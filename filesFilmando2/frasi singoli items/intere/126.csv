1;Growing up enjoying game shows, this movie captured the underbelly of games how tricks.
2;Great story, good acting and historically fun.
3;This film is an excellent character study.
4;Van Doren is a bit more toxic, in that he covers his deceitful nature with polish and charm.
5;The man could rob a bank while making the cops smile, so it's a very satisfying moment when he gets his just desserts.
6;Despite running over two hours, the film has such natural flow to it that you can't help but be absorbed in it from scene to scene.
7;bravo to Paul Attanasio for his exceptional screenplay.
8;one', the producers convince him to throw the game and elect the young, good looking and financially stable Charles Can Doren as the new winner.
9;He skyrockets to fame because of his charm and soon becomes the biggest winner the show ever had.
10;The cast is also exceptional, with Fiennes charming the pants off the audience and John Turturro delivering a remarkably layered performance as the jilted Herbie Stempel.
11;It appears that he and Scofield were really neck and neck in the Oscar race (Scofield was nominated for BAFTA and Oscar, while Turturro was nominated for the Globe and SAG) and I really wish that Turturro had prevailed, since he really is the best part of the film.
12;with snappy dialog, rich production values and an ensemble who sells every note (Paymer and Azaria are a marvelous pair), `Quiz Show' gets so much right I can't help but love it.
13;Robert Redford's QUIZ SHOW is an entertaining film with a solid cast that's only loosely based on the Twenty.
14;"one airing and Stempel's immediate departure, via ""taking a dive."""
15;these anomalies (and several more) aside, QUIZ SHOW is finely.
16;There's enough in it that's factually correct to give an overview of what turned out to be rigging of show outcomes on a grand scale.
17;It's a costume drama well.
18;star, but the movie is so good it earns 2.
19;This is the best film of 1994.
20;See, if we tell it like it is, we won't make money.
21;But what makes Quiz Show a cinematic marvel is its ability to keep the viewer involved while remaining unerringly faithful to the facts.
22;Fiennes is Charles Van Doren, the handsome, clean.
23;Also exceptional, but easy to overlook in the glow of the all.
24;force performances so essential to bringing the brilliant screenplay to life.
25;the result: a morality play that is at once gripping and entertaining.
26;it is only fitting that a movie whose theme is integrity is approached with such uncompromising honesty, and for that we should all be thankful.
27;Very thoughtful movie and super well done.
28;A thoughtful movie about choices and unforeseen results of those choices.
29;All adults and more mature teens would find this movie very interesting.
30;Quiz Show is one of those movies that never gets the attention it deserves.
31;The dialogue is fast and intelligent, and so nuanced by the actors that you really believe you are back in the age of Sputnik and cars with too much chrome.
32;handsome, articulate, witty, and gentile.
33;The film is a fascinating study of what people are willing to do to gain cash and notoriety, and the hidden costs of that behavior.
34;Paul Scofield, as Van Doren's father, is excellent in providing the moral compass which his son has somehow lost.
35;When he reminds his progeny that his corrupt actions reflect on the family name it moves a person to tears.
36;John Tuturro as Herb Stemple also does a terrific job as the Jewish counterpart to Van Doren.
37;John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish, seemingly media crazy Stempel.
38;all did a fine job as well.
39;In fact, I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job, because I liked them all.
40;Some very good acting, a nice script, good direction.
41;It's a very fine movie.
42;I chose it primarily because I was familiar with the quiz show scandals, but the film really brought history alive.
43;It was definitely a good film.
44;I recommend it for anyone (even those not watching it for an essay!)
45;This is an utterly brilliant film, to be sure, worthy of every star or series of stars ever given in cinematic history.
46;"Its prelude, alone, is worthy of 5 stars, as are its performances, screenplay, cinematography, and striking use of the song ""Mack the Knife"" ."
47;At the very least, Robert Redford should sit down and record his insights into this masterfully understated, superbly crafted, and exquistitely wrought drama.
48;But I also believe its finer points defy the first viewing, as every subsequent showing of the film has uncovered a new dynamic, a new layer, a new penetrating insight.
49;The use of the song belies the filmmakers' knowledge of its incendiary message and content .
50;(The story behind this is fascinating, but irrelevant.)
51;And yet: its exquisite disection of the 1950's in America, and the hopes, fears, insecurities, and aspirations that attended it, is shocking.
52;For the first time, it shows us the *entire* field of view, rather than a coquettish close.
53;This is the kind of filmmaking that all of Hollywood should aspire to.
54;And I defy any thinking, conscientious person to watch the entire movie and return to the opening scene without seeing it as a kind of overture to the film, reducing its themes and intentions into a brief and enticing summary.
55;Robert Redford does it again in this much lauded film that is flawlessly executed with pathos and suspense, and, incidentally, one of the top picks of 1994.
56;Quiz Show is the absorbing, engrossing story of tirumphs and downfalls (of both tv showbiz and personalities).
57;The cast is quite remarkable.
58;john Turturro is brilliant and sympathetically strikes a cord with us, Rob Morrow is nothing short of powerful, and Ralph Fiennes is stiffly and guiltily confused as one who has to live up to the incredible reputation of his father (played by Paul Scofield, who's absolutely terrific).
59;"The script is also extremely witty and literate
I:8894;60;The cinematography is very effective and observant (the game show owners says to Ralph Fiennes, It's okay, there's only the three of us, and the camera looks at Fiennes, towering over him ominously).
I:8894;61;Quiz Show is a masterpiece, a thriller with brains, a drama with heart.
I:8894;62;Robert Redford made a gem with this entertaining little movie.
I:8894;63;Smart actors, snappy dialog, art direction that captures a detailed slice of NY in the mid fifties.
I:8894;64;This fine movie has been on my shelf for years.
I:8894;65;the movie itself is excellent, albeit quite long.
I:8894;66;The cast and screenplay are both on a very high level.
I:8894;67;the line that stays with me the longest is that of the CEO of the program's sponsor, very well played by Martin Scorsese, to Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the federal investigator: """"You have to understand that the public has a very short memory,"""" he says with a grin."""
68;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
69;At any rate, this film excels on many levels.
70;To begin with, the cast and performances are just excellent.
71;Turturro excels as the completely unlikeable walking encyclopedia, Herb Stempel.
72;Goodwin's character is center stage throughout this movie, and he is played as an exceedingly complex character.
73;He still believes if you just present the truth to the public the correct outcome is inevitable.
74;He seems relieved to indict himself before Congress and the nation, but pays a heavy price for his confession.
75;Rounding out the cast is the excellent Paul Scofield as Mark Van Dorn, Charles' father.
76;"eyed idealist, and a tall shadow in which Charles has had to dwell until ""21"" comes along."
77;This fictional composite character is right at every turn, and the dishonored NBC employees even return to TV in the 60's with an even bigger hit .
78;in short, I highly recommend this film.
79;The clever and talented Robert Redford directed this engrossing snapshot of the decay of American moral standards with television quiz shows as the vehicle.
80;The brilliant Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's distinguished and unimpeachably honest and dignified, rich and famous poet father (a similar character to Sir Thomas More in A Man For All Seaons for which Scofield won an Oscar as Best Actor in 1966)
81;The film is entertaining on its own, but the filmmakers pulled some themes from The Threepenny Opera (Brecht's socialist critique of capitalism).
82;As social commentary, it does a good job of juxtaposing Turturro's powerlessness with Feinnes' privilege.
83;The salesman comes off as both confident and yet trustworthy.
84;Even though once the opening title sequence begins, we never revisit the salesman or the Cadillac, we understand that this is a film having to do with selling something.
85;television and entertainment is a bit like Mack the Knife, pearly white teeth but very sharp and biting.
86;Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability.
87;Only problem is, Marty is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture.
88;The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it.
89;in the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee.
90;an incredible film with a first.
91;And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans.
92;Although it happened long before i was born, this movie actually inspired me to look up the true events that went into it.
93;"I certainly remember the name ""Charles Van Doren."
94;Every actor is superb in here, from crooked NBC executives to the Stempel and Van Doren families.
95;"Veteran actor Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's father ""Mark"" and is a standout in that role."
96;the sad story, if this movie is true, is that the crooks basically got away with it, at least if you read the ending credits right after the movie ends.
97;Quiz Show is a remarkably good film, presenting in vivid detail an important if disillusioning piece of Americana.
98;I understand the events as presented here are quite accurate to the truth of the actual events, but the film is so gripping and so full of implications about the America that was and was yet to be that it has the appearance of a brilliant screen play made exclusively for Hollywood.
99;Honesty, integrity, greed (both personal and corporate), betrayal, politics, discrimination, disillusionment.
100;this movie is filled to the brim with these themes and many more besides.
101;one champion Herb Sempel is a contemporary version of Everyman, winning the acclaim he has sought his whole life only to lose it when America begins growing tired of this Jewish underdog (and I mention he was Jewish only because that fact does have some bearings in the story).
102;With ratings slipping, producer Don Enright compels him to take a dive so that he can be replaced by the charming, good.
103;Van Doren, with a lot of help from the producers, goes on a record.
104;the acting in this movie is top.
105;John Turturro is wonderful as Herb Sempel, David Paymer and Hank Azaria are convincingly slimy and fast.
106;talking as producers Albert Freedman and Dan Enright, and remarkably talented supporting players such as Paul Scofield and Martin Scorsese make this movie something special, but it is the performance of Rob Morrow in the role of lawyer Dick Goodwin and Ralph Phiennes as Charles Van Doren that really steal the show.
107;These are some complex characters: Sempel is a somewhat paranoid man obsessed with the fame that was taken away from him yet not without secrets himself, but Van Doren is exceedingly hard to read.
108;winning father proud of him and to step out from the shadows of the Van Doren name he secured by birthright alone.
109;Its subtleties make for great rewatchability, as everything that takes place is important, even though it may not seem so at the time.
110;Van Doren in particular is a marvelous character study in this amazing cinematic morality play.
111;having appeared on a game show myself, I thought I might be able to offer a unique perspective on this movie, but its lessons are undeniably universal.
112;Beyond providing over two hours of gripping entertainment, this movie compels you to learn something about yourself, and that is one of many reasons why Quiz Show is a certifiably five.
113;This is an excellent movie.
114;I thought that it was well done.
115;This is a great film on so many levels.
116;along the way, many subtle symbols are interjected which support this thesis, and it is these elements that raise the movie to the same level as some of the best films ever made.
117;what an amazing element, yet so inconspicuous that it passes largely undetected.
118;Quiz Show is packed with these.
119;making multiple viewings a highly rewarding experience.
120;It was an instant classic.
121;It has fantastic actors, unbelievable dialogue, and is a cute little story.
122;This reigns as my favorite movie of all time.
123;Programs must provide rapid fire entertainment to attract viewers and advertisers and reality rarely delivers the jaw.
124;Herbert Stempel appeared and won a string of victories that approached $100,000 in winnings.
125;"The show's producers then decided to bring in a more clean cut and ""proper"" contestant to win over the hearts of Americans (not to mention their sponsor), and they found this person in Charles Van Doren."
126;But a defiant Stempel, feeling cheated, moved to expose the show.
127;But the bygone audience for the new, and presumably innocent, medium of television felt betrayed.
128;Quiz Show, a dramatization of these scandals, manages to attain a high level of drama without resorting to violence or sex.
129;Pure character development moves the story along.
130;Herb Stempel, played brilliantly by John Turtorro, evolves from a confident but arrogant winner into a bitter and reckless fall guy.
131;In the end he confesses and pays a heavy price.
132;Quiz Show strives to make a point by fictionalizing certain aspects of fact.
133;It also presents a theory about how deceptions get propogated up the ranks, who ultimately takes the fall for them, and the effect such events have on the public.
134;He means all of us, the public, not just the characters in the movie.
135;The filmmakers had a bigger picture in mind, and to get that vision across they had to play with the story.
136;Quiz Show is, in the end, a great movie that invites reflection on a medium that has come to dominate our lives.
137;This is a very classy telling of a true story based on the game show, Twenty One.
138;For a low budget film, it recreates the era and mood quite well.
139;All the acting is top notch as well as the production design.
140;Robert Redford's masterwork may boast of hitting the mark with this full rounded portrait since the times of Lumet's Network.
141;And the illusion of seeing new talent to win is part of the collective unconscious.
142;Well written and better acted.
143;one of the top twenty American Films of the Nineties.
144;This movie has a very powerful message and give the reflective viewers lots to ponder about their own lives, their ability to go deeply into what motivates them, and also the consequences of taking or not taking personal responsibility for their own moral growth.
145;"This scene completely and surprisingly sets up the brilliance of the following two hours of cinema, called ""Quiz Show""."
146;"america's fascination with the sale of happiness is told through the lens of the infamous 1950's ""Twenty One"" quiz show scandal."
147;enter Charles Van Doren, family family and good looks to boot, who becomes the new darling of Twenty One.
148;the movie moves on with the investgation of Dick Goodwin, driven by passion for justice and a quest to find the truth.
149;But this film aims higher, much, much higher, and the results are simply impressive.
150;The illusion of happiness, so wonderfully ridiculed almost in the final credits as the audience is shown rollicking and screaming at the results of a television show.
151;all performances in this movie are grand, from John Turturro's manic Stempel to Ralph Fiennes slick Van Doren, even Scorese as the slimy sponsor.
152;Under Redford's smooth, stylistic direction, this film is a tribute to the late fifties as much as it is an expose.
153;this is one of those films that should be on more people's top ten lists.
154;It instructs without being preachy, and fully showcases the strength that cinema can carry.
155;older folks like me will thoroughly enjoy re.
156;The younger generation will thoroughly enjoy, and probably die laughing at how little was required back in those ancient times to keep the populace content and entertained.
157;Everyone knows Quiz Show is an amazing film.
158;"Jack Barry and Dan Enright were right back at it again making handsome sums on ""The Joker's Wild""."
159;show scandals that rocked the days of early television, Robert Redford's intelligent, absorbing drama digs into the murky ethics of mass.
160;Turturro and Fiennes are both excellent, playing antagonists whose ethnicity is as much a concern to image.
161;Paul Scofield won an Oscar for his turn as Van Doren's patrician father, while Rob Morrow is memorable as a Boston attorney who helps Turturro blow the whistle.
162;Quiz Show remains one of cinema's best meditations on our tricky dealings with the almighty tube.
163;Few movies have captured the risks and rewards of celebrity as well as this one.
164;"a sharp contrast from the portrayal of the ""old ways"" in the recent Kinsey movie."
165;There are great, important lessons for us all here.
166;As original music, it is amazing in its ability to create the mood of this era.
167;This is the Robert Redford's best movie in my opinion.
168;He does a great job with the period and the gets a great cast led by Ralph Fiennes to tell a personal story of Quiz Show scandals.
169;The bad guys are maybe too bold about their predictions of the future, because Redford knows the future already, but otherwise the movie flows nicely with the main characters facing all sorts of moral dilemmas, and answering them as they come along.
170;I am a fan of Robert Redford as both an actor and a director, and as the latter this is his crowning achievement.
171;But it also has an understanding look at it's characters and that is what won me over.
172;Quiz Show is powerful without getting in your face and moving without feeling manipulative.
173;Ralph Fiennes is fantastic so is Mr. Morrow and John Turturro is excellent.
174;If you never saw this then take the time to view great vintage filmmaking at it's best.
175;This amazing film, directed by Robert Redford, starring Rob Morrow, Ralph Fiennes, and John Turturo is a period film about the real life quiz show scandal of Twenty.
176;time favorite actor, with Ralph Fiennes coming in a distant second, followed by Robert Redford!I highly recommend purchasing your copy today!
177;Is there honesty in any show that has prizes involved?
178;"the Actors in ""Quiz Show"" play their characters realistically and creatively."
179;The script was brilliant and perfectly delivered by everyone in front of the cameras.
180;A thoroughly professional group effort.
181;winning contestants are given the answers to the questions on this popular game show.
182;Eventually, this illegal practice is discovered, investigated and finally, was the basis for the restructuring of television games shows.
183;i think that Ralph Fiennes did a marvelous job with his role of braniac to T. v. celebrity.
184;Very well made and great acting about a game show scandel based on a true story.
185;It is worth a watch.
186;This movie I found to be very entertaining and I adore all the actors.
187;The bonus is the story is based on actual events.
188;I highly recommend seeing this one
189;"The year is 1957, and everyone, it seems, is watching the popular TV game show, ""Twenty."
190;i was really surprised at how exciting this movie was.
191;It's got humor and drama and is filled with tension.
192;Fiennes portrays Van Doren as a witty, charming Connecticut Yankee from an influential family.
193;Morrow is excellent as the whistle.
194;the movie is a wonderful look back at a time when we as a people were so much more trusting and innocent.
195;This is a great movie.
196;The film gives a perfectly detailed feeling for the 1950's from the start.
197;cars, soundtrack, costumes, houses, the attitudes of the 50's.
198;the cast of the movie is great.
199;"ralph Fiennes (Charles van Doren) is perfect
I:8894;200;Robert Redford is probably a better director than actor, and that's saying a lot.
I:8894;201;They were America's first family of poetry.
I:8894;202;But the carefully nuanced portrayal of those who are pitched into parting with their values, piece by piece, and end up losing everything is a masterpiece.
I:8894;203;This is a movie one can watch over and over again.
I:8894;204;The first era of prime.
I:8894;205;There are two specific programs that represent the major changes.
I:8894;206;One is Dragnet, which was the first successful series that was filmed in Hollywood and represented the shift away from live television broadcast from New York.
I:8894;207;one contestants at the center of the storm.
I:8894;208;The great irony of the script by Paul Attanasion, based on Goodwin's book Remembering America: A Voice from the Sixties, is that Stempel wants to get Twenty.
I:8894;209;But the performances by Turturro and Finnes are so compelling that they keep this film grounded on the personal level, so that the larger social issues are lost in the personal wreckage of Stempel and Van Doren's lives.
I:8894;210;It was a time of innocence and the viewing community was deceived.
I:8894;211;And never again have the networks won that kind of public trust.
I:8894;212;In the film this role is played by Rob Morrow who is determined to uncover the deception.
I:8894;213;All the other actors are excellent too .
I:8894;214;Paul Scofield also shines in the role of Van Doran's father, who stands by his son even though the family is disgraced by the publicity.
I:8894;215;It is the nature of the times as well as the anti.
I:8894;216;eyed in front of that black and white set and admiring the contestants for being so smart.
I:8894;217;i was unprepared to love this film so much.
I:8894;218;There is tension throughout and consistently wonderful acting.
I:8894;219;The dialog was authentic and the actors all played their roles with subtlety.
I:8894;220;Quiz Show is a simply wonderful film and I give it one of my highest recommendations.
I:8894;221;Everytime I watch this film, I discover yet another layer.
I:8894;222;It's entertaining and intriguing, as well as beautifully written, directed, and acted.
I:8894;223;Watch it more than once and you'll realize how good it is.
I:8894;224;viewers loved the game show TWENTY.
I:8894;225;oNE and ratings went up with intelligent bright contestants vied for big monetary gifts.
I:8894;226;He was intelligent and smart, but the big boy network wanted someone more handsome and appealing.
I:8894;227;great acting, excellent director and compelling drama
I:8894;228;What a great job Robert Redford did in capturing the drama surrounding the episode and the tragedy of ruined lives portrayed in this outstanding film"
229;That was true back in the 50s and it's true in 2005.
230;Is this a film worth seeing?
231;What a great joy to again see the great Paul Scofield in another masterful portrayal of a real.
232;life character and a triumph for Robert Redford.
233;Great movie and well acted by the entire cast.
234;This film is a favorite of mine and I enjoy watching it over and over.
235;This is finely crafted, well acted, and engaging.
236;With the flood of big money, small brains quiz shows with multiple choice questions that have hit the air waves in the past year, no one can deny the prophetic power of the film.
237;And with great performances and a lack of clear good guys and bad guys, theres nothing that stops this from being one of the best film of the 90's.
238;The picture is very sharp, bright, steady, and clear with deep blacks and rich but subdued colors.
239;"QS is not merely a fascinating period piece of a landmark event in recent US history, but is also very much a ""man's movie""."
240;"What I mean by ""man's movie"" is that ""QS"" does a fine job of showing how men interact with each other at all levels, personally and professionally

248;The fact is that Quiz Show is, to my mind, one of the finest depictions of the television industry, 50's America, and morality (in a .
249;The stellar cast, led by Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow, turn in excellent performances .
250;The veritable Paul Scofield, a paragon of integrity, shines in his role as the patriarch and intellectual role model of the Van Doren family.
251;The scenes between him and Fiennes are notable for how much is communicated without actually being said.
252;Meanwhile, Rob Morrow (whose accent occasionally descends into farce) is excellent in his role as a tenacious investigator.
253;all in all, an excellent movie, and a testament to Redford's ability.
254;Rob Morrow steals the show!
255;The Bottom Line:With good performances by Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro, a soon.
256;forgotten Rob Morrow and others, Quiz Show is a fine showcase of acting talent, but it is also a very well.

258;Over the years director Robert Redford has made a number of splendid motion pictures.
259;"Redford won an Academy Award in his very first stab at directing with 1980's ""Ordinary People""."
260;"Likewise, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for 1992's magnificent ""A River Runs Through It"" and the 1998 film ""The Horse Whisperer""."
261;"directed film always has been 1994's ""Quiz Show""."
262;The networks quickly discovered that one of the best ways to achieve this end was to manipulate the results.
263;This strategy was quite successful for a number a years before one estranged contestant decided to blow the whistle on all of it.
264;"This is a film that commands your undivided attention from the outset and simply never lets go!There are really three principal charactors in ""Quiz Show""."
265;Enter one Charles Van Doran (played by Ralph Fiennes), a handsome, highly educated and captivating young man who possessed all of the charactoristics that both the sponser and the network were looking for.
266;Goodwin is a feisty and persistant son.
267;All three men are conflicted about their roles in this drama and soon Goodwin discovers that there are forces at the highest levels of both the government and corporate America that are out to discredit him.
268;Quiz Show features outstanding acting and a terrific script.
269;In my opinion this was one of the finest films made in the 1990's.
270;star cast in this is a great film, which is wonderfully acted and it is must.
271;A movie like Quiz Show is entertaining on so many levels.
272;"the opening sequence
I:8894;273;while all acting in this movie is outstanding, the direction almost transcends these solid performances, making the actors look like they are simply doing their job rather than carrying a story.
I:8894;274;that said, I really enjoyed Rob Morrow, perhaps for the surprising depth of his acting ability (I didn't know he had it in him).
I:8894;275;Ralph Fiennes seems like an actor you expect greatness from (and he delivers).
I:8894;276;And John Turturo is outstanding.
I:8894;277;This is certainly one those movies.
I:8894;278;Robert Redford expertly guides this film and gets excellent performances from his actors.
I:8894;279;Ralph Fiennes is cool and dashing as Charles Van Doren, a Columbia professor who became a national hero due to his success on the popular quiz show Twenty.
I:8894;280;Rob Morrow gives a solid performance as a young and aggressive federal investigator Dick Goodwin.
I:8894;281;He investigates the shows and along the way become friends with Van Doren.
I:8894;282;Paul Scofield gives his usual superb performance as Van Doren's father, the noted poet Mark Van Doren.
I:8894;283;David Paymer is perfectly slimy as Twenty.
I:8894;284;one's host Jack Barry with the right touch of mock importance.
I:8894;285;One of John Turturros best performances.
I:8894;286;Quiz Show and Schindler's List are Ralph Fiennes' best roles.
I:8894;287;The entire cast does a superb job of showing us what makes their characters tick.
I:8894;288;The story itself is an interesting look at how the early television industry developed.
I:8894;289;Great looking video and great audio.
I:8894;290;It's one of my favorites.
I:8894;291;That's why Robert Redford is a fantastic director, and Quiz Show is a fantastic film.
I:8894;292;the movie was pretty much destined for success.
I:8894;293;known as an excellent director.
I:8894;294;The entire cast is full of stars (and a few director cameos)"
295;known name on the list, at the time, was Mira Sorvino, whose big break came the next year.
296;The acting and script are, of course, exceptional, as is Redford's direction.
297;The pacing is phenomenal, even more impressive given the movies two.
298;"At least two critics have called it one of the thousand best films ever made (it made both the Guardian list and Peter Travers' list for Rolling Stone), and there is certainly some merit to the claim
I:8894;299;And not just once, but twice!There are many, many reasons this movie succeeds so marvelously, but I would like to focus on three.
I:8894;300;first, this movie benefits from an exceedingly fine cast.
I:8894;301;Not merely the leads, but many of the lesser roles are filled with extremely good actors and actresses.
I:8894;302;He seems the very embodiment of the man of reason, erudition, and courtesy portraying Mark van Doren, and his pain upon learning his beloved son has lost his teaching position at Columbia is one of the great poignant moments in the film.
I:8894;303;Look very carefully at the scene where several attractive coeds interrupt Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow and you will spot Calista Flockhart (a. k. a. Ally McBeal).
I:8894;304;a second reason this film succeeds so well is its tremendous period feel.
I:8894;305;QUIZ SHOW does a great job of [pulling] you in and giving you an almost tangible sense of time and place.
I:8894;306;finally, the movie is easily one of the most accurate historical films I have ever seen, although drama is never sacrificed for the mere sake of being accurate.
I:8894;307;If one has done any reading about the scandals or perhaps if one remembers the events, the film constantly impresses with the amount of accurate detail it contains.
I:8894;308;but if you watch, or rewatch, this film, please note those references to Arkadelphia!
I:8894;309;moving. . . the subject is important but the movie is stretched out to make a full.
I:8894;310;This movie captures the essence of the 1950's quiz show scandals, at least as far as the show 21 .
I:8894;311;known fixed quiz shows and scandals of the era, but this was by far the most interesting, because of the personalities involved.
I:8894;312;class Charles Van Doren is recreated beautifully here with the acting performances of John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes.
I:8894;313;This marvelous film has been rightly praised for the excellence of its actors and the intelligence and wit of its dialogue.
I:8894;314;taught proficient,and the relatively new medium, television itself, represent the unbeatable wave of a debased future.
I:8894;315;For its poise and shrewd wit in illuminating this decline, the film deserves the highest marks.
I:8894;316;Although it's overdone in parts, particularly Rob Morrow's role, many of the other actors do such a superlative job here that the film approaches masterpiece status.
I:8894;317;Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro and, of course, Paul Schofield are three of the very finest actors working today and each is up to his best here.
I:8894;318;Another performer who has been very good whenever I've seen him, but who seems to be highly underrated, is David Paymer who also brings a subdued intensity to his role as the producer at the center of things.
I:8894;319;Although the plot, based on the notorious government investigations of the game show frauds of the late 50's, is a bit loose ended, the performance by these four actors is just splendid and overcomes any script shortcomings.
I:8894;320;I remember seeing QUIZ SHOW in the theater some fifteen years ago and being really impressed.
I:8894;321;The movie may take a few liberties with the actual happenings of the quiz show scandals of the late 50's but it stays close to the facts while telling the story concisely and understandably to those who have little background about the events.
I:8894;322;And the film nostalgically and genuinely portrays New York City in the 1950's.
I:8894;323;john Turturro is excellent as Herb Stempel a nerdy young Jewish guy from Queens with an encyclopedia like mind and a nagging wife.
I:8894;324;Ralph Fiennes is equally good in his role as the White, Anglo.
I:8894;325;And YouTube even provides some vintage footage of Stempel, Van Doran and game show host Jack Barry on the game show, """"Twenty."""
326;qUIZ SHOW is an entertaining, thought provoking drama that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.
327;And I loved the two versions of MACK THE KNIFE that bookend the film.
328;It's one of my five favorite films of all time.
329;"as a screenplay, it's brilliantly done
I:8894;330;perfect"
331;I have loved this film since the first time I saw it and re.
332;watched it countless times, marveling each time at how each scene makes its point, reveals its characters and moves on to build a cohesive whole.
333;and I remember it every time I watch the film .
334;is in the wrenching and remarkable scene where Charlie finally has to admit to his father, in his Columbia University classroom .
335;Paul Scofield is one of the best actors ever, with a marvelous and expressive face.
336;The movie does a good job of capturing the time period.
337;this movie draws you in from the very first scene and has you firmly in it's grip until the closing credits.
338;the movie, which is set in the '50's, is filled with characters you care about, well acted, every nuance well established and played by a magnificent cast.
339;"It's more like ""I told you so"" reaction."
340;the movie has something to say not just about games shows but the power of television as a whole.
341;But the movie's true greatness lies in the vivid and memorable characters in the movie.
342;Ah, the good ol' Fifties.
343;well aware of the contests' new, uniquely thrilling live entertainment, studio executives and sponsors quickly capitalized on their appeal, eager to maximize the resulting profits.
344;A brilliant intellectual who nevertheless felt eternally inferior to his Pulitzer Prize.
345;"based on former Congressional investigator and Kennedy speechwriter Richard Goodwin's ""Remembering America: A Voice From the Sixties"" and scripted by Paul Attanasio, Robert Redford's 1994 film brilliantly traces the ""Twenty."
346;"one"") musically pulls every last tooth out of the song's sharp."
347;Quiz Show has been described, in turns, as a political thriller, a morality play, a parable on the loss of innocence and a fact.
348;"based drama
I:8894;349;But this is also a fascinating exploration of the scandal's underlying psychology"
350;of the movie's tremendous cast, John Turturro, Ralph Fiennes and Paul Scofield particularly give standout performances as the nerdy, deeply humiliated Herb Stempel, the dazzling Ivy Leaguer Charles Van Doren and his intellectually brilliant, unwaveringly supportive and profoundly moral father Mark, who can snap out a Shakespeare quote appropriate to any situation at the drop of a hat.
351;Quiz shows are more popular than ever.
352;Give the public what they want .
353;Millionaire, anyone?Also recommended:Remembering America : A Voice From the SixtiesAmerican Justice .
354;This movie is just plain excellent.
355;The acting, direction, soundtrack, costumes and cinematography are just tops.
356;The story is very interesting and the characters are rich and explored wonderfully.
357;It is well balanced and done so well that I can only say check it out.
358;thus I must discuss it, as it has bothered me for years.
359;though first I will say that, on the whole, the film is rather dull, the one good thing about it is John Turturro who offers a brilliant, vivid performance, I will watch the movie when it's on occasionally simply to listen to him, he's a delight.
360;Rob Morrow was good in his roll, he can't really be a lead actor, but he shines always in supporting rolls.
361;je ne sais quoi, a fascinating allure, a burning, smoldering Something, and then you never see it again.
362;Every time I think of this movie, my thoughts go directly to the cake.
363;perfect people gathering to to eat perfectly?
364;When perfect rich creatures have cake they receive a thin wedge and eat primly and perfectly and moderately with utmost control?
365;I have no words for this, it's stunning.
366;such a tiny cake for all of those people?
367;sized pieces for all to enjoy .
368;not lost on me, I assure you, but the business with the cake stands as one of those heinous and detestable things in life that, well.
