1;this movie would win that Oscar.
2;It was amusing and entertaining.
3;See this one for the enjoyment of it.
4;It's an adorable, perfect film.
5;Charming, well written and performed.
6;Handsome and disarmingly vulnerable within the confines of a pretty high concept feature.
7;Enjoyed this movie and wanted to watch it again.
8;Glad that they finally put it back to watch.
9;Warren Beatty did a good job on this one.
10;It is always good when those of us who might be a bit of a couch potato could possible be the best at some difficult sport.
11;Fantasy always entertains and relaxes me.
12;We have watched this movie several times over the years and have enjoyed it every time.
13;This is a charming classic comedy.
14;And he wants that life back!
15;The humor is sweet and silly and the jock hero charming.
16;A perfect movie to watch in the run up to the Super Bowl.
17;There are some very funny lines and the wife and secretary are very well played this time around.
18;Was looking for simple fun entertainment today.
19;Great way to spend a couple relaxing hours after a stress.
20;All I can say is that he really shines in this film.
21;Mind you, he is helped tremendously by the supporting cast.
22;Even so, I prefer the 1978 version.
23;It just seems to have more charm, more innocence.
24;it also has a touch of class, mainly due to the presence of James Mason, in the role of Mr Jordan, who has to step in and try to make thinks right with the prematurely breathless Joe.
25;Joe is understandably miffed at his mistreatment since he and his team were due to play in the superbowl, Joe's one dream.
26;Mr Jordan offers Joe a number of alternative routes back into the mortal realm.
27;"drive on the Farnsworth model
28;On the one hand Joe, despite his new.
29;found wealth, still has super.
30;Farnsworth has to straighten up his corporate image to impress his new lady.
31;we have the fun of watching him struggle back into his old shoes and take his disbelieving associates with him.
32;The story is fun but it's the character's friendships that keep us watching.
33;Any challenge faced with a smile is much easier.
34;The movie itself is great, I bought this as a gift for my mother.
35;This was a humorous and enjoyable movie.
36;In this reincarnation, Joe Pendleton is a quarterback determined to win the Super bowl.
37;A genuine fun loving movie with no pretensions, perfect for an afternoon frolic.
38;Very engaging, clean, fairly decent acting.
39;I would recommend it for a date night .
40;This movie has been made several times and in my opinion this is the best of the lot.
41;The casting for various characters is about a good as it gets for a movie of this type.
42;Warren Beatty directed and stars in the film and does a great job in both roles.
43;This film has it all, love, tragedy, suspense and comedy.
44;This is my favorite movie.
45;I saw it as a teen and I was part of the 1970's fitness craze.
46;I also loved the music, which was so uplifting and at all the right moments.
47;I own the video, and I have loaned it to young people, and they love it.
48;In my opinion, this was one of many wholesome movies of this time, the 1970's, like Star Wars, China Syndrome,Space Odyssey,Oh God, Willie Wonka, What's Up Doc.
49;This one is still my favorite, with the original Star Wars a close second.
50;The chemistry is special, and I'm a sucker for a real happy ending with a lesson.
51;When I'm down, this is guaranteed to lift my spirit and make me smile.
52;One of the Best movies of all times!
53;charles Grodin, James Mason, Buck Henry, Jack Warden and Dyan Cannon are all excellent.
54;Still funny after all these years.
55;I am a sucker for movies that underdogs win and it also has a nice twist on a love story.
56;I keep revisiting this movie.
57;Heaven can wait,it is a down to earth movie,loved by so many people.
58;Old yet entertaining for my whole family!
59;This one in particular has it all.
60;mystery, action, great message, and yes.
61;Truly a wonderful story that also allows the viewer to really consider the topic of life after death.
62;Warren Beatty is absolutely the best in this film.
63;One of my all time favorites.
64;A great family film that leaves you feeling good at the end of it.
65;this movie is a keeper!The writing is bright and funny, and the cast is spot.
66;Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, James Mason, Jack Warden, Buck Henry . . . what an amazing, talented group of actors, each doing what they do best.
67;Heaven Can Wait is one of those gems that will make you laugh out loud, no matter how many times you have seen it before.
68;also pick upDefending Your Life, by Albert Brooks.
69;Hmmm . . . these two movies would make a great double feature.
70;Rarely has a story been this whimsical and fun.
71;top performance of socialite wife Dyan Cannon.
72;The best moments are with the genteel, easygoing James Mason and trainer Jack Warden (a nice guy who I always felt got short.
73;I think the ending could have been better but is an excellent movie to watch.
74;One of my all time favorites.
75;This movie is over twenty years old and still has stying power with it's fun and unique story.
76;New and old viewers will fall in love with it!
77;I've seen this movie before and always loved the way the movie focuses on how one man can change the life of many give a second chance.
78;I love older movies, but for the life of me.
79;this is a great movie.
80;I enjoyed it and so did my husband.
81;I loved this movie because it was deep and entertaining.
82;I recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a calm, but good story.
83;This is my all time favorite movie.
84;The last scene when He says don't worry and She says so your the Quarter back is great, they say do I know you.
85;A very special movie for couples in Love.
86;This was such a cute movie and sooo funny.
87;Diane cannon plays the crazy wife and is so good in this part.
88;All the acting and characters are great.
89;It is the kind of movie that makes you really feel good after you watch it.
90;Good fun and a great cast.
91;A regular guy placed in a position of wealth and power but is still able to keep his humanity.
92;Funny and sentimental without being too cheezy.
93;Makes me remember the good old days when the Rams were in LA!
94;Supporting cast is outstanding .
95;This is a GREAT movie.
96;Never the less, it is one great movie for all ages.
97;Can't believe this was an Oscar nominee.
98;I prefer this original version.
99;I would recommend this movie to anyone!
100;It was nice seeing it again.
101;I saw part of the movie on TV and saw something in it that I wanted to have in my library.
102;I was most happy to find the VHS tape and ordered it immediately.
103;I have enjoyed it each time I have viewed it!
104;This is a romantic fantasy a guy that is a quarterback for the Rams.
105;Now they got to find him a new body.
106;It's also a love story and about friendship' It's a nice clean movie.
107;Warren Beatty is great in this movie.
108;I really like this motion picture.
109;The combo of Warren Beatty and Julie Christie has always pleased me (my absolute favorite of theirs.
110;and one of my favorite films, period, is """"McCabe Mrs. Miller"""")."""
111;"What I think is special about ""Heaven Can Wait"" is the great supporting cast."
112;All are wonderful and wonderfully funny.
113;James Mason plays the sophisticated guide, Mr. Jordan, to a tee, while Buck Henry's dry wit hits with pin.
114;Jack Warden is always solid and this film was certainly no exception.
115;She is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses ever to grace the screen, and I felt her talents were wasted for much of the film.
116;however, everything else is so good, and the performances so rich, that I can't help giving this movie a very solid 8 out of 10.
117;laughs, this one doesn't disappoint.
118;This is a terrific movie and I wanted to share it with my sons and a friend of ours.
119;I live in the USA and bought a product that is sold in the USA!
120;Have always found it to be a fun, entertaining movie.
121;Stellar cast with stellar performances.
122;I very much enjoyed this film, and was grateful to find it on.
123;"Diane Cannon steals this movie as the murderous wife
124;light entertaining film to kill a night.
125;This is a wonderful film.
126;So he gets to a weigh.
127;Great acting, but the underlying theme of how our actions affect others and that there is another reality after life made it more enjoyable.
128;When it was over, I knew my life's ambition.
129;To become a saxophone playing football quarterback, and fall in love with a beautiful English girl.
130;Well, I never played football or anything more musical than the kazoo, but I still love beautiful English girls, with Christie at the top of my list.
131;I'll just say that this is a funny, easy film to like with Beatty giving his most mannered comedy performance, with able support by the always funny Grodin, the hit and miss Cannon (who's very on here) the enjoyable Warden and the great James Mason.
132;But still, I love this movie.
133;One of my all time favorites.
134;This is a good film for just about anyone with a good imagination.
135;It is a funny yet touching story with good production values.
136;the music for the movie was outstanding!
137;Great movie, poor treatment by Paramount.
138;An appeal is issued to management in the form of the magnificent James Mason as Mr. jordon, who is left with the task of finding Joe a suitable body to make his return to earth in after we find that Joe's body was cremated before we could work out all the red tape at Heaven's departure terminal.
139;down the best of the bunch.
140;Beatty gets credit for bulking up for the role and amazingly has no credibility issues with the casual audience as an aspiring pro QB with eyes on a shot at the Super Bowl.
141;His natural comic timing and comfort zone chemistry with Julie Christy make this film a real keeper.
142;I have seen this version many times and still enjoy it.
143;Julie Christy is also a lovely, serious counterweight.
144;Part murder mystery and part comedy over heaven's bungling of Beatty's untimely death set the stage for a match (love and new identity) made in heaven.
145;It is a deeper movie than it seems.
146;Great story, great chemistry with the two characters, a feel good movie, plus in some ways motivational to do something out of your comfort zone.
147;Everyone played their role well.
148;Love story and murder mystery.
149;It is a fun movie with some good laughs in it.
150;This is a warm and fuzzy comedy for the whole family.
151;It's got a great, other.
152;The cast is classic, star studded and very 1970's.
153;Warren Beatty is irresistable and charming.
154;Julie Christie is convincing and still looks beautiful.
155;Cannon and Charle Grodin are hilarious.
156;A bit of a tear jerker with great original score.
157;Of the other movies like this one, this is my favorite.
158;All the characters are perfect matches to the actor.
159;(I'm thinking of taking up hip.
160;but almost everyone seems to be in agreement that this is a charming fantasy with a lot of heart.
161;natured movie, perhaps the lightest fare that Warren Beatty ever produced.
162;In that, this movie pays homage to earlier classics like It's A Wonderful Life as well as its source film, Here Comes Mr. Jordan.
163;Speaking of Mr. Jordan, while many of the reviewers here duly praise Beatty, Julie Christie and comic villains, Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin (perfect pairing), it also bears mentioning that James Mason is perfectly cast in what would have been the title role if they hadn't gone and changed the title.
164;It's hardly a stretch for him, but like the rest of the cast he seems to be having a great time.
165;In fact, that's one of the secondary pleasures of HEAVEN CAN WAIT.
166;When the remake is the one that people remember, it must be good.
167;Hard to classify this as a sports movie, but it is.
168;This has to be one of the nicest films which Warren Beatty has ever been in, and such a likable character, too.
169;there are so many wonderful parts of this film.
170;Jack Warden is superb as the coach who has to be persuaded that it is, indeed, Warren Beatty, and he goes a long way """"in faith"""" to accept it as true, especially in light of the fact that Beatty has entered into the body of a very wealthy man, and the team doesn't want to have some """"rich guy"""" owning the team."""
171;But they are inspiring, in a quirky kind of way.
172;Heaven Can Wait is a great classic film, and you would do well to add it to your collection.
173;A Marvelous soundtrack as well.
174;Joe Pendleton is one of the most delightful and endearing characters of the past 3 decades.
175;It's Warren Beatty's best performance pre.
176;bUGSY and his best directing efforts, surpassing his work on both BUGSY and REDS.
177;HEAVEN CAN WAIT is better than the original HERE COMES MR. JORDAN: It's better cast, better told and extremely heart warming.you ache when Pendleton is taken from earth twice (but not in the order you think would elicit the pain).
178;It's marvelous entertainment that blends in an afterlife snafu, populist politics, slapstick comedy, a really sweet romance, and no less than three garish murder attempts.
179;up quarterback in an era in which Los Angeles still fielded a professional football team.
180;The administrator, Mr. Jordan (James Mason), offers to remedy the goof.
181;But Joe is adamant about returning to human form.
182;He's got a Superbowl to play in.
183;Joe can occupy a body once its original soul has left .
184;He decides to inhabit Farnsworth's body after all.
185;i'll try to refrain from the gush, but I freaking love this movie.
186;Warren Beatty is solid and wonderfully deadpan here.
187;I like the energy he exudes, how he maintains an irrespressible sense of physicality.
188;"His supporting cast is brilliant, from James Mason and his Old World elegance to the fussy Buck Henry to the wickedly funny Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin (who plays Farnsworth's ""personal private executive secretary"" and also Farnsworth's wife's lover)."
189;Max takes a heck of a convincing.
190;there are so many clever bits and gags, one comic set piece after another, and, no, I won't ruin them by mentioning them.
191;I'll just reiterate that Dyan Cannon and Grodin are outstanding.
192;In my view, one of the best films ever made.
193;Not often reviewed as such, in part because it's a comedy (very few comedies win Oscars, as well).
194;It's well written, directed brilliantly by Buck Henry and the performances are impeccable.
195;This is a movie about magic and even if you don't believe in angels, reincarnation, soul mates or other strange phenomena, this movie will win you over with its charm, humor and surprises.
196;it marks one of the greatest performances (by Warden) in film history.
197;a good clean movie that is as enjoyable to watch the thirtieth time as it was the very first time
198;Heaven Can Wait is a perfect film .
199;it's funny, poignant, has a couple of unexpected plot twists,features Warren Beatty at his most sincere and beautiful .
200;a wonderful investment of time and energy.
201;this is a great movie, with honest emotions.
202;See it and enjoy it.
203;Some of my favorite actors and actresses.
204;While the original has its points, this is just a fun remake with a more comedic take.
205;Dated of course but the humor is timeless.
206;Beattie and this team nailed the concept.
207;I'm surprised it took me so long to see it.
208;Great way to spend an afternoon A must see
209;I have always loved Heaven can Wait!
210;Warren Beatty does a great job It's a movie that makes you want to crawl into a nice comfy chair w/ a warm blanket and hot chocolate and enjoy the show!!!
211;This was very entertaining and it was fun to see Julie Christi again.
212;She has long been a favorite of mine.
213;Interesting take on heaven and getting new bodies.
214;warren is superb, Julie perfect, Jack makes me sad evertime he realizes he lost his friend Joe for the second time.
215;Dyann and her naughty cohort play the perfect villians.
216;I was a fan of this film when it first came out in the theaters.
217;"With an entertaining music score, ""Heaven Can Wait"" is very well representative of the late 1970's romantic comedies."
218;A story of poignance, beauty, and even fun (!)
219;"
220;He was very skilled at that sport and it lead him to start the next game.
221;He and Mr. Jordan, the person who took his body to early, started looking for a new body.
222;Betty was a teacher who had a problem with the company Farnsworth works for.
223;the movie is based on fantasy and has a little bit of comedy.
224;All of these characters played a major role in the movie and added humor to the story line.
225;good cast, interesting story line, a little humor, what's not to like?
226;Beatty is as charming as one man can be.
227;BTW guys this is a great film that appeals to both men and women equally .
228;If you watch, be sure to have a glass of wine or a couple of beers so it makes you laugh.
229;Seriously, one of the best movies for all audiences.
230;Gets you right in the heart.
231;Sports, love, laughter, crying, drama .
232;I thought it was great then and still think that is a very good movie.
233;anyway, I liked the movie very much.
234;It is as entertaining now as it was when first released.
235;Beatty and Christie are excellent as the couple whose attraction stands the test of his several incarnations.
236;As Joe Pendleton, he is imminently likable but also quite strong willed and intelligent.
237;the story has been rehashed in many reviews so I'll skip the details here but suffice to say that it is fairly unique and very well.
238;The film is both funny and engaging, you will defintely be anxious to find out how it ends and that alone speaks well for the film.
239;Heaven Can Wait gets my highest recommendation and I can only dream of a day when we see a romantic comedy with this level of intelligence again.
240;The two leading characters, have ideal on.
241;screen chemistry"
242;"back
243;Set at this stunning 1930's era magnificent Georgian country.
244;Jack Warden fans will probably agree it's his best """"silver screen"""" roll of a lifetime, as the LA Rams coach who goes out on a limb for his star """"protege""""."""
245;"This film will especially touch socially conscientious champions of the underdog"", and ""died in the wool romantics""."
246;a delightful, palpable tale of the human condition.
247;It is one of my favorite movies.
248;Its a great movie to watch over and over
249;As a Filoli docent I was primarily interested in the use of the setting but was pleasantly surprised by a fun movie.
250;This is definitely one of those 'just sit back and enjoy' movies.
251;This VHS was in perfect shape (we wore out our original) and we enjoy the movie over and over again.
252;I think that Christie's performance at the Golden Globes made me love her even more than I did when I first saw Heaven Can Wait.
253;True, I would argue that her performance in Latter Day Saints was her best, but still. . . .
254;I have always really enjoyed this movie.
255;This movie was funny, light hearted, and kept its story going.
256;Plus, it's from the 80's!
257;This is an all time favorite movie.
258;Even though I have watched it a dozen times, I still enjoyed watching it again.
259;Jack Warden is perfect in his role as was Mr. Jordan and Sisck the Butler.
260;This is a very old movie but it is terrific.
261;it has alot of humor but there is a good story too.
262;The acting and writing are terrific.
263;everyone would enjoy this movie.
264;When I first saw this movie, I thought it was funny.
265;In my book it is a classic!
266;Warren Beatty does a superb job in both acting and collaborating on the script.
267;In this movie he is one of the quarterbacks of the Los Angeles Rams.
268;well, I won't spell the beans.
269;I found the film both entertaining and most enjoyable.
270;It is the type of film that will stay with you and many years later you just might want to see it again and you will!
271;I gave it five stars because everybody in the cast and in the support team did a marvelous job.
272;If you have not seen this film I strongly recommend it.
273;It is so easy and fun too!
274;I liked the movie already before and having it as part of our video collection was worth it.
275;The package arrived swiftly and it was in good condition.
276;Other than some mature scenes and lite gun violence it is a movie for all ages above 10yrs of age.
277;My son loved it and couldn't believe it was a movie from, way BACK THEN!
278;Great for young and old, have teenagers that enjoyed the movie!Sad in some parts and comical in other parts of the movie.
279;His total understanding of each scene combined with his command of orchestral nuance is evident as the film glides along on the rails of Grusin's compositions.
280;There are a couple of good question here that are answered: Does God make make mistakes and can you bargain with God?Substitute the word God with life and you have a doable answer.yes.
281;If one is committed to taking the risk of one's convictions and having faith, then life is full of second chances.
282;Well acted, directed and written.
283;A message comes up saying it won't play in this area or something to that effect.
284;Worth a watch if you have the spare time.
285;This remake of the 1941 movie Here Comes Mr Jordan is excellent.
286;A great plot, an all star ensemble cast, beautifully filmed at the historic Filoli estate, this romantic comedy fantasy movie has it all.
287;The acting is terrific .
288;One of my favorite movies!
289;My kids enjoyed it as well.
290;I also suggest a modern day version of this movie.
291;It was sure great to see that the price had dropped so much.
292;Great casting across the boardL Charles Grodin, Jack Warden.
293;Manages to achieve an unequivocal sweetness despite its morbid premise,
294;"An excellent choice for the ""Chick Flick"" section of your collection."
295;Highly recommend it, a classic, funny and smart, I can watch it over and over again.
296;fantasy, humor, great script, charming actors, and a goosebump and tear.
297;Beatty's best without any doubt and one of the top two or three in its genre.
298;A great date movie, too.
299;Eye candy for both sexes, lots of laughs, and snuggles at the end.
300;One of my favorite movies, but I only had it in VHS, which in of no value to me.
301;It holds up well after 16 years.
302;I recommend it if you ned a rainy day family movie for kids 10 and up.
303;While riding on his bike he is hit by a truck.
304;But the body is cremated.
305;(This is a hilarious sequence.)
306;But in the clutch he comes up with some very interesting ideas.
307;He decides to save her village and marry her.
308;as everything starts to come together for Joe, he is told that his temporary arrangement has come to an end and must give up Leo's body.
309;Joe refuses but Julia and Tony's latest attempt succeeds.
310;Everything is now fine so Mr. Jordan returns to the weigh station and Joe's memories go with him .
311;this is a fantasy film (Rams winning a Super Bowl while in LA!)
312;and it works very well on this level.
313;Co writer Elaine May is known as a great comedy writer and she worked perfectly with Beatty.
314;he created the smash it Get Smart.
315;Having these two collaborate with Beatty was a great stroke of genius.
316;She hits every comic note perfectly.
317;When she needs to be subtle, she is.
318;The rest of the cast is also perfection.
319;this is a great comic farce that you'll enjoy from many vantage points.
320;it has so many great, funny, lines, and ever some very touching moments.
321;it's Buck Henry at his best (wriring and acting with that subtle, wry humor that showed itself so well both here, and the Original Get Smart!
322;It is just one of those movies you can watch whenever it comes on.
323;Beatty is likable as the football pro who dies before his time and Julie Christie looks as good and as sexy as ever!
324;Jack Warden is always welcome in any film.
325;It still holds up today as a very good romantic/comedy.
326;i came to the conclusion That Amazon has everything.
327;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
328;When I found it I jumped on it!
329;It was fun, funny, and a little touching.
330;I have good memories of the movie, the friend I saw it with, and our discussion after the film ended.
331;i rediscovered it a couple of years ago on Amazon Prime, and have watched it two or three times.
332;It's been fun to revisit it.
333;The casting is great, the characters very funny.
334;Beatty isn't always appreciated or noticed for his comic timing, but it's precise and spot.
335;i agree with the reviewers who say that the strength of the story is in the characters and their relationships.
336;This is an entertaining remake of an old, funny, black and white movie.
337;I like the original better, but this one is definitely entertaining.
338;"I first saw ""Heaven Can Wait"" merely by accident when it came out in 1978
339;Warren Beatty and Julie Christie are both excellent and Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin are hilarious in their supporting roles.
340;The best """"actor"""" though is the script."""
341;Just good old fun as well as a touching story.
342;I found the movie very enjoyable.
343;"The story line is heart warming
344;What a fox and the rest of the cast are wonderful.
345;It's funny and sad at the same time.
346;Excellent performances from the entire cast.
347;I enjoyed this movie very much.
348;It was a neat concept and was, at times, humorous, while at the same time very thoughtful and heart warming.
349;The movie is way dated now in terms of technical and aesthetic production values, but we still love it.
350;The story is fun, well constructed.
351;The script is witty and sweet.
352;There is such heart here, without the sacrifice of wit and humor.
353;It's a love story, of course.
354;The thing is full of rich characters.
355;It's just an old classic I like to watch every few years.
356;a good movie always a good watch over the years not like what comes out of hollywood these days good with or without popcorn
357;I'm a big Julie Christie fan She was terrrific.
358;Just all around good entertainment for an evening of nostalgia.
359;This is in fact the third best film of all time.
360;By far, it is the best romantic comedy.
361;Warren Beatty is so good at light comedy, and he surrounds himself with great character actors.
362;Football for guys, and romance for girls.
363;Classic comedy concept, mostly a guy flick, heavy football theme but some deeper life/religious aspects.
364;Warren Beatty performs well in role, fairly funny.
365;The film, Heaven Can Wait, is a lighthearted romp through a series of misadventures which brings positive resolutions to several awkward human situations"
366;It is an emotionally touching film, and well worth viewing.
367;This is one of those rare gems where the remake outdoes the original.
368;"Here Comes Mr. Jordan is a wonderful film, but ""Heaven Can Wait"" is even more delightful."
369;It's full of fun and sweetness.
370;Timeless classic funny,sad and well written good story.
371;It's a remake of mr. Jordan and another good movie to watch with a bowl of popcorn.
372;Some films have that magical ability to cleanly entertain the viewer, and make us feel good.
373;Because this film really shines with an entertaining plot with a moral lesson, a touching love interest, superb acting by the entire cast, a touch of class, and yes, a touch of that magic that some films manage and some don't.
374;others here do that very well.
375;Suffice to say I think that almost anyone with a pulse will be touched by, and entertained by, this excellent film.
376;Actors are great and story line is even better.
377;"I have seen it a number of times and it always seems fresh
378;Heaven Can Wait offers a great cast, a timeless story and a pure heart.
379;The music score alone, which I think was nominated for an Academy Award, is beautiful and only helps build the story.
380;I highly recommend this movie.
381;However, with such a fine cast, great writing and swiftly paced story line this film still maintains it originality and timeless story of love, kindness and fulfillment of life's dreams.
382;After all this time, I still love this movie.
383;Yeah, wouldn't it be nice if life actually worked out so the good guys win?
384;I dearly love this show.
385;My husband has always liked it a lot, so I really bought it for him.
386;Now that I've seen it again, I understand why he likes it so much.
387;It's a very entertaining movie with lots of laughs and great characters.
388;If you have seen it, I'll bet you are ready to see it again.
389;This should be a required feel good movie.
390;One of my favorite older movies.
391;It may be Warren Beatty's best one.
392;I'll write you a 'script to watch movies.
393;This movie made me laugh and passed the afternoon.
394;For any baby boomers, this is a rather nostalgic movie.
395;Funny to see Beatty, Christie et al on the silver screen again.
396;We watched it with the family, it was entertaining.
397;All liked it but it was a little predictable but still enjoyed it.
398;While not the same type of theme, I put the story line on par with The Bishop's Wife (Cary Grant).
399;I was able to watch this with my mom.
400;I enjoyed the movie for what it was and laughed out loud several times.
401;I saw this when it first came out and probably enjoyed it more today.
402;This version of the Mr. Jordan story is so much more well.
403;acted than the older version.
404;And what a great cast.
405;James Mason is classic in this.
406;was a hoot to see all the 70's in fashions and hair.
407;three years after it's screen release, the delightful Warren Beatty film still has the power to enchant and make me smile.
408;Dyan Cannon hasn't changed at all through the years and is as beautiful now as she was then.
409;The entire cast brings the story of a brand new angel who wanted to save Joe from so much pain at his death that he brought him out of his body early.
410;to the delight of audiences, Beatty tries valiantly to be Farnsworth, but finds it impossible because he has a basic good.
411;Follies and surprises follow Joe in his new life, but it was temporary and the murderers are still lurking.
412;still, it is a feel.
413;good five star movie, whether a scene was cut or not.
414;It's very touching and funny.
415;Our family also liked the movie.
416;He wanted to maintain it within our library.
417;He thought it was a fair price.
418;This is a remake that is done well.
419;Warren Beatty does a great job.
420;After revisiting this Beatty masterpiece, I agree with everything in the other reviews.
421;This is in my top 10 movies and definately number 1 or 2 in romantic comedies.
422;i must mention the musical score by Dave Grusin.
423;the writing, acting, directing and cast all perfect.
424;The great soundtrack is just icing on the cake.
425;A much better film than the Chris Rock remake.
426;Beatty picked a sound project, a remake of the popular Robert Montgomery film, Here Comes Mr. Jordan.
427;eventually Beatty is given a new life, that of a wealthy industrialist with an international reputation of polluting the environment and doing whatever else it takes to win.
428;An immediate change is observed after Julie Christie arrives as a spokesperson from a small British town whose people stand to suffer from a factory the industrialist wishes to build.
429;Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin are good.
430;Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin are good.
431;It's a great movie, but I can't watch the one that I recieved.
432;It's still a great movie, but for those of you not living in """"region 2"""" it won't do you any good."""
