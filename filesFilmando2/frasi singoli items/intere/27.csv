1;"that being said
2;In my opinion it is far superior to Kubrick's rendition of the shining any day.
3;Having seen the snippets of Jack Nicholson's skillful performance, I partly dismissed the movie.
4;the film seemed a novelty, something entertaining in a way it wasn't intended.
5;Between Stanley Kubrick's amazing direction and Nicholson's and Shelly Duvall's excellent performances, first impressions can be misleading.
6;Watching `The Shining' is a real treat.
7;most people are familiar with either the film or the Stephen King book or both, so I'll be brief about the plot: Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former Vermont school teacher, transitioning as a novelist.
8;A visionary of sorts, his other personality picks up on future ominous events, making the boy dread their new venture.
9;both the story and Kubrick's masterful direction make 'The Shining' a horror classic.
10;From the start we get vertiginous mountain views and all of the visions seep into our unconscious core, making the deep winter mountain adventure chilling indeed.
11;Whether from the point of view of boy on a Big Wheel or in an outdoor labyrinthine evergreen maze, the suspense of danger around every corner is palpable.
12;despite this minor objection, `The Shining' is a thriller.
13;The aftermath of my latent viewing is awe for Nicholson's creepy performance as the slowly transforming Jack, and Duvall's portrayal of growing terror is unnerving and frames Nicholson's performance perfectly.
14;Like Linda Blair before him, Danny Lloyd is perfectly believable as the little boy.
15;Being a fan of """"The Shining"""" I was impressed with the clarity of the detail and the sound."""
16;I felt I was watching it at the movie but with the comfort and the privacy of my home.
17;Whether you have seen this movie or not it is really worth your money.
18;And the price is priceless.
19;Stanley Kubrick is a genius.
20;But this is a good movie nonetheless.
21;I was surprised to read that Stephen King did not like the adaptation.
22;Of all his movies that were adapted, I think it was one of the best.
23;it was directed by the greatest film maker ever,stanley kubrik.
24;it starred the greatest actor ever,jack nicholson.
25;jacks a writer and so he thinks the quiet will be good.
26;jack nicholson stars in it.
27;it was classic!the director is the best one ever,stanley kubrik who made such classic films as,2001:a space oddysey,a clockwork orange,full metal jacket and eyes wide shut.
28;it was hilarious!its a classic!id say kubriks 3rd best film and the 12th best film ever made!the best horror film ever so therefore the best stephen king movie also.
29;any true film lover will love this one.
30;this is a bit emotional.
31;jack nicholson gave his best performance ever here.
32;although one flew over the cuckoos nest is neck and neck for his best acting.
33;is it as good as the hype?no.
34;its a long one but worth every minute.
35;Wonderful film, Nicholson most assuredly owns his role in this film like no other.
36;Jack Nicholson is again his best.
37;This classic remains a sensational, psychological thriller over 25 years later.
38;The story remains the same but now it comes in fantastic high definition.
39;Although it's Kubricks vision that makes this movie so enjoyable.
40;set in beautiful Colorado the story is dark in a bright environment.
41;This friend tells Danny things that seem to exhibit a special ability.
42;Jack's wife Wendy just seems to want everything to go right in their lives.
43;most of the acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are still scary at times.
44;Even though movies have become more action packed and fast paced The Shining still shines.
45;The picture is better and the price is right.
46;For people who want to add a wonderful classic to their Blu.
47;Watching this as an adult I found the movie to be absolutely entrancing.
48;But despite knowing pretty much what was going to happen, there were still a number of unpredictable surprises.
49;It's a great movie with a classic performance by Jack Nicholas.
50;If you want to be entertained by a classy thriller, see The Shining.
51;i read the Stephen King novel twice before I finally got to see this movie at a late night showing in Southend, Essex(UK)in the 80's.
52;'The Shining' has influenced me throughout my life.
53;I took my film club buddies to a special screening of `The Shining' at the REX Cinema in Berkhamsted, a beautiful red and gold art deco cinema, unmatched by any other venue here in the UK.
54;The atmosphere of The Rex was perfect to see `The Shining'.
55;The icing on the cake, which was unexpected, was that Kubrick's daughter introduced the film.
56;It was a dream come true to see this film for the second time on the big screen.
57;Wayne's totally right, the film is an experience and one that I've cherished.
58;i remember when I was at drama school we had to be a famous person for a day and I chose to be Jack Nicholson.
59;Great memories!The film had an ongoing impact with me, 'Jack Torrence' would be the part I was born to play, but damn, Stanley made it when I was too young to play a recovering alcoholic father.
60;my friend Guy has an actual framed print from the film which is very cool, I have a Blu .
61;The making of `The Shining' by Kubrick's daughter is enlightening, especially about Kubrick's demands on Shelley.
62;"Kubrick's obsession with attention to detail is crazy or genius
63;You could research so much about this film online, it really is that interesting.
64;I hope this film holds it's value in the future, it's so unique.
65;i'll leave you with this thought"
66;a Jack Nicholson lookalike (one that can act of course) comes after you.
67;Kubrick's art of using that shrill violin to set you on edge was great .
68;The Shining starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall is a solid horror film from start to finish.
69;Stanley Kubrick directed this film and the movie is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name.
70;Parts of this film who definitely freak you out, I highly recommend purchashing this '80s classic, enjoy!
71;"one can see that this is more than a regular ""horror flick."""
72;Third, the film is about the illusion of middle.
73;Because people generally accept well.
74;presented things uncritically (e. g., a visually flawless movie), it is imperative that incidents like Kubrick's depiction of gayness in The Shining be viewed and spoken about with critical eyes.
75;other than that, The Shining is one of the best filmed and acted movies in the history of moviemaking (e. g, the Steadicam scenes, the meticulous camera shots, Nicholson's snarls and facial expressions, etc.).
76;While many aspects of the Stephen King novel were changed, Kubrick captures the terror and fear of madness mixed with resident evil.
77;This movie is worth seeing just for the incredible photography and haunting music (with its basis a Gregorian chant for the dead), to say nothing of Jack Nicholson's over.
78;top acting and a superb supporting cast.
79;here's johnny is the best
80;Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King make the perfect couple in this instant classic.
81;Jack Nicholson's mesmerizing performance didn't hurt either.
82;At 13 there were some parts of the plot I couldn't grasp at the time, but even then I knew a great movie when I saw it.
83;The inside shots were filmed in England I believe.
84;Kubrick and the writers use so many great suble tools to make the movie effective.
85;The characters are interesting enough.
86;Still, the Jack we see for the first half of the movie is a steady person.
87;the Shining reminds me of The Ring in some aspects as it uses quick but powerful images to direct the movie.
88;Therefore it is definately worth owning.
89;Now as an adult i can appreciate how great the movie is.
90;From the director to the actors its one of the master pieces of cinema and one of the most freaky and scary movies ever.
91;It's really a good movie and I see why everybody still loves it years after it was made.
92;I'd recommend it to anyone.
93;The product came fast and in excellent condition.
94;The Shining, based on Steven King's novel is a masterpiece!
95;This movie had some but since the movie was very interesting, I was still able to watch.
96;i thought that the movie was very well done.
97;Jack Nicholson's acting was very good and it seems that he is the one that really fits to the character.
98;The special features is also interesting, featuring the making of The Shining.
99;The music is very haunting and the scenery is good.
100;This film uses such imagary and atmosphere it's quite an intense experience to watch and so it has to go down as one of THE great films love or hate the story.
101;The direction is so utterly unsettling it will have you on the edge of your seat and leave you cold at the end, the true elements of any horror film.
102;this atmospheric thriller is sure to creep you out with its pacing, eery editing and cinematography (those tracking shots are highly effective), and Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as Jack Torrance.
103;It's a gripping and satisfying film experience, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the '80s.
104;release is definitely the version to get.
105;In the way of extras, there is an engaging half.
106;It provides a candid experience of the film's creation, and interviews with some of the actors.
107;There's also the spooky trailer, which shows how a movie preview can perfectly pique one's interest in a film, without spoiling (or even saying) much.
108;This movie has very little to do with the book, but it is very good.
109;Tight suspense and great use of scoring to keep you rattled.
110;Years later I watched it again and loved the movie.
111;The way I see it is like this, the book was incredible, the movie is incredible, they are two seperate things and should be viewed as such.
112;Nicholson and Duval were both perfect and horrible casting at the same time.
113;Because of this, the first half of the movie is a bit hard to swallow, once she reads what Jack's been writing however, the casting is perfect.
114;as for this new edition included are two new documentaries about the movie with interviews with crew from the film as well as Jack Nicholson and others who are fans of the film (Steven Spielberg for instance).
115;The docs are interesting to watch and learn about some of the behind the scenes stuff.
116;There is also a piece with Wendy Carlos who did the music for the film.
117;If you can find a copy somewhere, give it a spin sitting alone in your house at night!
118;a nice upgrade from previous editions of the film.
119;It it a bit slow leading up to the climax, but man Jack Nicholson is worth it!!!
120;He is by far one of the scariest characters yet!!
121;I read The Shining several months ago and found it to be very gripping.
122;Though there is not much action to speak of, if you sit back and really watch the movie and understand the characters it gives you a look into the human mind and how easily it's corrupted.
123;Jack Nicholson was, in my opinion, perfect for this role.
124;He captured every essence of Jack Torrence from the book.
125;That's, good people, what I'll tell you.
126;Do you like horror movies, visual art, a good romp through psychological waters with a comedic twist?
127;"For a first time viewing during the beginning you may find yourself going, ""What the."
128;You will love getting scared to this.
129;The characters show tons of emotion and you have to wonder how it looks so real.
130;It's just right for a horror flick, that's all, and the scenes stick in your mind.
131;So in conclusion why should you watch it.
132;Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's better than Psycho.
133;it really shows a lot of truth in situations.
134;Watch with a friend and you WILL start to talk about it.
135;I am a huge fan of this movie.
136;Mind blowing cinematography created by a true genius.
137;He's still being his Scary self.
138;And one of the best scenes is when the ghost start up Jacks drinking problem again, now I always loved this scene.
139;i was born to be scary.
140;I remember reading the Stephen King book in the 70s.
141;Jack Nicholson is good in this type of role as usual.
142;The extra features are excellent!
143;My fiance surprised me with it right before Halloween.
144;This is a classic and a must for every King fan.
145;Awesome film and worth having to add to my Stephen King Collection as it is a great Classic Horror film.
146;Creepy, funny and fantastic scenery .
147;Jack Nicholson is perfect in this role.
148;The blu ray really made the opening scenes amazing.
149;It's a classic and perfect for Halloween.
150;It is what got me into Stephen King.
151;Whatever he did, however, the film is an effective and suspenseful piece of existential horror.
152;"The film ""shines"" mostly in Jack Nicholson's frenzied and passionate acting and in Kubrick's cinematography of the hotel
153;Those of us who write probably all at least thought the same words that Jack recites here, in one of the memorable lines of hte film: .
154;You know one way you can tell that this is a great movie?
155;It's been popular consistently for over two decades.
156;it's tough to make a great horror movie.
157;One had something to do with singing plants and the other was probably about a prom and mostly likely took place at night.
158;There is a plot and they spend time building up to the insanity, so that you get drawn into the characters and actually care what happens to them.
159;The actors, the music, the directing.
160;Everything comes together in this movie.
161;The Stanley Kubrick film, The Shining, was released on May 23, 1980.
162;the Shining Code is a FREE one.
163;The full uncut film is being released.
164;com, a good website for release info has more details.
165;But, being a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I can see something special about this movie that makes me consider this one as the third installment of a so called, by myself, """"trilogy""""."""
166;There is a feeling of a paranormal environment, manifest by the lighting, the sharp contrast of colors white, blue, red and fog in some of the scenes.
167;First off, The Shining is one of the top three or four really great horror films ever made.
168;Kubrick trumps the source material easily.
169;Sure, the Making of the Shining featurette is interesting, very interesting in fact.
170;Plenty have been spoken about this great movie.
171;Amazing to see the entire movie in less than 2 minutes.
172;Stephen Kings writing with Kubricks creativity result in a intense thriller.
173;This is a wonderful film to add to any collection.
174;A lot of times the older movies have kind of a cloudy or dull look, but the images are really deep and rich.
175;it just destroid all that was eerie and poetic in the book.
176;Stanley Kubrick was a genius, for onething.
177;"There are many scenes from the book that are missing (""Stephen King's The Shining"" is a closer adaptation)."
178;But it still follows the basic story about a family who takes care of the Overlook Hotel and confronts ghosts.
179;kubrik's adaptation offers much to think about.
180;The way the scenes are established still makes me wonder if all the hauntings are real, or are part of the character's imaginations.
181;The source of the film's horror stems from a psychological kind of aspect and to me alludes to a greater kind of dark force.
182;The madness of the characters is real, and is very well portrayed (especially by Jack Nicholson).
183;for all its brilliant acting and provocative cinematography, this film captures the sheer horror of Stephen King's original novel and shoves it deep in the human mind.
184;A classic, today's horror movies rely on gore to scare.
185;This movie uses your imagination.
186;I endured just to watch the end.
187;Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are on their way to an isolated hotel in the mountains on Colorado.
188;i found this film to be quite an interesting watch.
189;Although I myself am not really a fan of the horror genre, this film is a classic and it really shows off Stanley Kubrick's skills as a filmmaker.
190;The cinematography and set design alone make this movie simply amazing to watch.
191;Add on top of that Jack Nicholson's almost hypnotic acting starting as a rather typical person slowly descending into madness.
192;overall, I recommend this movie to those interested in horror films or just those wanting to experience the genius of a Kubrick film.
193;There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.
194;Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.
195;`The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.
196;but, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.
197;I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.
198;When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.
199;Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.
200;When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.
201;couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.
202;If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.
203;The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.
204;I admire this, adore this even.
205;Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.
206;This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.
207;This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.
208;What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.
209;"Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself
210;He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.
211;but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.
212;`The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill.
213;when you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film"
214;Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.
215;They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine.
216;chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.
217;As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.
218;Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.
219;Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.
220;i've watched this movie multiple times, in multiple locations, using multiple networks on multiple devices, and the subtitles synch.
221;You can see Jack Nicholson in it the whole way.
222;The film's a masterpiece, a 5.
223;I watched this a year ago and I still hear the haunting voice of Jack Nicholson.
224;The story is a about a family that moves into a hotel during its off season to take care of it and make sure that its safe.
225;and the shining is a combination of all of those , it is a psychological thriller that scares me to death.
226;based on a novel by Stephen King, directed by Stanley Kubrick and with Jack Nicholson( who steals the show).
227;'The Shining' is quite a cinematic experience powered by powerful performances from Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson.
228;The film may not be perfect and leave you wanting for more, but the strong performances really make up for tiny flaws.
229;A really good film for a Friday Night, if you are ready for neat and a genuine thrilling experience.
230;I enjoyed the film very much.
231;The tension mounted at a great pace.
232;The effects were very good.
233;if you haven't seen The Shining before, I recommend the 119 minute version.
234;Stanley Kubrick's landmark film is based on one of Stephen King's best novels.
235;Soon, he and his wife and son are snowed.
236;Soon some ghosts begin to appear.
237;In Kubrick's version, Nicholson's caretaker is pretty much insane from scene 1.
238;the movie is filled with many iconic images, that even if you haven't seen the film, you will probably recognize.
239;The film also has a great score.
240;"good ""documentary"" about the making of the film."
241;The best part of the documentary are the clips of Kubrick absolutely torturing lead actress Shelley Duvall into getting the scene right.
242;It's the type of uncensored, unapologetic look at a director that you wouldn't see today.
243;Brimming with amazing camera effects, terrifying sequences of outright horror, a great score and, as one of the most diabolical characters in cinematic history, a dynamite performance by my favorite actor, the one and only Jack Nicholson.
244;When the family arrives, everything seems fine at first.
245;Danny learns of his special pyschic gift known as the shining, and what he sees are visions of great error.
246;this special edition looks and sounds great, comes with special features and is an absolute must own.
247;very perfectionistic media talent myself, I more so understand Stanley Krubrick's request to have the viewer view the work as he viewed it.
248;I just viewed the new re.
249;release of The Shining, if you are a fan of this movie it's a must own.
250;The picture looks amazing, the colors and contrast are just beautiful.
251;The new aspect ratio looks very sweet.
252;The soundtrack also sounds great.
253;i loved the extra featues as well, lots of insightful interviews intertwined with cleverly re.
254;The commentary was fascinating, it was great learning about the meticulous attention to detail Kubrick used on this film.
255;If you've never seen it before, then now is the time to see it!
256;This was a great movie with a great price.
257;This is pure Kubrick, not Stephen King.
258;Frankly, the whole movie is pure Kubrick and very little Stephen King.
259;And the bright lighting of the movie is just the first departure from the usual scarey movie formula.
260;He is a deeply disturbed man sliding into total madness.
261;His scene where the months without alcohol has put him to the edge of fury until Lloyd serves him his first drink and the drunk's bravado expansive b. s. emerges is classic.
262;"the movie is full of great Kubrick touches: the tracking shot following Danny on his bike with the great sound of the wheels on carpet then floor then carpet then floor
263;It also has typically odd points of humor in the performances and direction.
264;Each film is so unique and goes where others haven't.
265;This was true for The Shining as well.
266;He was a daring and challenging artist, and we will not be able to travel with him to new places any more.
267;Even though Stephen King didn't like it, it's still a great movie.
268;In fact, out of all the King stories made into movies, this has to be one of the best.
269;It's still a fantastic movie and the blu.
270;ray conversion was great as well.
271;The Shining is without a doubt the best Horror movie ever made.
272;Even after 30 years, it still is the best.
273;Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this Steven King classic.
274;Sill one of the best scary movies around"
275;This is a great movie!
276;The smartest thriller I have ever seen.
277;one of my favorite movies of all times!
278;All times classic and everyone needs to see it.
279;I've never read the book, I kept hearing people say how good this movie is (scariest of all time) so I decided to do it the honor by giving it a try since I've been getting into good horror movies recently.
280;The only part I liked was Hal, that scene was pretty cool.
281;one saving grace, Jack's performance.
282;This is my favorite horror movie of all time and essential for any horror fan's collection.
283;"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is a classic horror movie, starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall."
284;however, I readily admit that Jack Nicholson is excellent starring a man slowly descending into madness.
285;The book will always be better, because ones imagination personnalizes the experience.
286;this film is top notch and Nicholson is flawless.
287;Young Danny Lloyd is also superb.
288;Kudos to Kubrick and Danny Lloyd for playing it correctly throughout.
289;my favorite scene is still the one between Jack and Mr. Grady in the bathroom.
290;The tension created is incredible and it's also the point where the audience sees the connection of Jack's character to the hotel.
291;it's a great film with a marvously tight script, superb direction, perfect pacing and terrific ending.
292;I love watching it for all the architectural details and that moment when Jack is completely consumed by the Overlook.
293;These are the best movies without all the gore.
294;The bathroom scene is the scariest.
295;It's brilliant, hilarious, disturbing, and intriguing.
296;Yes, Kubrik strayed a great deal from King's novel but you know what.
297;he improved it in my opinion.
298;many fans and critics will agree that Kubrick's 2001 is a masterpiece of science.
299;In Kubrick's defense, the images look wonderful.
300;Kubrick had a great eye for what he wanted to paint on the screen.
301;He was so careful and meticulous that every scene looks right.
302;The scenes are clear, uncluttered, and exactly what he wanted.
303;And of course the Nicholson performance is great, as we have come to expect.
304;Kubrick's choices of music are creepy and set just the right mood.
305;Jack has it all in his movies he can play a number of good roles, but in this movie he plays a role no one has played before!
306;This movie is one of my all time favorites and would have gotten 5 stars if a WIDESCREEN version was available.
307;And Jack NICHOLSON has been compulsory to exceed himself in this FILM !
308;The best movie ever adapted from King's novel, a timeless masterpiece, great story and really creepy, a must own.
309;One of the best horror films ever.
310;Its a true Stephen king classic and a great horror film
311;this is the first film i can remember seeing.
312;it's one of the best.
313;enjoy the extras on the new release.
314;He gets a job as a caretaker for a large hotel that's closed for winter.
315;He brings his wife and young son along with.
316;The eerie hotel is filled with possessive spirits.
317;The actors are over the top brilliant.
318;He is one of the greatest legends we have.
319;This is one dandy of a teriffic, classic performance.
320;There are a few classic(and often hilarious)lines and scenes here.
321;Nicholson delivers them in a pitch perfect portrayal of a normal guy driven to insanity.
322;Shelley Duvall, as his victimized wife, is very effective as well.
323;Director Stanley Kubrick really filmed this classic very well.
324;Some times, people, what seems like ham and overacting is what's best.
325;All in all, this is a good, well made movie.
326;Now, I have read the book, and it is fantastic.
327;And so is this movie.
328;after all, Stephen King is this century's best author in the horror genre.
329;If you go to the horror film to be shocked, disturbed, and genuinely frightened by the story, The Shining is definitely the film to see.
330;It's nationally rated as one of the top 5 horror films ever produced, and I strongly believe it earns that designation.
331;Of course, reading the book first will make the film version a bit easier to understand, and quite a bit more frightening in the bargain.
332;Well worth the price of admission, either way.
333;I read the book(which was excellent)and thought it would be fun to have a bunch of friends over to watch the movie.
334;Neither one fits the character in the book.
335;Kubrick should have stayed true to the story.
336;One of the best, watched it for the first time with my 13 year old son and he also loved it.
337;I'm an european, et nous n'avons pas la chance d'avoir la version longue, so it was a great pleasure to see it, for the first time at home, with these 25 minutes bonus.
338;Ooh what a scary film!
339;Gritty and intense, it scared the sh*t out of me more than I thought it would!
340;The acting I was most impressed by wasn't in fact Nicholson and his eyebrow's (although the two of them were great), it was the little boy Danny Lloyd.
341;For any child, heck any actor, it was a great performance, but for a six year old!
342;Such concentration and depth in the eyes, all ready to begin going beserka mental at any moment!
343;shelley Duvall's hysteria and crying was also an impressive accomplishment for an actor, although her character did start to piss me off at one point during the film.
344;But anyway, the ending is intense with lots of people running around panicking and wielding axes, and the final shot will make you think about it long afterwards.
345;A triumph for all those invovled.
346;I received it before the date and the product is in great condition.
347;Rate as high as I can!
348;Powerful acting from top level stars.
349;Great to see all these amazing reviews.
350;What is so interesting is that the film has lasted the test of time.
351;The movie has surpassed pulp art in every way, due to the incredible genius of Stanley Kubrick.
352;This scary movie is not your typical one, but its interesting and compelling all the same.
353;breaking, over the top performances but Danny Llyod and Scatman Crothers give two great performances here.

355;time great horror films, and excellence in several general areas makes it transcend its genre.
356;It is not director Stanley Kubrick's best or most ambitious film but is another jewel in his unparalleled crown"
357;in the best sense of course.
358;Few films get the pulse racing quicker and keep it beating as fast.
359;most remarkable of all is that it does all this with almost no traditional horror trappings.
360;"Kubrick showed in 2001: A Space Odyssey that what we do not see is often more powerful than what we do
361;As in the past, Kubrick also uses music very effectively.
362;Nearly all horror films try, but very few are as successful"
363;"the cinematography is also incredible
364;faultless, and several shots .
365;The famous blood flow sequence is even better"
366;Similarly great is the segue from Jack looking at the maze model to his family walking in the actual maze .

368;"Lighting is also excellent
369;realism and strong supernatural overtones was daring and highly influential.
370;This is a film that truly rewards close and multiple viewings.
371;as for the acting, it is of course top.
372;Jack Nicholson's signature performance is one of the greatest ever.
373;Though frightening in the best sense, it is also screamingly funny"
374;old Danny Lloyd also deserves great praise.
375;His is one of the toughest and best child acting jobs of all.

377;For example, like Joseph Conrad's classic story """"Heart of Darkness,"""" it shows ."""
378;It is in danger of coming out at any time and certainly will with the right stimuli.
379;all told, The Shining is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in horror, Nicholson, Kubrick, or King and is indeed so generally excellent that anyone looking for a supremely suspenseful and entertaining film should check it out.
380;In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set.
381;This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best!
382;Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie.
383;I loved King's novel and have read it many times.
384;I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits.
385;So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece.
386;Jack Nicholes was he perfect person to be for this role.
387;He had a great attitude and a great role, he made it look like he was really changing his peraonally i have seen this movie over 200 times in a year its the best.
388;Jack Nicholson is fantastic and plays the best crazy person ever!
389;If you have never seen this flick, it is a classic.
390;The Shining~ Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite movies of all time.
391;Nicholson is amazing in the role as Jack Torrence and Duvall is not bad as his meek and sweet wife Wendy Torrence.
392;The suspense and the psychological effects are harrowing and Jacks descent into madness is truly frightening.
393;The movie is so much better then the book and Kubrick has turned a fairly mediocre book into one of the best horrror movies of all time.
394;Danny Lloyd was amazing in his one and only role and it is truly strange that he did not star in any more movies.
395;This is one of the best horrror movies of all time and like I mentioned earlier Nicholson does a stunning job with the role.
396;He should have won an academy award for the part since it is truly astounding.
397;For how could the master spellbinder have issues about one the greatest horror films ever to come out of tinseltown?
398;As far as the actors are concerned the casting is flawless.
399;Nicholson is a bit over the top, but this is a horror film we're talking about.
400;Shelley Duvall is spectacular, but I got the sense that Kubrick hired her to get the audience to root for the Nicholson's devilish persona.
401;minded that its true wonder that she stays alive at all.
402;He is a man who has known no boundaries in his filmmaking as he has pushed the corners of creativity and the intensity of the imagination to expand into a cold, unrelenting study in what will disturb us indefinately.
403;Insofar as this review is concerned, this is a must see movie.
404;Watch it more than once and take in one of King's finest stories and one Kubrick's most haunting interpretations.
405;This may also be one of the only times you will be able to say in confidence that the movie is just as good if not better than the novel that inspired it.
406;This film is allegedly based on a good Stephen King story, and some people think it was influenced by Resnais' immaculate masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad.
407;way decent person, got axed suddenly.
408;"bright colours and mainly with massive lighting
409;You still have to admire the way Stan the man won a reputation as one of the 20th century's greatest film.
410;This of course is an older movie but still one of Nicholsons best.
411;this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.
412;`The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the novel by Stephen King may be one of Kubrick's best movies, and may be the second best rendition of a Stephen King novel on film (next to `Carrie') and yet I understand Herr King has little respect for this film interpretation of his work.
413;I do confess that the TV miniseries based on `The Stand', arguably King's best novel, was decent, but I think that was only good, not great.
414;i always feel a very personal connection to this movie, as it's announcement was the reason I started reading Stephen King novels.
415;on Kubrick's part, his adaptation of the story overall is good and his blocking and cinematography is superb, but we would expect nothing less from Kubrick.
416;so, in the end, I have to give Kubrick high marks for succeeding where only George Romero has done well, out of all the King cinematic attempts, including some done by King himself.
417;me and i feel in love with the whole plot and i love how jack does the slow transformation from a normal person to a nut case if you like horror and scary stuff you have to see this movie (.)
418;I have loved this, movie since it was first released.
419;Jack Nicholson was great at acting as a nutcase.
420;Some parts of the movie were hilarious.
421;best reviewed movie of its genre.
422;Let's just say the movie itself is great.
423;Having said that, I decided to pick up The Shining, mainly because I love the movie and the only other copy I own is the VHS tape.
424;the picture is stunningly crisp and detailed.
425;The flesh tones are even and consistent and they've really shaken that washed.
426;I felt like I was """"inside"""" the Overlook Hotel, and this makes the experience of the film all the more unsettling and terrifying."""
427;there is definitely a bit of noticeable grain here and there.
428;def experience of watching one of the most psychologically disturbing movies of all time.
429;Any movie that could do something like this to me must be great!
430;I have since watched it again, and am astounded by the film's tension, general atmosphere of unease, and I have come to greatly admire the fine acting of all the principals.
431;Kubrick's Overlook Hotel is one of the great sets in the history of filmmaking.
432;The photography, camera work, and compositions are all spectacular, and the film gains greatly from a truly exquisite use of music (a soundtrack was released very briefly, but it is long out of print).
433;This film has the simple yet compelling structure of a fairy tale, and some of its images have become mythic in themselves .
434;This is a very great film that richly rewards repeated viewing .
435;it is my personal favorite of Kubrick's after 2001.
436;I have watched this movie four more times since then though, and loved it every time!
437;It is one of my favorite subjects to talk about with my dad!
438;I bought the book and love all of the stuff and detail in it that was not in the movie like the hedge animals.
439;Also, Bill Watson made roll on the floor with laughter in the book because of his dirty talking humor about the woman in the tubs history when she was at the hotel and her grandson!
440;He uses the F word almost constantly!
441;As for acting, VERY good!
442;Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King are brilliant in entirely seperate ways.
443;The novel is good and even though Kubrick changed a lot of things, I must say that the movie is equally good.
444;She got the hysterics of Wendy down well enough, but I think an actress closer to the one in the book would have been better.
445;I have always loved watching this movie.
446;Now that I bought it I can watch it anytime I want and I will
447;The real villian is the OVERLOOK.
448;The use of the steadicam is amazing as it glides through the magnificent hallways and lounge.
449;Music by Wendy Carlos is very effective.
450;(I swear that during the maze chase at the end they used music from 2001!
451;listen and you will see what I mean).
452;Very interesting movie, although I can't say that I would watch it very often.

454;The Shining is a wonderful story about Danny Torrance, a lovable little boy, and his family who are trapped in a haunted hotel for the winter.
455;face with a motley crew of hilarious and mischievous ghosts.
456;This is simply the best horror film ever made!
457;It really is that good.
458;Jack Nicholson's acting is amazing!
459;A must see and have movie!
460;Highly recomment watching this movie and keep in your collection.
461;Very well filmed and directed by Kubrick.
462;This is an awsome journey into horror and suspense.
463;the 30 min extra doco is very enjoyable and well produced and informative.
464;I know this is often considered one of the scariest movies of all time, and I will admit that it has its moments, but good grief, I've never seen a horror film that is so slow to build up to anything remotely scary.
465;, until he finally had to start acting insane, and then I thought he was brilliant.
466;A perfectly cast Shelly Duvall as the mousey, abused wife who would aid anyone's spiral further down into the abyss of insanity.3.
467;Some pretty chilling acting from a terrific little 6.
468;Scenes of disturbing images that pulsate throughout the film, and manage to stay with you long after the movie is over.5.
469;The movie is as perfect as it could have been and tells the story amazingly.
470;It is a long movie and worth the trip all the way.
471;Frightening as hell and perfect in that regard.
472;But it is a film I do re.
473;watch from time to time simply because visually, like most of Kubrick's films, it is so satisfying and the Blu.
474;ray disc does bring out the technical achievements of the movie.
475;The cinematography is excellent as one would expect, but the frequent use of the Steadicam, being used here by Kubrick for the first time, does begin to call attention to itself.
476;ray release is impressive in its clarity, color balance and freedom from graininess and the helicopter blades are nowhere to be seen.
477;And if it's Kubrick you want, watch any of his other films, almost all of which are terrific.
478;But The Shining comes very, very close.
479;reading the reviews here is a clue to what makes The Shining so special.
480;Not only a great horror film, The Shining is one of my favorite movies of all time.
481;Jack Nicholson's acting was terrifyingly superb, not to mention the faces that Shelley Duvall made.
482;Kubrick did a great job of directing as well.
483;My wife told me we'd love it.
484;And it had its moments.
485;I can watch a Hitchcock film and enjoy it as much as I did back in the day.
486;In that case, it is perfect.
487;Even though it strays pretty far from the novel, it packs a punch because that is what Kubrick did best, make engrossing films!
488;Director Stanley Kubrick took Stephen King's novel and adapted it to the big screen.
489;This movie has great writing, directing, cinematography and acting (Jack Nicolson).
490;This is definitely one to add to your collection.
491;The film is a bit dated, but enjoyable none the less.
492;I'd never really seen a horror movie before this, and this was a lot of fun to watch on Halloween.
493;It has excellent foreshadowing and the conclusion is great, but at times the scariest part about it is the music.
494;"I was initially surprised as to the variety of elements the film contains
495;This is a great movie and a great introduction to the horror genre.
496;The Shining is one of the horror genre's most notable films.
497;Made in 1980 by the late, legendary Stanley Kubrick, the film stands out as not only one of his best but probably the best Stephen King adaptation as well.
498;Kubrick was a genius behind the camera, giving us long, beautiful shots, allowing us to take in both the beauty and the horror of the Overlook Hotel.
499;Black levels are deep, clean, and ungrainy and the majority of the film offers a surprisingly clean look.
500;whether you're a long time fan of the film, or new to it, this is a must.
501;I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
502;this is the real shining of Kubrick.
503;The cinematography is fantastic, especially many of the outdoor scenes in the mountains in Colorado"
504;It still looked amazing wherever it was.
505;But there is some really good dark humor here.
506;My favorite: the Jack Nicholson character is arguing with the wife character, and he says something like, I had a dream.
507;I dreamed that I killed you and Danny.
508;Now, a line like this must have the correct delivery.
509;And Mr. Nicholson's delivery is perfect.
510;This is true with the child character, and this is true with the Nicholson character.
511;one issue that I did have: early in the film, when the child character seems to have imaginary friends, a female psychiatrist character is introduced that interviews him.
512;a pretty big recommendation here by me, even for a second or third look.
513;Stephen King is,and always has been,my hero!
514;This version of THE SHINING is still,IMO,the best.
515;It stands up today, 25 years later.
516;Many of his books just don't translate to film,but I highly recommend THE SHINING.
517;right up there with THE DEAD ZONE (my favorite SK.
518;The mind bending thriller of a movie takes you to the Stanley Hotel and leaves you there stunned!
519;Jack Nicholson is awesome in this movie.
520;"He has a lot of good movies, We think it one of his best, especially when he says ""Here's Johnny"""
521;crafted film that still delivers.
522;The acting and setting combine to tell a scary tale of a haunting set in a classic marital power struggle.
523;And it's one of the best horror films of all time, given how well it's stood the test of time, it still has the power to deliver the kind of stunning, knock out awe, that punches the viewer back into themselves, trying to find a place to hide from the mayhem.
524;"It's one of my (two) favorite Jack Nicholson films
525;This film is a rare exception, and probably would fall into my top 100 films.
526;The Shining is one of the scariest best films ever made.
527;It is best to view it as a seperate entity from the book.
528;The Shining is great for its arresting images, Nicholson's over the top performance, the creepiness of the two girls.
529;Though Danny's shine can be at times laughable and silly and the ending is pretty bad, this film is really worth seeing for the performances and cinematography alone.
530;As always it was a great movie this movie was watch by my grandson he is watching all the great old movies to keep him busy over the summer!!
531;Anyone who has ever read the book knows that this movie is based on someting other then the king novel.
532;It is one of the best I have ever read and more scary then the movie(which actually isn't)
533;I read Stephen Kings the Shining when I was 9 years old and the book frightened me, I could see in my minds eye the Overlook Hotel, its starkness in the winter, the isolation that the family had to endure, I always loved how King could take buildings and breathe into them a misty haunted frightening humanity of some kind.
534;Still gives me the willies!
535;Definitely one of my top ten movie favorites.
536;But the movie is entertaining, but the movie was better.
537;the book is great, the movie is good.
538;The acting is good in the movie, Stanley Kubrick is a good director, and a good story, but is not as good as the book.
539;It arrived new and sealed :) I am very pleased with this product.
540;I love creepy, I love Jack Nicholson.
541;Worth the time spent to watch at least once I'd think.
542;Other than that, this is a classic film.
543;I will see the remake next.
544;Background music is well set and makes it even more scary.
545;It is a movie that you can watch again and again !
546;can,t beat a good jack Nicholson movie.
547;I believe yall should issue a credit.
548;I watched this movie as it came highly recommended as a classic, and there was an opportunity to see Room 237 in theater the next day.
549;The main storyline, albeit slow at first, is quite compelling.
550;There are multiple layers within the movie.
551;that make it worth watching again and again.
552;Classic performance from Jack Nicholson.
553;I'll disect this film as brief as possible.
554;Also if you enjoy watching movies that got lots and lots of blood.
555;I did enjoy finally seeing it this way.
556;Especially that of Shelley Duvall, who plays Jack Nicholson's wife in the movie.
557;Not exactly like the book but still entertaining.
558;Simply brilliant, The Shining is frightening and true enough to the novel to be appreciated in the sense that it is an adaptation of a true master, King.
559;Great acting and scary scenes.
560;His facial expressions are the best.
561;Still the scariest movie ever.
562;Jack Nicholson was brilliant in this movie!
563;I absolutely would recommend people to watch this movie!
564;demand"""" so my son and daughter (now that they are old enough) could see this with us."""
565;"jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall put in great performances as ""Jack"" and ""Wendy"", respectively, and young Danny Lloyd plays a very creepy Danny\Tony."
566;Like many King stories, the location and history (both explained very early) of the hotel are key plot elements.
567;Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly going insane is truly brilliant and some of the lines are very memorable.
568;many of the scenes are often spoofed on popular modern shows, which is why we wanted our teens to see it.
569;even with all of that, this is still a fantastic movie that has become part of our popular culture.
570;He is one of my all time favorite actors and Stephen King is one of my all time favorite authors.
571;I bought it when it came out on vhs and pretty much wore it out.
572;For The Shining it'd be the book even though Kubrick's masterpiece is my favorite Kubrick film.
573;It's a standout horror film in its own light.
574;Nicholson's performance is over the top as the crazed lead.
575;in my opinion, jack really made this movie what it is by his all so believable performance.
576;Taking the glacial beauty of the ultra.
577;"aesthetic ""Barry Lyndon"" and revving it up with free."
578;We might well declare, with Nicholson's Jack Torrance, that we know what's going to be behind every corner.
579;The Vermeeresque lighting provides an uncanny backdrop for the spectral goings.
580;"on
581;And yet it is one of the most compulsively viewable films in cinematic history.
582;It is a gorgeous, intoxicating and obliterating nightmare from which a generation has yet to awake.
583;The Shining is one of my favorite movies and is especially enjoyable late at night in the dark because of its isolated setting and Jack Nicholson's increasing mania.
584;It is a must see for anyone who is a fan of either Kubrick or Nicholson (his finest performance other than in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ).
585;Great classic, Kubrick as always delivers a masterpiece that tells us a story on multiple levels.
586;Kubrick not only gives us a compelling drama with stellar cinematography, acting and visuals, his films also unveil major conspiracies and spiritual truths.
587;The Shining is chilling, it's a subtle movie, at least by today's standards, it is brilliant on levels Hollywood has seems to have forgotten.
588;The absolutely fantastic cinematography and camera direction.
589;All of these are perfect in their effectiveness.
590;jack Nicholson's performance is flawless and and every bit as riveting as the cinematography, I can't imagine how they could have found anyone more perfect for the part.
591;Danny Lloyd also does a terrific job, especially when his imaginary friend comes out to play.
592;Shelley Duvall's acting on the other end was fine but did stick out as the weakest part of the movie, but it gets the job done.
593;of course, all this wouldn't be worth a thing of the story hadn't been so well written, Steven King obviously providing great source material while Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson's adaptation bringing the novel alive in cinema.
594;All of this a testament to Kubrick's skill as a director.
595;Brilliantly realized film with great performances and gorgeous visuals.
596;This film satisfies and rewards the viewer anytime it is watched.
597;Think everyone has seen this one!
598;A true classic, the music, the filming, everything is superb.
599;Really a truly frightening movie.
600;This movie is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie.
601;This is one of my favorite horror/suspense movies of all time.
602;Jack Nicholson's antics always amaze me and I never seem to tire of them.
603;when an alcoholic on the wagon agrees to isolate himself and his family by taking a winter caretaker position at a large Colorado hotel, it seems like the perfect job, especially for an aspiring writer who hopes to finish his novel.
604;This movie will still keep viewers on their toes, despite having been filmed in the eighties when many advances in special effects hadn't been made.
605;this statment by one of few true masters in the art of film is a flawed masterpiece of black humor.
606;Stanley Kubrick is such an amazing director!
607;The story is perfectly set up to draw you into the sense of isolation and insanity.
608;Amazing performances and groundbreaking cinematography make this one of the all time greatest Horror films ever made.
609;The immediate playback was awesome!
610;True horror is subtle and realistic.
611;In The Shining, Kubrick offers us a ride into madness and hysteria, scaring us with both the real and surreal.
612;Ones of Steven Kings best.
613;This film I really like.
614;Add this one to your Steven King collection today.
615;The Shining is perhaps one of the greatest horror films ever made.
616;Like Jack Torrance, its writer, director and creator Stanley Kubrick had an obsession.
617;Kubrick was one of Hollywood's finest director but he believed everything, including the slightest detail had to be perfect.
618;Kubrick loved Stephen King's novel but felt that it had flaws so he decided with his writing parter that he would take the concept and characters of Jack Torrance and his wonderful adventure in the old Overlook Hotel and create a more eerie and sadistic story.
619;king allowed Kubrick to take his novel and create a movie out of it, giving it a physical life.
620;Although King loved Kubrick's envision of The Shining, he was upset of how Kubrick changed some of the roles of characters and the storyline.
621;clearly when you watch a Nicholson film, you can see right from the start that he is a truly gifted actor, superior to most of the crap that is portrayed today.
622;Nicholson is able to pull off various roles.
623;He excels in the crazy, psychopath role which is what Jack Torrance later turns out to be.
624;The premise of the Shining is to have a strong believable Jack Torrance, you need, the movie cannot survive without a powerful performance.
625;Nicholson was the perfect fit for this film.
626;He knew, the cast and crew knew it and Kubrick knew it.
627;kubrick's envision of King's novel is a masterpiece.
628;The movie should have been nominated for best film, best director, best actor and best actress.
629;He made the cast and crew earn their paychecks.
630;Thats why his role in this film is so powerful, because it was real.
631;the Shining is a movie that leaves you guessing because you don't really know for sure whether or not there are supernatural beings living within the Hotel because whatever so called """"ghosts"""" you see are either an imagination of the young and gifted child of Danny or the crazy father Jack."""
632;Kubrick does not want to give it away to his audience and like Hitchcock, he leaves you guessing.
633;shelley Duvall, although not a pretty actress to look at, is the perfect choice for the role of Wendy, Jack's concerned wife.
634;She makes sure the boiler is running she knows the kitchen well, she makes minor adjustments to the hotel while Jack is typing away gibberish on his typewriter.
635;She also stirs Jack's emotions and causes him to go deeper into his isolation which causes him to crave alcohol and later go insane.
636;She looks after the family, especially her little boy Danny.
637;She is the heroine of the film.
638;Duvall plays a powerful and convincing role.
639;She makes up for her appearance by acting as Nicholson's foil and you can tell right from the start, there is a good chemistry between the two characters.
640;They portray the average American family because not all couples look like Angelina and Brad, so therefore it is more realistic because people can relate to the characters.
641;Her body language and accent is perfect for the film because at first you get the impression that she is this dumb senseless brunette but she later evolves, showing her true colors and you understand who wears the pants in the family the same way Hilary Clinton dominates her marriage with Bill.
642;She proved to be Kubrick's perfect choice because he was not looking at her face or breasts when he chose her, he was looking into her soul.
643;The Shining was an exception because this truly is a remarkable film.
644;Its brilliantly acted and directed and the scenery for the time was remarkable.
645;This was one of Nicholson's finest performances and probably Shelley Duvall's best.
646;This is a fantastic film, if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself.
647;All I can say is WOW!
648;What an incredible performance by Jack !
649;Shelley Duvall was great as that passive wife who would probably begin to grate on any husband over time and little Danny Lloyd was both adorable and SCARY!
650;I was VERY pleasantly surprised to see Scatman Crothers as a pivotal character in this film!
651;Overall, a great actors, great cinematography, great story and a GREAT film from Kubrick!
652;Twists and turns constantly keep you guessing what Jack will do next!
653;I got it and it delivers.
654;It's a fascinating reflection on acting, on moviemaking, on personalities, and it really blew me away.
655;You get insight into Nicholson, his rehearsal process and his performance, the tension involving Shelley Duvall, and a strange interview with Scatman Crothers who is really, really (really) happy to be involved with the production.
656;but mostly, you get to see and hear Stanley Kubrick in action.
657;He is, of course, the man.
658;For those of you who haven't watched The Shining, and are thinking about getting it, I highly recommend that you do.
659;There is not a horror film that could be as great as the Shining, or will there ever be one as great as The Shining.
660;Reallynothing!For there are close to 700 reviews forthis HORROR masterpiece.
661;i was lucky to see this onthe big screen.
662;And to tell the truthI liked it.
663;i really wanted to point that out for I haveread alot of the reviews for this and they all touch thingslike the brilliant directing,to the superb acting,to evan theelaborate hotel.
664;Has Jack always beenin the black and white pic.
665;Can you please comment and fillme in on this.
666;Everything that previous reviewers have said about the last release of The Shining is true.
667;It has a brilliant transfer and a 5.1 Dolby audio track.
668;It is a fact that the story has been changed somewhat, but the enjoyment that a person can get out of this film is an enormous amount.
669;Jack Nicholson is pure genius as Jack Torrance and the rest of the cast and crew are also very good.
670;This movie is truly horriyfing, and truly analyzes the transformation from a nice and caring father to a man without a heart stopping at nothing to murder his family and relive the past of the OVERLOOK HOTEL.
671;And Jack starts to find himself changing by the day.
672;But still, love those parodies(All beer and no TV make Homer something something).
673;There's probably at least 15 or so in the entire film.
674;with good performances, memorable scenes and good tracking shots(although really used excessively), it's not the most scariest film ever, it's just a really well.
675;I bought this movie after I saw A Clockwork Orange and I was all about Stanley Kubrick.
676;I showed to my friends and my sisters and everyone agreed with me.
677;the traveling of the child going everywhere with his tricycle.
678;all of these things get you into the movie.
679;Jack Nicholson y Shelley Duvall give great performances (it's beyond reality), as well as the little kid going: REDRUM and writing it with red lipstick in the bathroom door.
680;but the extras are very good.
681;well, the documentary about the movie is pretty interesting.
682;That said, for the casual viewer, The Shining is a singularly unique viewing experience.
683;"The third act is among the most harrowing in the history of cinema
684;new technology of the steadycam is incredibly effective at heightening the tension and surreality of the isolated setting"
685;ray transfer is very crisp, and the sound (always important in a Kubrick film, but especially important in this one) is SUPERB.
686;30 years after I first saw it, The Shining remains one of the definitive American horror films, and the Blu.
687;ray edition is a wonderful representation of the work.
688;The movie itself is great.
689;The director is Stanley Kubrick, the actor is Jack Nicolson.
690;Right there you know is a great movie.
691;The Shining a great, bizaar thriller about insanity, and what is real.
692;But what Jack doesn't know, is his son's supernatural power, the shining.
693;I strongly recommend this to any horror/Nicolson/Kubrick fan.
694;I love Jack Nichelson, and i belive he is the best thing in this movie.
695;Yes, it's totally worth the high def release.
696;as the film begins we're treated to some amazing shots of snow.
697;Jack's eager to get the job (and he does), as it will allow for him to have the time to work on his writing.
698;Jack returns with his family, including wife Wendy (Duvall), and their son Danny (Lloyd), along with Danny's imaginary friend Tony (Danny's got some kind of `special' abilities of an extra sensory sort, which tend to channel through his finger, and he' come to know as Tony).
699;The family settles in, and things seem to be going well enough until Jack begins to develop writer's block along with a touch of the `cabin fever', and a massive snowstorm settles into the area, further isolating the Torrances from the outside world.
700;The film is filled with wonderful shots featuring interesting angles and unique points of view (the shot with Jack in the freezer, leaning against the door talking to Wendy is inspired) that work amazingly well to foster a sense of claustrophobia in a place that's anything but.
701;This role is characterized as a `signature' role for Nicholson (a role he'll always be known as, much like Voight and the character of Joe Buck or Deniro as Travis Bickle), and while the over the top performances by Nicholson are what gets noticed, watch the quieter scenes for some of the most chilling parts as we see his character desperately struggling to maintain his tenuous grip despite the forces piled against him.
702;Duvall does an amazing job here, especially the scenes where she has to react as the situation continually deteriorates.
703;I also thought Danny Lloyd served the film extremely well, helping to create some of the truly shocking and unnerving moments.
704;Other elements that work so well throughout are the eerie music, the beautiful and elegant sets (the interiors were shot on an English soundstage), and the very realistic dialog featuring many memorable lines.
705;that honor would have to go to The Exorcist (1973), but this one is certainly in the top five, and may cause a sleepless night or two.
706;I love the original version of this movie.
707;It is one of my favorites.
708;I was sorely disappointed when I realized they edited out some scenes that were creepy and one to me is very important to the story.
709;I am shocked at how amazing this film looks in Blu.
710;Of all the discs I've watched (including recent titles) this film is the best.
711;If you're a fan of this film, or film in general, this disc is a must.
712;"TRY to watch the opening (credit) sequence and keep telling yourself the obvious thing: ""O. k., he did this with a helicopter and a Steadicam ."
713;and this is the point the film STARTS from!]
714;"[*] For more on karmic ""stuckness,"" please see Thomas Pynchon's ""Vineland"" (1990): ""What an evening."
715;I found it to be very entertaining and very suspenseful film.
716;Those visuals are so good that I didn't mind the slow pace.
717;Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role.
718;"Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her ""Olive Oyl"" face, smile and soft voice."
719;She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair.
720;The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.
721;if you are any kind of a fan of this film, or director Stanley Kubrick's unique style of filmmaking, you owe it to yourself to look at it on this high.
722;You'll be amazed how great it looks.
723;This is by far one of Kubricks best pieces of film direction.
724;Jack Nicholson brings to the screen an unforgetable performance as the possesed psycho who is overcome by the spirits that stay in The Overlook Hotel that he decides to look after with his family over the winter peroid.
725;The original book that the film is adapted from is more complex and carries a lot more detail but Kubrick manages to deal with this problem and condenses the film while still making it enjoyable and make sense.
726;The supporting cast also do a good job and act magnificantly with Nicholson.
727;I never really considered this movie to be a true 'horror' film.
728;the movie is a great experience and one of the best films basing on a King story.
729;the BR offers a wonderful picture and a very good sound.
730;Kubricks visuals are still worth watching and for meThe Shining is an timeless classic.
731;King may not like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, but this is one of the best movies ever made.
732;Thank you for my order!!
733;The plot is believable and unbelievably scary.
734;this movie is twisted and keeps you up nights on end.
735;It introduces new stuff constanly keeping your mind whirrling and wondering.
736;I recommend it for anyone over 13, but only if they're into scary movies.
737;Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.
738;jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.
739;anyway the performances are excellent and so is everything else.
740;Delivered on time, well packed, good condition, I just love this people and the movie too, it is funny and sentimental and have action and mystery too.
741;Jack Nicolson is the perfect crazy man in the movie.
742;Another thing this movie possesed was great cinematography as any Kubrick film posses and great acting by all of the actors and actresses.
743;He took a very good novel by Stephen King, used about ten percent of the actual story, and threw the rest away and made it into a Kubrick movie.
744;He made it very dark, and twisted, took out all of the greatness of the novel, and gave Nicholson an excuse to run around acting as crazy as he possibly could with an axe in his hands.
745;Wendy, Nicholson's wife in the movie, was an excellent character in the book, but in the film, she was just a whimpering, crying idiot.
746;A movie needs good characters, especially a horror movie, and this didn't really get into the characters like the book did.
747;In the story, the two are very close, with an undying love for each other, but in the movie, they're just a guy and his son.
748;Stanley Kubricks interpretation of Steven Kings novel is excellant.
749;the movie took way to long to get to me, but when it did i was very happy with the way it played
750;I like most King movies.
751;This was however, a teriffic story about a man and his family staying in a hotel high up in the Rockies.
752;This film is soooo good you can use it for a Sunday School lesson in which you talk about the young rich ruler who goes to Jesus, and asks what he could do to enter Heaven, and Jesus finally tells him to sell his possessions, and follow him, and the ruler goes away because he didn't want to part with his possessions.
753;I still don't know what this was all about, but Kubrick does a good job of balancing those scenes with the chase scenes through the maze.
754;I feel that this is quite possibly the best film ever made.
755;No problem, as Jack finds the seven months perfect to write his book while his wife Wendy and their son Danny can do other things.
756;the visual imagery is stunning and horrifying.
757;And the Grady twins have got to be among the creepiest movie children I've seen in years.
758;But the design of the hotel itself is a visual feast with its decorations, especially the Gold Room.
759;But the symmetry also represents the state of Jack's mind.
760;and chalk up yet another role that deserved at least a Best Actor nomination for Jack Nicholson.
761;A line from the MAD magazine's satire of this movie, The Shiner, is apropos.
762;And Shelley Duvall adds to the credibility as Wendy.
763;With The Shining, he effectively added psychological horror to his small but potent resume.
764;Great delivery and in perfect condition.
765;Kubrick's best films have always, thematically, had much in common with horror films .
766;"e. g. the mental and physical decline of confident male heroes
767;so it is surprising people found his choice to make 'The Shining' an odd one.
768;and 'Shining' is deeply satisfying on all these levels: it is, for instance, the best metaphor for marriage since Beckett's 'Happy Days', a heightening of a very real situation .
769;the film can also be seen as an allegory for America's past, the spirits of African slaves and massacred Indians come back to haunt a nation on the brink of the Reagan years.
770;the film's opening, with its chillingly articulate officials and large lobby hint at a terrifying voyage ahead.
771;like '2001', 'Shining' is unexpectedly, blackly comic, yet also curiously moving .
772;the Gold Room sequences are among the most resonant in all cinema.
773;Scenes that aren't even the slightest bit suspenseful are scored with intense music.
774;Hence the incredibly high ratings this movie gets.
775;its kinda wride and dossint make a lot of sense but i like the line """"hear's johney!"""""""
776;This is worth sending for for the extended version because it makes a brilliant film even better!
777;The Shining was an interesting choice for director Stanley Kubrick to tackle.
778;To my mind, whatever it is or whatever Kubrick intended it to be it works.
779;Duvall also gives a frenzied performance, but legend has it that she was a sensitive soul who cracked under the pressure that Kubrick exerted.
780;The Overlook hotel set also works as a character in the film, with it's long hallways and cavernous rooms used to terrific effect.
781;He so disliked this film that he approved a made.
782;I think this film has held up remarkably well and that Kubrick made the correct choices.
783;top performance that makes this film five stars.
784;Comparing the two, both have their moments and stronger points.
785;The centerpiece of this version is the writer Jack Torrence played by Nicholson and of course, the beautiful Overlook Hotel and its scenary.
786;The most outlandish scene is Jack and Wendy on the stairs with the bat, which is brilliant.
787;I highly recommend all of Kubrick's films, and this is no exception.
788;If you still have a compatible player, it is worth finding this gem if available.
789;It was a great thriller to watch on Halloween night.
790;Jack was great and I really did not expect the outcome of the movie to happen the way it did.
791;Nicholson's performance is way over the top, as is Duvall's, and the soundtrack becomes overwhelming by the end of the film.
792;Director Stanley Kubrick knows how to frame and light a shot so that the desolation and chill of the environment seeps right off the screen.
793;Does not really follow the book but it is still well directed and acted.
794;Jack and Stanley made a good movie.
795;By 1980, we knew that Stanley Kubrick could make movies.
796;He revolutionized the genre with his classics 2001, a clockwork orange, and Barry Lyndon, and The shining is no exception.
797;The first Kubrick I saw, the shining really terrifys.
798;the shining has many scenes that will make you jump.
799;Second is the pure fear the graces shelly Duvall's face, and of course third, Jack's imfamous insane grin.
800;some may find that The shining is slow, but those who can appreciate the way Kubrick makes movie's, will be enthralled by the set's, the camera movements, and the superb acting.
801;Definitely on my list of scarriest movies of all time.
802;"Yet The Shining"" remains one of Kubrick's most popular pictures, the movie most non."
803;kubrick fans enjoy the most.
804;I'm a Kubrick fan, I appreciate his other work, and I love this film, too.
805;Taken for what it is, an extremely well.
806;"made horror flick with a typically ambiguous Kubrick theme about the lingering effects of evil, ""The Shining"" stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
807;"based on the novel by Stephen King, ""The Shining"" tells the story of a former alcoholic (Jack Nicholson) who takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and five.year."
808;"And the young son happens to be psychic, which adds to the dilemma
809;wielding monster, and tearing after his wife and son.
810;The first hour is appropriate introduction and exposition.
811;It builds a mood of quiet tension.
812;It's a beautiful motion picture to look at, whether it's for the glorious outdoor scenery or the equally impressive indoors of the grand hotel.
813;It may be the most good.
814;looking horror movie ever made, and I love those long tracking shots through the hallways.
815;The hotel itself is made to become a dynamic persona in the drama.
816;One sequence shows Kubrick telling Nicholson they will have to re.
817;The upshot, in any case, is a tour.
818;As much as for any of his many fine film roles, it may be for this performance that Nicholson is best remembered.
819;frame photography from which the theatrical widescreen version was later matted.
820;The image is high, wide, and deep, quite a bit more so than I had remembered from its initial widescreen theatrical release.
821;channel sources opened up to five.
822;The results are far from spectacular, and they are still accompanied by some tape hiss and noise, but they are a decided improvement on the previous mono.
823;scenes documentary, """"The Making of the Shining,"""" about thirty."""
824;It was shot by the director's daughter, Vivian Kubrick, much like a home movie during the feature film's production and includes interviews with cast and crew, and a good deal of inside information.
825;Extensive film clips from Kubrick's films and from private sources take us behind the movies and into the soul of the man who made such unique films.
826;Much of the documentary goes over material we already know, but much of it is new and fascinating, too.
827;frightening experience that only proved how taut and well constructed Kubrick's treatment was.
828;I've read King's original novel, and I've seen Kubrick's film several times.
829;read King's original tale, and fell in love with it all over again.
830;Just a creepy, wonderful story.
831;let me state right up front, that I really enjoy this movie.
832;"It's a beautifully shot film
833;I think the biggest problem with this movie, is also it's biggest asset, and that's Jack Nicholson.
834;In the novel Jack Torrance loves Wendy, and he's doing everything he can to save his marriage.
835;what really stood out to me on this viewing was what a wonderful performance Shelley Duvall put in as Wendy.
836;Her character arc his much more compelling, and I think Duvall adds so much to the film, and to the character of Wendy, as it's much better than what King gave to Wendy.
837;danny Lloyd as young Danny Torrance carries a lot of the film on his shoulders, and he is really, really good.
838;Lloyd carries his scenes, and plays off of Duvall and Scatman Crothers really well.
839;His few scenes with Nicholson are secondary as Nicholson is kind of doing his own thing, and you kind of forget who or what else is in the room.
840;the movie, and Nicholson's performance is iconic.
841;Again, it's a beautiful film, and so well shot, you should watch it just to see see Kubrick at the top of his game.
842;if you're only familiar with the film, then make sure you pick up King's novel.
843;I love how meticulous this director was in making this film.
844;See how many things you can find in the film that may have to do with the Apollo 11 mission.
845;I think Shelly Duvall's performance as Wendy Torrance is the soul of this film.
846;This is a classic and one of Jack's best.
847;seat type of movie from start to finish.
848;I've read the book, I've seen the film.
849;As good as the book is the film is that much better.
850;invention of the theme under the same title.
851;the movie held my attention from start to finish, and geuniunely scared me at parts.
852;Much has been made of the characters, so let's review them.
853;This is consistent with the character's history as explained in the film.
854;As a side note, this is consistent with the Jack in the book, who never sought outside help to help him control his drinking (unlike the miniseries, the first 20 minutes or so of which seemed like Jack doing a commercial for AA).
855;In this film (and in the book) Jack's erratic nature was invisible to his family because they loved him blindly.
856;danny's performance in the movie is also widely criticized as over the top, especially with regards to the redrum sequence.
857;Furthermore, the Tony in the film was largely unseen, like the Tony in the book, which enhanced the effect of his role greatly.
858;a lot is made about the elements of the book that were excluded.
859;This was consistent with the tone of the movie and enhanced it greatly.
860;again., I urge viewers to watch this movie with an open mind.
861;Instead, try to appreciate the creepy atmosphere, shockig visuals and excellent performances.
862;From the cinematography to the cast, this film is by far one of the best I have seen.
863;The story of John, Wendy and Danny Torrance's experience while takeing care of the """"Overlook Hotel"""" for for the winter months is masterfully told."""
864;Watching Jack Nicholson portray a man teetering on the edge of sanity and finally crossing over the line while terrorizing his wife Played By Shelly Duval is mesmerizing.
865;A modern classic of horror.
866;Jack Nicholson played a great part.
867;Well after seeing Shelly Duvall's performance, I can see why.
868;probably the best in the entire movie.
869;The only part that I was impressed with was when Danny was riding along on his Big Wheel through the hotel.
870;or, barring that, see if you can find the 3.
871;I may have enjoyed the story more today than I did thefirst time, which for me was all about the special effects and fright they elicited.
872;One of my favorite movies.
873;Hands down, this movie was simply a masterpiece.
874;I loved the 1980's movie, but had not watched it in years.
875;I liked how his look as time went on began to change.
876;"His performance is SO good (""Go check it out."")"
877;This movie made me a huge Jack Nicholson fan and I love all his movies but THIS one in particular stands as his absolute BEST, at least for me.
878;I would recommend this to ALL
879;I really like horror movies and Jack Nicholson so I doubled my pleasure with this movie.
880;LOL It showed up on time and I enjoyed it that same evening.
881;The Kubrick movie is great.
882;And the ghosts and ghoulies are great!!
883;I've always loved this movie!
884;"First of all, i must state quite simply
885;This is TRUE horror, suspense at it's greatest.
886;It is IMHO Nicholson's greatest performance, he is PERFECT.
887;And the set design is UNBELIEVABLE!
888;This movie is more realistic then the book.
889;Kubrick truely is a genius.
890;It's amazing how an old school movie .
891;can still trump the nerves.
892;But Jack really shines through (as he often does) and makes this flick almost work.
893;Scatman Crothers was a wonderful choice in the role of Halloran, the cook who tells Danny about 'the shining'.
894;The boy who played Danny did a good job as the kid.
895;Jack Nicholson does a great job of saving this movie, but there is such a drag factor in so many of the movie's downfalls, it's still only worth 3 stars.
896;Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', judging by its cult reputation over the years, and its high rating on this website, has become a classic.
897;It has a legendary performance by the legendary Jack Nicholson.
898;What happens during their stay is a series of terrifying events that leads to a tragic conclusion.
899;What is most interesting about 'The Shining' is that it horror film that not like most other horror films.
900;This is a good thing and it is not surprising that Kubrick followed this formula.
901;kubrick, once again, shows his masterful craftsmanship for film.
902;But at the same time, this mastery is his greatest flaw.
903;Nicholson gives one of his most memorable performance as a writer who goes mad at his stay in the hotel.
904;Near the end of the film, when he confronts his wife by his typewriter, is absolutely awesome film.
905;Nicholson is at his most brilliant.
906;He plays his character so well.
907;Good, good movie that will keep you up at night.
908;The styles in this movie may be dated, but it's as scary and as entertaining as ever.
909;This is one of the best horror movies I've seen.
910;It has some really nice done scary parts like the sisters (Watch this movie and you'll know what I mean "
911;Plus it has a lot of parts that make you think!
912;This is a very good, serious and well done horror movie.
913;But The movie looks great!
914;"In my opinion, this is the best ""horror"" film ever made."
915;and that is why its the best, really.
916;Kubrick is a genius who has no equal.
917;This is the genius of it all.
918;kubrick knows how to scare, he knows what fear really is and he knows how to pick a soundtrack.
919;This music is downright chilling.
920;This is a movie I saw for the first time well over ten years ago and ever since certain scenes have never left me.
921;This is a study of the psyche, an exploration of fear itself.
922;The style of the film, with its minimalistic use of music and the cinematographer's use of wide.
923;angle shots to give a sense of open space, make for an interesting experience.
924;This film is a ghost story by film's end, but a journey into madness along the way.
925;top moments meant to invoke terror.
926;Anyway, if you love Jack, then this movie is essential viewing.
927;note: I watched this film again recently and I found myself looking at the film from Jack's perspective instead of the little boy's.
928;I found that to be equally unsettling.
929;While containing small aspects of what the book wished to convey, there is nothing believable about this movie, unlike the totally engrossing novel.
930;Maybe that is what Mr. Kubrick wished to convey, but it certainly does not do justice to the brilliant novel.
931;Shelley Duvall is just plain weird, and Stanley Kubrick morphed Stephen King's bestselling novel into something almost unrecognizable, yet THE SHINING stands the test of time and continues to scare generation after generation of wide.
932;deck Jack Torrance is so aptly and believably played by a demonically grinning Jack Nicholson.
933;made for Creepy Jack, who fits into the lead role like wiggling fingers into a well.
934;I don't know what it's like firsthand to watch a man become violently evil, but Jack Nicholson in this movie gives me a pretty good idea.
935;Pardon me while I play the grand piano.
936;Nicholson's characterization of Jack Torrence was absolutely despicable from the outset.
937;Her's was the ONLY performance I thought was believable.
938;She managed to capture confusion, horror, and pathos all at the right times.
939;"See, Danny had the gift to ""shine""."
940;"see the future
941;Yeah, right"
942;It is rated R for retarded.
943;I've been a fan of Stanley Kubrick 's movies and books for many, many years.
944;The Shining is one of my all.
945;Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice to play the role of Jack Torrence in the movie, and Shelley Duvall as his wife, Wendy, did a fine job as well.
946;It was nice to view this Blu.
947;This is an epic horror film, I highly recommend viewing this movie on Blu.
948;One of the best horror movies in creation.
949;i haven't read Stephen King's novel so I can't make a fair comparison but the movie was done quite well and Nicholson, as always, played his part so well that you feel as though you're losing it along with Torrance.
950;the late Stanley Kubrick may not have faithfully translated King's tale to the big screen but it's pretty good, nonetheless.
951;Jack Nicholson is still wonderful as a normal guy sliding into madness, he may chew the scenery but I dare you to look away.
952;This was a great movie, with lots of suspense and twists.
953;I would recommend this movie as a must watch classic for Halloween.
954;I love the book and movie!
955;Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors!
956;This movie has a great cast that gives a great performance!
957;This is an iconic performance by Nicholson and a great Kubrick film.
958;I love the winter setting and everything about this movie!
959;top portrayal of alcoholic Jack Torrance to Danny's finger.
960;He would have made Dad proud on top of it.
961;I saw this in the theatre when it first came out, and it made an indelible impression on me.
962;It is as exciting the fifth time as it was the first.
963;Be sure and read the sequel, Dr. Sleep .
964;If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get.

966;star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role.
967;is actually in the script.
968;this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant it finally is.
969;Shelly Duvall is perfect in this as also Jack Nicholson.
970;And filmed at Stanley Hotel is perfect place for this.
971;This is a great horror movie that could give you insomnia.
972;Jack Nicholson is fantastic in this movie as an alcoholic father cooped up with his kids while snowed in as a caretaker in a haunted hotel.
973;When he comes down the hall with the ax in his hand, I think it is one of the best scenes ever in a psychological horror film.
974;Everybody should have this movie in your collection!
975;This film slowley but shorley creepes you out, I don't think any one but Jack Nicholson could have played this role that well, and Krubrick has the best feal in the world, and the score is one of the best ever put in a movie.
976;The movie is really scary.
977;This film is about as close as it gets to modern genius.
978;Kubrick just pulls you into the story and sets up an atmosphere of fear and uneasiness with a great cast and haunting images.
979;Did I mention that he compiled a great cast?
980;The actors he chose were perfect for their roles (more specifically Jack, his wife and child) that makes the movie that much more unusual and terrifying.
981;A true masterpiece if you ask me.
982;Kubrick delivers an absolutely brilliant interpretation of King's novel.
983;The soundtrack is superb .
984;Scatman Crothers also delivers a memorable performance as Danny's extra.
985;which will prove incredibly insightful for any Kubrick fan or The Shining fanatic.
986;enjoy the movie and give Jack his props.
987;Another timeless gem not only for horror movies but for movies in general.
988;This remains one of the best, most suspenseful films of all time!I watched it with my teenage son and he was blown away by the fact that everyone that you care about did not meet a horrible end as is the case in all the modern slasher type movies.
989;jack Nicholson delivers a truly terrifying performance and Shelly Duvall convinces you that she is having a nervous breakdown throughout.
990;on the director which made me go back and watch this movie again after all these years.
991;This is one of the top kubrick films on my list along with Full metal jacket , barrylyndon and of course a clock work orange this is also one of my top 20 scarriest movies along with the exorsist chainsaw massacre etc. + the fact that the book was written by one of my favorite authers Stephen King if you have not yet witnessed the horror of the shining I highly reccomend it.
992;"For me, that one horror film was this masterpiece, Stanley Kubrick's ""THE SHINING""."
993;And my family knew it, too.
994;"I said, ""Yes,"" feeling proud inside."
995;Truly a classic psychological masterpiece of modern horror!
996;eyed Shelly Duvall both do great!
997;This movie is the scariest movie I've ever seen.
998;I love this movie so much and it is way underrated.
999;I think it should get some kind of special award for the greatness of the film.
1000;Jack Nicholson is amazing in this movie, the way his eyes just stare right at you in that evil demented way.
1001;REDRUM now has me scared to death everytime I look at a mirror, I just love it.
1002;Stephen King has inspired two kinds of movie adaptations .
1003;"meltingly bad (""Dreamcatcher"") and the ones that are considered quite good (""Misery,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"")."
1004;The Shining is often considered to be the best adaptation of King's works ever, primarily because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick.
1005;A very chilling horror movie .
1006;His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is eager to stay at the overlook.
1007;"According to the chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), he has the ""shining,"" which is basically any psychic abilities that the plot should demand."
1008;Jack has plenty of time to write, and Wendy and Danny are able to explore the giant hotel and hedge maze.
1009;well, it's a TERRIBLE adaptation.
1010;it feels like Kubrick liked a one.
1011;"This gives ""The Shining"" a peculiar unevennness ."
1012;some parts are pure King, others are pure Kubrick.
1013;"taken purely on its own merits, ""The Shining"" is an excellent psychological thriller ."
1014;swinging climax, but Torrance's legendary rampage is definitely worth seeing.
1015;the rest of the cast is pretty solid, though .
1016;Lloyd gives a decent performance as Danny, and Crothers is waaaaayyy underused as the kindly psychic chef.
1017;for goodness sake's this movies an Icon!
1018;directed by and Icon!If Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson had a baby it would be The Shining!
1019;I love this movie, it's definitely a classic.
1020;A great movie for a group on Halloween.
1021;This is a good copy.
1022;When I watched it, I was impressed with Nicolson's acting.
1023;Still a good movie tho.
1024;Still a scary movie, even if you haven't seen it since childhood.
1025;Brings back a whole lot of memories.
1026;Great movie whether you saw it in theaters back in the day or are seeing it for the first time!
1027;Jack Nicholson is perfect and Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job.
1028;It was the first scary movie I ever say and to this day, my brother and I are still freaked by it and we saw the TV version in the 80's as kids!
1029;The Shining is one of the most classic creepy, Stephen King stories ever written!
1030;This movie will engulf you with the ongoing twist of events that is this scary movie!
1031;Jack Nicholson and Shelley DuVall are a fantastic pair!
1032;Watch this movie if you want to know the meaning of Redrum Redrum!
1033;Reading the book now and its excellent, well written and more obviously more detail than the movie
1034;The best Horror movie I've ever seen.
1035;The best cult film I've ever seen.
1036;Krubrick's ending works better for a film than the novel's.
1037;Krubrick's dark vision while not completely true to King's is a masterpiece.
1038;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!
1039;The idea was so intriguing that I became fascinated by the film itself.
1040;After reading the novel I understand completely why Stephen King disliked Kubrick's adaptation.
1041;I found myself wondering how the screen play even came from King's novel.
1042;i highly recommend the novel The Shining to anyone who watched the movie and enjoyed it .
1043;wow, one of the craziest movies, epic.
1044;Vibrant colors (no bleeding), nice smooth image, nicely detailed, clear Dolby 5.1.
1045;This new edition could have used more extras but it includes a delighfully playful commentary by Vivian Kubrick on the documentary she shot on the making on the film.
1046;It is one of those classic horror films that many years later is still very scary, disturbing and original.
1047;It is very well acted by Jack Nicholson and the rest of the cast including Shelley Duvall.
1048;This is a must see and should be part of your collection!
1049;I'm woefully underqualified to review a master classic movie like this.
1050;It managed to scare, thrill and keep me glued to the screen.
1051;Excellent story, characters, scenery, just about everything.
1052;I've heard all of the debates about the original film, the book and the remake I care to indulge .
1053;That said, I love this one.
1054;This is basically the story of a haunting and cabin fever combined.
1055;star cast and it's a Kubrik film so more reason to watch it.
1056;He found an outlook hotel deep in the top of the montains.
1057;This is a great movie.
1058;liked the interviews that they added.
1059;This special edition of The Shining is fantastic, especially in hi.
1060;"I'm honestly not a movie buff like many voicing these concerns, but I love the movie, went out and bought it at a retail store, and watched it at home
1061;It is still scary as hell!Jack Nicholson gives an amazing performance as the troubled writer who is taken over by the hauntings at the Overlook hotel.
1062;It may not be loved by Stephen King himself, but I, including millions of others, love it.
1063;This is a very unique film that stands on its own.
1064;It also delivers some haunting images and iconic performances.
1065;Now I do like a few recent horror films such as Saw, Event Horizon, and House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Shining remains as my #1 favorite in this specific genre.
1066;There have been film critics and college professors who always discuss everything from the opening aerial shot to the photograph right before the end credits.
1067;but aside from the ambiguous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance.
1068;Nicholson is without a doubt a fascinating actor"
1069;Here, you can see some fine examples.
1070;It's a very effective performance, and one of his greatest in his entire career.
1071;The other performers do extraordinarily well themselves.
1072;Scatman Crothers is believable as the chef Dick Hallorann, while Danny Lloyd is surprisingly good as Danny.
1073;Her fear and desperation look genuine.
1074;I won't say much about The Shining, since it'll probably make this review look like a short story, but I will say that it's one of my favorite films, and my top favorite horror film of all time.
1075;Kudos to Kubrick, Nicholson, Duvall, Crothers, etc. grade: A
1076;One of the most controversial movies in Stanley Kubrick's lexicon, The Shining polarizes fans of the book and film a great deal.
1077;So how is it as a movie?It is a masterpiece.
1078;Kubrick is one of the greatest film makers of all time with such classics as 2001, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange under his belt.
1079;The Shining is probably his most accessible movie for a general audience.
1080;I first saw this film when I was 13, and even then I was aware it was something special.
1081;This will understandably upset a great deal many people.
1082;I am a King fan myself, and have enjoyed many of his books and film adaptations.
1083;But tweaking a story can improve it in certain ways.
1084;The film alterations of The Shawshank Redemption have since become signature parts of the story, and that film is universally loved.
1085;jack Nicholson delivers one of his signature performances in this film as the slowly unhinging Jack Torrance, an oddly sympathetic but thoroughly frightening villain.
1086;Here, he delivers one of his more crazy performances and it is a treat to watch.
1087;The rest of the cast, Duvall, Crothers and Lloyd, do very nicely.
1088;Lloyd especially delivers a turnout performance as Jack's frightened son in probably the best performance by a child in a horror film.
1089;one of the most interesting parts about the story (book and film) is the setting.
1090;Isolating the characters was always effective in horror stories such as Alien and The Thing.
1091;The choice of hotel for both the interior and exterior was just fabulous, and allows for many great images to be created on the movie.
1092;And it is just perfect for building atmosphere.
1093;the film varies in just how it creates fear.
1094;It is this section of the film that most people remember, and it is not hard to see why as it is very well executed.
1095;Not a lot of new material, and that is kind of sad, but still great stuff.
1096;It is a Stanley Kubrick movie.
1097;If you are able to do that, you are in for one of the best horror films ever made.
1098;certainly one of the most captivating, but not scariest).
1099;The Shining kept me curled up in my chair with my eyes glued to the screen.
1100;"The music helps a lot
1101;So are the performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.
1102;they capture a sense of reality like nobody I've ever seen before.
1103;It also has some of the greatest photography I've ever beheld infront of a TV set.
1104;time great horror movies ever made, in every aspect.
1105;screen, but that's what S. Kubrick had intended, and it proves that he knows when and when not to make it widescreen!
1106;What he did for science fiction in 1968 with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the late, great Stanley Kubrick did for horror in 1980 with THE SHINING.
1107;season and succumbing to its power.
1108;In this respect, the basic structure of King's novel is still very much in place.
1109;jack Nicholson's performance as the father figure of the piece has caused wildly divergent opinions"
1110;"i can't think of too many horror movies whose camera work and production design are anywhere in the class of this particular film
1111;The film also achieves one of the horror genre's greatest moments by showing a huge tidal wave of blood spilling out in slow.
1112;like anything Kubrick made in his life (and like the more recent Kubrick/Spielberg collaboration A. i.), THE SHINING must be seen with an open mind.
1113;Just for myself, this film is one of the best horror films ever made because Kubrick's images linger in the mind long after the film itself has ended.
1114;Great flick, what more can be said.
1115;A classic, the ending is better than the book.
1116;This film is one of my all time favorites.
1117;i watch scenes of it all the time.
1118;I think that every actor and actress does a great job, especially Danny Lloyd, the son.
1119;The movie is scary and suspenseful and in some scenes, Nicholson goes so crazy it's hilarious.
1120;Some scenes are better than others.
1121;It does have a plus though, a quite long and interesting Behind the scenes documentary made by Kubrick's wife that has up close interviews with everyone and you even get to see Kubrick work with the actors.
1122;It's much more than a great horror film, it's a wonderful work of art!
1123;It has sense of humor, inteligence and refinement .
1124;If you like any of Stanley Kubrick's films you'll certainly love it (pay atention in its use of sound).
1125;and a short (and very good) making of.
1126;The Making Of featurette is a charming day.
1127;life type of documentary filmed and edited by Kubrick's wife.
1128;Jack is his nuerotic and entertaining self the whole way.
1129;Kubrick's signature is lingering shots with haunting music.
1130;Mood is his canvas, and it is very attractive.
1131;Jack Nicholson's most intense roll to date.
1132;The back cover tells you: """"The first epic horror film ."""
1133;Just as good as the first time I'd seen it.
1134;Filled with unsettling images and chilling sequences that stay with you long after the first viewing.
1135;cam cinematography is great and the low.
1136;key score really heightens the suspense.
1137;Jack Nicholson goes way over the top at times, but still, he delivers a compelling performance.
1138;Shelley Duvall, on the other hand, is very effective as Nicholson's wife who must protect his son against Nicholson's maniac killer.
1139;classic scenes such as the `Heeeeere's Johnny' sequence and the chilling ending.
1140;Stephen King aficionados may argue that the novel is better, and in many ways it is, but this film survived best in the audience's mind and in America's culture.
1141;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
1142;I love Jack Nicholson and watch all his films, however, this is the first time I have seen this one and, obviously, it was dated (26 years old).
1143;Little Danny was probably the best actor in this film in my opinion.
1144;As for the way ghost Grady appears to let Jack out of the food locker room Jack has the Shining as Danny does and this is a psychic ability.
1145;The film looks and sounds great and was a wonderful (scary) trip down memory lane.
1146;"I know there was a ""made for TV"" version of the film that was supposed to be more faithful to the book but when it comes down to the feel, this film captures the dark atmosphere of the book much better."
1147;Jack is great in this film saw it two or three times, and still enjoy it great acting from Jack Here's Johnny.
1148;from a cinematographic point of view, there are some excellent shots, although they don't necessarily lend themselves to a feeling of suspense or tension (contrast this with the editing and shot selection in `Psycho').
1149;Crothers takes a day to get to the place.
1150;"The boy's ability to ""shine"" is never really played out and ultimately ancillary to Jack's descent into madness."
1151;some reviewers consider this to be the best horror film of all time.
1152;He's good, very good, but it doesn't mean `The Shining' is great.
1153;The book was outstanding and I thought would have been hard to bring to film and I was correct.
1154;Whole volumes have been written about Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, proving that it is indeed a masterpiece of modern horror.
1155;In particular the surprise at the end (Jack Torrance picture on the wall) is a brilliant move which leaves us with the same feeling of disorientation as when we start awake from a nightmare.
1156;"Perhaps these words by M. R. James explain it all: ""the greatest successes have been scored by the authors who can make us envisage a definite time and place, and give us plenty of clear."
1157;With THE SHINING, Kubrick made a timeless chef.
1158;I love Stephen King's book, the Shining, so I wanted to see the movie.
1159;I found it startlingly imcomplete.
1160;Pick up the book, if you want a true masterpiece in horror.
1161;If you like giving your eyes a feast and your mind a relaxing treat the way only Kubrick can through his uncanny gift of the composition of a picture that intrigues your mind so much that you become addicted and find yourself revisiting the film over and over again as if to reassure yourself that you actually saw what you thought you saw the last time .
1162;then you'll enjoy this film a whole lot more.
1163;strangely though, Kubrick is such a great film.
1164;I thought the tsunami of blood from the lift was really stupid and made me want to laugh but there are many other scenes that are just stunning to behold.
1165;I thought Nicholson and Duvall played their roles excellently and the casting overall was very well done.
1166;Lots to enjoy in this film if you are a fan of Kubrick's unique gift of framing a picture to provide a veritable feast for the eyes and his uncanny ability to select excellent soundtracks to enhance the effect but don't try to understand the plot or expect to be scared out of your mind unless you scare easily.
1167;tHE SHINING is pure and simple HORROR at its creepy best.
1168;stephen King can take any road he wants with horror and still manage to keep the reader gasping for breath by the end.
1169;having never read the novel, I cannot compare or critique the similarities or differences, but I truly enjoyed Kubrick's work here and have kept THE SHINING in my video arichive for decades.
1170;Of course this is a classic and a good horror movie!
1171;No longer scary by today's standards, but The Shining is still a great thriller.
1172;The obvious reasons for it being so good are because of the acting talents of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.
1173;The script is just so well written and the actors do so well, how can you not be sucked into the movie?
1174;This is just a classic film that may not be as scary as it once was, but it is still a great movie, and that will never change.
1175;Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give both powerful and believable performances as Jack and Wendy Torrance respectively.
1176;The real star of this film though is the Overlook hotel itself.
1177;The most memorable scene for me personally will always be the scene when Jack confronts Wendy and Wendy actually walks backwards up the huge staircase while at the same time defending herself with a baseball bat from Jack.
1178;Listen to the sound of the wind as it gives the scene an errie and chilling effect.
1179;"While not the masterpiece that ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""2001"" was, ""The Shining"" represents a terrific effort by Kubrick and is one of his more recognizable films."
1180;kubricks adaptation of Stephen Kings novel differs, widely, from Kings story.
1181;"This isnt necessarily a bad thing
1182;the performances are reasonable for a horror film.
1183;Jack Nicholson is effective but occasionally a little over the top.
1184;john Alcotts cinematography is superb, particularly, his use of the steadicam in the opening title sequence and in the hallways of the haunted hotel, the Overlook, provides an eerie calm which is quite a contrast to most horror films which tend to be very loud in style.
1185;the moody, unnerving musical score is VERY good at getting one uncomfortable.
1186;A good example of its ability to make the audience uneasy is the piece of music played during the beginning title sequence, which provides a real sense of impending doom.
1187;the set design adds greatly to the eerie atmosphere of """"The Shining"
1188;The trailer is particularly interesting and quite unlike any trailers you see today.
1189;"The documentary, while not very long, provides an insightful look as to what went on behind the scenes of ""The Shining."""
1190;"The Shining is definitely one of the more effective horror films that Ive seen
1191;A psychological thriller that keeps you captivated right to the end!
1192;Jack Nicholson is convincing as a man that simply lost his mind.
1193;In spite of Kubrick's impressive and unmistakeable style.
1194;In spite of Nicholson and Duvall's remarkable performances.
1195;films 5 stars, but he just is so amazing.
1196;Stanley Kubrick's """"The Shining"""" is for me, probably one of the finest """"atmospheric"""" horror films ever made, thanks to his style of photography and choice of sound track to heighten suspense."""
1197;Kubrick's unique style of cinematography is reflected in his previous works, so in a sense you could always spot a Kubrick film.
1198;The Shining is a masterpiece you must see!
1199;One of my all time favorite movies.
1200;And even the music wins 5 stars.
1201;Best scene is in the maze.
1202;ray package goes, I enjoyed all of the bonus material.
1203;Of particular interest was the interview with the amazingly talented composer .
1204;Wendy Carlos (born Walter Carlos who now happens to be a woman) and the instrument developed for The Shining and known as the Circular Controller.
1205;love the movie and the BTS stuff is great.
1206;First of all, I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the 2 film adaptations.
1207;that aside, I just watched this movie for the first time in a couple of years, and I was surprised by how well it has held up.
1208;crafted, great looking film with no soul.
1209;But, the striking visual and atmospheric qualities more than make up for a relative like of human interest.
1210;having warm, full human characters would reduce that feeling.
1211;This is definitely a valid approach, and the film manages to have genuine amount of discomfort at pretty much all times, even when not a whole lot is actually going on.
1212;as with virtually all of my favorite horror movies, `The Shining' has stunning music and visuals.
1213;garde classical stuff, from Ligeti and Bartok and others.
1214;(If anyone ever moves from one part of the hotel to another, you can rest assured that you will get to see them walking there.)
1215;I'm not really sure why the steadicam was used to extensively, but it really works, establishing a visual motif to the film, and giving us a sense of the size and isolation of the Overlook, as well as illustrating the monotony of life their via numerous similar camera angles/movements.
1216;That, and I just think that smooth, steadicam shots are, well, cool.
1217;`The Shining' has quite a few powerful images, even if some of them don't really seem to be here of there.
1218;motion is extremely cool, and actually kinda creepy, I think.
1219;His final encounter with them is quite stunning as well, particularly the tight tracking shot of him rolling through the surreal, dollhouse corridors of the hotel.
1220;(The hedge maze is very cool in general, as a matter of fact) The absolute best shot would have to be just after Jack here Danny scream in the kitchen, and rises up from below the frame, nastily grinning.
1221;But, the rest of the film is good enough that it doesn't matter.
1222;the acting is more than competent, though nobody other than Jack Nicholson really does all that much.
1223;Nicholson's performance is generally loved or loathed, but I come down somewhere in the middle.
1224;He's definitely entertaining, and quite menacing at times, particularly in the very last act, after the main encounter in their apartment.
1225;Definitely one of my 10 favorite horror films.
1226;I'd recommend you read the novel first, partially because I like it a lot, partially because the movie likely won't make a whole helluva lot of sense to someone who hasn't read it.
1227;I would like to express my appreciation for films that are not just scarey, but so well performed by their stars, so believable, and this one I especially Love because I am a big fan of Jack Nicholson.
1228;Just another great Sanley Kubrick movie!
1229;I would watch it again and recommend it if you have not seen it!
1230;If you are watching it for the first time, just concentrate on the story (wonderfully crafted by King).
1231;Then watch it again and again to admire the fine details, the electrifying performance of Jack Nicholson, and the wonderful vision of Kubrik.
1232;the special feature The Making Of The Shining is a wonderful documentary, you can see how much work was there in the background to produce such a masterpiece.
1233;haunting and nifty visuals as you might expect but the story doesn't gel, and people.you'll want Shelley Duvall to be disposed of in the most gruesome manner possible.
1234;King's best work gets the chop on the altar of artistic creativity.
1235;It's scary and funny (for those of you with a sick sense of humor) at the same time!
1236;"well, that's about all I have to say, but hear this
1237;Jack makes a good HERE'S JOHNNY scene.
1238;First of all 'The Shining' is one of the best horror movies of all time.
1239;seeing the original advertisements and trailors brings back memories.
1240;The documentary of behind the scenes by Kubrick's daughter who features Shelly Duval, Scatman Crothers, Danny Lloyd, and Jack Nicholson on the set in between scenes and during rehearsals is very rare and very good.
1241;I wanted to own The Shining because it is such a classic .
1242;Jack Nicholson at his spooky best!
1243;Seeing him young and starting out in that style that is all his own is a good way to preview his persona in future movies.
1244;And Shelley Duvall is great too .
1245;This movie will always be a Jack Nicholson/Steven King classic.
1246;Stanley Kubrick did not film The Shining in widescreen format.
1247;I loved this movie and thought it was a great horror movie.
1248;frame and the sound for being mono.
1249;It's one of the best horror flicks of all time, and the only people who hate it are usually those who are unable to THINK.
1250;With every repeat viewing, you can find some new food for thought.
1251;Watch the scene and you'll see what I mean.
1252;the steadycam shots, and the camera angles in general, especially the one where the camera is looking UP at Nicholson in the storage room, are incredible .
1253;change marks, hairs, and who knows what else, but it's still better than the videotape.
1254;looking appearance which is part of it's charm .
1255;This movie is in its own league above all others in its accurate portrayal of the feel, the prescient atmosphere, and the palpable enveloping terror that surrounds the family in the Overlook (not to mention myself when I read the book).
1256;I hear Rebecca DeMornay is a hoot.
1257;Again, a classic film, and it's highly recommended!!!
1258;Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall star in Stanley Kubrick's 1980horror film based on Stephen King's novel.
1259;This isone of Jack's best and I'm glad I got this special edition thathas nice picture and sound plus neat extras.
1260;Definitely addthis to your horror collection.
1261;It's everything a horror movie should be: great actors, creepy hotel, eerily happy ending!
1262;A tense thriller based on one of Stephen King's horror masterpieces, this is an 'isolation' story, in that it shows a handful of characters cut off from the outside world.
1263;The mansion is wonderfully eerie, especially the scenes involving the big, empty intimidating house from the point of view of a child.
1264;Probably Stephen King's best work.
1265;Jack feels the quiet will help him finish the novel he's been working on.
1266;The plot is a strong one.
1267;It starts off slow but builds to a great climax.
1268;this movie is certainly is remembered for two things I believe.
1269;whether your a fan of suspenseful thrillers, a Stephen King fan, or just a fan of a well made movie The Shining is worthy of your collection.
1270;Ok, this is the real deal.
1271;Jack Nicholson creates a very spooky enviroment around the creepy hotel in the middle of nowhere.
1272;The extra content is pretty cool too.
1273;This is a classic of 80's scary movie genre.
1274;Nicholson delivered a perfect rendition of the character in King's novel, so good that even Duval's cheese acting did not distract from it.
1275;I believe that the best 'adaptations' are not those that are tightly based on the original novels, but those that have borrowed from the originals and added their own sense of brilliance.
1276;This brilliance is recognizable throughout.
1277;Every scene in this movie was constructed intentionally, and the use of music, visuals, and time reinforces the psychological effects it has on the viewer.
1278;I like the movie and will look elsewhere for a disc that works.
1279;Just the thought of taking care of a vacant hotel in winter is intriguing.
1280;It's pretty neat, even though it was cut by Kubrick from an hour to thirty minutes.
1281;There's also a trailer, featuring music by Wendy Carlos.
1282;It has a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, in contrast to this one in mono.
1283;It now ranks in the top 3 of all time scariest movies I have ever seen.
1284;Nothing jumps out and catches you off guard, it's great camera work combined with a soundtrack that just creeps you out.
1285;A must watch for anyone who is a fan of horror films.
1286;I watched this movie with my son and I had forgotten how good the movie is and what a great actor Jack Nicholson is in this movie.
1287;Specially for Mr. Jack Nicholson's great performance .
1288;I have seen this movie over and over again since it's release in 1980 and every time I watch it I discover new layers and levels of psychological horror in the way Mr. Nicholson gradually descends into madness until the very end when he tries to CHOP HIS FAMILY TO PIECES!!
1289;And of course all the supporting cast is excellent too!
1290;This is a great issue of this movie for a great price for 2 disc set and in widescreen transfer for the first time ever!
1291;I read the book 15 years ago and it is a cornerstone in my fondness to King.
1292;danny, one of the most original characters in King's pallette, was turned into a shadow doing nothing but just cringing.
1293;I saw this film last night and I quite liked a few things about the film which I will share with you.
1294;The reason the film manages to have a huge effect on me was because of the big mansion the film was shot in.
1295;Some very solid performances by the kid called Danny.
1296;the reason the shining manages to hold the gravity and an everlasting fright mixed with entertainment impact on my mind is because of how non self.
1297;also check out """"Thinner"""" if you like this film."""
1298;Although it's not one of those films that make you jump out of your seat it manages to entertain nonetheless.
1299;The Others is also another worthy recommendation.
1300;I'd recomend it to anyone.
1301;This is one of the best classic horror movies, and I had to own it on Blu.
1302;ray after first watching it.
1303;When you see Danny riding his little troller, how aren't you hooked.
1304;the plot of the movie is one of the most creative that I've ever seen.
1305;I never read it and mr. King must be a pretty cocky guy if he thinks that he can remake this movie and top it.
1306;Only this movie, Mulholland Drive and Psycho stand as perfect movies in my opinion.
1307;jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, takes a job to watch over and maintain a hotel complex up in the mountains in Denver.
1308;He goes there with his wife Wendy and son Danny.
1309;danny has the shining, an ability to see dead people and horrifiying images.
1310;He can also maintain conversations without opening his mouth.
1311;the score is brillinat, going along with the pace of the movie.
1312;the cinematography is my favorite part of the movie.
1313;It is the best of all time.
1314;And that definitely builds up the chills.
1315;Jack Nicholson gives his best performance and one of the best of all time.
1316;He is terrifying and has so many great lines.
1317;shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd also give very good performances notably Lloyd.
1318;the Shining is an absolutely horrifying movie, and is one of the few movies that scare me.
1319;Probably the scariest movie, I have ever seen: Jack Nicholson does a great job of bringing this deranged psychopath persona on scree.
1320;The payment is attractive and the change may bring him new airs in his artistic profile.
1321;Dark visions occur repeatedly, curious spirits invade the intimacy of this family.
1322;Gradually these visions will grow with major intensity, and eventually will affect the mental sanity of this writer.
1323;The progressive inner dissolution will reach unexpected levels of tension, and physical violence against his own family.
1324;stanley Kubrick once more, dictated a true Directorial Cathedra.
1325;His wonderful travelings, and original camera angles, the astonishing and suspenseful script plus the mercurial performance of Jack Nicholson made of this film one of the favorite icons of many hard fans all around the world.
1326;This version of `The Shining' is much closer to straightforward psychological horror, albeit with a very Kubrick twist.
1327;top performance is a memorable one.
1328;Really, Nicholson carries the entire film, although Scatman Crothers deserves praise for his performance as the sympathetic Halloran.
1329;There are also excellent cameos from Philip Stone as the sinister Grady, and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the bartender.
1330;acting during the intense scenes.
1331;as expected from Kubrick, the technical aspects of the film are exceptional.
1332;ups, both during the intense scenes and to depict Jack's slow decent into madness.
1333;Another technical highlight is the opening overhead sequence of Jack's car approaching the Overlook.
1334;note that, as with all his works, this is very much a Kubrick film first and a genre film second.
1335;While it may not be the best adaptation of King's book, `The Shining' stands well enough on its own merits.
1336;Possibly the best horror movie of all time, Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director.
1337;Duvall and Nicholson play so well, both human characters with their flaws (okay, Jack's a bit more flawed than most).
1338;i drop it a star purely from beligerance against the novel adaptation.
1339;Delivered sooner than I thought it would take, in good condition, wrapped, and it plays well!
1340;I actually got 2, I for myself and the other for a friend.
1341;so we can have a movie night and watch together!
1342;That said I would love to one day see the director's cut, I think it would do the book far more justice and be a far better film.
1343;If you try it I hope it works for you.
1344;p. s. I contacted Amazon and they promptly refunded my money!What a great service!
1345;While I'm a big Stephen King fan, The Shining certainly wasn't one of his best works.
1346;wonderfully directed, acted, and written, the shining is a true masterpiece in film.
1347;the movie is far from the book yet it still possesses a certain magnificence.
1348;but still, it is a classic
1349;"All things considered, at least from a horror movie connoisseur's perspective (like myself), Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece called ""The Shining"" is probably the scariest movie of all."
1350;The result is a perfect piece of horror cinema in every way imaginable.
1351;Kubrick's choice of actors in this movie is absolutely perfect as Jack Nicholson, Danny Lloyd and Shelley Duval all turn in brilliant performances that really bring the terror home to the audience.
1352;"the plot of ""The Shining"" is simple and yet highly effective in producing horror."
1353;Torrance, a writer, is on his way to interview for his job as the winter caretaker of the magnificently beautiful Overlook Hotel.
1354;jack and his family move to the hotel and Jack begins writing again.
1355;Except for a snowcat mobile and a CB radio, the family is entirely cut off from any kind of civilization and the only world for Jack and his family is themselves and this huge and yet darkly beautiful hotel they reside in.
1356;nicholson's performance of a man who is gradually going mad as each day goes by is so powerful that he should have won an oscar for his role in this film.
1357;The Shining is a model horror movie that shows the manifestations of a madman so that the audience actually sees it happening before Wendy (Jack's wife) does and this is terrifying in and of itself.
1358;it is obvious to the audience that Danny is already a troubled child with a dubious gift that only adds to the eerie atmosphere that Kubrick instills into this glorious piece of horror cinema and this is yet another brilliant and yet terrifying element to this great movie.
1359;"Danny's troubles involve this amazing psychic ability called by Mr. Halloran (the head chef at the Overlook) ""the shining""."
1360;"however, ""the shining"" is not just being able to connect with other gifted individuals and being able to see the future, but also being in touch with the past or particular people or places associated with the past and often a dark and disturbing past."
1361;True, the supernatural and evil elements present in this movie are horrifying enough and are brilliantly captured and presented by Kubrick and his cast to really bring home actual fear and terror to any sophisticated horror movie audience.
1362;the idea of a woman and her child being isolated and snowbound in a huge hotel with a husband who is obviously losing his mind to go with his already violent temper is enough to make anyone experience the fear that Wendy and her son experience in this film.
1363;"the score associated with ""The Shining"" is one of the greatest horror movie soundtracks or all."
1364;This darkly and absolutely harrowing score presents theme and mood brilliantly from scene to scene and never lets up on the audience, but actually gets more and more disturbing as the movie progresses.
1365;"The atmosphere presented by Kubrick in ""The Shining"" is so effective that I would still be scared to watch this film in a strange two story house."
1366;the movie is that powerful and that moving for the audience that it actually grips one's heart and mind and never lets go, even after the movie is over, the residual effects of this movie will stay with you for years.
1367;"time, Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while certainly one of the greatest, is without a doubt the scariest movie of all."
1368;It is my hope that the picture and sound are improved dramatically by this edition.
1369;the shining is by far one of the best bone chilling movies.
1370;so good, so sinister, and jack nicholson is superb.
1371;stephen king does it again, what can i say the man is a genius.
1372;A fantastic film I could watch again and again.
1373;I just got done watching this movie that was recommended to me by a friend.
1374;I started a new style of review, but I got interrupted part of the way through, and it RUINED the flow of seeing the movie as it happened.
1375;It was a fresh new outlook.
1376;a. review, but now it's top.
1377;up because I'm Howard Tuttleman, and I can do that.
1378;A dad, a mom, and a smart little.
1379;The other two however, I made a personal connection with them.
1380;Basically, throught the movie he has thought.
1381;"He has a power called ""The Shining"" that makes him go through all of this."
1382;standing power after seeing this movie.
1383;This is really important for my career!
1384;If I stop in the middle of my review it will RUIN it!
1385;mares for the rest of my life.
1386;I shiver at the thought.
1387;and I can TOTALLY relate to that persuasive bar.
1388;"What I'm talking about is how people are always like, ""come on Howard, do something crazy with your fire."
1389;"works at something highly flammable we won't talk to you anymore!"""
1390;Okay, okay, just this one time guys.
1391;oh, and there's this great hedge.
1392;movie, so I'm having thought.
1393;I loved it I am not sure why I have waited so long to watch this classic movie but it worth to watch.
1394;It is old style to scare people with axes and physical harassment.
1395;His characteristic wide open sets, deliberate pacing, moody soundtracks and sparse dialogue were characters as well.
1396;This is a timeless classic that I never grow tired of seeing.
1397;Similar to a fine wine, it gets better with age.
1398;i bought this movie because i wanted to see what friend talk about it and i loved it and i loved it
1399;This movie is so good.
1400;It sends Chills up my spine evertime I see it.
1401;The picture on this new transfer is stunning.
1402;You can almost reach out and touch the Overlook.
1403;It's like you're inside the hotel.
1404;A tour de force for Mr Nicholson who lets fly all his acting skills.
1405;Along with Carrie perhaps the best film of a Stephen King original.
1406;If you willingly suspend disbelief the film can be remarkably unsettling.
1407;I very proudly love the book and both movies!
1408;There are movies with multi.
1409;million dollar special effect and makeup budgets that give you a good scare.
1410;directing talent of Stanley Kubrick, and the acting talent of Jack Nicholson.
1411;It's hard to imagine anyone but Nicholson provide the genuine insanity of Jack Torrance.
1412;Coupled with exquisite cinematic talent of Kubrick, the scenes of The Shining are far more realistic and horrifying than any amount of special effects could achieve.
1413;again, I largely credit Kubrick with the success of the Shining, not Stephen King, whose other book.
1414;I think this is the scarriest film I have ever seen.
1415;These imaginations are worked out really good.
1416;If you haven't seen this film yet, go kick yourself and make sure you see this film ASAP!
1417;Read it in two days.
1418;If you didn't read the book, you wouldn't notice and could truly enjoy the show.
1419;This film is what made Jack Nicholson a household name.
1420;It also improved Stephen King's popularity as an author after other classics like Carrie and Salem's Lot.
1421;Having loved this movie since I was a kid.
1422;You gotta love the guy!
1423;He plays the perfect deranged lunatic.
1424;Its a great movie , the scearyest of them all.
1425;And the making of the movie is great, its like hidden camera in the hotel the actors just dont seem to care about it .
1426;This is by far up to this point in time Jack Nicholson's masterpeice movie wise.
1427;The way the director film it was stunning and will make your mouth drop open from the scenes of the layout of the land when they are driving into the hotel.
1428;Yes this movie as a cult following due to the great actors in it and the great job by the director.
1429;I just finished reading the Shining and the movie tracks the book very well.
1430;The book was a bit too long for my taste, and therefor I really liked the movie when it came out later.
1431;This movie is a classic.
1432;It is one of the greatest horror/suspense movies of all time.
1433;In my opinion, it is the masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick's career and it displays Jack Nicholson in one of his most memorable and defining roles.
1434;When you think of classic (yet still frightening by today's standards) horror movies, this is one that will pop into the mind of almost every fan of the genre.
1435;This was a spectacular piece of work.
1436;It had a chilling soundtrack, and had some very good camera work.
1437;In the case of the Shining, a movie has finally exceeded the book upon which it was based.
1438;Another example is during an argument between Jack Nicholson (who performs incredibly well throughout the entire movie) and Shelley Duvall, after which Jack storms out of the room and glances at the camera as he goes by.
1439;If you're a horror fan, or just into movies, this is definetely one to see again and again and again.
1440;There are some exceptional sequences in this film.
1441;There is a quiet scene when he asks his son to sit on his lap that is masterful in its understatement.
1442;There are a lot of exceptional extras on this disc as well.
1443;Nicholson at his horrifying best.
1444;And Stanley, the epitome of eccentricity and genius, weaving together disturbing images, sound, and esoteric meaning from the minute the opening credits begin to roll until the finale.
1445;The extra features are well worth the price of admission and this is one of my favorite Jack Nicholson roles.
1446;Try to understand how that works as far as projection goes.
1447;The creepiest music ever made for a film guaranteed to give you goosebumps.
1448;shelley DuVall is also perfectly cast.
1449;very effective piece of drama.
1450;Best realistic indoor hotel sets I've ever seen.
1451;This is the film you see in the drive.
1452;"He wants to help them ""cross."
1453;"many ""Shining"" fans hope this second book will become a movie too."
1454;The clarity of BD immerses you in the experience, as if you too were there.
1455;Kubrick's legendary attention to detail is even more appreciated in high resolution, as the grandeur of the Hotel, the exquisite details including the actor's faces and responses, jump out even more than the theatrical release.
1456;Good atmosphere of seclusion combined with Nicholson ' s great performance.
1457;Shelly played the resourceful heroine protecting herself and her child.
1458;goes right along with the book characters not big stars but they all did a very good job.
1459;i find that the older I get, the more I understand The Shining and the more I appreciate it.
1460;It truly is a great work of art.
1461;And they should have added the ending part, when they are in the hospital.
1462;This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most extreme .
1463;kubrick really seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War.
1464;It is certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes the film a classic.
1465;jack Nicholson is at his best here.
1466;He is the main reason why this movie is so great.
1467;The way his eyebrows curl up and he gets that sinister grin on his face.
1468;Gore is at a minimum as is the body count.
1469;This much is true: You won't ever want to stay in the real.
1470;I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Duvall but each time I watch this I appreciate how she nailed the helpless wife/mother.
1471;"Scatman Crothers (head chef and fellow ""Shiner"") is great."
1472;first you have to see the movie to understand what i am saying.
1473;well only kubrick can make a film that the more you watch it the more you realize that you may think you know whats its about.
1474;so on the shining kubrick paints a landscape of horror to show the dark side of a modern family life.
1475;so bringing this family into the middle of nowwhere and seeing how they might get threw an entire winter of solitude.
1476;so when jack finnlly reaches the point that he loves this place better than his family because she wants to leave he snaps.
1477;one important scean that jack says when he talks to shelly on the bed about .
1478;but a creative writer a man that could be the center of attention.
1479;had those themes there must be a link????
1480;The picture is crisp and smooth almost 3.
1481;A Clockwork Orange is also another great Blu.
1482;Brilliant music, an over the top performance from Jack and fantastic direction make this film worthy of any collection.
1483;Well this is probably hands down the best psychological thriller ever put to film with the exception of psycho.
1484;At any rate if you have never seen this masterpiece.
1485;The newer two disk versions second disk has some cool btsi with Jackie and goofy Shelly Duvall which are hilarious!
1486;Kubricks shots in the film make the movie that much creepier!
1487;The Shining is by far one of the freakiest films I have ever seen.
1488;There are so many parts that make you wonder what was going on in Stanley Kubric's head.
1489;just a terrific classic horror flick.
1490;If you are a true horror fan this one is a must see.
1491;Shelley Duvall was perfectly cast as the dullard wife in this movie and the kid, Danny gives a chilling performance.
1492;I've seen this movie at least ten times over the years and it always delivers a good scare.
1493;The movie is really good.
1494;Jack Nicholson does a great job, of course.
1495;The film was shot in a large vacated beautiful vacation get.
1496;away hotel that is humming with people during the warm summer months.
1497;Nicholson and his wife stay there to keep the place going thru the winter.
1498;It is perfect and quiet for a writer to concentrate when writng a story.
1499;The seemingly going mad writer is Nicholson's very best performance.
1500;A great horror show in color that features the ball room scene with Nicholson among the dancing crowd at the bar talking to the bartender .
1501;There are so many good ones!
1502;Kubrick's take on Stephen King's masterpiece is almost humorous, as Nicholson's over.
1503;top performance gives a truly terrifying situation comedic twists and turns.
1504;The lighting and hollow sounds of Danny's big wheel builds dramatic tension, until the climatic scenes in which Jack Torrance truly unravels.
1505;I've only waited 33 years to watch this classic.
1506;The Shining is one of those horror films that can consider itself a masterpiece of screen horror.
1507;Many people have complained on how long the film takes to build, but I fing the wait worthwhile for the terror later to come.
1508;The direction by Stanley Kubric is excellent with his dream like tracking shots of the Overlook hotel.
1509;Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd all give excellent performances as the winter caretakers of the Overlook hotel.
1510;The film is nearly perfect.
1511;"Danny (Lloyd) has a special gift called ""Shining,"" hence the film's title."
1512;(Duvall) From here the suspense builds and builds until the finale.
1513;An epic horror film in the truest sense of the word.
1514;Grain, fuzziness, and dirt can always be spotted.
1515;The film is presented full frame.
1516;I prefer widescreen, but if that's the way Kudrick wanted us to see it, then that's fine with me.
1517;(3/5)Extras: There is a very funny and interesting documentary on the making of the film.
1518;A special edition will hopefully be in the works.
1519;I haven't seen the exorcist before, I hear that's very scary, but to me this is the scariest that I have seen.
1520;The roles are perfect and this movie had me the entire time.
1521;Although it is probably more fun with a friend.
1522;"Adapted, as we all know, from a Stephen King book of the same name, the legendary director of such classics as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" created a picture here that leaves a chill running down your spine long after the credits roll."
1523;the film opens with the Torrance family.
1524;father Jack (Jack Nicholson), mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and precocious son Danny (Danny Lloyd).
1525;All he's got to do is keep the lights and heat on, call in to a ranger station on the radio every few days, and he can sit back and collect a paycheck.
1526;Problem is, spending five months cooped up in a hotel in the mountains can bring on a powerful case of cabin fever resulting in.
1527;One previous caretaker took an axe and slaughtered his entire family.
1528;Hallorann has the ability to shine as well, and is fully cognizant of the powers the Overlook can unleash with ease.
1529;The Shining isn't so much a film as it is an experience to savor.
1530;for those who can stand the terror, that is.
1531;"His line ""Hereeee's Johnny"" is arguably one of the best."
1532;As amazing as the performances are, however, they pale in comparison to the look and feel of the film.
1533;"So many great scenes rise to the forefront of my memory as I write: the chase through the maze, that last soul shattering shot of Jack Torrance, and Wendy's discovery of ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" all exquisitely torture the audience."
1534;Get out and see it now!
1535;using a script based on the novel by Stephen King, director Stanley Kubrick has created a story with menacing settings and excellent performances by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd.
1536;Duvall plays his wife Wendy, and Lloyd stars as the Torrance's son Danny.
1537;Soon, Jack is experiencing his own psychological changes.
1538;Shelley Duvall does a fine job as the scared wife, and Danny Lloyd's performance of Danny, who has psychological powers, is very good as well.
1539;I highly recommend this thrilling and scary film.
1540;Without all the gore and special effects present in most suspense/horror movies today, The Shining manages to haunt generation after generation with superb acting and a time.
1541;This is one of those great horror films that never gets old.
1542;It is so freaky and every time I watch it I get scared.
1543;in my opinion it is the best stephen king movie ever made.
1544;i would highly recommend anyone watch this, even if your not a stephen king fan.
1545;This is one of my favorite all time movies!!!!
1546;The movie is awesome because of Jack Nicholson's acting.
1547;I thought I would be more spooked out by it but it was actually kind of funny in some scenes (the old lady in the bathtub, classic horror scene).
1548;Jack Nicholson was good in it.
1549;absorbed and the book is classic literature.
1550;I'm a fan of both of them.
1551;dimensional characters and seen as a mood piece, The Shining is pretty hard to surpass.
1552;This is due to the camera shots (many from a child's point of view), the title cards that lose all meaning, and Kubrick's brilliant use of the music of Ligeti, Bartok and Penderecki.
1553;the acting is, to me, excellent, especially Shelley Duvall and Nicholson.
1554;Danny Lloyd is good, too, and Scatman Crothers turns in a memorable performance.
1555;The technical aspects of the film are superb, especially Danny's Big Wheel sound as he goes onto carpet/hardwood/carpet, etc.
1556;This has a great effect, however, in that you know that Kubrick will kill a character at any time (King had Jack wield a roque mallet rather than an axe, which allowed King to beat up his main characters pretty badly without killing them).
1557;She deals with all of the day to day operations of the hotel: cooking for the family, running the boiler, communicating with the outside world.
1558;Even then she has enough sense to defend herself.
1559;Kudos to Wendy, one of the most unsung heroines in all of horror films!
1560;see film in all aspects: the story (based loosely on Stephen King's book), the photography (with use of the stedi.
1561;cam), the acting and finally the music.
1562;"(The music is extremely haunting)The special features found on the second disc are excellent, as they provide not only a ""making of"" documentary made by Kubrick's daughter, but also other interviews and insights about the making of the film."
1563;The Shining strikes me as one of only three Stephen King adaptations that are completely successful, the others being Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.
1564;For this reason, the film has never really pleased many fans of the original book who believe that films must be faithfully and accurately transcribed to screen in order to be considered a successful adaptation.
1565;watching The Shining today, what strikes one are the uncommonly elegant sets, the lack of special effects (one trick shot of the hedge maze notwithstanding), the gliding Steadicam cinematography and the tricky tone the film manages to maintain between horror film, domestic drama and very black comedy.
1566;In any event, Nicholson is great in the film, perhaps his finest performance.
1567;"There is some grain evident and the colors don't quite ""pop"" in the same way that they do for some more recent films but this is undoubtedly the best The Shining has ever looked on video."
1568;Considering this is one of the best photographed films of it's period, I think most people will be pleased with the picture.
1569;But Jack does such a great job as a reformed dad who goes crazy while trying to write the great American novel as his wife and son help him babysit an abandoned hotel, vacant for the winter.
1570;You feel enough for the characters that you drawn into each of them, thereby scaring you and making you feel for them that much more.
1571;tHis is a movie that I will time and time again watch.
1572;"While I still don't get creeped out or scared by this movie, I love the ""horror"" aspect of it."
1573;In all of my twenty three years, nothing I've seen since has affected me quite so deeply as Stanley Kubrick's masterful retelling of Stephen King's little tale about a family, a hotel and a force of pure evil.
1574;I love scary/thriller movies and for some reason I've never seen this movie.
1575;Great movie and Jack Nicholson best movie.
1576;This movie is great it made me jump and sit at the edge of my seat.
1577;Jack Nicholson is at his scary best.
1578;so, let's talk about this Blu.
1579;it's uncommonly sharp, and adds new glory to the backgrounds and overall creep.
1580;one of the sharpest transfers I've seen!
1581;Where can you find a movie that not only portrays both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall in the roles that they were best suited for?
1582;Truly a hands down classic in this genre.
1583;As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri.
1584;This movie is one of the best films ever made that is based on a Stephen King book.
1585;Jack is going to use the time to write a book he has in mind.
1586;He is shocked when the hotel's cook who is giving them their introductory tour speaks to him telepathically.
1587;The cook (Scatman Crothers) has his ability from his grandmother and that she called it the shining.
1588;He tells Danny that he has it also.
1589;I love horror stories and movies and this one is just outstanding.
1590;It is really a classic Stephen King story that was transformed to the movie screen with a wonderful cast and great directing.
1591;Wonderful movie, been a fan for many years now!
1592;"opening feature to me was the commentary steady cam operator Garrett Brown and Kubrick biographer John Baxter
1593;This is definitely a permanent addition to my blueray collection and has increased my awareness and appreciation for Stanley Kubrick.
1594;I enjoyed this old classic that was one of the first films that used new photography techniques to film it.
1595;awful, but in The Shining , Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that is actually better than the book.
1596;season job as caretaker of a once.
1597;Jack's descent into madness and his wife's growing panic are wonderfully portrayed in the film.
1598;Shelly Duvall as his wife overdoes the shaking and quaking in some scenes, but she is very good as the wife who just wants to protect their son and get them both out of this possessed hellhole alive.
1599;The cinematography and the music are both excellent and effectively contribute to the film's atmosphere of haunting isolation and insulation.
1600;This is the greatest horror movie ever.
1601;One of the greatest movie moments is in this when the cook goes to save the family.
1602;I won't give it away but it is brilliant.
1603;It is by far the greatest addaption that any of his books has ever gone through.
1604;It was so clever and Jack Nicholson was terifying and funny.
1605;It is a great movie
1606;The Shining, starring the great Jack Nicholsen is one of the greatest horror/suspense films i have ever seen.
1607;it is a story about a novelist and his family who are invited to stay at this giant hotel in the mountains, so he can write his book in piece in guiet.
1608;words cant describe how entertaining this film is.
1609;I'd heard that the picture was top notch on this transfer and for a film made back in 1979 and released in 1980 it doesn't disappoint.
1610;It's a better cut and builds the tension better than the shorter version in my opinion.
1611;I am a Jack Nicholson freak, and I thought that The Shining was, maybe not one of his BEST, but definitely a great achievement.
1612;Stephen King's novel is shown on the screen wonderfully.
1613;It's just plain a great film!
1614;If you haven't seen it, see it!
1615;If you like scary movies this is the one to own.
1616;The Shining is a classic.
1617;One of the best movies ever, in my opinion.
1618;Jack Nicholson did a great job.
1619;And I suppose Nicholson's performance was over the top (the same can be said about George C. Scott in Dr. Strangelove ) but that's what makes it a memorable bit of screen acting.
1620;(Nicholson's conversations with Lloyd the bartender are absolutely unforgettable!)
1621;rate movie and a first.
1622;This movie is by far one of the best HORROR movies ever made.
1623;This is my favorite movie and I enjoy it more and more each time I watch it.
1624;But, I do have to say I LOVE THE MOVIE!
1625;the Shining is a masterpiece, a classic, yadda, yadda, you already know since all about since nearly 400 hundred people have already reviewed it.
1626;nOTE TO VIEWER: There are a number of hilarious parts in this film, the scene where Nicholson is staring aimlessly out the window for one.
1627;If you want to really understand Stanley Kubrick's artistic vision and unique visual style that has made him such so admired, this may be a good movie to start with.
1628;The giant mansion is the real hero of the film.
1629;throughout the movie there always some kind of strong light in the center of the screen, making an effect of surrealism.)
1630;It's also Jack Nicholson greatest performance, and there's a lot of humor in his amusing insane expressions.
1631;this movie shows that Kubrick's odd choice at making a horror film wasn't in vain, and might be his greatest achievement, especially in terms of visuals.
1632;Brilliant, creepy horror from Kubrick, with mesmerizing camera work and bizarre, arresting set pieces.
1633;Scatman Crothers is also memorable as the hotel's only other resident.
1634;Based on Stephen King's book, the film has Kubrick's slightly twisted genius all over it.
1635;This is a wonderful picture, and Kubrick, were he still alive, certainly would have approved.
1636;Added to this is the terrific new 5.1 sound mix"
1637;Warner's deserves high kudos for these fine remasters of Kubrick's films.
1638;Mr. King did decide to go deeper, and the result is one of the best books around.
1639;Nothing really interesting about his character really, but it provides for some cool movie lines.
1640;As evidenced by my four star rating, I think this is a pretty good movie.
1641;He also kind of redeems himself in the end.
1642;The book also has some great sequences that would have been great in the movie.
1643;Like the whole thing with the hedge animals.
1644;There are just so many elements of the book that could have made this movie into a masterpiece!
1645;This was a very entertaining movie, and it held my interest throughout.
1646;A great effort by Kubrick, but he could have made it a sensational effort (there I go again.
1647;I highly reccommend that you see it, and on second thought, I think the title of my review is a little harsh, but it is a cool title and I like it too much to change it.
1648;"If you feel that I just bashed one of your favorite movies, feel free to click ""NO"", but really, this is a good movie and I DID like it."
1649;Great movie, too bad it stops about 20 minutes into the movie.
1650;i think Nicholson is one of the best if not THE best actor of my time and I enjoy his performance here but do you see what happened .
1651;spelling a key word backwards ) actually made me laugh.
1652;if your a Stephen King fan you'll love it .
1653;"Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) and his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) stay for the winter at a isolated hotel called ""The Overlook Hotel"" in which they become caretakers."
1654;It's a surreal and nightmarish film about madness and supernatural with great acting by the cast especially Scatman Crothers who plays the lovable chef, the music score by Wendy Carlos is chilling for particular and the whole film is atmospheric.
1655;I am a big fan of Nicholson, Kubrick, King and of the film THE SHINING.
1656;A great movie if you didn't read the book.
1657;Stephen King's novel The Shining is a classic of modern horror and one of the author's best and scariest works.
1658;The film version of the tale may be more a product of Kubrick than King, but it is in its own way a good psychological thriller.
1659;"Nicholson's performance is masterful in only the way he can deliver such a role
1660;purists and fans of the novel might resent Kubrick's reinterpretation of King's novel.
1661;This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen.
1662;par story line but it is fun to watch.
1663;Either way, it's effectively lensed thanks to Kubrick's rigid and cerebrally born camera technique.
1664;Visually, the movie is a brick.
1665;brick reconstruction of Stephen King's novel.
1666;The violence, when it finally does come, is neat and graphic and is one of 'The Shining's strongest elements as a movie.
1667;Shelley Duvall is excellent as Mrs Torrance only in the climactic scenes near and at the movie's conclusion.
1668;That may sound frivilous and academic until one cringes from the thought of Michael Caine in the part.
1669;All things considered, by the movie's action.
1670;packed conclusion, Nicholson has thrown his gears quite visibly and he goes wonderfully berserk.
1671;His rampage is, in fact, far more appreciable and close to the Stephen King idea than has been given credit.
1672;There are many things at this director's disposal and he uses them to the full.
1673;Exquisite sets, staggering images and high grade (though far from perfect) casting all work in his favour on this assignment.
1674;Five stars would definitely do it justice for its looks and fine cinematic veneer"
1675;sized part the gist of his source material.
1676;great entertainment, if a little dragging in areas, 'The Shining' is a must.
1677;see on the order of its being a rite of passage.
1678;Watch it repeatedly for academic study or for pleasure .
1679;stanley Kubrick deserves extra respect for this work in the sense that he endowed 'The Shining' with his trademark directorial power.
1680;The movie is well armoured to withstand the criticism that it has brought Kubrick.
1681;The second disc has interesting on location home movies from the filming with behind the scenes like action with the cast, including Scatman Crothers, Shirley Duvall and of course Jack Nicholson.
1682;if you love to be scared and love movies you must see this in your lifetime.
1683;The Shining is definitly one of the scariest movies i've seen.
1684;The overlook hotel itself has great scenery and also how they show the hotel practically every time the day switches on the mountain setting.
1685;Jack is great in this role and people will always remember him in this movie.
1686;the second time time they remastered the sound and picture and it's great.
1687;Required watch for any horror film enthusiast!
1688;King weaves a wonderful story of mind games and mental breakdown.
1689;This movie captures that atmosphere and dread and makes us feel it all over again in spectacular visuals, stroking the darker aspects of our collective unconscious like a cold, clammy finger.
1690;Add into the mix Wendy Carlos's chilling soundtrack .
1691;and you have the recipe for a genuinely nightmarish experience.
1692;the acting, all 'round, is impeccable.
1693;This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
1694;This is an intelligent look at the psychological breakdown of a man in a haunted hotel.
1695;this film should be regarded as a masterpiece on its own, seperate from the novel.
1696;It is wonderful to see a horror film without cheap suspense and silly thrills.
1697;As usual a brilliant Stephen King book turned into a so.
1698;His facial expressions, line delivery, and dance with madness will forever be immortalized here.
1699;Shelly Duvall is the helpless wife who cannot cope with her husband, and finally Danny, the young son with psychic powers.
1700;of course the `ghost' characters round the film out in a great, fun filled way.
1701;The two daughters who Danny meets in the hall will give you the shivers, especially when you see them axed, their father the `former caretaker' has his own charm, the bartender, the bathtub chick, and the homosexuals in animal costumes all help Jack sink deeper and deeper into madness.
1702;so many good reviews of this movie have been written about the plot, etc.
1703;Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece.
1704;Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities.
1705;The story and setting are very simple.
1706;There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel.
1707;out madness is the movie's strongest point.
1708;the camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.
1709;the best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion.
1710;Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.
1711;the electronic musical score is great and very memorable.
1712;this movie is a classic that has stood the test of time.
1713;i highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.
1714;I remember my mom taking us to a drive.
1715;ray release on a 6 ft screen was amazing.
1716;Even knowing whats coming up next didnt take away from the viewing experience.
1717;Kubrick is still unmatched as a filmmaker.
1718;Packed with lots of great extras.
1719;* so I decided to check Amazon for a good scary movie like.
1720;time classic by the way.
1721;"Leave this ""Shining"" movie in the clearance bin!"
1722;Always enjoy watching this one!
1723;Streamed great over play station.
1724;This is a good classic film that will really scare you.
1725;It is an exercise in pure terror and a masterclass on filmmaking.
1726;"What Stanley Kubrick accomplished with ""The Shining"" was a perfect marriage of twisted psychosis, the supernatural, horror, isolation, and ambiance."
1727;From the beautiful hotel settings to the snow covered hedge maze, the movie has stunning locations and sets and succeeds brilliantly in surrounding the viewer and sucking them into the snowbound and disturbed world of Jack Torrance and the Overlook Hotel.
1728;"That is amazing company and ""The Shining"" more than deserves a spot among the best of it's peers."
1729;In this movie, Jack ownz the screen by conveying true family murdering insanity!
1730;This movie makes me laugh and cry at the same time.
1731;Stanley Kubrick is the best director ever hands down.
1732;This movie is a winner.
1733;mill horror story into a subtle psychological.
1734;Both movies are incredible i never read the book but i loved both movies.
1735;the 1997 version is 4 hours this one is 2 and keeps all the important stuff.
1736;i just watched it and it rocks.
1737;Based on the Stephen King novel, Jack Nicholson stars as Jack Torrence with Shelly Duvall as his wife.
1738;A true gem of a horror film, even if it isn't scary.
1739;"Great Movie a classic
1740;Jack Nicholson has always been considered one of our generation's greatest screen actors.
1741;yet Nicholson infuses him with a calibrated presence that makes him stand out in an otherwise so.
1742;Scary through and through, though far from being a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel (see Shawshank Redemption for the best of the lot there), The Shining still works.
1743;Its a testament to the actor Nicholson more than anything else.
1744;Somehow Stanly Kubrick hypnotized many people into believing he was a good filmmaker.
1745;Full Metal Jacket is the only exception, because it is a really good movie.
1746;The only redeeming part of the Shining is Jack Nicholson, who played the psycho as good as could be done.
1747;ray and I have to say it was every bit as good as I remember.
1748;Great performances, direction and a very eerie and effective look and feel.
1749;This is in my top 10 horror films ever.
1750;Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general.
1751;moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director.
1752;I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen.
1753;everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it.
1754;Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker.
1755;Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel.
1756;Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying.
1757;kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago.
1758;The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking"
1759;Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying.
1760;It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.
1761;the characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters.
1762;This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film.
1763;The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable.
1764;It's fine work by a child actor.
1765;The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening.
1766;Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity.
1767;Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does.
1768;top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch.
1769;He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth.
1770;Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot.
1771;Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before.
1772;I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element.
1773;The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing.
1774;It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come.
1775;It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.
1776;This version of the shining is the best version.
1777;It's Jack Nickolson in a well known movie (that I had somehow missed)!
1778;We decided to pick this classic to watch on Halloween!
1779;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1780;It's a film to be observed, analyzed, and enjoyed.
1781;I love this movie and had to add it to my collection.
1782;Jack Nicholson was perfect for the part.
1783;Its an excellent movie and I highly recommend it!
1784;This movie is amazing all around!
1785;The story is intriguing, the music builds suspense to a boiling point, and Kubrik's cinematography keeps you wondering what's around every corner!
1786;Nicholson's performance, as to be expected, is fantastic.
1787;Danny Lloyd is incredible as well as the son.
1788;Overall, this is an absolutely amazing, must see movie for an older audience.
1789;the same is true for the Shining .
1790;It wasn't until I saw it again and forced the novel out of my head, that I was able to enjoy it.
1791;Not so much the plot, but Jack Nicholson's over the top performance and the way Kubrick builds the suspense.
1792;It wasn't the novel, but it was watchable.
1793;The way its made, it will just have you glued to your screen.
1794;Best Kubric film I've ever seen and thats saying a lot.
1795;Not only does this movie have Jack Nicholson, one of the greatest actors, but it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director.
1796;No one can capture the pure insanity of Jack Taurance better than Nicholson.
1797;Shelly Duvall gets annoying at times, but overall this movie is a classic.
1798;It contains classic Kubrick camerawork, (which I love so much) and Nicholson's performance is amazing.
1799;it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.
1800;I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies .
1801;Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic.
1802;displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.
1803;Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.
1804;there is too much, let me sum up):An aspiring writer takes the perfect job .
1805;Jack Torrance thinks he's got the perfect plan .
1806;light duty job keeping an eye on things at the closed for the winter lodge with all the heat, food, and endless time he can stand.
1807;and leaves a serious chill up your spine.
1808;day after day pass and with each passing hour the tension mounts.
1809;Finally, its 3:00 in the morning and your wife shakes you.
1810;That's kind of what happened here.
1811;There was incredible tension .
1812;the storytelling was wonderful, the acting was great, the musical score was intense, and the tension was palpable.
1813;The fear and confusion displayed in this movie was truly intense.
1814;~ The cinematography was simply incredible.
1815;The hotel's colors and decorating were absolutely amazing.
1816;The scene where Danny and Wendy were in the maze and Jack saw them from the model in the hotel was just epic.
1817;right up to the end, totally anti.
1818;what I needed was an ending that matched the grandeur of the rest of the film!
1819;I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.
1820;science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review .
1821;I'd be happy to .
1822;if I have it, you'll get it.
1823;, well here is a good example of what can happen to our fragile human mind.
1824;The late Stanley Kubrick made some of the best pictures we have ever seen.
1825;His 1980 project, The Shining proved to be a big hit with the critics, and also proved that Stanley can do anything: comedy, drama, thriller, war, and in this case, terrifying and classical horror.
1826;an exceptional script from Stanley and his impressive co. writer are one of the key elements in this movie.
1827;It's engaging, it's intriguing and it has never been done before, making it a truly original film as well as a horrifying one.
1828;The actors are quite amazing, Jack Nicholson in particular in the most underrated performance of his career, and kiddo Danny Llyod manages to be believe every time, he follows Kubrick's instructions expertly as expertly as Scatman Crothers, an underrated actor with something about him that makes his characters so immensly watchable.
1829;Other than that, Kubrick's direction and Nicholson's shouldering of the film make it one of the most engaging horror films of all time.
1830;the Shining is a must.
1831;now I can finally enjoy whenever I want.
1832;My daughter loves Stephen King and this is one of her favorite movies.
1833;She was thrilled when she received this as a gift.
1834;Thanks for the free shipping option, Amazon and for the great old movies you carry.
1835;I can always count on you to have what I want.
1836;It is good though because that way, I would not be disappointed if the movie fell short from the book's story.
1837;The scenes focus on the actors' expressions instead of filling it up with cinematic gory effects thus leaving more room for the viewers' imagination.
1838;I commend the kid's acting as I find it extraordinary for a kid that age to express utmost fear as if it's real.
1839;This movie is a classic, Stanley does it again.
1840;The Shining is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
1841;Jack Nicholson slowly going insane is one of the greatest things a horror movie could have.
1842;This is one of the only Stephen King films I really like.
1843;I love his novels, but most of the films are just.
1844;There are so many memorable scenes that freak you out just thinking about them.
1845;the murdered children, the woman in the bathtub, the elevators full of blood, and (of course) the incredible chase scene with Shelly Duvall, Jack Nicholsen, and his ax.
1846;this is a pure classic!
1847;Most everyone knows of this movie based on the book by Stephen King.
1848;It is one of the best and a real thrill ride.
1849;The Shining is probably my favorite film of all time.
1850;A great performance by Jach Nicholson, a great performance by the child, and the wife as well.
1851;carrying Stephen King groupie, this movie is better than the book.
1852;To recreate, and in some areas, out freak the original is a superhuman achievement.
1853;This is the only horror movie worth watching.
1854;And B. there were a few funny parts.
1855;This happens to be one of my favorite Stephen King Stories turned into a movie that stays true to the book.
1856;This is an awesome movie.
1857;The best part is Jack N is in it.
1858;Anyway, the movie was the best.
1859;My favorite movie, and worth watching.
1860;danny Lloyd is very good as Danny Torrance.
1861;"His facial expressions when he ""shines"" is good."
1862;Good acting for a 7 year.
1863;Jack is the best, sexiest, amazing actor ever!!!!!!!!!
1864;She plays a good frightened house wife Wendy, who scared of her own spouse.
1865;scatman Courothers is a good actor too, he has a good personality for Halloren, the chef.
1866;jack plays a wonderful, breath.
1867;taking performance of a crazed physico man.
1868;This is a great movie and it was very easy to download.
1869;King had all his parts on full speed ahead when he write this masterpiece and the movie really is a good as the book because of Jack playing Jack.
1870;there are some scary scenes in it, like the two girls who suddenly appers in the hallway, and some of the scenes with JN.
1871;of great importance to the original story is the fact that the hotel is an entity, a powerful and evil force which takes the character of the father over.
1872;The movie is so much more entertaining after watching Room 237 the documentary about hidden meanings by Stanley Kubrick.
1873;Jack Nicholson does a great job at playing crazy .
1874;Although I find the movie a bit too long, it always scares me.
1875;This movie is on my top 10 list.
1876;jack nicholson's portrayal here is so completely over the top as to be comedic.
1877;it's a shame, because the cinematography is good, as is the supporting cast.
1878;One of the best Jack Nicholson movies of all time.
1879;This is a classic that everyone must see.
1880;Jack really brought his character to life.
1881;It was an unqualified five star film experience because of the master direction of Stanley Kubric.
1882;Needless to say I told my wife about it the moment I got home and asked her to see it that weekend.
1883;Even though this film was not terribly true to the King novel we both felt that it was another wonderful Stanley Kubrick movie.
1884;i also enjoyed the performances of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.
1885;Shelly Duval stated during her interview that Kubrick was merciless, but did help to bring out her very best performance.
1886;I was very surprised to hear that they thought Jack Nickolson should be ashamed of himself and that Kubrick had some nerve to release another such film in the United States (I assumed they were talking about CLOCKWORK).
1887;Excuse me, but I've known lots of very sweet, very passive women ( like Wendy in the film) who would (and have) put up with exactly the kind of bullying and abuse she puts up with from the creep wonderfully played by Jack Nicholson .
1888;a real louse even before the spooks get hold of him.
1889;ms Duvall played this type of person, desperate to please and be loved and taken care of, flawlessly.
1890;This film is a masterpiece.
1891;Unlike junk horror films, the fear builds slowly, gradually drawing you in.
1892;The camera work (using a technique that Kubrick pioneered, I understand) gives the feeling of being there with her in that haunted hotel.
1893;Easily one of the best horror films ever made.
1894;I was skeptical but approached it with an open.
1895;For the Shining to work as one film it had to be done the way Kubrick did it.
1896;Thus Nicholson's performance is justified and at times brilliant.
1897;His quick descent into madness is appropriate for (1) film.
1898;The doctor scene perhaps, but even that scene is effective, as Wendy's account of Jack's drunkenness give an ominous feel to his mannerisms.
1899;The set design of the Overlook, the profoundly creepy and atmospheric score, Kubrick's solid direction, and then the performances, which make the film soar.
1900;Horror fans know that this is one of the greatest horror films of all time.
1901;ray, but it's the best looking and sounding version of The Shining that I've seen.
1902;After reading the book I got obsessed with wanting to see the movie on blu.
1903;I was happy because of the price, but felt defeated because I had had my heart set on watching it that night.
1904;it was great to watch again, I remember watching it years ago and it's still as great as ever.
1905;This is a truly classic horror film that has reached 'cult' status.
1906;This is truly one of Jack Nicklson's BEST performances of his career!
1907;The Shining is without a doubt,the scariest film I've ever seen.
1908;jack Nicholson is terrific as Jack Torrance,the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel,in which he slowly goes insane.
1909;if you're a horror fanatic,you'll love The Shining.
1910;The Shining is first rate Kubrick, whiich is saying a great deal.
1911;or setlles for seeeing it once and moving on.
1912;"I tell her ""yeah, but he's a brilliant film maker, who films visually stunning films that are also mesmerizing."""
1913;"Based off the best selling book by Stephen King, ""The Shining"" is one of the Kubricks masterpieces."
1914;Yeah, yeah, I know for many people every movie the man made was a masterpiece, but this is one of those rare occurrences where art and entertainment collide so spectacularly, it almost feels accidental.
1915;Jack gets the job, and moves his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel for the winter.
1916;what follows is nothing short of a full decent into madness.
1917;Though this is a horror film, and the movie is indeed very scary, Kubrick is a good enough storyteller that he knows how to properly build the suspense.
1918;Wendy and Danny explore all the various rooms in the house, while Jack tried to write a novel.
1919;For the first two hours we follow a pleasant family around in this big house.
1920;It even features an image of Jack Nicholson that has become iconic.
1921;"A twist at the end will make you question and rethink the whole experience of the movie, much in the same way the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" forced a re."
1922;That you are entertained is a blessing, but the images, the words, and the silence are all working towards provoking certain feelings from you, and the story is deeper and more complicated then you might think at first.
1923;The Shining offers well thought out thrills, a complicated story, and a memorable ending.
1924;It truly is a classic.
1925;But the new transfer is clean, sharp, and colors look more vibrant and realistic.
1926;of documentary also has an improved picture, plus a new audio commentary track by its director Vivian Kubrick (the little girl in 2001).
1927;minute featurette was shot on the set of THE SHINING, thus it provides a rare, fascinating look at the director at work.
1928;talented Vitali also played the adult Lord Bullingdon in Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON.)
1929;In a film in which vast, open spaces have a great deal to do with the theme of the story, it seems fitting to add spaciousness to the composition.
1930;this movie to me is one of jack's finest pieces of work.
1931;i love it and have seen it many times but did not own it.
1932;now it will be a classic in my video library.
1933;best of all, the scares come from excellent storytelling.
1934;The movie is eerie from the get.
1935;go and showcases an interesting, dangerous dynamic between a husband, wife, and son.
1936;making master and this is one of his greatest works.
1937;I can only say this: On its own merits, this film is 5 stars and one of the best horror flicks of all time.
1938;Kubrick makes several changes that will either please you or annoy you.
1939;Kubrick's Shinning stands on it's own as one of the scariest, most unnerving horror movies ever made.
1940;On those grounds this film should be recommended.
1941;Jack does embrace a beautiful stranger who turns out to be an ugly corpse, and it is frightening when the twin ghosts tell Danny, 'we want you to play with us, forever'.
1942;the most effective scenes for me are one's where Danny is riding around the hotel in a Big wheel tricycle (I must have had one as a kid) and another scene where Danny plays with toy cars on the carpet.
1943;I Definitely played with toys in a similar fashion as a child.
1944;In some of the scenes, Wendy's eyes just look huge, and beautiful.
1945;In a lot of the other scenes her teeth look huge (and beautiful).
1946;There is a huge amount of echo and effects added to the dialog at times.
1947;For the most part I think this worked very well.
1948;At least there is some hope in that film .
1949;A must have I love this movie total classic!
1950;But for the time it was published defienetly a good movie.
1951;Its more funny then terryfing.
1952;It is one of those films that one, just as with his other films, can watch over and over again, they're all so dazzling and also because, sometimes, the more you watch, the more you pick up .
1953;if you ever see the documentary ROOM 237, you'll see what I'm talking about .
1954;This is the best copy of this film you can get next to blu.
1955;They have really overworked and cleaned this film up to pefection, clear and ver sharp picture at best.
1956;The sound is perfect to.
1957;The additional features and commmentaries are really neat and break down alot of kubricks ideas and goals and visions as a filmmaker.
1958;This is one the best pyschcological horror films ever created, of a man and his family slipping quickly in to madness.
1959;The book is basically and haunted house story, were as the kubrick film is purely a psychological horror story, beautifully crafted.
1960;Jack Nicholson gives a milestone performance as well as the whole cast.
1961;The book and the film are about dead even as far scares go, but both stories give you something new.
1962;If you liked the shining, I highly recommend director Brad Anderson's films Session 9, and The Machinist, both excellent psychological journeys.
1963;So I wanted to get the best version of the Shining before its too late.
1964;I believe this movie is best in 4:3 so if you are an addict of this movie I would get this version.
1965;Amazon got me my copy quick and in good condition.
1966;the Shining is in my top 10 movies I like of all time.
1967;So that means I can rewatch it to an uncountable figure.
1968;That means any movie that has a really good character playing a really good psycho killer.
1969;Jack is one of the best at this type of acting.
1970;I have loved this movie for years!
1971;I would recommend it to anyone.
1972;As said, this a Stephen King story, and Stanley Kubrick is doing a good job directing this movie.
1973;Jack Nicholsen and Shelley Duvall is great, but as said, it can't beat the '97 recording.
1974;One of the best movies ever in my opinion.
1975;As well as the blatent subtle hint at the begining.
1976;But the ending is so much better than the book, because it's so realistic, and tense, and the characters don't seem to be standing around, wondering what to do next like in the book.
1977;the dialogues between Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall, are really tense, and scary.
1978;That you really feel for the characters.
1979;gOd knows why Stephen King wanted to re.
1980;stanley Kubrick's The Shining is best Stephen King horror adaptation so far.
1981;But the sheer intensity of The Shining is so great, that it makes every other adaptation of his like your average run of the mill horror stories.
1982;so stop living in denial, and embrace the real Shining, that was made by Stanley Kubrick.
1983;SK is one of my favorite directors, and Jack one of my favorite actors, and The Shining is the best King book of them all, I think, so this film is just pure classic all around.
1984;I saw it the week it came out (it was a lot of fun in the theater, scared people silly at points), and unlike many films of that era it holds up perfectly today.
1985;I always wanted to see its many superbly composed shots in high def at home, and now I do, thanks to a near.
1986;the colors are crisp, with Kubrick's unique printing techniques making the snow look as good as snow ever has in a film.
1987;The sound is very clear and clean, and the only complaint I have is one that I'm seeing more and more of on BD reissues: they didn't letterbox it.
1988;As one of the bonus features here points out, he was a photographer before director, and that sense of composition is why his films look so damn good in every frame.
1989;Just to sell us a letterbox blu.
1990;There's a doc on the film, one of SK himself, ande best of all is his daughter Vivian's home movie of the making of the film, including a few priceless bits of SK telling Jack how to play a scene, and some other sweet bits of Jack horsing around backstage.
1991;Both are worth your time.
1992;It's a real treat to see it in almost.
1993;With a director as sublime as Kubrick, everything should be precisely as he wanted it.
1994;based his film on King's extraordinary novel.
1995;Jack Nicholson has natural facial expression that make him appear evil, while Shelly Duvall is mousy and plays her role in a very vanilla way.
1996;While this version has that avant guarde feeling Kubrick enjoyed.
1997;it takes place in Colorado, uses the Stanley Hotel (where King wrote the story and based the Overlook on), and King himself worked on it.
1998;The miniseries is better juxtaposed next to the book than Kubrick's, but that's just my opinion.
1999;As a stand alone movie, this one is pretty good.
2000;Overall it's a classic and worth a watch for anybody.
2001;One of my favorite movies.
2002;Even with Jack Nicholson saying Here's Johnny , this movie was really thrilling.
2003;The haunting music, from many years gone by, certainly helped too.
2004;I hope you all enjoy this.
2005;This movie is a classic.
2006;It is a must own for all movie lovers.
2007;A classic that deserves to be watched over and over again.
2008;I just love this movie.
2009;Very vintage, good lighting, good plot, very good acting.
2010;Some of Jack Nicholson's best work.
2011;Kubrick's classic psychological horror film gets better with every viewing.
2012;The eerie ambience of the Overlook Hotel, the uncanny possession of young Danny Torrence, and the mesmerizing performance by Jack Nicholson add to the spectacular cinematography and the fiendishly clever script to comprise a spellbinding film from the first to the final frame.
2013;Like fine wine the Shining gets better with age.
2014;Nicholson is great and every filmmaker should study this film more than once
2015;One can just about understand Jack Nicholson wanting to 'correct' her.
2016;Still, a good creepy ride.
2017;The Shining is simply the best horror movie ever made.
2018;diconcerting atmosphere that the movie (and the hotel) conveys is something that no other movie has ever achieved, the soundtrack is chilling, the actor's performance is perfect, the use of the steady.
2019;This is a great film.
2020;if your anyone but Stephen King your going to love this movie.
2021;It's there to help drive the story and it helps to put you in what ever mood you're supposed to be in while watching the scene.
2022;I also loved the hotel and the decor.
2023;I was excited to see it again because I finally read the book and I loved it.
2024;I definitely remember seeing that movie and it's one of my favorites.
2025;That being said, even though he disliked this movie adaptation of his book, I loved it!Kubrick created a masterpiece of horror and suspense in this movie.
2026;From the first stirrings of madness in Nicholson, to the wonderful moment when a freaked.
2027;if you haven't seen this movie yet, and are a King fan, you should love it (despite what a previous reviewer says).
2028;If you're not a King fan, you'll still love it if you're willing to let the movie work on your head, rather than do the obvious blood and guts stuff.
2029;Scream it's not, thank goodness!
2030;The book by Stephen King is also a favorite.
2031;If you haven't read the book, i recommend it.
2032;They did a great job.
2033;Jack Nicholson does some amazing acting and i was not disappointed.
2034;Great movie from a great book.
2035;Thanks to the both of you for giving the best to build upon.
2036;I watched this movie due the reviews I found here in amazon.
2037;All together it's ok movie.
2038;I have never come across such a gripping and well made film in my life.
2039;Such as Scarface it deserves 5 stars, but in terms of acting talent (other than Pacino) it is poor and the use of the camera cannot compete with the Shining, I don't think any film can compete in terms of the crispness of directing, I love the irregularity of the camera angles which typified Kubrick as a masterclass in directing, Scarface is still a fantastic film but in terms of making it good to look at .
2040;it sort of fails, but then there came The Shining, adapted from a fantastic Stephen King novel the film is a wierd tale, Jack Nicholson superbly plays Jack Torrance the winter caretaker of a hotel high in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, he is up there with his wife and his son.
2041;His son (played very well by a young Danny Lloyd) has an unusual talent, the shining.
2042;i don't think any other film anywhere has ever had so many memorable quotes nor do I think there is any other style of directing that could beat this, it is in a class of its own.
2043;Stanley Kubrick relly brings the chills and creates more suspense than you can handle, the eerie climate made is just another thing that adds to the terror and with Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Philip Stone and Scatman Crothers it is clear the film will stun and it does, it is one o the best films ever made due to the fact it has been concentrated on and developed sublimely before being given to the masses.
2044;Kubrick's legacy will always be remembered through this film.
2045;great acting, beautiful location, what's not to like?I've seen it 4 times, and counting.
2046;Stanley Kubrick created an utter masterpiece with this haunting adaptation of Stephen Kings novel (also kings best book I believe).
2047;Jack Nicholson plays the perfect psycho, very convivcing (should of won an academy award for this) The cinemotagraphy is classic kubrick, very psychological.
2048;i recommend this movie, one of the best horror movies ever adapted from a novel.
2049;Stephen King's best story, about a man, his and his son Danny go to a hotel to be the caretaker.
2050;The extras on this disc are also good, with the great Vivian Kubrick mini.
2051;documentary included, along with a pretty good audio commentary featuring Garrett Brown.
2052;this exciting inventor of the Steadicam speaks of how the film was intended to use this cinematographic camera technique in a new way, and his thoughts are pretty interesting for film historians to listen to.
2053;His contributions to Kubrick's visuals are significant here.
2054;like means and peculiar methodologies to figure out what it is that works and what it is that doesn't while shooting a picture, and thus he stripped most of his later films of their enjoyable qualities.
2055;I do like Jack Nicholson, and I am not surprised that these two guys did well together here.
2056;but he is trying to create a visual experience as opposed to a truly cerebral one, so he obviously wouldn't care about the warmth vs. cold aspect behind King's critical assessment of this adaptation.
2057;It is such a psychological thriller that I find more interesting that most horror movies that come out today.
2058;It held my interest throughout and kept me at the edge of my seat, waiting for the next surprise that this famous director had in store for the audience.
2059;Jack Nicolson and Shelly Duval star as a married couple with a six year old son who agree to be caretakers in an isolated luxury hotel during the winter months.
2060;His performance is nothing less than absolutely great and is certainly one that skyrocketed him to a fabulous career.
2061;She has unique looks with gigantic eyes that express the horrific conditions she is thrust into and I just couldn't take my eyes off her.
2062;Yes, the film was well crafted by one of the greats in the industry and the film has become a classic in every sense of the word.
2063;If you like scary movies this is a must!
2064;An old one that is still a great movie.
2065;I remember that I read the book before seeing the movie and was still scared.
2066;Great acting and special effects A lot better than the scary movies of today.
2067;This movie looks amazing in Blu.
2068;The movie has alot of beauty to it.
2069;The blood scene coming out of the doors and flooding the room is of course horror, but it also has an artsy touch to it.
2070;I just love the acting.
2071;Also some of the looks she gives when all the scary stuff is happening are priceless.
2072;Jack is great as head of the family turns demonic, but always with a comic edge.
2073;Overall, one of my favorite scary movies!
2074;Good choice of Warner to release these widescreen versions.
2075;for anyone interested in watching the film, I recommend reading Stephen Kings novel first if you really want to get scared,and yo also get to picture the characters how you want.
2076;I think that's very fun.
2077;Much of the first part of the movie has scenes of long winding roads, driving miles and miles up a mountain to a beautiful hotel.
2078;There are also scenes of a young boy riding a three.
2079;A garden maze is also featured with tall green bushes cut in at least an acre of ground that the young boy and his mother navigate as the main character seems to watch above a model inside the hotel.
2080;season job at a enormous Chalet.
2081;Jack, his wife (Shelly Duvall) and his young son (Danny Lloyd) move in for the five winter months, with the agreement to maintain the elegant hotel.
2082;Jack laughs off the possibility he will get cabin fever, he just wants to be alone to write, and this job fits his needs perfectly.
2083;With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel.
2084;The Shinning is only the most brilliant movie ever shot.
2085;Stanley Kubrick is a genius above ALL geniuses while putting this movie together.
2086;"The brilliance to cast Jack ""the man"" Nicholson!"
2087;Kubrick is the only one that can make Shelly Duvall act at all well.
2088;She did do a great job playing the role given to her.
2089;The son, Danny Lloyd, just an awesome job acting.
2090;The detail and thought gone into this movie blows me away and I've seen and known this movie for 20 years!
2091;Nothing has ever been made as brilliant.
2092;But this movie, my goodness.
2093;What A WORK OF ART!
2094;This is one of the best horror films ever and with Stanley Kubrick at the helm I can easily say it's a masterpiece of suspense!
2095;Always a classic in my book.
2096;Stanly Kubrick's The Shining is a good movie.
2097;this is a must if you want to see a good movie
2098;i enjoyed the movie very much, i enjoyed having this classic movie to my collection.
2099;Grandma, Oh, just open the door.
2100;Fun to watch a multigenerational connect!Wendy Weikal.
2101;"While it's definitely not Stanley Kubrick's best film, ""The Shining"" is a definitely good movie."
2102;The story, based on Stephen King's novel (though King hates the movie), is about the Torrance family moving to the Overlook Hotel to tend to it during the winter.
2103;The father Jack slowly begins to lose his mind and is soon chasing after his wife and son, which eventually goes outside into one of the scariest, most haunting chase scenes ever.
2104;While it doesn't really mess with your mind, it still delivers the goods and is occasionally very, very scary.
2105;line (from his classmates) so the kids laughed their way through some of the scenes .
2106;Jack Nicholson's descent into madness still rings true.
2107;The Shining is a form of telepathy that the little boy has to communicate with another world.
2108;Shelly Duvall makes a great mom and is a wonderful actress.
2109;The Shining is a true Stephen King classic horror movie.
2110;a great movie to revisit year after year.
2111;He made what, to me, is the finest film about war ( Paths Of Glory ), the finest science.
2112;fiction film ( 2001 ), one of the most intriguing films about the way society solves problems of immorality ( Clockwork Orange ) and one of the slyest films about obsession ( Lolita ) ever made.
2113;The Shining perhaps transcends genre.
2114;Neither is it a successful suspense film .
2115;She's Mrs. Cleaver and Danny is her little Beaver.
2116;many have enjoyed this film and see in it things I guess I do not.
2117;"the beginning is somewhat stilted and there are times you think someone is right next to you, nudging and winking, ""Oh, yeah, there's trouble ahead."
2118;once you get beyond that, though, the beginning is also an understated stunning opener!
2119;chilling moments abound in the film.
2120;My most notable favorite is Shelley Duvall's discovery of the hundreds of pages with the words .
2121;The hedge maze is spectacular, although it is sad that the film was made too early to make the hedge monsters a compelling reality.
2122;p>The film manages to get under your skin with Jack Nicholson's character development.
2123;and it still manages to scare, too!
2124;First of all, King is exaggerating.
2125;"The truth is, though, that Nicholson made four other films in the five years separating ""Shining"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest."
2126;In fact, I think it stands as one of the great horror movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, a very fertile time for the genre.
2127;"and on and on, really
2128;I think """"The Shining"""" is a great film."""
2129;As for me, even though I have viewed the film many times, it always gives me a fright and a thrill.
2130;Another generation loves this movie!
2131;"I bought this as a surprise for my daughter and her friends for a Halloween sleepover
2132;Always read Stephen King first, then see the movie.
2133;Scary and funny at the same time.
2134;If you like Jack Nicholson as I do you will love this thriller.
2135;There are many very funny lines in this movie.
2136;When I first saw the 'Shining',many moons ago,it captured my imagination.
2137;also about Native Americans and the various tribes.
2138;it's sheer genius,around the table.
2139;kubrick masterfully illumes the images from the darkness of hidden meanings.
2140;stephen King pens a modern horror classic.
2141;kubrick,King and Nicholson all collaborated their element and it clicked.

2157;The Shining is by far the greatest horror film of all time.
2158;So I thought I'd take a look at The Shining.
2159;Part of what gave The Shining it's charm was it's washed.
2160;The Shining is Stanley Kurbrik's movie adaption of Stephen King's novel.
2161;The story is about Jack Torrance and his family taking care of the OverLook Hotel for the winter.
2162;jack and his wife Wendy look forward to go to such a large hotel and have it for themselves.
2163;The reason for this is Danny has ESP, that has to do with seeing some past events in the form of images.
2164;The hotel has a very powerful effect on him, by allowing him to see ghosts.
2165;But he does see past events, for what he tells Danny in the kitchen of the hotel.
2166;I felt the isolation also got to Jack, unlike Wendy and Danny.
2167;I liked the ending a lot.
2168;It's simple, but the last shot gives it all.
2169;the camera angles and the hotel itself give a lot of the mood of the movie.
2170;My favorite is the Golden Ball room with it's high ceiling.
2171;But you will get more of the sides.
2172;disc 2 features the making of the Shining, all by Stanley's daughter's.
2173;She uses the camera to show how the movie was made.
2174;Capturing the working of the actors, and showing Stanley's directing to them.
2175;The Shining is a classic.
2176;Stanley Kubrick is always going to be one of the greatest Directors there is !!!
2177;Jack Nicholson has given a shivering performance which haunts you even after days of watching the film !
2178;Although good, it's nowhere as this suspense thriller brilliantly directed by the late Stanley Kubrick, and even more brilliantly starred by Jack Nicholson.
2179;a concierge, and his wife and kid are bound to spend the wort part of the winter at a mountain resort all by themselves.
2180;There is a 'legend' that such a task in the past drove a previous concierge crazy.
2181;one final piece of advice: see it until the final titles are over.
2182;I really loved this movie.
2183;This movie and Batman are my 2 favorites of JACK's.
2184;it's always good to have a shot of Jack Daniels at the bar,even if there's no liquor in the whole Hotel.
2185;The opening scene showing the landscape going to the Overlook is breath taking.
2186;One of Mr. Nicholson's best performances.
2187;Jack Nicholson does an awsome acting job in this one.
2188;much better than the remake for tv a couple of years ago/Must see.
2189;ray version of this film is the best I've seen it in years!
2190;more clarity, depth, and richness of color.
2191;ray version is highly recommended.
2192;I'll keep it because it's Kubrick, but I'll wait for the day when a definitive edition comes out.
2193;A Absolute master piece, i love this film, it has just the right amount of scare factor and ghostly haunting.
2194;Amazing acting by Jack Nicholson, but they could of done better then Olive Oil.
2195;this is one of the best horror movies ever and one of Kubrick's best movies.
2196;It was the scariest movie I had ever seen.
2197;He brings his wife Wendy(Duvall) and his psychic son Danny(Lloyd).
2198;Hallorann also warns Danny about the hotel and Room 237.
2199;"Grady tells Jack that Danny is using his ""shining"" against him and Jack turns against his family."
2200;The Shining is easily one of the best Horror movies ever made.
2201;has a great supporting cast: Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson, and Philip Stone.
2202;I think that Scatman Crothers won a Best Supporting Actor Award.
2203;This movie tops other scary movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street(pretty good), Friday the 13th, and Scream(another good slasher) Overall, this movie gets an A+!
2204;But to be a dope man well.
2205;And one of those pennants on a stick with a big letter Y.
2206;Classic Horror film holds up well.
2207;The thriller of all times in my opinion.
2208;This is my favorite Stephen King book turned movie.
2209;I really liked this verion but I watched the mini.
2210;absolutly perfect it got here in a great time period and works perfectly!
2211;Jack's son can read minds and sense ghosts, which comes in handy because the hotel is filled with ghosts and supernatural beings.
2212;During their stay at this haunted hotel, the family is constantly scared by ghosts of people that were murdered in the hotel.
2213;this movie is absolutely fantastic though.
2214;There is so many hidden symbolic messages within most of the film.
2215;jack Nicholson's acting is spot on perfect
2216;The Shining is one of my favorite Kubrick films and probably one of my favorite films in general.
2217;This is what makes the movie so affecting.
2218;Because the film seems to happen so.
2219;This movie once again shows Stanley Kubrick's skill for completely re.
2220;thinking a film genre, and still making a great movie.
2221;The Shining is a very eerie film with plenty of psycological twists that will leave you asking questions for days.
2222;If you keep an open mind throughout this movie, then you will absolutely LOVE it.
2223;great date movie as well, it scares women so that's a plus as you are there to protect them!
2224;Great set too, they built that hotel I believe.
2225;The plot for this movie is just the top layer.
2226;If you thought this movie was decent back in the day and have not seen it in a while, give it another try.
2227;This film does what I love horror films to do: rather than trying to shock and startle the viewer (although it does do a little of that) it instead gradually builds a sense of unease.
2228;A true classic, darkly funny and bizarre.
2229;I recommend it for fans of horror.
2230;I'm a fan of this one, and I'm a fan of the novel.
2231;Kubrick wants to be a genius.
2232;Kubrick excels in such excess.
2233;That scene makes me laugh every time I see it.
2234;see it once, to be sure, but even the 1997 made for TV remake does a much better job of telling a story.
2235;Come play with us for ever and ever.
2236;The video/audio on this Digitally restored and remastered edition are simply amazing.
2237;The Shining (1980) is in every way an epic horror classic that really just gets under your skin.
2238;But I will share my feelings on it and what the impact of watching it is like.
2239;The Shining could almost be called a cinematic perfect storm with so many factors combining together that worked out so advantageously.
2240;the first is Stephen King's novella, which this adaptation is one of the few to actually do justice to, the second is director Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision and the third, of course, is Jack Nicholson's frighteningly intense, tour.
2241;Ordinarily in most of his movies, it's fun to watch the always larger.
2242;Almost 30 years later, this horror epic still packs a potent punch.
2243;Definitely one that stays with you and one you don't want to ideally watch by yourself!Even as an adult, to this day and beyond, this movie still gives me the creeps.
2244;This is one of the classic horror films.
2245;While I am NOT a fan of the horror genre, the acting by Jack Nicholson is outstanding.
2246;One of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces featuring the incomparable Jack Nicholson, the story itself is well known so I'll not dwell on it, this particular edition with the bonus disk featuring some out takes and production notes is a treasure.
2247;The movie really doesn't do the location justice but it gives you a glimpse of the grandeur, the hotel itself comes with plenty of supernatural tales in it's own right and management takes full advantage of this in a very artistic manner.
2248;com once again delivers the goods exactly as represented and three days ahead of schedule and at an outstanding value, Thank You!
2249;Stanley Kubrick has created some of the most visionary, superb titles in the movie kingdom in terms of creativity and observation.
2250;I enjoyed the movie every bit .
2251;"we are lead to a ""scary"" exuberant scene where the wife has a knife, and Mr. Johnny sticks his head up to the door."
2252;B.) This movie is frighteningly unscary.
2253;here's another prime example: The scene where Jack enters the bathroom to find a beautiful naked woman prime for his sexual pleasures.
2254;Face the camera in front of the woman as though the audience is looking through Jack's eyes, and then have the woman look up with blood filled black eyes, and have her snap at the camera like a wild beast (putting the audience in a disturbing position).
2255;"You'll be watching two characters on the screen just talking, but the ""scary"" music is constantly playing to suggest we are looking through the eyes of the wife, and we are feeling as though at any second Jack could crack into a million pieces."
2256;Stop wining, and do something!
2257;He can see what happens before it happens.
2258;overall, an interesting movie to debate about.
2259;the first positive thing I will say, is that some of the opening scenes, and the scenery around the Outlook Hotel, is crisp and so gorgeous in High Definition.
2260;The opening shots, when the camera is tracking the car driving up the mountains, is absolutely amazing.
2261;jack playing funnily enough Jack, is amazing.
2262;"His portrayal of Jack slowly descending into madness (""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"") makes you keep watching the movie, since he's in pretty much nearly every scene."
2263;There is a couple of times I have to look away from the screen .
2264;especially one of his last scenes in the movie when he's frozen.
2265;Stanley Kubrick's patented overuse of steadicam and wide angle lens keeps us so much away from the story and the horror that we're never engrossed totally.
2266;I know many peopl will think that this movie is a little bit freakish and uninteresting, but in many ways it is an ultimate classic movie, jack nicholson especially plays the psycho.
2267;man really well and shelley duvall's overdramatised performance ghelps to create the atmosphere.
2268;Kubrick is a great director, and for the time, some great directing going on there .
2269;Ten thumbs up for this horro/thriller classic.
2270;Jack loved his wife and child .
2271;well this movie will have you in suspense the whole time .
2272;really makes you think what isolation and being stranded will do to the human mind really great movie .
2273;"rays, I can say that ""The Shining"" is the most surprising."
2274;I saw this in the theatre when it came out, and it was nice to finally have it in the widescreen format again.
2275;It fills the 16X9 screen entirely.
2276;I can't recommend this one any higher!
2277;I remember seeing the movie when it first came out thirty years ago, and the opening shots of the car driving through the mountains still impress me.
2278;"matte"" 4x3, as all of Stanley Kubrick's pre."
2279;filling widescreen image, but the more.
2280;angle lense compositions, particularly inside the hedge.
2281;"framed, as we are drawn into the world of madness and homicide that Nicholson's Jack Torrence character descends into, along with his family, his wife Wendy, hysterics properly protrayed by Shelly Duvall, and his son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd, who possesses the psychic ""gift"" of The Shining, where he can see the future and the horrific past of the Overlook Hotel and its demons."
2282;greater detail that cuts to the bone, as well as various roaring '20s artists, in spectacular stereo with rear detail.
2283;This remains the quintessential Stanley Kubrick classic, visually immaculate, with a story as twisted and disturbing as only Stanley (with the help of author Stephen King here) could muster.
2284;It's The Shining, Jack Nicholson at his best.
2285;Well, he was always at his best.
2286;Stanley Kurbick in an amazing director and you can not beat the acting of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.
2287;One of his fave movies all time!
2288;And, although it doesn't follow true to the book, I love watching this movie.
2289;IMHO, this is Nicholson's best movie.
2290;This Kubrick film on Blu Ray is just superb!
2291;The music is remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1 and is just amazing.
2292;"I've now seem all the Kubrick films on Blu Ray except for ""Full Metal Jacket"" and this is one of the very best (with ""2001"" being the ultimate home video ever!)"
2293;I could go on and on about the film, which has NEVER looked this good, even upon it's initial release.
2294;kubrick's attention to detail and the fact that this is a masterpiece of set design, cinematography and lighting.
2295;The entire Overlook hotel was built inside a soundstage in England and shot with existing light.
2296;hopefully that will be coming up in high def).
2297;it is a stunningly superb transfer to digital and should bring a whole new generation to this incredible achievement.
2298;widescreen film looked this good, perhaps I could live without it!!!
2299;He's almost absent from his documentary!
2300;The documentary alone is worth the price, especially since this is the only depiction of Kubrick at work that we have.
2301;ray is awesome and the extras are great.
2302;Lengthy interviews and behind the scenes information is great to have.
2303;The mood is edge of your seat Shelly Duvall is Olive Oil on steroids!
2304;The book is always better.
2305;If you're heart is still beating from being chased through a garden maze, you definitely won't need a difibulator any time soon.
2306;Excellent movie if you like being scared out of your wits!
2307;"This is a ""must have"" as far as classics go."
2308;It's best viewed in the dark, perhaps on a cold winter night.
2309;Those are just some of the elements that make this such a terrific horror film.
2310;Jack Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly descending into madness is amazing.
2311;The child that played Danny is fantastic.
2312;"The eerie music, snowstorm, the sound of the winds howling outside
2313;The Shining or Blade Runner is my best favorite piece.
2314;You are unable to see all of splendid picture including the helicopter shadow above the forest in the first credit.
2315;The forest is the forest in the last credit of Blade Runner that is Kubrick's present.
2316;We have now strong BD power.
2317;for Audiophiles there is a new 5.1 track as opposed to the mono you got on the previous release.
2318;The beginning score when Jack is driving to the Overlook hotel is amazing cranked up with a Dolby digital plus track in 5.1.
2319;the transfer on this is beautiful.
2320;the Shining is the greatest Stephen King film adapation and is one, if not the greatest of all horror films.
2321;Also one of the greatest films for any genre and right in time for Halloween you can't go wrong.
2322;i'll go more in depth of the special features as I watch them.
2323;Sure, it's always been a hypnotic movie, for 28 years now, but I've never seen it look so breathtaking.
2324;The Shining ranks with the Exorcist as being one of the best horror films of all time.
2325;The casting of Scatman,to my mind, was, along with the casting of Nicholson, sheer genius.
2326;From the spinechilling music playing during the first frames of the movie as the car winds up to thehotel to the very last frame as the 20s themed music plays and the camera zeros in onNicholson's figure at the center of the black and white photograph, the movie delivers.
2327;stephen King purists can argue all they want over how true the film stayed to the book.
2328;i'm a King fan through and through, and I believe Kubrick's version is outstanding.
2329;This is one of best horror movies I have ever watched.
2330;It is well done story and had fatalistic actors.
2331;Kubrick's expert crafting of shocker.
2332;films has been well known for years"
2333;Climactic moments that rely on the sets are the maze chase between Jack and his PSI.
2334;cursed son, and the corresponing sub.
2335;what Scatman Crothers was doing in a flick like this is beyond me, but Nicholson and Duvall along with the undercredited son Lloyd, show true talent, and dish out the chills and thrills with the slight of a stroke of lipstick (((REDRUM))).
2336;nicholson's hacking of the bathroom door with his axe is one of the most memorable cinematic moments brought to the big.
2337;and audiences everywhere are still screaming.
2338;finally, one can thank the gore department for keeping in balane with the plotline.
2339;if you don't jump out of your seat to go throw up, you'll at least get some serious goosebumps and chills.
2340;'Carrie' holds truer to it's book than this one.
2341;Give Stan a break, please.
2342;The plotline is of course, dramatically simplified, but that's half the fun.
2343;inducing thrillers, and enjoy the talent of Jack Nicholson, you've met your match.
2344;Saw it, loved it, now I own it,.
2345;I'll make it short and sweet.
2346;Great cast, Jack Nicholson is downright amazing in this movie.
2347;I love it, I always will and if you get It I Know you will too :) redrum!
2348;One of the great horror films.
2349;Jack Nicholson is great the Steven King script is great and Kubric's directing is great.
2350;I loved the film and I stayed at the Stanley Hotel where it was filmed and that too was a great experience.
2351;I believe this is one of Kings scariest works.
2352;Acting is excellent and plot kicks.
2353;A suspense classic and excellant psychological thiller.
2354;Shelley Duvall and Jack Nickolson's performances are stellar in this movie.
2355;I'd never seen The Shining before and must say it's a fun, beautifully shot movie.
2356;I'd recommend any student of cinema or general film fan watch this.
2357;Great choice for Halloween or winter slumber party.
2358;Super scary scene with Shelley Duvall opening a gallon can of fruit cocktail and sloshing it into a serving bowl!!!
2359;He gives a beautiful and disturbing performance as a man slipping into insanity.
2360;I throughly enjoyed the plot.
2361;This disc will feature an enhanced audio/video track for the feature film.
2362;Everyone always states that as if it is so surprising.
2363;There is a great story about Kubrick calling up Stephen King at 3 am and asking him 'Do you believe in God' and when King said yes, Kubrick said 'I thought so' and hung up.
2364;(Verdi excelled at this also, only not films) Also it is to your best interest to laugh a lot when you watch this film.
2365;It is one of the funniest movies ever, and if you don't appreciate the humor, you'll never be scrared of the film.
2366;Kubrick enjoyed finishing his films, and then drastically cutting them.
2367;An interesting note: the average ratio of film shot to film kept for a film is about 1:5 to 1:10.
2368;Also, in the words of Stephen King, Kubrick liked to make films that hurt people.
2369;it's a very good observation
2370;I am happy to finally own it.
2371;I had nightmares about this movie because he's so thrilling and frightening.
2372;There aren't any werewolves, witches, ghosts, or phantasms, but it has to be one of the scariest, suspenseful movies I've ever seen so far.
2373;Classic horror film starring jackie boy, and to this day some parts are still funny.
2374;I never get tired of this movie, jack nicholson is one of my favorite actors of all time.
2375;i found myself looking at my watch way to many times as the film wore on and on.
2376;I love this movie, its a classic at its best.
2377;The twins at the end of the hall is the best.
2378;This is a great horror movie, no one can deny that.
2379;Great, great movie and everyone should definitely see it, but in my opinion I like the TV series version better.
2380;I think it was a little more believable, and I love the Stanley Hotel.
2381;Watch both and decide for yourself, they both are great horror movies.
2382;Kubrick really captured the creepy atmosphere of the place.
2383;Telling the story of Jack Torrance's rapid descent into madness and homicidal impulses towards his family as they look after the Overlook Hotel during the winter, it's very effective in telling its story.
2384;Seeing ghosts and growing more and more unhinged, Jack's character is perfectly balanced by that of his son Danny, who has 'the shining', a rare gift which allows him psychic powers and an insight into the history of the creepy hotel.
2385;as the lead character, Jack Nicholson is about as close to perfect as you can possibly be, and in such a movie it would be easy to solely concentrate on him.
2386;eyed performance is masterful, implying not only innocence and vulnerability but also the cold determination to protect her son.
2387;The boy who plays Danny is also immensely talented in a role today that would seem tailor.
2388;The grim and gory hallucination and psychic vision scenes are genuinely horrific, in particular the woman who rises from the bathtub only for Jack to realise that she's dead.
2389;This is generally regarded as one of Kubrick's best films, and it probably is.
2390;It's original, scary, disturbing and brilliantly acted.
2391;Instead I'm going to review the extra features.
2392;I thought it was a concise, well done look behind.
2393;scenes with a lot of interesting trivia and interviews.
2394;I enjoyed hearing her stories.
2395;She had the unique perspective of being a 17 year old bystander on the set.
2396;This is an interesting look at the musical sequences that didn't make it into the final cut of The Shining and Clockwork Orange.
2397;disc 1 special features .
2398;The steadycam operator was humorous to listen to and he also keeps you interested because of his unique perspective as a crew member on set almost every day during filming.
2399;I would have enjoyed it more listening to a second person who had actually been there during filming.
2400;I'm happy with my choice.
2401;"a five star movie, but only a four star ""special"" edition."
2402;"personally, I prefer the 2001 disc
2403;a second disc has three new featurettes, which are interesting as far as they go, but nothing particularly illuminating or special.
2404;Ironically, the fourth ' Special Feature' on this second disc, is the best by far .
2405;Vivian Kubrick's masterful documentary on her father's film, which was previously on the 2001 edition.
2406;He uses the mental breakdown of his subjects to draw us in to his eerie vision.
2407;The book is better than the film but the film itself is far more satisfying.
2408;I think that certain aspects of the script are so well written and Jack Nicholsons performance is A1.
2409;The film was shot in 4'3 so you are getting the full picture aspect and you see even more than the cinema version which was cropped at the top and bottom.
2410;The picture has been restored suitably enough and shows a gritty image the same as Aliens did.
2411;The picture is fine and I cant imagine it ever looked this good before.
2412;There is the novel by Stephen King, and then there is the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring the phychotic superman Jack Nicholson.
2413;Great filmaker, but a prick.
2414;One step at a time he goes bonkers.
2415;Stepping away from the Stephen King version, you gotta love The Shining.
2416;Jack Nicholson is awesome as everyone's favorite lunatic.
2417;The Shining has it all.
2418;and remember: Wendy, darling, light of my life!
2419;I'm gonna bash 'em right the f*ck in!Dig it!
2420;This Kubrik directed adaption of the Stephen King novel is actually better than the book in my opinion.
2421;The soundtrack also sets the mood and helps contribute to the gripping pace.
2422;the young actor who plays Doc is excellent.
2423;The scenes between him and Jack Nicholson early in the film are so touching.
2424;The boy has such a maturity about him that is really amazing.
2425;shelley Duvall as well is such a fine actress, she is very underrated.
2426;scatman Crothers is incredible and serves as a catalyst to get the story to the next level.
2427;This man is one of our more talented actors and plays this role about as over the top as you can get.
2428;this is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again and still see something new to enjoy.
2429;It is a complete American masterpiece.
2430;Best horror movie of all time.
2431;And my favorite Jack Nicholson movie.
2432;Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint in this film.
2433;stanley Kubrick creates a beautiful looking film which takes on greater meaning with repeat viewings.
2434;Kubrick is a master of film making, and with this film he was able to prove that horror could be just as artful as other films.
2435;The Shining is a classic and should not be missed!
2436;I hadn't ever had the pleasure of seeing the Shining up until a couple of years ago.
2437;It is hinted at that he has his share of demons that he is trying to escape.
2438;jack's son Danny is a special little boy who has psychic abilities, and the hotel wants him on its side.
2439;and her husband?The Shining is impressive on quite a few levels: there is an atmosphere of tension throughout the whole movie that really draws you in, the casting is excellent, wonderful performances are turned in by all, and though it was released in 1980 and the clothing and styles are definitely from that time, the picture holds up admirably, rarely feeling dated.
2440;This is a picture that a lot of the more recent horror/suspense films could learn something from.
2441;if you've got any interest in being scared or you just want to see a really well.
2442;made film, watch the Shining.
2443;A great horror movie, and in my opinion the second best ever(second to Halloween).
2444;Filled with and thrills and plenty of chill, the Shining is sure to creep you out.
2445;I recommend it to anyone.
2446;It has a behind the scenes documentary in the special edition.
2447;The best scene in the movie is with the killer Dell Grady(Philip Stone) and Nicholson.
2448;Director: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Shelley Duvall Jack Nicholson and Scatman Corrutthers
2449;Wow!That's my lasting impression of Stanley Kubrick's complete Masterpiece of Psychological Terror.
2450;jack Nicholson was amazing in a role NO ONE ELSE could have played.
2451;But the real star of this movie is THE OVERLOOK HOTEL.
2452;Kubrick's amazing use of the camera adds to the eerie,isolated and extremely spooky setting.
2453;The result is a psychological drama that is, in a word.
2454;I read this book long after I saw the movie, the book was good, but the movie is better.
2455;A totally hypnotic tour de force by one of history's most underrated directors and genius minds.
2456;Next to THE EXORCIST, this is the best horror movie I've ever seen.
2457;The book was better, but the movie is good too
2458;If you like to be scared, this is the movie for you.
2459;With great cinematography, and a soundtrack that builds unrelenting tension, you might want to leave the lights on for this one.
2460;Yeah it had a few pieces out of the book and that was it.
2461;If it would have had more of the book in it I would have enjoyed it a lot better.
2462;Throughout Kubrick's creative life as a filmmaker he was drawn to using pre.
2463;The music by the three composers aforementioned are well established and parts of the contemporary orchestral repertoire, and were written with no connection what so ever to Stanley Kubrick's film.
2464;that this work exists successfully in itself in its own right.
2465;It sounds very much like an ordinary successful film score with the usual subliminal and emotional effect that a composed score is designed to produce.
2466;Though not a popular piece of classical music it is one which a good many people would be familiar with.
2467;It is a masterpiece of 20th century musical composition.
2468;Bartok's music has a particular sound world which comprises a number of elements, particularly in the third movement of this piece which is a fine example of what is known as his Night Music .
2469;The Night Music often made up the intense slow movements of his most important works, particularly his string quartets, regular features of which are atmospheric special effects produced by string instruments (Glissandi, Pizzicato, Harmonics and Tremolos) which contribute to a feeling of dreamlike unreality.
2470;It is likely that Kubrick was drawn to this expression of psychological darkness as part of his creative process.
2471;Ligeti and Penderecki have also developed the use of these musical techniques in their own work using Bartok as an antecedent thus making their music relevant and organic as the score to this film.
2472;The composition of a film score is normally the very last creative part of a project.
2473;A film composer would compose music timed, frame by frame, second by second, to an existing edited version of the completed film, which impose particular limitations upon the artists creative expression.
2474;It is likely that Nicholson and Duvall would have familiarised themselves with the music in order to better time certain actions and lines and rehearsed intensely in order to achieve the precision required.
2475;The whole general effect of these techniques is one of precision and power and must certainly have been a fundamental element of Kubrick's entire creative process in this project.
2476;It was a unique and original way of working with film.
2477;The emergence of the ghostly nude woman from the bath in room 237 to Penderecki's music is a particularly fine example of this choreography.
2478;Kubrick's choices, understanding and directional mastery with regards to the music make these techniques absolutely successful in their effect.
2479;The music chosen has a surrealism all of its own.
2480;When it is heard the viewer knows that something supernatural is about to develop.
2481;The narrative steps out of reality and enters its own dream world.
2482;Kubrick owes a debt to the genius of his composers.
2483;Every element of the film is superb: the cinematography, the acting, the pacing, the music.
2484;A perfect example of flim at its finest.
2485;Well i loved this movie when he chopped his way through the door and said heres johnny the freaked me ouot and when he was locked in the celler and was like go check it out that sounded really funny the way he said it, i like died of laughter!
2486;and we have a more dramatic ending than the book with Jack running with an axe across the hotel trying to cut Danny in thousand pieces, that's entertainment.
2487;also we have Shelley, which was more scary and effective than the hotel's ghosts, and even Jack himself.
2488;kubrick did his Job, and left us this masterpiece that will be enjoyed forever and ever and ever.
2489;haunted hotel with a horrific history that plays out to be the caretakers present reality, is an amazing (not to mention Lovecraftian) but simple plot which director Stanley Kubrick brings to life in this 1980 masterpiece.
2490;jack Nicholson does an awesome job in this movie(what else do you expect from Jack?)
2491;The acting from all of the actors was above par and worth noting.
2492;But what really grabs you is the feeling that you get from the house and settings in the movie.
2493;What you get is a chilling desprate and despared haunted house in which portrays the emptiness of the main characters in this film.
2494;Kubrick never learned how to make a great horror film.
2495;But the little documentary on the making of it, filmed by Kubrick's dauhgter, is a rare occasion to see the master film maker at work.
2496;Kubrick is a genius, no doubt about that.
2497;I think this is Kubrick's last great movie.
2498;Jack Nicholson is great in his role, and I do believe they got the timing right when he goes crazy.
2499;Shelly Duvall is perfect for the scared mother, and the images are very disturbing.
2500;What I really like about director Stanley Kubrick is how original his works are!
2501;I could easily classify is style as a genre!
2502;If you liked Full Metal Jacket or 2001: A Space Odyssey, you have to check this one out, it's essential!
2503;Every time I watch this movie it amazes me how well it was made and how scary it is.
2504;Amazingly shot, completely atmospheric, and tremendously acted.
2505;The last twenty minutes alone are well the worth the price of admission.
2506;But there's another two hours to the movie, and thankfully, they are equally as enjoyable.
2507;There is a lot of internal dialogue that can't be expressed and I accept that.
2508;But you still get to watch the young boy struggle and you want to help him, you really do.
2509;The mother's reaction is believable.
2510;And the end, good stuff.
2511;and it was just as good for me as the first time.
2512;I watch this movie every Halloween.
2513;It is my favorite horror movie.
2514;The young boy who plays Danny in this movie does an excellent job of blanking out of this world and into the world of his visions.
2515;He makes this extraordinary power of his seem very believable.
2516;Also, I thought showing Jack in the 1920's picture in the hotel at the ending was a nice touch that was not in the book.
2517;This is a classic must watch for any true horror movie fan, not the type that just likes the pointless slasher flicks like Friday the 13th.
2518;Even though this is not Stephen King's favorite version of his book, this movie is still a great classic full of drama and suspense.
2519;The hotel itself is the star of this movie though, and the cinemotography is top notch.
2520;This movie version stands better on its own than as an adaptation of the novel.
2521;Watch it and develop your own.
2522;Great story, superb cast (especially the diabolic nicholson).
2523;Still watching the movie after all these years (i have em on tape) and i'm still enjoying the scene's like it's the first time i watch em.
2524;Anyone who likes horror flicks has this in their collection.
2525;A real scary story this movie follows a man(Jack Nicholson) and his family as they care for a beautiful hotel in the mountains.
2526;The dolby digital aspect is ok mostly music comes from the rear and voices in the front.
2527;I still dream about those two small girls at night.
2528;the novel uses traditional narrative tools of written fiction .
2529;as you'd expect: we are led into a complex story through richly drawn characters whose dilemma is examined through metaphor and figurative structure.
2530;King's outstanding achievement was to deliver such intellectual richness in the context of such a barnstorming yarn.
2531;What we are left with is beautiful cinematography, disconcerting camera angles, a complex sound stage and high.
2532;There are fine set pieces, but Kubrick seems almost deliberately to defuse the thrills, even down to the constant bright lighting with which he floods his sets.
2533;I was left with the sense that the Shining is a dated film, perhaps more an artefact of its time than a genuinely great film.
2534;It's easy to see why Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick clashed over Kubrick's version of The Shining .
2535;time civil rights supporter, I was pleased they both exerted efforts that are usually beyond the ability of the human mind and body to accomplish .
2536;A really great effect is reproduced from King's novel: the dead .
2537;who is Danny's real informant of danger as part of Danny's shining and having Danny's thumb .
2538;all that said, The Shining is an extremely frightening film.
2539;There are still T. shirts bearing a close.
2540;crothers is fine, fine, fine as the departing hotel chef, who notices and tells Danny about his shine, and tells him to use it if he needs help, because Crothers will come back if he does.
2541;Kubrick tarnished the shining of one of the best and certainly one of the most graphic haunted house genre stories ever written.
2542;hey there, this movies one of the greatest movies i've ever seen, the shooting, the acting, the music, the story and the production everythings just great.
2543;I have read Stephen King's novel and I strongly prefer Kubrick's version of the story.
2544;two elements make this an essential film.
2545;First, I beleive this movie displays Jack Nicholson at his absolute best (however,all the actors in this movie do an incredible job).
2546;Secondly, Kubrick's films are both beautiful and effective.
2547;Just like any other Kubrick film, you sit back and take in the wonderful sets, acting, camera work, lighting, and dialogue.
2548;For me, all Stanley Kubrick movies are a must.
2549;night in theatre and it still gives me a good rush.
2550;Kubrick meets Nicholson and the advent of the award winning cinematography technology .
2551;He is also writing a book.
2552;Nicholson does a great job of going insane and then absolutely crackers in the end.
2553;Okay he got the shot, but he forgot entirely about the script and what makes a movie tick.
2554;Shelley Duvall is the most clich d driven character you will ever see.
2555;The other 113 minutes is sheer nothingness as people see a few ghosts and just visit places in the hotel.
2556;This is one of the best.
2557;The film looks new, with such a sharp image and brilliant colors that you'd never guess it was almost 30 years old.
2558;In watching this movie for the 2nd time after not really caring much for it the first time, I enjoyed Jack's campy portrayal of a deranged killer.
2559;After seeing Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets I found out what a great actor he is so I decided to give The Shining another chance.
2560;My favorite part is when Jack as Jack Torrence mimics and makes fun of his wife after she reads the manuscript with the same sentence repeated and she is scared of him.
2561;What I like about The Shining video version I bought is that before the actual film starts there is a documentary about the making of The Shining filmed by Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian.
2562;There is a touching moment when Scatman Crothers is interviewed.
2563;Since I had seen The Shining before I saw Cuckoo's Nest in the past I didn't realize this was the second time for he and Jack to work together I thought it so neat to see him working with Jack again.
2564;If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and even if you're not I recommend this movie.
2565;If your into this kind of flick I highly recommend adding this to your collection of flicks.
2566;He loved the book and loves this movie.
2567;The Shining remains one of the best horror films ever made to date and there are several reasons why.
2568;While Shelley is generally annoying, Danny is cute and well acted, and Jack is demented enough to steal every scene he's in.
2569;alcoholic descending rapidly into madness is legendary.
2570;Duvall exhibits sheer terror to perfection"
2571;The contrast between the strong and neurotic hubby and the uncertain, reluctant wife creates a deeper impact when the final showdown begins.
2572;"The addition of the outside maze was nonesuch
2573;Instead of having the movie full of music every step of the way we have an eerie sense of silence"
2574;When music is played it's perfect.
2575;"the concept of having the shining as a unique, psychic like gift was neat
2576;The directing was superb"
2577;all of this movie is a piece of art rather than simply fiction, beautifully unleashing a tragic and brutal story of a powerful, cryptic haunting that had always been there but was just waiting to be let out.
2578;This is possibly the greatest horror movie of all time.
2579;There is a lot of detail without being overblown, and there's Jack Nicholson.
2580;The acting is superb, espeically the typewriter scene.
2581;Amazing movie, one of a kind.
2582;Having read The Shining, and been in turns moved to laughter, tears and of course, terror, I was prepared for a powerful movie.
2583;Jack Nicholson, a fine actor, proved himself to be a USDA Grade One Ham, with his slobbering, capering immediate descent into evil.
2584;He was the most strong, dignified character in the book.
2585;"The chase scene at the end in the maze would have been a clever touch in another movie
2586;But it is all worth it, for director Stanley Kubrick jams a ton of information into this film with a great end result.
2587;the plot can be summed up quite easily.
2588;There are strong insinuations that the hotel is seriously haunted and that the spirits that lie within have taken hold of Jack's mind.
2589;There are lots of events that can sway you either way, so it's hard to tell.
2590;What is important is that they establish an unsettling mood.
2591;Of less regard I feel is the credit due to the Overlook itself.
2592;It suits the story perfectly with its maze.
2593;like floor plan, cavernous rooms and hallways, and overall engaging architecture.
2594;kubrick put a great deal of thoughtful work into this film, and it deserves to be examined.
2595;Every shot, every scene is well thought out and the result is a film that doesn't ever go overboard, but also gives you enough information to get its point across.
2596;Fact is, the movie slowly builds to its fantastic ending because it wouldn't have worked any other way.
2597;Every bit he gives us we add to an already rising tension about what is going to happen next, until of coarse Jack flips entirely.
2598;the Shining will be sure to entertain, but it is also thought provoking.
2599;It's the kind of movie that has a lot going on in the background and this will allow you to draw your own conclusions as to what this movie is trying to say and just what it all means.
2600;Jack Nicholson is one my favorite actors (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,A Few Good Men,Anger Management and his latest coming soon,The Bucket Trip).
2601;He delivers a solid performance as the caretake along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd).
2602;A good beginning but the action picks up when cabin fever begins to set in on Mr. Torrance and, well, you have to find out for yourself.
2603;i first saw the shining when i was about 13 at this age it scared me senseless but still i found the film throughly enjoyable.
2604;This film is without doubt the best film made.
2605;This is the scariest, as well as one of the wierdest movies I have ever seen.
2606;this movie ranks up in the top five of scary movies of all time.
2607;it is just a great movie.you can watch over and over
2608;I loved this movie it is one of the best horror movies out there today.
2609;It had it all horror/shock/supence and a good look in to the human mind and what happens to some people when locked up in a house together and that feeling of lonelyness and isulatetion.
2610;this one of the best films ever made.
2611;classic classic everbody should watch this once in awhile a must see
2612;This is a great movie and the scariest one I have ever seen.
2613;Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson give great performances as Jack and Wendy Torrance.
2614;Visually and aurally this movie reminds us of the magic that exist """"Out There""""."""
2615;It's a funhouse ride that leads you along with vistas of gradeur and reminders of life's unexplainables.
2616;"A unique treat that illustrates life's moments of beautiful strangness, ""The Shining"" haunts you and grips you deep, delivering as rich an experience as one could want from a movie."
2617;Not my favorite Kubrick film, but a pretty good spook flick nevertheless.
2618;All in all, just great, in Cinematography and screenwriting.
2619;I would also like to say thatI think that the conclusion of this film is far superior than that of the novel, and far scarier.
2620;I'm a lover of the climactic ending.
2621;It's so funny how Andy Sands is bent on negatively reviewing this great film and then he has the nerve to compare it to Gremlins 2.
2622;More entertaining in light of seeing Room 237.
2623;It is truly a must see.
2624;Because of its classic nature it does deserve a fist hand look.
2625;This move has lots of exciting parts.
2626;Additional members of the cast include Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Barry Nelson.
2627;Film uses supernatural powers as an explanation for childhood disorders like autism.
2628;I love King, and had to reread this before reading the sequel .
2629;but what scares me most about this movie every time I see it (once a year at least) is that I find myself sitting with a grin on my face amusing myself as the Jack.
2630;character crosses the border, and becomes more and more and more insane.
2631;"Jack Nicholson carrying the movie with his strong and amazing acting, while the actress behind ""his"" wife, Shelley Duvall, gives an impressive and intense performance as well."
2632;Some scenes involving all the actors here are legendary.
2633;Fantastic movie and forever to be a classic!
2634;While I've never cared for the way some of his films are acted neccessarily, I've always loved the way they've looked and the way the make you feel.
2635;This makes Kubrick a suitable fit for the horror genre.
2636;The Shining, to me, has always been the ideal horror film, taking familiar horror elements to a new level.
2637;while the film strays quite a bit from its source material, the ideal ingredients for the horror to take shape are there .
2638;the real star of this film is the camera though.
2639;The best shots in this film occur when Danny is in the hallway.
2640;The classic shot that haunts me to this day is when Danny is riding his tricycle through the hallway revealing the forever eerie twin sisters.
2641;Add to that the tense score by Wendy Carlos and you have an unforgettable horror masterpiece.
2642;Both King's novel and Kubrick's film are creative powerhouses.
2643;The best little nugget here?
2644;In Kubrick's film this star part is treated more appropriately, and results in one of the best stare down scenes on film, beautifully shot and expertly acted.
2645;regardless of some content discarded from King's work, Kubrick certainly caught King's vibe.
2646;The scene in the novel with Danny playing in the snow and sensing the ghost of the little boy isn't in this film, but it assuredly found its way into Kubrick's inspiration.
2647;That he expounded on this and transmuted the story into a creative vehicle of his own should not be regarded as a slight to Stephen King or his novel.
2648;Rather, it should be seen as an example of how a great story can be capable of inspiring a great variation.
2649;i'm a big stephan king so i watch this every holiday season its a family thing.
2650;By far, one of the best horror films ever made, Stanley Kubrick brings to life the haunting bestseller by Stephen King.
2651;Jack Nicholson is at his best, as the recovering alcoholic and winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel.
2652;His wife, Wendy, and son Danny reside in the isolated hotel with him as he attempts to finish his novel.
2653;The often overused saying, A picture is worth a thousand words, is truly the essence of this movie.
2654;kubrick's style of moviemaking was perfect for this film, and no director could have managed to do it better.
2655;True, this film is frightening and disturbing, but also an amazing work of art by one of the greatest directors of all time.
2656;This is one of the greatest horror or suspense movies of all time.
2657;The building up of Jack's insanity was done superbly.
2658;With out a doubt Stephen King's book get's the royal treatment in this superb Stanley Kubrick film, and The shining turns out to be the best film ever made from a Stephen King novel.
2659;His films are often undeniable masterpieces.
2660;It certainly seemed like an odd pairing, but it worked very well.
2661;Nicholson's Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances ever put on film.
2662;In fact every actor in this movie was cast so perfectly the movie just overflows with some of the best performances and memorable characters one could ever hope for.
2663;Shelly Duval turns in the best performance of her career as do numerous other actors, especially Scattman Crothers who is simply brilliant.
2664;Kubrick fills the movie with so much atmosphere that the audience can feel it all.
2665;And the creation of the Overlook hotel was a masterful achievement.
2666;One of the best performers in this movie is the hotel it's self.
2667;Of course Nicholson and King fans are the ones that wanted to see this movie the most when it was first released, and what they got is a dream come true for any fan of either of the two.
2668;It is a powerful, operatic masterpiece.
2669;It was also a very nice surprise to see the superb actor, Philip Stone who played Alex's Dad in a Clockwork Orange in this film as well in the small but memorable role of Delbert Grady.
2670;From beginning to end The Shining is by far one of the three best Horror movies ever made.
2671;I love old movies and this was a great depiction of mental health.
2672;But overall it's still a good movie to watch.
2673;Jack Nicholson played that role very well in the Shining.
2674;Jack Nicholson's performance is still really good, and I can appreciate the cinematography as the camera looks down long, supposedly ominous hallways, and I also appreciate that The Shining broke ground for horror movies yet to come.
2675;Worth watching for the cultural references, if nothing else.
2676;Amazing to think that Stephen King did not like this adaptation.
2677;kubrick, on the other hand, was wise to focus on the characters who inhabit and haunt the Overlook Hotel, both past and present.
2678;Their evilness in thoughts and deeds is manifested brilliantly in Nicholson's performance.
2679;He manages to be manical without going over the top, without wrecking the suspension of disbelief.
2680;like visuals, the coldness and isolation of the hotel, and the mystery that pervades the movie are all brilliantly done.
2681;kubrick diffuses and lightens King's manipulative scenarios and the movie is more powerful for it.
2682;The Shining is easily one of the best horror movies ever made.
2683;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
2684;A real classic that never gets old.
2685;If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and a lover of scary movies, I highly recommend this unforgettable flick!
2686;What a marriage between the amazing talents of Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and Stanley Kubrick!
2687;With wonderfully memorable performances by Scatman Crothers and child actor Danny Lloyd, the terrifying story comes to life on the screen.
2688;A must see for anyone wanting to see a thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat to the very end!
2689;stanley Kubrick was amazing at photographing sets and locations.
2690;the leads are pretty good in their respective roles.
2691;there are many memorable scenes but the one that always stuck with me is the one in the washroom.
2692;A classic horror movie with amazing soundtrack.
2693;While the other actors leave a bit to be desired, Jack Nicholson's performance makes the movie great.
2694;I saw this years before and decided to see it again.
2695;It is a very suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2696;Jack Nicholson is always entertaining to see.
2697;and it's a delightful transformation!
2698;An eerie and inspiring film for any dark night!
2699;In the book, you had a good idea that this was Jack's last chance at keeping a steady income while working on his play.
2700;i think Jack Nicholson was a great choice for the lead character.
2701;made by someone with a deeper understanding of the book and characters.
2702;One of the best horror movies ever,I had to order it because as a horror fan this movie had it all except monsters, (oh that Jack Nicholson was the monster,) and I loved the way both he and Shelly Long played their parts in this movie,I consider it masterful
2703;A classic you can watch over and over : ) No matter how many times I watch it, I always enjoy it!
2704;This is definately a movie directed at older auidences, as they will understand the plot better.
2705;The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick based the the Stephen King Novel.
2706;this is by far one of the scaries movies I have seen.
2707;the movie starts off with beautiful mountain scenery and a car driving towards a location, which we soon found out it is the Overlook Hotel ( The outside shot of the hotel is actually a hotel in Oregon called The Timberline Lodge).
2708;The music is scary and it has an inpending doom sound to it.
2709;Even after telling him about the tragedy that took place here with the previous caretaker, he still takes the job.
2710;These scenes are interesting because they actually happened or will happen.
2711;"This is a great start as to what ""The Shining"" actually means."
2712;nicolson is already not normal looking so he was perfectly cast for the role.
2713;He starts to hallucinate and walks into a bar with a bartender there that offers him a drink.
2714;But the next time around in his litle buggy it is open.
2715;Interesting to leave to the imagination.
2716;He walks in to the room Wendy told him too and you see a nude woman slowly pullimg out the curtains and walking to him.
2717;Now the hotel is testing is loyalty to Wendy.
2718;He gives in of course.
2719;"The women strats mocking him because ""the hotel"" is making fun of him and how he still cant cope with things."
2720;He says that Danny and Wendy are preventing him from fullfilling his duties and Danny has a special force and is bringing in help.
2721;I give this movie 10 stars it makes you think and gets me scared every time I watch it.
2722;It is definately a horror masterpiece in my opionion.
2723;I watched this again yesterday and I loved it!
2724;He and his wife and son Danny are going to take care of the hotel while closed down.
2725;I saw this when I was a kid and I got scared!
2726;for the first time as a regular movie or with the enhancements this movie holds you to it's conclusion.
2727;The book was really good.
2728;but if that was the first epic horror movie, and Exorcist the second, then Kubrick's The Shining comes a very, VERY close third, and in many ways, beats those other masterpiece works of cinema at their own game.
2729;lovers amongst us (myself included, a teriffic read and one of King's unequivocal best) I'll just say this: the film version of The Shining is one of those joyfully rare things where the novel loses nothing in the translation.
2730;In fact, thanks to the Screenplay's omission of several key.
2731;It makes for a compelling comparison .
2732;Unencumbered by such character exploration and explanation, (which works exquisitely well in the novel, a counterpoint, if you will, to the madness of Overlook Jack), Kubrick (Rest In Peace, you deserve it!)
2733;To say more is to spoil it, but trust me, it's worth every damn second of screen time.
2734;wise, we have Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, but here it works oh.
2735;esque mania of the movie's final reel bear all the hallmarks of truly great acting.
2736;He is, in short, perfectly cast in his role, and gives one of his finest performances in The Shining .
2737;In her role as Wendy, Shelley Duvall is a light, a wonderful actress portraying with scalpel precision the frailty and ignorant fear of a woman caught in the middle.
2738;Her portrayal of Wendy is as accomplished as it is endearing, and of the three main leads in the picture, hers is the most developed character .
2739;wendy is brought about by Duvall's exquisite ability to showcase a broad range of believable emotion in a relatively short amount of screen time.
2740;Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance is excellent, the much.
2741;parlayed 'Redrum' scene is a gem, and he is perfectly believable as the psychic Kid with the weight of the World (or at least, the weight of the Overlook) on his small shoulders.
2742;the Direction is what sets The Shining apart, but with a genius like Kubrick at the helm, what can we expect?
2743;like guttural bellows create an ideal and perfect aural accompaniment to the already ideal visual.
2744;It must be owned and watched, and that is all.
2745;Kubrick made this a masterpiece.
2746;what better place for Nickolson to strut his absolute best work.
2747;Shelley Duvall was an excellent choice to play the scatterbrain wife with the wide popping eyes at all the right times.
2748;Nicholson chasing Duvall up the stairs and cornering her in the bathroom, and 4.
2749;I have to admit, The Shining is one of the scariest stories that has ever been made into a movie.
2750;Let's face it, the acting is NOT very good.
2751;Granted, its 4.5 hours long and that allows for a little more, but the character development is extraordinary.
2752;With the original it seemed that Jack woke up one day and was crazy.
2753;In the remake, its possible to see the subtle levels of his insanity as it happens.
2754;3 stars, still very scary and has great atmosphere.
2755;This movie is still good even after more than twenty years .
2756;By any standard this is one of the greatest sci fi films of all time.
2757;Nicholson and Shelly Duvall are at their best.
2758;shelly Duvall being really vulnerableIncredible steadicam work.
2759;(With a commentary track with the steadicam's inventor as well as a Kubrick biographer.)
2760;Great movie but unwatchable via streaming.
2761;the Shining is a horror with a great story line which puts it a cut above the rest!This movie is Awesome!
2762;And will make a great addition to your Movie Library.
2763;It's worth a try watching, especially if you're not into the modern super gory horror of today.
2764;It'll still make you pretty scared with very few scenes that could be considered scary.
2765;It's interesting, and if you do watch it check out the spoof trailer on youtube that makes it look like a family film, that'll make you laugh.
2766;This is Jack Nicholson's second best performance (after Cuckoo's Nest) and perhaps Shelley Duvall's best.
2767;Long time since I watched the whole movie and it's as great as ever.
2768;prove his ability as a groundbreaking, fresh, mesmerizing and truely brilliant film artist with THE SHINING.
2769;Despite what Stephen King fans might say, (and to those who prefer 1997's debasing ABC miniseries version of King's book which looked more like something to be shown on the Disney channel during Halloween time)Kubrick's epic is nothing short of the first, true beautiful horror film.
2770;blowing and genguinely frightening .
2771;it's images and music convey startling moments in unforgettable terror.
2772;A must for fans of the genre and for those who appreciate fine, artistic and important American cinema.
2773;The haunting music, the isolated hotel, the splendidly chosen cast, and Kubrick's genius made one of the most eerie and suspensful movies of all time.
2774;The beginning sets the stage and slowly takes us into the lonely hotel with just the three human occupants.
2775;I particularly enjoyed Lloyd the bartender and Grady the caretaker.
2776;Their impeccable grooming and polite manners disguise their fiendish intent.
2777;Shelley Duvall was a perfect choice for Jack's wife.
2778;She has that vunerable frail look about her and fear faces can convey fear the way she did in some of the key scenes.
2779;Stanley Kubrick's vision shows through in this snowed in thriller.
2780;This movie is beautifully filmed as Stanley's other epics
2781;The first was the theatrically released classic from Brian De Palma, Carrie, and the second being the Tobe Hooper miniseries, Salem's Lot.
2782;"technically, this film is a masterpiece
2783;Kubrick's meticulousness coupled with the incredible cinematography .
2784;There is so much of this movie that will truly stay with you long after it is over.
2785;worthy performance of Jack Torrance.
2786;is littered with some of filmdom's most devilishly quotable lines.
2787;It holds up as one of the genre's most creepiest and unsettling films.
2788;was brilliantly chronicled in the widely available documentary, The Making of the Shining, by Kubrick's daughter, Vivian.
2789;Like the film it covers, it is a must see.
2790;ray both feature an informative commentary track by Steadicam Inventor/Operator Garrett Brown and Historian John Baxter.
2791;As to be expected, the set includes the film's theatrical trailer, as well.
2792;It's a wonderful release that has never made the film look or sound better.
2793;The saucer eyed Duvall is visceral and waiflike in terror.
2794;This is the introspective version of the story, unlike the later version that King preferred.
2795;This is all understated, in the background but every detail of what unfolds fits in with this psychology.
2796;It is a masterpiece like cut crystal.
2797;You feel this just by looking at him, every gesture of the character consistent with his mental state.
2798;He looks frightening, but there is love in him, too, as the thing begins to struggle for his mind.
2799;Shelly Duvall, his wife, is is absolutely amazing, as she watches, the terror mounting inside of her until she can barely speak.
2800;with supernatural powers of extrasensory communication .
2801;When Duvall discovers that something is wrong, it is one of the most terrifying moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but what does it is her acting, her demeanor of hysteria and despair.
2802;My favorite is the appearance of Nicholson in an old photograph, leaving it to the viewer to interpret.
2803;It is a one wonderful detail among many that enter the careful viewers' imagination to fit in with all the other parts of the film.
2804;It is brilliant and perfect, just like the way that the boy escapes.
2805;recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
2806;One of the best I have ever seen.
2807;Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980) is a cinematic marvel.
2808;Visually stunning, emotionally disturbing, it throws everything at you but the kitchen sink.
2809;Kubrick directed this filmic adaptation of the Stephen King bestseller with his finetoothed artistic brush"
2810;When the movie was finally finished and released in 1980, it received cheers and jeers in roughly equal amounts, from critics to Stephen King fans.
2811;i can see both sides to the controversy.
2812;On the other hand, many of Kubrick's changes were for the better, the most notable of them being the hedge maze replacing the hedge animals from the book.
2813;Jack Nicholson, who had already established himself as one of the most important actors of our time with his very well.
2814;deserved 1975 Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of faux.
2815;Shelley Duvall brings an intensity to Wendy Torrance that was perhaps under.
2816;old Danny Lloyd, in his debut to his very brief film career (he would only do one other film after this one), is compulsively watchable as five.year.
2817;old Danny Torrance and completely commands our attention every time he's onscreen.
2818;But the film works on so many visual levels that it can be forgiven for its lack of character development.
2819;THE SHINING may not be perfect, but it is nevertheless a Horror classic, a Stanley Kubrick classic and a Jack Nicholson classic.
2820;and it leaves us with a final shot that is as haunting as it is thought.
2821;This is a cherished timeless classic horror film.
2822;This is just a fun movie that I can enjoy over and over.
2823;"First, I consider ""Shining"" to be the greatest novel ever written, so take my opinion with that in mind."
2824;i remember well standing in line for two hours outside of Oakbrook Commons theatre, almost trembling with excitement to see this film.
2825;"It was the most anticipated ""event"" in years for my circle of friends."
2826;A possibly real, yet benign spirit who manifested to Danny at the moments when he was needed the most.
2827;A competent, wary and spry Dick Halloran who LIVES.
2828;grizzly Wendy who loved her son and would never be found whimpering and cowering in hallways.
2829;Overall, I'd say, you found very faulty, yet very human, and very likeable characters.
2830;This silent crowd slowly blending into a blurred mass as tears formed in my eyes.
2831;"I'm serious, ""Shining"" is my favourite novel ever, and this abomination actually moved me to tears of grief."
2832;everyone faces their own demons in their own way.
2833;"That's the lifeblood of the ""Shining"" novel."
2834;"absorbed director spending two and a half hours showing us all how ""cool"" and ""trendy"" he is."
2835;I'm sure it will make it to film one day.
2836;Danny feels and sees these ghosts, but he keeps it to himself and resists them.
2837;i am a big fan of Stephen King's novels and `The Shining' was one of the best.
2838;When I originally saw this film in the theatre, the audience howled in laughter at Mr. Nicholson in the scene where he interviews for the job.
2839;the only reason that this film gets two stars is because it is, if nothing else, a visually stunning film and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful with music from Wendy Carlos, Bela Bartok and Gyorgi Ligeti.
2840;Compare this film with the three part television version by Director Mick Garris (starring Rebecca DeMornay and Steven Weber) and you will see that the latter is much better.
2841;This is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films in my estimation.
2842;His last film (Eyes Wide Shut) is a really good film although it's content is certainly for adults only.
2843;This movie was widescreen in the theaters!
2844;Wonderful movie that played great with no problems.
2845;Don't get me wrong, the Shining is one of my favorite movies.
2846;In the case of classic movies, the improved video and audio is just enough.
2847;If they incluye a new documentary or long lost interviews is ok, but as the disc extras, not, please, as part of the feature film.
2848;A great Classic by one of Hollywoods Premier actors.
2849;still as memorable as the first time I saw it.
2850;Where's the reflection by the cast on their experiences on the set?This is a film that should have been an education to dive into and an opportunity to pay homage to a brilliant film.
2851;Unlike today's whitewashed assembly line space fillers, this one takes you behind the scenes with candid insights, such as the tension between Shelly Duval and the director.
2852;"And you can see Jack Nicholson preparing for his famous ""Here's Johnny!"""
2853;Was awesome to watch, it's a classic for sure!
2854;this is an excellent film (in an awful creepy way!)
2855;this is a two disc set and the series of bonus features are well worth having.
2856;The director's daughter has created an excellent documentary throughout the filming process, which is a highlight of the bonus features.
2857;look, you're watching it at home so there are a lot of things that differ from the theatrical screening.
2858;when seeing it with an audience of strangers.
2859;It's true that Kubrick, the prodigy photographer, is always using color and composition to establish mood and meaning.
2860;But THE SHINING is a classic.
2861;for the rest of us, it's terrific!
2862;"What more can you ask for 
2863;A must for movie buffs .
2864;Amazon streaming movies are the best !!!
2865;One of the creepiest horror films, Stanley Kubrick (The Clockwork Orange) brings this masterpiece of mental madness.
2866;Nicholson is enthralling with his famous """"Heeeeeeereeeees Johnny!!!"""""""
2867;The movie is a great Sunday night flick.
2868;Kubrick's pacing is masterful, if somewhat measured by today's expectations.
2869;this movie will make your skin crawl, even on a re.
2870;watch, and it achieves this effect with a subtlety that somehow amplifies the creepiness even further.
2871;Grab some friends and popcorn and settle in a dark room for a great experience.
2872;Be prepared that some scenes will stick with you forever.
2873;i'll eventually go back and see it again.
2874;really cool movie, long as well but worth it.
2875;ray] (2007) looks really good.
2876;The picture is the clearest I've seen of the movie and there's a lot of details to be seen throughout.
2877;The objects and details in the background of the hotel are distinct and clearly seen.
2878;You can clearly see the details on the actors' faces, such as pores.
2879;I was especially impressed by the wider inside camera shots of the hotel.
2880;ray of the movie someday, but until that time comes, this disc is as good as you can get of The Shining.
2881;This movie is a classic and I am ashamed I hadn't seen it before.
2882;Jack Nicolson keep you at the edge of your seat until the end.
2883;Jack Nicholson's finest moments are caught in thisfilm.
2884;Stanley Kubrick's finest on the edge of your seat film.
2885;Every single scene in this movie is brilliant.
2886;I shudder to think of the deep recesses of the mind that King, Kubrick and Nicholson went to to create this horror masterpiece, but I thank them for it!
2887;The Shining is one of my all time favorite movies ever.
2888;"It felt like we were watching a great new movie for the first time
2889;ray made that much of a difference!As usual, I am completely pleased with Amazon's service, prices, and quick shipping.
2890;This is one of the best movies featuring Jack Nicholson that I have watched.
2891;One of the best horror movies I have ever seen.
2892;Jack Nicholson's performance shines above all.
2893;Great Camerawork and background score act as a bonus.
2894;Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Shining has become an extremely important part of popular film culture, with many scenes and lines from the movie appearing in all forms of media.
2895;And Shelly Duvall was perfect as the abused wife.
2896;an old classic presented the way it should be.
2897;The main reason I'm writing this review is to make sure people know that The Shining was originally and still is a 'full screen' flick.
2898;I love widescreen movies, but this one isn't!
2899;And the music is pretty engaging as well.
2900;It does contain some interesting (maybe disturbing is a better word) scenes, but mainly the movie is just beautifully creepy.
2901;As the author ofA Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)I love a good ghost story.
2902;The Shining film does more than is necessary to fit the bill and has become something of an American cultural icon when it comes to horror.
2903;It's filled with great, scary, and horrifying moments.
2904;There's good tension and a steadily unveiling mystery, which I think are absolutely key elements to any Ghost Story worth it's weight in gold.
2905;If you're a horror movie aficionado, this is as good as place as any to start.
2906;That, I think, is in Part Jack Nicholson's doing.
2907;a very good movie my favorite horror movie thank you.
2908;i watch it a whole lot .
2909;My 83 year old mom remarked that the Shining was her favorite spooky movie and it was about 5 days before Christmas so I ordered it for her!
2910;This was such an appropriate role for Nicholson in his younger years.
2911;He is one of those actors who is always a delight to watch, whatever his character's disposition.
2912;The unique pleasure of a Kubrick film is not necessarily the story itself"
2913;Before reading the novel,I've always quite liked this movie.
2914;But Torrance in the novel is a well crafted deep character who was butchered in the movie.
2915;In the novel she is strong willed,smart, and a natural mother.
2916;It shows in the actors performances.
2917;A real thriller that captures the mind of a psychopath and allows you a peak inside.
2918;Daniel Lloyd was good, but wasn't in with the script to truly understand his character.
2919;look, if you love this movie, that's okay.
2920;Very true to the book.
2921;The film looks great either way, and I prefer watching it this way.2) This .
2922;the bonus features, while not extensive, are satisfying.
2923;com pretty much knows all that is talked about in concerns of the making of the film.
2924;there is a shorter piece on the visionary look of the film and the way Kubrick stylized it.
2925;overall, this is an amazing film and got a pretty decent special edition with a beautiful Widescreen transfer to boot.
2926;The little boy moving his finger and saying Redrum in that growly voice is also embarassing.
2927;There were fleeting moments of tension and great photography, period.
2928;Nicholson's smarminess, Duvall's crying and whining, and the little boy with his redrum were enough to send me screaming fomr the room.
2929;Love Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, but this one.
2930;"Stephen King is a great writer
2931;Such a top old movie, loved the child actor on he's bike.
2932;Nobody could play the part as good as Jack
2933;Shelly Duvall had the most number of takes ever, I read.
2934;the movie does have its chilling, insane moments.
2935;The ending is thoughtful but a bit of a let.
2936;But it's one of my favorite films, I maybe saw it about twenty times.
2937;This film has layers of meaning, each time you see it is like you're pulling one of this layers up.
2938;And with sure some fans of Stephen King will not like it, but that's because they want see a simple transfer for the movies of King's book.
2939;I myself always liked King books, I read maybe all the classic King books.
2940;But Kubrick is not a entertainment director, this guy is craftsman, he delayed about 5 years inbetween his works to make this movies look like deep masterpieces, since Barry Lyndon this goal is bright clear in Kubrick work.
2941;Therefore if you like art films you'll enjoy it, without of course judging it for being, at least at surface, a horror movie.
2942;My son and I were excited to watch this movie again!!
2943;Not a real big King fan, but I do like Kubrick, so maybe it'll even outIf your just looking for a good movie, you'll like it.
2944;Yes, indeed, Stanley Kubrick did take liberties with King's 1977 novel.
2945;Kubrick's entire approach to filmmaking is based on taking a well.
2946;know piece of literature and twisting it to meet his own artistic vision.
2947;And what a vision it is!
2948;While there is a genuine sense of dread permeating throughout the film, it actually plays more successfully as a sly satire of the horror genre than as the real deal.
2949;Jack Nicholson's performance, for example, is a comedic one"
2950;dimensional parody of their real.
2951;And it all takes place within one of the finest set designs ever used in a Hollywood film.
2952;If there ever was a testament to the enormous talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, this it is.
2953;Despite it being an older movie, it was perfectly scary yet fun to watch.
2954;so if you are looking for a nice great scary movie with a great plot and horror.
2955;school teacher, fancies himself a budding writer, and thinks he's found the perfect job to bring his fermenting ideas to fruition.
2956;He's also bringing his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his psychic son, Danny (Danny Lloyd).
2957;It's something that's never brought up in the film.
2958;On Wikipedia, it says that Robin Williams of all people was considered for the role of Jack, but Nicholson does a pretty good job of channeling him.
2959;His performance also reminded me a lot of Jim Carrey, or actually Nicholson's own turn as the Joker.
2960;nicholson does a lot better portraying insanity when he's not talking and Kubrick is able to just focus on his body language and expressions.
2961;which brings me to another point.
2962;Just the fact that you have this huge hotel being perfectly still gives me chill bumps.
2963;And the way Kubrick perfectly frames the rooms and uses disquieting color schemes just adds to the effect.
2964;i enjoyed watching this movie again since I hadn't seen it in ages.
2965;also definitely check out the novel by Stephen King, which is even better than the movie!
2966;The Shining is just a great ghost scary movie that has it all from start to the very end!!!!!
2967;Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall star in this Stephen King shocker!!!!!!
2968;One thing that Jack does not know is his own son has a gift known as the shining which he can read people's minds and listen to their conversions without opening his mouth!!!!!
2969;Stanley Kurbick directs this intense thriller and it will keep you on your toes the whole entire time and if you love reading Stephen King novels then check out this movie and i also like that Stanley kept to the book which makes it real and scary at times within the movie!!!!!!
2970;Best scary movie of all time.
2971;This version of the movie is not as good as the other but it's still good.
2972;The product itself was good.
2973;Anyway, they're pretty nice people.
2974;A Stanely Kubrick classic and arguably the best Stephen King adaption.
2975;Made famous with an amazing performance from Jack Nickolson and surprisingly Shelly Duvall.
2976;Filled with smart and twisted vielence and a nag for making you twich in a bazzare and horrifying fassion.
2977;It's fun to watch the constant feud between Stanely Kubrick and Shelly Duvall throughout the behind the scenes extra footage.
2978;The Shining is the best scary movie of all time!
2979;The Shining has the perfect mix of drama, action, humor, and horror that is by far, the best Stephen King story there is!
2980;It works just as well now was still scared to death.
2981;One of my all time favorite movies!
2982;Stephen king actually got his inspiration from staying at the Stanley hotel in Colorado for a few months.
2983;The real hotel (Stanley) and the fictional hotel (overlook) have a lot of similarities and both are haunted!
2984;It really is a great movie and bound to give you the creeps.
2985;a great cast, well directed and rounded off with an excellent musical score.
2986;i would recommend anyone who saw this as a kid sit down and watch it again!
2987;Love Jack Nicholson can't wait to read Doctor Sleep, I Love Stephen King novels.
2988;He really knows how to get you scared!
2989;Her quirkiness continually distracts the viewer to the point that Kubrick's brilliant timing and perspective rarely trump in Duvall's scenes.
2990;This is such a great movie.
2991;Jack Nicholson is at his best.
2992;The Shining is an amazing film, it's suspenseful and scary.
2993;It added more to Kubrick's horror masterpiece.
2994;It also has a lot of bonus material to keep the viewer happy.
2995;This is a classic scarry/psychological thriller.
2996;Kubrick really delivers in this film.
2997;It is so wierd and yet so wonderful!
2998;I rate this film highly, because I loved it and I think that you'll love it too.
2999;"I guarantee that you will ""feel something"" when watching this picture."
3000;are great in this one.
3001;It truly is a classic horror movie, especially when its based off a book.
3002;The movie is fantastic and I could recommend it to any fan of Kubrick, King (although it's almost not even the same work of fiction as King's original novel), or horror.
3003;This is my favorite Steven King.
3004;something that has never seen this really owes it to themselves to watch this masterpiece.
3005;and this film uses spectacular camera work, background noise, and the best visual effects of the time to produce some very chilling scenes.
3006;I stress to you that you must watch the original and not the remake with Steven Wright.
3007;Stanley Kubric mind of horror along with Stephen Kings chilling master piece novel make this a much watch.
3008;The special features will have you screaming for your 'mummy'.
3009;the stroyline is mainly revolves around the mysterious Overlook Hotel.
3010;The power to read other peoples thoughts.
3011;[Pictured above]/ Not as well composed as the novel but well worth watching.
3012;The Shining is a haunting film, featuring the marvelous performance of Jack Nicholson.
3013;He drinks to his heart's delight.
3014;His child, Danny, can see haunting images of evil in the Overlook Hotel.
3015;I recommend this film, but fans of the book may be disappointed.
3016;In the movie, Jack is always kind of crazy.
3017;Still, it is a great film, but only because of Jack Nicholson's performance.
3018;Of course Sid the Elf is very familiar with The Shining.
3019;This is one is in the pantheon of horror films.
3020;Sid has seen bits and pieces(that's what it's like.
3021;knowing full well what happens in the movie, after not seeing it for at least a few years, Sid found Jack really interesting.
3022;Even in the begining of the flick you can see that he's a little psycho.
3023;This is especially true when you account for the Chuck factor and the awesome visuals accompanied by cool/creepy music.
3024;As for The Shining, here's a quick rundown of the film's scariest moments:1.
3025;saw it on TV a few years back, and I thought it was great.
3026;As far as I am concerned, this is a finely honed horror story, scary as hell.
3027;with incredible performances by Duvall and Nicholson.
3028;Since so many reviewers cover the plot so well, I'll concentrate on some other points.
3029;Kubrick's masterful use of brilliant lighting to convey the horrors, the wonderful sets, and the music.
3030;One of the high moments of sheer horror for me was when Shelley Duvall found Jack's writing.
3031;Tony has misgivings about the place, and leaks these premonitions into Danny's mind.
3032;Wendy comes across extremely strongly as being ineffectual and weak, thanks to the wonderful performance of Shelley Duvall.
3033;Wendy is hysterical, and it's clear how much she wants to love him, in spite of Jack's cold hatred.
3034;In spite of the fact that Jack was caretaker long before him (See the photo Kubrick slowly zooms in on at the end.)
3035;In spite of the fact that he looks entirely human, Kubrick's masterful lighting brings something of the outer dark to what at first seems to be a throwaway character.
3036;The Dies Irae is familiar to me, and is an old piece of music, going back at least into the nineteenth century.
3037;They just point out Kubrick's genius in setting the mood.
3038;With that in mind, a viewer can easily expect to see another murdered child or parts of her.
3039;jack Nicholson always turns in wonderful work.
3040;He's a total professional and physically fits the role of Jack Torrance like a glove.
3041;Thanks to Nicholson's work, we can seriously wonder if Jack Torrance ever was truly sane.
3042;And, since the family seems so normal on the surface, it's a frightening thought for the rest of us.
3043;human, as though he's a spirit visiting this world from the Other Side.
3044;All in all, The Shining, under Kubrik, is a cinematic gem.
3045;When I do, I can compare them.
3046;The Shining is probably one of the greatest horror films of the 20th century.
3047;It starts off slow, but once it gets going it is a journey into the mind of a psychopath.
3048;It is definitely a horror classic.
3049;To this day, it is still one of Jack Nicholson best rolls (in my opinion).
3050;It is great to see what rolls actors will pick up when they are trying to get discovered or trying to make bigger names for themselves.
3051;I remember it raised the small hairs on the nape of my neck.
3052;The movie, back then, even though not quite as horrific as the book, did its' job and sufficiently kept us both on the edge of our seats.
3053;I really liked Stanley Kubrick's version of Stephen king's novel.
3054;I think Jack Nicholson was perfect guy for the lead role.
3055;Rebecca De Mornay put forth a much better performance in the T. v. remake.
3056;Jack Nicholson's uncanny ability to bring out the lunatic in his character, with those devilish facial expressions, is an absolute treat to the fans of horror.
3057;still very scary to this day, The Shining is one of my all.
3058;They really knew how to make them back in those days.
3059;This is one movie that everyone should see.
3060;this is Jack Nic at his best.
3061;the movie provides that chilling music that keep the chill bumps growing.
3062;it really rides high when the Hotel comes alive.
3063;shelly Duvall play olive oil at her best ,she does a fantastic job along with Danny lloyd.
3064;the truth behind the Elegant hotel is so haunting from the dead woman to the blood river that comes through the elevater doors.
3065;but the movie was still excellent please check it out.
3066;Leave it to brilliant Stephen King to give us such great horror!
3067;"The Shining will always remain one of those ""classic"" horror films."
3068;Jack Nicholson was the perfect choice for this movie.
3069;He really plays the role to a T!!
3070;This movie gives justice to the book.
3071;"When asked to summarize 'The Shining' in few words, I always respond with, ""It's the greatest movie about writers block ever filmed""."
3072;I think this is a fair explanation considering that the supernatural should be something beyond the reach of human thinking and reason.
3073;Jack Nicholson is wild here, you can tell from the instant you see him, there's something going on in him that's not quite right.
3074;And Shelley Duvall is perfect as the shy and loving wife who feels scorned by her husband and confused by her child.
3075;it would be fair to say that 'The Shining' is, if not the best, one of the greatest gothic horror films ever produced.
3076;The music was WAAAAAY over the top.
3077;The acting was very good (especially Jack Nicholson.
3078;Excellent and deeply disturbing film about a family isolated in an enormous empty hotel in the middle of nowhere.
3079;All I can say is: watch it!
3080;I just got the entire Kubrick collection in Blu.
3081;ray and, so far, The Shining is my favorite of all the releases.
3082;The transfer is stunning, the audio is clean, and the extras compelling.
3083;Seeing The Shining in hi.
3084;Now as Danny motors through the hotel you actually FEEL the sense of movement!
3085;I remember when I saw it in the theatre how excited the crowd was during those shots.
3086;the extras are also great.
3087;funny and creepy,, but good lord I do wish jack Nicholson world have killed off his wife in this version .
3088;So it was great to finally see this classic and fill in the gaps.
3089;in any case, Nicholson's performance was great.
3090;The Shining is a must have!
3091;Best horror movie ever made.
3092;Stanley Kubrick is so brilliant the way he's able to progressively disturb the viewer with such calculated subtly.
3093;hOWEVER, the book is much scarier!
3094;the 4 star rating is for the film, which is an excellent example of highbrow horror filmmaking that uses music effectively.
3095;, he slowly starts to transform from his fatherly ways of living, and turns into a crazed maniac who is determined to slaughter his family, as did Mr. Mcgrady, the previous caretaker.
3096;but the second time you see it, you get to take in each scene and see how Kubrick filmed it.
3097;every scene has that kind of special structure.
3098;balance for the entire film.
3099;It's amazing how many people didn't read the book before seeing the film (especially if you read reviews of the book).
3100;Is The Shining a good movie?
3101;It's a great movie if you put the book aside and forget it's supposed to be based off the book.
3102;In it's own right, it is a good film.
3103;As I said, in its own right it's a farily good film.
3104;And only Jack's son Danny really knows.
3105;It really is one of those movies that if you stick with it, your questions will be answered.
3106;This is because Jack Nichelson really gets into the part and finally starts to do some acting.
3107;the entire chase between Danny and his father is perhaps the most memorable moment in the movie.
3108;There are other memorable parts as well.
3109;really, if you forget it's supposed to be based off the classic novel by Stephen King then you will love this movie!
3110;in it's own right, it's a good film.
3111;And to some of them, you'll have to read the book.
3112;I have enjoyed this movie ever since I can remember.
3113;And years later it's finally available on the best (so far) video format around.
3114;I give the actual movie five stars.
3115;I just hope they re.
3116;This is one of those classic horror movies that you would keep on watching over and over again.
3117;Jack Nicholson plays a big role in the movie his acting is amaziing, makes it look so real.
3118;Kubrick was so good with Barry Lyndon, and other work, but The Shining was really disappointing, and it could have been so good, with the talent involved.
3119;give me a break, altho Sissy Spacek was good, as always.
3120;this movie could have been so good.
3121;on of the best horror movie ever made.
3122;This film will pull you in from the very first scene.
3123;The cinematography rivals ANY work done today on film.
3124;The scenic landscape in it's cold tone will set you up for a good haunt.
3125;although Nicholson's performance is superb, it is ON point: I think the supporting cast is far better, that is saying so much btw.
3126;Duvall's performance is so believable that one cannot help but be mesmerized by the on screen performance.
3127;Danny Lloyd's performance is one of the greatest child performances ever filmed.
3128;this film captures the past and future.
3129;The foreboding feeling will come over you quick and strong.
3130;i'm not certain who to thank for this great film, Kubrick or the cast and those behind the scenes.
3131;It is NOT fair to judge this film against the novel: The film is FAR superior.
3132;Great job to all involved.
3133;"perfect films like this only come along once in a ""blue moon""."
3134;If you own it, watch it again.
3135;As with all movies based on novels by Stephen King, they are very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat.
3136;Jack Nicholson is the best at playing his part in the movie.
3137;This movie is by far the best movie to be made that was based on a novel.
3138;The only reason this isn't getting a 1 star rating is because Jack Nicholson's acting was superb in this movie!
3139;Outstanding director, outstanding cast, and an all around outstanding movie.
3140;There are differences throughout, but still a great classic chilling movie!Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders
3141;SK shot it open matte.
3142;Plausibly, BOTH are (and SJ's symmetrical compositions generally look fine both ways).
3143;the Shining displays a beautiful video transfer with natural colorizations showing off Kubrick's wonderful lens craft and cinematography.
3144;It does make a big difference.
3145;The movie is getting on in years but it holds up and has legs, just wish they had put as much effort into remastering the audio as they did with the fine video transfer.
3146;The extras, I found to be worthwhile and interesting.
3147;This is one of my favorite scary movies, and one of Kubrick's best!
3148;Everyone in the cast gives great performances, and the direction is super, but the real star of the film is the Overlook Hotel.
3149;This all leads to the cat.
3150;When I figured out my Top 10 horror movies, The Shining took the top spot.
3151;The Shining is that and a whole lot more.
3152;It begins like a drama and takes plenty of time to establish its world, and the majority of the film takes place in the Overlook Hotel.
3153;the opening shots are incredible and set the mood.
3154;He'll live there for six months with his wife, Wendy (Duvall), and their young son, Danny (Lloyd).
3155;They can communicate without words.
3156;i mentioned that the film takes time setting things up.
3157;Jack uses one of the large rooms to work on his novel and Danny explores by driving around the halls in his toy car.
3158;I tend to believe that the ghosts and everything we see is real.
3159;Wendy sees guests at a party and Jack interacts with Grady and Lloyd.
3160;danny's gift is extremely powerful and attracts the attention of Dick when he is 2,000 miles away.
3161;I like both versions of the story, but I have to admit that Kubrick's changes played out well on the screen.
3162;the dialogue is sparse, but very satisfying at times.
3163;I particularly enjoy the exchanges when Jack is talking to Lloyd and Grady.
3164;Nicholson is convincing when he acts crazy and the final act shows him at his crazy best.
3165;ray presentation is one of the best for an older movie.
3166;This film may not be scary, but it has chills and thrills!
3167;Fine acting and chilling music!
3168;The Stanley Kubrick film the Shining from 1980, this movies been my favorite for years.
3169;Jack Nicholson does a outstanding job in the part , who only couldve don this good of a job.
3170;I love the steps scene, my favorite part.
3171;I think this is the best horror movie made.
3172;Just got done reading the book and was very interested to see how the movie was.
3173;I just love the Shining!
3174;The book is better than the movie, but the madness is still portrayed in this epic horror film.
3175;These two films are both visually stimulating, but they don't resonate with the viewer emotionally.
3176;And to my surprise, I realized that I liked the movie.
3177;I just watched it again this weekend (thank you powers that be for the gift that is the CHILLER Channel!)
3178;Oh, and ya gotta love that Scatman!
3179;Jack Nicholson does a fantastic job of scaring the hell out of you.
3180;I highly recommend this film.
3181;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
3182;I liked how easy it was to order and how fast I received this.
3183;This was on TV the other night, and I really have come to appreciate it as a classic.
3184;law had never seen it, he watched it and love every minute of it.
3185;Even still, this is one of the best, scariest movies ever made.
3186;The 1980 movie adaptation of Stephen King's earlier masterpiece thriller faced criticism from some of Stephen King fans and the author himself who later countered with his own version starring Rebacca De Mornay.
3187;nonetheless, the movie still has a lot to offer and and lures us into locked.
3188;Briliant camerawork let the viewer see the way Daniel does the haunted hotel.
3189;Supporting actors did fine job particularly Joe Turkel (best known as Dr. Tyrell in Braderunner), playing the role of Lloyd, the spooky bartender.
3190;recommended for a wide variety of movie fans.
3191;Also see the Stephen King version and enyoy both.
3192;Hard to believe but this is the first time I have seen this movie.
3193;My granddaughter recommended it and she was spot on.
3194;Seen this movie many times and I am amazed at how well it holds up over the years.
3195;"Letterbox has opened this up to a whole new level, and the detailed picture and sound only enhance one movie that was truly made for blu ray
3196;It's great!It's a classic!Stanley Kubrick is a genius!It's a must see, atleast once!Jack Nicholson does his part hauntingly well!
3197;I have seen it much more, but more than a horror movie, it is completely amusing in so many ways.
3198;he fits the role perfectly.
3199;The dialog is entertaining, and the scenery wonderfully beautiful.
3200;A great movie to have in your collection.
3201;One of my favorite scary movies by far.
3202;Such a classic scary movie.
3203;Me and my family watched this movie several times and we were tripping off Jack Nicholson acting like a raging lunatic, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend.
3204;It just gets inside your head.
3205;I'm certainly not a film student or critic like some of the reviewers here but I'm in awe of Kubrick's accomplishment.
3206;i believe that he makes the movie look very unnatural in quite subtle ways.
3207;Most scenes are brightly lit, and I noticed that there are not many shadows in the movie.
3208;Even in brilliantly lit scenes, you'll notice that things don't cast shadows.
3209;I also noticed that so many of the scenes are set up symmetrically.
3210;There is also a scene in which the viewer is looking at Jack in bed, then the camera pulls back and you see you were actually seeing his reflection in a mirror, then the camera goes BACK into the mirror for the rest of the scene.
3211;Another unnatural feature is Shelley Duvall.
3212;Her performance in this movie has been denigrated but I think it is remarkable.
3213;But, she is an unusual looking woman.
3214;blooded comment that lets us know she intends to fight and live.
3215;Again, to be watching an extended scene in a brightly lit (and highly symmetrical) bathroom with only two actors in the scene and yet not really be able to see one of the actors' face is unnatural and somehow unsettling.
3216;This is powerful psychological stuff.
3217;An absolute masterpiece of slowly mounting unease and fright.
3218;An amazing and absolutely essential movie.
3219;This movie is a true work of art.
3220;It is incredibly beautiful and haunting.
3221;While I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, what is most amazing is how absorbed I still become while watching, and I have seen it at least 20 times.
3222;i feel sad when people belittle Shelley Duvall's performance, as it is key to making the movie a success.
3223;She finds the strength within herself to do what needs to be done, and is in fact quite heroic, despite her mousy nature.
3224;time favorite, but the Shining is the best movie I've ever seen!
3225;Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a caretaker during the winter months at an elite isolated hotel in Colorado that is closed down for the season.
3226;The film (based on the Stephen King novel) was directed by genius Stanley Kubrick who also co. wrote the script.
3227;Truely a scary film with excellent performances, especially by Nicholson, I watched this one three times in one weekend.
3228;Very rarely do you get horror films with this kind of acting.
3229;This two disc set also contains the trailer, behind the scenes footage, commentary, and more.
3230;This is Jack at his best as he plays this fairly normal book writer who takes over a Colorado hotel for the winter as a caretaker with his wife and son.
3231;I have seen this movie like many others have over and over again it is just that good.
3232;Nicholson is a class A actor.
3233;Oldie but goodie award winning movie.
3234;this is a classic movie and everybody should watch it.
3235;Our 16 year old son was naming off scary movies he and his friends liked, and i mentioned the Shining.
3236;I love how Kubrick was able to evoke such a feeling of dread and apprehension using wide.
3237;open spaces and bright lighting.
3238;The soundtrack, a mixture of electronic music by Wendy Carlos and several pieces of classical music, is simply brilliant and one of horror cinema's truly classic scores.
3239;This film richly deserves the moniker """"masterpiece of modern horror."""""""
3240;For a more faithful adaptation, viewers have the King.
3241;For those with an open mind, or those simply seeking to experience one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, The Shining will do nicely, I think.
3242;"I love THE SHINING with a passion usually reserved for movies like THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
3243;ray editions of Kubrick films (EYES WIDE SHUT and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) because I didn't think they were up to snuff, but I bought this because it managed to win me over.
3244;The picture is crisp, sharp, clear, and doggone if the movie doesn't look as new as the day it was made.
3245;ray releases favor the 1.85:1 ratio enhanced to fit the 16:9 screen.
3246;As the diagram on the special features reveals, Kubrick preferred the full.
3247;The problem is, Kubrick's compositions were always strongest from top.
3248;Otherwise, I love this Blu.
3249;ray and heavily recommend it.
3250;The Shining is a great supernatural horror film from the grand master of filmmaking, Stanley Kubrick.
3251;This is especially present in The Shining, along with A Clockwork Orange, another favorite of mine, and a classic.
3252;Young Danny has an extrasensory power known only as the shining.
3253;He tells Jack to kill them.
3254;He will further the pattern, put another piece in the puzzle.
3255;the Shining is a disturbingly gothic fairy tale horror film that has yet to be matched by any other.
3256;One of Kubrick's best, and a modern classic, The Shining is a film that many will enjoy.
3257;there is an air of tension and creepiness throughout this film which I can only attribute to the clever camera shots which give the impression that the film's protagonists are being constantly watched.
3258;forward to this movie than I did when it came out in the summer of 1980.
3259;The first epic horror film was its tagline.
3260;Really?I will say that THE SHINING is probably the most beautifully photographed horror film ever made.
3261;sharp perceptions as a filmmaker appear a little vague and out of focus.
3262;And one of the last shots is Jack with his face pushed through the shattered door.
3263;Somebody, please dig that out!
3264;this is my absolute favorite of horror.
3265;The Shinning with Jack Nicholson is one of the better book to movie by Steven King.
3266;Anybody that's seen this movie knows about that scene at the end where there is this man in a dog/bear costume.
3267;stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived.
3268;Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed """"The Shining,"""" one of the scariest movies ever made."""
3269;The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones.
3270;Stanley Kubrick co. wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.
3271;Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company.
3272;"shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, ""The Shining"" has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie."
3273;The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible.
3274;Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror.
3275;While grand in scale is its beauty and terror, it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity.
3276;arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown.
3277;Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece.
3278;His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career.
3279;He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth.
3280;Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright.
3281;Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.
3282;"although ""The Shining"" is a precarious, well."
3283;"With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this
3284;All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold.
3285;Certainly one of the most engrossing and interesting films of the genre, """"The Shining"""" will always be adored by some and scrutinized by others"
3286;you can see specks of dirt and spots.
3287;i loved this film in the theater.
3288;ambience and mood are perhaps The Shining's strongest features.
3289;The acting of the three main characters is above average.
3290;I believe that the combination of cinematography and music provide a sophisticated experience for any sensitive and sophisticated horror fan.
3291;"the plot, by itself, is in my opinion a rather empty no brainer
3292;this is a great movie.
3293;sit back and dim the lights and enjoy the fun.
3294;This new version, with 5.1 audio, is awesome!
3295;The music is so atmospheric, and moody that it could be a concert in itself.
3296;Excellent direction, masterful acting, and scary script.
3297;I would have enjoyed a full length commentary by Nicholson, or Duvall even, but as it is now, I'll take it!
3298;Jack Nicholson delivers an awesome performance as Jack Torrance in Stephen King's The Shining.
3299;Stanley Kubrick is a genius.
3300;Watch this movie and then, watch it again.
3301;In between one of those viewings watch the movie Room 237.
3302;The scariest things about scary movies to me is their ability to make you go oh my god!
3303;This is one of the top three horror movies ever made and is definitely very scary!
3304;It was an excellent story.
3305;He read this and loved it.
3306;It has been more than 20 years, but I still keep it in my book case.
3307;Though this film is lacking in violence, it is a classic and a must.
3308;Jack Nicholson does an amazing acting job in this movie.
3309;Jack Nicholson's terrific leering insanity, and two little girls who will wander hauntingly through your mind.
3310;Another excellent classical horror film here by Stanley Kubrick.
3311;If you think the book is good then watch the film.
3312;It is a very spooky and tense film which is superb in its television form and people worldwide know the famous saying from the film `HERES JOHNNY`
3313;A classic by all rights, Nicholson is great in this one.
3314;Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining is more of a reimagining of of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than an adaptation.
3315;In my oppinion this is better than the book.
3316;It's scarier, and has more suspense in it.
3317;It is long, but it is worth you time.
3318;This is one of the scariest movies of all time!
3319;I'll tell you a story.
3320;I ran, at a full sprint .
3321;IMO, 'The Shining' is a fantastic movie.
3322;jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers played excellent roles.
3323;wendy and Danny held haunting looks, Jack, mad.
3324;It wouldn't have mattered who wrote The Shining"
3325;it's true King wasn't satisfied with the first Shining film.
3326;mention Steven King and most think, Here's Johnny.
3327;cujo is a good example.
3328;Stephen King's excellent horror novel was essentially a character study of a family coming apart through the weakness of an alchoholic husband driven over the edge in a remote and spooky off.
3329;Yet another classic from my youth.
3330;This is probably one of the best and most remembered horror movies made.
3331;Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance fits just a little too well.
3332;There are many good elements to this sophisticated movie.
3333;One of the creepiest elements of the movie, the maze chase scenes, were completely non.
3334;In a nutshell, this is a movie that belongs in the memory bank of everyone out for a good horror pic.
3335;To me this is the greatest Stephen King book made into a movie EVER!
3336;Nicholson and Duvall are both amazing in this film.
3337;Along with an amazing film score and a really creepy film location this is still one of my all time favorites.
3338;King and director Stanley Kubrick had issues all throughout the filming.
3339;This movie is pretty good, but not for Stephen King fans.
3340;That is, if you've read the book, which I have.
3341;Frustrated writer Jack Torrance takes a job as the winter caretaker at the ominous, mountain.
3342;locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace.
3343;The Shining is a perfect example of how a horror movie should be made.
3344;This movie is chilling to the bone.
3345;And with the novel's original ending that saw the various animals carved out of the maze's hedges coming to life impractical with the special effects of the day, Kubrick's solution is very satisfying even if he does steal one shot wholesale from The Last Hunt.
3346;I have and the differences are not that great, I always thought the book was great and the best King I have read upto now, but I didn't feel it would make a great movie, and was proven right by the mini series that is a carbon copy of the book, and to me it just didn't work.
3347;Jack Nicholson is incredible (As usual NO Oscar, it's a Horror film what did you expect).
3348;The shining allows him to see events from the past and foresee events in the future and speak into other shiners minds.
3349;jack Nicholson is usually always a joy to watch and THE SHINING is no exception.
3350;His portrayal of a man driven mad by alcoholism, mistakes from the past, cabin fever, and a haunted hotel is riveting.
3351;Shelley Duvall pulls of a remarkable job of a wife blinded by false hope to all signs of trouble until it is almost too late.
3352;And Danny Lloyd is a delight to watch as the young boy blessed with a gift to powerful to control.
3353;But, The Shining was a pretty darn good movie.
3354;star cast and a legendary director, it makes for a great film.
3355;Jack Nicholson also leaves his mark on a movie he is in.
3356;libbing to just purely wonderful acting, he can turn a semi good movie into a great movie.
3357;But, Overall The Shining was a highly effective movie that will be remembered by me for a long, long time.
3358;As you see the main character's VW Bug driving to the hotel during the opening credits, there are several great helicopter shots.
3359;In one shot, you can see the shadow of the helicopter on the side of the mountain.
3360;I love The Shining and I saw it for the first time when I was 9 or 10.
3361;The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful.
3362;The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson.
3363;He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later.
3364;He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller.
3365;Great actors make great movies, well mostly.
3366;See this movie or die.
3367;The ghosts wil eat you alive from the inside.
3368;It's as good as The Exercist.
3369;The acting, the directing, the setting, and the soundtrack are spellbinding.
3370;'A great movie to curl up with on a stormy night, if you like the living daylights scared out of you.
3371;This is taking horror, and tossing it, making it realilistic, something to relate to, believe in, instead of something to mock.
3372;So many elements working to create this .
3373;Because you don't catch it often.
3374;How smooth and crisp and unreal she is.
3375;How perfect she comes across.
3376;So that, in itself, it's eerie.
3377;if it sounds cruddy, well, i expect it.
3378;This is my favorite horror movie.
3379;My husband and I love this movie.
3380;This is the greatest movie ever made.
3381;You may find this review minimalist, but that is simply due to the straightfoward (actually, not so straightforward) brilliance of this highly intelligent, and realistic picture.
3382;I oughta watch it again sometime.
3383;Read the book after you see this film SK did an excellent job with this film.
3384;A brilliant film of Stanley Kubrick which builds itself into a crescendo of madness, and horror borne out of the claustraphobic isolation of the family at the overlook hotel.
3385;So Jack moves in with his family (wife and son) to the hotel.
3386;This is a real frightning and freaky movie with non existent gore save for the few illusion seens when Jack and his child see the slain ghost people.
3387;This is a cult classic that sends shivers through your spine.
3388;Best to be seen all alone when no one is in the house and after dark.
3389;And the main fuel of the movie is the spooky acting of Jack Nicholson.
3390;"You are genuinely scared of the character ""Jack Torrance"" that he plays."
3391;He brought such a realistic madness to the role.
3392;Kubrick and Jack Nicholson make this film work.
3393;i am a kid but i know what a good horror movie is.
3394;this is the type of masterpiece that slowly messes with your head.
3395;The acting is what sets this movie apart.
3396;Jack NIcholson is arguably our generation's greatest actor and here he gives a tremendous, energetic, and unforgettable performance.
3397;Nicholson as Jack Torrance is funny, crazy, and scary all at once!
3398;SOme of his scenes are so funny and scary you don't know whether to laugh out loud or scream!
3399;Nicholson would be enough to make this film great but what makes it a classic is all the supporting roles.
3400;Shelly Duvall is fantastic as Wendy, Jack's skinny meek wife who is confronted with a deranged husband and disturbed son in an abandoned snowbound hotel.
3401;is also solid as their 7 year old son Danny.
3402;Amazing performance by this talented little boy just adds believability and fear to the movie.
3403;The atmosphere and the music are absolutely terrifying.
3404;The music just chills your bones!
3405;THis movie is just perfect, absolutely perfect, I can't find a single fault with it, a true American horror masterpiece.
3406;THis is true to an extent.
3407;I've read King's book and it is good.
3408;Kubrick's The Shining is a stunning ghost story with gore and violence thrown in.
3409;I think King should just be happy that Kubrick used his book to make this movie.
3410;It will stand as one of the truly classic and great American films of all time.
3411;In tow is his fragile wife (Shelley Duvall) and susceptible son (Danny Lloyd).
3412;There is always something unsettling about Stanley Kubrick's pictures and this film is pretty creepy.
3413;Regardless this film will remain a classic thriller despite succumbing to a recent remake.
3414;Pulling some fantastic creepy performances out of nowhere are the young Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers who both manage to add a few eerie scenes to their bag of tricks.
3415;You will definitely want to leave the lights on while watching this movie and hope they keep shining bright well past bedtime!
3416;My favorite movie of all time!
3417;I especially like the part where Jack is in the Gold Room the second time.
3418;He is still battling with his alcoholism, his relationship with his wife.
3419;Danny, the boy, can see the future due to his gift.
3420;The maze is a highly effective symbol for the end of the movie, sure it compromises KINGS vision for KUBRICKS, but compromises well.
3421;this movie used to scare the crap out of me when I was real little, I've always been a huge fan of it.
3422;STANLEY KUBRICK was an amazing film maker, check this one out for Halloween.
3423;It's a huge compliment to the movie that I'm shaking from the inside out.
3424;If you watch this movie with an open mind and let it take you.
3425;then my god, will it take you.
3426;This movie is, I think, the scariest film experience next to the Blair Witch Project for me.
3427;This movie succeeds on every level it set out to, and it makes a great, bone marrow freezing experience.
3428;To put it simply, this is the best horror film ever made.
3429;Wow is this movie good.
3430;anyone that has read the book the shining will notice small and sequence changes between the book story and the movie story.
3431;Infact i feel like kubric did a good job of adding and adjusting parts of the plot to make the story more appealing on screen.
3432;In the book Jack Torrance is a family loving man with remorse for what he does.
3433;This change i felt was intelligently done by kubric.
3434;The shining is filled with plenty of action and excitement, and most of all the plot is done well.
3435;Jack Nicholson was absolutely brilliant in this movie and he really made it into the classic that it was.
3436;I loved this movie the action and even some humor was brilliant.
3437;The old woman tub scene was pretty close to any scare that i got in the movie.
3438;Excellent movie 5 stars i give this.
3439;The recent television remake has its merits (particularly in the subtle believable performance of Jack's gradual possession ), as does this theatrical version.
3440;there is a level of detachment and clinical observation that reminds one that the film maker .
3441;the change in the ending from King's novel works well.
3442;it re establishes the sense of unpredictability in the world that informs King's book.
3443;Certainly an outstanding (if uneven )film, Kubrick manages to capture the essence of King's themes while creating a film that distinctly belonged to Kubrick himself.
3444;everything worked perfectly in this movie to create an atmosphere of pure terror.
3445;Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances as Jack Torrance, winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a special gift (The Shining) that can allow him to see things others can't and talk to people without moving his lips.
3446;In addition, a cook also has the Shining.
3447;close shots, and a story of dehumanization.
3448;"It also shows Kubrick's sense of humor, which includes sarcasm (When Jack talks about Danny's knowledge of cannibalism ""."
3449;"when Jack says ""Honey, I'm Home!"")"
3450;The Shining is one of Kubrick's best films and one of the great horror films of all time.
3451;while not true to the book, and limited by the technology of its time, kubrik's version of king's story is both tense and enjoyable with effective portrayals by nicholson and duvall.
3452;Still a fantastic movie even after seeing it 10+ times.
3453;have for fans of classic horror movies and/or Jack Nicholson fans.
3454;Many x and y generationers may find this one holds a particular place in mind, as it may be one of the first that scared you as a kid.
3455;"Jack Nicholson, as always, delivers an great performance as a deranged husband/writer with one of his most memorable movie quotes: ""Here's Johnny""!"
3456;Jack and stanley at their best.
3457;will scare the heck out of you.
3458;After a while his mind starts going wild on him in an evil way.
3459;Cabin fever sets in and his imaginary friends tell him the proper ways to discipline his family.
3460;With the fine acting of Jack Nicholson and the feel of a Stanley Kubrick film, this movie will have an everlasting impact on your psyche.
3461;"Among the seminal and influential horror films is ""The Shining"", which is an undisputed masterpiece, and one of the greatest psychological."
3462;"Be it as lengthy as it is, ""The Shining"" is captivating in every second of its terrifying glory."
3463;"I think one of the reasons ""The Shining"" is so influential is because throughout the entire movie, the characters are continually becoming developed."
3464;"another thing that makes ""The Shining"" such a great and influential horror movie is that it became one of the definitive movies where the location plays just as big a character role as the lead characters."
3465;In this case, The Overlook Hotel, which unfolds the dark and haunting mysteries of its twisted and murderous past, showcases that it plays just as big a role as Jack Nicholson or Shelly Duvall, both of whom are amazing actors here.
3466;The concept of the building playing a charater would later influence such great, modern.
3467;"day psychological horror movies such as the great ""Session 9""."
3468;The Shining is a movie that gives a good reputation to horror, because it's one of those movies that you really have to watch a few times to truly pick up on everything thrown in your direction.
3469;I honestly didn't fully understand everything until the fourth time I saw it, and by then, the movie went from being a puzzling masterpiece to an utterly terrifying masterpiece!
3470;Watching it in the right mood, one can see why this movie made #6 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.
3471;however terrifying this movie may be, it is undoubtedly brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed.
3472;In addition to all of these positives, the scenery and atmosphere are incredible and quite surreal at times, making the movie even better.
3473;"It's for these reasons that make it understandable why ""The Shining"" is one of those horror movies that even non."
3474;"In short, if you're willing to watch a movie's that's quite long and progressive, but heightens in it's intensity and terror until the very end, ""The Shining"" will be a classic for you!"
3475;Thanks for the time, and peace.
3476;I like Stanley's other movies quite a bit though.
3477;The Shining is one of the greatest films I've ever watched.
3478;Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece showcases some of the most suspenseful movie moments ever to be seen, and Jack Nicholson's character is simply amazing.
3479;One cannot deny that Kubrick's vision of THE SHINING is brilliant.
3480;Jack Nicholson is spot on as the father who is slowly going mad.
3481;Shelly Duvall plays his wife, and while I think they could have chosen someone better to play this role, she pulls it off adequately.
3482;the marketing of the movie itself has a life of its own.
3483;"One Aussie reviewer states that the edited version is ""nicely paced with more energy""."
3484;Best viewed on a standard TV.
3485;By wisely shifting attention from Danny and his 'special gift' and focusing on Jack going insane and terrorizing his family, Kubrick has made a powerful statement about what occurs when man is cut off from the world outside, made into an insular beast, and how he must lose his mind to escape.
3486;Jack Nicholson's slavering performance is a masterful tour.
3487;force, never have I had such fun watching a human being unravel!
3488;Stanley Kubrick's direction, as usual, is meticulous.
3489;From his brilliant employment of the steadicam (those halls, the snowy banks outside) to his ability to make the horrific seem lovely ( the slow, gushing tidal waves of blood, his use of crystal clear, clean white light and grand sweeping shots of the hotel's interiors) the director has made what is probably the best looking horror film ever.
3490;Forget the quibbles about length, plot focus and emphasis on Jack, just enjoy the scenery, the the mystiqe, the suspense and marvel at Mr. Kubrick's genius.
3491;is a wonderful, insightful moment.
3492;So is the footage of Kubrick directing Shelley Duvall, the cast rehearsing lines in the cavernous kitchen set, and the various interviews with cast members.
3493;like Barry Lyndon before it, The Shining seems to be, in part, an experiment.
3494;Oddly, the other Kubrick film it is most like is 2001: A Space Odyssey.
3495;The clich is true: in some ways it is a thinking.
3496;the Shining works on at least two levels.
3497;On the surface, we have the populist, iconic imagery .
3498;At the end, Kubrick even has fun with us by doing something we would not expect of him .
3499;In this respect, The Shining owes more to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness than to Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th.
3500;the film the subconscious sees .
3501;began to take hold, and The Shining started to haunt our collective dreams.
3502;In a quiet moment, the memory of Danny Torrance wheeling his tricycle through the corridors of the Overlook will bubble up, and bring a genuine chill we may not have even felt when first we saw it.
3503;The Shining is most effective for its after.
3504;Despite Stanley Kubrick's blatant disregard for the integrity of Stephen King's work, The Shining is great on its own.
3505;I saw this as a kid before I had ever read the book and was in awe of how frightening and real everything seemed.
3506;ray to see things better.
3507;I bought this with Prime and got it very quickly!
3508;music (mainly by the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok) and camerawork are the chief contributors to the atmosphere of a film which is one of the few genuinely frightening I have experienced.
3509;I especially love looking for hidden mistakes and make up conspiracy theories!
3510;This is a must watch!
3511;This movie was amazingly creepy, it was simply a great movie.
3512;Jack nicholson is simply perfect in his role of a possesed man.
3513;Badly adapted from book but still great.
3514;The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is arguably one of the best horror films ever made.
3515;The performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence is both haunting and mesmerizing, and is one that I will never forget.
3516;I recommend it to anyone who wants to see great acting and cinematography at work, as Kubrick truly makes this film something to remember.
3517;packed novels compared to most of his others.
3518;as with most of King's flics, which are, generally.
3519;The movie omits some of the novel's best moments, and when the movie DOESN'T omit suspenseful moments from the book, it either shows it in a very cheesy, unsuspenseful manner and/or doesn't follow the book accurately.
3520;"acted performance of his entire carreer, and made by one Mr. Kubrick who, in my book, is the most overrated director ever to emerge on the surface of this earth?Chopping away with an axe, grinning into the camera and crying out ""Wooohaaah!"""
3521;First, let me say that I love this movie.
3522;It's the best horror film ever made.
3523;See, the problem is with Warner!!!!!
3524;well, u get the point.
3525;BETTER than a tape, extras, and just damn great.
3526;I'll always love this film, if you haven't seen it.
3527;Many reviewers of this fabulous movie, who read the book first, throw around the adjectives Atrocious , and Disappointing , without even realizing that this is perhaps the scariest and most terrifying movie that has ever been produced.
3528;This is just a horribly terrifying movie, with superb acting, an incredible location, and was directed by the most prolific director to ever exist, Stanley Kubrick.
3529;Funny but it was a family night movie.
3530;In terms of classic horror films, this one is a must.
3531;"for a basic plot summary, ""The Shining"" tells the story of the Torrence family, who are assigned to ""house."
3532;easily the high point of this film is Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly being driven completely insane.
3533;With the facial expressions and extreme physical moods/movements that Nicholson brings to every role, he provides the most chilling scenes of the entire experience.
3534;overall, I have now viewed this movie three times, and enjoyed it a little less each time.
3535;In all honesty, I enjoyed the King novel more, and would recommend it (if not for the brilliant Nicholson) over this Kubrick version.
3536;Jack Nicholson is the perfect psycho next to the damsel in distress played awesomely by Shelley Duvall.
3537;I am also a fan of Jack Nicholson.
3538;The reason he wants this job is because he is a writer and this hotel he will be working at is huge and isolated at night, so he can focus on his writing.
3539;His son has the gift of Extrasensory perception.
3540;"overall, ""The Shinning"" has good acting by Jack Nicholson."
3541;He is the reason why the film earns 4 stars.
3542;The plot is also good, but I think this is the case where the book is better then the film.
3543;The Shining is the best horror film ever!
3544;Jack Nicholson's porformance is over the top.
3545;The transfer on Blu ray is perfect.
3546;last time I watched it was 20 years ago, and after such time I got scared again.
3547;A really truly masterpiece of horror.
3548;A great remaster of a timeless classic.
3549;The remastering allows for breathtakingly beautiful wide shots of the natural surroundings.
3550;The hotel literally screams with vibrant color.
3551;Great extras and behind the scenes.
