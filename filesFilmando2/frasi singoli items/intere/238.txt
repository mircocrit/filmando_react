I:297;1;British period pieces all carry the same themes.
I:297;2;"Two kindred hearts fight either for or against each other throughout the entire film until finally one succumbs and we are left with the clich ""happy"" ending."
I:297;3;Either way, even with the greatest players having fun with their roles, Impromptu slowly flushes itself down the period.
I:297;4;Impromptu kept me awake and excited about what would happen next entirely due to the characters.
I:297;5;"Some may laugh at the portrayal of Chopin by Hugh Grant, but he contains himself well and shows that he may have some acting ""chops"" under that flopsy hair of his (even with his fading German accent)."
I:297;6;"Judy Davis did well with her character, I just have trouble with her ""I need to win an Oscar with every role"" type performance that Davis is notorious for giving us with every film."
I:297;7;When all of these actors are together on screen, especially during their sinister performance at Thompson's house, one cannot help but be pulled into their world.
I:297;8;"Excitement, humor, and an aura of charisma surround these characters, alas
I:297;9;"She has amazing characters, funny situations, and socially challenged themes
I:297;10;From the beginning it is established that these are some of the greatest minds in British history together on screen, so why did we have to pace through the film as if they were also the oldest characters in history.
I:297;11;Here we have the amazing opportunity to witness a great author and the rarity of cross.
I:297;12;Not a screamingly successful film.
I:297;13;Impromptu is one of those films that you hear about.
I:297;14;an underground following, and an incredible good time.
I:297;15;judy Davis shines (as always) as authoress George Sand, a masculine woman writer who falls in love with the feminine pianist Chopin (played by Hugh Grant).
I:297;16;Some fabulous writing here, and a chance for Judy Davis to let herself go and have fun.
I:297;17;The script wouldn't exactly be Oscar nominated, but it is cleverly written, and the charactors are just too much fun.
I:297;18;each offering their own unique talents to keeping the film together.
I:297;19;It was fun to see so many serious actors playing comedic roles.
I:297;20;A very young Hugh Grant plays a pretty good Chopin.
I:297;21;On the one hand, the actors played their roles perfectly, IMO.
I:297;22;A film I adore, which captures a period of time when literature and art were revered.
I:297;23;The actors are superb, from Emma Thompson as the rich country baroness to Judy Davis as George Eliot.
I:297;24;Mandy Panikin was amusing and so adroit playing the part of her rejected lover.
I:297;25;Because the title suggests energy and abruptness, the movie itself laughs along its way.
I:297;26;Nice performances for all the characters not mentioned here.
I:297;27;All in all, an entertaining period piece with a heroine who goes after her man.
I:297;28;This was much more enlightening .
I:297;29;And Chopin was equally fascinating.
I:297;30;this is a sweet movie keeps you interested.
I:297;31;I like Hugh Grant and I recommend it to all.
I:297;32;My grandchild likes it too
I:297;33;I really loved this love story and I love romantic period music.
I:297;34;George Sands is delightfully rakish and I love her pursuit of Chopin.
I:297;35;Lush scenery, clever character dialogue, exquisite music.
I:297;36;It was from this movie that my love for George Sand's writing came to be.
I:297;37;"In the movie, the quote from her love letter to Chopin is actually from her novel ""Mauprat""."
I:297;38;It is a superb read.
I:297;39;while the screenplay takes quite a bit of poetic license, this all.
I:297;40;star ensemble absolutely nails it!If you have any interest in period pieces, Chopin or Sand.
I:297;41;do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
I:297;42;I loved every minute of this movie.
I:297;43;Her soul is revived, however, upon hearing the beautiful music of the young composer, Chopin.
I:297;44;The dialogue is lovely, the storyline and plot have an excellent flow, and not only is the entire thing romantic, funny, and interesting, it's ridiculously sexy.
I:297;45;this movie has everything from jilted lovers and true loves, to undertones of feminism and brilliant artists.
I:297;46;Impromptu is one of my favourite films because it has an excellent cast, beautiful period costumes, great cinematography, and I can't leave out the exceptionally beautiful soundtrack!
I:297;47;Chopin and Liszt music flow throughout the scenes and Hugh Grant pulls off a believable Chopin.
I:297;48;If you enjoy period dramas, history, historical fiction and romantic classical music .
I:297;49;Playing a neurotic, brilliant hypochondriac with a Chopinian accent is right up his alley in this film.
I:297;50;Judy Davis as the famous popular woman writer of the time period, George Sand, is also fabulous.
I:297;51;As is Mandy Patinkin, who Princess Bride fans will know as the sword.
I:297;52;carried out, and if you think you'd enjoy watching a film about all that can go wrong (and right) amid a commune of writers and artists, this is a film you want to see as soon as possible!
I:297;53;This movie is one of my top 10 favorites.
I:297;54;It is funny, funny, funny, but in a crisp and understated way that makes each viewing funnier than the last.
I:297;55;It shows the foibles of the characters with amusement, but without quite wandering into satire.
I:297;56;The love scenes are squirm.
I:297;57;Soundtrack is a winner with music by Chopin and Liszt.
I:297;58;It's not much of a comedy but it's a beautiful, light movie about George Sand and Chopin.
I:297;59;You'll see many beautiful scenes and you'll enjoy lots of good music.
I:297;60;The acting is fantastic, I enjoyed every second of it.
I:297;61;Yes, and they're all worthy, but Judy Davis steals the show and then some.
I:297;62;hearted take on the romance between George Sand and Chopin, it has many wonderful moments but shares some of its characters' mean.
I:297;63;And while not consistently engaging, Hugh is quite amusing and Judy is magnificent as the romantic, high.
I:297;64;This movie should be good.
I:297;65;I enjoyed the performances by Emma Thompson and Bernadette Peters more than those of the lead characters.
I:297;66;"James Lepine's ""Impromptu"" (1991) retells the story of Chopin (Hugh Grant) and George Sand (a terrific, intense Judy Davis) and how they met."
I:297;67;Filmed on location in France, it seems more realistic.
I:297;68;The surprise is Hugh Grant, who is a dandy Chopin.
I:297;69;The acting is great and scenery is wonderful.
I:297;70;A delightful movie on the affair between George Sand and Frederick Chopin that is very entertaining.
I:297;71;The cast was good, story, not so much.
I:297;72;Impromptu is a amusing and clever portrayal of the 19th century love affair between composer Frederic Chopin and French romance author George Sand, the pen name of baroness Aurore Dudevant.
I:297;73;Eventually, he becomes as captivated with her gift of prose as she is with his music, and they fall in love.
I:297;74;She completely domintaes the relationship, but is nevertheless proves herself a loyal and loving companion.
I:297;75;chomping personality she is so well known for.
I:297;76;impromptu is a tender love story laden with slapstick.
I:297;77;Everything about this movie is pure, unadulterated fun .
I:297;78;the characters, their madness, and the antics of George Sand as she seeks to secure Chopin's affection.
I:297;79;Have fun with this one.
I:297;80;good movie, but not excellent.
I:297;81;All is kept light and airy by a tremendous cast that includes Judy Davis, Hugh Grant, Mandy Patinkin, Bernadette Peters and Emma Thompson.
I:297;82;"Simply wonderful
I:297;83;Excellent account of the time and the people involved.
I:297;84;the movie is shot beutifully and the acting is superb.
I:297;85;Great performances by Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson.
I:297;86;I absolutely recommend you see it if you haven't already.
I:297;87;great acting on the part of Hugh Grant and Judy Davis!
I:297;88;"I have never read the history regarding the relationship between George Sand and Chopin
I:297;89;The cast was superb, which doesn't always work with so many stars in one cast.
I:297;90;This is a good fun movie with humor that I recommend watching.
I:297;91;The best part of this film I think.
I:297;92;characters are beautiful and believable.
I:297;93;Some display all of the worst traits but they do it with style.
I:297;94;Just when I was mulling over the conundrum why there is no good film on Chopin's life, I ran into this title from 1991, with a well.
I:297;95;Both films are plausible, both films are interesting and offer music better than Bach's and Mozart's.
I:297;96;I feel that a certain dispense from the facts is acceptable, so far as they remain relevant, and conducive to the development of the story and in this case, the humour.
I:297;97;emma Thompson has proven time and again, her mastery of period drama and her multi.
I:297;98;judy Davis and Bernadette Peters are truly brilliant and entertaining in their convincing and riveting portrayals of Sand (whom you love to emphatize with) and D'Agoult (whom you love to hate), eventually placed at loggerheads.
I:297;99;The dialogue is much more hilarious than the original in English!
I:297;100;the soundtracks are strung together in a most admirable fashion, beginning most lightheartedly with Chopin's fleeting.
I:297;101;"lush orchestrations have been ""mixed"" in certain parts with the original solo piano excerpts to enhance the dramatic flow."
I:297;102;overall, it is a film I would recommend without hesitation to lovers of classical music, historical drama and comedy.
I:297;103;and I usually love these types of films.
I:297;104;This movie, an embellished account of the romance between George Sand (a strong, independent woman before such a thing was fashionable) and Frederic Chopin (the famous but delicate and sickly composer) is truly witty, charming, wonderful and thoroughly entertaining!!
I:297;105;And the score, primarily Chopin and Liszt, is the icing on the cake.
I:297;106;i've seen it at least 20 times (to make sure all my friends and family could enjoy it as well) but my enjoyment never fades and the ideas and emotions expressed about art, propriety, love and the masculine/feminine still ring true.
I:297;107;A movie that does a good job of encapsulating the characters and fashion of Fredrik Chopin's time in 1800's Paris.
I:297;108;The dialog is witty and the pace of the movie is quick.
I:297;109;The movie is funny, the costumes lush and the music, of course heavenly.
I:297;110;I accept that a filmmaker will take considerable liberties in order to get his story across in less than two hours.
I:297;111;Judy Davis is amazing, while Hugh Grant performs competently.
I:297;112;Besides passion, there is abundant wit and humor.
I:297;113;This movie richly deserves being owned.
I:297;114;She takes Emma Thompson, who delivered a superb performance, to task.
I:297;115;This is a comedy, and the buffoonery is distributed irregardless of gender.
I:297;116;sand, the heroine, is depicted quite favorably by Impromptu, with pluck and daring.
I:297;117;The author disparages the wit of the movie, considering it unnecessary, but this is one of its charms.
I:297;118;There is not a single redundant character, and every character introduced entertains and instructs in their own way, despite being caricatures or buffoons.
I:297;119;This is a truly Romantic version of love which transcends the physical, much like Chopin himself, whose body was feeble (he was to die of tuberculosis in his thirties).
I:297;120;Listening to the dialogue once again confirms in my mind how well the movie captures the spirit of Romanticism, which Chopin and Sand both embodied in their own ways.
I:297;121;the central mistake the Amazonian reviewer made was to approach this movie with expectations about Hugh Grant, Hollywood's favorite, a good.
I:297;122;It is the best movie ever made to my knowledge.
I:297;123;It's a good thing it was free with Amazon Prime.
I:297;124;Some dialog is a bit out of character for the times but it is very well done.
I:297;125;Judy Davis is just what I always thought George Sand would be like.
I:297;126;Julian Sands is a perfect Franz Lizst and Bernadette Peters' acting is spot on for her character.
I:297;127;There are many laughable twist and turns as well as interesting points of calculated deception.
I:297;128;Impromptu is a very funny movie with a phenomenal cast.
I:297;129;liferomance between the writer George Sand, played by Judy Davis in mostly men's clothing,and Chopin, the composer.
I:297;130;I loved Judy Davis and Hugh Grant in this movie.
I:297;131;Using fairly accurate historical material, this thoroughly modern take on some of the nineteenth century's most colorful authors, painters and musicians is touching, very funny and insightful.
I:297;132;Impromptu is my favorite all time movie.
I:297;133;It well written, well acted by a flock of fine performers and it's funny plus being historically accurateand filled with beautiful music.
I:297;134;Together they make a great pair of movies for a weekend.
I:297;135;Very enjoyable period romance/biotic/dramedy based on the real events, portrays truly famous, and even legendary figures of 19th Century culture such as George Sand, nee Aurora Dupin, Frederick Chopin, Franz Listz, Eugene Delacroix, and Alfred De Musset.
I:297;136;The main heroine (or the hero) of the film is George Sand, who is equally known for her Romantic novels and her quite scandalous at the time way of life.
I:297;137;class society, to leave her husband, take two children with her, make a living with her writing, and especially to show up in public wearing men clothing and openly smocking .
I:297;138;Her contemporary, the Russian ex.
I:297;139;"patriot, famous novelist Ivan Turgenev said about her ""What a brave man she was, and what a good woman."""
I:297;140;It tells the story of the romance between strong and full of life George Sand and very talented romantic composer, Frederic Chopin whose music made her fall in love with him even before they met in person.
I:297;141;Hugh Grant in one of his earlier roles as young Polish composer and virtuoso piano.
I:297;142;needless to say that the film is filled with the captivating music, charming costumes, and gorgeous locations.
I:297;143;It is a hidden treasure and I am glad to have finally discovered it.4/5
I:297;144;This movie is a perfect study on the subject.
I:297;145;"There are few movies about human condition and being in that ""moment"" that there is so much talk about, that are true pieces of art at the same time, like ""Impromptu""."
I:297;146;The chemistry between the two is remarkable.
I:297;147;Emma Thompson has a small role and does it to perfection.
I:297;148;The piano playing, mostly dubbed by Emmanuel Ax, is wonderful.
I:297;149;Most surprising of all, the story was actually pretty accurate, though the role of Liszt's mistress may have been overplayed.
I:297;150;One of the best movies I've seen lately.
I:297;151;It wasn't the best movie, but it was very funny, great early Hugh Grant in the role of Frydyryk Chopin, Judy Davis, Bernadette Peters, and Emma Thompson are always fantastic.
I:297;152;Julian Sands as Franz Lizst was a treat as well.
I:297;153;I know it was fictionalised but it was nice to see the developing relationship between the composer and the novelist, George Sand.
I:297;154;Overall, I recommend it to anyone who loves classical music and period dramas, with a sense of humour.
I:297;155;It's an entertaining film .
I:297;156;"the camera is a real peeping Tom which allows the viewer to know the most intimate details in the social life 
I:297;157;"the double moral 
I:297;158;jules Davis made an incredible performance as George Sand and Hugh Grant made a Chopin with certain peaks and lows .
I:297;159;Julian Sand is splendid as the handsome and outrageous hungarian musician.
I:297;160;wonderful locations in France and excellent artistic direction.
I:297;161;This has to be one of my all time favorites.
I:297;162;It is a wonderful, funny, romantic look at the beginning of the relationship between Chopin and Georges Sand.
I:297;163;Judy Davis is a marvel as Sand, conniving, volatile, loving.
I:297;164;Hugh Grant at the beginning of his career invests Chopin with an otherworldly charm that is unforgettable.
I:297;165;The whole cast is marvelous.
I:297;166;Do yourself a favor and watch this wonderful film.
I:297;167;It will take you to another world for a few hours.
I:297;168;I really enjoyed this movie, largely due to the performance of the not.yet.
I:297;169;The movie gives a sense of the times and the relationship between the characters.
I:297;170;Like I said, this a great period piece with terrific music.
I:297;171;It was not too heavy and it was enjoyable.
I:297;172;Not a lot of plot, but very pretty with beautiful music.
I:297;173;Some good actors (Hugh Grant is absurdly young) having a wonderful time hamming it up in period costumes.
I:297;174;The movie was well acted.
I:297;175;I am a fan of Chopin and My wife is madly in love with Hugh Grant.
I:297;176;If so, it is worth watching for its historical viewpoint.
I:297;177;Enjoyed the music,costuming and scenery.
I:297;178;I loved all the jane austen movies and this was in that same genre loved it!
I:297;179;And i love hugh grant :)
I:297;180;Impromptu is truly one of the great little.
I:297;181;end is the beginning of the famous Sand.
I:297;182;It is more fantasy than fact, but it is hilariousy funny, wonderfully romantic, and beautifully filmed.
I:297;183;Directed by James Lapine with the gorgeous music of Chopin and Liszt.
I:297;184;Mr. Grant is perfection as Chopin, and Miss Davis matches him all the way.
I:297;185;Miss Peters is at her zany best.
I:297;186;This film is truly a treasure.
I:297;187;I love period pieces so I thought I'd give this one a whirl.
I:297;188;Probably due to all the infidelity.
I:297;189;This is an excellent film which depicts with some humor and intrigue the life of Chopin.
I:297;190;Hugh Grant and Judy Davis play fantastic parts.
I:297;191;One actually gets a feel for the era in which Chopin lived.
I:297;192;The music is stupendous and invites an even greater appreciation for Chopin's talents.
I:297;193;(And i'm a big Mandy Patinkin fan by the way)A very non.
I:297;194;I went into this movie not expecting much but was treated to a funny and reasonably well done movie.
I:297;195;the move led me to wanting to learn more about the real people the actors portrayed.
I:297;196;Not that all historically accurate, but still a great entertaining movie!
I:297;197;like the majority of European sellers do when an American order is received !
I:297;198;Works as a date movie, but it's really just a good movie in general.
I:297;199;It would take some research to determine how much of this story is history and how much is wild imagination.
I:297;200;It is a good setting to listen to a lot of good Chopin music.
I:297;201;also, this movie covers a very short period of time, like possibly couple of years, in the life of George Sand, from the time she meets Chopin and hears his music to the time they travel to Majorca together with her children.
I:297;202;but, still i loved this movie.
I:297;203;however, i will keep my ears and eyes open for that great movie about the great one and only.
I:297;204;chopin, who in my mind deserves so much more.
I:297;205;I love period historical dramas!
I:297;206;Just watch it for what it is.
I:297;207;Lots of fun, acting ranges from subtle to scenery chewing yet it all works as an ensemble costume drama with many comic moments.
I:297;208;Although its a bit dated, the movie has wonderful costumes and gives an interesting version of composer Chopin and author Gerge Sands.
I:297;209;Impromptu is well acted and an interesting piece of history.
I:297;210;Fascinating interplay between Chopin, a brilliant, passionate but delicate man, and George Sand, a brilliant, passionate and indelicate woman.
I:297;211;I love period piece movies.
I:297;212;This one had a great untold story of Chopin.
I:297;213;This is a wonderful film about Frederic Chopin and George Sands.
I:297;214;Hugh Grant is a rather handsome Chopin, overall a most enjoyable film.
I:297;215;I love this kind of filmsWonderful acting, in particular the two protagonist.
I:297;216;I appreciate we can enjoy this kind of films trough Amazon Prime
I:297;217;wit, grace, charm, and granted yes, somewhat affected performances, but still a sweetness manages to come through.
I:297;218;love music, eternal muses, are showcased in their manic, most evocative forms here are captured in all their energy wit of an era of change, challenge growth culturally.
I:297;219;I bought this movie to see Hugh Grant as Chopin and was surprised with it.
I:297;220;absolutely sublime music was it self the main character.
I:297;221;if you know that era and the characters who made real difference in the arts, you will enjoy watching this.
I:297;222;This Masterpiece Theater production of the love story between novelist George Sand and composer Frederic Chopin is funny, well.
I:297;223;It is played out in this film mostly for fun.
I:297;224;His retrenchment at Sand's initial overtures is done tastefully and with powerful historic accuracy.
I:297;225;the supporting cast is wonderful in this film.
I:297;226;Bernadette Peters is in fine form as mother to Lizst's children with her own agenda on Chopin.
I:297;227;Mandy Patinkin steals scenes regularly in his portrayl as Sands' lover and father of her children, while Ralph Brown does good work as Chopin's real life friend, the French revolutionary artist Eugene Delacroix.
I:297;228;Emma Thompson also plays a very funny role in the cast.
I:297;229;movies about classical musicians are never based in humor and are rarely as successful as this one.
I:297;230;people that love classical music and/or 19th century period reenactments, and people that enjoy subtle humor, will all get a kick from this movie.
I:297;231;Watched this movie twice, and it captured my heart.
I:297;232;Grant played an incredible leading role in this one.
I:297;233;This film centers around the bold and controversial nineteenth century author, George Sand, an unconventional woman who dressed as a man and flouted the social and sexual mores of her day.
I:297;234;It is a wickedly funny film: sharp, biting, and clever.
I:297;235;Leaving a trail of outraged lovers in her wake, she devotes herself, heart and soul, to making Chopin her lover.
I:297;236;This makes for some wickedly madcap moments.
I:297;237;As her quarry makes Ms. Sand pull out all the stops, the viewer will be delightfully entertained by their antics.
I:297;238;judy Davis is sublime as the controversial Ms. Sand, infusing the role with intelligence and charm.
I:297;239;Hugh Grant is perfect in the role of Chopin, who is overwhelmed by the persistent Ms. Sand.
I:297;240;Emma Thompson, in one of her earlier roles, is absolutely hilarious as the Duchess D'Artan, the patroness of the arts, playing her character with complete comedic relish.
I:297;241;The rest of the supporting ensemble also provide stellar performances.
I:297;242;All in all, this is a very enjoyable and unusual period piece.
I:297;243;It is witty and humorous with a great cast.
I:297;244;This movie was surprisingly funny and very interesting.
I:297;245;If you like period pieces then this is a movie for you.
I:297;246;Hugh Grant gave a superb performance as Chopin and the banter between him and Judy Davis was very entertaining.
I:297;247;This is a fun movie.
I:297;248;Good story line, great music.
I:297;249;I enjoyed this, a little bit of action, little bit of romance, all in the time period I love.
I:297;250;I highly recommend this movie.
I:297;251;Not the best movie but if you are interested in Chopin and the relationship between artists of his time then it is worth watching.
I:297;252;With such great acting, outrageously funny plot and exquisite music, no matter that it's only remotely historical.
I:297;253;And with all its silliness, it also has some interesting character revelations.
I:297;254;Set around the 1830's, Impromptu is an interesting story of the bold and witty authoress, George Sands (Judy Davis)and her relationship with Chopin.
I:297;255;George is a strong woman with much character, which attracts many lovers.
I:297;256;She often dresses up as a man and smokes cigars.
I:297;257;She knows what she wants out of life and is not afraid to get it.
I:297;258;Hugh Grant plays Chopin, her love interest, his piano pieces stir her soul like nothing else has done in her life.
I:297;259;despite that, overall Impromptu is an entertaining romp and period piece.
I:297;260;Allow me to begin this review by stating that this film is absolutely superb.
I:297;261;It portrays the greatest artists of 19th Century France (George Sand, De Musset, Chopin, Delacroix, and Liszt), yet it does not take itself too seriously (read: it is not pretentious, in spite of the great historical and artistic characters it depicts).
I:297;262;hearted, charming, and positively delightful.
I:297;263;"Judy Davis is sensational in the role of George Sand, the great and wonderfully unusual literary heroine of 19th Century France
I:297;264;"Hugh Grant is such a great actor when he adopts roles which are worthy of his talent (read: not the tepid and trivial roles which he plays in ""Nine Months"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), and he displays his remarkable talent in portraying the fragile and finicky Chopin."
I:297;265;All of the actors turn in outstanding performances, especially Julian Sands as Liszt, and Bernadette Peters, as his mistress and a close friend of Sand's, Marie d'Agoult, a tempestuous and difficult woman who ultimately betrays Sand.
I:297;266;And fall in love they do, after a series of mishaps and fiascos (some of them quite humorous). . . George Sand was an extremely straightforward and impassioned woman in regard to love, and she actively pursued Chopin.
I:297;267;At first, Chopin is unnerved by Sand's unabashed romantic advances (for he is an individual of great delicacy and piety), but ultimately he comes to view Sand as the truly remarkable woman that she is.
I:297;268;"He was the ""greatest love of her life"" (as biographies on Sand maintain, and indeed she says so in her own autobiography, ""Story of My Life""), and she remained by his side until he succumbed to tuberculosis."
I:297;269;Impromptu ends with their well.
I:297;270;"known trip to Majorca, with a memorable scene in which she opens the windows to the carriage that is carrying them away, in spite of his coughing (""Someone has to teach you how to breathe!"""
I:297;271;Impromptu is a gorgeous film, with breathtaking cinematography, and it pays remarkable homage (and again, without pretention) to the artists whose lives it portrays.
I:297;272;Yes, THE Chopin, the classical music genius.
I:297;273;Anyway, it was a delightful film and at times a bit slow.
I:297;274;Loved the fact it was shot mostly in France and at times it had its funny moments.
I:297;275;Watch this film on a drizzly Sunday afternoon with a bowl of popcorn.
I:297;276;This movie was well done and pretty faithful to the biographical information of Chopin I had read.
I:297;277;It was well developed and while not covering his life to the last, it was indeed entertaining and enlightening.
I:297;278;I am a Hugh Grant fan, so I was drawn to watch just because of him.
I:297;279;I like period movies, as well, so that was another draw.
I:297;280;Impromptu is a delightful historical romance about the long, tumultuous love affair between composer Frederick Chopin and novelist George Sand.
I:297;281;None of this much matters, though, because the movie doesn't pretend to be strictly accurate historically and because it does a good job of capturing the spirit of the times and of its characters.
I:297;282;judy Davis is marvelous as George Sand, a brilliant, eccentric woman who eschewed the social mores of her time.
I:297;283;Both Sand and Peters have substantial supporting roles, as do Emma Thompson and Mandy Patinkin.
I:297;284;"The cast alone makes ""Impromptu"" worth seeing."
I:297;285;Also enjoyable is the soundtrack, almost all of which is taken from Chopin's works.
I:297;286;As entertainment, it's first rate.
I:297;287;Truly amazing characterizations and reall beauty to tge music
I:297;288;Davis, Grant and Sand were at the top of their game.
I:297;289;A very well produced movie.
I:297;290;James Lapine is best known as a playwright and director.
I:297;291;He is most famous for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim including Sunday in the Park with George, Passion and Into the Woods.
I:297;292;He brings this talent to the big screen.
I:297;293;george Sand was a great French writer.
I:297;294;She wrote under a man's name and dressed like a man.
I:297;295;She treated men as playthings.
I:297;296;this is a brilliant romantic comedy with a cast of up and coming actors.
I:297;297;This is another great meaty role for Judy and she eats it up.
I:297;298;Hugh Grant was a relative unknown when this film was made but this film would be the first of the quintessential Hugh Grant characters.
I:297;299;if you are looking for something witty and intelligent, Impromptu is definitely the film to watch.
I:297;300;This is an ok movie.
I:297;301;love the genre, love the actors, didn't like this movie.
I:297;302;I'm a pianist and fan of Chopin and loved peeking into his life.
I:297;303;The story was full of eccentric, artsy characters all played by well know actors and actresses.
I:297;304;I know they had to have fun doing this movie.
I:297;305;If you don't know much about Chopin or the artists of that time period you would still enjoy this movie.
I:297;306;You have a great cast, admirable production and producer/directors of note.
I:297;307;Have read book about Chopin and not quite sure this movie is totally accurate.
I:297;308;in any case, the film was wonderfully written, acted, directed, photographed, etc.
I:297;309;I enjoyed the acting and the way it was presented.
I:297;310;Definitely not worth the time used to watch.
I:297;311;I enjoyed the story and the actors were good.
I:297;312;Scenery, set design and costuming were proper for the period and believable.
I:297;313;NOTHING like the normal period drama I love.
I:297;314;A fun and imaginative movie about the relationship between Chopin and George Sand (Aurora Dupin).
I:297;315;Not historically accurate but it is a comic romance so who cares?
I:297;316;Wonderful performances by all involved.
I:297;317;The cinematography was worth watching the movie for as the film was made in France on location.
I:297;318;I love horses and that detail made my day.
I:297;319;I was so inspired by this movie I have since read two of George Sand's novels and have always loved Chopin's music.
I:297;320;BTW the movie is filled with Chopin's music.
I:297;321;Pretty fanciful in a lot of areas as well.
I:297;322;It also affected some the musical passages.
I:297;323;A light and frothy, inconsequential but enjoyable romantic comedy about the romance between Frederic Chopin and George Sand.
I:297;324;The narrative is somewhat undisciplined, but there a number of comic episodes and the performances are good.
I:297;325;Truly a delight for the eyes and ears, even if it won't stay with you long after finishing it.
I:297;326;Hugh Grant is a fine actor and Mz.
I:297;327;This 1991 movie directed by James Lepine is an absolute charm.
I:297;328;It's a romantic comedy, it's a historical piece and a colorful introduction to the music of Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt and the life and writings of Madame George Sand Aurore Dudevant.
I:297;329;The romantic comedy is well.
I:297;330;notch performances and the music is heaven.
I:297;331;I don't know yet if there is a soundtrack but it's likely there is and it must be beautiful.
I:297;332;She had many lovers, including Alfred De Musset (who is played in this film by Mandy Patinkin)and her most famous lover, Frederic Chopin.
I:297;333;It is their love story that this movie focues on.
I:297;334;judi Davis is doing an Oscar winning performance as George Sand, who is ultimately a woman who belongs to no one and who lives life to the fullest.
I:297;335;She has raised children to be as creative as she is and taken full responsibility for her children as well as for her elderly mother.
I:297;336;lover of Sand shows up.
I:297;337;While she is free, intense, devil.
I:297;338;care and very healthy, Chopin is reserved, emotional, sensitive, refined and suffering of bad health with tubercolosis.
I:297;339;Bernadette Peters delivers a terrific performance as well as the scheming and bitter Marie D'Agoult, whose own marriage to Franz Liszt after having many children with him, including Cosima who later marries Richard Wagner, but that's another story and even another movie.
I:297;340;done movie with lots of charm and witty scenes.
I:297;341;She pursued him like a man pursues a woman.
I:297;342;I truly enjoyed this movie.
I:297;343;I am a fan of the music of Frederic Chopin and I have seen other movies that tell his story.
I:297;344;Although this is not a true story it is a fun movie to watch.
I:297;345;I enjoy the music that is played throughout.
I:297;346;The casting for Franz Listz (Julian Sands) was the best.
I:297;347;A look at the sinful, corrupt ways of the French Aristocracy, This portrayal of the social atmosphere surrounding Chopin and frank Litz is interesting.
I:297;348;I enjoy these period time movies.
I:297;349;I love the musical score as well.
I:297;350;Loved the cinematography and beautiful sets.
I:297;351;Ohhhhhh and the music and the art and the love!!!!!!
I:297;352;Not one of Grants or Davis' better movies, but a pleasant enough little movie for a diversion.
I:297;353;And it is spiced with the music of Chopin.
I:297;354;Chopin and Sand made a brief appearance.
I:297;355;I was 13 and I was inspired, I loved the music.
I:297;356;Impromptu also has many lovely piano pieces, but the people are much more engaged and realistic,especially the women.
I:297;357;pregnant countess mistress of Liszt, were amazing women living unusual lives.
I:297;358;The cast is wonderful, though I think Hugh Grant is weak as Chopin.
I:297;359;I like Chopin and I love Hugh Grant, but Judy Davis was the captivator in this one.
I:297;360;What spunk and daring, but also what romantic depth!
I:297;361;It was a great story, and they portrayed the social norms of the day as well as a nice expo of the relationships between the amazing musicians of this era .
I:297;362;their friendships, their rivalries, and their personalities.
I:297;363;He plays a significant role in Chopin's music and social life.
I:297;364;I learned a lot and enjoyed it all!
I:297;365;I like how he brings a sense of humor into the story line and this movie did not disappoint.
I:297;366;The acting is very good, but the storyline was hard to follow.
I:297;367;It is delightful to see such a refreshingly witty and playful film.
I:297;368;Judy Davis is wonderful as the tomboyish George Sand (though slightly over the top at times) and gives the role quite a bit of depth and comedy.
I:297;369;Her performance alone makes this film worth watching.
I:297;370;all in all, a film worth watching, and, while it is not meticulously.
I:297;371;crafted, is still great fun for the performances and sheer comedic power.
I:297;372;This is will have you in stitches many times throughout.
I:297;373;Interesting and fun to see stars before they were big names.
I:297;374;thought it was well written and acted,would recommend it for a lazy afternoon.
I:297;375;George and her group of hedonistic friends are great fun to watch.
I:297;376;Wonderful performances by everyone, especially Emma Thompson and Mandy Patinkin.
I:297;377;"While taking some liberties with the real course of events, ""Impromptu"" does portray their relationship up to their departure for Majorca, as well as the story's backdrop in 19th century Paris and rural France, with an admirably light touch and in loving detail
I:297;378;"Judy Davis and a deliciously young and fragile Hugh Grant are the perfect embodiment of Sand and her ""Chopinet"" ."
I:297;379;You must win him as a man wins a woman.
I:297;380;"If anyone can do it, you can."""
I:297;381;"be lovers, Chopin and de Musset and Chopin and Marie
I:297;382;Chopin and Sand eventually become friends and .
I:297;383;They both will live forever in their works .
I:297;384;and this movie, which unfortunately went virtually undiscovered upon its 1991 release, is a wonderful, gentle reminder of the wealth of creativity and emotion they had to share.
I:297;385;not even a good romance story line to speak of.
I:297;386;I loved the period scenery and clothing, but it moved so slowly and seemed very shallow.
I:297;387;I have it on my i. pad and I expect I'll watch it again.
I:297;388;"I liked the story
I:297;389;i am extremely selective with romances and even more so with romantic comedies.
I:297;390;but the sensitivity that Grant brings to his films is evident especially in this one.
I:297;391;He is perfection as Chopin.
I:297;392;Judy Davis was very enjoyable.
I:297;393;Emma Thompson was a hilarious!
I:297;394;i felt the role was fun, yet challenging.
I:297;395;She was the perfect balance between annoying and endearing.
I:297;396;i just loved this movie.
I:297;397;but I feel imperfection is perfection.
I:297;398;This is a nicely done period movie depicting the life and loves of the controversial 19th century French writer George Sand.
I:297;399;As a writer Sand took on the flaws of society in her characters and scolded the public in her subtle but effective way.
I:297;400;As a woman Sand was far from beautiful but she had numerous affairs of the heart with many famous and powerful men.
I:297;401;She managed to thrill her lovers with her mind and her ever present need to be free from constraints, preferring to set her lovers free yet they always came running back for more or went crazy doing so.
I:297;402;Needless to say Sand is an extraordinarily interesting subject but to really know her one must read about her because she is far too limited by film.
I:297;403;this film is wonderful but incomplete.
I:297;404;Judy Davis plays the great George Sand about as perfectly as she can be played on film.
I:297;405;Davis takes on the famous characteristics of Sand, the tomboyish walk, her bold feministic approach and her enduring passion for life and love.
I:297;406;The film is actually quite entertaining although much of the history involved in these famous relationships is lost in the effort.
I:297;407;Hugh Grant is convincingly fragile and helpless as Chopin.
I:297;408;Bernadette Peters is great as the backstabbing and snide social climber, Marie D'Agoult.
I:297;409;Her work influenced many other authors and artists of the day.
I:297;410;I STRONGLY recommend Impromptu to anyone who wants to enjoy an evening of inspiration, history (as an entertaining mix of fact and fiction), romance, and comedy.
I:297;411;Judy Davis does an exquisite job of playing Sand as a confident, practical, strong woman who is also exquisitely sensitive, affectionate, and sometimes downright vulnerable.
I:297;412;It has inspired me to read as much of George Sand's work as I can, and to learn more about the life of this remarkable, passionate, courageous and talented woman!
I:297;413;Hugh Grant, the biggest star at the center of this film, is vulnerable and feminine, and the rest of the cast arranges itself around him.
I:297;414;"handed
I:297;415;I had seen this movie at the theater when it first came out and I enjoyed it very much.
I:297;416;This is an excellent film.
I:297;417;The acting is wonderful and the French countryside is beautiful.
I:297;418;This film will not appeal to everyone, but anyone who is interested in period films, life in the 19th century, Chopin, or George Sand will enjoy it.
I:297;419;It is very humorous, although in a sophisticated way.
I:297;420;To understand the film best it would help to have some knowledge of George Sand and her life and times, yet perhaps viewing the film would inspire people who do not know much about George Sand to learn more.
I:297;421;Judy Davis is fantastic as George Sand and Hugh Grant plays the shy Chopin perfectly.
I:297;422;Well done and the cinematography was well done.
I:297;423;I think it is a combination of romance and psychology.
