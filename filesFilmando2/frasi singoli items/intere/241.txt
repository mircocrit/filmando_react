I:310;1;Maybe they weren't, but that was the way that I understood it.
I:310;2;I think this was a perfect example of why.
I:310;3;If you are not going to use the modern computer animation, than at least make the voices somewhat spectacular.
I:310;4;They need a fresh edge, something for our new generation to enjoy.
I:310;5;I have seen nearly all of them, and still watch some of them today, but with these new releases it is becoming obvious that you have moved from children to greed.
I:310;6;The originality and honesty is gone.
I:310;7;Revamp and return, and I will give you a second chance.
I:310;8;And its final traditional release is going to be Home On The Range .
I:310;9;Home On The Range is a good movie.
I:310;10;It has some good jokes like those references to classic westerns like The Good, The Bad And The Ugly or John Huston's westerns.
I:310;11;hopefully, Disney is going to make some good CGI.
I:310;12;Totally goofy movie that is great for little kids.
I:310;13;Its a fun Movie, still after all these years you can pop this movie in and watch a rooting tooting fun movie for kids of all ages.
I:310;14;My groups enjoys the movie, watched it 3 times.
I:310;15;I was surprised and pleased with the music in this film.
I:310;16;"My 4 year old daughter and I are having a great time trying to yodel like Alameda Slim
I:310;17;The movie has all kinds of little tidbits for adults, and lots of hilarious action for the kids.
I:310;18;There are plenty of head bangs and punches in the movies, but they've managed to keep it somewhat PC.
I:310;19;The storyline is NOT the most amazing I've ever seen.
I:310;20;"Each little piece of the story is really great, though
I:310;21;"My daughter really likes the ""yodel."
I:310;22;The English subtitles are perfect, if you're into that kind of thing.
I:310;23;We both like to watch this movie in French, too.
I:310;24;The voices are dubbed wonderfully, and they've even translated the songs, and done them well!
I:310;25;, I DO like that it contained a lot of real insight into how the movie evolved.
I:310;26;i think that this is the first Disney animated movie for a long time that is a real pleasure to watch over and over.
I:310;27;"Your high expectations will never be met by new Disney movies
I:310;28;I love this movie my son and I watched this several times and he laughs at the funny parts an gets mad a out the mean ppl.
I:310;29;Once again we see how Pixar is grinding the life out of Disney.
I:310;30;I bought this for my son and he loves it.
I:310;31;The price was great and it is a very funny story with lots of famous voices
I:310;32;I love how Judi Dench's character was so much like her.
I:310;33;I don't know how much work it was to make a cow purse her lips and squinch up her face in disapproval, but it was a hoot.
I:310;34;If you are looking for good action and humor this is the movie for you.
I:310;35;It is a fun, beautiful story of a poor widow's struggle in the old West and the soundtrack is pitch.
I:310;36;Fun movie for little kids.
I:310;37;My daughter loves it and we can handle watching it with her (sometimes multiple times a week)
I:310;38;Oh, and they couldn't have found anyone better than Roseanne to do the voice for Maggie, she fit the part perfectly!
I:310;39;To abandon all that made the studio great and try to ape another's success is a sure sign of management's faithlessness in Disney's legacy.
I:310;40;My grandson absolutely loves this film.
I:310;41;Movie is creative, grandkids loved seeing the animals work together to solve the problem of saving the farm as the group learns to include the new.
I:310;42;of the many great animated Disney movies deserving of the blue ray treatment, this is by far one that should never be considered.
I:310;43;This is a very cute movie,my kids watch it a lot!
I:310;44;It is a great movie for all ages and every cowboy out there!!
I:310;45;My son loves this movie.
I:310;46;"He calls it ""the cow movie""."
I:310;47;I recommend it for the whole family.
I:310;48;My son has enjoyed this Disney movie a lot of times.
I:310;49;I truly enjoyed that it was something the whole family could enjoy, not just kids.
I:310;50;Yes, I laughed and had a ball, all by myself!!!
I:310;51;Madame Dench is adorable as the bossy cow.
I:310;52;We watched the movie together and it was entertaining for both of us to enjoy.
I:310;53;I would recommend this to any family with young children.
I:310;54;The film would also mark the final Disney film to be released on VHS.
I:310;55;The film is quite colorful and the backgrounds, structures are well.
I:310;56;Blacks are also nice and deep.
I:310;57;But for the most part, the lighting effects, the detail of the animation is well.
I:310;58;Audio is dialogue and music driven and while the film is center and front channel heavy, there is good use of the surround channels.
I:310;59;There are also moments of LFE but for this type of film, it is mostly dialogue and musical tracks front.
I:310;60;"sPECIAL FEATURES:""Home on the Range"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary ."
I:310;61;Anytime You Need a Friend Music Video .
I:310;62;trailblazers: The Making of Home on the Range .
I:310;63;"(16:40) A featurette of the production of ""Trailblazers"", the voice casting, the music, animation and more."
I:310;64;(10:15) Art director David Cutler and background supervisor Cristy Maltese talk about the film's environments and the overall art of the film and how they were inspired to create the artwork.
I:310;65;"jUDGMENT CALL:An enjoyable family film that children will love but those who grew up watching Disney films may be asking themselves after watching this film, ""where is the Disney magic?"""
I:310;66;"granted, at the time ""Home on the Range"" was considered the final Disney animated film to be done in a traditional way, there was a lot of buzz before and after the film was released."
I:310;67;Back then, I felt that both styles can still be done, attract a large audience and entertain people.
I:310;68;It's colorful, it's fun but I was expecting an exceptional Disney storyline.
I:310;69;But part of me, growing up with Disney films realize that these films are for a new generation of Disney fans.
I:310;70;For my young son, he enjoyed the comedy between the characters and it made him laugh.
I:310;71;And I realized, that as long as children are happy and that families can watch these films together with their children, that's all that matters.
I:310;72;ray release, the film does look great on Blu.
I:310;73;"personally, I felt ""Home on the Range"" was not so funny and even a bit light on the humor."
I:310;74;For Disney films, I suppose we have been spoiled so much by wonderful films that we expect great written storylines in each film.
I:310;75;"but I did enjoy the traditional artwork, some of the background images were beautiful to watch but ""Home on the Range"" was not as good as I hoped for it to be."
I:310;76;But once again, as long as the children are entertained, as a family film, it's good.
I:310;77;"but as a family film, I can recommend ""Home on the Range""."
I:310;78;This is a good film for children.
I:310;79;I would definitely recommend it to anyone with young children in the home.
I:310;80;Granddaughter liked this movie and it has brought her many laughs and giggles.
I:310;81;I have a four year old little girl that loves horses and a two year old boy who loves whatever his sister loves.
I:310;82;Disney Studios 45th full length animated feature film Home On The Range was Disney's last 2 D hand drawn animated film (at least until The Princess and the Frog came out).
I:310;83;i personally really liked Home On The Range and I think it is beautifully animated.
I:310;84;It's full of songs that reminded me of musicals like Oklahoma.
I:310;85;The voice work is also very good which each one fitting their characters.
I:310;86;this was a fun movie even for adults.
I:310;87;story line is geared for all ages.
I:310;88;recommend for any age that likes cartoons.
I:310;89;The kids love this movie!
I:310;90;In this movie the characters are fun, their interaction is fun, even the chase scene is fun.
I:310;91;The horse is great, with wonderful voice.
I:310;92;and that brings me to the cows.
I:310;93;The real deal with this film is that it stars women, and the characters are women, bovine women.
I:310;94;Each one is wonderful, and their interaction is hugely entertaining.
I:310;95;on top of that the music is really good, not something you cringe at, and think, oh well, that's Disney.
I:310;96;this is a movie that has scenes, and bits of dialogue that absolutely crack me up.
I:310;97;I love the movie more each time I watch it.
I:310;98;The story was old west and funny situations, Loved it and have watched it more than once.
I:310;99;This is an overlooked Disney gem at a great price.
I:310;100;Don't expect much and you'll be as pleased as I was.
I:310;101;So, it gets 4 stars from me.
I:310;102;You'd think a Disney movie should be safe to share with kids, but this movie has pretty much non.
I:310;103;"ray and ""Home on the Range"" is one of them."
I:310;104;Where's the fun in that?
I:310;105;One reason most animated Disney films gain popularity is because of their musical numbers.
I:310;106;"Think about all the movies like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Peter Pan,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and decades of others."
I:310;107;The only reason I even remember the villain's song is because he yodeled funny in it.
I:310;108;Academy Award winner Alan Menken dropped the ball on this one.
I:310;109;Viewers will be happy with the format upgrade to Blu.
I:310;110;i'll give credit to Disney for packing the release with enough special features to keep consumers happy.
I:310;111;This will please you if you're looking for the definitive high definition version of the film.
I:310;112;My kids and I loved it .
I:310;113;great songs and singers (includingBonnie Raitt), wonderful traditional animation (a great breakfrom computer.
I:310;114;paced, and a great(nearly) all.
I:310;115;woman cast (I usually don't like Roseanne Barr, butas the voice of the heroine cow she is terrific!)
I:310;116;Home on the Range is the last Disney traditionally animated film due to the increasing demand for computer animation.
I:310;117;This film has a lot of heart, and the story hits close to home.
I:310;118;Maggie(Roseanne Barr) is a prize winning show cow.
I:310;119;the style of animation is very good.
I:310;120;The scenery is so pretty, and the animals are so cute.
I:310;121;The voice work is amazing.
I:310;122;Dame Judy Dench provides the voice to lead cow on Patch of Heaven, Mrs. Calloway.
I:310;123;Jenifer Tilly is the voice of my favorite cow in the film, Grace.
I:310;124;She provides most of the comic releif during the film.
I:310;125;"He really is perfect at it, creating the second funnyist Disney villain, just next to Yzma from ""The Emporor's New Groove."""
I:310;126;Home on the Range is the type of Disney film that will please everybody.
I:310;127;It has a great story, as well as good humor, and a lot of heart.
I:310;128;I love this movie that I have watched when it was just released few years ago and now that I am a mother of 2 little girls who love animal farms, I knew they would love it and that was the case.
I:310;129;I was very happy for paying a small price for such great movie.
I:310;130;It was shipped to me within 3 days and the package was excellent.
I:310;131;This is another cute animal movie!
I:310;132;its in very good condition!
I:310;133;If you enjoy Roseanne, you will enjoy this film.
I:310;134;I like it and it's a keeper.
I:310;135;This movie is an OFFENSE to the wonderful Disney movies that were made up until Mulan.
I:310;136;There are so many other fairy tales Disney can breathe new life into.
I:310;137;Now because these movies bombed, Disney has decided that Home on the Range will be the last 2D animated feature.
I:310;138;Can you imagine how wonderful Rapunzel can be?
I:310;139;Very cute bought this movie for my son he watched it a few times we still watch from time to time.
I:310;140;I was raised on a Dairy farm so this is very cute,,,,My grandsons love this movie and the price was great!
I:310;141;The grandkids love this movie (over and over and over)Movie for kids but with enough humor that adults will enjoy it too.
I:310;142;who to this day, have had an unbroken string of films with strong, and usually gigantically successful openings.
I:310;143;"most of all, there some really fine songs, especially ""Little Patch of Heaven"" and the haunting ""Will the Sun Ever Shine Again"" (the latter been inspired in part, according to composer Alan Menken, by the despair following 911)."
I:310;144;watching and listening to the generous bonus features, it is evident that a great deal of skill and creativity goes into a film like this, so it cannot be dismissed as mere fluff, though it certainly does not leave you with the same glow as Beauty and the Beast.
I:310;145;received and exquisite Winnie the Pooh.
I:310;146;My kids love this movie!!
I:310;147;They get a good belly laugh while watching!
I:310;148;I recommend it to others, I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 10 1/2 year old and they both enjoyed it!
I:310;149;robbing, with new, excellent Disney theme music.
I:310;150;"The animation employs a lively mix of earthy tones, and ""Looney Tunes."
I:310;151;LITERALLY!First, let me say that Home on the Range, features an original musical score by Alan Menken, which is the best thing about the film.
I:310;152;The three cow's plan, is to find and capture Alameda Slim, and use the $750.
I:310;153;"dISNEY ""PIXAR"" FILMS SOON!It looks, all through the film, as if a better scene, and hopefully a better film, is just 'round the corner."
I:310;154;Home on the Range is a 2004 Disney animated feature film starring Roseanne Barr(Roseanne's Nuts!)
I:310;155;were living peacefully on a dairy farm when they learn that the farm is endangered of being forclosed and the money they need is the same amount of the reward for a crafty and ruthless yodeling cattle.
I:310;156;The music featuring k. d. lang, Tim McGraw, Bonnie Raitt and The Beu Sisters were wonderful to listen to and the comedy was a hoot.
I:310;157;The special features includes a behind.
I:310;158;Home on the Range may have gotten poorly bland reviews but I feel that this is one of Disney's rarest gems and a film worth seeing.
I:310;159;This is an excellent film for young and young at heart alike.
I:310;160;The animation was very good as was the score.
I:310;161;I understand that this may be the last animated Disney film to be drawn frame by frame by their talented artists.
I:310;162;I thought the animation in this film was truly nostalgic.
I:310;163;drawn full length animated feature by Disney than I will cherish this film.
I:310;164;Roseanne Barr is very engaging and likeable in the role and really steps out of herself.
I:310;165;Dame Judi Dench is masterful as usual, lending a fiery bravado to her role.
I:310;166;And the inimitable Jennifer Tilly as Grace the New Age Flake cow is hysterical, especially with the original use of tonedeafness and hypnotic yodeling as superpowers.
I:310;167;the soundtrack is upbeat, authentic and thoughtful .
I:310;168;The dialogue is intelligent and sparkles with with for virtually every character (excepting possibly the extraneous horse played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., who the movie could have easily done without).
I:310;169;"this movie may not be ""as good as"" the giants of the Disney studio, but it's a solid effort, a funny film, with really cute characters, bold animation, and a very heartwarming tale."
I:310;170;Very funny movie, great both for kids and adults, we were laughing through the whole movie.
I:310;171;I saw this movie with a lot of anticipation.
I:310;172;funny, and indeed felt like a really long Warner Brother's short, sans any humor.
I:310;173;"I gave it 3 stars because it was ""cute"" and a bit creative, and was overall an ok movie."
I:310;174;All in all, this movie just makes me more anxious for another superb Disney feature to come out.
I:310;175;I really hope the execs at Disney take the lack of success of this movie, as well as the lack of success of the vapid 'Treasure Planet' and realize that Disney fans are yearning for Disney's good ole' magical animation.
I:310;176;Many of the others are 'smart' cartoons that the whole family would enjoy.
I:310;177;People are looking for another Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan,and Little Mermaid.
I:310;178;I thought it was one of Disney's better animated films.
I:310;179;I also thought one of the best lines in the movie was Steve Busemi's line I gave up clown school for this?
I:310;180;This film, on the other hand, is a big step backward, and the hectic, pedestrian execution ultimately cripples it.
I:310;181;All it is is just another Disney flick that is just as charming and spirited as the older classics from Walt's period.
I:310;182;Enough to leave anyone with a smile.
I:310;183;so what if it's no Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, what matters to me is that I came out of the theatre feeling happy and loving the characters.
I:310;184;My favorite character was Grace.
I:310;185;for anyone who loves the original Disney formula, will truly enjoy this fun family film.
I:310;186;There were few laughs and no characters that touched my heart.
I:310;187;But my Grandkids LOVED it and my daughter says the songs are outstanding.
I:310;188;I give it a double thumbs up if you've got little ones.
I:310;189;Walt would be proud of this animated movie.
I:310;190;It is great fun for the entire family.
I:310;191;It reminded me of some of Disney's older movies and that's a good thing.
I:310;192;The music score is just great, one of the best in a while from the Disney animated films.
I:310;193;The choice of actors' voices was perfect.
I:310;194;I really had a good time at this one.
I:310;195;This movie is very cute with a great theme.
I:310;196;My children love to watch it and laugh at the cows singing and dancing.
I:310;197;Kids think its very funny.
I:310;198;I loved all of the characters in this movie.
I:310;199;An all around favorite of everyone I have spoken with.
I:310;200;One of the best Disney films to date.
I:310;201;I found this film to be very awesome and credit Disney for trying other things, and I like how they tried to make the film the same way as the animation was in the 40's.
I:310;202;Just so you know, it's my 6th favorite Disney film, and I'm proud to say that I loved it.
I:310;203;Disney should do more 2D films and hopefully as great as this film.
I:310;204;provided you found a way to make it fun.
I:310;205;"Aladdin and ""Hercules"" were not terribly original movies, but the execution for both of them were excellent, which is why those movies are still loved by many people of all age's years after they were finished."
I:310;206;Home on The Range is (as you've most likely heard) the final traditionally animated film from Disney, who gave us one of the greatest legacy's of all time.
I:310;207;There was some hope that the music for this movie would be excellent since Alan Menken (who's written some of Disney's best songs) was writing the music, yet even the music disappoints on many levels.
I:310;208;what's even more interesting is that all these story board scene's are voiced by the actual actors, and some of the scene's even have some completed animation.
I:310;209;I bought it for my daughter not long after it came out, and she has watched it a few times, but I never got around to viewing it.
I:310;210;"i really want to love ""Home On The Range"" because it has so much going for it."
I:310;211;It has some great voices in it thanks to the lovely Jennifer Tilly, Dame Judi Dench, Randy Quaid, and Cuba Gooding, Jr.
I:310;212;It had wonderful songs written by Alan Menken and performed by k. d. lang and Bonnie Raitt.
I:310;213;There was a neat little storyline and some wild West adventure.
I:310;214;"The animation was refreshingly ""biting""(if that's an accurate term)."
I:310;215;i really liked those parts of this film.
I:310;216;if you can look beyond those two glaring atrocities in this film, you'll probably enjoy it.
I:310;217;drawn animated feature from Walt's company, it will just have to suffice.
I:310;218;recommended to families with young children and those who really, really, REALLY love western adventure/comedy.
I:310;219;So glad we got it.
I:310;220;Good adult humor in it too.
I:310;221;There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video.
I:310;222;My little girl loves the cow movie as she calls it.
I:310;223;I watched it with the kids,and i love it.
I:310;224;the songs are too cute and original.
I:310;225;this move was shipped to me super fast and it is in great condition.
I:310;226;We all just love this movie!
I:310;227;We love it as much as the grandkids!
I:310;228;Just pull up a chair, add a bowl of popcorn and get ready for a great night together!
I:310;229;It was so easy and safe to order from them.
I:310;230;We love this fun, simple and stress free video.
I:310;231;We can watch it every day.
I:310;232;My grandchildren, ages 6 through 10, loved this movie.
I:310;233;The movie held all the children's interest, which is what we always appreciate.
I:310;234;A great movie for the entire family.
I:310;235;Voices as well as music and plot are well matched.
I:310;236;Critically applauded and commercially ignored, The Emperor's New Groove is one of Disney's best, and more importantly innovative, animated films (excluding Pixar releases).
I:310;237;Home on the Range is a return to Kuzco's standards with a design very reminisent of a 1950's Tex Avery cartoon and a sparklingly funny script.
I:310;238;right poor (Treasure Planet) Disney required a Lion King.
I:310;239;action films as with it's animated .
I:310;240;we live in hope that the studio that started and influenced them all can still compete .
I:310;241;As Pixar has shown, it's the script that must always come first (perfect animation is the icing on the cake) .
I:310;242;good moral fiber, and the bursting color is cool and the surround sound with K D Lang was perfect.
I:310;243;Nicely done with the animal.
I:310;244;My daughter and nice enjoy this movie very much.
I:310;245;I think it a very good movie.
I:310;246;They're not all masterpieces, but they all deliver good solid entertainment.
I:310;247;Technically, the film is well.
I:310;248;The animation is skillfully done.
I:310;249;To me, the best of Disney's pre.
I:310;250;HOME ON THE RANGE is nowhere near that dog story, but it is a diverting and entertaining film, with some of the best music in a recent Disney film, especially the lovely song sung by Bonnie Raitt.
I:310;251;"the voices do well: Roseanne Barr is an effective sleazy cow
I:310;252;I think the whole family will find something fun in this carefree little movie.
I:310;253;A cute story with tons of potential.
I:310;254;drawn Disney feature for the foreseeable future.
I:310;255;The songs are average as well.
I:310;256;in the end, kids will probably enjoy it, but it may wear on adults patience.
I:310;257;The best bet on this one would be to wait until it comes out on video.
I:310;258;It's the end the trail!
I:310;259;After nearly eighty years of loyal traditionally animated service, the Walt Disney Company has decided to call it quits, at least for the foreseeable future.
I:310;260;That's until new management came in, cleaned things up, and, with the help of Roy Disney, brought the animation unit back to its former glory with such hits as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.
I:310;261;But one has to wonder, with both traditional animation and Pixar out of the picture, what is Eisner thinking?
I:310;262;Maggie is one head strong woman.
I:310;263;And just when things begin to look on the way with Maggie finding a new happy home at Patch of Heaven dairy farm, the bank declares foreclosure on the farm, leaving the owner three days to pay off the $750 in order to keep the farm.
I:310;264;In the end, it's an all out of for truth, justice, and the bovine way!
I:310;265;science or anything like that but one can make the argument that this is a family film and if the adults don't get anything out of it, who's to say that this isn't anything more then a modest diversion.
I:310;266;what's becoming more of a rare oddity is the use of big name stars in animated features to drive movie.
I:310;267;d animation compete with the likes of Pixar with trap.
I:310;268;Who's the genius that thought that brilliant idea up?
I:310;269;All in all, Home on the Range marks the end of a roller coaster ride for traditional animation at Disney .
I:310;270;My four year old son loves this movie and wants to watch it four to five times a day.
I:310;271;It really keeps him entertained when I need to get work or household chores done.
I:310;272;Great music,wonderful scenery and lots of action and memorable charactetrs make for a wonderful film!This isn't some dull,boring,tossed.
I:310;273;Home on the range is a wonderful alternative to ho.
I:310;274;She thought the movie was hysterical and sat entranced the whole time.
I:310;275;There was a lot going on and the voices were very entertaining.
I:310;276;She even understood the emotions of the characters.
I:310;277;"The formatting of the movie goes back to the old ""Fox and the Hound"" days, but the color was very vibrant and the Old West scenes were pretty to look at."
I:310;278;I thought that the yodelling rustler was a riot and the idea of how he rustles was a brilliant one.
I:310;279;The Home on the Range movie was enjoyed by both of my grandchildren.
I:310;280;They really liked the animals in the movie
I:310;281;I love most of the animated features that have come out in recent years.
I:310;282;CGI has come along way, but this film uses hand drawn animation and it is also Disneys last hand drawn animated movie.
I:310;283;I thought the film was very entertaining with a very beautiful and vibrant color palette.
I:310;284;"Film was released in a slow period for regular Disney animation, between 1999's ""Tarzan"" and ""Tangled"" the only hit the NON Pixar films they had was 2002's ""Lilo and Stitch""."
I:310;285;Roseanne several years after her show went off the air is the main voice talent in this one.
I:310;286;This coming from Oscar winner Alan Menken.
I:310;287;"this movie that bombed at the box office and no one remembers has better extras than the August 2012 blu ray release of the 1995 Oscar winning Disney classic ""Pocahontas""."
I:310;288;This movie has upbeat animation and likeable characters.
I:310;289;like personalities, which is quite funny.
I:310;290;I wouldn't rate it up there with say, The Lion King, for example, but it might still entertain the kids nevertheless.
I:310;291;For animated kid/family friendly movies .
I:310;292;this one takes the cake!
I:310;293;Our whole family (all ages) loves it.
I:310;294;Great songs, hilarious characters, and best of all, sacrificial devotion to family and forgiveness make this one a 5 Star Movie (we'd even give it more stars if we could).
I:310;295;breaking like _Beauty and the Beast_, it is a fun, fast.
I:310;296;Plenty of action, beautifully rendered artwork (the scenic stuff is pure magic), and quirky characters (the three little pigs are especially fun .
I:310;297;Home on the RangeIt is a well done animated movie geared for children to enjoy, that is children of all ages.
I:310;298;over all it is a very enjoyable movie, and should be enjoyed by the entire family
I:310;299;will at first I didn't think that it was gone work but it has been working very good and I love it the kid's love it they think it's very funny to them think you so much !!!!
I:310;300;good movie perfect for young ages and all the kids at heart.
I:310;301;Even some of the music is great too.
I:310;302;I have treasured this movie for years and still enjoy it as a young adult!
I:310;303;"and even the new ones as: ""The Beauty and the Beast"", or ""The Lion King"" ."
I:310;304;Those movies left good songs and story memories in the mind of at least 4 generations.
I:310;305;Definitely not the newest and greatest animated feature but it is endurable and at times entertaining.
I:310;306;I personally really enjoyed the sound track and the colorful characters that are developed fairly deeply.
I:310;307;The subtle adult humor makes it more bearable for adults to endure.
I:310;308;handedly saved the company in the early 90's.
I:310;309;Home on the Range, while far from the delirious heights of the best Disney movies, is still a fast.
I:310;310;paced entertaining film with bright visuals and vivid characterizations.
I:310;311;Home on the Range may not make your spirit soar, but it provides some solid laughs and a very enjoyable outing at the movies.
I:310;312;All in all a great movie that they have watched several times over.
I:310;313;`Home on the Range', Disney's 44th and final hand.
I:310;314;drawn animated movie, is a surprisingly good one.
I:310;315;Just as all Disney animated movies are family.
I:310;316;fun oriented, `Home on the Range' succeeds in this manner, as it is a very casual movie filled with lovable characters.
I:310;317;Will they succeed in the end?Home on the Range may not be a classic compared to previous Disney masterpieces such as `Beauty and the Beast', `Aladdin', `Little Mermaid' or `The Lion King', but it has its own charm.
I:310;318;The score, composed by Alan Menken, goes exceptionally well with the theme of the movie.
I:310;319;crafted Disney movie, and should not be considered as being worthless.
I:310;320;`Home on the Range' is one of Disney's better efforts.
I:310;321;This is a good family movie.
I:310;322;We saw it at our school as a school movie and I think the kids really liked it (first and second graders the most).
I:310;323;My children love this movie!
I:310;324;The price for it was great.
I:310;325;When I first saw the trailer for this film, I wondered what in the world were the producers thinking!
I:310;326;"Then, I thought, maybe the same originality that yielded the really funny ""Emperor's New Groove"" would be found in this movie."
I:310;327;This people delivers the best service, they changed the movie without asking questios, if you want support they are 100% reliable.
I:310;328;This is one of my favorite movies (except for the lion king which is #1) this movie is for everyone out there.
I:310;329;It has a good message like the lion king and the story is amazing!
I:310;330;"My 2 year old watches this movie at least once a day
I:310;331;He is a toy story addict and to have a new movie he enjoys is a blessing.
I:310;332;It is very cute and I feel it's entertaining to have on in the background.
I:310;333;Granted it's no Lion King but if the children enjoy it than that's all that really matters.
I:310;334;I love this movie, and so do my children.
I:310;335;This movie is just a cute little film with good music, a fun story line, great animation (your kids will love the mine scene) and entertaining characters.
I:310;336;Oh, and a happy ending.
I:310;337;drawn animated films that helped make Disney an international trademark and a household name?
I:310;338;based work would have to be pretty darn impressive to win back an audience that has, in the last decade or so, grown accustomed to the sophisticated computer.
I:310;339;school and retro in its storyline and theme as it is in its style and form.
I:310;340;Compared to what modern youngsters are used to in the way of animation, the visual style here, though bright and colorful, is, at best, rudimentary and, at worst, primitive.
I:310;341;it's possible that someday traditional animation will mount a well.
I:310;342;They love music and dance and this was perfect.
I:310;343;I remember seeing this with my oldest son when he was young and now it's back around for my smallest.
I:310;344;Great movie that sometimes gets forgotten!
I:310;345;My kids *love* this movie!
I:310;346;wise, but it's been a favorite for years.
I:310;347;It incorporates A LOT of adult sexual humor.
I:310;348;There is also a lot of political and social issues brought up.
I:310;349;Very comical, fast service Great deal, very reliable.
I:310;350;Kids can watch this one over and over
I:310;351;It entertained my daughter and frankly that's all that matters to me.
I:310;352;I can hear them laughing as I type.
I:310;353;it has to be in the top ten all time favorites!!!
I:310;354;The music by Alan Menken is still great and the visual colorization is wonderful.
I:310;355;Not the best, but still good enough for the kiddies!!
I:310;356;It was worth the $5.
I:310;357;Mind you, she is 4 years old.
I:310;358;I bought it for her because she loves animals, especially farm animals, so I gave it a try.
I:310;359;This movie was never meant to be a classic Disney tear jerker, heart touching, bells and whistles film with your classic Disney characters with those big blue eyes and long flowy hair.
I:310;360;I thought it was hilarious.
I:310;361;The musical score was very good.
I:310;362;K. d. Lang has a beautiful voice people!
I:310;363;I've even bought her the plush dolls to play with and the Gameboy Advance game to play because she loves the characters in this movie (she loves Jeb the grouchy old goat for some reason).
I:310;364;The movie isn't brilliant but it's adorable, funny, and entertaining.
I:310;365;I think this movie is really cute and my son loves it it, he asks to watch the cows all the time.
I:310;366;This is a great movie!
I:310;367;He loves the cows and the cowboys.
I:310;368;nobody in my family liked it (from my 6 year old daughter to myself).
I:310;369;My gr kids love this story.
I:310;370;They were so happy to have a new one!
I:310;371;Delivery was quick and all was good, Thank you.
I:310;372;I have seen this movie when it first came out and loved it.
I:310;373;The film actually starts promisingly.
I:310;374;There are adventures, friendship, and several funny supporting characters, all voiced by capable cast including Roseanne (as Roseanne Barr who is just brilliant).
I:310;375;I thought the same thing while recently watching `Chicken Little,' but some animals cannot just look interesting or charming when translated into the world of animated films.
I:310;376;But the film has beautiful hand.
I:310;377;drawn images and good songs, and if the story fails to match them, that's the most likely explanation for that.
I:310;378;tthis movie is funny for kids and even most adults.
I:310;379;its a good movie with a fun plot.
I:310;380;"Home on the Range"" sees the closure of the traditional animation unit at Disney after a successful 44 film legacy that began with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""."
I:310;381;"A very funny comedy, ""Home on the Range"" tells the story of three cows, a karate kicking horse named Buck and others from the farm who try and prevent the foreclosure of their home the Patch of Heaven diary farm."
I:310;382;He uses his unique hypnotic yodeling to lure the cattle away from the farm in hopes of shipping them off to less green pastures.
I:310;383;"Featuring songs performed by The Beu Sisters, k. d. lang, Bonnie Riatt and Tim McGraw, ""Home on the Range"" is a marvelous and funny cartoon that the whole family can enjoy."
I:310;384;The breezy direction by Will Finn and John Sanford (who also wrote the script) along with a witty script make this last traditional animated feature a Disney classic from the get go.
I:310;385;a beautifully rendered transfer free of analog or digital blemishes, the 1.66:1 aspect ratio means that this film will look great on both traditional TV sets and widescreen models as well.
I:310;386;The sound doesn't have any hint of compression errors and comes across with tremendous presence and a nice spread in the surround speakers.
I:310;387;"We get a very funny animated short ""A Diary Tale: The Three Little Pigs"" which also played with the movie in theaters."
I:310;388;While some of the deleted scenes aren't quite finished, they're quite charming.
I:310;389;"There's a great little music video ""Anytime You Need a Friend"" incorporating some of the elements from the feature."
I:310;390;We also get a 16 minute documentary on the making of the film which provides lots of neat tidbits that even kids will enjoy.
I:310;391;rOM games we've seen introduced on movies for tweens and teens, their fun enough where most kids will enjoy them.
I:310;392;A funny and entertaining commentary track from the directors will keep animation buffs entertained.
I:310;393;There are moments here that will be over most kids heads though.
I:310;394;if this is, indeed, the last traditional animation feature we see from Disney (the company's Australian unit will continue to produce direct.
I:310;395;video and TV fare in the traditional hand drawn style), then it's a great farewell that matches some of the best Disney has produced over the years.
I:310;396;"It may not quite have the appeal of ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" but its atmosphere of Looney Tunes humor crossed with the more traditional witty Disney humor makes it a worthwhile movie to watch with the kids."
I:310;397;rOM features will provide a bit of entertainment independent of the feature film and the short cartoon and music video are also fun.
I:310;398;Disney's Home on the Range is laugh out loud fun for all.
I:310;399;Somehow, they know just the right voices for these characters.
I:310;400;Roseann Barr fits the main character cow perfectly!
I:310;401;I enjoy hearing the laughter of my children.
I:310;402;My husband and I laugh when we're driving at many of the lines that we hear when we can't even see the screen.
I:310;403;Very cute and funny movie with a good message.
I:310;404;This movie has great computer animation along with beautiful hand drawn animation.
I:310;405;Its a very funny movie in which you can sing along with.
I:310;406;I loved Jennifer Tilly as the voice of of the golden colored cow.
I:310;407;Everyone would love this movie.
I:310;408;Hope everyone adds this to their collection and enjoys it as much as i do!
