1;the story of the American Revolution in South Carolina told through various fictional amalgams of real personages along with real persons and events was a masterpiece when it was first released and time.
2;rather like GETTYSBURG inspired its own cast and behind the camera creative teams, so did this film.
3;and the film IS endlessly brilliant and inspired.
4;From Gibson's sublime performance as Benjamin Martin.
5;The film goes effortlessly from tremendous battle sequences to a tearjerking moment of a father having to leave his daughter to go off to war.
6;produced a fine score that can be listened on its own merits without visuals.
7;I love this film to death.
8;Somehow it snuck out of Hollywood when no one was looking and is one of the greatest films of the 21 st century as well as being that incredibly rare bird.
9;a rarer good film about the American Revolution and of the handfull of truly great films about the American Revolution.
10;one of the very few films made after 1980 that is as good as something made before 1965.
11;One of the very few films made after 1980 that I do not automatically have to treat like a special child since it is, after all, a modern film and it can't help itself.
12;a masterpiece of epic filmmaking.
13;A practical throwback to the 50s/60s era of the genre.
14;He just wants to live in peace and raise his family and tend his crops.
15;this is the true American spirit and even though Australian, Mel Gibson understands it very well.
16;Perhaps it is his faith that ties him together with us.
17;No wonder our brave countrymen fought the Revolution.
18;And watching this vivid and moving history you know God was on our side.
19;actually, the movie is pretty fascist in it's conception.
20;Plenty of extra features, great soundtrack and visuals.
21;This year i have seen many good movies, I really liked this movie though i wouldn't consider it as good as Mel Gibsons previous movie braveheart.
22;The Patriot does a masterful job of re.
23;As a college freshman and history lover, I watched this film because I had received good recommendations for it from like.
24;I believe the best way to teach history is through fiction (through books and movies), because it helps readers to see that history was a real event involving real people who experienced real tragedies and triumphs of life (just like we do now.
25;balance that impression with a much more realistic representation of the war.
26;I found this to be a great movie worth purchasing it's definitely going to be one of the classics worth holding on to!
27;The film gives an example of the fighting of that time.
28;Historians will object to some of the events created for dramatic effects.
29;But popular entertainment isn't academic history.
30;There is a final confrontation between Mel and the evil Colonel.
31;The War of Independence was won!
32;Mike Wright's What They Didn't Teach You About the American Revolution is a good place to start.
33;Mel Gibson plays Ben Martin, some one that is perfectly content with his life as it is and, will not fight in a war that will that not only destroy the lives of his countrymen, but could be witnessed by the eyes of his children.
34;After several viewings I see the strong likeness to Braveheart.
35;Braveheart struck a chord in me when I saw it, and goodness know's I was proud to have Scottish blood in me, and still am.
36;The Patriot should do something else, and that is: make us proud of our forefathers, and cheer for them.
37;The Patriot does give a hint, a glimps, into the way it was.
38;"It's about our freedom, and the high cost of it
I:48;39;Your not watching a documentary.your watching a movie and Hollywood makes movies to entertain you.
I:48;40;i love movies like The Patriot,Young Guns,Troy,300,and Black Hawk Down but none of them are histoically accurate but very entertaining.
I:48;41;it is a great entertaining movie
I:48;42;the battle scenes were well done .
I:48;43;and as for the portrayal of black american slaves as happy, smiling allies, puuuleeaaassee.
I:48;44;it was the brits who promised freedom to the slaves!like the brits rising to become the superpower of the nineteenth century, the story of america's rise from a colonial outpost of the british empire to the dominant power it is today should make for a great story .
I:48;45;The fictitious Benjamin Martin and his progeny are inflated with so much virtue, charisma and martial prowess that they overshadow the events surrounding them.
I:48;46;Hopefully, true patriots can still THINK.
I:48;47;Centered in the south and particularly South Carolina the scenery, the cast, the costumes .
I:48;48;everything is done very well to excellent.
I:48;49;This has become my favorite Mel Gibson flick and I watch it at least once a year and you should, too.
I:48;50;all the while this death and destruction on the battle field is going on and there this the most uplifting and 'patriotic' music blaring.
I:48;51;numbingly wholesome and unrealistic that i almost gagged.
I:48;52;It is not a history lesson"
53;There were other people in the movie who also played their roles superbly.
54;It is a brutally real story of war in people's own backyards and towns, and focuses on one man's struggle to protect his family from the horrors of the war around them.
55;Overall I thought this was an excellent movie with one exception .
56;Highly recommended for adults, but may be too bloody for kids.
57;Yes, there are shocking scenes worthy of good action adventures, but when the film depicts the burning of a church full of innocents, which never happened, the viewer must realize he has been had.
58;And I'm certain Emmerich has earned it by now.
59;Richardson and most of the cast are fine.
60;The cinematography is almost magical, capturing the time, place, and feel of 1776 Charleston.
61;Yes, there are shocking scenes worthy of good action adventures, but when the film depicts the burning of a church full of innocents, which never happened, the viewer must realize he has been had.
62;And I'm certain Emmerich has earned it by now.
63;Richardson and most of the cast are fine.
64;The cinematography is almost magical, capturing the time, place, and feel of 1776 Charleston.
65;The scenery is lovely, the cinematography very good.
66;Outstanding movie on all levels and Gibson is great as the hero.
67;Plays it superbly throughout and has us rooting for him to obtain full retribution for the deaths of his sons
68;As usual a romantic line to the story is involved with Gibson's character's sister in law played by the beautiful Jolie Richardson.
69;with constant setbacks that leaves you thinking if the Good will triumph over Evil, all soon comes to a head in one final epic battle and it's bloody conclusion.
70;for Gibson fans and all, a worthy addition to your library.
71;i remember instantly liking the new young actor Heath Ledger who played his son.
72;We don't get many movies about the Revolutionary war and I enjoyed this one.
73;The final battle scene was very good.
74;Tendentious films that rewrite history and in which he is always the hero.
75;is the truth a surprise to any of you Mel lovers?
76;But enough of Braveheart, let's talk Patriot, the movie is great, the soundtrack is very nice, it was nominated for an Oscar, which proves my point.
77;The acting is quite good, Heath Ledger really surprised me, and after seeing A Knight's Tale, a movie he made after The Patriot, it confirmed me that he is a very good new.
78;comer actor, he really helps the Patriot.
79;This is a good film, take my word.
80;It's interesting to look at what sells in movies.
81;But the American Revolution, the war that created the United States.
82;what great movies have been made about that?
83;Then there's murders, raids, massacares, betrayals, laughs, ruthlessness, revenge, and a love intrest between Mel and his sister.
84;"The scenes are often colorful in an unrealistic fashion
I:48;85;But as it stands, if you want a good movie in the age of old style cannon, you've got Gettysburg, Glory, or the Last of the Mohicans as good picks"
86;The movie came really fast and it looks like normal wear and tear.
87;it's the most wonderful movie ever !
88;both the picture and sound are EXCELLENThighly recommanded
89;I'm 13 and I've seen this movie 4 times and each time I saw it I loved it!
90;I definately recommend this movie to people who like action and are willing to put their pride away and let their emotions run wild, believe me I did!
91;The Patriot is a really good movie.
92;It's very well done, and the story is great.
93;The cast is fantastic as well.
94;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are awesome working together.
95;The period in time is truly fascinating to me, and should be of some interest to every American who wonders about their country's past.
96;The way this film intwines the war for freedom with personal stuggles that had nothing to do with war is excellent.
97;The war scenes are captivating.
98;It's just an excellently well done movie.
99;It was a good movie but a bit long.
100;I always enjoy the costumes for the period as well as the special effects in the battle scenes.
101;We watched this movie several times several years ago and we loved it.
102;I think it's one of the best Civil War that I have ever seen.
103;The grit that it took for Martin to loose 2 sons to a war that was worth fighting made my heart sad and happy at the same time.
104;To think that a group of Farmers with pitch forks held off part of the British army to eventually beat theEnglish and win us our freedom makes me proud of them, this country and the guts,courage and determination of all of our service people.
105;I would recommend this movie to anybody at anytime.
106;As a dad trying to raise two boys into wise, strong men, I found this move just right.
107;When they're old enough, it'll be one we watch together.
108;But there are times when the cause is right and just, and war must be waged.
109;A good fictional story to add to their curriculum of real.
110;Well the original of course, but was seriously happy when they came out with the extended edition.
111;Great acting, filming, directing and music.
112;My grand children will see this in about 15 years, and under stand what our for.
113;Being a huge fan of the revolutionary era, I love this movie (and not for its historical (in)accuracies).
114;I have done my geneology and have details on their lives and families as well as their service.
115;I take this film personally and trust me, I have to keep tissues at arm's reach.
116;mel did a great job and the countryside settings are breathtaking.
117;There are heartwrenching scenes as well as scenes of cruelty and sorrow.
118;We traditionally show this every Fourth of July (my family will remember that the day is not just for picnics and fireworks)and the movie is really enjoyed by all!
119;I enjoy watching Gibson kill and smash the bad guys so I enjoyed this film.
120;And I know that Gibson is capable of delivering it.
121;It is entertaining so I give it a recommendation to those that like adventure and action.
122;Not to those looking for a really good period story.
123;You can just imagine how true this movie could of been with so many people.
124;Happy, Sad, and Inspiration all wrapped up into this one.
125;A movie you can watch more then a few times.
126;This was a great movie regarding history for sure.
127;First off I will have to admit, I liked this movie.
128;here are some of the good.
129;the action sequences and cinematography are amazing.
130;This director really knew how to set up the battle sequences so that they are both picturesque, and frightening at the same time.
131;Cavalry charges were still used to a great degree of effectiveness, and they used them with deadly efficiency.
132;there were some funny moments with Mel Gibson and his children.
133;some of the dialogue is interesting and the character motivations were not all standard.
134;Cornwallis was a noted field commander and a favorite of the king.
135;the antagonists, though well acted and interesting, were over the top in some key areas.
136;It will entertain most and just about everybody will find something they like in it.
137;the costumes, production and supporting cast of this movie were A#1!
138;I also loved the portrayal of Lord Charles Cornwallis by Tom Wilkinson, a phenomenal British actor.
139;Rene Auberjonois, fresh off his role from DS9 was a delight to see.
140;I was pleased to see him in a motion picture.
141;He more than held his own as a preacher.
142;Mel Gibson has to be one of my favorite actors.
143;His ability goes beyond his good looks and the big action usually associated with his movies.
144;The action that followed was one of the most intense scenes that I had ever witnessed, outside of the first battle scene in Braveheart.
145;"Maybe Mel was turned off by his Braveheart demise and in this movie went for the exact opposite, or maybe he thought a movie about the revolutionary war should end on a good note
I:48;146;I remember when I first saw this film, about two days after my wedding.
I:48;147;There are a lot of films that circulate this genre, and you really have to stand up tall to be taken seriously.
I:48;148;this is sad, because the performances here are all very, very good, at times broaching on fantastic.
I:48;149;He found the grit within the script and used it to bring this character to life before our eyes.
I:48;150;Heath Ledger (R. i. p.) is also wonderfully used here.
I:48;151;He had just started building his career in 2000 and this is one of those performances that makes you stand back and take notice.
I:48;152;Tom Wilkinson is always great (I love that man) and even though he doesn't have a huge role, his scenes are brilliantly executed.
I:48;153;the films direction is effective, and the battle scenes (while nothing overly impressive) are very well crafted.
I:48;154;The savagery of certain scenes (like the aforementioned hacking) is also used in an effective and memorable fashion, and the cinematography adds layers of beauty to the films gritty core.
I:48;155;This movie is very long and i didn't really enjoy it.
I:48;156;Had a more thoughtful director gotten hold of the story elements, cast, crew, and cinematographer, a masterpiece may well have emerged.
I:48;157;Our national icons are fairly important, but the ideas they represent and allude to are by far more inspiring and subtle than mere flag.
I:48;158;I thought this movie was somewhat simplistic but entertaining.
I:48;159;If you don't mind some facts being wrong, this movie is an entertaining popcorn epic.
I:48;160;First off, this is certainly a historically inaccurate movie on the American Revolution"
161;Rather, it is a universal story about a people (and a family) struggling for peace and freedom.
162;mel Gibson does a masterful job as peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin, who finds he and his family are caught in the middle of a war against Britain's monarchy.
163;"He is not the perfect hero that Maximus is in the film ""Gladiator,"" the ""other"" big epic of that year."
164;"A word on Tavington: He's probably one of the best villains in modern movie history, and ranks right up there with Commodus in the movie ""Gladiator."""
165;"Wilkinson as Cornwallis is perfect
I:48;166;figure for Colonel Tavington is a nice touch.
I:48;167;Their exchanges are some of the most interesting in the movie.
I:48;168;Heath Ledger is also good as the eldest son of Martin.
I:48;169;the battles are quite good, though by no means perfect.
I:48;170;There is alittle bit of everything in it .
I:48;171;and it keeps you interested the whole time.
I:48;172;He's beautiful to look at .
I:48;173;but he showed such promise.you just knew he was destined for greatness.
I:48;174;and would recommend it to anyone.
I:48;175;As you can tell by my stilted language, it has had a profound effect on me.
I:48;176;It is one of the most heart warming movies I have ever seen!
I:48;177;Cant wait to watch it again love it.
I:48;178;The Patriot made me laugh and cry.
I:48;179;It made me angry and happy all at the same time.
I:48;180;Heath Ledgar played the part of Gabriel perfect.
I:48;181;He looked and acted very much the part of a son who was going to do what he thought was right.
I:48;182;This was the best movie I've seen in a while.
I:48;183;It's a must see for every American.
I:48;184;But go see the movie!
I:48;185;I must say this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.
I:48;186;i enjoyed the whole movie.
I:48;187;It made me laugh, and it made me cry.
I:48;188;it is a great educational video with a great cast with Mel Gibson and Heath ledger.
I:48;189;I loved it and i wish for all of you to see it!
I:48;190;There are the set pieces of Lexington, Concord, Paul Revere's ride, Valley Forge and so on.
I:48;191;colonists remaining loyal to the British crown were numerous and many formed up military units.
I:48;192;The Patriot is a fictionalized account of events that occurred during this period.
I:48;193;the battle scenes, particulary Cowpens, accurately depict 18th century rules of engagement, and the costumes are authentic, right down to the buttons.
I:48;194;The role of the French, whose alliance was crucial to winning the war is well represented.
I:48;195;Mel Gibson is impossibly clever, noble and brave, and the fact of slavery is sanitized to the point of absurdity.
I:48;196;Still, this movie does shed light on a unique time in American history, and is certainly worth seeing.
I:48;197;Great story, great timely service in getting the product.
I:48;198;The outcome was well worth all the time and effort that was put into it.
I:48;199;It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry, and every emotion in between.
I:48;200;It's a FICTIONAL portrayal of the screenwriter's imagination.
I:48;201;it's a unique combination of gory violence, touching family situations, the private anguish of a guilt.
I:48;202;ridden mind and the shared, often.
I:48;203;The devastating effects of war upon a civilian population is also integral to the story.
I:48;204;at story's beginning, Martin is an advocate for peace because he knows the real consequences of war.
I:48;205;sweeping in scope yet always maintaining a most human perspective, skillfully balancing action, romance, pathos and humor, """"The Patriot"""" addresses the quandary of what must be done when one's convictions are directly challenged by opposing and overwhelming events."""
206;This is truly one of the best films set during the American Revolution.
207;At the end of the day, despite the historical inaccuracies, the complex storyline, and character developments, the film is a refreshing and new look at America's fights against Nazi Germany and their British Allies during the American Revolution.
208;Other than that, this movie is awesome!This movie made me proud to be an American and reminded me of the price that was paid for our freedom.
209;The characters were great, the scenery was great, the plot was great.
210;the moral of this story is that war should only be the absolutely last resort.
211;as a veteran, it was amazing to see the reluctance of this veteran to enter a war.
212;You can feel the emotional toll on Mel Gibson each step of the way.
213;If it gives me warm, fuzzy feelings, and shows me that people still have the passion to fight for their country and loved ones, then I can relate.
214;Plus Mel Gibson always gives it his all and is far from a stagnant character actor.
215;It was a great move!!!
216;They did a great job with the setting and acting!!
217;I would absolutely recommend this movie (:
218;Excellent movie, with some historical facts and hollywood hype added.
219;Gun control advocates should see this movie for a lesson on the 2nd Amendment to the U. s. Constitution and why the right to bear arms is of a great benefit to this country.
220;All Americans should see this movie for a history refresher as to how this country became the great nation it is today.
221;Good action and acting, see the movie.
222;This movie is excellent on it's own.
223;The sets and costumes are perfect and the characters are rich and varied.
224;I especially enjoyed Heath Ledger as Mel Gibson's eldest son.
225;It has fun for the whole family!
226;Instead of fighting for his wife he's fighting for his children.
227;And once again he's fighting the British.
228;After a few shots they charge at one another.
229;A great epic lengnth movie which you'll want to see again and again.
230;The action scenes were impressive of course, and Mel Gibson does seem to be one of the best in the business at bringing an authentic feel of rage and passion into the roles he plays in action movies.
231;flick (a. k. a. unrealistic wartime romance and family junk) subplots designed to widen its appeal, I liked this movie quite a bit.
232;Partially because it is rousing, but also because I admire the masterful emotional manipulation and the skillful propaganda technique.
233;They'll never take our freedom.
234;Screen writers should really give viewers more credit for intelligence.
235;hur, and Edward Zwick's Legends of the Fall and Glory.
236;I laughed literally when they burned down the church.
237;I liked the movie even though there was a lot of bloody and nerve on edge scenes.
238;The acting superior and setting were good.
239;It's got lots of action and drama, and a little bit of romance.
240;It was a great history movie.
241;There is a LOT of blood and gore, but the overriding themes of love of family, courage in the face of crisis, and seeking after God in the midst of trials were enough to make this one of my all.
242;Can't a movie just be exciting, fun and entertaining without have a dozen layers to put viewers to sleep?
243;waver, but that's what was so fun about it.
244;Just watch it and allow the action to take you, forget about the details.
245;I think the acting was good, and the battle scenes chillingly realistic.
246;actor and you will do okay.
247;It added action thriller, good guy/bad guy matinee qualities at moments where simple adherence to historical detail could have created and displayed the wickedness of the war without using Steven Seagal villain archetypes to emphasize those facts.
248;It actually distracted me from the historical content I was most interesting in seeing this movie for in the first place.
249;I really loved the way they looked out on their front yard through the big picture window chatting quietly while watching the battle take place like they were watching a Holyfield boxing match on a big screen.
250;I give it 2 stars because it does have its moment, though too few and far between.
251;They are lasting, powerful movies filled with both disturbing imagery and beautiful landscapes.
252;this movie is more action/drama than documentary, but that's how it was advertised and it lives up to it.
253;his way to freedom,beyond the vomiting dark,beyond the stomach wallsof the shark.
254;This movie was slow to start and then very long, but worth it.
255;this movie was slow to start and then very long, but worth it.
256;This movie takes you through many edge.
257;of.your seat scenes, so be prepared.
258;The film has good cinematography, acting, music by John Williams .
259;This is especially important when so many people get most of their knowledge of history from TV and movies.
260;In this movie, Mad Mel finally gets to have his revenge.
261;Plus it has some gorgeous cinematography and suitably spectacular battle scenes.
262;If you are looking for a mindless action movie with good production values, this is a movie worth seeing.
263;positive points: The costumes were fantastic and who ever styled this film did their homework.
264;The only reason I went to see The Patriot is because, when I found out that Roland Emmerich directed it, I gazed upon the film's poster with a sense of humorous irony tickling my funny bone: The guys who made Independence Day are making a movie about Independence Day.
265;I sat down, watched the previews and laughed hysterically at the movie theater's ridiculous promotion music, then I proceeded to kick back and enjoy a terrific movie going experience.
266;The Patriot is, like Saving Private Ryan, very realistic in its depiction of war, very lushly photographed, and very well acted.
267;Mel Gibson, as always, is charismatic and heroic in the lead role.
268;As the film opens, we see life on a farm in one of the southern colonies.
269;He is still reverred as one of the great heroes of a battle that he won almost single.
270;The man knows how to fight, but when it comes to fighting for a cause that is, he agrees, great, but also suicide, and taking care of his family, he chooses family.
271;Robert Rodat, who wrote Saving Private Ryan, also wrote The Patriot, and he does a job that is on a par with his previous work, but he ends up surpassing himself with the addition of a splendid villain, played by Jason Issacs, who is a renegade Colonel of the Redcoat army.
272;up: Jason Issacs versus Joaquin Phoenix) I loved this movie through and through.
273;Besides, the payoff at the end is way to good to cast this movie aside.
274;The characters are interesting, the supporting cast is great, the battle sequences are expertly executed, and visuals are stunning.
275;Bottom line: The Patriot delivers.
276;The high ranking this film receives illustrates what a potent force Hollywood can be and gives the lie to claims that people don't accept these kinds of films as factual.
277;Sure, many viewers enjoyed it simply for what it claimed to be .
278;Now, after watching it about ten times, I have to say this is a wonderful film.
279;The Patriot was a great film, and now it can be seen in all it's glory with this new double disc edition.
280;It features a Behind the Scenes featurette, the True Patriots feature, and some outstanding deleted scenes including a funeral for Mel's son who is murdered by a brutal British officer in the beginning of the film.
281;in summary, an outstanding film, a great DTS 5.1 soundtrack, and a disc full of bonus features!
282;Even though it is strictly a formula plot, Mel Gibson and an excellent cast pull it off.
283;Heath Ledger is excellent as the son who must fight despite his father's warning, and Jason Isaacs is wonderfully mean as the brutal British officer.
284;This story is akin to Braveheart in that it stars Mel Gibson in another epic movie, and that they go whomp the English.
285;Also like Braveheart, that acting is quite good, the visuals are amazing, and, of course, all of the nit pickers out there found something wrong with it.
286;(which is one of the cheapest new.
287;The Patriot is Mel Gibson's stab at making another epic historical picture.
288;the battle scenes are really incredible.
289;The Patriot is also beautifully shot in fine epic style.
290;I thought if you are going to make a historical picture then yes, you can take some dramatic license with your material.
291;well, you get the point.
292;no, TERRIFYING difference is that this movie is meant to be taken seriously as everything that is good, true and real about what America is.
293;And what a lucky coincidence that, in the midst of a gigantic slave.
294;"whipping machine, we find one cute little farm, with an incredibly good looking ""Hero of the Black Slaves""."
295;"Benjamin Martin is their best definition of what a patriotic American is?So many reviewers have written ""This is just entertainment!"
296;A movie about the very creation of the country I take such fierce pride in doesn't need to be historically accurate and truthful to show America at its best, does it?I will close by saying that anyone in America or the world who take pride in this movie need to think these questions over.
297;worthy performances with the Upmost of ease.
298;He is Wonderful in his role, Every time he is on screen, he just Grabs my attention, even away from Mel.
299;roland Emmerich proves himself a Serious Director after a career of Sci.
300;He Directs the film with the Passion of a Patriot, even though he was not born in America (much like Wolfgang Peterson, director of such American Flag.
301;"The Patriot makes a Great Companion piece to ""Braveheart"" and a Perfect Addition to the Collection of All Fans of War Films."
302;It is about time that Hollywood came out with a definitive Revolutionary War film such as this fine masterpiece.
303;I hope there will be more!
304;This is one that is made for the big screen.
305;pan and scan will ruin such an epic.
306;Battle scenes are some of the best since PVT. Ryan.
307;You'll cheer for the heroes and cheer when the villain gets his due.
308;This is a very entertaining film with well.
309;If you want good escapist fun, check this out.
310;Love this movie, could watch it over and over.
311;In the years between Braveheart and The Passion Of The Christ, Mel Gibson created The Patriot .
312;a big screen portrayal of the American Revolution against the British crown.
313;Nominated for three Academy Awards, and including a brilliant original soundtrack composed by John Williams, The Patriot is an excellent illustration of the historical roots of American representative government.
314;Mel Gibson stars in the lead role with his usual charismatic screen presence.
315;A veteran of the French and Indian War, Martin is well aware of the horrors associated with armed conflict.
316;He prefers the safety and tranquility of farm life and encourages his family to do the same.
317;Hunting down British army officers with the stealth actions of a wild animal, Martin employs guerilla tactics and superior knowledge of the land in order to level the playing field against the world's greatest army.
318;released in late June of 2000, just a few days before Independence Day, The Patriot is a well.
319;written, action packed foray into the world of Colonial rebellion.
320;Its stunning portrayal of the American Revolution inspires every viewer who retains a modicum of patriotism for the American experiment, and the fight for freedom makes for a worthy subject.
321;One of Mel Gibson's best movies, The Patriot offers scene after scene of majestic landscapes, elegant soundtrack music, and an overall story dripping with action and suspense.
322;If you loved Braveheart, then you'll definitely enjoy The Patriot.
323;Its similar depiction of an honorable and heroic figure fighting for the freedom of his countrymen makes The Patriot a must.
324;see film for the ages.
325;wringing bleeding heart types that don't understand the second amendment and enjoy a film that has great action, good acting and excellant cinematography.
326;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are excellant as Father Son going up against the Redcoats, and the supporting cast are all great.
327;Again we are hit with a movie that makes a convenient slant on history.
328;this makes a potentially fantastic movie leaving you somewhat dissapointed when there was no need for it.
329;good actingGreat storyGood directingIdiot historian.
330;This movie will make all Americans, Proud Americans.
331;Glory, pride and an easy win, Typical!
332;But Mel Gibson did a fine job in this movie.
333;Unlike a lot of critics, I really enjoyed this movie.
334;i enjoy watching historical fiction because it is a trip down a history lesson.
335;And for the women, there are plenty of love scenes too, so keep a hankie close by!I rate it 4 stars and just watching Mel Gibson up there is worth it.
336;Firstly it glorifies the Americans and regards all the British as cold blooded killers and of course the lead role, played by Mel Gibson is a hero.
337;Also he regularly went out with his other 'heroic' neighbours for a spot of casual Indian hunting.
338;This film is easily as anglophobic as Braveheart and just about as historically accurate.
339;But then again this is Mel Gibson at his best!!
340;for the love of God, people, think about what you're watching!
341;I missed the chance to see this movie on the theatre mainly because I thought it was another Godzilla, but having Gibson as the lead.
342;hand combat scenes, a thrilling soundtrack and a first.
343;Teaching how the war really was is easily done with this film.
344;Thanks for bringing the past history to light.
345;I remember a sentence from a U. s. movie specialist on CNN who said after Independence day: Great!
346;well, that's the story of EVERY war in known history .
347;having seen, enjoyed and loved this movie from the first to the last second, personally I am wondering about what went wrong that the good relationship between the Americans and the French had suffered that much during the last 224 years.
348;reviewing the entire movie .
349;but that's a personal one.
350;I think that this movie is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.
351;Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance!
352;The movie was long, but it went by so fast because every moment was packed with suspense, humor, plenty of sad moments, and moments that just want to make you shout out in fear.
353;Also, Heath Ledger gave a great performance too.
354;I recomend this movie to ANYONE who has a good taste in movies.
355;And made the person happy.
356;Ok lets go burn some women and children.
357;Let's make the villain as ridiculously inhuman as possible, as if this is a fun James Bond movie.
358;good points: Gibson was good and the cinematography was beautiful.
359;No it wasn't perfect but it kept me on the edge of my seat and held my interest.
360;The passion and emotions of a father and his children, the value of friends and family in times of upheaval, the measure of commitment to freedom of our forefathers, it is all in here.
361;This film gives the viewer some tiny indication of what it might be like to wage war in your own country against a foreign power far superior.
362;It is a Thanksgiving classic in our home.
363;the picture and sound is woooooooooow.
364;an disc to let see the true potentieel off blue ray
365;The Patriot is an immensely entertaining, action packed film with some of the best battlefield and hand.
366;hand combat scenes in modern cinema.
367;"I don't mind that a whole lot of rhetoric floats around about ""the cause"" and ""the country"" and any other allusions to the magnificent nation to come when in fact the primary cause of the Revolution was the desire to eliminate excessive British taxation."
368;"Having enjoyed Mel Gibson's visceral tomahawk handling, our kids will go home and think that slavery played no part in the building of this country because the black guy in the movie got to fight alongside the white guys ""for the cause""."
369;Cardboard characterizations and a formulaic script overwhelm the excellent cinematography and glimmers of good acting.
370;In warfare one wants the HIGH ground!
371;the battle scenes were fantastic though.
372;A lot of care and detail went into making the scenery look realistic.
373;The wardrobe seemed to have a nice authentic feel to it as well.
374;I enjoy this film each and every time I stick it into the player.
375;The actual filmmaking is beautiful.
376;The special effects are good.
377;The soundtrack is patriotic and stirring.
378;"as an American whose proud to be an American, I love ""The Patriot."""
379;I enjoyed his contributions greatly to the disk.
380;They did a great job transferring this to Blu.
381;It was dazzling in detail.
382;I really liked this movie, which overruns Mission: Impossible II and X. men by a million.
383;If you liked Braveheart, but would rather a milder film, I highly recommend The Patriot.
384;By now, most people have seen this outstanding film.
385;It's a true pleasure to watch.
386;fun, exciting, no real substance other than the thin story line that barely holds it together.
387;This film goes much deeper and tells the story of a reluctant hero and his family.
388;One minute all is well on the farm.
389;Our hero (Mel Gibson) has put his time in for God and Country in past battles and now just wants to be a craftsman making a living and bringing up his kids the best way he can.
390;stories to the main tale, and these stories are touching and target the softer personalities, but that just makes the movie all the more well rounded and worth owning.
391;It's not a true drama , it has several humorous moments, it's entertaining, it puts some of the Revolutionary War era into perspective, and brings the reality of battle on our home soil right to your own back yard.
392;A beautifully photographed and well written historical drama based loosely on the revolutionary war hero THE GRAY GHOST.
393;Mel Gibson shows why he is one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood today.
394;Displaying a range of emotions from comedy to tear invoking drama this movie will take you up and down the scale of human emotion.
395;It is a great story and the acting is top notch.
396;Truly an outstanding performance by Mel Gibson!
397;good movie with a roller coaster emotion ride.
398;Gibson makes you feel his character and the location and scenery add to this spectacle.
399;Simply on the basis of its story, The Patriot is as good a movie as I've seen in years.
400;Mel Gibson is a great storyteller, maybe the best in Hollywood.
401;As in Braveheart, Gibson knows just what emotional buttons to push to draw you in and hold you fast.
402;And one of my definitions of a great movie is a movie that seems shorter than it is.
403;All in all, a great movie.
404;With the American Revolution, it is another matter.
405;In America, the history is fairly well.
406;if you can overlook the historical lapses, The Patriot is a great piece of storytelling.
407;"Truly great people sacrificed all to lay the foundation of our truly great country
I:48;408;War is not the first option but preserving family and freedom make it worth the extreme cost.
I:48;409;americans may dislike this film (big surprise).
I:48;410;But the acting is somewhere between good and fantastic.
I:48;411;The costumes and locations were remarkable.
I:48;412;The cinematography and special effects were impressive.
I:48;413;It has totally distorted the image of the American Revolution and what makes it such an important era in American history.
I:48;414;As an American you root for the colonials, but the whole jingoistic feel to the movie keeps you from really caring.
I:48;415;Better to watch Saving Private Ryan or Braveheart for great, savage battle scenes and greater character depth.
I:48;416;Welcome to the world of the modern epic.
I:48;417;a world where history itself will be distorted to fit into a demographically audience tested action film formula while many of it's tiniest details are meticulously made as accurate as possible.
I:48;418;It's not a documentary after all, it's a summer blockbuster from the genius' who brought us Independence Day, Godzilla, and 13th Floor.
I:48;419;Mel Gibson will give us a really good performance, we'll have a romance or two, and then we'll make sure it's good and bloody too.
I:48;420;Hard to believe that a film made today can be cornier, and sillier than films made 50 and 60 years ago.
I:48;421;And there's a lot of period detail accurately on display in this film.
I:48;422;Accurate historical detail is another matter all together.
I:48;423;But the inspiration for the character was a slave.
I:48;424;if you're looking for a big, sprawling, overly patriotic bit of inaccurate goo, this film will fit the bill nicely.
I:48;425;He makes a good Snidely Whiplash of a villain.
I:48;426;Sometimes director , producer and actor commentaries can be quite interesting either from a technical film.
I:48;427;making perspective or from a colorful behind the scenes story perspective.
I:48;428;Sometimes the commentaries are very funny, sometimes they are very insightful and downright educational.
I:48;429;maybe the logo is the best part of the film.
I:48;430;accurate look at possibly the most important events in American history better look elsewhere.
I:48;431;The film starts with talk of the pending revolution and Martin's objection to it on moral grounds and not because of loyalty to the crown.
I:48;432;Keeping that in mind, """"The Patriot"""" is a worthy project, and it serves to further bolster Mel Gibson as a talented actor and craftsman of tremendous range."""
433;the historical mutilations are numerous and have been well explored.
434;loving stars and stripes wielded by a slaveocracy.
435;Americans may have fought in the name of freedom, and certainly George Washington and many others were noble souls and worthy of remembrance.
436;In the name of freedom those who exercised their right of conscience and decided not to seperate from the mother country were persecuted and driven from their homes.
437;the revolution is ambiguous and all the more interesting for it.
438;This film could have done justice to it.
439;Really quick:I got this as one of my 5 free movies when I bought my Blu.
440;I remember the movie being on the slow side and not very engaging, but when I popped it in the player I found myself really enjoying it.
441;there's nothing special about the content, the movie's the same, but this is a great value and I'd definitely recommend it for the $15 it now cost.
442;maybe things are just better on Blu.
443;The movie was pretty good.
444;The action was intense and at some points it reminded me of Braveheart.
445;What surprised me the most was the humor in the movie.
446;If you want to see a good colonial movie, watch Last of the Mohicans.
447;If you want to see a good movie about revolution, watch Gladiator.
448;I thought this movie was gonna be so great in Blu Ray, well its AMAZING!Played it on my ps3 and must say it looks great!Btw amazon's packaging is quite good all the items i bought are in perfect condition!Thanks!
449;gettysburg probably had the best artillery special effects from the blackpowder era of warfare prior to this.
450;Baron von Steuben created the Continental army.
451;In the plantation South, the British offered slaves their freedom in exchange for military service with the British.
452;he likes this type of movie.
453;This has got to be one of the most awesome historical action adventure movies to hit the screens yet.
454;"This and ""Braveheart"" definitely demonstrate that Mel Gibson is an actor way ahead of his time."
455;The extended version is considerably better than the orginal and the video and sound make this a worth while Blu.
456;I love this movie it's soo good.
457;Great movie with Mel Gibson.
458;Both guys and gals will love this.
459;The British should feel flattered to be a target of Mel's hate, this is a man with strong views readers!!
460;Good old Mel, I look forward to his next version of history.
461;this movie does have some redeeming qualities the first battle I belive its supposed to be the battle of charleston is entertaining and fairly accurate.
462;I give credit to an excellent role of General Cornwallis played by (Tom Wilkinson).
463;One of my favorite historical movies!
464;I loved being able to find it on Amazon for such a good price!
465;I just read about 50 reviews that are here, and I feel compelled to write something myself.
466;So blanket statements about historical inaccuracies in this film are, well, inaccurate.
467;handedly wins the rev war in the south.
468;What IS historically accurate is the sacrifice our ancestors made to create this nation.
469;This movie makes it up close and personal.
470;his character is heroic and somewhat twisted.
471;He's caught up completely in his own anger,sorrow and desire for revenge, it's unbelievably intense, and the music in this spot is incredible, as it is throughout the entire movie.
472;It's not a John Williams score that stands on it's own as well as Star Wars, ET, or Indiana Jones, but the music fits the action and creates an amazingly super.
473;charged emotional backdrop for the film.
474;It's incredible cinema, and my favorite scene in the movie.
475;It's breathtaking, and stirs patriotism in the souls of most Americans.
476;Susan speaks is another phenomenal example of the power of the music in this movie.
477;"The ""Coplandesque"" music that occurs when Gabriel is recruiting men for the militia is also perfect for the scene."
478;And last but not least, the eerie trumpet theme that's played when dealing with Benjamin's twisted side is nothing short of genius.
479;the movie is visually stunning as well, from the military uniforms to the computer generated scenes and effects.
480;I love the French ships at Yorktown, to me it feels like I'm really there.
481;It really puts me through the ringer, and I love it!
482;anyone who loves the American Revolution should love this film.
483;The emotional impact is stunning.
484;It is my favorite movie of all time.
485;It's all opinion, and in this great land we can all express our opinions, and there's mine.
486;The cinematography is the high point in this emotional movie, with lots of pretty shots outside and inside.
487;It's just stunning at times, and on this Blu.
488;"ray release ""incredible"" is probably the best description of the transfer."
489;Kudos to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel for a job well done.
490;It's also a terrific audio movie with a lot of surround sound that's impressive, especially when the cannons are shot.
491;waving which nauseates some but makes most the U. s. citizens happy.
492;in all, a powerful story magnificently filmed.
493;This is a moving epic about the struggle for the American way of life during the American Revolution.
494;This movie is action/adventure fiction, but was well researched by it's creators, and based on real experiences of those who were involved in the conflicts.
495;He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
496;He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution.
497;"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people."""
498;"In ""The Patriot"", Benjamin Martin is fighting for his family and for the cause of the American people: Freedom and Independence."
499;It is disgusting to see, what crimes they committed against freedom itself!
500;But in the end we gained freedom!I have to thank the director and the cast members for this revelation!
501;The edited version is really good.
502;It has a lot of action, good storyline, drama, and even comedy.
503;Mel Gibson and the Late Heath Ledger are great actors in this movie.
504;Put me in the loved it category.
505;I viewed the film has a good piece of historical fiction with more Hollywood then History.
506;i enjoyed Mel Gibson's character and thought he acted superbly.
507;I thought the battle scenes were realistic while not always being historically acurate.
508;Benjamin Martin ends up leading the South Carolina malitia into battle against the juggernaut army England, the milita, very underestimated, helps turn the tide of the war and the colonists hold out until their friends across the Atlantic, the French, come and help win the war in favor for the new country, America.
509;This movie contains pure movie magic combined with,in my opinion, Mel Gibson's best performance yet to make a heart wrenching and touching story along with the realism of war that so often is lost in war movies.
510;but, it was also beautiful, Gibson, plays the loving, widowed, father of seven children.
511;i was on the edge of my seat through the entire 165 minutes of this griping and powerful film.
512;I have to say, its Well worth the .
513;I am one happy shopper!I cried.
514;i got angry and I got stunned.
515;I highly recommend this film, but must stress that it is graphic in violence, but there is a beauty to this film that overpowers that.
516;Except for the excessive bloody violence near beginning of this movie, this is one of my very favorite movies, and a top patriotic movie of them all.
517;Gibson is an incredible actor as well as producer/director and deserves a lot of accolade for many of his movies.
518;This is one of his very best, and love the historical time period as well as the story of this family at that time in history.
519;"One must step back from the film and ask, ""Was I entertained?"
520;The Patriot is certainly an enjoyable film visually.
521;The battle scenes are terrific and provide a plenty of visual and emotional interest.
522;handedly takes on a British regiment of twenty soldiers has some spectacular hatchet fighting and hand combat choreography.
523;This scene alone makes the film worth watching for any lover of guerilla tactics or knife fighting/close combat.
524;On top of the action, the screenplay is quite clever in parts, despite its tendency towards the sentimental.
525;But he plays this part well, the part of a man who alone can save a country from the oppressive enemy.
526;In the scenes where he deals with the loss of his family his acting is moving and quite believable.
527;there is much to dislike in this picture.
528;This movie tells the story of a man who fights for his family and, in doing this, for a new country and an ideal.
529;While the love stories seem contrived and thrown in, the love of family, the love of brotherhood and camaraderie, and the incredible action all make this an excellent film.
530;The Patriot,excells in both the acting and action categories!
531;Well produced and directed,the scenery is breathtaking,as well as the historical accuracy,I believe.
532;i highly recommend to anyone,especially those Revolutionary War buffs.
533;let's turn this into a film!
534;Every time you prayed for it to end, it just kept going.5) And finally, it did a brilliant job of making the audience cringe at every plot twist.
535;in conclusion, you should see this film.
536;I could go on about how bad it is, but to be honest, I liked it.
537;I laughed the whole way through, and it has taken over the Worst Film I've Ever Seen from Titanic.
538;This is a great movie (long but worth the sitting to watch it).
539;Full of twist and turns, brave mean and women!
540;I love American History and this movie I have added to my collection because the direction and the way that the story of a family's survival in the Revolution was tremendous.
541;mels family is terrorized, and he decides to take action by assemling a group of freedom fighters.
542;this movie is so dramatic and the acting is just simply amazing.You will even be impressed by the acting of the hatable enemies.
543;i can safely recommend this excellent movies to anyone who well.
544;anyone who likes watching good movies.
545;The patriot is a great movie hands down.
546;Mel Gibson is perfect for the part.
547;The revolutionary war is also put in a great persective.
548;That said, this film has star Mel Gibson's fingerprints all over the creative input.
549;This film is rousing entertainment, however.
550;The film kind of stacks the deck for the good guys.
551;The film also kind of inflates the role of militias in the winning of the war.
552;All kidding aside this is a thoroughly entertaining film that happens to use the American Revolution as it's backdrop.
553;Heath Ledger as his son gives a charismatic turn.
554;Really good camerawork here by Caleb Deschanel.
555;The definitive film about the American Revolution remains to be made.
556;Al came to the revolution by way of Brooklyn in that one.
557;This film may be a rehash of Braveheart , but there is one important difference.
558;It is definitely History for Dummies , with black hats on one side and white hats on the other.
559;Others have pointed ot the historical inaccuracies and unwarranted Brit.
560;OK, maybe I'm cranky because I just took my family to see the new musical 'Chicago' because it won Oscars, and it turned out to be mostly mind.
561;Americans fought each other also.
562;if you just want mindless entertainment than it is good.
563;"Mel Gibson's performances in ""The Patriot"" and ""Bravehart"" were outstanding."
564;Not wanting to be involved with the revolutionary war, Mel Gibson is drawn in when the British invade his property and home.
565;This is a movie, and it's meant to entertain you.
566;As a movie, this is one excellent piece of work.
567;Very moving, very exciting and very uplifting.
568;The story itself is interesting and has depth.
569;The scenery is well done, I felt like I was actually there.
570;This and Gladiator are definitely my favorite movies of 2000.
571;This film deserves6/5 stars .
572;I have been touched by very few motion pictures, but The Patriot is one that hit home.
573;Mel Gibson is excellent as Benjamin Martin, who has seen enough of war, and the horror it brings, but through no falt of his own is forced to take a stand, and become involved.
574;Shot on location, and with the superb musical score of John Williams, this film had the audience standing, and clapping as the end credits started to roll.
575;Many a tear was shed, both on screen, and in the theater.
576;The Patriot is another very good movie by Gibson .
577;entertaining, good plot, action, character development, and believable acting.
578;blu Ray adds greatly to this movie with superior definition, color, depth, and much better audio and soundtrack.
579;The extended cuts in this movie are value.
580;"certain movies are good candidates for Blu Ray
I:48;581;A family is provided to move the plot along.
I:48;582;A loyal wife and adorable little girls tug at our heart strings.
I:48;583;Isaacs is at his best when ordering the so called traitors burned alive in the church.
I:48;584;The director Roland Emmerich knows how to film scenes guaranteed to glue viewers to their seats even though this movie is longer than it should have been.
I:48;585;Great Britain was one the few noble countries strongly opposed to slavery.
I:48;586;the battle scenes are well done.
I:48;587;The Patriot is one the strangest major films ever produced.
I:48;588;It is in no way an accurate depiction of the early history of America's beginnings.
I:48;589;Also, Mel Gibson has got to redirect his career.
I:48;590;I'm sure the work pays well, but there's got to be a limit.
I:48;591;great service and price as well.
I:48;592;One of Gibson's greatest movies ever.
I:48;593;A chilling tale of the Revolutionary War and the trials of a family man.
I:48;594;The extended version of this film is a must have for anyone who is a big fan of the Patriot.
I:48;595;overall it was a decent film.
I:48;596;There are a lot of improvements from that version (I enjoy the extended cut), but yet the transition to blu.
I:48;597;A lot of the scenes are brought up to blu.
I:48;598;This happens periodically and at regular intervals of certain shots.
I:48;599;The Patriot is beautifully filmed in a state where I once lived.
I:48;600;The acting is great although Gibson occassionally seems a a bit awkward with the 18th Century dialect.
I:48;601;But it's a formula that works for him.
I:48;602;Heath Ledger was terrific in his breakthrough role as Gabriel Martin, and he looked the way one might picture the Angel Gabriel himself in his final scenes.
I:48;603;Accompanied by a cast full of beautiful young children, a strong but refined sister.
I:48;604;law who gives audiences an idea of the love that Martin and his children have missed played by an elegant Joely Richardson (Ironically a British actress and the real.
I:48;605;oddly enough, the best part of this movie was the English, vilified character of Colonel William Tavington, played by one of my top two actors, Jason Isaacs.
I:48;606;Isaacs has always been a phenomenal actor, and this time, I think, he saved this movie from flopping.
I:48;607;Great movie for the sake of seeing Isaacs in another awesome role.
I:48;608;It is great every time.
I:48;609;I love this time period and this movie depicts the war so well.
I:48;610;What I got instead was a story of a real hero, who put principle above all else.
I:48;611;Is this completely historically accurate?
I:48;612;The general theme is what is important and it should get everyone to think about how we got here as a nation.
I:48;613;People like the character in this film got us here.
I:48;614;This film made me proud and I was pleased to see that some revisionist cry babies didn't like this film.
I:48;615;Love history, love a movie about the Revolutionary War period.
I:48;616;Still holds up over time.
I:48;617;My son, Tom, has been involved in Revolutionary War reenacting since he was 10, and his first experience with film.
I:48;618;He thoroughly enjoyed the experience, although as a history scholar he had much to say about the film's shortcomings when it comes to historic detail.
I:48;619;Nevertheless, it caught the spirit of those times in a broad.
I:48;620;Nevertheless, The Patriot does capture the courage and determination of the American patriots who fought to make us free .
I:48;621;If you are looking for something closer to authentic history, try the History channel.
I:48;622;But if you want one hell of a story about a period in our history that most Americans have nearly forgotten, The Patriot is worth seeing.
I:48;623;and he was impressive to say the least.
I:48;624;ray transfer of this extended version is excellent and a special mention should be made of the excellent acting of Jason Issacs as the villainous British officier who forces Gibson's hand in a pivotal moment.
I:48;625;It is not a history lesson"
626;There were other people in the movie who also played their roles superbly.
627;It is a brutally real story of war in people's own backyards and towns, and focuses on one man's struggle to protect his family from the horrors of the war around them.
628;This film has good acting, great special effects, and battles that will blow you out of your seat.
629;He does his best withe the material he was given.
630;What made me give this film 3 stars is that even though Roland Emmerich is not what I consider a good director when it comes to character interaction, he did do a fine job on the battle sequences, much like in Independence Day , another film he did.
631;This is one of the best movies of the year.
632;It takes a lot for a 3 hour movie to keep my attention without running to the bathroom or going for a cig.
633;I am very pleased with my purchas.
634;Excellent movie and acting, Story superb if you can overlook hollywood political correctness recreating history
635;I love history and I love movies so this movie was just about perfect.
636;The action scenes were fantastic, and the story line was believable.
637;I would recommend this movie to anyone, in fact I think I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.
638;and how father loves his children and go to any extreme for them to protect the one's he loves.
639;I recommend you don't see this movie.
640;"If you like romanticised Hollywood history lessons, see ""Revolution"" with Al Pacino."
641;Much better film, much better story.
642;Besides all that, the movie itself will jerk a tear and make you proud of being an American.
643;Mel Gibson has always been a very powerful actor when he plays a father or a hero.
644;Ransom allows him to play the part of a caring and loving husband and father, which he does extremely well.
645;The Patriot, his latest movie, is yet another chance for him to show these character traits in fine form, matching his performance in Braveheart.
646;Gibson gives us an emotionally charged performance as the main character, proving his worth in Hollywood.
647;I have found that many historians and buffs have criticized the movie for its lack of authenticity, but if you don't have a clear knowledge of the events of the time period, or you can set aside your need for the true facts, then the movie works on the basis of its emotional and surprising plot.
648;It can be a bit trying at times, due to its length, and will test the patience of many viewers, but the material is solid and ends up pleasing us.
649;Gibson, along with Heath Ledger, have a unique father/son chemistry onscreen that is believable and emotional, hitting home for those interested in this aspect of the plot.
650;Martin and his men ride to many victories, keeping their honor and their dignity, but soon, Martin realizes that he will have to face the armies of the British head on in order to protect his family, now under the care of their Aunt Charlotte.
651;the movie has the overall look and feel of a big, booming epic, and while it's not up to scale such as past films like Braveheart and Titanic, it still is good, rousing entertainment for mass audiences.
652;another contributor to the movie's epic feel is the grand photography and cinematography, headed by photographer Caleb Deschanel, who brings lots of beauty and slow motion to the movie to bring us into the action as well as surrounding us with the unseen beauty of nature.
653;Lighting plays a key factor in certain scenes, most notably during the raid on Charlotte's house, adding a sense of heightened suspense to the moment.
654;the story, while relying on some formulaic elements, also keeps the movie's epic appearance up, following the trials and tribulations of a man whose life is in danger every minute of the movie's most intense moments.
655;Martin's story, while being fictional, is quite moving, powerful and emotional.
656;Benjamin has his values, which makes him an admirable character, and his children are embodied with those values, which makes the bond between father and family very strengthened and moving.
657;I, myself, do not know off the top my head anything about the Revolutionary War, and that is why I enjoyed this movie as I did because I don't have to worry about criticizing it for its accuracy or inaccuracy.
658;For me, everything else in this movie works, so I was able to find it satisfying.
659;just as Gibson gives his powerhouse performance, the rest of the cast also gives us stellar performances that add heart and feel to the movie.
660;Heath Ledger, who starred in 10 Things I Hate About You, takes on a very adult role in this movie, and does so with ease.
661;He brings all of this and more to the role.
662;Joely Richardson is Charlotte, strong and gentle, who cares for Benjamin's children and with whom she shares a strong chemistry, even if briefly.
663;while not the best epic ever made, The Patriot is by no means a failure, and its integrity, emotion, strength and intelligence all make it worthwhile in watching.
664;It dazzles the senses while keeping us intrigued by the story of one man's struggle to free his family from oppression.
665;He is portraying the character of a noble family man, simply wanting to live in peace.
666;The movie ends in a celebration of freedom.
667;The Patriot is the most successful movie of this season and I'm wondering why it wasn't nominated for anything in the golden globes while Gladiator was nominated.
668;If I rate Patriot part by part, I'll give 5 stars to Emmerich in the first place.
669;He's a talented director, although lots of people would disagree, he shooted ID.4 and Godzilla perfectly, the best way which can be made out of those foolish scripts.
670;For the first time, he has a good script, Patriot and he used his talents more than ever and shot a really powerful action.
671;The editing in that small battle will be a pure entertainment for those who love good edits.
672;The music by John Williams (The biggest movie score composer of all time) is as always, nothing to say much, it's perfect.
673;Acting is also good, especially Gibson performs his role very well.
674;natural ones which lead to the next important dialogues ( Gladiator is full of them ).
675;So the movie is the best of the season and also the year.
676;scenes, definitely watch this movie and if you want more than action, Patriot is also a good drama after all.
677;For those who know what makes a movie good : )
678;While I have seen THE PATRIOT on TV several times, I felt that the content of the movie and the caliber of the filming were such that it would be a good edition to the family movie collection.
679;The period clothes were exquisite, the scenery was breathtaking.
680;The magnitude of what this movie was about and the obstacles overcome to produce such an epic film was impressive.
681;He got an A+ !
682;The real Tarleton survived the war and went home to Great Britain.
683;Gibson's movie is great entertainment but very inaccurate history.
684;The screenwriter, who wrote Saving Private Ryan, knows better.
685;I thought this was a reasonably intelligent movie, despite the reviewers claims that it wallows in cliches and violence.
686;The film is visually elegant and if one can tolerate the violence, which is extensive, reasonably informative.
687;At any rate, while not exactly an historically accurate film, not much more than OK as a movie experience, still The Patriot is a reminder of just what we had to do to create a nation for ourselves.
688;the film is best in its action scenes, OK on delineating the home front.
689;Gibson does a satisfactory job and the rest of the cast does what they are allowed to do.
690;Real tough on a man who had to stand up as a beautiful target to do his job.
691;This movie is pretty much Braveheart.
692;The scotts are Americans, and the Brits are still Brits.
693;The beauty of that is: if you wished Braveheart would go on for another three hours!
694;The Patriot is one of the best movies ever made.
695;It is based on the true story of the American Revolution fought in South Carolina and it was filmed in South Carolina.
696;It was an incredible experience.
697;I had no idea what was sacraficed for our country to declare independence from the British, but this movie hit it home with an immersive story line, wonderful characters, and intense scenes.
698;This movie is a great classic movie.
699;It makes you proud to be an american.
700;I also feel like i'm getting a good lesson in history.
701;The movie carries a plot that's simply easy to follow, you don't have to be burying your head in history books to understand the storyline since I'm pretty sure 95% of it is fiction.
702;Although it tried to go neck to neck with the movie lenght of Braveheart but all in all the movie was very entertaining, not as gory, but a medium sized yikees will definitely pop out from the audience.
703;For the true War movie fan, this is a must own.
704;In my opinion the first modern epic to depict the War that created our great nation, and do it well.
705;With an all star cast who bring this picture to life, you get a sense of what it must of been like to live at this time.
706;I thought this aspect of the movie was extremely well done, and the inclusion of various cgi created battles made it seem even more horrific.
707;The story was good and interesting, especially for how long the movie was.
708;This has some neat looks at the making of the movie, as well as how some of the computer effects were done, which I always love to see.
709;There is also an average commentary track which is interesting to listen to.
710;I ordered this video for a Christmas surprise, and it arrived LONG before the stated delivery date, in perfect condition, and cheaper than the local Walmart.
711;A classic case of Americans revising history.
712;This movie is historically inaccurate, filled with lies and misrepresentations of what really happened.
713;I really overall liked this film.
714;The Patriot is one of my favorite movies and one of some best war movies ever made.
715;The Patriot is great, great movie that you would watch often since it's part of America's history.
716;Jason Issac was excellent actor as always even more deadly than his chacter of Mr. Malfoy himself!
717;harrison Ford turned down this role, angered that the film portrayed the Revolution as a one.
718;I'd have loved this film with Ford rather than Gibson, yet I can understand why Ford got angry about this fairy tale in lieu of some more solid, reliable history.
719;the year is 1776, and on the Martin farm it looks like all peace and tranquility.
720;Later, Benjamin is quartering both British and American wounded at his home.
721;I have to say, when we first saw this film, we thought it had great stuff in it that has influenced lots of subsequent films.
722;with extensive help and consultation courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution, Emmerich delivered a picture.
723;perfect, detailed rendering of that era not to be matched until HBO gave usJohn Adams.
724;Though a fictional story, most of the characters are based on real folks.
725;"He remarked, ""It was the sweat of the endeavor to free this country!"
726;There is a lot of sub.
727;par operatic music by John Williams, but an equally generous number of brilliant themes that show up in the HARRY POTTER films too.
728;furthermore, though I thought I detected a few added scenes in this special.
729;"all in all, if it is understood this is a fantasy (or ""fairy tale"") film with painstaking detail, it is not only worthy of viewing
I:48;730;You may not feel so patriotic about it, but you'll feel it's a good film.
I:48;731;Many reviewers here seem to despise it for some reason, but I loved it overall.
I:48;732;to love a film like this.
I:48;733;one final note: while I made what I saw as good edits to this review, I did not do it for the happiness or edification of any other reviewer here.
I:48;734;The acting was great and scenery was epic!
I:48;735;I found that The Patriot was a true portryal of the passion locked up in hate.
I:48;736;The degree realism makes you feel like you're really in the Revolution.
I:48;737;the love, passion, and tension among the characters is truly touching and so realistic.
I:48;738;I think that there must have been a lot left on the clipping room floor (pay really close attention to the aunt in the end) but overall the passionate story was true and captivating.
I:48;739;up more from the story the second time through!
I:48;740;This movie should be a classic!
I:48;741;Wonderful storyline, wonderful actors, wonderful everything.
I:48;742;Love this film, it makes you laugh, cry and feel a lot of other emotions when viewing.
I:48;743;Great performances by Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson.
I:48;744;Beautiful countrysides are shown with epic battle scenes that test every man's last breath to truly fight for what they believe in.
I:48;745;Fantastic and I give it five stars, it never loses value in repeated viewings for us.
I:48;746;The movie dragged at times, as well, despite the beautiful trappings"
747;educate myself on the real participants in the Revolutionary War.
748;But if you want a moving and compelling story about a reluctant hero's courageous fight for freedom, skip this movie and watch Gibson's powerful performance in Braveheart instead.
749;Good movie even though there are some historical inaccuracies.
750;It has a good plot and definitely makes you tear up in scenes.
751;'The Patriot' is fantastic, a truly great film.
752;wreching and moving, but still packed with action, this movie is sure to keep all audiences entertained!
753;Great acting by Mel Gibson and the young Heath Ledger.
754;Mel is really an amazing actor.
755;He can go from being a war hero in 'The Patriot' to be an egotistical jerk in the comedy 'What Women Want'!
756;Heath Ledger was great, he fit his role perfectly.
757;The sets, costumes, and historical information is excellent.
758;The dialogue and script is smart, emotional, and suspenseful.
759;One of the best movies of the year, excellent.
760;The action is good the story line is excellent.
761;Mel Gibson pulls off another excellent performance.
762;This is by far the best fim of 2000.
763;to begin with,I'm a true fan of Mel Gibson ,I like most of his recent works.
764;i've seen this movie on the wide screen ,and I tell you .
765;when I had first seen the poster and heard about the plot ,it blew my mind.
766;I thought to myself Five years have pasted since the last spectacular epic (BraveHeart).
767;it's time for another great historical performance of the man !
768;i'd come to see someting new and intelligent ,to discover this dissapointing consequence.
769;There are a lot of better films to see.
770;If you haven't seen BraveHeart by now,it's high time,because it is so much better than this one .
771;If you're into period movies, the costumes and political conflict of the setting will appeal to you.
772;This movie continues Mel Gibson's tradition of making very good action movies that contain a story, but this is no Braveheart.
773;The Patriot has great battle scenes that seem all too close to reality as does Braveheart, but lacks the compelling story to go with it.
774;don't get me wrong, the storyline is still good.
775;Mel Gibson as a father who realizes he must once again go to war for his country in order to protect his son is good.
776;sets and costumes are outstanding, as is the supporting cast.
777;the violence and gore should steer children away from this movie, but a good viewing for the mature audience.
778;Heath Ledger delivers another strong performance, and gives me faith that another excellent leading man is in the making here.
779;old Skye McCole Bartusiak gives a surprisingly skilled and intense performance as Susan, and I really look forward to seeing her in future roles.
780;In this film, she was one of those rare children's roles that I absolutely fell in love with.
781;While those roles certainly stand out, nearly everyone in this film gave their all, and on the whole, it's a wonderful piece.
782;"wrenching
I:48;783;There is suspense, action, betrayal, battles, romance, loyalty, and the best and worst of human traits.
I:48;784;I very much recommend this film for nearly everyone.
I:48;785;Computer generated sequences of the battles between the American freedom fighters and the British are well put together.
I:48;786;Two featurettes including the HBO First Look special.
I:48;787;It's worth watching for the bad diologue alone, but some people will find it exciting and a moving film.
I:48;788;Therefore it can be loved by all!
I:48;789;During our 4th of July, 2007 celebration, we decided to see this movie to put the birth of our nation into perspective.
I:48;790;the hero, Benjamin Martin is the consolidation of many patriots, and it surfaces the tremendous sacrifice endured by our ancestors, who survived through the destruction of their homes and the trauma of losing family members to the cruelty displayed by many a British soldier.
I:48;791;benjamin Martin, masterfully played by Mel Gibson, is a hero of the French.
I:48;792;for the gift that it represents to live our lives guided by the precious document represented by our Constitution, and with the awesome responsibility of doing whatever it takes to ensure that the USA remain.
I:48;793;Mel is one of my favourite actors and I love nearly all he does, but this one while being very watchable just goes off target.
I:48;794;First the good news"
795;Mel Gibson is outstanding at his leading.
796;The story flows quite nicely, and the script is neither overbearing nor ponderous.
797;This is yet another movie that had great potential to entertain and teach but once again it provided miseducation and some flashy effects.
798;That was the one scene that really got me.
799;Of course Gibson is a trememdously talented actor and plays the part well of a commander who is hesitant about joining the war due to some lingering guilt from the French and Indian war.
800;jason Isaacs was also a good actor.
801;Some people are just born to play the villan, and he is one of them.
802;All men created equal, give me a break.
803;the best scene had to be the end, when Martin kept his promise to kill Tavington, he went for the jugular!
804;This is a movie that every true American should see.
805;Like Braveheart, it tells of one man's quest for freedom against insurmountable odds.
806;I'm not one for war films usually, but I liked this one.
807;The filming is beautifully done and for me there is enough personal plot involved, it's been ratified that way.
808;the acting is good as well as the scenery as I've already said and it's good for being at battle movie!
809;"I fully suspect that if you see this film before you see Braveheart, you'll think this one the better
I:48;810;Mel Gibson is completely convincing as the nearly superhuman minuteman.
I:48;811;The acting was OK"
812;good to see once in the theater, and again at home.
813;Visually stunning and superbly acted,this film is a definite winner.
814;Time passes,with the fighting drawing ever closer to the Martin homestead.
815;we watch,his eldest son grow to manhood and in his own right,become better than his father.
816;And in the end we see freedom gained and honor to those who were lost.
817;thrilling and breathtaking,this is fictional history at its best.
818;Let me start by saying that this is one hex of a great film.
819;mel Gibson's character is a composite of two historically famous indiviuals: Francis Marion and Daniel Morgan.
820;If there is one message that comes across clearly in this film that is it.
821;The Patriot is an extraordinarily graphic and compelling depiction of 18th Century warfare.
822;other than that criticism, which is more a matter of personal preference, this film was extraordinary.
823;With this film, Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day) has moved beyond schlocky sensational films and actually assembled a substantial film with a story that wasn't tongue in cheek.
824;If there is one area where Emmerich excels, it is visual effects, and this film is another shining example of that.
825;His choreography of the combat with thousands of extras was magnificent.
826;The costume design by Deborah Lynn Scott (Wild, Wild West, Titanic) was superlative.
827;The entire period was fantastically rendered.
828;He was outstanding in every scene.
829;this was a masterful filmmaking achievement that went a bit overboard on the sentimental side.
830;It was highly entertaining with a strong and engaging story and characters with whom it was easy to identify.
831;this was a war you know) It is beautifully filmed and edited.
832;I let my 10 year old son watch it with me.
833;I thought it accurately portrayed the real cost of freedom and war.
834;Well made and highly recommended.
835;BEFORE the battle Morgan was a real hero that is bigger than any fiction portrayed by the patriot.
836;the truth is BY FAR more compelling than this fiction.
837;Full of action and realism.
838;Mel Gibson is a great actor.
839;concerning, perhaps, the most important war in American history.
840;Historians, like myself, will nevertheless tip their hats to the screenwriters who based many of the characters in part on real historical figures.
841;Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin, is sort of a mix between the very real Daniel Morgan and the very real Nathaniel Green.
842;given that the costuming and special effects with the battle scenes seem right on the money, you'd think that this movie would hit the bulls eye in terms of its historical value as well as its entertainment value.
843;well, that's going a bit too far for me.
844;There is indeed intense action and some degree of suspense throughout.
845;This movie has been a favorite in my family for years.
846;My son chose this movie for a history project.
847;He has enjoyed the characterzations and the actions.
848;roland Emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects.
849;he also has great help from the cast.
850;Mel Gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war.
851;Heath Ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.
852;First of, The Patriot itself is a great movie with a captivating story.
853;no doubt did it make an interesting story around the events of the revolutionary war (And a partly true story at that).
854;This is a nice edition to your collection.
855;I'm happy to have it, but learned if I still had my original and bought this.
856;It seemed for a time that Mel Gibson thought that the one thing that makes a new picture better than his last picture is a higher body count.
857;minute body count, but I thought this was an interesting tale.
858;how can a superpower, and Britain the strongest superpower of the time, lose a war against underequipped, ill.
859;well, you get the drift).
860;the battlefield drama, the struggle to decide what is right and wrong, the fight with the inner demons and the past, make this an interesting psychological drama despite the pile of dead bodies in the background.
861;the costs were staggering, but this held all the elements for a summer blockbuster .
862;star power, compelling theme (ID 4 also grabbed the July holiday slot, and did well, and shares many of the same people in production with The Patriot).
863;this movie shows in stark terms some of the conditions and costs of the American Revolution/War with the Colonies.
864;It is perhaps one of the more regrettable wars in human history, much more akin to the American Civil War a century later, as it pitted relatives and friends against each other.
865;It is a absolutley wonderful movie with a solid script.
866;It is about the American Revolution!
867;It clearly represents a triumph over evil in the end, and sets up perfectly, the Reconstruction era that followed.
868;A great movie for 13 and above.
869;I think this movie does a good job of walking the line between telling a patriotic story about a war that I'm glad we won on one hand, and making war look too glamorous and fun on the other.
870;what the heck were they doing?But overall I liked this movie and feel it is at least a decent effort in a badly neglected area.
871;This is a very well produced movie with an excellent cast and wonderful action.
872;If you liked Braveheart then you will love this.
873;But it's the most apt description I've heard.
874;It's pure action, pure revenge, pure adrenaline.
875;"The scene where he eliminates a 20 man British contingent is definitely a cool sequence
I:48;876;Cool movie, not exactly Oscar material.
I:48;877;This movie was truly entertaining and great to watch!
I:48;878;I lovedthe storyline and all the characters!
I:48;879;Thank you, and enjoy The Patriot!
I:48;880;Some very good action sequences and good computer graphics make up for a lot.
I:48;881;By the end of the film Ben's kids are their own cousinsC.
I:48;882;this was a great movie.
I:48;883;the best civil war movie i have seen in along time.
I:48;884;This is possibly the best movie ever created.
I:48;885;All in all, it's the greatest movie ever made about the Revolutionary War, and the best performance by Mel Gibson.
I:48;886;Even though I was a Brit I went to see this film with an open mind.
I:48;887;I was hoping to see a good epic that would rival Braveheart, Gladiator and Last of the Mohicans.
I:48;888;The battle scenes were pretty spectacular although unless you are an American you will be ill at all the flag waving that goes on.
I:48;889;It provided a realistic depiction of what a father feels toward family and children.
I:48;890;And the way he goes after his revenge is sweet!
I:48;891;It is deserving and justified.
I:48;892;Yeah, in part it is.
I:48;893;He can greenlight films and he certainly has creative control over just about any picture he's involved with.
I:48;894;the film is well developed and over all, effective, but the climactic final scene is anything but climactic or satisfying.
I:48;895;I am a huge fan of this movie.
I:48;896;if anyone feels that I'm simply making that up, they are welcome to look the following incidents up for themselves.1.
I:48;897;a whole community, including dozens of women and children, were butchered with hatchets and tomahawks3.
I:48;898;They knew full well how these people operated.
I:48;899;He is heavily based upon Banastre Tarleton, but there are elements of other people in his character, as well.
I:48;900;This has led some to call him a mere caricature.
I:48;901;Overall, the movie gives him credit in the area where the real.
I:48;902;Tavington is depicted as fully the equal of the hero in regards to strength and courage.
I:48;903;All in all, though, I do feel that the Patriot is a better exploration of the motivations behind fighting than most war movies.
I:48;904;in the end, I love the movie and the extras are pretty good.
I:48;905;Most of the criticism is rooted in validity, but is excessive in tone.
I:48;906;But for people who love adventure stories that feature strong, charismatic characters, I would recommend this one highly.
I:48;907;Beautifull costumes, scenery, music!If you loved Braveheart, don't hesitate.
I:48;908;This film is very interesting.
I:48;909;A great opportunity to make a Rev War battle flick that outdid the modest British.
I:48;910;Interesting story with a number of historically real characters rolled into the one Benjamin Martin.
I:48;911;Otherwise an enjoyable movie that a war movie buff will most certainly enjoy.
I:48;912;The strength of THE PATRIOT is that it is a large budgeted film set during colonial America and the American Revolution.
I:48;913;The ambush that erupts is an incredibly filmed and edited and very powerful scene with muskets being fired and rapidly reloaded by Gibson's two youngest sons as Gibson darts back and forth being trees firing on the column.
I:48;914;it is interesting to watch Gibson's rage during these moments.
I:48;915;As an actor he is totally focused during this scene.
I:48;916;Chris Cooper playing Gibson's former commander Colonel Harry Burwell is very well cast and gives a much levelheaded performance as the colonial military leader.
I:48;917;Tom Wilkinson playing Lord Cornwallis is brilliant as always and is a great leveling counterpart to the evil Colonel William Tavington played by Jason Isaacs.
I:48;918;Isaacs is so good at unlikeable characters.
I:48;919;In all, I watch this film from time to time and enjoy the parts I like and overlook a lot of things I do not like about this film.
I:48;920;And that is why I love history books.
I:48;921;And who wants a war?It's bloody (midway between Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan) and the story is pretty historically inaccurate, but you'll still have a great time enjoying it if you take it for what it's worth.
I:48;922;But on that note, it is very entertaining and easy to get into.
I:48;923;I ordered the Patriot special edition for my collection.
I:48;924;When I got the package and opened it no Patriot!
I:48;925;The story and acting is above average.
I:48;926;The sources of the artillery firing was accurately positioned and you can actually tell which direction the distant rumbles were coming from.
I:48;927;It is one of the Most touching movies i have ever seen.
I:48;928;It Truely made me proud to be American.
I:48;929;I would recommend it to all my friends and would watch it over and over again.
I:48;930;What are you going to do next .
I:48;931;highly recommended for fans of the American Revolutionary war, Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger.
I:48;932;it is well worth a look.
I:48;933;The performances from everyone are top.
I:48;934;I liked this film the first time I watched it.
I:48;935;I had high hopes for this flick.
I:48;936;There are some very good scenes in it, like the ambush early on and some of the battles.
I:48;937;Because you can't help but keep comparing and frankly Brave Heart is better.
I:48;938;third, all the way while watching the movie you can predict what is going to happen next.
I:48;939;but still, it is worth watching.
I:48;940;what to say, ummm it's a great movie.
I:48;941;bought it new in the box.
I:48;942;Well, I suppose I should be happy that any major studio is daring to touch American history as a subject again"
943;the rumors are mostly true: it is in essence Braveheart transplanted to the American revolution.
944;I shudder to think of this movie being used as history education.
945;I was curious enough to see it through to the finish (although I fast.
946;I loved very much this movie.
947;the movie is very realistic and interesting.
948;It shows how brave were the Americans for their liberty.
949;the actors act very well.
950;the costumes are perfect and guide the viewer to another time and place.
951;The cast is masterful at what they do, and the writers have truly made a movie that has brought the story full circle as well as developed a plot making the audience think about the true value of family, and patriotism, and how the two work togetherThe Patriot is a movie about a man named Ben (Mel Gibson), a hero of the French and Indian War.
952;Ben's unique and somewhat savage way of fighting is described by a survivor of the battle.
953;The Patriot shows Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger at their best.
954;Mel Gibson, appeals to his emotive memories enriching his character with proportional doses of Mad Max, Lethal weapon and Braveheart.
955;The photography is extremely mesmerizing and its better merit, but even the brutal sequences of the wounds of the mortal cannons and a touching performance of Chris Cooper may dignify in its most legitimate splendor what it could have been a revitalization of the courage and honor and not becoming an overlong melodrama with unjustified and almost imperceptible mistakes as that sequence when the Troops arrive to town briefly after the sinister church's massacre.
956;This was a wonderful film!
957;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger turned out great performances!
958;He was very good and played well against Mel Gibson.
959;In fact, his scene with Mel Gibson is one of the most memorable in the film.
960;He is very loyal to his superior and has the accent/dialect of a perfect gentleman.
961;Hopefully, we will see more of Tom Wilkinson and Peter Woodward in films with an historical setting.
962;They are great in these movies!
963;Bittersweet to see a young and promising Heath Ledger.
964;The Patriot is an absolute must.
965;All the actors were wonderful.
966;Mel Gibson gave a great performance, as did Heath Ledger and all the other young actors who played his children.
967;Everyone should see this movie.
968;This movie is a wonderful piece of work, and I'm glad I actually knew that it wasn't trying to accurately portray real.
969;So put your inaccurate criticisms to the side and sit back and enjoy one of Mel's best movies.
970;Also from the perspective that aside from being so flawed it was fun to watch.
971;I still believe he was a great man and an even greater general.
972;He alone devised the strategy to defeat a much more powerful force through attrition, economics, and political stalemates.
973;Also the Founding Brothers is a good read.
974;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger give outstanding performances in this movie and truly pull your heart strings.
975;I cried laughed and really thought while watching this movie.
976;This is an excellent movie!
977;Its a true patriotic movie.
978;It reminds us of our roots.
979;The movie itself is entertaining, well acted and the cinematography in particular is excellent.
980;Ask anyone who has studied the American revolution and they will tell you both sides committed some horrendous acts of war.
981;To any Americans reading this, I love the USA and it's people,the vast majority of you I know are intelligent enough to see this movie for what it is but movies such as this one do not help transatlantic relations.
982;This is one of the best movies ever made.
983;the acting is believable and appropriate for each character.
984;The battle scenes are riveting and realistic.
985;The story pulls you in and holds you to the end.
986;You believe these characters and relate to them, especially if you have a family of your own.
987;This movie impacts you on a very emotional level, as well as a visual and intellectual one.
988;In other words, it gives you a true respect and appreciation for those rag.
989;It truly puts you THERE, and that is really what a movie is supposed to do.
990;That is why it becomes so personal, as you are drawn into the lives of these brave early Americans.
991;The war does serve as a backdrop, but an important one that defines who these people are and why they are that way.
992;It truly embodies the spirit that we in America are feeling at this trying time in our nation, so watch it and be encouraged.
993;Mel Gibson spiked up another great mix of Brave Heart and Gladiator in this flict.
994;There was a lot of violent but this is another war drama, and war always not pretty and glory like Hollywood depicted in the past.
995;Visually impressive but Gibson reprises his sensitive hero shtick.
996;In the movie the British kill injured American troops, Gibson offers to free the slaves if they will fight forthe Revolution and the British burn civilians in a church.
997;This film Patriot unfairly portrays the Americans as universally noble, fair, kind, heroic, gallant, patriotic warriors who are even nice to their slaves and bravely endeavouring to shake off the yoke of British imperialism.
998;hand combat with the help of his sons.
999;top politically correct civics lesson on race that has nothing in common with real history.
1000;and then emphatically repeats himself, just to impress us with the filmmakers' sincerity.

1002;It is a Historical fiction Hollywood movie about a family who lives in South Carolina in 1776 whose lives are deeply affected by the American Revolution.
1003;Benjamin, the protagonist, his family and the other colonials are portrayed as loyal patriots who are noble, brave, and determined to fight off British aggression.
1004;Benjamin's oldest son, Gabriel, is portrayed as brave and noble.
1005;human because Benjamin, a loyal patriot, was taking care of wounded British soldiers also.
1006;Benjamins 2nd oldest son, Thomas, decides to attempt to save his older brother Gabriel, however despite his brave actions, Thomas gets shot right through his heart by Tavington.
1007;This is symbolic because the movie is further suggesting that the Americans are being forced into this war and no longer have a choice in the matter because it is affecting their personal lives.
1008;Benjamin looks noble and determined.
1009;The movie also again uses children here to make the British look especially evil.
1010;The end justifies the means.
1011;after rescuing Gabriel, Benjamin's young son is upset that he killed British soldiers with his father.
1012;America feels it has a right to do whatever it takes to win as long as America feels it is on the morally right side of dishing out justice.
1013;The ends justify the means to America and to Benjamin.
1014;The director and writers of this movie obviously felt that America is exceptional, and they obviously have a distorted view of American foreign policy.
1015;But I did enjoy watching the movie.
1016;The action, acting, and directing were great on all accounts, and most of the basic history was true.
1017;If you want to simply learn history that hasn't been warped by the progrssives in this country then do some research and study, otherwise enjoy this great movie.
1018;This is a great movie, no.
1019;one claimed it was meant to be a documentary, movies are about entertainment and escapism, and this certainly delivers both.
1020;Hollywood provides fast paced entertainment, and leaves historical fact to the museums, this has always been so and I don't understand why people are suddenly complaining about factual accuracy.
1021;"Braveheart was a huge success and it was wildly inaccurate to anyone who has even a passing knowledge in Scottish history, but it was hugely entertaining at the same time, and may have inspired many people to seek further information on what really happened
I:48;1022;They sing joyous music when British soldiers (Who at the time was the best army in the world)are shot and getting killed and their stomachs are ripping out but when an American who gets wounded it's the end of the world.
I:48;1023;The movie makes it seem as if the British are soooooooo Evil and the Americans are gods.
I:48;1024;I'm a great fan of this film, and its actors.
I:48;1025;That would be very nice.
I:48;1026;One of Mel Gibson's Best movies.
I:48;1027;It was good ten years ago and its still good today!
I:48;1028;A timeless classic that I will always be glad I own!
I:48;1029;it felt real, and the reactions of all the other characters felt real as well"
1030;one of my top movies of all time.
1031;This was a very good movie.
1032;This is and AMERICN made movie and we Americans are very patrotic.
1033;I think that this was a very good movie about the history of the Revolutionary War.
1034;There are parts in the movie that are disgusting like someone's head gets blown off but it is really interesting to see what the war was like.
1035;I saw this film in my school and I loved it.
1036;Mel Gibson gives us a very powerful and moving performance as Benjamin Martin, a man haunted by past actions and doesn't want to get into the Revolutionary War along with the fact he has 7 kids.
1037;as you can tell this movie has some great performances and writing.
1038;Movies are entertainment and usually I don't care when I movie gets some things wrong, but I guess I care when the movie is about the most important event in American history.
1039;in this emotionally charged movie.
1040;When the British do arrive at his South Carolina home and endanger the things that he holds closest, and his son joins the American army, Martin finally does decide to go to war, leading a militia into battle against an overwhelming English army.
1041;the Patriot will make you proud to be an American.
1042;The Patriot is a really entertaining movie and that's what counts.
1043;Sure the Americans look like warm.
1044;And like I said the movie is very entertaining despite it's few faults.
1045;I think this one of his best, the movie is realistic, becouse you can see how dificult this was to the colonies, and you can feel all of it, when the soldier kills his son and then he beggins to fight for it, his actuation was so real, and it has a very good especial efects, so if haven't seen it you are losting one of the best movies, really !
1046;came real fast and great price and another Mel Gibson great movie with great picture and sound.
1047;The Patriot manages to be both inspirational and historically accurate (for the most part) as it tells the story of the last phase of the Revolution.
1048;Customers, see The Patriot for yourself.
1049;fi flick light years better than the Phanthom Menace.
1050;The acting in The Patriot is excellent.
1051;Battle scenes are vivid, bloody and convincing.
1052;Gibson's family are warm, humorous, Caleb Deschnagel's cinematography is burnished and the southern landscapes are fabulous to behold.
1053;Scene after scene are well.
1054;Emmerich has directed a major film on the subject of the American Revolution.
1055;The Patriot shows a good picture of what it must have been like to live and fight in the eighteen century.
1056;It is a bold, exciting, thrilling movie.
1057;It is a wonderfully spun tale of freedom, war, revenge, love and family, and redemption.
1058;What could the movie lover want with all the fine qualities The Patriot has going for it?
1059;Every American needs to see this movie and the history of this once great nation, it is moving and has facts in the story line also!!!!
1060;i strongly recommend avoiding this movie if you are a fan of great period movies such as Gettysburg, Gods and Generals, The Duelists, Last of the Mohicans and Barry Lyndon (for starters).
1061;That in itself should keep people away from it.
1062;I loved the costuming and scenery, and the sniper.
1063;the BD transfer is bright and sharp, so background elements have far more detail.
1064;The BD version is a revolution in clarity.
1065;Unlike Troy, its clear many of the props and sets appear life like and made of 'real stuff' versus stucco or papier mache.
1066;The Patriot is a prime example.
1067;it simply pains me that the real drama of American history, which could entertain as well or better than anything Hollywood has so far made about the war that led to our nationhood is so consistently and blatantly ignored by a media whose capacity depicting such things is full of potential.
1068;the Patriot tugs at every conventional heartstring, and its effects are extraordinary.
1069;There is a difference for the better.
1070;If you don't mind paying a little more, it's worth the better picture you get.
1071;My great grandfather was one of them.
1072;up to the amazing success of Saving Private Ryan, its creators decided to try their hand at the American Revolution.
1073;Their idea turned into another amazing epic.
1074;Mel Gibson shines brilliantly as a soldier.
1075;a relative newcomer (to me anyway) Heath Ledger is also amazing as the son, Gabriel, who joins with the American forces.
1076;there are epic battles, daring escapades, romance, and even some light.
1077;heared comedy in this sweeping epic.
1078;The Patriot has heart, soul, humor, an so mch more.
1079;Although some of the characters in the movie are fictitious, I found it very refreshing that a great deal of historical data was presented throughout.
1080;This is one amazing film!!
1081;Students appeared to enjoy the content.
1082;He sends his remaining five children to live with their Aunt Charlotte and he joins the militia.
1083;The story continues on with the militia and the British continuously fighting each other till the end.
1084;this film involves some comic as well as emotional scenes.
1085;I truly enjoyed watching this film.
1086;When this movie was first in preproduction, I was very excited, hoping that we would at last see a revolutionary war movie that would elevate this most fascinating period of our history to the status that it deserved.
1087;(Jason Isaacs at least has the advantage of actually being a capable and interesting actor, which Gibson hasn't been since Gallipoli. )
1088;All the actors were grand, esp of course, Gibson as well as Ledger, but Richardson and Brenner held their own in this company of men.
1089;My husband and I were very impressed with The Patriot!
1090;Whoever thought that lining up in a big mass in front of a group of musket.
1091;wielding automatons was a good idea, is a military leader without a hint of imagination.
1092;fAVORITE BATTLE(S): In the most memorable scene of the movie, Benjamin takes his two youngest sons .
1093;After setting up a rudimentary ambush and supplying the kids with a few words of wisdom, Benjamin almost single.
1094;I have seen many War movies and dramas, Bravehart being one of the best.
1095;"But The ""Patriot"" now takes the crown for ""Best war drama""."
1096;What this movie does so well that others have tried but failed is blend realism,Drama,anger,rage,and tenderness all in an epic package.
1097;I will share this movie with my family to remind them why not to take this Freedom for grannet and to remember those who gave there lives so that we can live in liberty.
1098;I really liked Patriot because it is a departure from the revisionist history thinking that was so prevalent in the 90's.
1099;The portrayal of the British represents the nation as it was 200 years ago .
1100;I think that patriot was well acted and tells a good story depicting a war that not many of us know much about.
1101;This is a good movie, rather long but one that will entertain throughout.
1102;The best of Mel Gibson, great piece of history, Heath Ledger in his first great job, Recommended at 100%, you need to see it
1103;Tom Wilkerson, and Peter Woodward look dashing in those red coats as well.
1104;Those Brits make me proud of my British hertitage as well.
1105;Several years ago at a 4th of July parade I found myself next to an English tourist, and we got to talking about the holiday.
1106;And of course now most Americans consider the British our staunchest friends and allies.
1107;John WIlliams rousing score is the perfect background to the show in the sky.
1108;This is a great movie that I consider a classic.
1109;The movie is historically based on the US Revolutionary War with some of the key characters based on a combination several actual historical figures.
1110;ray version of this movie is incredible with great details, as should be expected with Blu.
1111;It was another excellent time piece by Mel Gibson.
1112;If you loved Braveheart you will love this.
1113;born actors rugged or handsome enough to take lead role in a film about the defining moment in US nationhood?
1114;that final, hopeful image is almost certainly well.
1115;The photography is outstanding and the pace is well.
1116;It's a touch gruesome in places, but strongly recommended.
1117;"It's a good thing we know how to cross oceans with firearms, otherwise they would have killed us all by now.Yet it has a ""patriotic"" tone and theme, and therefore we must be polite."
1118;After the success of Saving Private Ryan, the screenwriter was directed to come up with something fast.
1119;the origins of the American Revolution are mystery.
1120;The Patriot is one of the best films I saw during the summer of 2000.
1121;I personally think the true stories of the Revolutionary war are much more interesting.
1122;Example, the love interest between Mel and the character of his departed wife's sister.
1123;The supporting cast provided the best in terms of it.
1124;This is a recomendation to see from me.
1125;ray since it has a much sharper picture, good movie, lots of action.
1126;*The Patriot* gives the Revolutionary War the Emmerich treatment: it's a big, exciting, melodramatic, feel.
1127;good movie with wonderful production values and splendid widescreen cinematography.
1128;a thorouhgly enjoyable experience for someone like me, who live in France, a country where anti.
1129;What I hope is that *The Patriot* will both give a glimpse of greatness to its viewers and stimulate their interest in the War of Independence.
1130;"*, has written excellent novels on the Revolutionary War
I:48;1131;The Patriot is a great movie.
I:48;1132;He enjoys this type of movie when he wants to sit and relax.
I:48;1133;This film gripped me throughout, reminding me constantly of the sacrifices made to win our amazing country and the individuals destined to pay the greatest of prices.
I:48;1134;i was frequently reminded that individuals may not have pristine reasons to justify their participation in the horrors of war but our reflection on their sacrifice, from which all Americans have benefited, elevates their actions to heroic proportions.
I:48;1135;This movie just recently was voted the best historical film of 2000 by viwers of the History Channel.
I:48;1136;To which all I can say is perhaps those who enjoy and know their history can just sit back and enjoy this movie.
I:48;1137;Well good grief this is a story about Benjamin Martin, his family and their struggle to fight and survive a war.
I:48;1138;good for Gibson and the other individuals connected to this movie.
I:48;1139;fashioned style epic with all the strengths and weaknesses associated with the genere.
I:48;1140;It's popular enertainment and I for one enjoyed it.
I:48;1141;It's sweeping, emotional, amusing and sad.
I:48;1142;I felt like it moved along briskly and never lagged.
I:48;1143;One minute it is love story, war story, or revenge story.
I:48;1144;If you like corny and cheesy movies this is one for you.
I:48;1145;mel Gibson's character, Colonel Benjamin Martin, is conflicted on many levels and having seen and served in the French.
I:48;1146;He also knows that it will change his sons forever and the way that their manhood will be forged through the crucible of war and the emotional toll it will encompass.
I:48;1147;should """"The Patriot"""" should be gauged as a success?"""
1148;"If at the end of the movie you are reflecting upon the sacrifices of those who gave their lives for future generations in the name of patriotism, then ""The Patriot"" has succeeded, as it did for me."
1149;So many of our young people have no idea of what true freedom is, let alone how we got it in this nation.
1150;In fact, one of the main reasons we won the war was due to the fact that so many Brits, even in Parliament, openly supported the American cause.
1151;Cornwallis's attitude in the movie is probably closer to the truth than most .
1152;all in all, it was a good time, but the History Channel is more interesting to those who want the down to earth truth.
1153;Leading a band of fighters thought to be of no consequence, the hero accomplishes the improbable.
1154;unlike some formula films, this is an engaging movie.
1155;There are bits of romance and humor to keep the film from being too dark.
1156;I would recommend watching this movie.
1157;This was a well put together movie.
1158;it's supposed to entertain, and I was entertained.
1159;some reviews also seem to imply that it's a cookie.
1160;True to some extent, but I'd say it's more a cookie.
1161;But there's more to it than that.
1162;He has a family to protect and fight with on occassion, with some very harrowing scenes.
1163;If it were allowed, I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.
1164;What with the disappointing (yet visually exciting) releases of Mission:Impossible 2 and X. men, I was expecting a film that would surpass the other summer movies and surprise the viewers with a story that would capture and involve the audience while pleasing them with exciting visuals.
1165;and so is The Patriot.
1166;Jason Isaacs gives a brilliant performance as the evil Colonel Tavington, and anyone who enjoyed him in the movie will love the Tavington centered deleted scenes.
1167;deleted scenes or not, this film is incredible from start to finish.
1168;Mel Gibson is intense as Benjamin Martin, and the lovely Joely Richardson brings warmth to the screen.
1169;The children, played by magnificent young actors, were equally good.
1170;It keeps me entranced every time.
1171;It is an action flick with a heart of gold, complete with a beautiful score and gorgeous cinematography.
1172;Simply put, I believe this movie to be excellent for anyone desperate for an involving, well.
1173;It is truly a memorable experience!
1174;Love the movie but there is a glitch that happens every so often in the movie.
1175;The effects were excellent insofar as the cannonblasts, and the story was able to hold me.
1176;All in all, this makes for a good friday night on the couch movie.
1177;Isaacs and Gibson both excell in this action filled movie.
1178;After all the movie looks more stunning than ever.
1179;I was very excited when I discovered that the Patriot was being re.
1180;The Patriot was a great movie and the re.
1181;pubecent sons taking out a platoon of the world's finest soldiers!
1182;most of the slaves actually sided with the British because of their offer of freedom.
1183;"The scene on the beach reminded me of the party the Ewoks held at the end of ""Return of the Jedi""."
1184;I almost jumped out of my seat and cheered.
1185;He is a master in armed combat and they free his son.
1186;this is a very good movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it.
1187;I know that many parts of the movie are not historically correct but it is entertaining and action packed.
1188;"I think you might like it also
I:48;1189;As a South Carolinian, watching The Patriot was a very personal experience for me.
I:48;1190;It is a great honor to me as a South Carolinian to see such a wonderful movie that pays tribute to the brave men from my home state who gave their lives for the cause of Liberty.
I:48;1191;Like Saving Private Ryan, anyone who does not feel Patriotic and thankful for these brave people after watching this movie, should question their own love for this great nation.
I:48;1192;The Patriot is a must see movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone.
I:48;1193;This film wonderfully depicts the heartbreaking toll that war takes.
I:48;1194;Mel Gibson has made a wonderful transition from heart throb to character actor.
I:48;1195;This film is full of wonderful actors.
I:48;1196;The story is believable and moving and the battle sequences are realistic.
I:48;1197;There are a few laugh out loud moments as well.
I:48;1198;Watching this one will make you very proud to be an American.
I:48;1199;I don't usually like violent movies, but this one is great because it captures history during war time.
I:48;1200;There are some amazing war scenes here small and big.
I:48;1201;aside from the violent footage there are some touching scenes that really get you in the heart as you wacth this epic movie.
I:48;1202;The deleted scenes are cool to see.
I:48;1203;The making of the film is intresting to see.
I:48;1204;I give this five stars for good war scenes and that's it.
I:48;1205;Imagine Jim Anderson, the paternal title character from TV's Father Knows Best , suddenly revealing his inner Rambo .
I:48;1206;handedly inspiring America to win the decisive battle that spells the eventual end of the Revolutionary War.
I:48;1207;And yet that is the general premise of The Patriot .
I:48;1208;His performance hits basically three notes throughout: wise patriarch"
1209;There are also some eye.
1210;It's less sophisticated technically, but a lot more satisfying intellectually than The Patriot .
1211;He finally did something right.
1212;Unlike his previous films, this one actually has some meaning to it.
1213;The Patriot is about a man whose faith and beliefs about war intersects with what is more important: his family, but also takes us down the road in American history.
1214;depth historical masterpiece, but it still gives you a good idea of what went on, and it's also a good 2 1/2 hours of your time.
1215;Anyways, outstanding performances are evident throughout.
1216;Jason Isaacs probably gives the highlight performance of the movie, playing the kind of character you just want to chuck something at.
1217;The movie has an obsessed balance of grittiness and comedy, which worked great.
1218;Who knows, but what counts is that we got a good idea of both.
1219;The Patriot is well worth the money, but it is basically a big summer movie painted over with the American Revolution.
1220;It supplies many laughs, tears, and triumph, but not so much on history.
1221;You have a perfect summer movie anyways right?
1222;liter Coke and enjoy yourself some 2 1/2 hours.
1223;Giving us characters that we care about, soldier and civilian alike, the movie develops a relationship between the audience and the characters.
1224;the spirit of this movie soars, as does the technical achievement.
1225;"Roland Emmerich's direction is conventional but steady
I:48;1226;The acting is equally solid, and John Williams' score equals his fine work in Ryan .
I:48;1227;This film is also admirable for giving honest treatment to the role of the church in the war and for acknowledging the central place in culture that faith had in those times.
I:48;1228;I truly enjoy watching this movie multiple times per year.
I:48;1229;Lots of action with a mix of historical events.
I:48;1230;I was playing Assassin's Creed 3 and my wife said let's watch the Patriot same time period and Mel Gibson carries a tomahawk.
I:48;1231;So we bought the movie and enjoyed it
I:48;1232;I had already seen it, and I thought it was great.
I:48;1233;well, let's start off by saying it's partly true.
I:48;1234;mel Gibson plays a very powerful role.
I:48;1235;He fought in a previous war, and his experience shows on the battlefield.
I:48;1236;He has a clever mind, and it leaves you hanging to see what he'll do next.
I:48;1237;His character's view on things makes it hard to figure who's right: Gibson or Ledger.
I:48;1238;This film was historically inaccurate.
I:48;1239;the """"extended cut"""" (additional 10 minutes or so) is a real enhancement to the production."""
1240;The American Revolution has always fascinated me and The Patriot is a spectacular drama on the big screen.
1241;Having said that, The Patriot is a good action.
1242;packed adventure with some great photography.
1243;It moved from set piece to set piece without once being interesting to me or provocative.
1244;"after all, this is entertainment
I:48;1245;guys movie, done on a grand scale, you'll probably love this.
I:48;1246;The movie has *great* battle scenes, and beautiful photography, and is worth seeing.
I:48;1247;The VHS got all caught up in the machine and was destroyed.
I:48;1248;This is a really good movie with some decent history of the revolutionary war.
I:48;1249;it has some light moments and some tragic ones.
I:48;1250;however, it is quite a bit more historically accurate than """"Braveheart"""", a film to which it is often compared."""
1251;"Such voices aren't often heard in other film productions depicting this subject
I:48;1252;Besides the battle scenes themselves, which are memorable, the set designs and costumes are fantastic.
I:48;1253;Like the """"Miracle On Ice"""" story of the 1980 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament, it probably helps to be an American to gain full enjoyment of """"The Patriot""""."""
1254;"There are moments within the movie that are legitimately touching and heartfelt
I:48;1255;My opinion is that is a Hollywood production that is (somewhat) factually flawed, but a very entertaining movie otherwise.
I:48;1256;If you're an American and/or a Mel Gibson fan, you're going to really enjoy this.
I:48;1257;This was a very bloody, intense good movie.
I:48;1258;My wife thought it was one of the better films of last year.
I:48;1259;We saw this movie the same day we saw the perfect storm.
I:48;1260;This movie is much better than the Perfect storm.
I:48;1261;Lots of great action and a pretty good story.
I:48;1262;I can see why a lot of people compare this movie to Braveheart.
I:48;1263;There are a lot of similarities.
I:48;1264;The villain in this movie is top notch.
I:48;1265;The soundtrack is also quite good, music by John Williams, who has done quite a few other great films.
I:48;1266;All in all, I didn't think this movie was too long, I thought it was very entertaining.
I:48;1267;Ok, he was born in New York, I think, but has an Australian accent.
I:48;1268;Though The Patriot didn't fullfill those expectations, I was not disappointed"
1269;A British regimen comes to Martin's home and initially, they thank him for caring for his majesty's soldiers .
1270;I was hoping for a great movie that had some grounding in fact and history.
1271;I found nothing redeemable about this flick.
1272;We then exerted our awesome naval power (best in the world, thank you very much) into arresting and preventing American ships from trading for slaves with Arabs on the African coast.
1273;"Swallow your pride and leave already!What I find the most delicious thing of all is the idea that some Americans own guns ""to keep the King of England out of their face""!"
1274;The portrayal of a peace loving, patriotic, slave.
1275;But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi.
1276;Mel gibson is possibly the greatest war movie actor of all time, having two incredibly well.
1277;This one, The Patriot, surpasses Braveheart in many ways.
1278;see for any war movie fan, being both accurate and very well.
1279;The one thing that breaks this movie out of the war mold, though, is its incredible heart.
1280;The movie actually makes you feel for Mel Gibson's likeable and very intelligent character as he fights for the opportunity of retribution against his son's killer.
1281;More heart than Braveheart and more cleverness than any other war movie I've seen, this movie would make a great addtion to anyone's collection.
1282;"First of All
I:48;1283;Commentary by Director Roland Emmerich is also insightful and the 2 'Making of' featurettes are very entertaining.
I:48;1284;A good one for your collection!
I:48;1285;much more well trained and elitie than any Americans.
I:48;1286;It is my favorite movie i have ever seen it is worth every penny it is such a great film it is sad but it has lots of action at the same time.
I:48;1287;Mel Gibson does amazing in this film!
I:48;1288;And once again good triumphs over evil.
I:48;1289;Hollywood must increase British nationalism, otherwise the United States of Europe will be formed under the most corrupt undemocratic system since Rome.
I:48;1290;The US aint invinsible and its about time they realised it.
I:48;1291;Anyway the films alright fairly violent the only reason i gave it a 2 is because MEL Gibson and John Issac give a very good performance.
I:48;1292;Action scenes are good, some good effects are generated.
I:48;1293;but the sound improvements is amazing.
I:48;1294;this is a movie where a father cares for his family, alone, yet he has an extended family and his fellow countrymen and women who he can rely on.You get feeling in the movie that it is okay to fight oppression and greed and there is a time to make a stand for what is a good and proper cause.
I:48;1295;Most of our history has been oriented toward Washington, the Delaware and Philadelphia.
I:48;1296;This is a movie of the triumph of the human will to be free.
I:48;1297;This is without a doubt the MILDEST 'R' rated movie I've seen!
I:48;1298;It's very historically accurate presenting very well the Christianity and Patriotism upon which this country was founded.
I:48;1299;Roland Emmerich was an excellent choice to direct the picture!
I:48;1300;With unforgettable music, and astounding scope, and strong acting, 'The Patriot' stands as my all.
I:48;1301;star reviews stating that this is revisionist history.
I:48;1302;I found this movie to be very bothersome for many reasons which I can go into lengthy discourse about.
I:48;1303;3) The movie uses human life as a method to evoke empathy on the part of the viewer.
I:48;1304;Braveheart is a thoughtout film that does a good job of evoking humanity by not disgracing and disrespecting human life.
I:48;1305;The movie was entertaining, but I figured out what was going to happen in the first 5 minutes.
I:48;1306;Man has nice home, says he won't fight.
I:48;1307;What a bloodfest this movie was!
I:48;1308;I had been waiting for a really great film about the revolutionary war and Rolland made my wishes come true.
I:48;1309;This movie stars Mel Gibson leading men to war, but it is noteven close to Gibson's masterful Braveheart.
I:48;1310;But thanks to their courage and bravery, they are also destined to pay a pivotal role in turning the tide against the Redcoats.
I:48;1311;The cinematography is quite stunning, but some some un.
I:48;1312;wonderful movie for the Social Science classroom.
I:48;1313;Rated R by yesterday's standards, but well worth the permission slip.
I:48;1314;The studio heads seem to have attempted to bring together a group of elements from previous successes with the idea of building an Oscar.
I:48;1315;friendly movie that might just earn $100 million at the box.
I:48;1316;Well, they might not get any Oscars (except for F/X, natch), but they certainly succeeded in raking it in.
I:48;1317;They succeeded in little else.
I:48;1318;Notice how the most engaging character in the film is the FRENCH nobleman/mercenary.
I:48;1319;he's so much more interesting than Gibson's gloomy patriot .
I:48;1320;Someday a good director will make a good Revolutionary War movie.
I:48;1321;This is an epic film.
I:48;1322;One of Gibson's all time classics.
I:48;1323;Great supporting role by Heath Ledger
I:48;1324;This is an excellent film, showing the personal sacrifice involved in the American revolution.
I:48;1325;Very well casted and filmed with some very powerful music from John Williams.
I:48;1326;This is a great movie.
I:48;1327;Independence Day was fun to watch once, but that's about the most I can say about it, and Godzilla just stank.
I:48;1328;it was long, with many slow stretches, but it was otherwise entertaining and heart.
I:48;1329;wrenching, complete with an audience.
I:48;1330;Still, it's a fine piece of historical fantasy, and I'm pretty sure the costumes were authentic.
I:48;1331;I loved the score by John Williams, and the film itself was a definite improvement over the director's Godzilla or Independence Day.
I:48;1332;As I said in the title, the film is flawed, but it's great entertainmet, and if you're like me, you'll bawl your eyes out in some parts.
I:48;1333;It has tons of fun extras.
I:48;1334;i think it's worth watching a couple of times.
I:48;1335;It has some excellent performances by up.
I:48;1336;and even though I doubt Mel will win an Oscar for this one, I think his performance is worth mentioning as well.
I:48;1337;The Patriot, I believe, is the best movie ever made.
I:48;1338;It very well illustrates the American Revolution and what it was like to live in such a time.
I:48;1339;The movie is inspirational, emotional, and very dramatic which makes it such a great film.
I:48;1340;It's hard for me to sit here and describe it its so amazing!
I:48;1341;There was the most perfect acting in it and being historically accurate made it even better.
I:48;1342;Braveheart's the one that's good.
I:48;1343;There are some cool bloody scenes in it in the good old.
I:48;1344;If you expect originality, a high level of niveau, and really good drama, you are about to be disappointed.
I:48;1345;This movie is done in Hollywood.
I:48;1346;the photography is impressive and especially the first battlefield is breathtakingly pictured.
I:48;1347;the actors fill their parts, Gibson is greying but still strong and honest, the son is handsome, and his love chaste and the rest (of the American part of the cast) have endearing features, even those that are somewhat unwashed.
I:48;1348;this is a film about a war that were the start of a on the whole very positive thing, the United States, but the director seems afraid to say anything that might appear damaging to the heroes of the era.
I:48;1349;today we celebrate our independence. )
I:48;1350;If you like On Dangerous Ground (Steven Seagal) because of its realism, The Postman (Kevin Costner) for its great story and think John Wayne the greatest actor ever to have lived this is a film for you.
I:48;1351;Its quite enjoyable, I liked the subtle humor that is in it and over all it is a well told, kinda cliche, story.
I:48;1352;Wonderfully acted by Gibson, Ledger, and many others.
I:48;1353;:) Gibson played the parts of a father and a soldier very well.
I:48;1354;The Patriot is a classic and will always be a great movie, especially because it is based on true events.
I:48;1355;Mel Gibson is a fantastic actor as well.
I:48;1356;The action, the historical content and the performances are top.
I:48;1357;The characters become like family with laughter, tears, triumph and horror.
I:48;1358;This is an extremely good movie in which Mel Gibson portrays a Revolutionary War era widower, father and activist.
I:48;1359;Mel and Heath make a wonderful pair by being father and son.
I:48;1360;I reccomend this movie to anyone over the age of 13 due to the occasional graphic content during the war scenes.
I:48;1361;solid preformance by Mel and Heath.
I:48;1362;Sure it has some history problems and the timing isn't necessarily right througout the movie but it is a great diversion for a couple of hours and well worth the watch!
I:48;1363;The story is engrossing, realistic and believable.
I:48;1364;The movie is visually stunning, and the painstaking recreation of that period is evident in every frame of the film.
I:48;1365;whether the movie is historically accurate has been a subject of debate, but if you side.
I:48;1366;step this fact, the film provides a strong sense of what it must have been like to live in the 18th century, and the sacrifices that many ordinary citizens made to fight for the freedom of this country.
I:48;1367;From that perspective the title of the movie is aptly chosen and the artistic liberty that the director took in making the movie should be factored in.
I:48;1368;this movie is worth watching.
I:48;1369;The Patriot has humor, romance and action to the hilt.
I:48;1370;I watch this many times and it is always good.
I:48;1371;It was a gift for my wife!
I:48;1372;I recommend it to anyone, but especially to fathers and sons!!
I:48;1373;I love this one, probably overly cheesy and not entirely accurate but if you're looking for entertainment it's a great choice.
I:48;1374;Most of the reviewers before me have done a fine (and sometimes not so fine) job doing that already.
I:48;1375;These revisionist historians would prefer to 'Disney .
I:48;1376;there are wonderful examples why this movie is slightly above many others when it comes to the period in time it is attempting to revise.
I:48;1377;it's these sort of subtle historical gems that helps me to overlook the inaccuracies of the battle dress .
I:48;1378;one day, I hope someone does the Revolutionary War right and produces/directs the ultimate movie about the birth of our great nation.
I:48;1379;I love Revolutionary War movies.
I:48;1380;Everyone should see this movie.
I:48;1381;The film has, at best, a tenuous sense of dramatic tension.
I:48;1382;eyed enthusiasm, Have you seen this?!
I:48;1383;you can nod, smile, and walk away.
I:48;1384;If yes, you will enjoy this movie.
I:48;1385;On the surface The Patriot , directed by Roland Emmerich, was about fighting for your country and succeeding because the `lobsterbacks' are bad and we are good.
I:48;1386;The Patriot opens with a scene that inevitably becomes foreshadowing: widower Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson, star of critically acclaimed Braveheart, has just finished building a rocking chair.
I:48;1387;There's something about reenacting historic events that puts actors in """"declamatory"""" mode."""
1388;A good example of a declamatory actor is, well, Mel Gibson in Hamlet.
1389;Probably one of the better American Revolution films of the last couple decades.
1390;novelized drama and characters, the film is fairly true to the overall military action in the Carolinas.
1391;The South Carolina locations are gorgeous.
1392;The film has a 165.
1393;minute running time and is presented in wide screen.
1394;This movie is in my 'Canon of Masculinity' and is an incredible story of having principles and acting on them.
1395;It seems this movie was a mix of Braveheart, The Last of the Mohicans, and Glory all blended into one movie and set in the 1770's.
1396;One of the best movies and underated movies I ever saw (and I've seen a lot of movies).
1397;This movie takes place during the Revolutionary War from the perspective of a militia headed by Gibson.
1398;The Patriot is another example of Mel Gibson's ability to draw you into his character and make you feel a part of a great story.
1399;He never spoke of his experience and was quite content with his life as a farmer and father.
1400;He sends his children to live with his wife's sister.
1401;Gabriel takes a bride and in one of the more heart wrenching scenes a church is burned to the ground with innocent civilians inside.
1402;It truly gives a look at what these soldiers are going through and how innocent people were impacted by these events.
1403;So before Mil Gibson went crazy he did so pretty good movies this movie is one of them.
1404;It keep me entertained from beginning to end, it had great gun fights and sad deaths.
1405;Jason Issacs played the villian wonderfully, while Mel Gibson brought to life the father and soldier perfect, and who can forget the late Heath Ledger who gets a bravo for his performance.
1406;This is truly great action.
1407;I'm amazed at how many people rated this movie with a 1 star.
1408;from back then to now, this movie is still on my top 10.
1409;it is just a great movie.
1410;For a movie taken place in this time period I have to say it's one of the best.
1411;It creates a real family drama.
1412;I think it is missing a few scenes that could explain a little bit more about situations, but overally the display of warfare is very well portrayed.
1413;if you put ID4 and Braveheart (the fighting scenes) together, then you end up with The Patriot .
1414;This movie has action adventure, it's a little graphic, I'll give you that, but wow on everything else.
1415;Movies are for entertainment, to allow us all to fall into a dream, to be part of the action, to feel what it's like to be there.
1416;"I loved this movie
I:48;1417;I highly recommend this movie if you like adventure and high impact action.
I:48;1418;This epic tale of the Revolutionary War and it's effect on one man's family stars Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin with Heath Ledger as his son, Gabriel.
I:48;1419;the grand battle scenes are intertwined with intimate vignettes about the individuals in the militia: Gabriel falls in love and marries, Martin has romantic feelings for his sister.
I:48;1420;mel Gibson is wonderful as the honorable and loving father and soldier.
I:48;1421;The Patriot is a rousing tale of our early history, with excellent actors, script, and soundtrack.
I:48;1422;Mel Gibson has created some great pieces in his day, including The Patriot.
I:48;1423;The movie was based on history, yes it uses real names, but it's only to put a face of the criminal.
I:48;1424;I personally love this movie, has great dialogue and some great action scenes.
I:48;1425;They are always going to use something great and put a twist on it for it to be more appealing for everyone instead of a specific group.
I:48;1426;torn America, but it also protrayed the emotional struggles that every American had to deal with at that time.
I:48;1427;Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance.
I:48;1428;I was truly proud of his acting.
I:48;1429;This movie was the most honest and truthful work done by the motion picture industry that I have seen.
I:48;1430;In fact, it's a great emotional story, too.
I:48;1431;A very good movie, 1 of my all.
I:48;1432;a great movie love watching it with the kids.
I:48;1433;just an awesome overall film the special features are great .
I:48;1434;Came in a reasonable amount of time.
I:48;1435;This is one of the best movies of all time without a doubt!!!
I:48;1436;Mel Gibson of course is at his best in this film.
I:48;1437;His love of children is very evident.
I:48;1438;One of the most impressive scenes in the movie for me was very early in the movie, when Mel Gibson walks out on the porch and the war is right there, live and in action in your back yard.
I:48;1439;Despite what the critics might say, the film does an excellent job in showing that the Revolutionary War was in everybody's back yard.
I:48;1440;All of the actors did an excellent job to include Jason Isaac's, playing Colonel Tavington.
I:48;1441;He rather seemed to be enjoying himself in the role.
I:48;1442;The war of the 13 colonies right to freedom against the tyrants of the British Empire.
I:48;1443;I recently added this to my Blu.
I:48;1444;I've just finished watching this movie in U. s. History, and it was simply wonderful!
I:48;1445;It had a big impact on me, and gave me a deeper respect and understanding of the Revolutionary War.
I:48;1446;All off the characters and actors were incredible, and the scenery was spectacular.
I:48;1447;This story has some important messages for all us to learn, especially for those that have men and women fighting in our armed forces.
I:48;1448;award winner Mel Gibson, """"Braveheart"""", """"Pocahontas"""", """"What Women Want"""", """"Letal Weapon"""", """"Forever Young"""") leads a quiet life on his plantation with his family after serving as captain during the French and Indian War."""
1449;A few months later, he returns wounded while carrying dispatches to the Patriots.
1450;After all the blood and sweat is shed, they return home to take the children to live with Charlotte in her plantation not far from their own.
1451;"The characters, scenes, costumes, and words said in this film are so real
I:48;1452;there are plenty of scenes that are truly unforgettable, but also said, such as all of the Martins' closest family and friends and homes being destroyed by the British.
I:48;1453;It'll make you be thankful to be an American.
I:48;1454;It is here, however, that the British officer who killed Martin's son locks horns with Martin, and the lines are drawn.
I:48;1455;This sets the tenor for what is to come.
I:48;1456;there are scenes of great barbarity and pathos, which tell one that war is not just about heroism and great battles, but about personal pain and loss.
I:48;1457;The film is about love, family, honor, dishonor, tragedy, and redemption.
I:48;1458;Deftly directed by Roland Emmerich, this is a well.
I:48;1459;acted film with stirring action scenes.
I:48;1460;Mel Gibson is perfectly cast as a colonist whose life is turned upside down by the vagaries of war.
I:48;1461;The supporting cast is, likewise, excellent.
I:48;1462;I love these guys who are banging the movie because it's not historically accurate .
I:48;1463;This is a FICTIONAL character and a FICTIONAL story.
I:48;1464;the movie had excellent cinematography, costumes, and acting.
I:48;1465;it's kinda like how Elizabeth makes you all happy and googily that Elizabeth is this grand queen.
I:48;1466;i found The Patriot to be more of a tear jerker than it needed to be.
I:48;1467;At least with Braveheart (another historically inaccurate movie) Sophie gets the good ironic twist.
I:48;1468;I usually watch a movie for the entertainment just as many others do.
I:48;1469;This was a good movie, it made me mad, it made me cry, but it made me appreciate what our fore fathers did for us.
I:48;1470;a good movie at a good price.
I:48;1471;a good product at a fair price
I:48;1472;The Patiot is an amazing movie of one man and his journey from not.
I:48;1473;hard Patriot!Mel Gibson is amazing in the role and, although a very serious movie for the most part, heartwarming family scenes, pure and sweet romance, and laugh.
I:48;1474;this is a wonderful depiction of the hardships and the final triumph that came during the American War for Independence.
I:48;1475;Oh, I forgot"
1476;in short, the film does a good job, as it should do, in presenting a case study on the use of propaganda on unaware people and the danger it poses.
1477;in conclusion, the potential for a great movie was there.
1478;The message of the movie in essence is a very Patriotic one.
1479;Cast as a widower with seven children who, in spite of wanting to stay out of the war, gets totally involved as soon as it gets up close and personal, Mel Gibson's complex outstanding performance is just part of the epic sweep of this film which captured me at its very first frame and kept me weeping throughout.
1480;love, heroism, and big, bold and bloody emotion.
1481;And could there really have been such a beautiful unmarried and loving woman just waiting for Mel Gibson?
1482;Yes, it was sensationalism all the way.
1483;And history that is alive on the screen rather than just words in a book.
1484;I loved it with all its faults.
1485;i give this video my highest recommendation.
1486;It is truly the best I have seen this year.
1487;If these events depicted didn't happen EXACTLY and ENTIRELY to one group of people, you can be pretty sure that portions of them happened to others.
1488;this was actually the first Mel Gibson movie I've ever seen, and I'm glad I caught him finally!
1489;I loved him in this movie.
1490;We won and not because the colonials outnumber the English 10 to 1.
1491;Again, to those Brits out there, how dare you point fingers and acuse us!
1492;Fortunately for political correctness, Martin is evidently a Southerner who believed in freeing his slaves, and was such a saintly master that they welcome him with open arms to their island when he seeks refuge.
1493;The villian of the piece is played with teeth.
1494;the sets and costuming are excellent, and the soft focus camera work gives a nice patina, but if you're looking for something to remotely reflect the real Revolution this movie will drive you mad!
1495;Patriot proves to be a highly entertaining film but its not history, real or pretend.
1496;It sheer fantasy per Hollywood, especially when you got 20th century military warfare values inserted into 18th Century.
1497;Its make it up as you go on.
1498;He sure sugarcoated everything about the slavery issue but overall, there were enough blood, guts, humor and action to satisfied most viewers.
1499;As long as you don't learned your history form watching this movie, its strictly cartoon movie for fun and joy.
1500;Great war/history movie, I Love itIt teach so much about leadership, humanity, the spirit of the America Soldiers and the facts of war
1501;It's a throwback to the good old days of when films were good.
1502;Before people who know nothing of history dismiss the film as impossible, they should be made aware that the film is in fact based on real people and actual events.
1503;This is a good, high budget, high production movie with casts that would make Cecil B. DeMille envious.
1504;Realistic costumes, great acting, great story.
1505;It's a story of honor and revenge.
1506;fashioned saga type films they used to make like Gone With The Wind or Ben Hur this is the film for you.
1507;The Patriot is a well done movie that is both entertaining and educational.
1508;It depicts some of the struggles the colonists faced during the American revolution, very well.
1509;It's a wonderful spectacle depicting the fierce hand of the British and the gallant stand of one man who inevitably leads thousands in the final battle.
1510;Wonderful family movie, and one that should make you proud to be in the U. s. a !
1511;A very sad movie, but a great story of what the life of the colonists had to go through.
1512;Mel Gibson and his intense blue eyes are a plus.
1513;So I'll say that and a lot more.
1514;The fact is that it was a great war movie, besides that fact it was on the American Revolution.
1515;Mel Gibson made his usual appearance and did a good job as usual.
1516;At the beginning it was pretty much the same as his Brave Heart appearance.
1517;At first he was kind and loving and loved his family.
1518;But it is still pretty conventional.
1519;But, what is funny is how Mel Gibson is an animal one day, and a nice guy the next day.
1520;The special effects are pretty good, but this is a Blockbuster.
1521;I compare this film to Braveheart a lot, and I realize how good Braveheart was, and how deceiving The Patriot is.
1522;Made in USA, as they say, and proud of it.
1523;The good: As a war movie, it was very good.
1524;The battle scenes were realistic (in one ball.
1525;Also, the black people in the film are happy.
1526;This film is quite good.
1527;While most people who watch a movie like this look to the major star who plays the hero (in this case, Mel Gibson), I have found that the supporting cast makes the movie more rich and believable.
1528;Isaacs gives a stellar performance and makes you love to hate him.
1529;Gibson plays a role that seems to have been too similar to William Wallace in Braveheart, but regardless, it was a wonderful performance.
1530;all in all, I was very happy with this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Braveheart type of genre.
1531;Mel Gibson is a respectable and talented actor.
1532;But the character he played was a spitting image of William Wallace.
1533;The filming and realism is fantastic in this movies.
1534;Mr. Gibson does a great job of capturing the inner conflict of a man torn between principle and necessity.
1535;It is, after all, one man's story, a dramatization set against the backdrop of this particular conflict.
1536;That it conveys a sense of time, place and importance is what matters, and that it does.
1537;Film that is at once both intimate and of epic proportions.
1538;"It is artistically rendered, beautifully photographed, and well acted
I:48;1539;So go see it today.
I:48;1540;but you gotta admit the similarities are startling: Mel Gibson = Jesus.
I:48;1541;Excellent cast and the special I a l effects are outstanding!
I:48;1542;I would love this movie in black.
I:48;1543;One of the very few movies that Mel Gibson was involved in that deserves a special kind of respect.
I:48;1544;ray, I would highly recommend this one.
I:48;1545;What I found was a very well produced and directed movie with good acting by all.
I:48;1546;It was a delight on an entertainment level as well as a patriotic one.
I:48;1547;This is also a dramatic way to remind us of our roots.
I:48;1548;It's rekindled an interest in the Revolutionary War for me and my family.
I:48;1549;This is an outstanding film of the revolutionary period.
I:48;1550;Mel Gibson is an outstanding actor.
I:48;1551;i reserve the right to recant that if things change "
1552;i was very much enchanted by the quiet grace that joely richardson conveyed in her acting.
1553;the length of the movie is fine.
1554;the directing was very good and the cinematography at times was exceptional.
1555;epic story, *the patriot* may be of interest.
1556;Received the product within a couple of days of order, and it worked very well.
1557;This is a great movie.
1558;The scenes of battle leave you feeling such great admiration for these simple people who could have taken the easy road, but instead took the hard road even though they knew that for many of them it would lead to death.
1559;the acting in this film (all the actors) is wonderful, you feel as though you are watching the real thing and not just a recreation of the past.
1560;wrenching scenes that won't soon leave your heart, and there are cinematic scenes that are stunning.
1561;This is a GREAT movie that I will watch more than once and it has earned keeper status on my shelf.
1562;The Patriot is excellent, a must see for all you warriors out there.
1563;It is a vivid recounting of the era of the Revolution.
1564;Mel Gibson is as good as always.
1565;The costumes and the pageantry of the movie are excellent and the battle scenes very well done.
1566;All in all a very high level of realism.
1567;I greatly enjoyed this film.
1568;It was the best Revolutionary War film to come out since all the outpouring of media on that era during the time of the Bicentennial in 1976.
1569;This is an excelent movie.
1570;This was an overall good movie, but not the best.
1571;If you want a movie with surprising twists and turns this isn't the movie for you, for everyone else, this is a good movie to see.
1572;Come on Mel, those Limeys should face up to the truth.
1573;"evident:That all men are created equal
I:48;1574;the thirteen colonies emerged an infant nation.
I:48;1575;He bravely leads bands of enlisted men into battle, through victory and defeat, often outnumbered, in the struggle to win the independence of the states.
I:48;1576;(The filmmakers really strayed from history here, since Cornwallis was, by all accounts, a highly intelligent strategist, and may have been England's most capable commander in North America.)
I:48;1577;Colonel Tavington is himself based on real.
I:48;1578;but the film does get other things right as well.
I:48;1579;If that included your back or front yard, so be it.
I:48;1580;utilized guerilla warfare techniques, finding them to be their most useful defense strategy.
I:48;1581;The British, not unlike previous empires, had an affinity for using fire: they burned houses, barns, supply stores, and yes, even churches .
I:48;1582;But it is Tom Wilkinson who puts in the best overall performance, as the General Lord Cornwallis.
I:48;1583;Nobody at the time really had a great sense of freedom.
I:48;1584;Elsewhere, the Frenchman tells a slave.
I:48;1585;Instead, it would have looked better to drop the statement and show a bit more of the slave's struggle to acquire that freedom, amidst the ungrateful boos of racists.
I:48;1586;Just before he is decisively stabbed, he inexplicably summons the strength (and knowledge?)
I:48;1587;It is, in fact, quite good.
I:48;1588;Most of it is serious and very entertaining, and we can be thankful Roland Emmerich didn't repeat his earlier mistake (""""Independence Day"""")."""
1589;Visually, it ranks with Gladiator as one of the great movies of 2000.
1590;Their primary purpose is to entertain.
1591;My suggestion is that the viewer enjoy its epic story and remember that it is just a well told tall tale, just a lavishly produced fable.
1592;He is now a farmer in South Carolina.
1593;the visuals truly are impressive.
1594;The battle scenes are immense in size, very well choreographed and intensely dramatic.
1595;The many costumes are elaborate and colorful.
1596;The photography has especially vibrant hues.
1597;Having lived in the area of South Carolina where many of the exteriors were filmed, I have to add that it is one of the most beautiful areas in the country.
1598;Still, he is apt to become a star in his own right.
1599;There is one remarkable performance, that of Jason Issacs as Col. William Tavington, a British officer, Martin's nemesis, and one of the best villains of late.
1600;the Patriot is moviemaking on the grand scale, and if you can disregard its historical mistruths, it can be grandly entertaining.
1601;brit feel, AND it runs way too long at over two hours, I can't help but love to watch this movie!
1602;It is one of the best depictions of the Revolutionary War era in recent times and I find the many horrifically realistic battle scenes fascinatingly re.
1603;And I love that tomahawk!
1604;telling of an American legend, church burnings, free slaves , and Green Dragoon coats aside, you can't help but love the scene where Martin dupes British General Lord Cornwallis out of hanging his militiamen or the over.
1605;top confrontation between Martin and dashing but villianous Colonel Tavington.
1606;There have been so many things said about the basis for Ben Martin (real.
1607;life South Carolina patriot Francis Marion) and Tavington that I found it amusing to read some of the comments below.
1608;That is the wonder of history!
1609;If nothing else, I hope that this movie will at least inspire an interest in a great period of history and perhaps lead to even more enjoyable and accurate Revolutionary War movies.
1610;I think that the movie does a great job in showing the reality of the American Revolution.
1611;"It wasn't a war that we won easily
I:48;1612;One of my favorite scenes in the film was an overview of a battlefield.
I:48;1613;All in all, this was a very good movie and I would strongly recommend it.
I:48;1614;This movie was filled with emotion, drama, action, and was a good historical lesson.
I:48;1615;The drama in this movie was very powerful and the action scenes were very intense.
I:48;1616;All in all, it's not as powerful as Saving Private Ryan, but it's a wonderful take on the Revolutionary War.
I:48;1617;This is a really good movie.
I:48;1618;the cinema release was crisp and sharp and clear.
I:48;1619;For one it is entertaining, I like Mel Gibson and the other actors as well and IMHO believe they did a fine job of acting.
I:48;1620;Jason Isaacs in particular did a fine job.
I:48;1621;and it is my hope that the film will spur people to pick up a book about this part of the Rev War.
I:48;1622;There are many, excellent books about it.
I:48;1623;Mel Gibson does a nice job as a man amidst the Revolutionary War.
I:48;1624;I laughed at this and thought it was great, it showed that research had been done.
I:48;1625;The story itself is riveting with quite a few emotional scenes and some sadness, so be ready to have your heartstrings tugged at.
I:48;1626;The camerawork and action scenes are also nicely executed, so two thumbs up!
I:48;1627;I was deeply moved by this film.
I:48;1628;It was so powerful that you almost felt like you were there.
I:48;1629;It is without a doubt the best movie about the Revolutionary War that I have ever seen.
I:48;1630;But I have to be in the right mood for him.
I:48;1631;He has particpated previously in battles, and is now a proud family man, trying to keep his children out of danger.
I:48;1632;But his eldest son, played by a blonde Heath, is determined to serve his country, and goes out fighting.
I:48;1633;It was one of those films that yes was good, but could have been edited slightly better towards the end.
I:48;1634;I totally love this movie!
I:48;1635;It's not only a great war movie, it also does a great job of showing how the war affect all of the families of the men fighting against the British.
I:48;1636;This was a spectacular movie.
I:48;1637;And the thing I liked about it.
I:48;1638;they were there to write a damn good movie, and that's it.
I:48;1639;I'll risk getting raised eyebrows from fellow cinephiles and history buffs, but """"The Patriot"""" is one of my favorite films."""
1640;It's a film that could have been a brilliant, go.
1641;the story of a South Carolinian family during the infamously violent and vicious Southern campaign of the American Revolution, the film is the saga of the Martin family caught in the midst of a historical shift.
1642;This is what the film does masterfully, it renders an image of savage violence and atrocity inflicted upon a colonial population and how it affected the individuals involved.
1643;the fact that they kill off as many characters as they do is risky, but true to the brutality and unpredictability of life and history, and gives the film the air of a true tragedy because of how much we become attached to these people (which is one reason why I have a problem with the ending).
1644;At least we get Jason Isaac's riveting and seductive performance as Tavington.
1645;the drama of the film, where it may contain some stock scenarios, mediocre dialogue and characters, is equally witty, poignant, and effective thanks to the acting and directing.
1646;"There are many moments where the camera finds the perfect place to watch Gabriel, without an ounce of treacle, wave goodbye to his fiancee (Heath Ledger turns in a lovely, sensitive, and entirely convincing performance as a young revolutionary/big brother but without acting like a starched shirt collar)
I:48;1647;It's moments like these that create utterly normal, real people in the midst of turmoil.
I:48;1648;It recreates the feel of the time so tangibly, it picks you up and plunks you right into the middle of a humid, violent place where tensions are heightened and you're constantly looking over your back to see if your family is safe, to check your loyalties.
I:48;1649;you get to know a lot of the characters on a very personal level and we begin to understand the fine lines between freedom and loyalty, taking risks or managing the threat, priorities and principles.
I:48;1650;When Benjamin doesn't want to support a war because of his family or see his sons go to fight you feel how desperate he is,but you also understand Gabriel's youthful idealism and urgency and his love for his wife (although she's fairly annoying) and his cause.
I:48;1651;the film is probably one of the best looking films out there, with stunning cinematography showcasing gorgeous Spanish moss, multicolored skies, mist, twilight, swamps.
I:48;1652;use the natural landscape and the period as a living part of the film's setting and just pulls us into it, help create that world, and serve to enhance much of the dramatic material.
I:48;1653;although """"The Patriot"""" isn't as masterful as it easily could have been, it's still a film worth seeing for everything it does well, which is a lot."""
1654;Despite problems, this is how history should be treated, as a vivid, emotional, palpable story .
1655;about people that is as thrilling and gut.
1656;shedding a tear or two .
1657;GIBSON is clearly working for his paychech here.
1658;All the while, beautiful classic music is playing as soundtrack.
1659;As we know, being slayed by a hammer, an axe or a sword must be a delightful experience .
1660;WHy BRAVEHEART is so better ?
1661;Because they started as good.
1662;ray version of The Patriot, I knew I had to write my first review.
1663;ray for the first time last weekend and I'm happy to report it is awesome.
1664;in the first sequence of the film I noticed a great variety and range between the various colors.
1665;and then there's the fun of the added scenes, or parts of scenes, in the Extended Cut.
1666;The added shots of the one surviving red.
1667;coat after Benjamin Martin's rampage to free his eldest son (the introduction of The Ghost motif) are also great.
1668;summing up, I think all huge fans of this film who have a Blu.
1669;This is a popcorn movie.
1670;But let's face it, you came in to Mel Gibson in full Braveheart mode fighting for the good ol' USA.
1671;When the revolution breaks out, his military expertise is called upon to help win the day.
1672;The rest you can pretty well guess.
1673;some good performances and well choreographed battle scenes make this a decent movie.
1674;This is one of my favorite historical action/adventure flicks of all time!
1675;(As long as the basic look is right, then I'm happy!)
1676;It's got revenge, it's got a recluctant, guilt ridden hero, it's got a great tomahowk and knife versus (several) bayonets fight (my favorite scene, 'cause it looks like Mel Gibson is doing a frontier colonial American's version of martial.
1677;, a pretty love interest who's nice, lovable, and not much else, a ruthless villain, and real.
1678;life historical figures interacting with the fictional leads.
1679;But it's an action movie, so that's what we want!
1680;(I especially laughed at the fact that all the British were snobs!
1681;I went into this movie with high expectations, very high, maybe too high.
1682;Visually stunning, nice special effects, some excellent combat scenes, cannot over come the movies major shortcomings.
1683;He is becoming such a one dimensional actor/director.
1684;If you love Mel you'll probably love this movie, if you love fantasy's you'll probably love this movie.
1685;Once again, people crave for authenticity.
1686;and once again, I say, It's a movie.
1687;I like escapism, and movies that move me.
1688;"It's beautifully filmed by the respected Caleb Deschanel
I:48;1689;Mel Gibson has been labeled an okay actor, but if you look deep inside his performances, the man does his best in filling whatever shoes his role dictates.
I:48;1690;Heath Ledger is all gungho and spirited as Gabriel, and plays well with the rest of his cast.
I:48;1691;Tom Wilkinson is superb as Cornwallis, a man steeped in tradition and British fanfare.
I:48;1692;His scene with Gibson in which the patriot negotiates for the release of his 18 prisoners is exceptional.
I:48;1693;how else would it work, but it's to director Roland Emmerich's credit, that when the credits were over, I felt moved and touched.
I:48;1694;ray makes it even better.
I:48;1695;ish romantic subplots that mark the rest of the film.
I:48;1696;Pay attention and you'll see scenes ripped off from Star Wars, Aliens, and more.
I:48;1697;I must admit that this is one aspect of the film that I found most unsettling.
I:48;1698;that said, the film has some good points.
I:48;1699;There are some effective performances.
I:48;1700;The film has outstanding production values (it picked up Oscar nominations for cinematography, sound, and score).
I:48;1701;Give The Patriot a try, but watch it with a critical eye.
I:48;1702;This is a movie I guarantee you will embrace.
I:48;1703;It is a civil war tale of epic proportions.
I:48;1704;The cinematography and music are breathtaking.
I:48;1705;I believe that a film can never achieve excellence without first establishing a conflict, for conflict you need a villan and the Patriot offers an antagonist you love to hate.
I:48;1706;The scenery and fighting scenes superb.
I:48;1707;This film is quite entertaining, and you will not believe how fast the time goes by, but this story has been told before.
I:48;1708;It pulls your heartstrings and also makes you stand up and cheer.
I:48;1709;It features family taken from Mel, and Mel's revenge.
I:48;1710;The film does a nice job of showing just how much damage a lead ball can do to a human being.
I:48;1711;I am a fan of Mel Gibson's work, and based on that, it is a film I recommend adding to your collection.
I:48;1712;The supporting cast is spectacular, and really make this an enjoyable movie.
I:48;1713;As far as war pictures go, Hollywood has, until this picture, pretty much been unable to capture the Revolutionary War in the emotional tempo that is necessary to make a battle movie decent.
I:48;1714;While The Patriot really isn't as good as any of those three, it is still quite the entertaining motion picture.
I:48;1715;com seem to do a good enough job of that for you.
I:48;1716;This movie is well acted by all parts, especially Gibson.
I:48;1717;As you watch this film you will feel the familiarity of watching Braveheart, and for good reason.
I:48;1718;The difference this time around is the connection you will feel as an American.
I:48;1719;the biggest compliment I can give this film is not any I can type in here, but that I've ordered it, and from the looks of it, I've ordered it even before they've posted any special features.
I:48;1720;Four stars out of five is pretty good in my book, and I'm pretty sure that most people out there will enjoy this movie once they see it.
I:48;1721;While The Patriot is entertaining, there are some historical inaccuracies:1.
I:48;1722;In my humble opinion, I thought at least the acting was good.
I:48;1723;It's one of Mel Gibson's best.
I:48;1724;So they recruit local men to help them fight and they become queit formidable.
I:48;1725;This is the best American Revolution movie I have ever seen, although it is not a true story.
I:48;1726;that is, Americans of European heritage having become pitted against their own kinsmen from afar in order to form """"A more perfect union"""" on our shores."""
1727;This is an outstanding movie, and I hope that it becomes more popular as a representation of American history as much as thrilling and compelling drama.
1728;magnificent as a piece of cinema, but a disgraceful mangling of the real story of my country's greatest hero.
1729;The Patriot has stunning battle sequences that show war in its full horrific reality, but displays a stunning lack of historical accuracy and moral courage.
1730;it's this hypocritical glossing over of historical fact that ultimately sinks The Patriot , and that's a shame, because the film has many strengths, including its depiction of the brutality of combat, marvelous period feel and set design, and a very strong performance by Mel Gibson.

1735;Both Gibson and Karyo provide some good comedy relief within a war which is never fun.
1736;all in all this is a great war movie that makes for an interesting view during the time period when some colonists insisted on breaking from the mother country: Britain.
1737;"It's a great movie set in a time period that I love the most
I:48;1738;I see it for what it is: A movie!
I:48;1739;This is history written through the lens of late 20th century values.
I:48;1740;em up movie it's fine.
I:48;1741;The Patriot, starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Chris Cooper, Jason Isaacs, and Tom Wilkinson, is a film that's well acted and sumptuously produced, although not particularly historically accurate.
I:48;1742;i enjoyed every aspect of this superb film.
I:48;1743;Mel Gibson turns in another characteristically fine performance as Colonel Benjamin Martin.
I:48;1744;Gibson portrays the movie's protagonist as a man of contradictions: gentle with his children, yet possessed with an almost demonic violent streak"
1745;pounding action abounds in The Patriot.
1746;Battle scenes are well choreographed and employ just the right amount of bloody realism, without succumbing to gratuitous sanguinary violence.
1747;shattering event resulting in a deep personal loss is capable of changing the protagonist's mind about fighting the enemy of his people.
1748;I would have liked to see The Patriot's screen writers rely a bit more on an original story line.
1749;for lovers of great action movies and fans of Mel Gibson: don't miss The Patriot!
1750;rate entertainment all the way!
1751;My all time favorite movie will always be Braveheart but I think this film is top notch and a long time in coming.
1752;I hope this movie sparks interest in American History much like Braveheart did for Scotland, respectively.
1753;Its a very good, well made film and certainly worth adding to your video collection.
1754;This movie is a great one, and you will like it even more if you are interested in the historic time period in which it takes place.

1762;mY REVIEW: An excellent motion picture!
1763;The film is filled with emotional epic warfare drama!
1764;A great movie for all fans of wonderful movies!
1765;The Patriot is really good and exciting fun.
1766;mel Gibson and Heath Ledger deliver great performances in this roller coaster ride through the American Revolution.
1767;The cinematography is beautiful, the battle scenes believable and thrilling and the story is good (if fantasy) fun.
1768;that said, here are the strengths: Mel Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Tom Wilkinson (as Gen. Cornwallis), and Heath Ledger play their parts very well.
1769;The battle sequences are stunning, and the cinematography is lush and sometimes even symbolic.
1770;the foremost saving grace of this film, I think, is the score by famed musical raconteur John Williams.
1771;His ability to tell a tale through music hasn't faded, and the score is good enough to fall in love with.
1772;Not exactly original, but still entertaining.
1773;For example, Benjamin Martin's (Mel Gibson) character, an ex.
1774;if you can watch a movie without being overly critical of it's failure to breech the chasm of fact and fiction, and can simply enjoy the movie for it's entertainment value, then you will love this movie.
1775;costumes were great, battle scenes, all the visually appealing stuff was.
1776;Yet, the best part of the movie for me, were the supporting characters.
1777;Chris Cooper was excellent as Col. Burwell, and personified American leadership at that time.
1778;But, overall, a good film about the Revolution that will hopefully spurn more
1779;If you want entertainment from war, well, enjoy the vicarious brutal thrills over and over by purchasing it.
1780;good version of American history.
1781;What lofty goals to set and fulfill for one film.
1782;A good film should answer the question it raises.
1783;This was a common practice with both armies and even existed during our Civil War.
1784;i truly dislike how the British were portrayed in the film.
1785;Burning the church full of innocent people was done for sheer shock value.
1786;If anyone else has documented an incident similar to the church burning, please post it.
1787;I just hope that this brings more popularity into filming Revolutionary era films.
1788;Films are good to see in their context.
1789;Visual displays can help to realize what things looked like.
1790;It has to be worked on to make coherence, a good plot line, and handle certain time constraints.
1791;Good luck and enjoy The Patriot for what it is.
1792;I love period pieces for their use of characters, design, plot, and story arcs especially when done right it can convey and provoke emotions about certain events as well as individuals that may or may not have ever existed in the first place.
1793;All actors give strong convincing performances as well.
1794;This is one Mel's many great performances a great film to watch.
1795;the patriot is ,if not always true to history, a very fine film about the american revolution.
1796;"this is a very bloody film and not for the kids but like ""saving private ryan"" written by the same man it takes a vast story and brings it into a small group of people and lets you feel what they feel."
1797;not many movies are made about this war so it's nice to see this fine film .
1798;I highly recommend this movie.
1799;Despite the weight of these opinions, I still stand by mine, which is that the Patriot is an entertaining, thought.
1800;Many scenes riveted me in suspense or despair, such as when the children are hiding in the aunt's house and the heartbreaking burning of the church.
1801;Also, I appreciated the family aspect of the movie, especially the character of the young daughter, Susan.
1802;It also sparked my family's curiousity in the Revolutionary war.
1803;My final word: This film will prove itself engaging, if you just let yourself be engaged.
1804;Best movie great for whole family love it!
1805;so mission doubly accomplished there Mel.
1806;and yes I take great offence.
1807;to the cute and pure portrayal of the slave keeper.
1808;Sublime racism of this sort that basically says blacks have been far luckier than they like to tell, and 'good' people recognised their worth.
1809;I have one morsel of comfort with regard to this film.
1810;because by our example and our history Great Britain as a whole and England certainly has more than earned the right to expect better.
1811;This film is shallowness itself.
1812;take a measure of historical inaccuracy, add some banner waving, a touch of over.
1813;if you want originality, look elsewhere.
1814;candy, this is for you.
1815;I saw The Patriot for the first time yesterday and it is really an awesome movie that moves you on the inside!!
1816;The violent battle scenes were very realistic!
1817;I highly recommend this movie to all history buffs out there!
1818;the movie does our feeling and thinking for us.
1819;This is a very good film, And if you like mel this a must have.
1820;there are some very good acting in the movie.
1821;that's right, Mel Gibson, minus the blue face paint.
1822;The cinematography is rich and adds immensely to this movie.
1823;The film is exceedingly long and drawn out.
1824;fests, which may have improved it substantially.
1825;This is truly one the best films ever made.
1826;I loved every aspect of it and the final battle was not only brilliant, it was based on an actual battle that took place and is known as the Battle of Cowpens .
1827;I highly recommend this film to anyone that has been pining for a truly great film based on the American Revolution.
1828;This is a must for Mel Gibson fans.
1829;As a Scot i loved Braveheart and there are obvious parallels between the two movies.
1830;For this reason i love this film.
1831;John Paul Jones was from Scotland and fought the British as well as create the American Navy.
1832;america and Scotland are two of the few countries in the world that managed to defeat England/Britain and i think thats something to be proud of, especially as England had the worlds greatest army and navy and ruled the known world.
1833;When I first learned about the Revolutionary War in middle school, the history textbooks romantisized it and presented this conflict as a glorious fight for freedom on a sunny battlefield.
1834;And this film shows it.
1835;It would have helped the film a great deal if we could see in him the same inner struggles that we see in Martin.
1836;But despite of its shortcomings, this movie is definitely worthy of being seen.
1837;the battle scenes are stirring, the music score by John Williams is passionate and vehement, and the acting by Mel Gibson is impeccable.
1838;Mel Gibson does a good job and about five minutes in he is Benjamin Martin not Martin Riggs.
1839;the Blood is up and everyone is up for War.
1840;The rest of the movie showes how true that is.
1841;There is hard sad times but in the end it is a feel good movie.
1842;The U. s. Revolution is made to look like a one.
1843;Consider, for example, Gibson's hit.
1844;This movie is a must see!
1845;It has all the factors which determine if you like the movie!
1846;The roles are played greatly by Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger and all the other gret supporting actors.
1847;This movie is based upon the civil war and has a good storyline to go along with its actors and actresses.
1848;I cried three times because It was so inspiring!
1849;Thanks for listening and I hope you will enjoy the movie as much as I.
1850;For really a first time try, the Revolutionary War movieThe Patriot was pretty good.
1851;Marian and his men played a major role in South Carolina Revolutionary War.
1852;There are a few other things that I'll point out.
1853;There was one seen were the patriots capture a British supply wagon.
1854;The last thing that I will bring up is the seen were Tavington burned the town church with people inside it.
1855;I thought the last battle seen was well done.
1856;This is a terrific movie that captivates with the energy and drive portrayed by the characters .
1857;a rare movie that links experiences with personality and passion.
1858;Highly nerve wracking, gory but very moving and dramatic.
1859;It's amazing how a few additional minutes added to a film can really add to the context and enhance the story.
1860;The Extended version of The Patriot only adds a few minuets of time to the movie, but enhanced the story significantly.
1861;Others have already pointed out the scenes and the impact, but I can vouch for their accuracy.
1862;If you enjoyed the original, you'll love the new version even more.
1863;As a history buff, I appreciate the attention to detail employed by the filmmaker.
1864;perhaps then you will be swept up in the filmmakers' enthusiasm for their project.
1865;Only Chris Cooper and Tom Wilkinson manage to turn in performance that strike realistic chords, rising above cliche.
1866;The cinematography and special effects, however, are top notch.
1867;Still, if the genre appeals to you it will bring you viewing pleasure.
1868;Personally, I'd prefer a good documentary on the Revolutionary War.
1869;I have always liked this movie n decided to add it to my collection.
1870;Inaccuries are abundant in this flick.
1871;I was excited at the prospect of a Revolutionary War Film.
1872;if you know nothing of history, this film is great.
1873;The kids do a far better job acting than do some of the veterans.
1874;And why is the villain the most intriguing character in this movie?
1875;here's a sum up of all the faux.
1876;(At least they got that right)*British Uniform Colours: Red.
1877;Mel Gibson has again done something that we have come to expect of him everytime.
1878;The movie has some beautiful scene settings and near perfect action sequences.
1879;Mel Gibson's style of fighting in the movie reminded me of the scenes in The Last of The Mohicans.
1880;Roland Emmerich has created a masterpiece.
1881;Amazing acting by all, beautiful cinematography and a moving script.
1882;"This film, THE PATRIOT, by director Roland Emmerich, is a fair example of your average Hollywood movie
I:48;1883;Mr. gibson slaughters plenty of englishmen again.
I:48;1884;All I can say is, thank you Mr. gibson.
I:48;1885;Other wise the action satisfies any testostorome pumped male.
I:48;1886;The cinemetography is above average.
I:48;1887;all those who belong to former english colonies, may enjoy some of the bashing.
I:48;1888;Now, I just enjoy the action and drama.
I:48;1889;There are literally thousands of excellent books and documentaries about the struggle for America's freedom.
I:48;1890;If I want to learn something, I can turn to them.
I:48;1891;If I want entertainment, I will watch Hollywood movies.
I:48;1892;While this is not a strictly historical account of the revolutionary war, I feel that it does everything and more to represent this time in our national history that Saving Private Ryan does for the WWII era.
I:48;1893;I have seen this production twice in the theater, and would see it again if it were still here in my town.
I:48;1894;It would've been considered the most inspirational film of all time, a masterpiece.
I:48;1895;The Patriot is, to me, anyway, a fantastic historical action/drama, and even though it has its sappy, melodramatic scenes, it's still very enjoyable and entertaining.
I:48;1896;Mel Gibson is pretty cool, as usual, and his character is actually kinda deep (for an action movie, anyway).
I:48;1897;the battle scenes in the film are awesome.
I:48;1898;The costumes look great (though rather inaccurate), and every combat scene is thrilling and well.
I:48;1899;The final battle, in particular, is very exciting.
I:48;1900;the music in the film, composed by the legendary John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) is one of my favorite things about the film.
I:48;1901;The score is so epic.
I:48;1902;It's incredible, there's nothing more to say, it pretty much makes the film.
I:48;1903;I choose B. while certainly not perfect, The Patriot is a very enjoyable film with great action, great music, and great direction (yes, for the first time ever, I liked Roland Emmrich's direction).
I:48;1904;I recommend watching it at least once.
I:48;1905;Possibly the best movie of Mel's.
I:48;1906;the great, as always,Mel Gibson gives a tremendous performance in this movie showing how much of a patriot a man can be and promotes also the ideas of sensitivity and thoughtfulness.
I:48;1907;In some scenes he seems so real in his actions and expressions that anyone would bet that this is a real documentary!!
I:48;1908;He is devoted to his work and unique in his acting ability!
I:48;1909;Recommended undoubtedly to every movie fan!
I:48;1910;Shun this film like the plague!
I:48;1911;It doesn't matter too much to me if it is not correct, I just enjoy an excellent movie.
I:48;1912;The Patriot is an excellent movie because of its perfect storyline, flawless acting, and authentic uniforms.
I:48;1913;the story starts with Benjamin Martin and his family at their house in South Carolina.
I:48;1914;He begins a guerrilla war with great effectivness.
I:48;1915;The story heads out from there and can get very sad at points, but it is definately well written.
I:48;1916;the acting done by Mel Gibson (Benjamin Martin), Gabriel Martin (Heath Ledger), and many others is absolutely flawless.
I:48;1917;They say their lines in a very convincing way.
I:48;1918;the detail made to the uniforms and weapons is fantastic.
I:48;1919;The British uniforms are well detailed along with the muskets.
I:48;1920;The Colonials uniforms are also highly detailed and look authentic.
I:48;1921;All the buildings are perfect for the time because they used real plantations and houses.
I:48;1922;It is a great movie even if it is historically incorrect.
I:48;1923;The Patriot has all the parts necessary for a wonderful film.
I:48;1924;When i have seen the teaser i said wow another Braveheart kinda movie .
I:48;1925;Than i ve seen the trailer and i said i gotta see that one it will be a classic .
I:48;1926;I rated two stars because i have a great amount of respect to Gibson and Emmerich's old works (excluding Godzilla).
I:48;1927;this movie is purely cinematic.
I:48;1928;Besides the action, the movie does manage to touch the emotional conflicts of the period in a truthful way (i. e. Gibson's young sons having to fight, and then taking a semi.
I:48;1929;personally, I liked the cinematography of the movie the best.
I:48;1930;dawn battles to the old mission in the swamp, it is all visually pleasing, though, it is clear where the digitial effects came in handy.
I:48;1931;overall, if you are willing to dismiss the historical flaws, which most of us do anyways, you will enjoy this movie.
I:48;1932;This was a great movie, Mel Gibson is a great actor
I:48;1933;This is one of Mel Gibson's best.
I:48;1934;It is also a treat to see a young Heath Ledger who was an amazing acting talent.
I:48;1935;This historical fiction gives great insight into what the founders of America risked and sacraficed to establish this new nation.
I:48;1936;Leaving the story line to those who like to write, this is an excellent Blu.
I:48;1937;Great picture and sound, features as advertised.
I:48;1938;Highly recommend seeing, very entertaining.
I:48;1939;the Patriot is pretty darn O. k.
I:48;1940;It has everything"
1941;Will you listen to the wisdom of one who has been there or take the energy and inexperience of those going for glory?
1942;The director, Roland Emmerich, manages to comment on these issues.
1943;I hope this has been a help.
1944;It is a great movie.
1945;He is one of the best actors today and will always be.
1946;This is a great story about love of one's family and country.
1947;The big guys don't always win.
1948;He loves it and will be recommending it to his friends.
1949;I'm sure I will watch it again.
1950;I have just seen The Patriot and i think it is one of the best films about the revolutionary war ever made.
1951;As I said, this is entertaining, and that is all it was intended to be.
1952;He is a great actor!
1953;The Patriot is one of his best.
1954;Worth watching over and over.
1955;It has great video and audio transfer.
1956;This was a good movie.
1957;(as learned by a British Lt.) It is a spectacle in an era when spectacles of this type are frowned upon.
1958;It is a good choice to see since the attack, you will even get a few laughs from the rocking chair sequences.
1959;(Very Funny)If you want to see a MOVIE with black white and just a few shades of grey see this one.
1960;Gibson did a much better job as the lonely hero in other movies and I'm not sure he has done a really good move since Road Warrior , almost twenty years ago.
1961;the special effects are great.
1962;The battle scenes are well.
1963;A better work from this period, although just as bloody, is Last of the Mohicans .
1964;This film is a major improvement over earlier films that deal with the Revolution, but it still could have been better.
1965;Students of uniforms and period weaponry will notice quite a few inaccuracies.
1966;Showed it to my 8th grade history class.
1967;Great asset to my class!
1968;I thoroughly enjoyed this fast moving film.
1969;I've watched this movie several times and still notice things I didn't see before, great movie.
1970;Mel Gibson delivers great performances in his movies.
1971;Mel Gibson's portrayal was, as always, great.
1972;He makes this movie a good one.
1973;There were some very nice visual spots in the movie, e. g. Charleston.
1974;So, hats off to Mel for another great job of acting.
1975;This movie is flawless and has an important message for our time.
1976;be sure to watch it with the entire family.
1977;I love It I will have See It Again
1978;It is an excellent video for the family and it's beautiful.
1979;This movie tells it as it was.
1980;Go to the movie because you want to see Mel or any of the other fine actors and the scenery and clothes.
1981;It showed har far you can go with the courage of your convictions.
1982;Find a comfy chair, pop some corn and enjoy the ride, big Mel doesn't disappoint.
1983;This disc has enhanced region 1 coding which means it will NOT play on most multi.
1984;This is very good movie.
1985;moving, and rigid) regular armies, as long as the guerrillas have wide support in the countryside.
1986;will so alienate the people that they will throw in behind the insurgents, making the triumph of the freedom.
1987;the acting is good, the human element (though brief) is moving, the scenery is spectacular.
1988;But some effort has been made to include important female roles.
1989;I really enjoy watching this movie and now it is on BD it is truly a vision of splendor.
1990;The clarity and sharpness makes the picture gorgeous to look at.
1991;The audio transfer is also extremely good.
1992;overall this BD title is just brilliant and definitely top tier 1 level.
1993;Classic Mel Gibson, very well done.
1994;Although many of the characters are fictional the story line is well written.
1995;It is therefore perfectly possible that an individual farmer might prefer free labor to slave and be able to find and hire such.
1996;Made just before ol'Mel went on his infamous tirade, this film is a classic.
1997;the movie is true to the history of the conflict and bitingly critical of the red coat occupiers.
1998;The cinematics are at times breath taking!
1999;Whether you like Gibson or not, this movie is worth a view.
2000;I found the Patriot to paint a good picture of what the Revolutionary War could have been like for a number of American families.
2001;I think this movie is worth your time.
2002;From the Prison ship Jersey to the summary execution of pastors in the Black Regiment the spirit of this film captures what the Colonists were up against.
2003;As historical drama, this is a top notch film which adds to the corpus of period warfare films.
2004;Put this one on the shelf with Braveheart, Last of the Mohicans, Gettysburg, and Glory.
2005;Those who know and love America and the Cause of Liberty, will be moved to tears by the powerful imagery of this truly great movie.
2006;"all of my relatives survived the war and enjoyed their new ""Freedom""."
2007;This is a great film, right up there with Braveheart.
2008;The colours are vibrant and beautiful, as is the sound!
2009;there are so many other excellent movies about the Revolutionary Wars out there.
2010;Yet another superb remastered classic, with superb high definition picture and unbelievable sound.
2011;This is a superb film, directors cut and as usual you have to wonder why they cut some of the more important scenes.
2012;The product arrived in very good condition and it arrived in a very short period of time.
2013;now we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British (as well as others) .
2014;but i wouldn't ever call it the best movie of the summer.
2015;a lot of movies are historically inaccurate.
2016;i want something more realistic!
2017;ray disc, I bought it on Amazon.
2018;Just please tell us in the review.
2019;To be perfectly frank, i loved this movie.
2020;the dialouge was clever, the acting well done(especially on Susan's part), the music moving to the point of tears, and the camera work spectacular.
2021;I loved the story, and even though some may say it was all about revenge,wasn't accurate,etc. etc.,however,I think the central theme was wonderful.
2022;This movie takes that and rubs it in our faces.
2023;See this movie, you won't regret it.
2024;The Patriot is such a great movie.
2025;It really portrays what live was like during the American Revolution.
2026;A must see for the whole world.
2027;a breathtakingly well made, acted,& true.
2028;The death of a loved one by an Englishman, the revenge, the capture, the escape, a bit of cunning, a lot of bloodshed and, oh yes, Gibson manages to win the war.
2029;"it is sad that the comparison comes so easily, because in it's own right THE PATRIOT is a passable movie
I:48;2030;a. baby characterization of the protaganist and action lovers will thrill at the excellent battle scenes.
I:48;2031;This is a family movie thats adventurous.
I:48;2032;rays, this is my favorite.
I:48;2033;I admire Randall Wallace's writing.
I:48;2034;the Patriot is a much more personal movie, revolving around a man of simple entertainments and a family(chair.
I:48;2035;The wit in the writing, I think, merited Academy Awards.
I:48;2036;The villain was extreme, but provides a nice foil to Benjamin.
I:48;2037;Andrew de Moray, in truth, was Wallace's greatest ally.
I:48;2038;And the Bruce, king of scots, was the one with the leprosy.
I:48;2039;It seems a rich, and unmined vein.
I:48;2040;this is a wonderful picture that holds the viewers' attention from beginning to end.
I:48;2041;in the beginning, this film is character driven, and thanks to some great acting, and an unpretentious script, the viewer doesn't worry that the filmmakers don't get on with it, already, and start playing the battle scenes.
I:48;2042;It is therefore clear and easy to follow, while still having a flavor of the revolutionary period.
I:48;2043;This is an excellent choice.
I:48;2044;It is a great compliment to say that a script wasn't there, in the sense that the words are so natural, they really seem to come right from the characters.
I:48;2045;This movie helps to understand what is worth fighting for in this country otherwise burning a home or church full of civilians would be permitted by those in power.
I:48;2046;Mel Gibson's portrayal is similar to William Wallace from Braveheart with his shrewdness against England especially winning the affection of two Great Danes Mercury and Mars.
I:48;2047;This is a wonderful movie that has it all.
I:48;2048;Love/romance, military battles, great locations for the outdoor scenes.
I:48;2049;This is a fantastic movie that I've watched multiple times and plan on watching it many more times.
I:48;2050;the scenery is great through out the movie.
I:48;2051;The acting is very good.
I:48;2052;well written story as well as produce.
I:48;2053;That said, it's quite amazing that the thing manages to come off as well as it does.
I:48;2054;He delivered the immortal C minus line in Armageddon.
I:48;2055;one of the few lines in that movie that made it worth watching.)
I:48;2056;Along with Isaacs, excellent performances are turned in by Heath Ledger, Gregory Smith, and the always.
I:48;2057;This is definitely a Hollywood treatment of an important historical era.
I:48;2058;This movie shines in its battle scenes and its treatment of patriotism.
I:48;2059;The colonials won this war because they were fighting for their homes and for their freedom.
I:48;2060;This film shows this aspect of the war very well.
I:48;2061;This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time.
I:48;2062;The extended cut improves an already good film.
I:48;2063;The Special Features also give a lot of the background behind the film.
I:48;2064;While the story itself is fiction, it is based upon historical characters.
I:48;2065;If you are looking for strict historical accuracy, """"The Patriot"""" takes liberties."""
2066;The movie does give the viewer a look at the colonial life style (albeit through rose colored glasses) and gives you an appreciation of the horors of 18th century warfare.
2067;Definitely a five star movie.
2068;while we can break down all the technical faults, the fact is that it's riveting, powerful, and heart wrenching entertainment (why i gave it 5 stars).
2069;rAY and it displays magnificent picture and uncompressed surround sound.
2070;the Patriot is a vastly entertaining and moving film that gives a glimpse of our fight for freedom from England.
2071;The performances are excellent and so is John Williams stirring musicaql score.
2072;The British are venal and one dimensional, the Americans scarcely more interesting.
2073;A father's determination to keep his family together.
2074;Given the concept that the actual war lasted 5 years it gives it the chance to cover the majority of it.
2075;Our failures and successes as well as the eventual victory over the oppressive English.
2076;Watch this film with the family.
2077;The violence is graphic, but the language is suitable for the entire family.
2078;And it's worth the time.
2079;Great movie about a long overlooked portion of the American Revolution.
2080;My son, who is learning about the Revolution in 4th grade, enjoyed it very much.
2081;The movie was watchable and entertaining, but can't see it becoming a classic.
2082;This story is a great family title with a great story line that impresses on the family values and togetherness.
2083;Well, well, well, what can I say but BRAVEHEART PART 2!
2084;This is an entertaining film, made purely for profit which it got.
2085;I did enjoy the film for what it was, a movie made by Hollywood for money making purposes.
2086;This is the same movie, same plot, same grand scale yet without passion, honesty and charachter developement that BRAVEHEART was known for, maybe because of the director, or the script, we know it wasnt the actors, because they are great in what they had to use.
2087;Like I said however, it was entertaining and worth watching if you want a epic no brainer.
2088;This is really an amazing film when viewed against modern American culture.
2089;The message of the film is simple.
2090;As a father he decides to put his family above his principles.
2091;If I make sense, even if you do not agree with me, give this review a positive vote for making a good argument.
2092;Liberty awards the ambitious, the intelligent, and the risk takers.
2093;A mother, who raises children, sees to it that her children are treated fairly by those inside and outside of the family.
2094;Their concern, and rightly so, is the feeding and care of their children.
2095;compare this to our modern view of the military since Vietnam.
2096;some may say that this is well and good, the natural course of societal evolution.
2097;The Patriot was by far my favorite summer movie and one of my favorite movies of the year (only Gladiator comparing even close).
2098;face battling of that time, but Roland Emmerich, the director, really captures the struggle of all of the patriots trying to break free from England's short leash.
2099;Mel Gibson does an outstanding job of a reluctant militia man who's triggered to participate in the war after one of his sons is shot dead by the cruel English colonel William Tavington (played by Jason Isaacs [ Event Horizon ]).
2100;all the best movie this year that I've seen, one of my all.
2101;If you like war movies, you'll love The Patriot.
2102;Granted, the movies punctuates the plot with the same gratuitous violence that amazed us in Braveheart, which is fine, however, the story is an engaging and captivating tale that all Americans can appreciate.
2103;Mel Gibson does a remarkable job of leading this story, and the movie does a substantial job of referencing Revolutionary war tactics and bringing them to life.
2104;jason Isaacs as Colonel Tavington is the best thing about this film.
2105;He takes a two dimensional, cartoon villain and humanizes him, giving Tavington both depth and energy.
2106;A good example of an actor rising above his material.
2107;the cinematography is beautiful and the battle scenes well.
2108;It's the same movie, with a happy ending.
2109;It was a major accomplishment to bring this era on film.
2110;the hero and villains in The Patriot are like comic characters.
2111;This is a vehicle for Mel Gibson (an Aussie who claims to dislike violence in movies) to look good.
2112;This movie is a must.
2113;Mel Gibson does his customary stellar job, and the acting overall is pretty good, and the story is very good indeed.
2114;the thing I liked best about the movie is that it really did convey a sense of what it might have been like to live in American revolutionary times.
2115;I get a kick out of recommending this movie to my British friends.
2116;the story keeps going, there is a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.
2117;Mel Gibson steals the historical roles of several American leaders, providing even more distortion in this film.
2118;When I first watched the movie, I had a blast watching it.
2119;with only Mel Gibson pulling through with a good performance.
2120;"Heath Ledger put in a respectable performance, but he did better in ""Knight's Tale""!!!"
2121;Both the movies are fun to watch but, are not masterpieces by any means.
2122;there were though some nice visuals, and battles.
2123;My point is that they sholud have made the battles more realistic and intense.
2124;Yet, this movie does give credit to the people who really helped us gain the upper edge the milita.
2125;The movie also did give you the idea of what the patriots gave for freedom and liberty.
2126;yet it will be fun to watch at times.
2127;I say just go see something more innovative and something that hasn't been done before.
2128;overall, I will give this movie an 3/5,.
2129;pretty good historical fiction movie, but nothing impressive!!!
2130;"while splendidly filmed and acted, ""The Patriot"" attempts to foist emotional manipulation on us as an epic story."
2131;If it is not enough that one of his younger sons is callously murdered, we have to witness The Ghost's eldest son stabbed to death, and his son's beautiful young wife and innocent townspeople burned alive in a church.
2132;The Patriot, with all its faults, is quite entertaining if you except it for what it is.
2133;a well made Revolutionary War action film with good acting and a comic book caliber plot.
2134;still good, worth seeingI love movies, and believe that you should at least watch a movie once, to at least say that you have seen it, you really cant knock a movie if you havent seen it.
2135;I like this movie enough I added it my collection to watch it again.
2136;The Patriot is great Historical Fiction and a timely reminder about the course of Human Events that led to the creation of the American Experiment.
2137;everyone in the world should see The Patriot
2138;The product was in great condition when delivered.
2139;The Patriot is a well acted and well executed motion picture.
2140;Mel Gibson delivers another stellar performance as a man who is torn between a brutal past and an uncertain future.
2141;Heath Ledger is very good as Gibson's eldest son, who enlists in the Continental Army against his father's wishes.
2142;The musical score by John Williams provides an emotional undertone to the epic action and dramatic scenes between Gibson and his family.
2143;This is the best Revolutionary War movie made.
2144;when he tries to voice his opinon in a meeting with superiors and peers of his own townspeople and General Cornwallis , Martin voices his mind about the war that it should stop and peace should be made with both sideds but he's only ridiculed and laughed at even by his elder son who belives in what the war is doing.
2145;in this entertaining epic , many options , commentarys trailers , docudrams and informative info on the making of this film a fun film to watch.
2146;historically, the flick is suspect.
2147;"The Patriot follows ""Braveheart"" very closely, but the story does go its own direction at times, and there's more of a story to the bit players ."
2148;all, good for a night when you're in the mood for an epic, but nothing great is on.
2149;There are some movies that make my heart beat faster.
2150;Patriot is one of my favorites.
2151;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are superb.
2152;These days it is hard to find a movie with a good male role model, and whether you are male or female, I think you will agree, Benjamin Martin is an excellent role model.
2153;I can tell you ive always in joyed this film.
2154;It can be action packed and still bring tears to your eyes.
2155;It got there on time and was well received by my son.
2156;he has watched it since and tells me that this addition has more enhanced scenes than the original movie.
2157;So, if you love action adventure, history and a love story to boot, with some gore, blood and guts thrown in, then you will love this film.
2158;Mel Gibson does a great acting job and has a great supporting cast.
2159;It veers over the top to entertain and go for spectacular action.
2160;This fine flick deserves to be in your film collection.
2161;Well done with something for everyone: romance, action, and history.
2162;Mel Gibson brings his usual charm and is easily matched by newcomer Heath Ledger.
2163;Fantastic casting, lovely soundtrack, powerful dialogue, and haunting scenery make this movie more than worthwhile!
2164;One of the best films I have ever watched.
2165;I felt like I was right there with Mel in the heat of the action.
2166;"and she replies in comedy tone ""Hey it's a free country."
2167;Much of Mel Gibson's own influence is in this movie.
2168;Cornwallis is a man we love to hate.
2169;The message of patriotism, love of family and home is all quite strong here.
2170;But it does make a good film if you're into this period, if you want to see Mel Gibson doing a historic piece and as the hero which he always does so well in.
2171;Mel Gibson, though much older now, is still a great actor and provides much romantic/sex appeal.
2172;On the other hand, the epic nature of the film .
2173;with its great costumes and the requisite cast of thousands (real and computer.
2174;Great story and very interesting.
2175;It's a good movie in it's own right.
2176;It romanticizes the American Revolution and was deliberatly crafted toward that end.
2177;Any one who has studied history knows where the writers and such used heavy artistic license, but hey, it's a great fun and really makes you want to join the Army or something.
2178;It's a great war film and Mel is outstanding as always.
2179;The final battle is classic.
2180;People did it (whether they wanted to or not, but that's another story and will be told at another time) Worth seeing.
2181;A good blend of BraveHeart and The Last of the Mohicans .
2182;If you like those two, you will welcome The Patriot .
2183;A good try at romance but not quite up to Mohican's standards.
2184;Mel Gibson is back and gives one of his best performances ever as Revolutionary war Fighter and Patriot Benjiman Martin.
2185;it has a great story, a great cast, great f/x, a great score, it's just spectacular!
2186;I would recommend this to history lovers as well as Mel Gibson fans and those of you just looking for a good movie.
2187;in my opinion this ranks as the third best movie of 2000.
2188;heath Ledger is really an up.
2189;mel Gibson has seven children of his own (I think), and therefor I think that he could play his part very well, because he can feel into it.
2190;He can express his emotion really good.
2191;this movie is worth 5 stars, because it has everything: Action, Tragedy, a little bit of Romance and Victory.
2192;It was a great STORY.
2193;This story is about one man, and his family.
2194;Slavery was awful and it is the crux of many well made and enjoyable films, but it is just not the main backdrop in THIS story.
2195;This movie from me and my husband recieved a thumbs up.
2196;Mel Gibson is excellent as the patriot.
2197;"His portrayal of the father is a very sensitive one, as Gibson displays an array of emotions and the changes in the sensitive expressions on his face
I:48;2198;i have watched this film over and over again, and i enjoy it every time.
I:48;2199;This is my favorite and one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:48;2200;My whole family loves it and I want my kids to know the true history of America and not be brainwashed by the America.
I:48;2201;Mel Gibson is just fantastic.
I:48;2202;A great drama and one of our favorites.
I:48;2203;The scenes of him holding his dying sons in his arms are particularly powerful.
I:48;2204;Sappy dialog and historical inaccuracies mixed with some scenes of undeniable power and beauty.
I:48;2205;A great movie loved it a must own All time classic Gibson at his best a timeless tale of courage and bravery of our men and the fight for freedom to become a free nation
I:48;2206;Its infortunate that so many people compare this to Mel's other movie, Braveheart which in itself is a masterpiece.
I:48;2207;What I thought was that The Patriot would just be Braveheart on American soil shocked me.
I:48;2208;Special praise is deserved to Jason Isaacs who played his part perfect.
I:48;2209;You rarely see a Villan done so well with such malicious intent.
I:48;2210;esque portrayal of the peculiar institution.
I:48;2211;Still, though, I think a reasonably intelligent individual will see what's coming a mile ahead in this movie, irregardless of their cinematic familiarity.
I:48;2212;correct slaves our master pays us and the mute daughter Poppa!
I:48;2213;I admire Mel Gibson with his directorial prowess on Braveheart, The Passion and Apocalypto.
I:48;2214;If you have a penchant for Rambo style action this is for you.
I:48;2215;A family is caught in between the fight.
I:48;2216;A Murdered son, a vindictive father, and a strong headed fighter.
I:48;2217;They all mix together to make an epic film that says hey this is what really happened!
I:48;2218;The ending seens of this movie are the ideal hero scences mounted on horse while the star spangled banner waves in the sunsent.
I:48;2219;The film is one of the best climax structured films I had ever seen.
I:48;2220;One of the best war/drama films in our time.
I:48;2221;This is, beyond a doubt, one of the most moving historical fiction films I've seen in the last 10 years.
I:48;2222;A good deal of the plotline revolves around the conflicts between Gibson and Ledger.
I:48;2223;Battle scenes are extremely realistic, and there are some real atrocities committed by soldiers.
I:48;2224;With that caveat in mind, though .
I:48;2225;remember that these are the sorts of things that actually happened during the Revolutionary War, and watch the film with an open mind.
I:48;2226;This Movie was a great suspenseful War movie I've never seen anything like it before.
I:48;2227;Seeing The patriots son die right in front of them was one of many tradigies to come and well then he would have revenge just by the look on his face seeing this movie made me think people really do this fight for our country no matter what it takes, and well it really takes some guts to do that.
I:48;2228;Seeing the patriot decide to go back is like miracle to all of them and just seeing his little girl talk for the first time ever for the patriot is like a miracle for him and promises her that he will return.
I:48;2229;The patriot then has much love for his country after seeing mostly all his family die in front of him defeat the redcoats without his son but with the soul of his sons life and the love of the rest of the people he did have.
I:48;2230;Of course the story of a family in the middle of the American Revolution is going to be both sad and inspirational.
I:48;2231;At the same time you see the strength and perserverance of the people who fought the war that made us free.
I:48;2232;The story is incredible and heart.
I:48;2233;A lot of action drama and suspense.
I:48;2234;Mel Gibson does a great job and the story is awesone
I:48;2235;There were so many moments when I laughed and said enough, already.
I:48;2236;the sound of muskets and cannon are a refreshing change from all other war movies!
I:48;2237;Hopefully an accurate depiction of the way things were during the birth of our great nation.
I:48;2238;To my surprise, I found it was truly an amazing movie.
I:48;2239;THe Patriot was great, I thought.
I:48;2240;Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson did an absolutely great acting job, best I've seen.
I:48;2241;The directing job was excellent.
I:48;2242;A good setting and storyline, with plenty of humor, tradgedy and plot.
I:48;2243;OK, this is one of my favorite movies.
I:48;2244;There were a few things that were inaccurate but when you compare the movie to many others it was fantastic!!!
I:48;2245;I found it to be an extremely moving film.
I:48;2246;action, suspence, and some romance and comedy (without going overboard).
I:48;2247;His acting was sensational (as always).
I:48;2248;This is a great movie!!!
I:48;2249;most Brits are angry with the depiction of us as murderers, because of the church burning scene, as well as the other actions of the lead british villain.
I:48;2250;many US writers in these reviews also forget that their ancestors butchered a considerable number of POWs themselves, starting with those captured at Lexington Green.
I:48;2251;discovers his love for his country through his love for his children.
I:48;2252;the costumes are perfect and guide the veiwer to another time and place.
I:48;2253;The cast is masterful at what they do, and the writers have truly made a movie that has brought the story full circle as well as developed a plot making the audience think about the true value of family, and patriotism, and how the two work together.
I:48;2254;They are believable and you truly will hate them as much as you love the good guys.
I:48;2255;There are a few scenes that will break your heart.
I:48;2256;satisfaction is guaranteed when seeing the patriot.
I:48;2257;gibson is absolutely awe inspiring on the battlefield in this 2000 summer hit movie.
I:48;2258;The final showdown between Benjamin Martin(Mel Gibson) and Tavington is masterfully choreographed.
I:48;2259;This is a good film starring Mel Gibson.
I:48;2260;it shows us how people are willing to sacrifice everything to win their freedom.
I:48;2261;The Patriot is a good movie.
I:48;2262;The formula, as Gibson obvioulsy learned from Braveheart, is to make an epic.
I:48;2263;looking flick with a good buddy system, eternally constipated seriousness, and a lot of shouting.
I:48;2264;Braveheart is arguably the best movie ever made, short of the second Ben Hur!
I:48;2265;It was a masterpiece by all accounts!
I:48;2266;The Patriot is still a great movie!
I:48;2267;A beautifully filmed movie that gives a very accurate feel for the era.3.
I:48;2268;The characters here are symbolic of whole groups.
I:48;2269;That the movie was even made was a rather gutsy act.5.
I:48;2270;The MORAL of this movie is the most important one a person in today's world could ever hear: that THEY have inaleniable natural rights that supercede the authority of any government, and they have the God.
I:48;2271;The American Revolution was a war for freedom against a nation that still loves to ceremonially honor a time when a royal family owned them like cattle.7.
I:48;2272;This movie perfectly illustrates why the second ammendment was included in the US Constitution.
I:48;2273;This movie was so good, I just had to have it.
I:48;2274;So I bought it and I love it.
I:48;2275;The acting is great, the research was wonderful, and the directing was awesome.
I:48;2276;I love American History, and this movie exceeded all my thoughts of what it would be.
I:48;2277;The storyline was so powerful and moving.
I:48;2278;I hadn't realized how horrible and cruel the British had been during the Revolutionary War, but once I saw this I did, and it moved me it was that powerful.
I:48;2279;Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger were awesome in this movie, and all of Benjamin Martin's children did a great job with the acting.
I:48;2280;I, at thirteen, believe that Heath Ledger was superb in this, considering he's so good looking!
I:48;2281;(Another great movie to see!)
I:48;2282;A definite winner, for sure.
I:48;2283;This is a paradoxical film to review on the one hand it is well made, superbly shot and, taken purely as an adventure story in its own right, excellent.
I:48;2284;The patriot is wildly inaccurate at times and also applies today's morals to 225 years ago.
I:48;2285;sided films like the Patriot.
I:48;2286;'The Patriot' is a superb war story about the American Revolutionary War.
I:48;2287;it features superb acting by Mel Gibson (as Col. Benjamin Martin), Heath Ledger (Gabriel Martin) and Jason Isaacs as British Col. William Tavington.
I:48;2288;The supporting cast does a great job as well.
I:48;2289;It is a work of fiction that is very well done.
I:48;2290;this is highly recommended for anyone who loves a great war movie, particularly one about the Revolutionary War which is seldom depicted in the movies.
I:48;2291;From the fight scenes to the touching story line.
I:48;2292;It kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:48;2293;The end was even good for once.
I:48;2294;All I can say is watch this movie, and you'll be glad I said WATCH IT!
I:48;2295;This is a very well done movie .
I:48;2296;I was not even a huge fan of Mel Gibson when I first viewed the movie"
2297;I believe this gets very close to how it was for a 'well to do family' at that time.
2298;"I think this film ranks right up there with ""Braveheart"" This is a true epic movie from start to finish."
2299;This is one of my all time favorites.
2300;million dollar movies are made to entertain more than educate.
2301;Watch it as the fiction it is, and I'm sure you'll spend a magnificent 165 minutes in another world.
2302;A good mix of action, emotion, and all goodies you like to find in an entertaining movie.
2303;This entertaining and inspiring film offers an insightful portrait of the era of the American Revolution, from the perspective of one family caught up in its effects and circumstances in South Carolina starting in 1776, then mostly 1780.81.
2304;His likable rebel leader recruits locals into a militia and scores a few underdog successes disrupting the occupying British operations.
2305;the film is beautifully photographed and has a score composed by John Williams (Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan).
2306;The careful attention to period language, names, clothing, and customs adds authenticity to the story.
2307;There is much to show how the war affects the Martin family.
2308;Gabriel enters the local church at one point and he, with the help of his childhood friend Anne Howard's (Lisa Brenner) impassioned speech, rally the people to the defense of their town and country.
2309;the film has many engaging and entertaining action sequences, and these build toward a final battle, which is dramatically and graphically depicted.
2310;The historical accuracy is not what it could be, but the story is told well, and captures the spirit of the Revolution in a memorable and inspiring way.
2311;Note that it is 2 Australian Actors and a German Director bringing American Patriotism to life here, but they do such a good job, in a great film that is watchable and inspiring again and again.
2312;This has long been one of my favorite films and one that is often forgotten about when Mr. Gibson's resume comes up.
2313;Never mind the bad press he has gotten over the years, he has still produced a credible body of work and The Patriot is certainly up there with his best.
2314;Really well done on that score.
2315;The audio also was nicely balanced between the center channel dialogue and foley fx going to the sides or rears.
2316;Loved Mel Gibson's acting in this flick.
2317;This film makes a great follow up to `Last of the Mohicans' which takes place in the years before the Revolutionary War.
2318;A lot of the battle scenes in `The Patriot' reminded me of the ones in `Mohicans'.
2319;Overall a very entertaining epic.
2320;The featurettes where decent and combined would make a nice little documentary.
2321;It was surprising to learn how many of the effects where digital.
2322;mentioned movies you will probably enjoy this movie.
2323;The `Special Edition' labeling tends to up the price that for the extras you get may not be worth it, but I enjoyed the epic enough to add this one to my collection.
2324;Ten years ago, the glorious Glory came from thirtysomething creator Edward Zwick.
2325;bodied characters, brings us The Patriot.
2326;in every sense of the word, the most beautiful movie of its year.
2327;hour tribute to American spirit.
2328;As Benjamin Martin, a reluctant war veteran who is finally moved to fight in the Revolutionary War when a redcoat kills one of his sons, Gibson sheds his familiar love.
2329;His character elicits laughter, tears, and bloodshed, and for the first time in years, Gibson emotes an honest.
2330;gibson's magnificent underplaying and Rodat's spare screenplay seem to have invigorated the rest of the cast as well.
2331;aleck in The Sixth Sense) as one of Martin's sons, seem just as juiced up as Gibson is.
2332;(I haven't even touched upon Caleb Deschanel's beautiful cinematography, or John Williams' best movie score since E. t.) And this is as it should be.
2333;The story itself is well written though, and the movie is well acted,the cast was well picked, and Mel Gibson actually made me feel as if he were fighting a battle inside himself up until he was pulled into the fray.
2334;The movie was well directed, and the cinematography was excellent.
2335;This movie was pretty cool.
2336;I am very much into true story movies.
2337;I'm a young person so I first wanted to see this movie because of the very talented and very gorgeous Heath Ledger!!
2338;But I found myself completely taken in by the story line!!!!!
2339;It is one of my favorite movies of all time!!
2340;But this whole movie makes the American Revolution real!!
2341;First of all let me say that this movie is a masterpiece.
2342;It is one of the best films I have ever seen.
2343;the costume are great and so is the battle scene .
2344;This film has terrific action and also very emotional parts.
2345;It is one of the best movies ever made by Mel Gibson and the photography is absolutely unbelievable.
2346;overall, this is a good, watchable movie with beautiful cinematography, great costumes, memorable characters, and a lot of action.
2347;It goes from a pretty realistic premise to melodrama, but it's entertaining enough if you get past that.
2348;Leaves you with a proud feeling of what was accomplished against tyranny.
2349;The Patriot offers plenty of action for Mel Gibson fans!
2350;The film's theme evokes memories of John Wayne and The Fighting Seabees .
2351;Brilliant photography and an exciting story make this a fine adventure film.
2352;Despite being predictable and laced with bland cliches throughout, The Patriot has a truly old fashioned flavor to it, and provides a strong sensation that you are actually living during this time period!
2353;yeah WOW is the way i describe this movie.
2354;altho it's a patriotic film, it still include some funny scenes, which is really kool.
2355;I enjoy this film each and every time I stick it into the player.
2356;A family is provided to move the plot along.
2357;A loyal wife and adorable little girls tug at our heart strings.
2358;Isaacs is at his best when ordering the so called traitors burned alive in the church.
2359;The director Roland Emmerich knows how to film scenes guaranteed to glue viewers to their seats even though this movie is every long.
2360;the Patriot also is a good.
2361;Costumes, backdrops, and battlefields are so well done as to be almost a work of art.
2362;It is very visually impressive.
2363;Plot and emotion are good, but The Patriot way overdoes it.
2364;I finally resumed interest in the final battle scene, which is impressive.
2365;Once again Mel Gibson comes out with a great film, this time set during the Revolutionary War.
2366;Good action, good script, reasonably accurate and a truly touching story.
2367;Great Bloody action throughout to give it four stars.
2368;By a tree hugging hippie director from the euro side of delusion?!!!
2369;We loved this movie and feel that every American, especially in these days of creeping.
2370;socialism, needs a good reminder of what America stands for and what our founders sacrificed to win us the freedoms which are now eroding more with each day.
2371;Mel Gibson did a very fine job.
2372;I don't want to compare this to Braveheart like everyone else, but if this was Gibson's next best historical epic, well then he'd better stop now!
2373;2 hours and 45 minutes is only made for films that can keep your attention the whole way through, i. e. Braveheart, and Boogie Nights.
2374;The third mistake was making the movie end in a happy way.
2375;Nonetheless, if you are looking for excitement, great battle scenes and the hero winning in the end, Patriot will work for you nicely.
2376;This was a great movie.
2377;Lets face it Cornwallis and the British where on a roll.
2378;i thought it was very good, though, taking that into consideration.
2379;"Gibson was very good
I:48;2380;this movie's got something for everyone.
I:48;2381;action, adventure, war, family, friendships, and they even tie in a few love lines.
I:48;2382;good movie, and the only reason it's rated R is that there's violence.
I:48;2383;The Patriot is a fine action/adventure drama about a South Carolina farmer in 1776 (Mel Gibson) who reluctantly becomes involved in the American Revolution.
I:48;2384;Those films were popcorn events whose only purpose was to entertain audiences in a loud fashion.
I:48;2385;Love them or hate them, those films succeeded in that respect.
I:48;2386;The Patriot is produced with the same flair as Emmerich's previous efforts, but this film succeeds remarkably where those films could not.
I:48;2387;This film is an exciting popcorn event film written and acted expertly.
I:48;2388;The Patriot may be Hollywood's first Oscar worthy popcorn film.
I:48;2389;the heart of the film is Mel Gibson's performance as Benjamin Martin.
I:48;2390;His oldest son"
2391;this film has all the aspects of a great summer event blockbuster.
2392;It has spectacular action sequences, villians and noble heroes, a strong supporting cast, a sweet romance and good hearted humor.
2393;It is also the first solid film by Roland Emmerich.
2394;He proves with the right screenwriter, in this case Saving Private Ryan 's Robert Rodat, that he can be a very effective filmmaker.
2395;This movie is wonderfully directed by Rolland Emmerich.
2396;He does a great job of setting the backdrop and showing the effect of the revolutionary war on America.
2397;soldier, a veteran of the French and Indian wars, during the eve of the American Revolution against Britain.
2398;rate reprisal of Mel Gibson's more accomplished historical epic Braveheart .
2399;Hey I know that this movie has TONS of historical falsities in it, but it was still a fun movie to watch!
2400;I love how the British are always portrayed as the bad guys!
2401;Anyway, there are some really great action scenes in this film, including the HUGE final battle between the Redcoats and the rag tag Continental Army.
2402;An all around action packed romp through South Carolina with Mel's portrayal of the Swamp Fox.
2403;This one is not for those who like their movies historically acurate, but hey I enjoyed it, and it is one of those films that makes me say proudly.
2404;actor, director, and has learned the cultures of Europe and the Americas.
2405;So this production offers not only a steady learning in history, but also how people of these culture give birth, live, contribute and grow in these cultures.
2406;Mel Gibson, among many things, snd identifies the highest values of women, and how these women adapt, accept and make a difference in their circumstances.
2407;whether it is youth, maturity, learning, critique, and understandable values.
2408;The substance is enhanced in his films.
2409;what lead me to watching this movie comes from the fact that I am an American and I love American History, and I love to learn how my country came to be the great country it is today, and what sacrifices were made for the U. s. a. to become a country, and this is a wonderful film to learn all that.
2410;the film takes place during the American Revolutionary War, mostly during the mid.
2411;After all, Great Britain had spent plenty of pounds fighting in American Colonies for the good of the Americans, and the crown was still supporting the British Army to help stop Native American attacks on the American frontier.
2412;Great Britain felt it was their legal and moral right to collect payment.
2413;One can learn quite a lot about the American Revolution by watching this film in fact.
2414;This film is also visually beautiful, and quite a treat for the eyes.
2415;"pick about some of the minor historical inaccuracies, and the thing is, this film is not a documentary, and it's not a history book
I:48;2416;I love American History, and I study it, and when I watch the movie, I don't notice any historical inaccuracies, and I don't look for goofs.
I:48;2417;I just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
I:48;2418;history buffs, some things had to more dramatized to make it more appealing and interesting to the casual fan who normally has no interest in history.
I:48;2419;It's mostly hardcore history buffs that nit.
I:48;2420;They are just looking to be entertained, as am I. I will also give an example of how just making a film entertaining as opposed to historically accurate can sometimes be a good thing:During the American Revolution, it's likely (although I'm not 100% sure) based on my studies, everyone (Americans included) spoke with an English accent, and it probably didn't even sound like today's English accent.
I:48;2421;However, from an entertainment stand point, in my view, I enjoy the fact that in """"The Patriot"""" the American characters speak in a modern American accent, and the English characters speak in a modern English accent."""
2422;Being an American myself, it makes me able to relate to the American characters more when I hear their American accent.
2423;Because of the difference in the accents between the American characters and the English characters, it creates more of a culture clash, and adds to the tension and makes it all the more entertaining.
2424;i think history buffs will enjoy this film, as well as anyone looking for a good movie to watch on the 4th of July.
2425;The Patriot however is a classic good vs. evil war film with the Americans as the heroes, and the English as the villians.
2426;"Granted, it shows the English point of view in the film, but it shows it in the same way ""Star Wars"" shows scenes that feature it's villians."
2427;You see the scenes of English soldiers interacting with each other, and you can learn more about them, but you will not likely be cheering for them or understanding their choices afterwards.
2428;work and planning it took to overcome such a strong and powerful English Army.
2429;"some have even compared ""The Patriot"" to ""Braveheart"" because both films star Mel Gibson, both are history films, and both are about Mel Gibson playing a character that leads a revolt against England."
2430;"ray for ""The Patriot"" is great."
2431;The audio and video are amazing.
2432;"The special features include two featurettes titled ""True Patriots"" and ""The Art of War"", which are both about the making of the film."
2433;the soundtrack to this film is absolutely *amazing*.
2434;"all and all, ""The Patriot"" is a great and fun film full of beauty, art, emotion, romance, education, action, and drama that will not only entertain you, but teach you a lot about early American history as well."
2435;It is a good film to watch anytime of the year, but it's extra fun to watch it around or on the 4th of July.
2436;It'll make the holiday twice as festive if you have a cool American Revolution film to watch.
2437;After swimming and enjoying BBQ all day, and popping some fireworks with your family on 4th of July, this is a great movie to pop.
2438;It will make you proud to be an American.
2439;I was surprised by The Patriot in that it was more entertaining than I had expected.
2440;Mel Gibson is a great actor and he makes great movies.
2441;i absolutely love this movie!I just can't stop watching it.
2442;I thought that 'The Patriot' was a great movie.
2443;I believe it was probably the best movie representation of the Rev. War.
2444;The war scenes were very graphic and true to the point.
2445;Aside from that the storyline was great.
2446;I thought that the young aussie Heath Ledger, who played Gabriel, gave the best performance.
2447;All the cast members we wonderful and this movie will go down in hollywood history as a major part of Americas past.
2448;still, for all its adherence to formula, The Patriot is certainly handsome and effectively rousing in small ways, like the scenes in which Martin smelts his dead son's toy soldiers into musket balls, or when he rallies farmers and villagers to arms, resulting in a motley militia of colorful roughnecks from central casting.
2449;The Patriot has drawn fire for being overly broad and historically inaccurate (both true), but it tackles its story with such passion and energy, it can be forgiven its few shortcomings.
2450;Mel Gibson gives one of his strongest performances as the colonial patriarch torn between protecting his family and joining the fight for American independence.
2451;The battle scenes are harrowing and intense and Jason Isaacs' Colonel Tavington is the most hissable period villain since Tim Roth in Rob Roy .
2452;The Patriot is a heartfelt, exciting Revolutionary War epic.
2453;The Patriot is a movie that takes place during the Revolutionary War period.
2454;The battle scenes are very cool (and I guess accurate?)
2455;This movie is surely one of a kind and is better than Braveheart.
2456;It is such a ride adding in some masterful cannon ball shots and a fabulous plot with so many things going on at once you will never be caught drifting off.
2457;After you see it once you immediately must own it.
2458;I saw it at my cousin's and bought it the next day.
2459;The special features are even at their best!
2460;Good story, plot and fairly gripping.
2461;I liked the historical aspect of it.
2462;"Lets get something strait
I:48;2463;Yes it makes the English look evil, and the Americans look like they are the best!!
I:48;2464;Once again it's a movie!
I:48;2465;Mel Gibson was born in NY State and moved with his family to Australia when he was a boy.
I:48;2466;however, I guess you can tell by now that I enjoyed this film.
I:48;2467;The story was well written, the cinematography was terrific, the special effects were wonderful, and once again John Williams composed another masterpiece.
I:48;2468;In short, I knew """"The Patriot"""" was a great movie when I got it."""
2469;I bought it for my 17 yr old and he loved it.
2470;historical content makes the film quite enjoyable.
2471;Seeing that most of us are from british origins and also from the same gene pool, along with the fact that their probably are only real allies, we should really give them more respect, obviously films like this dont help.
2472;It was a good movie, a little bloody for me, but that all depends on what you can handle!
2473;"winning experience that he had with ""Braveheart"" when he agreed to act in ""The Patriot."""
2474;The Patriot is a good movie.
2475;There's lots of blood, guts, gore, and swearing (for the men) along with a sweet story of the love a father has for his children (for the women).
2476;Perhaps this character is some descendant of William Wallace!But that aside, this movie *is* worth watching .
2477;The Patriot's saving grace is Heath Ledger, who is, I'm sure, going to become the new Mel Gibson.
2478;Heath is an incredible actor with a great grasp of depth and emotion.
2479;"I loved him ""Ten Things I Hate About You,"" and I loved him in this movie."
2480;"warm and fuzzy nostalgic ""Braveheart"" memories."
2481;Oh yeah, and England gets her butt kicked.
2482;Stargate, Independence Day, and even Godzilla were throwaway, enjoyable popcorn movies.
2483;The action scenes are among the best ever created (better than the all for shock value of Saving Private Ryan).
2484;Mel Gibson gives his best performance (rivaling Braveheart), and his on screen relationship with his son (Heath Ledger) is excellent.
2485;But let's look closer: no one actually knows everything William Wallace (of Braveheart) really did, yet it's an Oscar winner.
2486;The Patriot is a spectacular, rousing, and moving film which I thouroughly enjoyed.
2487;Those of you who can sit through Roland Emmerich's tedious commentary will get some pretty good insight into the creation of the movies characters.
2488;So grab the popcorn and enjoy a great film.
2489;"Few movies can generate such an impact on a viewer and impose such an overwhelming feeling of patriotism, as does Roland Emmerich's aptly titled summer film ""The Patriot""."
2490;Emmerich does a brilliant job setting each scene.
2491;"And what's more incredible is that ""The Patriot"" is very well written, especially for such a time period as the 18th century."
2492;And now that we have a potential epic on our hands, all we need now is Hollywood's favorite leading man to make it complete.
2493;"But what undoubtedly gave Gibson an edge in casting processes is a little movie in which he played a Scottish warrior vying for ""FREEDOM!"""
2494;And also in which the topic of patriotism was underlined.
2495;"And one can easily contrast ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" and find the similarities striking."
2496;And so I conclude that in spite of Gibson's great performance, Emmerich simply had to find someone else to portray a lead character.
2497;And give it credit for at least not having Gibson stab the bad guy with Old Glory.
2498;fashioned epic, complete with a cast of thousands (even if many of them are digital), glorious widescreen photography and a fine score by John Williams.
2499;The theatrical cut boasts a good array of extras, with some featurettes and trailers that were not carried over to the extended cut that is also available.
2500;Mel Gibson does a fantastic job of portraying true partiotism.
2501;He does a great job of showing what life was like during that time period and wonderfully attempts to instill a sense of freedom in all viewers.
2502;This movie was entertaing and completely worth while, Mel Gibson does a great job writing directing and starring in this movie and does so with pride and enthusiasm.
2503;this is a great movie starining mel gibson.
2504;This picture has more in common with DIE HARD than genuine American history.
2505;To be sure, there are moments when something approaching genuine history shines through, despite the writer's best efforts to the contrary.
2506;But by and large THE PATRIOT leaves us unmolested by fact.
2507;blank shooting, clever repartee with bloodthirsty enemies, a man of peace called back for one last mission of revenge.
2508;The producers try, and largely succeed, to imbue the picture with an authentic historic look.
2509;It just LOOKS fabulously real.
2510;to be fair, THE PATRIOT gives a general sense of truth.
2511;You'll definitely exit with a sense of the importance of the Carolinian part of the war.
2512;"The ""True Patriots"" vignette is particularly rewarding, as it gives a sense of the efforts taken by everyone but the writer to imbue the movie with a sense of authenticity."
2513;The director/producer commentary is worth hearing, but I found it hard to listen to at times.
2514;It's producer Dean Devlin who gives the most insight into the actual filmmaking process.
2515;The Patriot is a great film which exemplifies the American Character.
2516;The Patriot shows the core values of what it means to fight for god, country, and family.
2517;Anyone interested in the Revolutionary War should see this flick.
2518;The supporting actors are uniformly good and the cinematography is excellent.
2519;The patriot is another huge scale, high budget film done by Mel Gibson.
2520;This movie is comparable to Braveheart because it seems that it uses the same type of formula Braveheart did.
2521;The movie (just like Braveheart) contains a good mix of action, battle scenes and compassion.
2522;This movie can be enjoyed by males and females alike.
2523;The historical innaccuracies will turn this enjoyable movie experience into a game that consists of picking out everything that is wrong.
2524;This alone will extinguish any entertainment value for that person and anybody watching it with them.
2525;Recently we watched an edited version of this in my 8th grade history class, so as to give us a feel of how life was during the American Revolution.
2526;It sure does portray the life of the people and from what I hear of what happens during the battle scenes (remember I saw an edited version) it truly deserves and R rating.
2527;Anyways, if you don't mind the gory deatails I'd definately watch this fantastic movie!
2528;Needless to say, the film is so wildly inaccurate that it's probably more entertaining if you view it without having much knowledge of American History.
2529;The Patriot is filled with historical howlers.
2530;Because they were purely noble, while the British were heartless Nazis and aristocratic fops.
2531;"According to ""The Patriot"", race relations in 18th century South Carolina were quite good
I:48;2532;This guy burns down houses and murders women and children just for the fun of it.
I:48;2533;motions movie, and it's pretty easy to predict the end of every scene.
I:48;2534;i can't really recommend """"The Patriot"""" to anyone other than Mel Gibson fans and those who believe that the American Revolution was divine and holy, with no flaws or moral amibguity (those kind of people are probably Mel Gibson fans anyways)."""
2535;How sad that Hollywood had the money, the manpower, major talent, and maybe the intent to make a potentially landmark film about the Revolution.
2536;It's amazing that so many moviemakers have so many resources at their artistic disposal and are so clueless to the greater importance and responsibility of posterity, not to mention art and history.
2537;I watched this film and marvelled with approval at the incredible recreation of the period, the wonderful energy and superb acting, and then watched with dismay as it went unbelievably nowhere.
2538;In the true modern Hollywood calculation, adolescent sensation reigns supreme over mature fidelity and intelligent informed dramatic engagement.
2539;Two brilliant stars for the recreators and the actors, three very dead stars for the scriptwriters, the director, and the producers.
2540;The Patriot is cinema at it's finest.
2541;With great acting and fantastic directing, I can't think of any other way of putting it.
2542;mel Gibson, in my opinion, gives one of, if not the best performances of his career.
2543;He makes you feel for his character and the things going on around him.
2544;You feel great sympathy for his family and the ordeals that many families in the war times of the 1700's went through.
2545;This is a mark of a good actor.
2546;The setting was beautifully photographed.
2547;The directing was also top notch.
2548;I'm not too familiar with Roland Emmerich's work, but I will definitely check out his other films.
2549;everything about The Patriot I absolutely loved.
2550;When first news of The Patriot reached my ears, i thought, Oh, great, Braveheart 2.
2551;Mel Gibson kicking British booty.
2552;As opposed to many critics, I found the movie to be a fabulous film.
2553;Mel Gibson delivers a great performance as a family man/French and Indian War hero with a dark past trying to be a single dad and build chairs.
2554;Gibson is backed with the strong performance of Heath Ledger, who plays his son.
2555;The Patriot isn't Braveheart, but it definitely can hold its own.
2556;"At the Height of Mel Gibson's career and after his oscar win for his epic masterpiece ""Braveheart"", he starred in this American Revolution Epic that is one of the best American war movies ever made, spectacular battle sequences and great storytelling, one of the best movies of 2000, a spectacle telling of American History."
2557;This is an awesome movie about the revolutionary war, while not fiction it is a great story line and portrays some real aspects about the war and of the British Dragoons.
2558;Powerful movie, good story line, and at the end of the day, this is just the type of movie I would gravatate too!!
2559;Thank you, Amazon for carrying the movie, and of course, your values can't be beat!!
2560;The beautiful setpieces and the amazing Jason Isaacs.
2561;He takes up arms for the simple purpose of revenge.
2562;the scenes between Tavington and Martin (except the final death scene, which is just awful) and the scenes between Tavington and Cornwallis (played by the marvelous Tom Wilkinson) are the best scenes in the movie.
2563;The colors of the movie jump out of the screen and when you can see the fibers flying off of the British soldiers uniforms into the wind as they wait for battle, you know you are watching a great HiDef movie.
2564;Recommend to anyone that wants a great Mel Gibson movie and having it on blu ray is worth it.
2565;Had seen the movie before but loved seeing it again!
2566;The writer and producer of the movie do an outstanding job pulling the audience in and keeping the audience interested due to many unexpected scenes throughout the duration of this piece.
2567;"keep moving forward,"" to the men fighting in their Militia (""The Patriot."
2568;This shows that the writer may have gathered random Revolutionary War facts and threw them all together for a nice mix up in the movie, it spiced up the film per say.
2569;although there are a handful of inaccurate scenes in the memorable movie The Patriot, this film does a tremendous job giving you a taste of what it was like living in the mid 1700's.
2570;the brutality of the movie itself gives you a great inside look on how life and war went on back then.
2571;Although The Patriot has it's inaccuracies, critics, and myself included, are willing to look past that aspect and respect the movie The Patriot as one of the best war films of all time, let alone best film of all time about the Revolution.
2572;i thought this movie was moving, historically accurate, and quite entertaining.
2573;July is a great time to remember the sacrifices made during the revolutionary war.
2574;Mel Gibson is the best at showing emotion without a word.
2575;One of my favorite movies!
2576;The sound of muskets firing is as realistic as the machine guns firing and casings dropping to the ground in Saving Private Ryan.
2577;It was very realistic and demonstrative of the evils of war.
2578;It is well done and very interesting at all times!
2579;This is a great movie for history buffs and anyone liking to see gore (and there's plenty).
2580;The scenes are very well shot, the graphics are wonderful, and like all Mel Gibson's movies, there's good acting.
2581;"what I meant by ""fake"" is it's made up."
2582;Excellent movie, but groosome at times!
2583;This is a great epic.
2584;Yes it may be a wee bit long, but its worth the 3 hours to watch it.
2585;esque its a great thing to watch.
2586;No one really cares if it was historically correct or completely realistic and accurate to those times.
2587;Just watch it and have fun with it.
2588;history is always a delicate subject to tackle in movies etc. because sompeople feel they make light of their country's history, but please people let's take these things for what they are good entertainment
2589;The Patriot spins a good Hollywood yarn using the Revolutionary War as its backdrop.
2590;We have our stalwart and true hero, widower Benjamin Martin (in an effective performance by Mel Gibson) raising a family all by himself.
2591;Benjamin has the pleasure of meeting the savage, sadistic and British Col. William Tavington, (played flawlessly by Jason Isaacs) who arrives on his property to take Gabriel away to be hanged.
2592;It is a basic plot that's received an intense treatment of Hollywood Glamourization but it's a success because it understands that and has no illusions about being anything more or anything less.
2593;The performances by the actors are strong.
2594;The movie, at times, strays dangerously close to rising to the heights of Cheesedom, but overall it's a satisfying watch.
2595;Just don't think about it too much, sit back and be prepared to enjoy a contrived but entertaining epic.
2596;The actress is adorable and does a phenomenal job in the scene, making a potential very cheesy moment quite powerful.
2597;that being said, the war scenes are amazing.
2598;The sweeping camera shots and bright colors, combined with the graphic special effects convey the realism.
2599;1) Gives us a nice (if not entirely accurate) taste of American history, and 2) Succeeds in making the scenes about family just as important as the battles.
2600;For that, I'll give 4 stars anyday.
2601;genealogy has made it so interesting to relive the era of this film since my DNA places my ancestors in this local historically.
2602;This is not for want of some good acting: Mel Gibson is actually one of my favorite actors and Heath Ledger does a surprisingly good job with the film.
2603;Our hero has to be the most sympathetic character, so we make him a widower secretly pining for his dead wife's sister.
2604;The crimes committed in this film by British forces have absolutely no basis in historical fact.
2605;An entertaining enough yarn, if you can turn off the proverbial historian's cap and ignore the liberties with history.
2606;If you loved Braveheart you will like The Patriot.
2607;Not quite as much action but still a great movie.
2608;Personally, I thought The Patriot was a well.
2609;I found Benjamin Martin's past in the movie intriguing, and the battle scenes were choreographed nicely.
2610;There were a couple of parts that were a bit choppy, but overall, a very entertaining movie.
2611;Wonderful historical extravaganza with a major drawback.
2612;(If you didn't see Braveheart, you'll probably love it.)
2613;The Patriot, as entertainment, is an excellent movie with some exceptional acting.
2614;If people know their Revolutionary War history, they can enjoy the movie and accept it for its entertainment value alone.
2615;As a resident of the Charleston area I did enjoy the scenes filmed here.
2616;I give it 5 stars for showing Benjamin Martin's commitment to his family, and how the rebellious Gabriel picked up and finally understood when he had a wife of his own.
2617;For those who complain that it was too gory, you can watch Alice in Wonderland.
2618;This shows people who were dedicated and willing to fight for what they believed in!
2619;Mel Gibson was at his best!
2620;I think this movie is a very well made movie.
2621;all the actors who acted in this movie were excellent.
2622;The Patriot is a wonderful movie about a family torn apart by war, and how, at the end they once again reunite, amid the loss of two of their family members.
2623;They are done beautifully and, according to the bonus materials, with a high value placed on authenticity.
2624;The movie is shot in picturesque locales and with great camera work.
2625;probably the best part of the movie though is the wonderful dynamic between Heath Ledger and Mel Gibson.
2626;There are many good performances to compliment those two, in fact there is not a weak link in the movie.
2627;A must see moment is when Gibson's youngest daughter talks to her father the first time.
2628;In fact I got teary.
2629;We were happy to get the Special Edition, also.
