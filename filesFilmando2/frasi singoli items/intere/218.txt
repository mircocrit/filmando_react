I:28;1;It's the kind of movie I wonder how it even got past the script stage.
I:28;2;What I love about that film is that it's deep and full of substance, and just plain beautiful.
I:28;3;Nothing about this movie attracts me to it.
I:28;4;"After praising ""Metropolis"" as ""one of the most visually beautiful movies ever made in the entire history of cinema."
I:28;5;"Much more impressive than Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" which is the mother of all sci."
I:28;6;"fi eyeball dazzling visual extravaganzas"" ."
I:28;7;"First off so many films have come along since that are much more impressive and secondly, while comparing this ""Metropolis"" to Fritz Lang's is unavoidable and not entirely without merit, it's still wrongheaded to imply the cartoon is simply superior."
I:28;8;Wrong because it isn't superior and because the animation style of a 21st century cartoon and the visual effects of a sci.
I:28;9;"an inspiration for central plot elements maybe more than visual style, but also ""Blade Runner"" and ""Akira""."
I:28;10;a new classic on your hands.
I:28;11;Is it a soul, or the warmth of blood flowing inside us?
I:28;12;Director Rintaro's Metropolis examines this question throughout the film, and makes it the central theme of the film, from beginning to end.
I:28;13;the cast of Metropolis is filled with imaginitive, diverse characters.
I:28;14;There are both humans and machines in the story, ranging from the robot.
I:28;15;destroying Rock, to the cute, helping robot Fifi.
I:28;16;metropolis is a very complex piece of art, and it shows it.
I:28;17;The story of Metropolis is also filled with references to various ancient stories, most notably the Tower of Babel.
I:28;18;metropolis has majestic, elegant animation.
I:28;19;This is the first review I have written where I have mentioned the sheer beauty of the animation, and deservingly so.
I:28;20;The animation is a mixture of both CGI and traditional cel animation, so it just pops off the screen, capturing our attention and imagination both at once.
I:28;21;in all, Metropolis is wonderful anime, and is one that I like to call a piece of art.
I:28;22;For this feat, I commend Rintaro and the staff on the film.
I:28;23;The animation is good, in a unique way, some of the dudes from Akira and ancestors of Astro Boy, those are classics, well it was something like that!
I:28;24;I love the old school animation to it and the story line.
I:28;25;I'm a huge fan of the art style used in this film, so I really enjoyed the viewing experience.
I:28;26;top as other anime flicks, but it is visually a fun experience and has rightfully earned it's place on my collection shelf.
I:28;27;What an anime needs to be an animation with a story that includes characters and stories with depth.
I:28;28;That's what seperates it from cartoons.
I:28;29;Note that I say characters.
I:28;30;And we all know the Technology Vs. Humanity questions that arise, but this is still one great movie.
I:28;31;In some places it's downright amazing.
I:28;32;The Dub is fairly well done too, for those of you who don't like to read subtitles.
I:28;33;I must say that I was quite surprised at how this movie turned out to be.
I:28;34;"The plot was very interesting as well
I:28;35;rendered backgrounds in this movie look great (they don't look cheesy at all).
I:28;36;Two thumbs up for the city of Metropolis!
I:28;37;The visuals of the city are simply breathtaking!
I:28;38;that is a great scene!)
I:28;39;It was interesting to see the underground levels beneath the city .
I:28;40;With their huge eyes and round features, they appear too cutesy to fit in with the very real city of Metropolis.2.
I:28;41;While the idea is great, the story never gets developed in the film.
I:28;42;Who chose the songs to play during the most spectacular and dramatic scenes!?
I:28;43;There are plenty other films that do a much better job at it.
I:28;44;(It actually deserves a '2' rating, but I was feeling generous and I enjoyed watching the city.)
I:28;45;I felt tricked by the good reviews for this movie.
I:28;46;The slow pace isn't an issue, and used well it can be great.
I:28;47;But this movie has cringe worthy moments.
I:28;48;All these must be connected in order for a great story.
I:28;49;As for the animation, top notch, uncanny perfection in the movement, speaking as an animator myself, the cg was perfect and hit the scene sweetly.
I:28;50;And the strongest thing of the whole film I thought was the score.
I:28;51;Amazing Jazz, Dixieland, and some techno beats are weaved intricately throughout the film.
I:28;52;I still love it, with its flaws and all.
I:28;53;The movie is great, the shipping was efficient, and it came in a very sturdy case.
I:28;54;This was a nice movie.
I:28;55;but it didn't have much of a endingHowever, it is worth watching once.
I:28;56;And, just like the manga, the movie is an incomplete masterpiece.
I:28;57;the story deals with Duke Red, who desires to control and rebuild the world by using the Ziggurat, an enormous tower with a powerful weapon of horrific capabilities.
I:28;58;The plot isn't without its shortcomings, but overall it's very entertaining if the viewed in the correct way.
I:28;59;The backgrounds of the entire movie were computer generated and then covered with traditional cell shading, and the end result is absolutely stunning.
I:28;60;The movie even knows that it looks good, as several scenes are devoted entirely to showing off its breathtaking visuals.
I:28;61;The use of light and shadows in this movie is some of the best I've ever seen.
I:28;62;"style artwork from 30s Japanese cartoons such as ""Kimba the White Lion"" and, of course, ""Astroboy"", but I feel it suits the movie perfectly."
I:28;63;And the characters blend in perfectly with their CGI surroundings, making a movie a marvel to look at.
I:28;64;sound wise, everything is on par with the fantastic visuals.
I:28;65;inspired pieces that give the movie that old.
I:28;66;style feeling, and the few pieces that aren't jazz.
I:28;67;"Even the only unoriginal song in the movie, Ray Charles' ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", works."
I:28;68;"If you think about what had happened, what is happening during the climax, what Kennichi and Tima have gone through, and the overall theme of the movie, you'll see why ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" is perfect."
I:28;69;In regards to the dub, it's very well done and uses some of the best voiceovers I've ever heard.
I:28;70;There are character sketches, breakdowns of certain scenes visually, and even a wonderful documentary detailing the creation of the movie (in Japanese only).
I:28;71;"all in all, ""Metropolis"" is a beautifully made movie, in more ways than one."
I:28;72;"While it's clearly not for everyone, it definitely has its appeal
I:28;73;Christmas is around the corner and my friend is going to love that I picked something off his wish list and its perfect.
I:28;74;And eventually, everything starts to fall into place, thus creating a rich, beautifully animated story.
I:28;75;a wonderful film that is fit for nearly all ages.
I:28;76;it's kind of hard to describe.
I:28;77;it's just a strange piece of work, in both good, and questionable ways.Yes, yes, me and my friend almost had a conniption from laughing at the end bit with that Ray Charles song.
I:28;78;but if you watch this, it will certainly give you something to remember.
I:28;79;making I've seen, animated or otherwise.
I:28;80;as the film begins, a celebration is being held in honor of the Ziggurat's completion.
I:28;81;Later it is revealed that Duke Red is using the assitance of a mad scientist named Laughton to create a robot girl who will compensate for his dead daughter and rule the world from a throne atop the Ziggurat.
I:28;82;soon after, a detective comes to Metropolis from Japan, along with his son, to investigate the whereabouts of the shady doctor Laughton.
I:28;83;Escorted by a robot guide, they travel below the city and discover the secrets behind Duke Red's sinister project.
I:28;84;duke Red's malevolent son, however, is envious of the robot girl, and destroys the complex, which burns to the ground.
I:28;85;The detective's son and the robot girl escape, which provides a few toughing scenes where they try to communicate.
I:28;86;the movie culminates in a remarkable confrontation between all of the central characters in the story.
I:28;87;the plot is compelling enough, but is the beauteous images in this movie which make it worth watching.
I:28;88;Hovering somewhere between hallucinatory fantasy and reality, they compel us to keep watching and connect with our deepest emotions.
I:28;89;Came 2 days earlier so that was great, nice packaging.
I:28;90;overall great prouduct and great movie in general
I:28;91;This is definitely NOT a children's movie.
I:28;92;very nice story line and although it seemed kind of short, plenty of time to get attached to the characters.
I:28;93;"Very few movies are worth $25 to me), but this is a ""must see"" at some point."
I:28;94;Every now and then, you will stumble upon a movie that takes your mind and imagination to the absolute limits.
I:28;95;Akira was one of these movies, and untill now, I have yet to see many that rate better than the classic Akira.
I:28;96;what I may call the best anime ever created .
I:28;97;has been released and it is oh so good!
I:28;98;I received my order just yesterday, and allready I have watched it 3 times!
I:28;99;It is so complex, that every time I see it, I find new things!
I:28;100;The animation is classic of the 1950s Japan era, and the music follows the same time line with big band and jazz music.
I:28;101;The integration of the two gives an absolutely astounding effect.
I:28;102;The movie is marvelous and the music is wonderful.
I:28;103;One of the best sci.
I:28;104;the colors and backround are so real and intreging.
I:28;105;The story is so real.
I:28;106;It's happy,sad,deperssing,lovly,wonderful,spectacular and I could go on forever.
I:28;107;Maybe it's happy,sad, or in the middle.
I:28;108;All I know is that I am going to watch this movie every chance I get.
I:28;109;ichi are the most kindest and loving people in the world, I hope this review helps you make a decision on whether to watch it or not.
I:28;110;Metropolis is literally the same canned storyline and social statements that made Japanese animation cutting edge in the late 80's.
I:28;111;This is a remarkably beautiful work of animation that pulls at your heart instead of going for your throat.
I:28;112;But Duke Red's adopted son, Rock, destroys the laboratory before the robot is activated.
I:28;113;She is found by a detective's young nephew, and the two wander the underbelly of the city, dodging Rock's attacks and bearing witness to an uprising by the proletariat.
I:28;114;i can't say much without spoiling the ending, but the film's climax is beautifully done, with Ray Charles singing I Can't Stop Loving You in the background.
I:28;115;the extras include interviews with Rin Taro and Katsuhiro Otomo themselves, as well as the voice cast, and the composer of the score, a history of the manga and anime Metropolis, design sketches from the anime, and segments on combining the cel animation with the CG backgrounds.
I:28;116;i have seen many anime movies an this is by far the best one.
I:28;117;It has amazing animation and characters.
I:28;118;The music was kinda odd, but i thought it fit the story very well.
I:28;119;The Anime is good, Story The best I seen in Years!
I:28;120;, and Sound it good too!!!
I:28;121;For examples, an android, a werewolf, a vampire, and a surgeon.
I:28;122;It is like watching Akira (the comic is good.
I:28;123;Metropolis could have been one of the best animes of all time.
I:28;124;The story is wonderful, and the artwork dazzling.
I:28;125;But the music absolutely destroys it.
I:28;126;in a futuristic city (just called Metropolis), a leader of industry, known as Duke Red (self appointed royalty, I'm sure) has created a magnificent set of buildings known as the Ziggeraut.
I:28;127;Rock believes that Duke Red should take over the throne.
I:28;128;tat and takes control of the city and plans to seat Tima in the seat of power.
I:28;129;the animation and detail of the city is nearly flawless.
I:28;130;gothic city is shown in minute detail and vibrant colors, from the New York inspired skyscrapers to the flying machines that dot the cityscape.
I:28;131;The underground is also given great care and the the city core power unit is very well done.
I:28;132;The music, while unusual, works for me.
I:28;133;"son issues, sets off a chain of events that destroys the ziggeraut is accompanied masterfully by Ray Charles' ""I can't stop loving you""."
I:28;134;"one of the best movies ever that discusses the ""at what point do robots become human?"""
I:28;135;Alright I was hopeful that this anime would turn out to be a superb materpiece!
I:28;136;"if you want to see a true masterpeice seen the original, live action, silent, ""Metropolis""."
I:28;137;any movie done by Fritz Lang is better!!
I:28;138;and was told that metropolis is the top selling anime in USA at this time round.
I:28;139;that wasnt that much interesting and attactive sights i thuoght.
I:28;140;metropolis hav quite an interesting idea abt robots and stuff like that.
I:28;141;juz the story wasnt that nice.
I:28;142;again,well worth purchasing,attention to detail in the animation is good andif you collect Japanese based animation this is a good one to add to your collection.
I:28;143;The majority of METROPOLIS is visually stimulating, with rich backgrounds (for the most part) on the level of Geoff Darrow's HARD BOILED.
I:28;144;The screen graphics during Tima's cyber search through the phone lines are riddled with interesting goodies.
I:28;145;the final conflict and the use of Ray is truly superb.
I:28;146;at it's best, METROPOLIS is a beautiful feast for the eyes, beaming with high design and style.
I:28;147;Alrighty, I too am less than an otaku, but I know how to enjoy a good Anime movie.
I:28;148;music Soundtrack: 1/5Now the good stuff.
I:28;149;Voice Acting/Soundtrack: 4/5The animation and the smoothness of the Cel characters was amazing to say the least.
I:28;150;Other than that, animation and lighting effects came together to create something truly beautfiul.
I:28;151;The artwork is brillant and awe.
I:28;152;inspiring, the music is whimsical and vibrant, and the question posed by the film is one that humanity genuinely faces.
I:28;153;overall the movie is a marvelous experience, but you need to detach yourself from certain expectations.
I:28;154;I absolutely love this movie!
I:28;155;that said, I found Metropolis to be a wonderful film.
I:28;156;The music takes the form of great, jazzy mixes that empahisize life in the city.
I:28;157;The ending really packed a punch.
I:28;158;all in all, Metropolis is a good movie.
I:28;159;My friends said it was good, so I picked it up.
I:28;160;Metropolis's visual effects are vivid, lush, detailed.
I:28;161;The images, with a wonderful jazz soundtrack, create an atmosphere that is just this side of tactile.
I:28;162;OK, so the story isn't the most amazing I've seen, but it is solidly written.
I:28;163;I would recommend that you view it in the Japanese with subtitles.
I:28;164;I bought this film, understanding from the reviews that it would be the best Anime film I had seen since Akira.
I:28;165;The film Metropolis not only has the most breathtaking artwork but its story is complexe and entertaining.
I:28;166;A Must have for all anime fans.
I:28;167;Metropolis is a beautiful example of what Japanese animation can do when they are freed from the need to advertise toy products (Yes, the ever.
I:28;168;"present ""pokemon"" and the new ""Yu."
I:28;169;Its images both astound and fills the viewer with wonders of a city of tomorrow as depicted in the early and middle portions of the 20th century.
I:28;170;this is especially true of the scenes with the Ziggurat which hauntingly reminds a viewer of the Master's building in the earlier silent film.
I:28;171;The film also blends elements of another film.
I:28;172;This is a film very much worth viewing once and possibly owning.
I:28;173;There are so many words that could describe what I think of this movie, and one of the so many is.
I:28;174;far the top I have seen this year.
I:28;175;Over coming the famous Princess Mononoke, Metropolis is a brilliant animation that comes from the future of robots and destruction.
I:28;176;tech world of Metropolis, Duke Red is a powerful man with some plans to create a highly advanced robot by the name of: Tima.
I:28;177;Still, for what it does give, is worth having.
I:28;178;Metropolis is a gorgeously rendered futuristic world where robots and humans mingle, usually not without friction.
I:28;179;Unbeknownst to them both, Tima is a robot charged with human feelings, a super.
I:28;180;"and you have the complex film that is ""Metropolis."""
I:28;181;The jazz soundtrack is a brilliantly stylish, lending a retro feel to the movie despite its futuristic setting and plot.
I:28;182;Viewers will find themselves in a wholly imagined, distinctive realm that will astound them with its originality.
I:28;183;"above all, ""Metropolis"" is an art film, with its vision more significant than its plot."
I:28;184;Anime fans and art film lovers will find much to appreciate in this movie.
I:28;185;Osamu Tezuka's Metroplolis is a masterpiece, even if it is not the pace you like or not bloody enough for you it is still a grand piece of animation.
I:28;186;The audio is very crisp and I never found it off or crackling.
I:28;187;10/10 (for 5.1)Bonus Disc: It is good if you enjoy interviews and history and things of that sort, there are no games or real extravagant features.
I:28;188;The amusing features are multi.
I:28;189;angle views of production and a tiny art gallery.
I:28;190;There is the political betrayal, like Akira, a social uprising, also like Akira, and there is a chair used in symbolism and it is important near the end of the movie, hey Akira again!
I:28;191;This movie is a compelling drama that leaves you breathless.
I:28;192;The ending is so freaky, but amazing on how a small Japanease film can change anime.
I:28;193;That is the one and only truly compelling reason to see this movie.
I:28;194;The backdrop animation for this movie is simply stunning.
I:28;195;As a work of art this movie does wonderfully, creating a mechanized city that reminds me of the cities of Asimov, and Dark City.
I:28;196;This is one of those peculiar films that is at once challenging, stylish, and .
I:28;197;Here the city of Fritz Lang's Metropolis is given a jazzy, full.
I:28;198;paced story that is at once a classic anime romance and a fable about the consequences of human ambition.
I:28;199;But the real pleasure of the film is in its vividly imagined design, its consistently graceful movement, and its captivating palette.
I:28;200;Visually, Rintaro's Metropolis is every bit as smooth as its Dixieland soundtrack.
I:28;201;Its a feast for the eyes, and thankfully, there's a story to go with it.
I:28;202;I've watched this film twice, years apart, first with the English dub, then in Japanese with English subtitles.
I:28;203;Both times I came away feeling ambivalent.
I:28;204;The movie lacked heart and soul and a clear intent.
I:28;205;At times the pacing was a bit slow, but the jazzy, up tempo music kept things moving.
I:28;206;The story was merely mediocre, but the fantastic fusion of cgi and traditionaly anime animation more than made up for its shortcomings.
I:28;207;it is also typical of the film that we hear these lines over the most beautiful computer.
I:28;208;all I can say is that when films (both Eastern and Western) one day get stories that can compete with how good we can make the films look these days.
I:28;209;well, it'll be a new world.
I:28;210;The cell animation is great.
I:28;211;The computer animation is great.
I:28;212;As pointed out before, the characters are drawn in a style that went out.
I:28;213;And there are tremendous chase scenes and the climactic destruction at the end.
I:28;214;These are all impressive as an expression of the art and craft of animation.
I:28;215;Granted, Duke Red wants great power (not too sure why .
I:28;216;ichi and the robot girl look admiringly at one another, and they have a bit of adventure together, but what is the attraction between these two?
I:28;217;this is not great anime (like Miyazaki) nor is it particularly good cinema.
I:28;218;It is just unusual and that is what makes it interesting.
I:28;219;The characters look rounded like toys and even move a bit like toys.
I:28;220;The storyline is very relevant to the times, yet the visuals suggest the future and the music is very old (20s or 30s?)
I:28;221;I find that an interesting combination of present, past, and future in one animated film.
I:28;222;At one point in my life I was an unabashed otaku (huge fan of anime and manga) and I loved this movie.
I:28;223;After taking a break from anime, I came back to it and found.
I:28;224;This isn't just great anime, it's a great movie.
I:28;225;While the characters aren't exactly what most people think when they think anime, they work perfectly.
I:28;226;When the story gets incredibly dark, Kenichi is still a cute kid, which keeps you from losing all hope in humanity.
I:28;227;Another element that's pure genius is the jazz/big band soundtrack.
I:28;228;It's perfectly in synch with the movie, and never used gratuitously.
I:28;229;Good acting, the voices fit the characters, and the dialogue still works.
I:28;230;Over all, Metropolis is the perfect combination of apocalyptic story, great animation, and beautiful music.
I:28;231;i would recommend it to anyone that can stand the subtitles and can read fairly quickly.
I:28;232;the popeye style art of the characters is a little off puting at the begining, but likle all other things in this great anime.
I:28;233;without the subtle intricacies (misspelled, i know) there is a great plot here if you bother looking for it.3.
I:28;234;just listen to the part where Duke Red is going to the lab to see his daughter in the making.
I:28;235;now onto the greatness of this anime.1 the backgrounds: I was blown away.
I:28;236;"unlike normal movies, anime puts effort into the backgrounds it creates leaving you with a picture of a ""real"" world.2 charactres: a set of well developed characters like this bunch , makes the movie 10 times better than it would normaly be."
I:28;237;At some point it will remind you of felix the cat.
I:28;238;It is both beautiful and compelling.
I:28;239;Film noir, yet it is kept simple.
I:28;240;The interviews are interesting, overall.
I:28;241;a transported concept of a vision.
I:28;242;The extra features are good.
I:28;243;What's with the music, especially using a soulful, melancholy piece over a violent section of the film?Ahhh.
I:28;244;that's a homage to yet another old classic, Dr. Strangelove.
I:28;245;That's because for this film, the visuals are stunning.
I:28;246;the traditional cell animation characters over the CG backgrounds works well for the most part, and results in an amazing feast for the eyes.
I:28;247;humble opinion, we don't expect all movie stars to look like one particular actor, we shouldn't expect all cartoon characters to look the same either) then your eyes will be in for an enjoyable experience.
I:28;248;What's really nice though is the 30.
I:28;249;min special, which includes interviews, discussions of the animation techniques, and a few pictures of the original manga, allowing you to see the main differences in the two.
I:28;250;Take a chance, you'll probably enjoy it.
I:28;251;I don't quite think this movie should be compared to it at all because of the extreme difference in genres, but I would put this up with it as one of the best anime movies, or just movie in general, of all time.
I:28;252;But as always, the ending is what catches you by surprise.
I:28;253;Let's suffice to say, 'keep your mind open,' and I STRONGLY suggest this movie to absolutely anyone, anime fan or hater.
I:28;254;overall, metropolis is technicaly very impressive.
I:28;255;the music composed by Toshiyuki honda is splendid.
I:28;256;but, as an ensemble, it is a brilliant animated movie.
I:28;257;With its saturated colors and wonderful direction, Rintano and Otomo resurrect the brilliance of anime father Tezuka.
I:28;258;There are haunting themes about technology, the power of the state, and the power of militarist fascism.
I:28;259;Anyone with a decent knowledge of modern Japanese history will appreciate the subtle cues and resonances: the militarist's seizure of the government, the militarist's marriage with the Zaibatsu (special kind of Japanese business.
I:28;260;The backgrounds are simply stunning, the music wonderful, and I loved the robot detective.
I:28;261;Rock's and Tima's encounter, in which Rock walks around Tima, disorients the viewer, and captures the idea of who is the robot and who is the human?
I:28;262;A brilliant moment in any genre of film.
I:28;263;"first of all the whole ad campaign was of this amazing ""future metropolis"" but what's amazing about it?"
I:28;264;okay fine you say about how about as a movie?
I:28;265;I just wanted to see a good movie.
I:28;266;Every penny is worth it.
I:28;267;here is a summary of the movie:Duke Red creates a robot named Tima, and thanks to his son, Rock, he thinks Tima is destroyed.
I:28;268;Once in a blue moon you will be lucky enough to see and hear a movie this good.
I:28;269;Believe me, you'll become a fan of the genre after watching Metropolis.
I:28;270;The soundtrack is perfect, no matter what the critics say.
I:28;271;First of all, let me say that Katsuhiro Otomo is a genius.
I:28;272;the colors are stunning, the sound (5.1) is UNBELIEVABLE, and the computer animation blends smoothly with the cell (hand.
I:28;273;"Rintaro did an awesome job directing this film
I:28;274;And the most important thing of all, the story!
I:28;275;The plot is gripping and dramatic, while at the same time exciting and dishing out plenty of action.
I:28;276;Like so many others are beginning to belive, Metropolis may actually exceed Akira and take its place as the new classic in anime.
I:28;277;a few months ago I saw Metropolis in New York City.
I:28;278;The story is actually much more competent if you watch it two or three times.
I:28;279;A city being destroyed to Ray Charles' I Can't Stop Loving You is one of the most amazing sequences ever put onto film.
I:28;280;the main movie itself is also very good with a Jazz score and great action sequences with great sets and animation.
I:28;281;anime fans will be very satisfied with this film.
I:28;282;Suggested for ages 12 and up.
I:28;283;Metropolis is an astounding artistic achievement that exemplifies the incredible power of animation at its best.
I:28;284;nosed tyrant, Duke Red, has constructed an awesome weapon known as the Ziggurat.
I:28;285;He's hired genius robot designer, Dr. Laughton, to create the synthetic human masterpiece, Tima (voiced by Rebecca Forstadt, Minmei from Robotech).
I:28;286;Duke Red's unappreciated adoptive son, Rock (head of a gang of robot.
I:28;287;tinged streets of the many.
I:28;288;It all culminates in an unforgettable climax of emotion and chaos that ranks among the greatest scenes in cinematic history.
I:28;289;this movie combined beautiful 3.
I:28;290;The visuals are enough to make you want this.
I:28;291;the storyline is easy to follow for beginners and the characters are likeable, even Rock.
I:28;292;this movie will wow you with the look of it, and move you with the plot and end.
I:28;293;disc set is full of subtitled interviews and behind.
I:28;294;Watch the movie in Japanese with many subtitles for all nations or English.
I:28;295;i recommend this movie to all anime fans.
I:28;296;I thought the CGI was great!But one thing that was really remarkable to me was the traditionally painted backgrounds!!
I:28;297;They were the best i have ever seen, PERIOD!
I:28;298;The CGI in the backgrounds just enhanced it!!
I:28;299;A good, well directed, sci.
I:28;300;This is probably the best japanese animated sci.
I:28;301;drawn animation is excellent, and the story and characters are entertaining and interesting.
I:28;302;The film does an excellent job of presenting itself as a period piece with its selection of Jazzy music like St James Infirmiary, the art deco city scapes.
I:28;303;even the characters are drawn to the style of the period.
I:28;304;But it's an anachronistic period piece, and one that not only unfolds it's quick, but even.
I:28;305;tempo plot with consistantly high production values, but manages to place most of its emphasis on a social and political message.
I:28;306;The pairing was deliberate, and it was shocking, and it worked brilliantly.
I:28;307;The good parts of Fritz Lang's classic are present, but incredibly watered.
I:28;308;It should be noted, however, that the soundtrack is a lively collection of old jazz, blues, and swing tunes, and adds a very unique side to Metropolis .
I:28;309;probably its most outstanding feature.
I:28;310;while many of the backgrounds are rendered, the animation is far more fluid and traditional than other recent computer.
I:28;311;The characters are all animated with the traditional `super.
I:28;312;There are subtitles for the purists (and hard of hearing), of course, but the dub is pretty darn good.
I:28;313;In other words, you'll watch it once and forget about it.
I:28;314;It's one of those movies that grows on you, and you end up liking it despite its problems.
I:28;315;the story should make this work timeless.
I:28;316;and to be honest this story and story telling is far from timeless IMHO.
I:28;317;i had really high expectations for this one based on the reviews here.
I:28;318;the cover demonstrates a more contemporary style for characters.
I:28;319;but characters in the entire film have a very VERY retro look.
I:28;320;"up until now the best one I had seen was ""Princess Mononoke"", and it was tedious for a good twenty minutes right in the middle of the film."
I:28;321;i thought, watching it, that if someone made a live.
I:28;322;action version of this, shot for shot, it would undoubtedly be the highest grossing film in history, and probably take home the Best Picture Oscar.
I:28;323;however, a combination of tightly direction action (and repose), a script universal and yet human enough to make you genuinely care about these 2.
I:28;324;and some of the most amazing visuals ever juxtaposed on screen.
I:28;325;except, of course, that you will marvel that something so epic and detailed can go from an idea in a man's head, to a drawing, to the setting for a world that will make your seen your own in a new way.
I:28;326;And the lives it effects.
I:28;327;A love lost, a metropolis destroyed.
I:28;328;Truly one of the most innovative anime films in recent history.
I:28;329;It takes a tried and true sci.
I:28;330;fi premise and wraps it in the most spectacular visual package I've seen since Ghost in the Shell was first released.
I:28;331;Kenichi is one of those classic characters caught up in events much larger than himself.
I:28;332;I'm not sure if this is an anime remake of the original 1920's film Metropolis, but this is pretty sweet.
I:28;333;I would say the best part of this film are the visuals.
I:28;334;I did like it and will watch it again.
I:28;335;It is certainly leagues beyond the likes of Yu.
I:28;336;What you do have is a very old style of character design with excellent motion and color which I think is beautiful especially because of it's old look.
I:28;337;I think it works well with the computer animation.
I:28;338;For some reason the 1939 animated film Gulliver's Travel comes to mind.
I:28;339;The movement is not perfect but it is very well done.
I:28;340;The character most realized in terms of anime style is the female robot which is also deeply attached to a small radio.
I:28;341;The point is that this story can be taken on numerous levels and requires a thoughtful watching.
I:28;342;Personally, I don't know about the 1927 version made by Fritz Lang, but Ozamu Tezuka's adaptation of Metropolis seems to be quite outstanding.You want breathtaking visuals?
I:28;343;While it's nothing that you've probably never seen, the CGI used in this film does its job well, and the animation itself is beautiful.
I:28;344;is well organized and stays on course without skipping a beat.
I:28;345;Truly a classic tale re.
I:28;346;imagined, Metropolis is an anime film that's worth its weight in gold (or screws).
I:28;347;Its a wonderfull juxtaposition of complexity and simplicity.
I:28;348;Maybe a bit too simple as far as the story is concerned, but the wonderful characters more than make up for it.
I:28;349;Rich visuals and stunning animation.
I:28;350;really seamless intigration between hand drawn and computer anime styles.
I:28;351;The scoring is unique and fits the movie well, very moving in some parts.
I:28;352;Mostly, it's the overall identity of the movie I found most appealing and unique.
I:28;353;The depth and spirit of the universe created by the film.
I:28;354;This is a dated, but still beautiful additional example of this.
I:28;355;Very similar in scope and story line to the classic movie Akira, except it deals with more with robots and their future, than with the evolution of humanity.
I:28;356;Its brillant color and mixture of retro.
I:28;357;kiddy character designs and CGI graphics make it an undeniable work of art.
I:28;358;The visuals are, to say the least, intense for the eyes.
I:28;359;the movie starts at a large banquet in the city of Metropolis.
I:28;360;Anyway numerous elements collide, and thought.
I:28;361;like friend/enemy who is a perfectly designed android.
I:28;362;The jazzy songs that accompany the movie are appropriate to help create the retro.
I:28;363;And along with the numerous memorable characters the movie is sealed almost perfectly at the seams.
I:28;364;Rock was my favorite character, his psychosis, hate of robots, love for his father, and unshakeable determination and sacrifice make him the most memorable of all the wonderful characters in Metropolis.
I:28;365;Anyway I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:28;366;(Especially fans of Blade Runner and Akira) Enjoy the eye.
I:28;367;candy and I challenge you to try to answer some of the questions Metropolis raises.
I:28;368;First of all, this anime has almost nothing to do with the Fritz Lang masterpiece by the same name: I understand that the Japanese version was inspired by seeing a poster of the German classic.
I:28;369;Indeed, I think the anime stands remarkably well on it's own.
I:28;370;"In fact, Detective Shunsaku bears an eerie resemblance to Rich Uncle Moneybags from ""Monopoly."""
I:28;371;These nostalgic visuals are augmented with vintage 1920's jazz music.
I:28;372;the cell are is seamlessly overlaid on dazzling computer graphics.
I:28;373;It is pure eye candy.
I:28;374;the story was lush and layered.
I:28;375;this story is very engaging and thought provoking.
I:28;376;With the exception of the last five minutes, it was executed very well.
I:28;377;As with all anime, there is much detail given to the sub.
I:28;378;You feel like you are given a thicker, heavier story that is all the more satisfying.
I:28;379;"It is great fodder for fans of Joseph Campbell and ""The Hero with 1,000 Faces."""
I:28;380;But this fantasy core to sci.
I:28;381;fi is what makes it so exciting.
I:28;382;This is the best anime I have ever seen.
I:28;383;A strange mix of high and cutesy take this animated feature into uncharted territories.
I:28;384;Childhood innocence hits a wall of cynicism and war in this breathtakingly beautiful, animated feature from Japan.
I:28;385;This is not for everyone, but if you like Final Fantasy, Blade Runner or the Wizard of Oz, you may very well love this.
I:28;386;There's something about twisted super.
I:28;387;"my inhibitions of anime aside, ""Metropolis"" is unlike the gloom and doom post."
I:28;388;"what ""Metropolis"" achieves is a very intricate story that works provided your comprehension is willing to work with it."
I:28;389;Metropolis desires more than just knock us over with it's superb combination of 2D and computer generated imagery, but it aspires to integrate a story within that world.
I:28;390;"The best part about the story of ""Metropolis"" is it actually has a semi."
I:28;391;Yes, the city is in ruins, but there's hope, and where there is hope, there's, at least, a happy ending.
I:28;392;"Metropolis also sports an enjoyable, and interesting soundtrack, using American jazz, Dixieland, and Ray Charles' ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" during the climactic sequence of the film, reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove""'s use of ""We'll Meet Again"" sequence."
I:28;393;"loosely drawn from Fritz Lang's 1925 silent film ""Metropolis"", ""Metropolis"" is truly a stunning achievement in anime."
I:28;394;I was wholly entertained, and satisfied that I let my critical disdain for anime fall so I could enjoy this truly remarkable animated feature.
I:28;395;for the price, it is a great deal!!
I:28;396;metropolis is a very well.
I:28;397;done film, and you can tell that the animators went to great lengths to preserve Osamu Tezuka's original character designs.
I:28;398;The soundtrack for the film (which sounds a lot like New Orleans jazz) really helps evoke a certain ambience to the film.
I:28;399;And I think this melding of the past with the future really adds a layer to this film.
I:28;400;the audience who would have the greatest appreciation for the film would be older teenagers and adults.
I:28;401;The movie is extremely clear about the difference between sharp.
I:28;402;this is a movie about contrasts in many ways, and the graphics are just the start.
I:28;403;You have the human workers both cared for by and upset with the very.
I:28;404;The humans up above have the life of art deco, elegance and ease, with a great, jazz.
I:28;405;in the midst of all of this comes a very human tale of love and hate.
I:28;406;Rock is the adopted son of Duke Red, head of the Marduk faction.
I:28;407;all Rock wants is the Duke's love, and dutifully does his job of killing out.
I:28;408;The PI, a classic 30s detective a la Philip Marlowe, brings along his nephew, Kenichi, to help out.
I:28;409;Kenichi hooks up with the cyborg, Tema.
I:28;410;the movie has vaulting ambitions and a lot of ground to cover.
I:28;411;Tema gets shot in the heart, and looks sadly at the hole that should have held her soul and life.
I:28;412;it's an ambitious experiment, and on many levels it will serve as a model and inspiration for years to come.
I:28;413;But the characters are extremely one.
I:28;414;It aimed to be a stellar work of art, and even with its flaws, it still will inspire artists for years to come.
I:28;415;This movie is on my top favorites, it has some of the most captivating scenes and the story is great too.
I:28;416;Have loved the film for a long time.
I:28;417;A great addition to my collection.
I:28;418;The extras were very informative and I learned a great deal more about the entire project.
I:28;419;I'd say though that the major achievement of the designers was to portray the robot girl so beautifully, which was essential for the movie itself.
I:28;420;oh great), the picture (Tima staring up into radiant light .
I:28;421;"lucky break for me: ""Metropolis"" is wonderful."
I:28;422;"I fully anticipated ""Metropolis"" would fall into the latter, but found myself so hypnotized by the images, so entranced by the characters, that I couldn't stop watching."
I:28;423;for starters it looks spectacular.
I:28;424;"Director Rintaro uses cityscapes and architecture, and describes scale like no one since ""Akira"" ."
I:28;425;Every shot is beautifully multi.
I:28;426;Still, a more than worthy effort.
I:28;427;"but while ""Metropolis"" is clearly a demonstration of Rintaro's respect for ""Akira"", it is also a tour."
I:28;428;force of his own talents as a director of characters (his career dates back to Astroboy!)
I:28;429;: the characters and their animation are irresistible.
I:28;430;cute characters with an unsentimental delivery.
I:28;431;Most interesting is the non.
I:28;432;the glances and smiles between characters.
I:28;433;and it's the characters that will keep you watching.
I:28;434;the level of destruction is right up there with Akira, and anyone sensitive the sight of collapsing buildings (post 9.11 etc.) should definitely think twice about this one.
I:28;435;"Also the body count is quite high, but mainly among the ""mechanical"" robots (probably dodging a censorship rating problem here) ."
I:28;436;Nothing special, but a must for aficionados.
I:28;437;Metropolis, if you didn't already guess, steals several major elements from the Fritz Lang classic .
I:28;438;Come on people, give credit where it's due!
I:28;439;ironically enough, Metropolis (when it was published in 1947) is set in the year 2000.
I:28;440;what I love the best about Metropolis is that it sticks extremely close to Osamu Tezuka's original designs while at the same time successfully combining it with CG and fluid animation.
I:28;441;And since it has been five years in the making, you know it is going to look good.
I:28;442;One of the main points about Metropolis is the heavy detail.
I:28;443;Everything is highly detailed from people to blimbs to trains to cars are all successfully combined to make the cityscape easy to get use to.
I:28;444;Notice how Kenichi is played by the same guy who does the voice of Jim Hawking on Outlaw Star and that Tima's voice actress use to do the voice of Minmei on Robotech.
I:28;445;Everything is here from production designs, animation comparisons, history of the comic, biographies, featurette and interviews.
I:28;446;overall, Metropolis is a great film that can be enjoyed by all ages.
I:28;447;Highly recommended for all audiances even if they don't have any knowledge of the comic at all.
I:28;448;"I came to this film with very high expectations
I:28;449;It has beauty, power, mystery, and above all.
I:28;450;Images from this movie will stay with you forever.
I:28;451;This is probably the greatest anime flick ever, but I would be curious to know how people who have seen both Metropolis and the recent Final Fantasy movie recently would compare them.
I:28;452;but the level of detail and the realism of the sets and backgrounds in Final Fantasy exceeded, to my mind, what was done in Metropolis.
I:28;453;that having been said, I still think Metropolis is a very visually appealing and even stunning animated movie and well worth seeing, even if you're not into anime or animation in general.
I:28;454;a picture of the characters after the end of the anime.
I:28;455;who was to become the world's best.
I:28;456;Sharp class differences also contribute to the tensions of a world largely in the hands of the power hungry.
I:28;457;we find Metropolis in the throes of a celebration.
I:28;458;Duke Red has completed the Ziggurat, an immensely tall building whose central tower conceals a solar weapon that will make the city the capital of the world, and Duke Red its ruler.
I:28;459;The intricate politics of Metropolis are based on three tiers .
I:28;460;the upper class, a vast and impoverished lower class, and beneath all else, the robots.
I:28;461;There is great conflict over the role of the robots.
I:28;462;The resulting conflagration catapults Kenichi and Tima into a wild race for life with Rock right behind them.
I:28;463;On the way, we get to see much of Metropolis's underground, bringing home the social message.
I:28;464;Tima, who does not know she is not human, finds she is capable of wonder, love, and fear.
I:28;465;not only is the artwork remarkable, but this is an exquisite piece of animation, smoothly combining CGI and two.
I:28;466;An agile eye will pick up new details on each watching.
I:28;467;Toshiyuki Honda's music is equally satisfying.
I:28;468;It is interesting that Tezuka refused to have this story made into a film during his life.
I:28;469;If you like a happy.
I:28;470;his art takes some time to get used to, but after awhile, you really do appreciate the originality in his characters.
I:28;471;boy villian at first glance, but you realize his love for his father and Metropolis after about half an hour of watching the scenes.
I:28;472;There's alot of gunshots, some rather disturbing scenes in which Tima loses her human skin coverage, and Rock just goes wild with the gun.
I:28;473;the art is amazing, but the music.
I:28;474;"i'm not a big fan of jazz and blues, but the ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" song when Ziggarut crumbles down is totally ironic, and it's actually amazing on how it adds to the moods."
I:28;475;I give it 2 1/2 to 3 stars, and say it's really only worth seeing for the visuals.
I:28;476;Amazing, stunning and oh so beautiful.
I:28;477;Whit a good story and retro futurisic look makes this anime one of the best ever made.
I:28;478;If you somehow have missed it I highly recommed that you go and see it.
I:28;479;And a little about the plot:It takes place in the city Metropolis in some future.
I:28;480;see it is all I can say!
I:28;481;He's done things I absolutely adore, like BlackJack, things I like, such as Astroboy, and things I don't care much for, like Adolf.
I:28;482;And just how do you modernize a 1949 manga for a modern, technically savvy audience?Well, you start by bringing in anime and manga heavyweights such as Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro.
I:28;483;Then you add opulent character and scenery design, lush animation and a healthy dose of cutting edge CGI.
I:28;484;Finish it off with a far ranging and highly eclectic soundtrack and you've got Metropolis.
I:28;485;this film is driven by duality.
I:28;486;modern style, blending elements of art deco with futuristic technology.
I:28;487;The human characters are highly emotional, a feat not always accomplished in animation, matched by the robots who are (for the most part) cold and emotionless.
I:28;488;These are all powerful elements that work well within the framework of the story.
I:28;489;I felt that sometimes the visuals overpowered the storyline.
I:28;490;I'm not always a fan of CGI, but for the most part it blended well with the traditional animation.
I:28;491;the Ray Charles song made my friend and I look at each other with giant question marks over our heads, but it was actually quite a powerful statement.
I:28;492;I really enjoyed the film and, if this tells you anything, my friend did too.
I:28;493;Try to catch it on the big screen.
I:28;494;The action sequences are spaced out which causes there to be a few slow spots but the experience is worth the wait.
I:28;495;"The animation isn't as graphic as ""Akira"", but the directing and the music makes it a visual treat."
I:28;496;the director Rintaro sticks more to the visuals than to the characters but he stays with the plot and it still turns out great.
I:28;497;And above all this is a sacred story of love.
I:28;498;It has beauty, power, mystery, and above all.
I:28;499;Images from this film will stay with you forever.
I:28;500;I recommend this film to anybody.
I:28;501;It has the feel of the oldies, yet the characters move so fluidly it's amazing.
I:28;502;This beautiful blend of animation and 3.
I:28;503;d computer animation is astounding.
I:28;504;the characters, the story, the action will thrill you.
I:28;505;I actually liked the animation and found that the two styles complimented each other nicely.
I:28;506;Similarly, I thought that the music also complimented the film well.
I:28;507;I felt the film provided a good message of identity and to a lesser extent, social classes.
I:28;508;Awesome movie, great visuals and color.
I:28;509;I was a bit surprised.
I:28;510;But generally all the packaging and discs are attractive and functional.
I:28;511;But I've heard very good things, so I'll give it a 5.
I:28;512;The ending was typical of an anime, not entirely satisfying.
I:28;513;Generally, if you like anime, and good visuals you'll like this movie.
I:28;514;But still, it's a decent flick.
I:28;515;Haven't watched the special features yet, but I assume they'll be decent and on par with other movie/anime special features.
I:28;516;"While watching this movie, I kept finding myself saying ""wow"" over and over."
I:28;517;The visuals for this movie are top.
I:28;518;the real pull of this movie is how attached the viewer becomes to the characters.
I:28;519;in terms of a great movie, this one is a winner.
I:28;520;It is an emotional piece that hits all the buttons other movies similar in idea(A. i. for instance) missed.
I:28;521;Metropolis is definitely very impressive.
I:28;522;The visual looks extremely rich and beautiful.
I:28;523;Each fame is composed very carefully.
I:28;524;The world and character designs are excellent.
I:28;525;But nonetheless, this film is worth the 5 stars for its artistic achievement and effort.
I:28;526;Metropolis is rich in both visual and creativity.
I:28;527;the manga Metropolis, and the movie based on it, is a protest against such thinking.
I:28;528;The heart of the city should be the human heart, with all the flaws and merits that goes with it.
I:28;529;I liked the supplimental materials, which explains some of the important thoughts and events during the production, including coments and interviews from the directors, staff members, and casts.
I:28;530;Of course, the story itself was also great and interesting.
I:28;531;Just step in or hop on to some exciting ride or adventure of a life time.
I:28;532;the film's story has been brought up again and again, so I won't go into it that much.
I:28;533;characters are something to gleam over as well.
I:28;534;This can be credited not only to the superb animation, but also to the very talented JAPANESE (not English) voice cast.
I:28;535;It is very easy to fall in love with all of these characters.
I:28;536;A rarity even in Disney movies.
I:28;537;the animation is the real star of the show.
I:28;538;Blanding extraordinary CGI and traditional Tezuka.
I:28;539;style characters, the artwork teems with both powerful and simple energy that radiates from ever cell of animation.
I:28;540;i don't know, vivid, alive, real.
I:28;541;land Jazz played in the background and foreground throughout the entire film.
I:28;542;It captures just about everything in the movie.
I:28;543;There, I said my piece.
I:28;544;Akira meets Metropolis meets James Bond, opulently filmed with lotsa of very fine art deco Hugh Ferris / Schuiten.
I:28;545;peeters inspired urban skyscraper landscape rendering.
I:28;546;stylish (perhaps precisely because it was incomprehensible?)
I:28;547;watch meriting precisely ONE watch.
I:28;548;This movie was really cool.
I:28;549;The characters were very well developed.
I:28;550;I would reccomend you see it.
I:28;551;But it works in this film.
I:28;552;When it's done right you get an absolutely amazing work of art.
I:28;553;The visuals in this movie are unparalleled by any animated movie I've seen.
I:28;554;And that includes Sherk and all the other computer animated movies.
I:28;555;The art in this movie is just beautiful and will leave your jaw on the floor.
I:28;556;The story works almost like a video game.
I:28;557;The story is strong, the characters add to the story and the art.
I:28;558;Knowing previous Osamu Tezuka works, and being a fan of Taro Rin, the director behind classics as Galaxy Express 999, Adieu Galaxy Express 999 and X, I was both excited and afraid to watch this movie.
I:28;559;for sound, this movie is excellent, sound effects and music are well chosen (no matter what they say about the music on the last scene, it's got everything for the characters situation at that point).
I:28;560;The plot, while not extraordinary, is nicely arranged and builds a large background to keep everything just on the right place.
I:28;561;less.You may be impressed by the imagery, by the simple but yet attractive plot, or you will watch this simply for the chance of checking this classical Osamu Tezuka work.
I:28;562;Either way, you are in for a treat.
I:28;563;realistic, the styles chosen are deliberate and invoke specific contrasts.
I:28;564;"in conclusion, this movie is just saturated in AMAZING visuals and great jazzy music (I couldn't think of a more appropriate use of ""I cant stop loving you"" by Ray Charles at the end), and it contains a story of a search for a 'self' within the fantastical world of Metropolis."
I:28;565;A must see, for movie fans with open eyes.
I:28;566;There's a lot going on in this film.
I:28;567;This movie is truly one of the best.
I:28;568;Not THE best but one of the best anime and animated film out there.
I:28;569;The cinematography in this film is amazing, and myself, hoping to be a director, can only hope to mimic the angles used.
I:28;570;animation is crisp and clear, with bright, cheerful colors used when the movie is 'happy' and dark, morose colors used when it turns 'sad'.
I:28;571;As always, their meeting signifies the rising action, until the climax occurs which is what I think the best point in the film.
I:28;572;It works, It oddly works.
I:28;573;I was pleasantly surprised by the dub, and I personally like it more than the sub.
I:28;574;overall this is a solid release and worthy of both anime and movie collectors.
I:28;575;Visually this is one impressive movie.
I:28;576;What's produced is a story about the struggle between humanity and itself, humanity and technology and an inner struggle of the heart.
I:28;577;the Red Duke reigns over the city and has created a powerful robotic entity who far superseedes the ordinary clunky robots.
I:28;578;A good, but not great story.
I:28;579;The use of CGI to generate the cold and towering city skyline is an interesting contrast to Tezuka's old.
I:28;580;First of all, let me say that the animation was wonderful.
I:28;581;generated animation, but I feel it was used to great effect in this movie.
I:28;582;In addition to the animation, I liked the special features that were bundled with the movie.
I:28;583;For these two reasons it gets two stars.
I:28;584;It seemed to me that the most well developed character was Rock, who was intended to be third.
I:28;585;And while (as all seasoned anime fans know) it is unreasonable to expect a happy ending, I was expecting at least SOME resolution.
I:28;586;Metropolis is a touching sci.
I:28;587;the animation has a very Disney.
I:28;588;This is a great title for pre.
I:28;589;It's a shame anime wouldn't be considered for best film or script in a film festival because this is an amazing work.
I:28;590;"There are some very intense situations
I:28;591;"It was entitled ""Osamu Tezuka: 40 years of cartoons"" and though it was a modest volume (both in size and page count) it was packed with dazziling color illustrations by Osamu Tezuka, the most important pioneer of Japanese comics."
I:28;592;Over the last 15+ years I have marvelled at the beauty of the artwork and the creative vision behind it.
I:28;593;"returning to the present
I:28;594;It is a remarkable snapshot of Tezuka's world, a dazzling future universe, where 50s automobiles co. exist with super science, where robots fight oppression and discrimination, where androids have souls, all executed with brilliant color and stylistically simple presentation, reminiscent of 1930s animated cartoons.
I:28;595;Hopefully the release of this film, and several other projects in print and film will gain Tezuka the recognition in the US which he so richly deserves.
I:28;596;I fancy myself an artist, and even with the Astro Boy.
I:28;597;"The ""Metropolis"" story has a great amount of real life history worth while for anyone who enjoys dabbling into details more than just watching."
I:28;598;as an animated movie by itself, absolutely supurb!
I:28;599;Very true to the style and characteristics you would expect from the original written story Metropolis, presented in a very Japanese and culturally accurate plot to modern times, and despite being dated the CGI and other graphics are extremely well made even by today's standards in CGI.
I:28;600;The music of choice by Toshiyuki Honda is perfect in creating a very authentic New Orleans style of jazz/rag.
I:28;601;But there are times when I come across something made so well it becomes an instant classic and to me this is one of them.
I:28;602;I love animated films and I was looking forward to it when it was released, after some searching over here I got it, sat down and was never more bored.
I:28;603;But if you actually sit down and watch the film without cultural baggage you will be pleasantly surprised.
I:28;604;There is a story here.
I:28;605;I was not sure what this film was about, so I love Japanese Animated Movie .
I:28;606;So taking a Chance, I bought it and justgot through watching it!
I:28;607;This disc had *great* animation and was truly fun to watch!From the fireworks going off to the spectacular ending of this Movie .
I:28;608;stunningly detailed and literally breathtaking .
I:28;609;yes, you will actually gasp in awe .
I:28;610;director Rintaro lifts scenes, ideas and elements (or is it an homage?)
I:28;611;Even if the story is sometimes convoluted and hard to follow, the fabulous images make this something worth seeing.
I:28;612;"A second mini disc includes an animax special making of ""Metropolis,"" interviews, concept art and much more."
I:28;613;This is my favorite film of all time, so I was wondering what people who gave it one star would have to say.
I:28;614;There is a simple and reasonable explanation.
I:28;615;The animation style mimics his artwork, giving it a retro feel.
I:28;616;You shouldn't expect anything too original, but this film delivers a storyline that is similar to many others, but better.
I:28;617;This is a brilliant film with no flaws.
I:28;618;In the end it was kind of sad seeing Tima the android had fallen and died she was very nice and love the boy name Kenichi.
I:28;619;the second first started watching Metropolis I was very impressed and intruigued, and as the story unfolded and I started to know the charactors it got better and better and kept on going up in quolity.
I:28;620;It keeps you interested and wandering what could happen next.
I:28;621;The cute and curious female lead in this.
I:28;622;has a sort of air about her that just makes you love her charactor right away.
I:28;623;ichi and his detective uncle, a great team that is actually seperated most of the movie.
I:28;624;And there are the robots the cool sweet innocent beings that help out our freinds on their journey.
I:28;625;The animation is sort of a tribute to early anime which gives it a really cool feel and view.
I:28;626;I watch alot of movies and alot of anime and I know a great anime when I see one and this IS a great movie, not just in the anime genra, it's a great movie.
I:28;627;this will bring a whole new era of anime but i doubt any of it will be much better than this wonderful film.
I:28;628;faceted artwork of the dystopian big city backdrop.
I:28;629;Then I bought it when I got a better LED TV.
I:28;630;Metropolis is one of the more interesting animes I have seen, and I was very pleased that it was made.
I:28;631;It basically has an Astro Boy look to it.
I:28;632;the story is well done, with a screenplay by Akira's Katsuhiro Otomo.
I:28;633;"It's basically the ""man vs. robot"" theme we have seen many times before, but it's executed quite well here."
I:28;634;The characters are interesting and relatable, and the world is quite beautiful and fleshed out.
I:28;635;it also has a moving ending, which was quite unique, due to the odd choice of music played throughout the climax(you'll see).
I:28;636;metropolis is one of the last animes that really impressed me, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves animation with a mature story, and not a bunch of melodrama and flash.
I:28;637;I'm a big fan of anime, to the point of geekyness without being a geek, and i just wanted to check it out.
I:28;638;Metropolis is def on the top of my list.
I:28;639;Many of the scenes and characters are directly influenced by Akira and X.
I:28;640;Who knows maybe Metropolis will slowly develop a cult following.
I:28;641;Most people say, I've seen it before, but this particular version is def better than any other.
I:28;642;Even though at times it seems that it is a little crazy you always know its perfect for the moment.
I:28;643;Maybe I like it because of my love for modern art.
I:28;644;The Metropolis Osamu Tezuka's film, is a fresh updated version, while giving a heavy nod to the old one.
I:28;645;She is brought into the fold of the workers, and she gets to see the under belly of a revolution.
I:28;646;Her best friend Rock is trying to help.
I:28;647;great movie, it's anime is tight, the plot is engaging.
I:28;648;The animation is smooth, great colors, and the voice acting is wonderful.
I:28;649;I have seen this movie many times and will see it again, every time I notice something new.
I:28;650;It is a wonderful nod to the original but stands on its own, both are loved by me.
I:28;651;I never thought it could happen, but it looks like an anime movie has finally taken Akira's place as the greatest anime film in history!
I:28;652;the best of the best were all combined to make this film and did a truly fantastic job!
I:28;653;the characters in this film are all very well developed unlike many other anime films.
I:28;654;you feel their emotion and really get into the story.
I:28;655;fi films including Blade Runner Akira and of coarse, the 1929 films Metropolis which is not anyway close to the solid plot of this film.
I:28;656;anyway, I cant really say much more about this movie here because this film is so great no review can do it justice!
I:28;657;just go out there and see this movie!
I:28;658;its a work of art!
I:28;659;The animation is beautiful, the voice.
I:28;660;acting is done well, and the story makes sense.
I:28;661;Very beautiful and worth it!If you love robots this movie is good, but if you enjoy the beauty of old school anime styles and the fluidity of the animation then you will appreciate this movie more than you can imagine!I don't want to spoil much but this movie is definitely something you should watch at least once!
I:28;662;filmed after his death, and against his expressed wishes, this film is dazzling and beautiful beyond belief.
I:28;663;Using both standard cell and CGI animation combined, the director, Rintaro, and his crew have put together one of the most stunning animated films ever released.
I:28;664;metropolis the film is a marvel of beauty and imagination, unbelievable in it's scale and detail.
I:28;665;the film opens with a powerful and corrupt mogul by the name of Duke Red presiding over a massive celebration to mark the completion of his mammoth art deco.
I:28;666;there are a variety of stories going on here, and a multitude of positive and negative relationships between the various characters (as well as the divergent classes), all of which lead this story to it's final climax.
I:28;667;building on a script by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) and the technical skills of many traditional and computer animators, Rintaro has created a world that will be recognizable to anyone familiar with either the original Fritz Lang film (1927) or the world of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), and yet still startling in it's level of detail and the verve of it's animation techniques.
I:28;668;If you are familiar with Akira the movie this picture's ending is similar in theme and visuals.
I:28;669;The Duke Red was drawn with one of the largest noses I've ever seen.
I:28;670;It was beautiful to watch and had a cool plot.
I:28;671;I thought it was sooooooooo cool!
I:28;672;First of all i absolutely fell in love with the music!
I:28;673;the backround was so detailed and realistic.
I:28;674;i thought they did a good job of mixing cgi with reagualr 2d.
I:28;675;If you don't like the movie then at least get the soundtrack cause it's so totally cool!
I:28;676;"The animation in this film could be the best I have ever seen
I:28;677;the lighting and shading, the color pallette, as well as the three point perspective was spectacular.
I:28;678;The best I have ever seen.
I:28;679;I also liked the fact that the people in the backgrounds were not static drawings but rather they were animated as well.
I:28;680;(There's a million stories in Metropolis so to speak.)
I:28;681;Everything contained in Metropolis is profoundly well executed yet at times it falls short since some of the elements such as the music, character design, and back ground art don't always integrate together.
I:28;682;for Example: The character design is very anime, retro which I liked.
I:28;683;It was very stylized and fun.
I:28;684;it was amusing at times with its main emphasis on the majestic scenery just like in a silent movie.
I:28;685;Nonetheless, it was very well orchestrated and performed.
I:28;686;bLOOIE Story wise I loved it all the way till the third act.
I:28;687;I also wanted the character to survive.
I:28;688;so what you have is a movie that is breathtaking to look at.
I:28;689;However there is a lot to love and admire about Metropolis and it is well worth putting in your library if you appreciate fine art in animation.
I:28;690;Beautiful animation, this film is in a catagory all its own.
I:28;691;The scenery and characters look great.
I:28;692;There are some throw backs to Akira and Metropolis, but it is an amazing visual experience to watch this film.
I:28;693;notice I said an amazing VISUAL experience.
I:28;694;5 stars is bold, so I'll give a reason for each star.1 LOOK.
I:28;695;"beautiful ART, COLOR, and CGI work2 STYLE
I:28;696;breaking, it holds its own and has the basic elements of a mystery / romance / adventure film.
I:28;697;"This is where Metropolis really shines
I:28;698;type anime films (Serial Experiments Lain) and Metropolis certainly delivers.
I:28;699;To me special effects are always secondary to a film, and while this movie certainly has more obvious weight in the effects department, it uses them tastefully with style and grace.
I:28;700;They come to life and the story does the rest.
I:28;701;I enjoyed and brought it home to watch the next day.
I:28;702;this movie has an excellent story, a bit similar to Spielberg's underrated flick A. i.: Artificial Intelligence , great jazzy music, and suberb, fluid animation.
I:28;703;The reviews on this tend to get a bit gabby about spoilers, so I'll keep it as unrevealing as possible.
I:28;704;metropolis is a huge city, where robots and people live together, until a man named Duke Red builds a huge tower called the Ziggurat and forces the robots to live underground and serve the people.
I:28;705;Sounds allot like Astroboy to me whose job is to bring peace between humans and robots as a mighty peace ruler when you watch the 2004 anime series of Astroboy.
I:28;706;"the story is very good and more or less asks the question
I:28;707;the animation alone is well worth the price of admission and it still has a good story plot, though not new.
I:28;708;The best Anime is completely origonal, and to say that this is anything less is an understatement.
I:28;709;It is however a deep emotional story that a US Studio would never even think about producing.
I:28;710;I'm one of those people who liked it.
I:28;711;There's always something going on in the background to make it look interesting.
I:28;712;The designs are a throwback to Osamu Tezuka, the original creator of the Metropolis manga.
I:28;713;The character designs look and feel like his work.
I:28;714;Yes, it is a shock, but I now think that Duke Red's nose actually suits him quite nicely.
I:28;715;It's brilliant and eye catching!
I:28;716;I gotta tell you, when I saw the blimp in the beginning, I felt like I was there!
I:28;717;4) Voice: The voice acting for the English version was very believable, and in my opinion better than the original.
I:28;718;All of the emotions were there, from Tima to Rock, even the robot sounded great!
I:28;719;"Even though it didn't fit the overall feel of the movie, though, I felt it fit some scenes well, such as the final scene where the music played ""I Can't Stop Loving You""."
I:28;720;You know something's good if James Cameron himself compliments it.
I:28;721;XDOverall, I thought this movie was well made.
I:28;722;Sure it has it's moments, but it's good parts outshine all the rest!
I:28;723;no.1:Metropolis is the greatest movie of all time!
I:28;724;A detective and his nephew (Ke.
I:28;725;cool,smooth talkin' (and lookin'),young(and attractive)sharp shootin'.
I:28;726;inchi.Young,funny,smart,boy who plays the hero,and is the nephew of.
I:28;727;a funny guy who never pays for his lunch.
I:28;728;(and the the street fender owner always is a big hunkey strong guy.)
I:28;729;This is a very intersting piece.
I:28;730;cool story, inapropriate music for the emotions.
I:28;731;An exquisitely designed, well written fantasy.
I:28;732;The animation is beautifully done, and the combination of CGI and conventional animation is most effective.
I:28;733;the backgrounds and general design are fascinatingly brought to life.
I:28;734;The animation, the characters, the plot (while nothing entirely NEW, is expertly accomplished), and the music are some of the best I have ever witnessed in any film, whether it be Live.
I:28;735;Not only a masterpiece in anime or animated film, but a masterpiece in cinema in general.
I:28;736;This movie is visually stunning and perfect in all it's elements!
I:28;737;do yourself a favor and check out the original silent metropolis.
I:28;738;I'm not much into Manga but this movie is a good addition to your collection if you like science fiction/fantasy.
I:28;739;the artistry in this film is amazing.
I:28;740;It's kind of a punk noir .
I:28;741;Surprisingly most of the signs in the film are in English.
I:28;742;give it a go if you like this genre, it's worth it.
I:28;743;wOW, the animation is so great sometimes you'll forget about the characters.
I:28;744;Instead we have this very deep and very powerful Pinnochio style story set in the deep future.
I:28;745;Highly recomended for all viewers.
I:28;746;Metropolis, based on the magna by Teszuki, is a very memborable and touching anime.
I:28;747;Set in a big city with underground chambers, the graphics are very spectacular.
I:28;748;The use of CG and cell brings upon a breath taking array of visuals.
I:28;749;Watching this movie you can clearly see why it took 5 years to make.
I:28;750;The music in the movie is absolutely spectacular.
I:28;751;Comming with a 50's New Orleans jazz feel, the score mixes in very well with the atmosphere and emotions of the movie.
I:28;752;"The use of the late Ray Charles ""I can't stop loving you"" in the final scenes of the movie is brilliant because it fits in with the themes of not being able to let go of love."
I:28;753;All in all metropolis is a excellent movie which will stay in your mind for a long time.
I:28;754;The ending is absolutely heartbreaking also.
I:28;755;i recommend this movie to any anime fan and anyone who is a big movie fan.
I:28;756;I waited for what seemed like years to see this movie but when I finally did see it, it lived up to all expectations.
I:28;757;aNIMATION:10/10: It's a mix between anime a fifties cartoon and computer graphics.
I:28;758;I personally thought they blended very well.
I:28;759;The dubbing is actually quite good.
I:28;760;cHARACTERS:9/10: Metropolis has realistic lovable characters that wear cool clothes.
I:28;761;Metropolis is a must see and a must own.
I:28;762;This is a good anima, if you liked Akira, you will most defenite love this!
I:28;763;This movie is a delight!
I:28;764;I admit, I watch most videos with only half my attention while doing something else.
I:28;765;The backgrounds in this animation rich and varied.
I:28;766;sized gears, catch the early.
I:28;767;industrial mood of Lang's Metropolis .
I:28;768;deco esthetic with monumental symmetries, or tech.
I:28;769;They create unique moods for each passage, and are the distinctive strength of this movie.
I:28;770;The action is well paced and the script follows its own rules.
I:28;771;Earth is saved in the end, as usual.
I:28;772;I'll watch it again, if only for the backgrounds.
I:28;773;And that's a good thing, because for all its stunning animation, this flick is really hard to follow.
I:28;774;You should be able to take it from there.
I:28;775;Scenes and action skips around a great deal, leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks as to what must have happened in the interim.
I:28;776;on the other hand, a lot of the animations were completely stunning.
I:28;777;The music was a beautiful blend of old jazz, blues, and a few soul numbers that made a moving contrast to the futuristic setting, and the synchronicity of the music and visuals was particularly well done.
I:28;778;see this film if you're a fan of the genre, but don't expect too much.
I:28;779;This is a must for animators and fans of animation in general.
I:28;780;It shows the true nature of the human heart and the robotic soul , free will, destiny, love, liberty, and even the deepest depths of what we call mind are called into play into one of the most epic adventures ever.
I:28;781;This one is a one for future generations to learn from, so as to know thoughts on unity, peace, and loss.
I:28;782;When I first saw Metropolis I was skeptical of how good it really was.
I:28;783;the story and background of the movie is pretty commonplace and stable.
I:28;784;they are integrated into the movie seamlessly.)
I:28;785;All I can say is wow.
I:28;786;Metropolis is a great film, and and one of the best theatrical animations I have seen.
I:28;787;There is a perfect blend of story, music, technical achievement and visual style.
I:28;788;"fundamentally, ""Metropolis"" is all about juxtaposition of style."
I:28;789;The blend of Tezuka's heavily cartoonish characters and the highly detailed backgrounds creates a fully.
I:28;790;The Cel animation fits seemlessly with the CGI.
I:28;791;"the music and visual style work together to create the ""Retro."
I:28;792;"future"" appeal of Fritz Lang and H. g. Wells."
I:28;793;"Ray Charle's ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" is the perfect exclamation point at the end of a long sentence."
I:28;794;Anyone familiar with Japanese art will know this theme.
I:28;795;the innocence of Tima and Kenichi add a new element to this familiar story.
I:28;796;The addition of Tezuka's optimism is something special, and rarely seen in Japanese animation.
I:28;797;This is the tale of a leader who desires to be God and create a perfect human to rule the world with him.
I:28;798;What makes a perfect human?This is Carrie meets Genesis 11 done anime style.
I:28;799;the animation is wonderful, and has cgi put in.
I:28;800;There is something that will interest most people.
I:28;801;It sends a message about family, prejudice, corruption, and tampering with human beings.
I:28;802;This film has many layers, and I'm sure most people will enjoy it.
I:28;803;At first I thought it might be the silent film, but I was hit by color!
I:28;804;This is an excellent version of that movie done in Japanese Anime.
