1;Don't get me wrong, they're great actors.
2;And if you want a great commentary.
3;all smart Alec kid that was his prerogative.
4;Instead he stood on a bridge in France with Capt. John Miller telling him, James, earn this.
5;Be worthy of my death and the deaths of my men to save your life
6;We had to ride all the way into beach with Miller and his men.
7;spielberg uses his effective form of putting ordinary men into extra.
8;for me, this it the best war movie since Lewis Milestone's All Quiet On the Western Front.
9;Best motion picture ever made.
10;It's loosly based on historical events, but each of the characters are so distincly written.
11;This is a wonderful movie!!
12;The actors are perfect for their roles!!
13;Saving Private Ryan is a very well made movie, but is somewhat 'hollywoodized'.
14;Spielburg is not one to make beauiful movies, but he puts quite a bit of depth into Saving Private Ryan.
15;I would not call it the best war movie of all time, if you think it is please see The Thin Red Line, but it is definatly one of the the best.
16;Is this the best WWII movie ever made?
17;The best movie of the year!
18;Very heart warming in it's own right.
19;Great Action and a great follow up story too.
20;This is film I enjoy watching over and over again.
21;Another perfect gift for my dad.
22;The portrayal of the characters in the squad are complex and diverse.
23;I have always been eager to talk to surviving WWII vets but now I make it a special task to shake their hand and tell them 'thank you' for the job done so selflessly by so many.
24;third it is an important work because it highlights only one of the many, many stories of a handful of average guys thrown together doing the impossible on D. day and the weeks afterwards.
25;By itself, examining it as a whole, it is a character study and human conflict all rolled into one and portrayed in vivid, engrossing detail.
26;All this brings about excellent performances from the actors who's names are both large and small.
27;First, let me say that Spielberg did an outstanding job and this is an important film with great acting.
28;limbs on a silver platter, if you will.
29;Raising food is important in war or peace.
30;and both sides hold their fire, until some Rangers act.
31;A happy ending means commercial success.
32;But this movie is exceptionally complex, you bond with the men of the squad, and although a bit more development would have been nice, its still a compelling movie.
33;This is a great movie, but the others were superior in their own ways.
34;Dozen provided comic insight, Midnight is my favorite WWII film and shows the evolution of boys to men, it is a touching coming of age story.
35;Das Boot is a submarine story told from the side of the Germans, they are developed as real, substantial young men who just wanted honor and glory, and you end up hoping they accomplish their mission even knowing it could be your relatives on those boats.
36;Kwai is the Pacific Theater, but it is so good and holds up so well, I just had to include it.
37;now I see what my grandfather and his peers experienced, and I have so much more respect for any veteran of any war.
38;Saving Private Ryan begins with a true to life portrayal of D. day and follows the touching story of a captain's mission to rescue the last living member of four brothers.
39;shocking and graphic, yet intellegent and thoughtful, this movie has given me the thought to enter the military and uphold what these men fought for, and that is what I am going upon my high.
40;incredible war drama won five academy awards,but somehow did not win best picture.
41;great acting from an emsemble and marvelous direction.
42;the D. dAY invasion is brilliantly filmed but its VIOLENT to say the least.
43;Spielberg hasn't been the great director he was in his youth for quite some time (not to say that he doesn't rake in tons of cash), but Saving Private Ryan is a throwback to his great filmmaking days.
44;He does such a good job here.
45;He gives us a good show.
46;Tom Hanks gives a spectacular performance.
47;There are also great performances by Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Ted Danson, Giovanni Ribisi, Joerg Stadler, and especially Adam Goldberg.
48;Good thing it is such a good film.
49;good shape, just as described.
50;and quick!My son will cherish it, it was his favorita movie and you made his in home date night great!
51;Acting was excellent, and the story was well thought out if perhaps a little too realistic.
52;I think they did a great job
53;oh it is the best war movie ever!
54;That glare is a deliberate special effect by Spielberg to make the picture look as if it is being seen by a soldier with tears in his eyes.
55;It is also on the VHS version and I saw it on the big screen itself.
56;i know I should talk about my opinion on the film, and I will in another review, but I thought it was important to mention this.
57;This is very accurate the way it is depicted, and the fighting is very realistic and there is no way of determining who will survive or die in the movie, just like a real war.
58;It displays the graphic and hard nature of warfare and really depicts WW2 very well.
59;I strongly recommend DTS to anyone who is on the edge of setting up a home cinema system.
60;It makes you feel like your right there with the soldiers who gave their lives for our country.
61;Spielbergs greatest acheivment so far, he is a truly talented man with limitless ideas and vision.
62;This is truely a powerful film that you will never forget.
63;The other reason is that Cornelius Ryan's epic novel on D. day, 'The Longest Day' was the first artifact of war I had to contend with when I was in school.
64;The interesting thing about Saving Private Ryan.
65;So why all the jazz about the mission, the man, and the movie?The answer comes during a poignant scene when Captain John H Miller (Tom Hanks) explains it all.
66;In my opinion, it's much more than merely following orders.
67;For me, the movie is most interesting because it brings up the eternal conundrum of war (and peace): how does one man's life compare with the 'greater good' of society?
68;That the secondary school grammar teacher from rural Pennsylvania, wrenched from his simple life and thrown into the enforced throes of war, comes to terms with this conundrum, is as sobering and inspiring as anything can be.
69;Ryan recalls a boisterous and hilarious situation with his brothers.
70;My favorite army movie of all time.
71;It's even better than full metal jacket.
72;Second favorite Tom Hanks movie behind Forest Gump.
73;I have much interest in WWII.
74;The effects are stunning, and this movie will certainly move anyone who watches it.
75;Plus, Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore do an excellent job portraying their characters.
76;I believe this is my most favorite movie out of anything, and it certainly earns the title.
77;It will live in our memories forever.
78;Bits and pieces are true.
79;This is a great movie that everybody needs to see.
80;This movie is unquestionably timeless.
81;Tom Hanks Steven Steilberg together again do a realistic job of potraying WWII.
82;The story line is great.
83;But he has made two movies that would both probably make my top five list: Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.
84;This detracts from the power they are able to convey.
85;flawless realism of the battle sequences is not for gross.
86;but what makes Saving Private Ryan a cut above all the other war movies is its story.
87;This makes it all the more powerful.
88;combine all this with superb acting all around and a stirring yet unobtrusive score from the undisputed master John Williams, and you have a movie worth owning.
89;This is the best war movie ever, this is what Spielberg can do, don't settle with Jurassic Park or E. t, this is Spielberg at his best, this movie and Schindler's List are his best movies, probably the only ones I count, both show all his sides, his smartness, his sense of humour, and his point of view about the awful but strangely appealing theme about war and the holocaust.
90;But let's cut to the chase, firstly, Tom Hanks as usual is great, the rest of the cast, probably the best movie for everyone, the are all well known but in other movies their acting abilities are either not shown or are not able to be shown, but in this movie all proof to be great, smart, serious actors, the all make you fell like you are there fighting and finding Private James Ryan.
91;The story is pretty good, plus, the movie is pretty moving.
92;You will not be disappointed, this movie deserves more stars and more Oscars, it should have got Best Movie, what was the Academy thinking, oh well if they loved Titanic so much, it is perfectly understandable that they prefer silly and romantic films like Shakespeare in Love, which was not that good.
93;Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's acclaimed 1998 film about small.
94;unit action during the early days of the Normandy battle, is perhaps one of Hollywood's best attempts to depict the horror and yet.
95;It reawakened an interest in World War II and spurred directors to make their war movies more graphically realistic.
96;the men and women Tom Brokaw rightly calls the greatest generation.
97;man squad of U. s. Army Rangers detailed to find Private James Ryan, a paratrooper whose three brothers .
98;The officer assigned to lead this almost impossible task is Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), who on D. day saw action on Omaha Beach.
99;while far from perfect, Saving Private Ryan was a daring gamble on Spielberg's part.
100;winning Schindler's List, but he had never devoted an entire film to combat before.
101;In Saving Private Ryan he carries audiences into the middle of battle, never flinching or looking away from the worst spectacles of war.
102;It is a look at the bond between soldiers in a small unit, and it shows the camaraderie and genuine affection soldiers feel for one another.
103;Furthermore, Steven Spielberg is an American director, so it is natural that he would tell his D. day story from an American point of view.
104;This will be true of all the warring countries.
105;crew list, and a special message from the director.
106;This movie won so many awards for a reason, it's one of these best movies of all time and possible the best war movie.
107;Wahay, what a great film.
108;True to life, no political bias and a generaly well rounded view of WW2.
109;Unfortunatley I grew up in England and my history lessons brainwashed us into believing that the English were involved and the Americans joined as an after thought.
110;This film has put me straight, thank you Mr Speilberg, you are a true prophet of your age
111;This movie was wonderful and insightful because it gave a valid view of war.
112;It was real and thrilling.
113;Acting was supurb and the story itself was beautiful.
114;my wife and i have always enjoyed this movie ,very well made.
115;This is a story of a team of men sent to find the last remaining male member of a family.
116;I watched it years ago and cried many times during the movie.
117;The beginning, and end sequences will amaze you with the sound coming at you from all sides.
118;With fine performances by Hanks and Sizemore, in particular.
119;one of the best War films made!
120;well amazing, but the disk is scratched up, and I have to fast forward past parts of the movie.
121;Beautifully shot, especially the opening sequence on D. day, but ultimately, there's one glaring flaw in this movie.
122;The story line was great and the acting was first rate.
123;The scenery was historically accurate and was an overall great movie.
124;This film in my opinion, must be considered one of the great films about WW11.
125;Along with the Band of Brothers film, and the Pacific film.
126;But in my view the true heart of this film is its attention to the human factor in war.
127;I highly recommend this film to WW11 fans, it is well worth adding to one's WW11 collection.
128;It can be difficult to watch at times but just like a strong spicy but tasty dish, it draws the viewer in to see it to the end.
129;i would tell anyone that has seen it ,to see it again in blu.
130;it is so much better.
131;a wonderful addition to your collection.
132;Best tom hanks movie of all.
133;I love this era in history.
134;But I love this movie it's basic on a true story and I like Tom Hunk
135;This is an awesome movie, and its my sons favorite.
136;It's a harrowing portrayal of heroism and sacrifice, and war has never looked more hellish.
137;Incredible performances from the whole cast, particularly Tom Hanks and Barry Pepper, and an evocative score from John Williams.
138;Far more than that, though, is the stunning emotional impact this film has on those who really understand what the story is all about.
139;For my money, this is the best movie to come around in the past decade period!
140;This movie has all the elements to be one of the greats!
141;What I will tell you is that you will walk away from this movie a changed person.
142;That's the sign of a special movie, not just entertaining but touches you on a spiritual level.
143;I know that sounds off the wall for a war flick but it will open your eyes to the cruelty of man!
144;This picture let's you be part of such a realistic experience, you start to suite up, grab your ammo and wait in a foxhole until the enemy rolls forward.
145;There is nothing more I can say about the movie
146;For you home theater buffs, the picture is superb and the sound track will perform an audio assault on your system.
147;The picture has an Army Green look to it, and there are some beautiful landscapes to look at in between all the carnage.
148;This is an outstanding movie that this generation/Hollywood can't grasp.
149;It has honor, integrity, courage, self sacrifice.
150;Very well done war movie, with a powerful message about making one's life count for something.
151;The script, the acting and the cinematography are all extremely good and make for a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.
152;It also is a good thinking movie with lots of situations that can be catalysts for discussion and reflection.
153;Are there gray areas?Do men fight in war for a cause, a country or simply for their compatriot?This movie is a great action flick and so much more.
154;highly recommended and worth watching over.
155;sensical films about some of the most interesting subjects then join the other cows in the field.
156;Forget the Oscars, this was the best film of 1998, and maybe several other years as well.
157;Steven Spielberg earned the Best Director Oscar for this film, and rightfully so
158;The production is incredible down to the smallest details.
159;this is a powerful, highly emotionally.
160;What Spielberg has accomplished is to make a film that is at once a memorial to those who fought and died to preserve freedom and a strong anti.
161;I was reminded over and over again of the saying that heroes are simply ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances.
162;this is, quite simply, a masterpiece of film making.
163;disc Special Edition)Great War story turned cinema depiction.
164;A welcomed addition to my History films.
165;I also recommend: Schedulers' List and Enemy at the Gate.
166;What a great tribute to the Greatest Generation.
167;The young men (boys) that stormed the beaches of Normandy, in 1944, were committed to freedom, and willing to make a difference.
168;My father was a part of this Great Crusade.
169;He was involved in intelligence and communications.
170;i have been so proud of the part that my father played.
171;Small as it may have been, it was the small contributions, made by 100's of thousands of dedicated men and women, that made the difference.
172;I really loved the action.
173;I have to say that my heart races everytime I watch the first part of the movie, and that tears fill my eyes at the end.
174;My favorite line, Ryan, . . . earn this!
175;This is something that needs to be told to our young people today.
176;The big benefit of what this movie gave to me is that it got me to think about the sacrifice, courage, pain, loss,that american men and women in uniform stepped up to keep this world free in its darkest hour.
177;ray is great
178;Most of it is barely noticeable unless you really look for it
179;there is a plentiful amount of extras, taking up a second disc in this set.
180;The battles are long, bloody, and intense.
181;In every scene, there's immaculate detail that showcases war (and the battle of Omaha beach specifically) in the most realistic light possible.
182;It's close to three hours long, but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences.
183;A combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers, and it has to be seen to be experienced.
184;the story for this is fine and dandy, and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey.
185;It's also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war, the human spirit, and philosophy.
186;otherwise, the film is exceptionally strong.
187;jerky cameramanship, I do love the photography throughout
188;shots, they are all full of detail.
189;Acting is really good
190;Writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments.
191;Production value is very strong, with highly.
192;realistic sets, props, costumes, locations, vehicles, weapons, and everything.
193;sentimental at times, but good in other parts.
194;This movie is THE best.
195;This movie is great, even if you aren't particularly into war, Spielberg captures the emotions and true hardship of war in a proffesional manner.
196;The film starts in a veterans cemetery during the present times (that is, around the time it was filmed), and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released, and for obvious biological reasons, many WW2 veterans started dying.
197;This undoubtedly happened quite a lot in World War II (and in many wars, I suppose), yet few films show such things.
198;For this honesty, I praise the movie.
199;Spielberg has been workng up to this movie for his whole life.
200;It is without a doubt one of his finest and certainly stands amoung the top war films of all time.
201;This film is a poem to the World War II veterans, and in that respect, it has a humming patriotism that recalls the films made during the war.
202;clearly the most noticeable aspect of SPR is its stunning, breathtaking brutality.
203;The Omaha beach scene and the climatic final battle are both suckerpunches of directing and cinematography, a visceral perescope view of the true violence of war.
204;This film is important and it is above all, excellently made.
205;standout performances by Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper and Tom Seizmore add great flavor to the story, along with a strong Hanks, Burns, and Damon.
206;I've watched it millions of times and I still keep watching it.
207;It is a war masterpiece and it was the top.
208;the movie begins with World War II's historic D. day invasion.
209;And then shows that eight men must recruit Private James Ryan from the battlefield.
210;the movie is very intense as you watch the brutal realities of war and the eight men who all search for hope and grows with honor and courage.
211;This is a great movie but I would not let kids under 17 watch this movie.
212;Saving Private Ryan is a tremendous film.
213;I forces the viewer to see World War II as it truely was.
214;The battle sequences is the film are amazing
215;The begining D. day sequence was directed and filmed to perfection by Spielberg.
216;The story of Private Ryan was done just as well as the battle sequences in the film, questioning what the value of human life is.
217;Private Ryan really makes you see how terrible war, as it is a well constructed anti.
218;Hanks, Sizemore, Burns, and the rest of the cast give great performances.
219;Private Ryan should have won the Oscar for best picture.
220;This film is a must see for people of any age.
221;They deserve our respect and our thanks.
222;I have seen this movie and I really liked it.
223;If you like action and war movies , you will like it.
224;Steven Speilberg did an outstanding job with this movie.
225;Not only is it realistic but it is pretty darn accurate.
226;It not only shows what the soldiers go through but their family and loved ones too.
227;He created some of the best battle seens I have ever seen.
228;He gets shot in the head.
229;The longer you watch the movie the more drawn in you become.
230;My favorite part is the Final Battle when Tom Hanks and company make a last stand.
231;Could it be he is just a good natured man?
232;In all I think this is the best World War 2 movie of all time.
233;Kudos to Mr. Spielberg for his exellent movie Saving Private Ryan.
234;we like the movie, recommended the movies to our friendswe watch the movie more then once alreadywe like the movie
235;My husband recibed this movie for christmas, the service was so quick, and the movie is in perfect condition, I feel very happy because the movie was a great price and the service was excelent.
236;This movie managed to totaly turn my emotions inside out.
237;This movie is as close as you get to the truth.
238;One if the Great War films ever made
239;Set during the Invasion of Normandy, Saving Private Ryan is a memorable movie from start to finish.
240;It is one of the most graphic and realistic portrayals of WWII (and war in general) in cinema.
241;It deserves every accolade it has received.
242;It is extremely gripping from beginning to end.
243;5/5 A great movie, a must see.
244;It is a good WWII film.
245;An excellent begining to the film with scenes depecting Omaha Beach and the tragic lose of life by the American troops for France (the ungrateful bastards).
246;A good story of honor and commitment by WWII soldiers and the irony of war and the value of life.
247;Good acting and excellent combat scenes.
248;Like everyone else who saw the film I was very impressed with the first 20 or so minute's of 'Saving Private Ryan', apart from the silly opening with the old guy in the cemetery.
249;Bullets and shrapnel have never flown so realistically on a screen.
250;Bodies have never been pulverised and destroyed so convincingly in any other film, about any other war, as far as I can remember.
251;There are very few heroes in war and this is reflected well in the 20 min Omaha beach section of the movie.
252;The banter is very good and entertaining as the men wander, somewhat without fear of German activity through the occupied French county side!
253;one of the first obstacles to their mission takes place in a superb set piece, in a shattered French town, where a German sniper has Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) squad pinned down.
254;He dispatches the squad's first casualty and it's handled marvelously.
255;right up until Spielberg has the US sniper shoot him through the eye piece of his Gewher 43 rifle, that is.
256;A simple shot through the head or chest would have sufficed and the squad could have moved on about their business, without the inducement of groans.
257;the final set piece of the movie, sees the newly found Private Ryan, his comrades and Hanks' squad, team up to hold a bridge against the oncoming Germans.
258;This noisy battle scene, which filmed with great skill, also exhibits some serious flaws.
259;Speilberg's skill as a director of action sequences is on fine display.
260;The acting for the most part is well done, with Hanks being surprisingly good as Captain Miller.
261;The lights are stolen by Tom Sizemore, however, who is watchable in every scene and superb as the ever faithful Sargent Horvath.
262;Saving Private Ryan is a great film but that is not why it can't be hurt by expectations.
263;It makes a beautiful flanking maneuver around any prediction or, for that matter, any description.
264;I knew the plot, the actors, most of the events and still I was not prepared for the film's effect.
265;after watching Saving Private Ryan , a friend described it as Horrific .
266;Spielberg manages to breath the same air as the men fighting in Europe.
267;Saving Private Ryan has an interesting story.
268;Four service stars hang in their mother's window and everything is ripe for a future of heroic deeds and tearful homecomings.
269;Initiated by a nostalgic general who seems to believe that saving Private Ryan is akin to saving his whole family
270;Go and see Saving Private Ryan .
271;If you held off because of the violence, see it any way.
272;movie is great and acting is unbelievable!
273;Really good movie with powerful sound effects.
274;The landing scene looks realistic with some that are gory.
275;saving Private Ryan(SPR): The opening scene is a huge American flag.
276;tTRL: This war is about property (Sean Penn)SPR: Tell me I've led a good life (an old.
277;its so nice to see other reviewers write such poetic editorials of this film, Spielberg certainly deserves the praise.
278;If you've seen 100 war films, please please see this !
279;THIS Blue Ray is beautifully done .
280;sound that is greater than you ever heard .
281;a master piece of a Blue Ray movie .
282;a master pierce that should be in anyone's library of movies
283;If you love Ryan, watch those films, then watch Ryan again.
284;If you still think it's the best, then more power to you.
285;the acting is excellent, throughout the cast.
286;The portrayal of thelanding at Normandy is a classic with no equal.
287;this movie is a grittily realistic masterpiece.
288;p j/k It's well worth the cost of the disk and though I seldomwatch a movie more than once, I found this movie enjoyable through repeatedviewings.
289;Saving Pvt. Ryan was the best picture of the year hands down.
290;Even the negative reviewers concede the Omaha Beach opening is stunning and excellent.
291;battle just as intense and vivid.
292;It was wise guys from NY, hillbillies from W. Virginia, hispanics from S. california, southerners, hobos, college men etc.
293;intensive fighting possible, and the advantage is usually always with the defenders.
294;If you think this is too far fetched, you should read Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers etc. and find out just how incredible small unit actions have been.
295;I thought they were fine.
296;I believe they wanted to honor these men and they played it straight.
297;but these are minor quibbles in a great effort.
298;Spielberg is a brilliant and clever director.
299;But I liked most of his touches and flourishes.
300;I liked the sniper seeing the other sniper shooting at him.
301;the bit of deception at the opening and closing of the film because by the time it ended I was moved by the sentiment.
302;I thought all the combat throughout had a genuine feel never depicted as accurately before.
303;His camerawork and direction was continuously inventive.
304;The courage as that mustered up and brought to bear by ordinary men.
305;And it WAS an experience (especially on the big screen) that was exceptional for eye, ear and emotions.
306;I found it a beautiful tribute to the fathers and grandfathers who did what they had to do.
307;He was the best allied commander of the war.
308;Frankly, I enjoyed this movie, if only for its special effects.
309;As well, most other scenes whether or not they include actual fighting are impressively reconstructed with extensive attention paid to detail and Spielberg and the rest of his production crew certainly deserve kudos for a job well done.
310;I am almost certain that, in the real world, rewarding an act of insubordination in such a way would have tempted the rest of the platoon to demand similar treatment.
311;And remaining behind to defend the town?
312;To say this film is just a combination of great footage is completely overlooking the greatness of this film.
313;The opening battle scene is a masterpiece of chaos.
314;The closing battle is just as moving in a clear.
315;The performances are all uniformly incredible.
316;Jeremy Davies deserves special mention for his incredible nervous breakdown scene.
317;I saw this film twice, six months a part, yet remembered every detail of that devastating scene.
318;i highly reccomend this film.
319;One of the very best, the story, sound, the actions, the video, actors etc.
320;Best adaptation of the d. day landings by far love this movie.
321;Also recommend band of brothers for the opposite view from behind enemy lines
322;Right from the start Spielberg throws the audience right into the meatgrinder to show that war is hell, but even through it all men rise up to do what is needed to survive and help their fellow soliders.
323;The cinema verite documentary style Spielberg and his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used for the entirety of the Omaha Beach landing on D. day is one of the best shot 30 minute of film ever.
324;the script is not as tight as that of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but the dialogue remains strong enough to keep me interested in the fate of the men sent of to find Private Ryan.
325;Spielberg has set the bar high when it comes to creating a film about war and people have tried to reach it, but still have to succeed.
326;It is also one of the best filmmaking Spielberg has done and one of the best film in the last 20 years.
327;The is the best war movie I have ever seen.
328;The production, cast, location ae absolutly marvelous.
329;The scenes are so naturally produced that they seem real.
330;I love this movie, and believe me you will love it too.
331;You will be able to read about the movie from other reviewers, but for the record, it was an exsquisite and moving film.
332;Needless to say, both are incredible sounding, however the DTS, I feel gives more depth to the sound environment around you.
333;The Dolby Digital version gives more of a precise, pinpoint sound in each of the speakers, however the DTS version gives more of a 360 degree feel to the sound, blending the sounds from one speaker to the other.
334;In the DTS you are able to hear more of the gun shots especially from distant shots.
335;Best example of this is comparing the portion of the movie right after the first big fight.
336;Ambiant sounds are more clear in general and enveloping in the DTS.
337;I agree with the review by Mr. Wilkins.
338;Anyone interested in this Blu.
339;They are most likely a fan of the film, and already know the plot and the actors.
340;def transfer and audio, and perhaps any added extras.
341;it's really 2 stories .
342;one fictional and one true.
343;hour or so is an authentic masterpiece of recreating the D. day invasion at Omaha beach.
344;held cameras to give you a your are one of the grunts perspective and spectacular special effects is simply amazing.
345;overall, this is a true masterpiece, because it's a movie that leaves a permanent impression on those who have the guts to watch it.
346;It should have won the Best Picture award.
347;Saving Private Ryan combines a raw and gritty cast with awesome special effects and a powerful soundtrack.
348;The result is arguably one of the best war movies ever made.
349;The film is packed with emotionally charged action and moral dilemmas that WWII soldiers were faced with.
350;Each character is very unique and interesting, and the movie does nothing to spare the audience from the harsh realities of war and combat.
351;I watched this movie in history class and loved it.
352;It is so realistic and one of the better and more accurate historical movies.
353;Great condition and arrived earlier than expected.
354;ray player + surround sound+ Saving Private Ryan = an amazing experience
355;it was a great movie
356;I have Saving Private Ryan (D. day 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)I enjoyed it much,,This Movie is The greatest WWII Movie I've ever Seen.
357;It is a good one.
358;It is so wonderful movie and I like this program service from the amazon, I can use this program very weekend.
359;Saving Private Ryan is one of the best movies ever made.
360;The casting is flawless, with the exception perhaps of Matt Dammon.
361;This was Pepper's best movie.
362;I had seen it before and it is a good movie.
363;Great gift for the men in the family.
364;This is a superb movie, one with a horrifying depiction of the terrifying action on the beaches and in the fields of Normandy during those first few fateful days in June of 1944.
365;Stephen Spielberg hooks you into the story by using a contemporary scene of the massive burial grounds where thousands of Allied casualties are buried to introduce a main character, who then remembers, in a flashback so vividly monumental in its scope that it will certainly leave you breathless and gasping for air.
366;The cinematography is exceptional, and the scenes depicting the landing on Omaha Beach on D. day are so graphic and done so masterfully that one reels in attempting to describe them.
367;They must be experienced to be fully appreciated, and then hopefully on large screen TV system with an excellent sound system.
368;the supporting cast is terrific, from Tom Sizemore to Edward burns to Jeremy Davies to Vin Diesel to Harrison Young, who plays the fifty.
369;Of course, Matt Damon turns in a wonderful performance as the young Ranger who finds himself conflicted by the set of existential circumstances him finds himself in, all of his brothers killed, and ordered to now desert is own squad under fire to save himself.
370;But excellent performances are nothing unusual for this very gifted young actor.
371;The entire cast supports the emotional telling of this tale.
372;this is the second of Spielberg's movies about World War Two, the first being Schindler's List.
373;This shows a growing sense of seriousness and a new gravity to his work, which is both popular and now more substantive.
374;Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling.
375;Steven Spielberg proves once again that he is head and shoulders above everybody else.
376;The first 20 minutes or so of the film is some of the rawest, most gripping, most brutal piece of film ever filmed.
377;The war scenes are as real as real could get.
378;You'll feel like you were right there.
379;The sound is the greatest sound I've experienced in watching a film.
380;This movie is very brilliant and highly educational.
381;It's important for everybody to see this film.
382;There are moments of this film that will haunt you for a very long time.
383;The German, with gun in hand, just looks at the American and keeps walking.
384;The cast is incredibly good.
385;Matt Damon is good, but he could've been given a better part.
386;This is a very special, important film.
387;Just watch it and have the great feeling afterwards that you've seen it.
388;Wonderful acting, detailed storyline, and breathtaking special effects.
389;Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore put in their usual top level performance and the remainder of the cast is rock solid as well.
390;The true gem of this movie
391;The opening sequence on Omaha Beach sets the pace.
392;This level of realism continues throughout the movie culminating with a close combat battle between GI's and authentic German Armor.
393;This is that rare movie that lives up to its reputation!
394;One of the best war movies ever made.
395;One of Tom Hanks best roles, showing great range as an actor.
396;Saving Private Ryan has a realistic story due to the fact that it was based on real life incidents.
397;The sound and the visual effects are extremely impressive and at times I felt like I was in the middle of it all.
398;The acting was not academy award winning performance but it was convincing enough.
399;This movie was cheated out of the best picture of the year award, needless to say I feel that it was one of the best pictures of all time, and should become a classic.
400;If my son loves it I love it.
401;Another towering achievement for Steven Spielberg, this is a must.
402;regardless, the action on the beach before the German defenses were overrun was intense and thrilling.
403;The film consisted of the riveting opening, the absolutely thrilling conclusion, with a lull in the middle.
404;As this films shows, it came at a catastrophic price for all those involved.
405;Hank's Captain Miller in particular is a very well rounded character who must not only face adversity from the enemy but also from his own men who constantly label the mission as FUBAR (****** up beyond all recognition).
406;steven Spielberg's direction is nearly flawless.
407;The soldiers hope everything will be better and they can get back to their lives at home.
408;So naturally this film is not beautiful in the sense that there are colorful flowers and blue skies everywhere.
409;I am going to be wholly honest in my review.
410;what the film does with extraodinary precision and accuracy, is re.
411;The effective use of hand.
412;The final sequences are as exciting, yet frightening as anything you'll ever see.
413;The violence is excessive and at times hard to stomach, but the honesty and realness of the war scenes greatly enhance the impact of the film.
414;rounded, with Tom Hanks giving a highly.
415;effective performance as a Captain who is tired of wathcing the kids he's trained die in front of him.
416;Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribesi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies round out a diverse and talented cast.
417;even if parts of the film bore you, Saving Private Ryan is a film that everyone should see, all the time telling themselves that young men actually lived this.
418;finally, people can use this film to appreciate the tremendous sacrifice that those before us made.
419;My grandfather landed at Normandy and stormed the beach.
420;He survived that day, and the entire war.
421;I will never get to meet my grandfather, but will always know that he was a brave man.
422;This is a well put together film.
423;all the plot is pretty simple and some liberties have been taken with history (as with virtually all movies based on. )
424;but this film makes you appreciate what it must have felt like to be involved in the Normandy invasion.
425;The graphics were wonderful with no aliasing artifacts and the colors authentic.
426;done, further enhancing the realism.
427;spielberg won accolades for filtering scenes to give a documentary look.
428;If you look for it you will see what I mean .
429;if you are a war movie buff it is a modern slice of a WWII experience.
430;but the movie as a portrayal of the type of combat seen in western Europe is a good one .
431;to fully understand the importance of World War II, and specifically, what the soldiers had to go through.
432;It really touched me on a personal level that I've never felt in a war movie before.
433;the movie begins on a really intense level, and continues for the next 30 minutes without letting up on all sorts of gun shootings, explosions, bodies falling apart and drifting away, hopeless feelings lingering in the air.
434;Saving Private Ryan will surprise and shock you on many occasions.
435;Sometimes the film seems so real it's almost like you're there with the soldiers.
436;It is an awesomely powerfull and moving film which keeps up the intensity for the whole 3 hours.
437;Tom Hanks, as usual was supurb, he did a remarkable job of fitting the character of a hardened war captain.
438;the effects also were stunning.
439;thoughout the film there is good character development as the team start to bond in the face of grave danger.
440;The theme about where the captain came from is a nice touch.
441;it is an epic film which fully deserves all the oscars that it got.
442;This movie is truly fantastic and incorproates everything!!!!
443;It's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and would reccomend it to anybody!!
444;Tom Hanks does a superb job as does everybody else in the film.
445;It should have won Best Picture!!!!
446;This is an excellent movie based on several battles and missions of WWII.
447;Yet the Director's Words are great to watch.
448;First off, I think this is a great movie.
449;Tom Hanks is awesome and so is Tom Sizemore.
450;The production shots are memorable and even, at one point, include a beach scene viewed through blood on the camera lens.
451;The first 20 minutes are absolutely hypnotizing.
452;This undoubtedly occurred but it was a very rare circumstance.
453;One of our favorite movies.
454;john Williams' music was splendid as always.
455;He makes it easier to accept the truth of war with his stirring arrangements.
456;After I got thru the first 5 min.
457;Parts of this drama filled tale are documentary like.
458;It is a tale worth telling and one worth watching but bloody scene after bloody scene have you cringing with the realism.
459;Gets to the heart of what's most important in an unforgettable way.
460;Saving Private Ryan is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and definitely the best war film I've ever seen by far.
461;It is probably my favorite movie at the moment.
462;Tom Hanks does an excellent job in this role.
463;The battle scenes are amazingly realistic, and the sound is fantastic.
464;The opening scene (D Day invasion) will give you a whole new respect for WWII veterans.
465;The effects were both sickening and wonderful.
466;i found the story heartwarming and depressing.
467;The opening sequences of this film are spectacular and alone are worth the price of admission.
468;These scenes are some of the most powerful war scenes ever filmed.
469;You may feel sure of yourself because you can always say 'This is true, I've seen it.'
470;Saving Private RyanSaving Private Ryan is an epic World War II film directed by Steven Spielberg.
471;It is truly one of the most moving and realistic modern day portrayals of World War II.
472;Even though this is a movie, it holds very true to actual events, being based on the lives of eight U. s. soldiers attempting to find Private Ryan and tell him that his continued service in the U. s. army is excused due to the fact that all three of his brothers had died in combat.
473;From this tranquil point, there is a dramatic transition into the most moving and graphic war.
474;Saving Private Ryan is best known for its enactment of one of the bloodiest war.
475;This scene is the landing of the Americans in Normandy and the invasion of France, otherwise known as D Day.
476;Even though the Americans sustained heavy causalities, they still managed to take the beach head.
477;the movie has more than one scene that is truly engraved in one's mind.
478;For instance, the part where the mother of Private Ryan is told that all three of her sons were killed is equally memorable.
479;It is truly amazing that Spielberg was able to convey his message to the audience, without actually using dialogue, which makes the movie all the more powerful.
480;It is a story of human courage and sacrifice.
481;this film truly leaves a lasting impression on viewers.
482;Nothing I have seen has come close to it.
483;One cannot help but have an enormous amount of respect for those who so bravely gave their lives in this war.
484;I watched this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it very much!
485;ray and this month I chose Saving Private Ryan as one to replace.
486;The Sound was also fantastic.
487;It has good special features as well.
488;This is a great war movie.
489;Lots of action and a delightful story line.
490;Then this movie is a great movie about how the Greatest Generation served this country.
491;This movie was so intense that a co. worker in my office nearly had shell shock after watching it on a big screen.
492;Prior to that you never really felt a movie from a pure soldiers point of view.
493;That was worth four stars.
494;i highly encourage people to watch this movie.
495;conversely, there is a modern town hall meeting where the men were moving in a combat formation and talking.
496;The best war film since the days of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg both bring their trademark goods to the table, and wow, this film just delivers.
497;This film, like Schindler's List before it, shows a realistic depiction of WW11 that leavs its mark on you even long before the closing credits have rolled down the screen to the tune of the National Anthem.
498;Speilberg does an excellent job throughout the film reminding us that the people we are watching are not just actors, for they are portraying real, nameless people.
499;Hanks, in another unforgettable performance as Platoon captain, is leading his men to the center of the war to retrieve one man, Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon.
500;I absolutely recommend watching this pic .
501;My hats off to Tom Hanks, absolutely the finest actor that has come around since the 30's to the 50's!
502;the rest of the movie has its horrors, but it's also a story of faith, redemption, sacrifice, and the American attitude toward war.
503;This is probably the most interesting thing about it.
504;No other film I have seen is this powerful and frightening.
505;Many thanks to Mr. Spielberg for giving my father and his contemporaries a reason to talk about this war.
506;since there is no way a film can honestly reflect history this is quite an accomplishment.
507;Technically, this is a very good film.
508;Everyone knows about the stunning spectacle that is the initial half an hour.
509;For this piece of action i would be tempted to award full marks.
510;There are so many worthy subjects upon which to base a film about war.
511;Maybe this is all very comforting for the American pshyce, but this very worrying and concerning for the rest of us.
512;this brings me onto my second grievance of films such as SPR.
513;I can tell what is going on without hearing the swearing and the emotional moments.
514;War is and always will be tragic and it touches everyone.
515;I don't like talking too much good stuff about people who get alot of good things in life and don't deserve it but this film is full of those people.
516;Spielberg had good pace in this war film and makes you forget about the numbness in you .
517;It's a good view, with a little bit of gore but overall an outstanding effort.
518;pretty intense at times too!
519;The movie Saving Private Ryan was on of the best war movies that I have ever seen.
520;This movie takes you to the heart of the moment where soilders came face.
521;The actors in this movie did a wonderful job making it as realistic as possible.
522;I say the movie Saving Private Ryan is the best and anyone who disagrees please don't try and ruin it for the rest of us.
523;The opening D. day landing sequence was absolutely amazing.
524;Speilberg really takes the kid gloves off and with a frightening realistic look at the Omaha beach landing.
525;This movie gives some good insight into the ordinary soldier and what they faced.
526;I'm not a real Hanks fan, but he was excellent in this movie.
527;The casting was great and believable.
528;One thing I did appreciate about this movie is that it kept in line with history.
529;it calls us to ask of ourselves the same question .
530;are/have our lives been worthy of the sacrifice made on our behalf .
531;all in all a good movie .
532;The beginning and ending are fabulously realistic.
533;Roars of laughter from the 10 year olds.
534;Best movie ever it has really good graphics the actor's are amazing and its really accurate about the war ya
535;The definitive movie on WWII.
536;I watch it every D. day with my sons.
537;If you like this, you should also watch Band of Brothers.
538;Still the best Hollywood film on WW2, with a stellar cast, vivid visuals, and directed by the gifted Steven Spielberg.
539;There's no doubt in my mind, that anyone who has seen such films as The Dirty Dozen , Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes , have been lead to think, that World War II was an exciting and funny adventure.
540;But is war really just a lot of fun and excitement?
541;held cameraes, which gives everything a documentary look, or the close.
542;ups of kaptajn John Miller, played by Tom Hanks.
543;And how COULD it be funny?
544;This one shows us the horror of war and bloodshed, and does it without any raised fingers.
545;Yes, it is, if your name is Steven Spielberg.
546;It took several viewings for me to realize what a great movie (and story) this is.
547;Now it's one of my favorites.
548;p. s. if you like this movie be sure to watch HBO's Band of Brothers, also a Tom Hanks project with Steven Spielberg.
549;In my opinion, one of the best things HBO has ever done!
550;This movie, Saving Private Ryan arrived on time in good condition.
551;This film has one of the best soundtracks using DTS and will push your system to the limits of home cinema.
552;The film is very real and effective even though its 2 hours 49 mins.
553;You will need a strong stomach at the start though.
554;The plot, however unrealistic it may be, suits the 8 characters well.
555;Saving Private Ryan, in short, is the most realistic war film ever made.
556;war film with poetic overtones.
557;THere are a few unrealistic or wooden points in this movie, but besides those few parts, it is a perfect, well.
558;the evolution and decision making skills of Captain Miller is outstanding!
559;This is a very solid movie which deserves to be called classic.
560;First 20 minutes makes this one of the top 100 films ever made .
561;The opening battle sequence has been acclaimed as one of the most realistic ever filmed,and I believe it.
562;the rest of the story is of course equally important,as all of the stories that WW2 brought to light and inspired.
563;a terrible war fought by extremely brave men to reclasim liberty to so many.
564;To the best of my knowledge, they didn't use Marder SPG's either.
565;This is my absolute favorite movie of all time this movie combines a thrilling soundtrack, some amazing action scenes, a look into the nature of man and war and, most importantly a stunning tribute to the great men and women ready and willing to give there lifes for there country on those shores so far away from home.
566;although it is a rather vivid movie, it is good for all ages who are interested in learning about our great nation's heretige.
567;First of all I would like to thank to the whole stars who took skillful role in this attractive film.
568;i felt myself just inside it as I was watching it in the theatre.
569;in my opinion Steven SPIELBERG who is called as the pioneer of cinema created a marvellous work by paying attention to the all details.
570;the relations,feelings,were very dramatic,and attractive beyond its war side.
571;There has been countless movies made about WW2, each with there pros and cons.
572;steven Speilberg has created probably the most realistic war movie to date, however gritty, however horrifying it may be it is for a purpose.
573;He told the story the way it deserved to be told.
574;I know my fair share about the Normandy invasions and I can honestly say this is EXTREMELY accurate.
575;The cast does an excellent job of portraying there characters.
576;Especially Tom Hanks and Sizemore, perfect for this movie.
577;This movie is very awsome it has a cool story line and is completely historicaly accurate.
578;It gets right to the point from the time the flag is fluttering in the breeze right up to the ending salute by the older Ryan.
579;I, of course, like so many others got teary.
580;I am glad that Spielberg made this picture.
581;It is high time a filmmaker brought the horrors of World War II to the modern cinema so the young can get somewhat on an idea of the sacrifice the men and women of that generation made so that this generation could enjoy their basic freedoms.
582;The combat footage in this movie is what truly makes it stand out.
583;Hanks has a knack for playing everyman, and does so once again here with terrific skill.
584;while the plot wasn't the greatest and the characters are not really too deep (Uppum, along with Hanks's and Giovanni Ribisi's characters excepted), the combat footage in this movie is without peer, and that reason alone makes it one of the great war movies ever made.
585;i consider this movie to be one of the all time greatest movies made.
586;It shows the realities of this horrifying war and the spirit amongst the soldiers who fought for our freedom.
587;It's a strange feeling but one that definately bought a tear to my eye.
588;this film is a fantastic tribute to all those who fought in the war and is a movie that will definately not be forgotten by those who see it.
589;This is the best war movie ever!
590;The first half hour or so when Tom Hanks and crew land on the beaches of Normandy is the most realistic war secene ever!
591;This is an Absloutly must see!
592;Spielberg did a fantastic job of portraying WWII.
593;He and his team did an outstanding job of getting the feel with out actually being there.
594;Despite little inaccuracies, such a the characters talking while moving through enemy territory, which were purposely put in for character developement, I fould the film gripping.
595;The other actors were great as well.
596;When I first saw this film there was not a dry eye in the theater, especially the veterans were moved to tears.
597;I give great adoration to Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks team for making such a wonderful film.
598;Also, I enjoyed this movie much more than the Thin Red Line, which felt like a Vietnam movie set in the WW2 era.
599;I see Vietnam and Korea as stupid, bloody wastes of American lives, and the moral issues of the Gulf war trouble me, but I am proud of what our nation did in World War II and proud of the verterans who fought in it and gave their lives for a better (though still imperfect) world.
600;Now after finally relenting and giving this WWII war film a viewing all I can say is it's fantastic!
601;It succeeds on every level, unique and well conceived storyline, sharp, insightful dialogue, impressive production values, outstanding ensemble cast and of course a magnificent soundtrack by the legendary John Williams.
602;there's definitely an unending string of accolades you could bestow upon this film and all would be undeniably deserved, this is most certainly one of the great war films of all.
603;Watching these American soldiers deal with the crisis and chaos that is part and parcel of everyday life on the front.
604;lines is both exhilarating and heart wrenching as the audience slowly comes to realize that acts of bravery and heroism are nothing more than the innate desire of mans will to survive made manifest.
605;Spielberg goes one step further in his analysis of the human condition as he posits the ultimate question to those who where blessed with the gift of life
606;The answer
607;There are few stories and better yet films that better capture the horrors of war like this.
608;The authenticity and honesty captured here underlines the unbelievable sacrifice our nation and specifically the soldiers endured in the darkest hours of WW II.
609;the acting is impeccable, the cinematography stunning and shocking, and the story is gut wrenching.
610;this is arguably one of the greatest films of all time.
611;I highly recommend it although it will be quite graphic and disturbing.
612;Saving Private Ryan is an instant classic.
613;a wonderfully told story filled with action, heroism, sacrifice and honor set during WWII.
614;The end of the movie brought a tear to my eye.
615;Being my favorite movie, I decided to read what others thought of this film.
616;In the movie's shortened sequence the confusion, panic, courage, and pain shined through in breif, but, meaningful segments.
617;Tragic and surprising things happened.
618;Capt. Miller is clearly shaken by his experiences in the war and, as detailed in his monologue following the storming of the machine gun.
619;It is a profound respect for men who made decisions and faced situations that I hope to never see in my lifetime.
620;For that I honor this film.
621;ray and the movie was well staged to reflect actual war movie.
622;Without any dialogue that visual scene is absolutely heart wrenching.
623;People wept in the theaters when I saw it (twice) and it still brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it again.
624;For me, it was the range of emotions from horror to heartfelt to incredible valor that made this Spielberg film such a classic.
625;For a purely memorable movie.
626;watching experience, Saving Private Ryan scores a definitive 5.
627;great ensemble cast of Tom Hanks, Ed Burns, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel.
628;It is probably the best period piece on World War two I have ever seen.
629;I tend to be skeptical when it comes to war movies historical drama ETC. but this movie is exceptional.
630;I can only say that I wish I had seen this one in the theatres A+ Material Tom Hanks is amazing and the rest of the cast provide a believable as well as outstanding performance.
631;This film is a magnificent testement to the sacrifices all our figthing men in WWII made in order to ensure the freedom we have taken for granted today.
632;Underneath all those shrapnel explosions, Spielberg and Hanks compose real human beings under extroadinary challenges.
633;The tension stays reliably intense as our small group of troubled soldiers embark hesitantly towards their possible destinies.
634;They are symbolic of the film's purpose, and are not meant to be artistic re.
635;In Saving Private Ryan we see plenty fanatastic characterizations from every in ths cast.
636;The film like many other Spielberg movies captures many aspects of old films in the same genre.
637;Unlike most flmmakers, it is the ciematic storytelling of Spielberg that makes all the differece.
638;One look at the unbelievable dramaitic impact of the film's opening Omaha Beach sequence just goes to show that when it comes to WWII material movies Spielberg still has it.
639;This movie is really shows the bondage between soldiers and the story is really good.
640;I really enjoyed watching the film.
641;This is by far the best war movie I have ever seen.
642;I have owned this movie since it came out and I still watch it all the time.
643;The success of the amphibious landing depens on the air support as well.
644;At this very moment it'S understood that Private Ryan is the last son of a family whose three sons have been killed in other fronts.
645;Captain John Miller must take his men behind the enemy lines to find Private Ryan.
646;Here at this point we understand the importance of the continuation of a family for the American society.
647;This is a very good example of mutual respect between the country and citizen.
648;This is one of the very important reasons which makes the United States so powerful.
649;The feelings of loyalty and responsibility are the most important factors in a country's progress.
650;Spielberg and his crew have given a very important message to people by making this movie.
651;Still and awesome movie and was even better in blu.
652;Great examples of leadership and ethics in action.
653;Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle.
654;During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20.
655;Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc.
656;Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.
657;Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others.
658;if you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.
659;This film is one of the top films ever made.
660;This film is definitly worth purchasing.
661;first 20 minutes depict the invasion of Normandy a bit gruesome but so accurate!
662;Love the message of the movie.
663;Historically, Omaha Beach had the highest casualty rate of the entire Normandy invasion.
664;A tribute to those (Axis and Allied) who died on the field of battle in the Second World War, Saving Private Ryan is a movie that should be recognized as one of the greatest, most compelling films of our time.
665;Spielberg jampacked this movie with so much patriotism it makes you want to puke.
666;The movie is filled to the brim with so much Hallmark Hall of Fame.
667;Spielberg's new style is a bunch of cut and paste work.
668;That's about all there is that's good about this movie.
669;and yes the movie is not perfect, especially since it had to live up to the opening scene, but overall it was still very good with more scenes that worked than didn't.
670;the cast did an outstanding job and Tom Hanks turned in a wonderful, low key performance.
671;A great amount of work was done in researching the details so that you feel like you are there.
672;landing scene, but I was riveted for the rest of the night and the next morning.
673;But I understand that this is, after all, a movie and Spielberg could only take realism so far.
674;There are really two themes to this film.
675;Second, the real theme of this film is the depiction of WWII type combat action.
676;Both themes run together quite well and what we end up with is the best war movie ever made.
677;They are depicted as die hards so that Spielberg can set up his own storyline, which he pulls off very well.
678;this film also broke new ground in the depiction of combat and there are so many films that have copied it since that it is clear that Saving Private Ryan set a special effects standard for Hollywood on a level that Star Wars did back in the 70s and early 80s.
679;even if you hate war films I recommend that you watch this movie at least once.
680;It is a kind of a historical document and it will allow you to better appreciate the burden of the WWII soldier who gave so much to win freedom for the world in a time of dark tyranny.
681;in my opinion, this movie is easily one of the top ten to fifteen movies ever made.
682;This film brings the war to the screen through the eyes of a handful of soldiers picked to carry out a most unique mission: Bring back the lone remaining member of the Ryan family.
683;The often told story of the four brothers drafted at sent off to war is widely known, but this is a very touching and artful depiction of the men who reluctantly set off to recover Private Ryan and return him to his grieving mother.
684;Hanks will never be able to play a character the lager than life, macho way that John Wayne did, but he brings a certain every.
685;The militray type preparation that all of the actors went through to make this film really pays off because as you're watching you believe that these men are actual soldiers fighting for survival.
686;The much publicized, and often talked about opening scene depicting the storming of the beach is intense and sometimes difficult to watch.
687;The violence and blood are plentiful, but it is essential to the telling of the story and setting the tone for the film.
688;If you have not seen this film it is definitely worth the time to sit down and watch.
689;Saving Private Ryan is probably the best World War 2 movie ever made.
690;The cast is excellent, and the cinematography unparalleled.
691;It is full of brilliant cinematic moments, such as the segueway after the horrific opening D. day sequence: The screen goes blank for a second, and we hear the layered sounds of typewriters clicking like machine guns as Army typists write next of kin letters.
692;the most realistic and moving depiction of death in cinema, to me.)
693;The music is great, the characters vividly drawn, the historical details perfect.
694;steven Spielberg made this film as a tribute to his father, who served as a radio operator in the Pacific theater.
695;He'd been thinking of making a big film like this for a long time, and it is rewarding to watch.
696;This is an excellent story and movie.
697;This epic story contains the ingredients of true valor integrity courage, and the perils and rigors of WWII for the freedom of French and Jewish people.
698;Reviews for this movie are pretty much ineffectual.
699;The hype for this movie is right on.
700;It has The best opening scene in any movie.
701;after this movie, Steve Spielberg decided to do the Band of Brothers which is also very good.
702;if you like War Movies and you haven't seen this, you must see it.
703;It tells you what it was really like on the beach.
704;If you are a big war movie fan or Steven spielberg fan than this is the film I recomend you to check out!
705;Great movie, great story, and a film to go into history as a milemarker for the 90's
706;Awesome movie, even better with this edition.
707;If you don't have a copy of this film, definitely get it.
708;Just another one of the hard knocks of life, let's deal with it, beat those sons of b*tches, and get back home.
709;This film captures the gritty, grim resignation, yet the hope for the future that a boomer (or younger) can only imagine.
710;Spielberg is a very good storyteller, and this film is one of his best.
711;If Hanks hadn't won too many Oscars already, he should have won for this one.
712;He captures the essence of what an American citizen/soldier/patriot was then, and still is today.
713;Even though of the gore and the intense deaths and violence, this video seems great and it tells the truth.
714;Few films have moved me the way this film has.
715;The scene on the Normandy beach is one of the most gripping and realistic war scenes ever filmed.
716;Saving Private Ryan embodies the esssence of patriotism.
717;while the film is a sweeping historical (patriotic) epic, it includes many subplots dealing with the meaning of war, sacrifice, honor, courage, fear, death, family, etc.
718;The two films compliment each other and belong in every collection of World War II movies.
719;Private RyanTo what extent can we ever really understand the contributions and sacrifices of the greatest generation?
720;People that send young people into war should see this movie just before they do it.
721;The ending of the movie is the mostfitting tribute to a veteran and to all veteransthat is possible.
722;This film, while tough to watch in parts, shows the price paid in World War II.
723;Saving Private Ryan from acclaimed director Steven Spielberg manages to portray the horror of war without ever making you want to turn the film off.
724;As your interest is almost gone it explodes in stunning style.
725;This is a great 2.
726;disc selection with the one disc that gives much insight into how the movie was made.
727;What a value this DVR is for that price!
728;This is a film that must be added to your collection.
729;Even if you don't like war, this movie is for you, it address the human spirit, and life in general.
730;It isn't pro war or anti war, it's pro life, and shows what has to be done at times to preserve life.
731;Tom Hanks will bring you to your knees, and the supporting cast is so good, you feel like you know each one of them.
732;This movie is one of the best ww2 movies ever made.
733;Great movie at an even better price.
734;It's past the time that we should be impressed simply by honest storytelling about war, but this story really gets it right.
735;This movie hits the mark.
736;See this movie and then thank a WWII vet for the contributions they made to the USA.
737;Crystal clear, sound's amazing, one of the best Blu.
738;ray movies I have ever seen.
739;anyway, great movie to add to the collection.
740;From the landing up through taking most of the beach, Spielberg does a staggering job of presenting the American end of operation Overloard.
741;The stunning authenticity of the landing degenerates into war movie cliches and Norman Rockwell.
742;We've got the offhand dismissal of the British and Commonwealth contribution, even though they did most of the bleeding in the first weeks to take the heat of the Americans.
743;diverse squad, each with his own identifiable personality trait.
744;timed appearance by the cavalry, and a heroic and prolonged death scene for our hero.
745;The first 30 minutes is in my opinion absolute cinematic genius, a staggering accomplishment.
746;As good as Saving Private Ryan is (and it's pretty good), I can only hope this paves the way for a truly great World War II movie.
747;A very moving epic about a group of American Rangers sent on a mission to rescue one man who's brothers had been killed earlier in combat.
748;This movie sets the ground for anyone interested in WW2 history and the men involved.
749;A great performance by Sizemore, Hanks and Matt Daemond, just an excellent film.
750;It's so moving and so filled with action that you find both exciting and horrifying at the same time that it's hard to describe.You come away from Saving Private Ryan speechless.
751;Grateful for a generation of men who were willing to lay down their lives to do what's right by serving their country in the war against Hitler.
752;journalist perspective for many of the combat scenes which gives the movie a sort of modern newsreel feeling.
753;Running the film in stereo gives you much the same sensations that you get out of seeing it at the movies.
754;i can't recommend this movie highly enough.
755;It's on my personal top five list of all time.
756;Great movie
757;Well i have seen many great war films in my short life, The Longest Day , A Bridge too Far , to name but a few, but this film has to top the lot.
758;in the opening Omagh beach sequence, I was shocked, and moved at the scenes shown.
759;The acting was brilliant and so to was the camera work.
760;This is a great movie.
761;A powerful masterpiece, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan deserved the Best Picture Oscar that went to Shakespeare in Love.
762;Everyone should see this film if not for its sheer power, for its message which permeates throughout the entire film effortlessly and subtly.
763;from the opening scene to the final showdown this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
764;deserved, in my humble opinion.
765;In the bonus material, there is a mention of Spielberg's desire to depict the emotions that must have been felt through the eyes of the actors, while briefly showing one look in each soldier's eyes.
766;At that moment, I thought Bingo.
767;THAT is what gives this film its staying power .
768;the mark of all good films.
769;based decision to be made on the spot certainly qualifies.
770;I realize the film couldn't be that long, but a good filmaker ought to be able to make it appear as though more time has passed.
771;Any film that can inspire that kind of interest and have this ultimate impact earns 5 stars from me.
772;It's a classic that just touches my heart and how amazing tom hanks was in this movie!
773;Amazing movie, but it did tug at my heartstrings a bit, and I mostly grimaced rather than smiled.
774;Just watch it already, it's worth the money.
775;the best viewing is at the theater.
776;unless you're so blessed with an outstanding $$home theater$$.
777;finally it has been released in this format.
778;But I kept watching it for some strange reason and months later I bought it.
779;For more then two years it ranks as my number one favorite movie.
780;After the mother finds out she realises the youngest son James is still alive.
781;In all this movie was dedicated to the veterans.
782;At Oscar night the film was awarded five Oscars including Best Director.
783;It really was the winner of Best Picture Over Shakespear In Love.
784;I've recommended it to more then 200 people and have seen it more then 500 times.
785;saving Private Ryan, see it tonight.
786;Without question the best movie of the 90s, possibly best of the 20th century.
787;On top of that the film is an all time winner of true war realizm.
788;Steven Spielberg I always find is better when he does heartwarming stores(Close Encounters, E. t) or action type stuff(Jurassic Park, Minority Report) but now and then he wants to go ultra.
789;realistic and while Schindler's List is a very nicely done film, it feels its length.
790;inspired by a true story(although modified slightly), Private James Ryan is 1 of 4 brothers who are in war.
791;Pretty simple story set against the backdrop of World War II and in particular the Invasion of Normandy.
792;speaking of which, that scene is probably one of the most realistic war scenes ever filmed.
793;Shot largely handheld the camera is always moving and zipping around and even going underwear than surfacing.
794;Everyone else is likable too, even Vin Diesel who to me has only done 2 good performances: this and Pitch Black.
795;the look of the film is interesting too cause the filmmakers color saturated the film to make it look the way it does and also cinematographer Kaminski is kinda famous for this grainy look, the film kind of looks ugly.
796;But he did win for Best Cinematography so who am I to talk?I don't find this film to be one of those re.
797;I'd seen this before but we wanted to see it again and it is a very moving picture with wonderful performances.
798;Possibly the best motion picture ever made.
799;Includes an incredibly realistic depiction of the horrific D. day beach invasion.
800;A nearly perfect production of an amazing story presented by excellent actors with superb direction.
801;The theater was packed and we had taken out seats in the middle row.
802;With popcorn and soda firmly in hand, I was set to enjoy a nice evening at the movies.
803;I hadn't been to the theater in many years and it felt good just being there with its ambiance.
804;The sheer power of the audio, combined with the stunning visual elements in the theater environment is incomparable.
805;furthermore, I look forward to the day when the film may be re.
806;released in some good, independent theater.
807;I will be one of of the first in line.
808;Rest assured I won't be alone.
809;And this time I will be there without the popcorn and soda!
810;i believe that saving private ryan was one of the best movies of the year which was 1998 and i will never forget how well tom hanks acted magnificently
811;Every one has the potential of making a good movie many don't use that potential.
812;Steven really used it to its fullest and went above the call of duty.
813;This movie seems less like a film and more like a war and that's what Steven set out to do and accomplished that.
814;The story takes you into the eyes of the soldiers of D. day and then all over Germany.
815;This is the most realistic war movie ever depicted.
816;i give would give this the highest honor is story telling to date.
817;The war scenes are great and there is probably around an hour's worth of action in this film alone.
818;The graveyard scenes that frame the movie, for example, don't really ring true when you realize how undeveloped the relationship between Captain Miller and Private Ryan is in the film, but the scene is somehow moving, in an artificial way.
819;If I want to be taught a lesson by Steven Spielberg, I'll write him a letter and ask him.
820;Gross injustice is the best way I can describe the snub.
821;All in all the film is an amazing portal into the Normandy invasions and spares us the Hollywood glitz that too many war movies in the past have shown.
822;Tom Hanks best role and Stephen Spielbers finest moment on the silver screen.
823;The tandem is golden and certainly showed in the follow up Band of Brothers.
824;This ranks in my top 5 films of all time.
825;Words cant express its emotional stranglehold on your heart and soul.
826;Should make for some mind blowing viewing.
827;My headline offers a subjective question, but I think most people would at least agree this is one of the best war movies they've seen, especially if they have a pretty decent 5.1 surround sound system.
828;is an astounding movie experience.
829;The visuals are outstanding, too, and we'll see a Blu.
830;ray version of this film soon, making it even better.
831;I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully.
832;three hour film is riveting start.
833;finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, maybe the most dramatic in the history of film.
834;by the way, is this the best war movie ever made: yeah, I think so.
835;Spielberg cleverly marketed the film as a love story to WWII vets, so who would dare criticize it?
836;My advice is, see it in the theatre.
837;these things really do upset the atmosphere.
838;To appreciate the movie, you must be immersed in it.
839;The scenes on Omaha Beach were especially effective.
840;I will comment on the included documentary, however.
841;Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's biggest director's and has made many great films but however Saving Private Ryan stands out from all the rest.
842;Saving Private Ryan, his film of a mission following the D. day invasion that many have called the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever.
843;With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war.
844;His mother recently received all 3 telegrams with a chaplin and an officer arriving at her doorstep on a remote farm.
845;Miller's men set out to find Private Ryan against all odds which features a certain style about the film that doesn't make out a typical hollywood film.
846;This film also boasts alot of big stars including, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and many other familiar faces.
847;the movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar.
848;winning Schindler's List, but it's more kinetic.
849;The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose.
850;Saving Private Ryan touches us deeper than Schindler because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today.
851;It's the film Spielberg was destined to make.
852;An unforgettable experience that won't be forgotten.
853;I put this movie up there with A Band of Brothers and Gettysburg .
854;It is well acted by Tom Hanks and makes one feel the emotions that go on with troops durning an engagement.
855;He was so happy with it.
856;This is the best movie to me!
857;Spielberg made this movie VERY real and the script makes the movie with cool battles, situations, and characters.
858;I love to hear as much as i can about WW2 movies games etc. but when this came out i knew it was my mission to see it.
859;They manage to get through the devistation that awaits them on the beach and set out for Private Ryan whose two brothers were also killed , and the Army decided to give him Honorable Discharge as an act of good will towards him and his family.
860;This is one of my husband's favorite movies.
861;He enjoyed watching it along with our two 12 year old grandsons.
862;watch this film if you have any respect or appreciation for the sacrifices that have been made by the greatest generation for many of us privileged few today.
863;This film is brilliantly done, from opening scene till close it grabs you and pulls you in so you're in the lives of these men, you feel for these men and you understand their pain and you may even cry for these men.
864;If you thought Tom Hanks knocked it out the park in Forrest Gump you NEED to see him here.
865;ANd Tom SIzemore gives the BEST performance of his carreer.
866;I promise you that from start to finish you will be obsorbed by the power this film has and be happy you watched.
867;for our survival or a person who dissagress and deems it a lack of respect for human life you will still appreciate this film for what it is, because regardless of how you feel about the cause you will still be moved by these MEN and there COURAGE under fire.
868;Spielberg is arguably the greatest director ever, and indisputably the most influential (one need not look further than the preponderance of escapist films made after the 70's).
869;the movie commences with a trip down memory lane, as we see an old man and his family clearly in distress.
870;held oscillations of the camera to convey a sense of presence to the scene.
871;The jarring immediacy of death.
872;Yes some of his movies are flawed, or are simply bad, and yes at times he values style over substance, some of which even lack the former, and yes he has made tons of money
873;I leave with a simple message: the greatness of a movie, a director, or indeed any art, lies in its ability to change a person.
874;If one leaves a movie with an altered perception of things, perhaps a heightened understanding, then that work of art is indeed great.
875;read the book beyond the beachhead, and stephen ambrose's d. day history.
876;A wonderful powerful start is diminished by the typical sentimentality that so often prevents Spielberg's more serious efforts from achieving greatness.
877;It is the best of the best.
878;This is the best war film (or ties with Black Hawk Down) that I've seen.
879;Throw in Barry Pepper as my favorite character, the hothead, religious sniper, Vin Disel as Private Caparzo, and Jermy Davis as the corpral, as they storm Dog Green sector of Omaha beach.
880;this is a great, probably the best war movie ever, the Omaha beach we saw wasn't real, but it looked that way.
881;i have to say, I'm not a fan of Speilberg, (I liked Minority Report), but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
882;I ordered the widescreen edition and I was shipped a full screen.
883;Saving Private Ryan is the best, if not one of the best war films ever made.
884;It certainly is realistic and intense enough to be.
885;Tom Hanks delivers a fine performance as the captain of an army unit.
886;Director Steven Spielberg creates the film which some say he was born to make.
887;ryan, starts out with the D. day Invasion, which is filmed so realistically and is truly one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.
888;That scenes alone earns the film the R rating.
889;The film features an ensemble cast of great actors, from Tom Sizemore to Edwards Burns, to Matt Damon, to Vin Diesel, to Barry Pepper to Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg.
890;released in February of 1999, this film does feature excellent battle sequences which are very realistic and well done for being a 1998 release.
891;it's easy to see why this film won 5 Academy Awards at the Academy Awards in March of 1999.
892;It won the award for Best Director, which it truly deserved.
893;There have been other great war movies including Black Hawk Down, Platoon and We Were Soldiers but none as good as Saving Private Ryan.
894;Spielberg's direction is assured and powerful in crafting this masterful war epic.
895;The acting is superb and the script is sharp.
896;released in theatres again, because it's that good.
897;I'm so happy to add this our collection!
898;for Vin Diesel fans, his role was exclusively created by Spielberg for his moments of glory in the movie.
899;A classic trademark of Spielberg.
900;Hanks doesa great job acting, and Spielbhgerg does a fantastic job of directing this great movie!
901;World War movie is the best one ever made.
902;The acting and directing are whst you expect from Hanks and Spielberg.
903;One of the most intense, moving stories I have ever seen
904;and to tell the truth that begening battle was one of the best I had ever seen.
905;I just dont feel its worth the own, I got this movie right when it came out and have only watched it once and did a partiel viewing of it another time.
906;As in List, This well developed movie stars Tom Hanks as the leader who goes and searches for the titled Character.
907;A antiwar film/epic at its best.
908;Spielberg proved to me that he can still direct great movies all of the time.
909;Its his best since List and not as long.
910;This is the best movie i saw in a long time, i am still amazed after the 2nd time i see it.
911;It had an excellent cast and was so well done.
912;It was one of the most realistic war scenes I had seen, up to that point, chilling!!
913;In situations like those encountered in war lasting friendships are made without knowing a great deal about those with whom you share common hardships.
914;What comes through, most vividly, is that war is terrible and senseless.
915;Spielberg just cannot be outdone in making incredible blockbuster movies and he definitely succeeded with Saving Private Ryan.
916;He shows the violent reality of war through a captivating story, awesome cinematography and special effects, and great acting from Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore.
917;I'm a pretty big fan of war movies.
918;all of the actors fit their roles perfectly, and Tom Hanks is simplu put, amazing.
919;this is a very good ww2 movie, so if you like war stuff even slightly, youll get a lot from this.
920;it was good it was good.
921;Steven Speilberg has effectively created an image that should haunt anyone who sees it.
922;I slept very well that night, knowing that I had given money to honor the bravest people that I'll never know.
923;I hope that you'll do the same.
924;Since Schindler's List, it has slowly dawned on me that Steven Spielberg may be our greatest director.
925;Spielberg has tackled films from varied genres and has succeeded in most of the endeavors he has attempted.
926;enactment of the invasion of Normandy Beach may be the most powerful scene ever transferred to film.
927;After, opening your film with such an effective salvo how do you top it?
928;Aside from Spielberg's solid direction, what bonds this film together is another sterling effort by Tom Hanks (yes, he is our greatest actor).
929;Ultimately, this film is a tribute to the servicemen who selflessly won this war.
930;Was everything I wanted, I got it right away.
931;i was extremely pleased from start to finish.
932;There are some amazing action sequences in this film, most notably its famous Omaha Beach battle scene.
933;This, in turn, adds another dimension to the scenes of the decision.
934;felt desire to rescue Mrs. Ryan's last son and return him to his mother?The character of Upham (Jeremy Davies) is particularly fascinating.
935;heart that many lesser films have settled for.
936;WWII was perhaps the defining moment of this century and certainly for those born during the first quarter of it.
937;Kudo's to Steven Spielberg for producing this masterpiece.
938;The war film to end all war films, Great movie and sound, The first 20mins will stay with you forever
939;I liked the movie very much
940;I have, also, The War by Ken Burns and The Pacific by some other group of producers.
941;He said that it was graphic and powerful.
942;When the Jewish character struggles in an epic one on one struggle with a German soldier, it is emotionally powerful.
943;it includes lots of really good stuff including an interview with my favorite historian, Stephan Ambrose.
944;Very refreshing getting a pro military movie out of Hollywood.
945;Movie well done with great special effects.
946;Should have won the Best Picture that year.
947;It had incredible camera work and the characters had some(but not much) depth to them.
948;Spielberg does a great job setting everything up and Tom Hanks was AMAZING in his part, as were all the other actors.
949;This was one amazing movie, and it really shows you what war does to people.
950;This is without doubt the most moving, involving and graphically disturbing film I have ever seen.
951;Hanks is at his best, but the supporting cast made the film unforgettable
952;spielberg sets out to show us the limits of the humanspirit during war, and the amazing endurance of thosethat lived through some of mankind's most impossibledays ever known.
953;It's not a geniusfilm, but it's powerful and very very good.
954;I am humble by the pure show of bravery of these soldiers, and by the way Spielberg is able to convey it in this movie.
955;minute motion picture I've ever seen!
956;mr. Spielberg has created an amazing portrait of World War 2 here.
957;It's a powerful and moving film.
958;Excellent film about the hardship of being forced to fight for your life againest real enemy.
959;My husband enjoyed it very much he liked he present very much.
960;It brought great joy to him.
961;Excellent film about a team of Rangers during World War II who are ordered to find the sole survivor of four brothers after the Army learns that three have been killed in combat.
962;This feature is famous for its D. day sequence, which established a new standard for realism with detailed production values that propel viewers into WWII.
963;Steven Spielberg direction is great and maybe his great direction of film besides Catch Me If You Can which was good.
964;Tom Hanks is great as the commanding officer whose pushed to the edge because of the war.
965;Matt Damon is good in a small role as the title character.
966;Ed Burns, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, and Jeremy Davis are great as Hanks' squad.
967;Guest appearance performances by Paul Giamatti and Ted Danson are also good.
968;The action scenes are intense and breathetaking.
969;This is one of the greatest World War II movies ever.
970;The opening Omaha Beach Dog Green sector was great.
971;I loved the story line.
972;i found my mind wondering in this period, but my attention was once again grabbed when they finally found private ryan and they began planning what could possibly have been their final stand.
973;overall i enjoyed the movie.
974;Steven Spielberg's 1998 World War II epic pays due homage to the heroism and sacrifice of those who served in the European theatre of the war.
975;based loosely on the story of the Sullivan Brothers, this story features all the realistic grittiness of war, and presents audiences with a fuller truth about war than its 1962 counterpart, The Longest Day.
976;I rarely give 5 stars, but this movie is the most realistic movie I have ever seen (desrving 5 stars) which also happens to offer plenty of opportunities to explore meaning.
977;I do not encourage my friends to see it unless they are prepared to be traumatized, really want to experience great movie making, or want to be challenged with WHY, WHY, and the WHY's of life.
978;It has survived a toddler and a move.
979;In fact, Spielberg revels in the violence, and he takes us along for the ride.
980;Spielberg is at his best when he entertains us with luxurious action sequences, and stays away from questions of morality, (regardless of Schindler's List, which is also deeply problematic).
981;Thanks Amazon for a great site and the total ease of purchasing videos.
982;, the Sniper with a southern accent, the tough as nails Sergeant with a heart of gold (hmmm, maybe Whoopi could have played that role.)
983;the staging of the combat scenes is amazing and worth the price of admission, but don't expect a great story.
984;Saving Private Ryan is first cooperation of director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks as main actor.
985;the mission to save Private Ryan is a grueling and emotional one, resulting in one of the best World War II movie ever made.
986;this movie is the technical masterpiece, with its battle scenes, special effects, sound editing and camera work probably cannot be compared to any other.
987;john Williams' score is great, especially the final score Hymn for the Fallen.
988;This is a excellent piece of music which does honor to men pictured in this movie.
989;is an astounding movie experience.
990;The sound in this film elevates it even higher.
991;the visuals are outstanding, too.
992;greens look this good .
993;perfect colors for the bombed French city where final hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the soldiers, the machinery, the smoke.
994;I highly recommend this movie.
995;They are volunteers in two elite units: the Rangers, and the 101st Airborne.
996;Spielberg's treatment of one of the Rangers' attacks near Vierville (the visually more spectacular escalade of Pointe Du Hoc is treated in _The Longest Day_) is literally stunning.
997;It acquires the fatalism found in the memoirs and interviews of draftees.
998;The film is worth seeing, and worth owning.
999;Tom Hanks is excellent and his character is nicely developed, while the action sequences are second to none.
1000;But ultimately Saving Private Ryan is like so many war movies I saw as a kid, regardless of how well rendered.
1001;The opening scene (after the shlocky frame) as they storm the beach at Normandy is pretty awful.
1002;You get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice.
1003;Such a lovely way to fight a war.
1004;Spielberg makes this point with the wide.
1005;How they were able to capture what it sounds like under water is remarkable.
1006;Right at the beginning, the viewer is carried into the deep truths of war and all that means.
1007;This is one of the true classic productions of our time.
1008;it also won 2 golden globes and 5 oscars in 1998.
1009;now for the good parts that were offer in this movie is its technical achievment in sound effects as well as visual effects which played a major part in the first 25 minutes in the movie at Omaha Beach.
1010;Probably has more to do with Apple's airplay mirroring functionality.
1011;Again this probably is a chrome specific issue, prime would most likely work best on the IE browser.
1012;Tom Hanks is wonderful as always and Matt Damon does a superb job as the 4th Ryan brother.
1013;This movie looks really good on Blue.
1014;And it came at a pretty good price.
1015;To me, this movie was Spielberg at his best.
1016;Every scene was superbly shot, showing how very skillful a director Spielberg is.
1017;This movie deserved to get the Oscar for Best Picture last year.
1018;While there are parts in which there is a lot of blood, these scenes are so realistic they make the war seem real.
1019;The characters are interesting, and the acting superb.
1020;All in all, a superb movie.
1021;This film has become a classic for combat realism and intensity.
1022;for many years I considered THE LONGEST DAY, the best film about the Normandy invasion during WWII.
1023;That was an excellent film for its time, but this Spielberg production takes the invasion and ensuing days to a much more intense, gut.
1024;wrenching level, with a story that not only is based in fact but also shows the horrors of combat in a way that few films ever have.
1025;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN develops the characters in such a way that any harm that befalls them has a greater impact on the audience than most war films.
1026;there are a number of breakout performances by this star.
1027;Tom Hanks EARNED his Oscar for best actor.
1028;His performance as Captain John Miller was BETTER THAN spot on
1029;while other excellent war films have been made since this one was released in '98, such as BLACKHAWK DOWN and the HBO series BAND OF BROTHERS, this one will rank at the top of anyone's list of gripping war stories for years to come.
1030;the extras in this set are top notch as well.
1031;it was sealed and in excellent condition.
1032;very satisfied with the price.
1033;And everyone knew who they were.
1034;My Mom taught me to pray for them as a boy, and I found myself connected to them as if I had known them despite them being KIA in 1944.
1035;I was just doing my job and The real heroes didn't come home are among what I was told.
1036;But it's the closest, based upon what I've been told, and what I've seen, we'll ever get to being among those men who went into that war.
1037;As one who has lost two close family in that war, it is so close to what I saw and have heard that I can't help but cry every time I see it.
1038;it brings home those sacrifices given by young men a long time ago and gives those like me a way to mourn them.
1039;And I find that helps me to do justice for them.
1040;It in no way glorifies war but does give us a sense of appreciation, which is much needed.
1041;A wonderful work of art
1042;The consensus of many after viewing it was that it was too bloody, and they were unsure as to who the audience for it were, and who would want to see it.Yet such was the calibre of the film, a day or so later these opinions had mostly been revised, and it was felt that this was indeed a WW2 film which packed a powerful message.
1043;from my perspective, Saving Private Ryan works brilliantly in its depiction of war.
1044;The effect is dramatic, giving the viewer the sensation of actually being in the battles depicted.
1045;While many old soldiers have faulted technical aspects of the film, they largely agree that it one of the few films to actually depict in a realistic fashion, the confusion and chaos of battle.
1046;The result is a mix of the real and surreal which works stunningly.
1047;The acts of individuals at certain points determine the outcome as opposed to planning, direction, and strategy.
1048;It is as simple as that.
1049;this is absolutely first class moviemaking
1050;This is definitely one of the most outstanding movies of our times.
1051;Besides the subject matter, actors, photography, direction and scope, this movie is well worth the watch and cost for the Blu.
1052;The clarity and the reality of was is right in your face!
1053;You really feel as if you are one of the guys carrying the pack next to your buddy.
1054;I bought it and had a group of friends over to watch it.
1055;Within two weeks each of them bought the movie for themselves as they felt it was a classic everyone should have on their shelves.
1056;well done scenes, shows as well as any what underfire islike.
1057;good drama storyline as well.
1058;I believe Saving Private Ryan is the best movie ever made.
1059;Tom Hanks is in one of his best roles, with one of the greatest supporting cast ever, particulary Tom Sizemore,and Edward Burns.
1060;Director Steven Spielberg's masterpiece in my mind, and a great dramatic score, by John Williams, and simply a great story, along with the best and most realistic battle footage ever!
1061;This movie really touches me after each viewing.
1062;And a very fitting interactive menus.
1063;Mr. Spielberg won his second Oscar for Best Director for this incredibly detailed War epic.
1064;Saving Private Ryan did win 5 Oscars, 4 of which were for technical achievements: Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing.
1065;The 5th Oscar went to Spielberg for bringing all these great elements together.
1066;For the most part the acting is solid, with only a couple standout performances.
1067;Tom Hanks is good here, without ever becoming overbearing in the midst of the chaos.
1068;reflective and philosophical than is usual for a lead character in a War film, which makes his performance all the more interesting.
1069;Tom Sizemore, always the professional supporting actor, is the tough.
1070;minded soldier holding everyone together with his immense presence.
1071;The realistic battle sequences are intense and terrifying.
1072;That is just one of many gut.
1073;footage edited into the film for more realism.
1074;This is a technical masterpiece from one of the greatest film directors of all.
1075;time, and quite possibly the greatest War film yet made.
1076;I doubt I can add a new angle, but wished to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional Steven Spielberg film.
1077;Spielberg definitely hooks his audience, even though (and I've seen this film several times) I find myself grimacing and looking away from some of the most disturbing carnage.
1078;The journey to find Private Ryan's outfit, and then one final confrontation with German forces before Ryan can be removed, is riveting, compelling, horrific.
1079;The action is powerful but never pretentious, and once again, extraordinarily realistic (including a knife fight when a German soldier, his face dripping with sweat, attempts to calm his American victim as the knife enters his chest).
1080;All of the cast is exceptional, headlined by Tom Hanks as platoon leader Captain Miller.
1081;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is an elite epic, and when combined withSchindler's ListSpielberg has paid everlasting homage to World War II.
1082;it's about a family with no father that 3 out of 4 sons were killed in the war, and the youngest is to be saved by a group of unique and wonderful soldiers.
1083;It's a beautiful story, beautifully told.
1084;I loved that movie, seen it 5 times already and nuking some more popcorn to see it again.
1085;They are separate issues, and it is possible to critique this film while still holding that America had a special role in the defining historical moment of the 20th century.
1086;The last point here is important because much has been made of Spielberg's recreation of the Normandy invasion, seen as impressive in its realism and its scale.
1087;But despite the technical bravado and the sheer amount of work that went in to pulling the scene off, Spielberg approaches the invasion with all the subtlety and seriousness of a child.
1088;There's little here that is dramatically compelling, and most of the opening half hour actually has no weight .
1089;Saving Private Ryan is, at best, a severely flawed and problematic film.
1090;making, could still learn a great deal about handheld camera work from a number of directors and cinematographers, including Truffaut and Kalatozishvili.
1091;From what is undoubtedly the most realistic filming of the D. day landings made to date
1092;This movie is one of my favorites.
1093;I've seen a lot of movies, but this one is best.
1094;There is a lot of blood and gore, but if you can handle that and are into WWII, you'll love this movie!
1095;It's action packed from beginning to end and has many good actors, including Tom Hanks.
1096;The characters are great, too.
1097;There are some very tense moments, and the movie makes you feel like you're on Omaha beach, or in a small town in France called Vierville .
1098;Movie is as realistic as can be.
1099;I remember working in the DotCom field in the Silicon Valley, going to see this movie on opening day.
1100;making, nitpicking it, and generally being a loser after the movie was over while friends smoked cigarettes in the parking lot.
1101;This movie touches so many nerves, makes things so real, I am at a loss for words.
1102;But the portrayal of the men, while limited in depth compared to the intimacy of knowledge men have of each other in real combat, is accurate, and I am an expert on such a thing.
1103;It's like modern war video games in that the actual simulation of combat itself is NOT accurate, but the emotional experience that it offers you is.
1104;If you want to watch a movie and have a reaction that really is indicitive of what it's like to witness front.
1105;but it's still the right thing.
1106;Spielberg is a wonderful human being for making this movie.
1107;this film puts it all in context.
1108;A squad of eight men led by Captain Miller (played admirably in a sober and sombre performance by Tom Hanks) set out to find Private Ryan at the frontline.
1109;As in the parable of the lost sheep, this small group risk their lives for one man's life, only to find Ryan is infused with a remarkable sense of duty.
1110;I think she'd understand that A masterfully told story and a timely reminder of how well served the world can be by a nation dedicated to democratic ideals.
1111;A must have for surround sound systems, GREAT movie with great performances!
1112;this was a great movie on wwII.
1113;great movie, great actors, tom hanks was great!
1114;A great film but, of course, bloody!
1115;Tom Hanks is awesome in this movie.
1116;This why this is taking place.
1117;and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage.
1118;it is a very powerful movie.
1119;the best war picture ever.
1120;still unsurpassed in realism and impact on a spellbound audience.
1121;based movies generally, but with a few exceptions, the star.
1122;studded cast is at their individual best.
1123;I find it somewhat amusing to read all the previous reviews of this movie.
1124;The film's just telling it like it was.
1125;i feel that this film depicts the realities of combat and what it does to men better than just about anything made previously.
1126;this film is absolutely brilliant filmmaking.
1127;He reminds me of Hitchcock at the height of his powers in the late 50's early 60's.
1128;this film is riveting from beginning to end.
1129;Every scene, every shot, every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated with the overall artistic vision of the film.
1130;I have a degree in Film Criticism and have seen a lot of film.
1131;speilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be considered a tired genre.
1132;held, chaotic filming of the Omaha Beach landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the best in cinema history.
1133;The payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the battle to hold the bridge.
1134;one beautifully crafted sequence (of many) is setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old man's blue eyes to Tom Hank's shaking hand at the Omaha landing.
1135;When you see the final crossfade from Pvt. Ryan's face to the old man's face (beautifully done) it comes full circle.
1136;This subversion of a typical film convention is what makes Tom Hank's final scene so incredibly moving.
1137;speilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of film, he has become a consumate artist, using his film making skills with intelligence, sensitivity and confidence.
1138;I have just bought the best war film on Blu Ray and it is utterly amazing.
1139;Since the movie is one of my favorite movies, i just had to get it in high definition.
1140;The movies picture and sound is amazing along with the amazing storyline.
1141;I recommend this War Classic to anybody that has a Blu Ray player.
1142;But the best way to own Saving Private Ryan is on Blu Ray.
1143;Attention to detail in an accurate depiction of men caught in a moment of history that will be studied for centuries.
1144;a search is conducted by a squad of men who are asked to undertake a seemingly futile task after surviving the harrowing landing on Normandy.
1145;a leader near the end of his rope is compelling, while the opening and closing sequences will bring even the most hard bitten tough guys to the edge.
1146;probably the most important movie of this decade.
1147;One and only great film that came from Spielberg.
1148;face war epic I have ever experienced.
1149;But Saving Private Ryan is much more than that, as it gives us a well.
1150;developed story line and characters we come to care about during the natural unfolding of the story.
1151;creation ever put to film, this ensemble of American soldiers and the film itself slow down to catch their breath and hand us a great story, having now prepared us for it.
1152;The heroic everyman types that comprise this small band are fleshed out as they go through their mission to find Private Ryan.
1153;What is so important about Private Ryan?
1154;See the film and you will find out.
1155;Saving Private Ryan is one of the best and most captivating films of any genre that I have ever experienced.
1156;The actor's uniforms, the dirt crusted into their finger nails and face.
1157;The particles and fragments flying around after an explosions and bullets wizzing by all bring this movie to a new level.
1158;With the visuals and the amazing sound I felt like I was running around with them, taking cover while enemy fire was cracking by my head.
1159;If you are even thinking about getting it, do yourself a favor and just get it.
1160;Saving Private Ryan was a good movie.
1161;A good story line, keeps the viewer engrossed.
1162;Still despite some oversights it was a good movie.
1163;the greatest ww2 movie ever made with a story that cannot leave a dry eye.
1164;tom hanks has made a wonderful work on this film and I strongly recommend it.
1165;Saving Private Ryan feels so real at times, you think you are in the middle of a battle.
1166;The action sequences are extremely intense, and are not for the weak of heart.
1167;The movie is very moving, and should be seen by everyone.
1168;It will make you cherish the things that we sometimes take forgranted.
1169;i'm certainly not a war movie officionado, but SPR was excellent.
1170;Tom Hanks was, as usual, believable and inspiring in his role.
1171;make sure you pay attention to the letter.
1172;I am adding a film or two from all the wars, that gives an excellent portrayal.
1173;Also considered are ones like this that the direction, story and acting all are right on.
1174;I was there in Normandy over the D. day period and through the Summer Solstice it is a wonderful time to visit Normandy.
1175;But it can get chilly and be prepared for some rain, but a great place to visit and you will see how in some places the vistas look similar to what you see in this film.
1176;But photos and history is everywhere, while the this time of year its light till almost Midnight, Museums and such close at normal hours.
1177;And I was comfortable in France and made to feel welcome, in Paris I think people are so involved with themselves they are rude as a way of survival.
1178;New Yorkers will feel at home with the Subway's, though clean Restroom's some even work's of art, are a bit of a mind blowing experience.
1179;Saving Private Ryan is a movie that we have all seen too many times.
1180;I will follow up with a real review in the future.
1181;For now, I wanted to answer a question posed by an earlier review.
1182;The demeanor of the two also differ.
1183;After Miller tells him that he can help bury the bodies, the screen freezes for a full second during the close.
1184;Of course, the movie is a classic and a 5/5.
1185;It's amazing how a movie from 1998 can look so fantastic in blu.
1186;Totally recommended for everyone interested in this fantastic movie and blu.
1187;This movie is perfect, the picture and sound is incredible i recommend!Just a tip for brazilian costumers the movie have subtitle in pt.
1188;technically, the movie is good in some parts.
1189;The action portrayed at the begining is quite decent, with some vivid details such as the deaf moments aiming to bring us closer to the sensations of a real war.
1190;That's why i give it two stars.
1191;As simple as in a Batman comic.
1192;fortunately, great movies like Stalingrad and Apocalypse Now have shown us that war is more than a collection of guys with lethal weapons sweeping around other guys, labeled as bad.
1193;There you get in touch with the concealed part of the war, emotions and feelings which also count.
1194;It could have been a great movie, because technically speaking, it is quite well done (screenplay, etc.) but it ends in being rather pathetic.
1195;The reality is it's frightening.
1196;War has never been so realistic.
1197;Great movie based on historical event and those involved and actors.
1198;Worth getting through amazon if you like Tom Hanks and the rest of the actors.
1199;When I first saw this I heaped praise on this movie, calling it best war movie ever, etc. etc.
1200;And those were great fight scenes.
1201;before i viewed this movie, i honestly knew very little on world war 2.
1202;i rememer the whole movie experience exactly.
1203;i, for one, learned a lot from this movie experience.
1204;I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in WWII movies
1205;One of the greatest war movies ever made, if not THE greatest.
1206;While watching this movie again, I was reminded how amazing it was.
1207;This is an absolutely amazing flick that has to be seen.
1208;the story of a small platoon of marines travelling across France trying to find a Private James Ryan, is an interesting one.
1209;Yes, there are many battles and they are very well done.
1210;The D. day invasion at the beginning of the movie is one of the most famous and incredible scenes in movie history.
1211;The end battle is also a great piece of movie making.
1212;It has heart and action.
1213;This is probably my favorite Spielberg film and I think I wouldn't be alone on that thought.
1214;Hanks, of course, steals the show as the lead here.
1215;He is probably the best actor of my generation and he was on a serious role during the late 90's.
1216;I have always thought Burns was a bit overrated, but he is impressive here.
1217;Sizemore and the rest of the platoon are all memorable and likeable characters.
1218;there are many moments where I was surprised by the nice shots that I was looking at.
1219;There is one shot where the guys are walking at night and the explosions off in the distance light up the screen.
1220;It is an absolutely amazing shot and there are many more of these moments in the movie.
1221;Spielberg really impressed me with how he shot this movie.
1222;Is has it's grainy, washed out look while still looking gorgeous at the same time.
1223;Like I said, Speilberg was at the top of his game here.
1224;is this the best war film ever made?
1225;I think Platoon and Apocalypse Now are also very good.
1226;This movie just has more heart and substance to it.
1227;It looks amazing, sounds amazing and the acting is top.
1228;The story is very interesting and it has the best of the best directing it.
1229;special Features: Well, we finally have a special edition of this flick.
1230;It's very well put together and I guess I couldn't complain too much.
1231;One of the best war movies I've ever seen.
1232;The acting, filming are both fantastic.
1233;It depicts world war II very well.
1234;By endeavoring to create a War move, whatever that means, it is the director's responsibility to treat it with care and maturity.
1235;Powerful and heartbreaking at times.
1236;It covers realistic dilemas of war and gets the viewer to appreciate that war isn't simply about glory and victory.
1237;american face in this movie.
1238;I've seen him in other film, and He's a very good and likable actor.
1239;This DTS edition is a must see for any mature person.
1240;This film can't be compared to any other films because it is so well done.
1241;He saved us and bought us at a high price.
1242;All we have to do is accept his gift to us.
1243;I have seen this movie twice and will watch it occasionally the rest of my life.
1244;Tom Hanks did his usual great job of bringing his character to life.
1245;Spielberg, the great movie maker, also has the special talent of showing the greatness of the characters in his films.
1246;This is definately the greatest war movie made to date, but it's also a fine tribute to the greatest generation of people that ever lived.
1247;Yes, it's got great color, the most realistic war scenes, great sound, great stunts, etc, but this is a movie about ordinary people doing what has to be done.
1248;ray disc looks and sounds amazing.
1249;ray discs, nevertheless, it is a great movie.
1250;from the opening cemetery scene to the climactic battle,the crispness of the images is improved.
1251;The one I've found seems appropriate ,I believe it sums up the essence and the messages of this extraordinary movie.Yes, it's one of my favorite movies , I don't know anybody that hasn't seen and admired it .
1252;I felt throughout the film in great debt to all those soldiers that had fought the nazis, and helped shaping the world as we know it today .
1253;when Captain Miller'd said in the end Earn this ,earn it I felt like it was addressed directly to me, and that as a person that has earned the right to live thanks to the western victory ,should I transcend myself from all those pitiful everyday problems of mine to accomplish something good, real good in my life.
1254;I've thought a great deal about it in the couple of years since I've seen the movie .
1255;I have this notion in my mind, and I'll keep on trying.
1256;Williams succeeded in seizing the entire diversity of emotions ,feeling and sentiments the movie had delivered in the best possible expression.
1257;I admire his creation as much as I admire the movie 
1258;It's the most intensive track ,the main theme ,if you may .
1259;The song integrates so harmonically with the progress of events in the movie ,that you can't help yourself from falling in love with it instantly, unquestionably.
1260;the scense of death is strong in this film ,the realism is the highest I've ever encountered.
1261;This is a great achievement of Spielberg, the director, and I think that he's accomplished his initial goals with this astounding film .
1262;This is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen, but mind you, I couldn't sit through Schindler's List .
1263;The cinematography is magnificent, though and Tom Hanks is wonderful.
1264;One of the all time great war movies.
1265;The Longest Day made many years ago was one of the finest films of its time.
1266;So many wonderful actors in this film, particularly Tom Hanks who probably portrays one of his finest roles.
1267;It is an incredible movie and shows the true power and strength of war (this isn't rambo).
1268;When Saving Private Ryan first hit the theaters, a big splash was made over the amount of graphic violence the film contained.
1269;For that, if nothing else (and you'd best not forget how shatteringly realistic the battle scenes are), this is the greatest war film ever made.
1270;the film's opening D. day sequence is easily the most highly praised segment of SPR (or any film released that same year, for that matter), and it's no wonder.
1271;The invasion is a twenty.
1272;after this gutsy opening sequence, we settle down to the main story.
1273;Eight men, led by Captain John Miller (played by Tom Hanks), are sent for this task, with some of them questioning the logic and ambiguity behind such a mission.
1274;director Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job crafting the film as both an anti.
1275;Every actor here delivers exemplary performances
1276;As the lead, Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances, a dramatic tour.
1277;force that works simply because he so convincing plays a normal man driven to the extremes by war.
1278;This is probably Hanks most subtle and moving role to date.
1279;It certainly helps he has a well.
1280;written script (courtesy of Robert Rodat) to back him up.
1281;It's because of the characterization that I find the film's climactic battle sequence to be even more intense and moving than the opening segment.
1282;The production is amazing, consisting of war.
1283;The cinematography and editing is among the best I've ever seen, and John Williams' score is a powerful, sorrowful elegy of quiet, rumbling emotions.
1284;Arguably, this is Steven Spielberg's best film, and whether or not he goes on to surpass it remains to be seen.
1285;But hey, five years prior to viewing Saving Private Ryan, I remember telling myself, there's no way he'll ever make another film as powerful as Schindler's List.
1286;Saving Private Ryan makes you proud to be an american.
1287;it is 9/11 and I watched this.
1288;Hard to beat the first 20 or so minutes, which is a (seemingly) realistic depiction of the Normandy landings.
1289;Tom Hanks is superb in the lead as an enigmatic, tough but fair captain leading the typical motley crew on an improbable mission, and Tom Sizemore is terrific as his right hand man.
1290;the images and sounds are very, very realistic.
1291;stephen speilberg is a creative genious.
1292;all the roles were very well acted, and while I do think tom hanks is a good actor, I was surprised at the intensity he showed and realism he gave to the film through his acting.
1293;I won't bother you with the acclaims that SPR has warranted, and yes, they are all worth it.
1294;He gives a strong performance in this role, and you could see his superstar attributes showing here.
1295;As Stanley Kubrick, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone have showed before, war IS hell.
1296;And in 1998, after all the glamorizing of war by actors like Arnold Schwarzenneger and the like, Steven Spielberg joined the fray with his incredible epic SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
1297;though bookended with the aging Private James Ryan and his family visiting a war memorial in France, the film opens with a stunning recreation of the D. day invasion of June 6, 1944, where thousands of troops storm Omaha Beach, led by such fine actors as Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, and Edward Burns.
1298;This stunning sequence, lasting some twenty.
1299;four minutes, ranks right up there with such films as THE WILD BUNCH and FULL METAL JACKET for depicting the sheer horrors of war.
1300;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is, incredibly, yet another masterpiece from the pre.
1301;eminent American film maker of our time.
1302;i love this movie its a good movie shows how they find a bond within each other and find brotherhood and how hard it was to loose one another throughout the movie just to find one man to send home and how they did care about each other and how no matter how tough they were they still worked hard and fought togetheralso the packaging was safe the movies suffered no scratchesand is in perfect condition
1303;Of all the war movies ever made,this came the closest to capturing what it must of been like for the infantry man in WWII.
1304;saving Private Ryan should be required viewing for all people who value liberty and freedom.
1305;Men like those depicted in this movie gave us that liberty and freedom with their heart, souls and in many instances their lives.
1306;Not only superbly casted, filmed, etc. but you also get the feel you might have a balanced view of some real.
1307;life character types and a fair account of what really happened.
1308;the powerful lading seen is a brake throw in movie viewing experience capturing so many emotions and events at the same time is a master piece to add to ones home collection.
1309;more then one viewing to experience this movie
1310;Every war has it's great movies, Civil War had Glory, Vietnam had Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, and World War II has Saving Private Ryan.
1311;tough brave men fighting for our liberty tied in with a compelling story.
1312;Saving Private Ryan is, undoubtedly, a well done motion picture that depicts faithfully the sad reality of a war: it is full of blood, explosions, fire and mutilated human bodies.
1313;but if there is one feature that calls attention is the patriotic appeal of Americans present in this motion picture: the eminent presence of the waving American flag and the idea of risking lives in behalf of the nation, which makes the reaction of Private Ryan kind of surreal, as Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) says in the movie.
1314;this movie is very well done in all aspects.
1315;I highly recommend to those who enjoy war movies, and also those who like a good tragedy with a bit of gore attached (since this could qualify as that).
1316;I enjoyed this movie .
1317;The most realistic gunfire and explosion sound effects I have ever heard on a war film.
1318;There is clearly a difference between Dolby Digital and DTS.
1319;ray high definition movies are equal, this Blu.
1320;In addition, the movie is one the best war movies ever made.
1321;What I love about this movie is the realistic effects (almost zero CGI to make it look fake) and war isn't glorified in this film.
1322;It's a really solid story that tugs hard at the heartstrings.
1323;This is one of those movies that, when it's over, makes you feel physically exhusted.
1324;Maybe Das Boot and Bridge On The River Kwai can stand next to this one, but few others can even approach it's greatness.
1325;The only downbeat is the heroic death of Hanks, romanticised for the Hollywood crowd.
1326;Goes to prove why Spielberg is the premiere director of our, and maybe of all, time.
1327;Definitely the best film of 1998, despite what those morons in the Academy say.
1328;The title gives the ending away!
1329;Aside from the spoiler, this is my favorite movie.
1330;I came in, like most, with knowledge of the horror of WWII, and all the movie did was affirm this knowledge.
1331;This is the best war movie I watch it all the time.
1332;This movie will make you FEEL like you are right there on the battle field.
1333;A Speilberg movie, so the cinematography and techniques he uses are top of the line and add incredible drama to the story.
1334;This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time.
1335;It was very good, but nowhere near that good.
1336;It probably qualifies as the one of best WWII films made after 1970.
1337;There were dozens of great films with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds.
1338;It is a combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than about Private Ryan himself.
1339;Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is unparalleled.
1340;the entire ensemble cast did a terrific job.
1341;Tom Hanks, as always, was masterful as Captain Miller.
1342;He struck just the right balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were going through, and the hard.
1343;i rated this film an 8/10.
1344;wade's scene had me in tears
1345;He's fighting this German SS soldier guy, and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor.
1346;make it easier for both of us.
1347;who should have been shot when they got a chance, and I agreed with them.
1348;This movie will change their minds.
1349;The first fifteen minutes of this film are some of the best cinema ever made.
1350;The sound effects were an improvement over previous movies I'd seen, and this does a lot to put you right there amid the action.
1351;When you see it, note the sound of the German MG42 machine guns and the crack of the bullets.
1352;Historically, it took most of the day, and casualties ran into the thousands.
1353;it then transitions to an interesting, but not quite outstanding, fictional story about saving the last son of the Ryan family.
1354;A Civil War letter from Abraham Lincoln is read during the movie, a letter which was so moving that I played it over and over.
1355;despite these minor weaknesses, the story is very interesting and, as a big bonus, educational.
1356;I was very moved by what a generation of Americans (and those of other nations also) went through to liberate Europe.
1357;Spielberg made the movie, but the courage and toughness of depression.
1358;This is one of the best Spielberg movies I've ever seen.
1359;it has a magnificent cast.
1360;even though the underlying is abi t questionable the plt is woven intricately and delicately.
1361;the way Ryan(Damon) is finally found took me a bit by surprise.
1362;Telling an amazing story of bravery, Saving Private Ryan is both inspiring and moving.
1363;Despite the dangers and the subsequent deaths of many comrades, they finally complete their mission after one last heroic fight.
1364;The movie flashes forward to the present day Ryan as he kneels at the graves of those brave men who saved him.
1365;With director Steven Speilberg, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and other good character actors, this is a powerful war film with great battle sequences as well as amazing heroism.
1366;This film is that important.
1367;In those films the good guys were good and that was that.
1368;Good soldiers, extraordinary ones actually, die.
1369;Maybe you die today, maybe you don't.
1370;we also see the enemy in a whole new light.
1371;This is the type of question this film makes you think again and again about war and what it means.
1372;to put it simply, the transfer is flawless.
1373;All those releases and this masterpiece in particular, retain their intended look.
1374;the Incredibles kind of colors mind you.
1375;Its more subtle but very noticable.
1376;Now flesh tones look real and defined.
1377;The greens and olives (which dominate the film) look amazing and the bright colors that show up so sparingly now pop even more.
1378;And all that, while retaining the original grain structure of the film.
1379;ray is one of the best transfers of a catalog title of 2010 if not the best so far.
1380;good background with appropriate flashbacks as the darker feature began to develop.
1381;But this one really comes to life.
1382;You feel their courage, you feel their pain, you feel their sorrow, you feel their losses and I especially, though brave, felt their fear.
1383;I have seen many great war movies, but this one is special.
1384;I have always honored our men who have fought in war for our freedom and safety.
1385;But this show takes you on a journey into what their lives were really like while they fought for us.
1386;Things happen so quickly you do the best you can.
1387;It was history told in a touching way.
1388;I loved Tom Hanks performance.
1389;I give this movie all thumbs up!
1390;And through it all, they still came out with a good ending.
1391;The best war film .
1392;Steven Spielberg is a favorite director of mine.
1393;It's a unforgettable film achievement that won five Academy Awards, including best director, but was robbed of the Best Picture award to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.
1394;Nevertheless, this film has had a philosophical and lasting influence to the way war films should match.
1395;war II era based film is loaded with powerful and graphic war scenes and the film's message is profound.
1396;Honor, dignity, and courage is spread throughout the film.
1397;outstanding actor Tom Hanks portrays Captain John Miller who leads his troops through the historic D. day invasion during WWII.
1398;the production values are amazing.
1399;done, it sort of has a documentary feel to it.
1400;The sound is the best I've heard in a film ever!
1401;The D. day intro is absolutely breathtaking.
1402;spielberg made his usual masteriso work into making this the most realistic vision of any war film.
1403;Saving Private Ryan clearly ranks as one of the best motion pictures of all time.
1404;for me, watching the movie brings me a sense of profound humility.
1405;Since that time, I have become ever more interested in the happenings before and during World War II and hopefully have more humility and concern for others.
1406;now about the movie: Tom Hanks was perfect in his role as were all of the supporting actors.
1407;In particular, Sizemore was the perfect sergeant.
1408;This young man played his role flawlessly.
1409;This movie is great, I saw it in the theatre and its just as good a second time around.
1410;I will be returning this disc to Amazon for an exchange, Amazon is always good about things like this.
1411;And after three hours it certainly is.
1412;Tom Hanks does his usual superb acting job
1413;The messages are clear that war is brutal and senseless and inhuman and horrid, but after seeing the film three times I'm thinking that Saving Private Ryan is more about showcasing spectacular special effects (Normandy Beach scenes) than about anything else.
1414;Watch and see if you don't agree.
1415;Opening up gives you two discs with a very good background design with scraps and memorabilia of the Operation Overlord (The Normandy invasion).
1416;a chance to see all the research and diligent work put into making the film as authentic as possible.
1417;This film is simply the best of the war genre.
1418;first, I want to congratulate Spielberg and his crew for giving the most realistic war sequences cinema has ever seen.
1419;Well, I got news for all of you: War is anything but spectactular or outstanding.
1420;that is, if you got the guts to.
1421;Each of those I found to be good, if not great movies.
1422;But for my dollar, Saving Private Ryan captures the most of what I think a war flick should.
1423;The way the marines worked the way up too the beach on the shaky camerawork was brilliant.
1424;But until that day comes, people should stop complaining about how flipping typically American this is and enjoy it for what it is.
1425;It could have ended there and still have been the masterpiece this film is.
1426;Tom Hanks and everyone else in this movie have really made something special.
1427;Like I said, this movie has moments and scenes that are so real, you never forget it.
1428;From heads being blown off to missing limbs, the special effects team did an amazing job in this movie.
1429;From battle scenes to families getting notice that their sons are dead, it captures the moments well.
1430;Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see.
1431;It will always be a reminder that war is hell, but the freedom the soldiers of WW2 gave us through their victory was worth it.
1432;The acting and directing perfectly portrays the gruesomeness of war.
1433;Instant classic and very accurate.
1434;By the end of the film you will have a newfound respect for veterans, especially those who served and died in WW2.
1435;Over all great movie, all the actors are some of my favorite actors of all time.
1436;Steven Spielberg is a proven master of movie making .
1437;The landing is handled with a gritty intensity and it was refreshing to see ( if you can call murder refreshing ) that GI's too are not above shooting surrendering troops.
1438;All very credible in the heat of battle.
1439;given that the director was always going to introduce the 'human element' to pander to the soapie fans I also felt that the uncovering of the Ryan casualties was also tastefully done.
1440;lured in all likelihood one of two SS divisions to their party.
1441;These were canny operators of the highest order and, with the greatest respect to Hanks and his band, would have 'eaten them for breakfast' given their combat experience.
1442;the sudden ( and timely ) intervention of air cover at the end of the action .
1443;A very touching movie, you feel Tom Hanks characters pain as he watches his men give their lives to save Private Ryans,to get him back home to safty.
1444;Heartwarming, a very emotional movie.
1445;Great acting on Tom Hanks and Matt Damiens part indeed.
1446;You won't be disappointed, but you will be touched, and changed by this movie.
1447;The beach front scene is riveting and very realistic.
1448;It speaks well of the horror these brave men faced so many years ago.
1449;this concept of saving Private Ryan, a paratrooper who has lost his three brothers almost in an instant is a great motive for telling this type of story.
1450;If you are to own only one WW2 movie make it this one.
1451;tom Hanks @ his best.
1452;great picture accurate and true.
1453;interesting dialogue is often oblique.
1454;and the other guy answers, Say, you got a extra smoke?
1455;Mind you, in all other respects the dialog was brilliant .
1456;He was superman, Oscar Wilde, James Bond and Tom Hanks rolled in room.
1457;It was like he knew throughout the movie he was going to win the Oscar already.
1458;mind you, lots of what he did was pure genius.
1459;Like all great actors, Hanks has a way of zeroing in on the absolutely correct tone and inflection.
1460;thoughts, and that takes tremendous skill.
1461;the best always in every situation all the time, a Dr. Phil in combat gear.
1462;more of that laterBegins with the Battle of Omaha in all of its horror and raw courage of the American soldiers making the D Day landing.
1463;so good at butchering .
1464;and is somewhat u
1465;so action aficionados will not be disappointed but this movie also has humour, philosophy, drama,and pathosthe ending is a real tearjerker.
1466;The opening 20 minutes or so of Saving Private Ryan are among the greatest ever put on film Ask anyone who's seen the movie about the assault on Omaha Beach and you usually get a response in a hushed voice filled with awe.
1467;that some of the men get off the boats and on the beach is a miracle, and that any survived long enough to engage the enemy is another.
1468;The combat scenes are frantic, exhilarating, of course terrifying.
1469;When Miller and his men finally pull out their weapons you can see the insane pleasure of combat that soldiers often experience, a chance to hit back and kill those who are trying to kill them.
1470;The movie presents the question, is the life of one man worth risking the lives of 8 other men?
1471;as Hanks' squad marches through Normandy looking for Ryan you get some feel for the enormous scope of the invasion, and the confusion of it all.
1472;spielberg and Kaminski do brilliant work here.
1473;The colors in the movie have a faded, washed out appearance, and the camera runs along right next to the soldiers, adding to the powerfully realistic feel.
1474;The man breaks down and asks his wife, Tell me I'm a good man.
1475;jerking appeals to the audience.
1476;What words can convey the thanks and gratitude for the sacrifices made?
1477;Yes, the first 30 minutes are just terrific/horrendous, but it IS the characters and the storyline that make this movie so good.
1478;It's the friends, the bonds, the experiences, the dilemmas, the camraderie, the Mission, that make war so memorable.
1479;Remarkable that Spielberg (a non.
1480;vet) did it so well.
1481;People keep wondering how it came that Spielberg took the OSCAR for best director and not best Film also, what is a pretty good rare occasion.
1482;it's just a film that actually SHOWS what happened to these young men during World War 2.
1483;Sure, there's a couple production errors here and there, but the excellent acting, gritty realism, spectacular musical score and intense action hold your interest throughout.
1484;It's all the more amazing that Spielberg did this entire film without any storyboards whatsoever.
1485;SPR is a great film.
1486;Sometimes it's 2, sometimes it's 4.
1487;Colors, details, etc are great.
1488;This movie was a moving and heartfelt experience, but speaking with him afterwards even moreso.
1489;It opened a lot of discussion about what it was Really like.
1490;Talking about girls, family, their old life.
1491;For those who were looking for more of a documentary, it would be perfect for you.
1492;Saving Private Ryan is less about the specific battles and events and more about the overall effect of the war on people.
1493;This movie depicted that perfectly, in my opinion.
1494;It can be difficult and heartwrenching at times to watch, but I think any movie that can have that effect on you is a movie worth seeing.
1495;The only reason I give this movie so high a rating is because it was well.
1496;This is one of the best war movies in my opinion but make some extra popcorn.
1497;It is a long one but really good.
1498;A great storyline with awesome actors.
1499;They're both the best of the best.
1500;This film marks the first time they worked together.
1501;Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he really made this film that much better.
1502;It shows the affects of war and impact it has on people and their families.
1503;It pays a tribute to all those veterans who fought for our freedom, because freedom doesn't come free.
1504;This film should be viewed by anyone that calls themself an American.
1505;The image of this film is very strong.
1506;So strong that it trigger our other sences!!
1507;I feel like drowning along with Tom Hanks those soliders on screen.
1508;I strongly recommend this to everyone
1509;Without doubt it is the most wrenching, realistic combat sequence ever filmed.
1510;Many of the incidents associated with the landing are lifted from Steven Ambrose's excellent book, D Day, since he was a technical advisor to Speilberg.
1511;Throughout the film the character, courage and depth of American fighting men is exemplified and respected.
1512;india Theater, another on Utah Beach and a third with the 82nd.
1513;In what seems a confusing statement Hank's sergeant says 'This could be the best thing we've ever done.'
1514;That is just one of several mysterious facets that keeps you coming back to the film.
1515;Best War movie in my collection.
1516;I always did like that Movie.
1517;where SPR succeeds brilliantly is that it went for what I call a higher truth.
1518;I think people will watch this film for decades and many will walk away feeling that they have seen war for the first time and will feel respect for those who have endured its fires.
1519;sPR was gypped of the best picture Oscar.
1520;Next to Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan is one of Spielberg's greatest achievments.
1521;The movie deeply impacts the kids of this generation.
1522;My scoop of the day: a) sound effects were above average (they got an Oscar for it)
1523;freq sound effects are quite exceptional
1524;represent the movie, this one actually under.
1525;The scence with the prisoner is amazing.
1526;This is a great movie.
1527;this terrific war film is just now finally coming to blu.
1528;i'm sure there's reasons behind it, and i don't care to find out.
1529;His dedication to the project and respect to the WWII.
1530;The boot camp expert was a key asset to the actors especially.
1531;His brief section alone was very memorable.
1532;a great find and great gift idea.
1533;I never really liked this film when it was released.
1534;The main characters in this film seem liked they were pulled from every WWII movie that Robert Rodat (the screenwriter) and Steven Spielberg saw when they were a child.
1535;Zanuck had served in WWII, and his film is vastly superior.
1536;The Longest Day covered the Normandy invasion in brilliant fashion, covering it with the most meticulous detail.
1537;It seems they land on the beach, a lot of people get killed in gruesome ways, then they're on top of the beach making jokes about the whole thing.
1538;Flags of Our Fathers and The Longest Day really give you a sense of what the planning was, and why they were there.
1539;Spielberg has made a great WWII film, but it isn't this one.
1540;That film is one of Spielberg's greatest, and most underrated, films.
1541;They are all vastly superior films to Private Ryan.
1542;This is simply the greatest war film ever made.
1543;This film is simply brilliant.
1544;Also fantastic is the audio.
1545;The scenery is simply beautiful, with the English Channel in the backround.
1546;They climb over the sides, they jump out the front and into the waist high water.
1547;Again, Speilberg is a genius.
1548;some of the boys make it to the beach.
1549;This movie is simply wonderful.
1550;You'll come away with a whole new respect for those old men you see who 60 years later are still wearing hats with the insignia of their company or batallion on it.
1551;The realism of the battles is astounding, and the story enthralling, even if not entirely accurate.
1552;Not a documentary, but a superb film.
1553;First, I agree with all that see this film as a technical masterpiece.
1554;The battle scenes, sound, hand.
1555;held camera work, and other special effects are incomparable.
1556;many of the historical facts are astoundingly accurate as well.
1557;The details are almost all perfect.
1558;As I watch it, I do feel a sense of awe and wonder that these men would do what they did on D. day (and all the battles of the war).
1559;While our British friends will no doubt be offended by this, there is something unique about the young Americans we see in the opening scene in the Higgins boats .
1560;The film presents this uniquely American mystery to us .
1561;i must also make a positive comment about John Williams' score, especially the final Hymn for the Fallen.
1562;This is a fine piece of music that does honor to these men.
1563;i also can't omit the great and oft.
1564;He merges into the background as a 'leader of grunts'.
1565;its still an outstanding film and one that haunts me to this day.
1566;the movie itself is an incredibly compelling visual and storytelling masterpiece by Steven Spielberg, one of the great war movies of all time.
1567;I'm not a big war movie buff, but this one is special.
1568;The first half hour, which is an incredibly gut.
1569;wrenching portrayal of the invasion of Omaha Beach, is some of the most harrowing and realistic war re.
1570;disc set, ranging from a making of feature to a couple of simple trailers.
1571;half hours, and it's all worth watching, especially the feature.
1572;ray, now is the time to do it!
1573;If you want a real feel for what D Day was like, start with this movie.
1574;Saving Private Ryan should have won an oscar for Best Picture.
1575;The acting, cinematography and sweeping panorama are breathtaking.
1576;We watch this movie every D Day to remember the sacrifices of America's Greatest Generation .
1577;This movie should be required viewing for all, so people can see first.
1578;This is one of the most moving films of our time.
1579;While I loved Hanks in this one, the marvelous supporting cast actually stole the show: the sharpshooter who prays before each shot
1580;I watched this one for the first time in a packed theater, and after that first scene ended, I heard sniffling and looked around me.
1581;This is the first movie I have ever seen that I actually felt I was part of it.
1582;Watching this movie makes you appreciate really appreciate what these guys had to go thru to survive.
1583;The last battle seen in the movie actually gives you butterflies in your stomach!
1584;How this didn't win best picture of the year is still a mystery to me!
1585;If you're for total home theater sound, Saving Pirvate Ryan is for you.
1586;You really feel like you are in a movie theater.
1587;This is the best sound in movie that I own.
1588;This is a very meaningful movie that truely shows how hellish war can be.
1589;If you have a DTS system and love war movies with a meaning you'll love this movie.
1590;Watching Saving Private Ryan was awesome.
1591;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
1592;I'm a twelve year old girl, and I just loved this movie.
1593;I've always been facinated by WW2 and this movie tells and shows the truth.
1594;It's very realistic, and graphic.
1595;VERY SIMPLY STATED:This is the most visceral, in.your.
1596;face war epic I have ever experienced.
1597;But Saving Private Ryan is much more than that, as it gives us a well.
1598;developed story line and characters we come to care about during the natural unfolding of the story.
1599;creation ever put to film, this ensemble of American soldiers and the film itself slow down to catch their breath and hand us a great story, having now prepared us for it.
1600;The heroic everyman types that comprise this small band are fleshed out as they go through their mission to find Private Ryan.
1601;What is so important about Private Ryan?
1602;See the film and you will find out.
1603;Saving Private Ryan is one of the best and most captivating films of any genre that I have ever experienced.
1604;Very happy with the service .
1605;Such a moving movie and the sound effects are so real .
1606;I originally saw this movie in the theatre, and received a suprise the moment the landing craft were heading towards the beach.
1607;this is not just a great war movie, but it is an outstanding anti.
1608;What can I add to review a great movie.
1609;It was good enough to warrant the extra money for BR.
1610;If there is a hell, this movie depicting the reality of war, will make you feel as if you're right in the middle
1611;Steven Spielberg made a anti.
1612;To find one movie which a person says is the best is almost impossible.
1613;After watching Casablanca you may have loved the movie but were you proud to watch it.
1614;Watching Saving Private Ryan you truly developed a sense of love towards the Tom Hanks character, captain John Miller, a person you would want to meet and have you children grow up to be like.
1615;This is simply one great movie with a great story.
1616;Fantastic plot, acting, cinematography, all of it.
1617;Knowing a basic history behind the Normandy invasions also really helps to grasp the film.
1618;The performances were great notably by the great Tom Hanks, and Spielberg's film will always remain a classic.
1619;I visited Normandy months after watching it, and the tour guide informed us that we were at the location where D. day occured.
1620;This movie is a masterpiece, and it shall always be remembered.
1621;It shall be remembered because it reported a historic fact vividly and wonderfully, and sometimes the only way for us to understand what atrocities happened in the past is reproduce these images in a movie.
1622;surprisingly Spielberg has taken the first sight.
1623;And this is an interesting point to remark.
1624;he never tells us story about loosers , nevertheless he always seeks events or edge knife situations where you must face and win.
1625;in Ryan he reminds us the glorious D day .
1626;The special effects are fantastic.
1627;The protrail of capt. Miller by Tom Hanks was a classic.
1628;The corporal who was afraid and hung out on the stairs while one of his friends was killed by an ss soldier was powerful.
1629;The movie reflects on the courage of soldiers of all nations who do their duty.
1630;One of the very enjoyable movies I watch all the time, I think I saw this movies for the 4th time.
1631;I had the benefit of doing a staff ride (field trip) to Normandy during my service in the Big Red One.
1632;The tour was truly invaluable.
1633;the opening scenes of the landing at Normandy are agreed on by most reliable experts to be realistic and the best ever put to film.
1634;He died in action like everyone else and deserves to be remembered only with honor and appreciation.
1635;for a more realistic look at WWII watch Band of Brothers.
1636;These people were truly America's greatest generation and the entire world owes them so much.
1637;Great cast, great performances, great story, and lots of heart.
1638;Tom Hanks is, As always, at his very, impressive best.
1639;vERDICT:A great war movie for any blu.
1640;For those who enjoy the classic films about WWII, this is a 'must have!'
1641;Visual and audio are clear and crisp with smooth streaming.
1642;This has to be the best most genuine war film ever made.
1643;I loved war until I saw this movie.
1644;This film is best viewed in a theater, so the sound is realistic.
1645;If you watch it at home, I hope you have a good surround sound system, because the sound is a VERY important part of the film.
1646;I salute you!This movie should be required viewing by every citizen of the world.
1647;Love all of Tom Hanks movies.
1648;Saving Private Ryan show just an image of what our fighting men did for their country.
1649;This movie gets high marks for the battle scenes alone which are brutally terrifying.
1650;the acting is top notch.
1651;Hanks in particular delivers another oscar.
1652;Otherwise the cast is excellent.
1653;the script is subtle yet powerful.
1654;but certainly the greatest visual explanation of what it meant to be a soldier involved with D. day.
1655;Certainly many viewers will be put off by the overwhelming gore depicted during the first half hour of the film, but this scene, along with the other fire fights, are the essence of Spielberg's masterpiece.
1656;Nonetheless, SPR should be required viewing so that all understand the enormous debt we owe the brave men who fought in Normandy on 6 June 1944.
1657;I really love the story line and character arcs.
1658;Classic film for years to come in my opinion!
1659;First and foremost, This is one of the greatest movies of all time and is definitely in my Top 10.
1660;this is one of the most realistic and horrible movies I've ever seen (and i still haven't seen Schindler's List)So from the get.
1661;something important I need to address
1662;so, historically accurate, emotionally in depth, and one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's gotta be a100%.
1663;Steven Spielberg's brutal yet captivating WWII masterpiece is the combination of poignancy, an amazing story,great performances, incredible detail, and beyond Grade.
1664;a execution, and as a result, it definitively earns its place asone of the greatest movies of all time.
1665;purely brilliant acting, you have to see it to believe it .
1666;one of the best films of ALL TIME.
1667;Tha movie was an educational film with a story that makes you think about the tragedy and triumph of WWII.
1668;Those scenes alone make the movie worth seeing.
1669;The movie does certainly make you truly grateful for the sacrifices made by the veterans.
1670;At one point Speilberg decides give us some comic relief with a scene that involves mistaken identity.
1671;The epiloque is totally unneccessary and is just Spielberg pulling the emotional strings.
1672;To sum up, the movie is worth seeing because it does contain many very good scenes.
1673;I am sure there are many fascinating autobiographies about the period.
1674;Mr. Spielberg is very good at light entertainment, but always seems to go over the top with serious topics.
1675;waving from start to finish, heavy.
1676;handed dialogue, good guys/bad guys plot, and a re.
1677;elder saying something like Tell me I was a good man .
1678;i thought the opening battle scene was powerful but I also found it voyeuristic, as did the kids who crammed the front rows and clearly got off on the gore.
1679;special effects worship, and that's disturbing.
1680;held and on cranes) putting us right in the midst of it all, and quite uncomfortably so.
1681;Malick's film IS a work of art.
1682;It also made me question my beliefs, moved me out of my comfortable preconceptions, and in telling the story implied important questions without providing pat answers.
1683;i cared about the characters in The Thin Red Line precisely because they were so believable .
1684;fallible, hesitant, capable of inexplicable courage and love on the one hand and cynicism and cruelty on the other.
1685;The film (TTRL) is very faithful to the novels by James Jones, who fought in Guadalcanal.
1686;then again, I'm a Canadian, and up here we tend to take ourselves and our mythologies with a healthy grain of salt.
1687;but this was his last truly great effort.
1688;The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material.
1689;It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' clich .
1690;janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high.
1691;speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast.
1692;the film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane.
1693;SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten.
1694;Janusz Kaminsi's photography looks just brilliant, and the sound design has to be heard (preferably at a high volume) to be believed.
1695;and although I had doubts about the earn this final message to Ryan at the end of the film, I believe that the more one watches this excellent film, the more truthful it seems.
1696;Case in point, at the beginning of the film you see a picture of all four Ryan boys in uniform.
1697;Later Private Ryan tells the story of the last time the four of them were together.
1698;And one star for the last two hours.
1699;Until I saw Private Ryan I thought the best film about World War II was John Ford and Robert Montgomery's They were Expendable .
1700;To paraphrase Tom Hanks' last lines, We must make ourselves worthy of their sacrifice.
1701;Despite the advances in filmmaking technology that make Saving Private Ryan a more intense experience than They were Expendable, both are magnificent films that compliment each other.
1702;Spielberg has the advantage of being in an era without the constraints suffered by Ford.
1703;This is an excellent movie I love it.
1704;it is one of my top favorite movies of all time.
1705;This is my favorite movie ever, for a good reason.
1706;(or something like it) and is suddenly amazingly skilled and kills everyone.
1707;The simple moral questions of this movie are intriguing enough
1708;Combine this amazing story with the fantastic war scenes, and you have the best war movie ever (according to the majority of critics.
1709;Something about a fairly historically correct depiction of World War II coming from my generation.
1710;making and history together with a star.
1711;studded cast and engrossing story line.
1712;time favorite in any category.
1713;When I first saw this film, I was impressed with how the landing scene on Normandy captured the extraordinary bravery of those young men who looked death in the face and spit in its eye.
1714;in liberating their own country.
1715;My French is pretty good, but I thought I might have misunderstood him in his opinion about the film.
1716;I was stunned that Spielberg would do such a thing, but I guess he wanted to create some subliminal message in a very moving scene.
1717;This film is without a doubt the best movie ever made about World War II.
1718;Spielberg topped himself with this film, raising the bar for all war films to come.
1719;Tom Hanks and a stellar cast do exceptional work.
1720;Internationally acclaimed by critics and audiences alike, Steven Speilberg's World War II masterpeice, Saving Private Ryan, is an unforgettable film acheivment that has had profound and lasting impact throughout the world.
1721;The Winner of five Acamedy Awards incuding Best Director, the film also captured the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing.
1722;ft. Worth, and Great Britain named the film Best Picture of the Year, while Los Angeles, Toronto, and Boradcast Film Critics honored it with both Best Picture and Best Director Awards.
1723;It is the highest award a civilian can recieve from the Dept. of the Army.
1724;Selected for more than 160 top ten lists, Saving Private Ryan's other awards include Best Picture from the Golden Globes, and the top.
1725;and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor and courage.
1726;my answer is that Saving Private Ryan is the best war film ever.
1727;It is very moving, to the point that WWII veterns broke out into tears in the theaters.
1728;This is a classic filled with great actors and intense battle scenes.
1729;There are no doubts in my mind that Saving Private Ryan is a genuine masterpiece, redefining and refreshing the war movie genre with a harrowing realism that is unmatched by any previous war movie.
1730;Tom Hanks has been so good for so long,we take his great acting skills for granted.
1731;His Captain Miller is wise, tough, compassionate, complex, with his uncontrollable shaking hand, and at times his actions and facial expressions heartbreaking.
1732;Tom Sizemore is a powerhouse as the sergeant, saying we're in business, when there is a chance to make a move through the carnage.
1733;The rest of the squad are excellent and I want to single out Jeremy Davies as the coward and French/German translator.
1734;Spielberg has said that this character is the one most identify with, and if we are in danger really, most of us don't want to fight,kill or be killed.
1735;held cameras just adds to the realism and terror.
1736;The movie transcends its genre with its gut.
1737;Saving Private Ryan is one of the top films of all time regardless of genre.
1738;Effective graphic art draws us in, appealing to the imagination, inviting us to participate in a viewing event.
1739;Whatever the eye of the artist has envisioned,the eye of the beholder brings to practical focus.
1740;The work has to communicate sufficiently for us to relate to it.
1741;The result may taste right to us, but nothingthat actually originated in the sea comes to life in it.
1742;Marine creatures knowthe difference, in a sense that we can only imagine.
1743;Fertile as the prairie, it flows effortlessly into everything he does.
1744;His enthusiasm is positively infectious.
1745;As someone remarksin the retrospective on making Saving Private Ryan that accompanies the D. day edition, Spielberg knows what he wants.
1746;In the broad sense, he has a vision,and a basic plan.
1747;more telling, here, he has a positive mania for detail and storytelling, with a result that these elements sometimes combine, abruptly, forming manic images onthe screen.
1748;Remarkable, what Miller and his sergeant managed to see of the enemy, using their small mirrors, servicing successful battle plans.
1749;A clear hint that we should continue to watch them closely.
1750;Movies, even thoughtfully crafted ones, are products of their time,and this one is no exception.
1751;Steven Spielberg is a master of filmmaking.
1752;But the Allies were successful at taking Normandy, but at the cost of countless lives.
1753;The sequence which details the arrival on the beach to the battle up to Dog Route One is the most harrowing sequence of the horror of war that has ever been committed to film (especially taking into consideration that, according to information I've read, Spielberg actually edited that sequence in camera).
1754;I have no doubt that this is just one example of what those soldiers saw that terrifying day, and there are many more examples throughout the sequence that will be burned into your mind for many many years.
1755;if for no other reason, this sequence is perhaps amongst the best filmmaking that Spielberg has ever done, and why this film is a classic.
1756;what Spielberg did with this film is took a very run.
1757;arms war story and elevated it above the genre.
1758;While I do respect this film immensely, I found that THE THIN RED LINE was a much more effective, profound, and amazingly acted film that, in my opinion, is superior to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with the only exception being that Spielberg, merely from a technical standpoint, is a superior filmmaker.
1759;Yes people, this is the best film EVER made.
1760;Not only did Memorial Day have a new outlook on my life, but the entire military gained a lot more respect from me.
1761;Steven Spielberg brought this to our attention.
1762;The first half hour of this movie is the most intense filming you will ever see on the big screen.
1763;Can you tell I feel this is the best picture ever made???
1764;I can confirm this is a film.
1765;This is one of my favorite movies.
1766;blah blah blah nice hand held camera and action but might as well be a hallmark card sold in a recruiting office.
1767;With its gritty realism, top.
1768;notch acting for, gripping battle scenes and thorough character development, Saving Private Ryan has earned its place as argubly the greatest war movie of all time.
1769;it's easy to make a war movie with a heroic character or two, and these days its easy to make a war movie look good, and good acting isn't terribly hard to attain, but combining all of these characteristics and throwing in a real moral dilemma (not a tacked on sappy conclusion) and brilliant characterization and you've got a great movie.
1770;i failed to mention Spielberg's direction, which is exemplary as usual (why no one likes this guy is beyond me, he's only made Jaws, Indiana Jones, this, Schindler's List and a sleu of wonderful movie), the special effects which are always convincing and often harrowing, the color.
1771;Put everything togethor, and you've got the best war movie of all time.
1772;It is a great movie.
1773;A great cast, well thought out and written movie.
1774;Good for 15 year olds an up
1775;The special features are very good, and the movie superb, but I wish they did a better job on video transfer.
1776;The best movie I have ever seen regarding World War II and D. day in Europe.
1777;This movie is a must for everyone's library.
1778;Everything you could hope for, and THANK GOD it came on a movie that you can rewatch, thanks to Hanks.
1779;Best war movie to show how it really was
1780;A favorite of mine and still get teary eyed when they show the flag at the beginning and end of the movie.
1781;First off I this is the greatest war movie of all time.
1782;world War I is often considering The Great War or The War to End All Wars, but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the American, and the world, consciousness the way that World War II has.
1783;At the end of the 20th century, with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt, Steven Spielberg took another turn at the war film (following 1979's 1941) with Saving Private Ryan.
1784;saving Private Ryan is arguably the greatest war film ever made.
1785;The opening thirty minutes of the D. day invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid.
1786;But it's not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great, it's the character building, the camaraderie between the soldiers, the devotion to duty, and the bravery of these men in combat.
1787;one of the great things about the casting in Saving Private Ryan is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes, and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing.
1788;Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as Capt. John Miller.
1789;Vin Diesel hasn't been this good since, and Barry Pepper as is sensational as religious sniper Pvt. Daniel Jackson.
1790;I don't just recommend this movie, if you haven't seen this you need to watch it, and now that it's out on Blu.
1791;ray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it, or to watch it again.4.5/5
1792;as an American living 50+years after D. day I can see Spielberg's point.
1793;Saving Private Ryan is a call to Americans and those of other freedom.
1794;loving nations to remember and honor, in unmistakably stark and prideful righteousness, just what ghastly price liberty demands.
1795;With A Star Studded Cast, This Film Delievers, In More Ways Than One!
1796;In the last great invasion of the last great war, the greatest danger for eight men.
1797;Internationally acclaimed by critics and audiences alike
1798;Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Director (Steven Spielberg), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing.
1799;texas and Great Britain named it Best Film of the Year, with the Los Angeles, Toronto and Broadcasting Film Critics honored it with Best Picture and Best Director.
1800;In Addition, Steven Spielberg recieved the third Directors Guild of America Award, the American Legion The Spirit of Normandy Award, a USO Merit Award from the USO of Metropolitan Washington, as well as the highest civilian public service award from the Department of the Army.
1801;Selected for more than 160 Top Ten List's, Saving Private Ryan's other honors include Golden Globes for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director, the Producers Guild of America Award and ten nominations from the British Academy Film Awards.
1802;Saving Private Ryan was also the highest grossing picture of 1998.
1803;American Beauty was an absolute delight of a film, but it didnt measure up to the emotional power of Saving Private Ryan.
1804;For one of the best war pictures ever, don't miss Saving Private Ryan, its a life altering experience!
1805;I really enjoyed the realness of the action brought to this movie.
1806;Well, Great performance by Tom Hanks.
1807;Critically acclaimed, Saving Private Ryan has turned out to be one of the most important films, along with Schindler's List in the last century.
1808;Beautifully and realistically filmed, Spielberg does an exquisite job in capturing the horror of World War II.
1809;Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays Captain John Miller, leading his men behind enemy lines in search of Private James Ryan.
1810;With the incredible transfer, sound and theme it is a must own and see by everyone.
1811;A life which it lost its features, value, the actual meaning of our existence on this beatiful earth.
1812;Did gud gave us this earth to destroy it or to live on it, and the Saving of Private Ryan was one decent example for the mankind that taought us that we should love each other and even to sucrify our lives for the love ones.
1813;I feel that this film did convyed the massage that life is still full of good guys , it is only a matter of how good those guys are!
1814;and I feel that was the crack of the matter in this film.
1815;As I am one of loyal admirer and fan of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, I think that this film would never succeeded without them.
1816;Of course with my great admiration to the other casts, directors and whoever participated in the succseed of this great film.
1817;By far still the best War movie out there.
1818;and at some point makes you understand to cherish your life.
1819;I loved the movie, but i had a question about a cast member or two.
1820;In any event, I thank you all very much for your time!
1821;I have never seen any other movie as realistic in graphics as in Saving Private Ryan.
1822;It has a very touching plot to it, also showing us how war was really like at that time.
1823;My favorite character is Jackson, the holy sniper.
1824;He was absolutely one of the tightest characters in the movie.
1825;this is one of my all time favorite movies.
1826;This one is moving, riveting as the pro movie reviewing big wig dorks say, touching, of course exciting because its war.
1827;Tom Hanks does once again blow us away with an amazing protagonist performance.
1828;Even after 14 years this film is amazing.
1829;For $5 I knew this was a steal.
1830;Best war movie ever in my opinion.
1831;Although I give credit where credit is due, and the action scenes in this film go above and beyond to draw the viewer into the heat of battle.
1832;In that element, it succeeds.
1833;The acting in this is also very good.
1834;If Tom Hanks were in My Bosses' Daughter, he'd make it good.
1835;Whoever told Robert Rodat that he's a good writer should be flipping burgers right now.
1836;i got the point of this film after I saw the man with his intestines hanging out and him screaming to the sky for his mother.
1837;It is a brutal opening scene that is very unsettling, incredibly realistic, and masterfully done by Stevey Spielberg.
1838;It's an effective film that's brutally real.
1839;but they explain this quite eloquently in the movie, reading the Lincoln letter: tear.
1840;But in every other way this is a taut, visually stunning film that everyone will acknowledge as in whole or at least in part(s) is the definitive war epic against which all subsequent will be compared.
1841;And why does the old Ryan have bright blue eyes.
1842;Such an honor to the men and women of D. day.
1843;The Commemorative Edition is put together with care and concern for the men and women it honors.
1844;You'll enjoy the read and of course, the viewing for years to come.
1845;You will hand this down to the next generation so they will know and understand a little piece of our past and our future.
1846;As an ode to the sacrifice of American heroes on D. day and beyond, Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.
1847;As a sublime example of the art of ensemble performance, it is superb.
1848;As a depiction of the brutality and confusion of warfare, it is extraordinary, with a number of notable exceptions.
1849;The famous first 20 minutes, depicting the Allied landing at Omaha Beach are Steven Spielberg at his best.
1850;He keeps his men together (in company as well as in spirit), dreaming only of earning his way home with one noble act.
1851;It's a performance worthy of an armful of Oscars.
1852;the making of feature was pretty interesting, showing at length how the incredible beach scenes were shot.
1853;Guys on fire again, but interesting to see what actors put themslves through for a couple seconds of screen time.
1854;It is powerful, emotional, raw, and yes even flawed.
1855;But Saving Private Ryan is a movie.
1856;This is an American film, written by Americans, made by Americans.
1857;In the medium of film exaggeration is often necessary to carry across the full impact of the human experience.
1858;In Saving Private Ryan Spielberg gives to the audience member the sense of how random death is on the battlefield.
1859;It's about conveying to those who have never experience combat .
1860;And even if the movie only brings across a third of that reality then it's a great movie.
1861;One of the best war movies I have ever seen, simply because it isn't from a glorified Hollywood perspective.
1862;This film is as good as or equal to Schindler's List, WATCH IT!
1863;Saving Private Ryan, with its realism, is the greatest war film ever made.
1864;The audio and visual sound effects of both battle scenes make you feel as if you are right beside Cpt.
1865;Excellent Movie, well made with a great story and great actors and actresses.
1866;Great special effects and lots of action!
1867;Tom Hanks turns in perhaps his best performance as the simple yet brave and caring Captain Miller in this World War II epic.
1868;Hanks should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal as Miller.
1869;The first 20 or so minutes of this film should go down in movie history as perhaps the most realistic re.
1870;Although extremely graphic, Spielberg, who did win an Oscar for Best Director, does an unbelieveable job of re.
1871;All history or World War II enthusiasts should view this excellent movie, as it rates with such classics as Patton and The Longest Day.
1872;I have seen Saving Private Ryan once, which is very unusual for me.
1873;If I like a film, I will watch it innumerable times.
1874;Spielberg made this so that people of today can understand what was done for us, and be grateful.
1875;it is not funny, but there are scenes which share the exact screenplay with TLD, but in a completely new light (eg.
1876;the characters in this film are all there for a purpose, and the final touch of inspiration is the fact that you don't know who the veteran is at the beginning .
1877;I have to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.
1878;It was so well put together.
1879;I believe everyone should see it
1880;This flick is great for the first ten minutes, then it sputters out .
1881;the costumes and effects are great throughout, but the action was .
1882;if you want to see great WW2 flicks, there are lots better than this one.
1883;The good guys are still there, and the Nazis are a pretty decent focal point of evil.
1884;Ryan is thus an old fashion film with new story telling techniques attached to it in order to give the film a more visceral impact on the audience.
1885;Yet, it seems to owe a little bit to Spielberg's past works of cinema, such as E. t. and, what I think is his best film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
1886;When it all comes down to it, Mr. Spielberg is a very talented American director.
1887;which means that his ability to tell a story is based on the entertainment value of the subject.
1888;The best war movie ever.
1889;I've seen it like 18 times and it never gets old.
1890;The whole cast are vVERY GREAT acters and it is a must see
1891;This movie is great, ensnaring with its recreation of the normandy invasion's, right until the captivating bridge battle.
1892;After you see it the first time you'll still want to see it again.
1893;This is an excellent movie that shows it like it really is, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to try to understand what the people in their families or maybe even their spouses have went through.
1894;If you are looking for a real , heart wrenching story.
1895;This is a great movie, and well worth the price.
1896;I loved the film, the realism of scenes are very good and above all its plot, matches are very real, and the production is excellent, took into account all those small sizes, which in the end made a big production, excellent film, I recommend it, people who likes action films
1897;the packaging of this set is one the best I have ever seen for any movie.
1898;the menu sequences are brilliantly dynamic, and there is a ton of special feature you will enjoy
1899;one of the best war time movies ever made.
1900;one of Tom Hanks, best works.
1901;something to watch maby once a year.
1902;The story begins with the D. day Invasion at Omaha beach.
1903;Capt John Miller (Tom Hanks) along with Sgt. Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore) lead a squad of Rangers onto the beach of Omaha at Normandy.
1904;The next 20.25 mintues are the most intense and realistic I have ever seen.
1905;Each platoon or squad in the military is like this, some nice men, others not!
1906;Men that had landed with Miller are the backbone of the film.
1907;Pvt. Reiben (Ed Burns) who likes black humor and has a quick temper, Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel) a large well hearted man.
1908;Many viewers have to look twice to realize that this is Diesel in an early role.
1909;His acting abilites are strongest in this film.
1910;His job is simple yet could be anything but.
1911;Capt. Miller who has kept the squad together the best he can runs into a road block, stay and help defend the bridge or take Pvt. Ryan against his will and go.
1912;It takes your breath away and won't let you go.
1913;It makes you appricitate freedom.
1914;People around the world need to understand that this is a film about Americans in WWII.
1915;Were not saying we won the war ourself.
1916;Used to keep the movie going, thats it.
1917;Best Director Spielberg, also won for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects editing.
1918;Best film and most important one I have ever seen.
1919;The US and British troops had an incredible numerical superiority.
1920;in terms of spectacle and entertainment , I give the movie an A.
1921;Saving Private Ryan is the definitive film regarding Operation Overlord.
1922;This film is so effective, because it forces the audience to abdon their innocence just like those young men who fought in the Second World War did repectively.
1923;the best performance of the movie is that of Matt Damon as Private Ryan.
1924;eyed young man who is thrust into a fight for his life and for freedom.
1925;Anyway, this movie along with The Thin Red Line are the best contemporary films on the Second World War, and I would recommend either to anyone wanting to be sobered by the true, unromanticized nature of war.
1926;Probably the best American war movie.
1927;It will be a classic, played on network TV for years to come.
1928;Spielberg and Hanks delivered a real treat.
1929;The movie speaks to those who have served unlike any other movie.
1930;Hanks' performance also shows how free soldiers face into the terror and Charlie Mike (continue mission).
1931;this is a move everyone should see.
1932;greatest war movie probably ever made!
1933;, lots of action compelling story loaded with extras.
1934;The most intense depiction of the Hell of war that I have ever seen.
1935;It runs the gamut of emotions, and takes you to the core of humanity.
1936;Great great great great wonderful
1937;this was one of his best and a favorite of mine.
1938;SPR is the greatest war movie ever.
1939;The battles are amazing, like none ever put on film, and the drama reaches beyond the other war films and tips your eye, causing them to leak with one half happiness and one half sadness.
1940;Hanks' death helps separate this from most war films, and all performances are good, especially the newcomers.
1941;See it tonight, remember it forever.
1942;Quite simply the greatest war film ever.
1943;wrenching opening scenes but the last fight as well.
1944;The part where the German soldier slowly sinks his knife into and American while the American is asking what he's saying is so unique and horrifying that it is unlikely to ever be replicated.
1945;Saving PRivate Ryan was an excellent movie based on WWII.
1946;The movie itself had an excellent plot, which was finding private Ryan, (Matt Damon) telling him he was the only brother alive out of the other three.
1947;tom Hanks also did a magnificent job in playng the captain.
1948;All these actors played very great roles.
1949;the acting was also very well done.
1950;I returned it and received a copy that works correctly, meaning it pauses briefly during the layer transition.
1951;The slaughter is horrendous and the ocean beach is red with blood.
1952;this is an excellent movie and it brings the horrors of war to the front of your mind.
1953;It is a good story based in the most horrific background of a deadly war.
1954;This movie is one of the most intense movies I have ever watched and its realism is what makes the story so powerful.
1955;i recommend this movie to you as a first class movie and it should be in your collection.
1956;Tom Hanks in this Military WWII Historic Drama is spectacular.
1957;The sound is great, and I found myself lost amidst the big battles and gunfights.
1958;It's very riveting, you will be too busy being angry and sad with the people in the movie to nitpick about some inconsistencies.
1959;Great movie, I only wish the ending.
1960;There are better things to concentrate on .
1961;Thanks for letting me vent.
1962;SPR went the rest of the way taking that to it's next stage and adding even greater levels of detail and historical accuracy and realism .
1963;it was the movie that led to a whole new generation of movies in the last decade (Band of Brothers
1964;The movie speaks for itself as a classic.
1965;It's a good addition to any movie collection.
1966;A wonderful transfer of a first.
1967;The interactive menus are phenomenal, offering real.
1968;Definately much more interesting than the standard title blurb.
1969;The transfer is cutting edge, fully re.
1970;tom Hanks should have won the best actor oscar for his role.
1971;He was calm and quiet but also very believable as an English teacher there to do a job.
1972;One of Tom Hanks best roles.
1973;It is another of my favorite movies.
1974;So well done, great cast.
1975;A video of this movie ,or others , should be shown in wide screen format , and life will be wonderful again.
1976;Right away on the opening action scene where the soldiers land on Omaha Beach, the audio stands out and is crisp, clear and amazingly active.
1977;Bullets whiz by with a sound that is sweet until you see and hear them hitting bodies, grenades and land.
1978;Saving Private Ryan is filled with non.
1979;Excellent throughout the entire movie.
1980;I genuinely feel they did an excellent job on this movie.
1981;This movie should be required viewing for any American who has never served in the military.
1982;Brutal, horrifying, and in your face real.
1983;The most impressive aspect of this film was Mr. Spielberg's attention to detail and penchant for realism.
1984;One of the best war films I have ever watched, both in realism and connection with the characters.
1985;The movie holds attention througout as you feel part of what is happening.
1986;Tought to watch as a veteran, yet appreaciated.
1987;To see what our Grandfathers had to go threw so we can all have the freedom we enjoy today.
1988;notch surround sound system and prepare for an amazingly stressful ride!
1989;After the first 20 minutes (D. day), I was shaking with adrenaline and induced stress!
1990;class movies like this one.
1991;The research, sets, acting (Tom Hanks especially), special effects and audio tracks are about as good as it gets.
1992;Saving Private Ryan is a great movie.
1993;But most of it is during the first half hour when it shows D. day.
1994;If you want a happy movie about barney or something dont watch this.
1995;This is a impressive movie but the case didn't last very long .
1996;But I'm still glad I bought it!
1997;This stunning movie asks the one question that every American should ask of themselves.
1998;I found Saving Private Ryan to be a lot less enjoyable than I hoped it would be.
1999;It was, of course, extremely impressive in its scope, remarkable in terms of its humanity and most stunning in visual and audio effects.
2000;I really enjoy dialogue and the interaction of characters and while some of the key roles in the movie had interesting things to say, they always managed to say it in a way that made me less interested than I should have been.
2001;minute battle sequence that many claim is the most realistic ever committed to celluloid.
2002;But the film's true achievement, apart from its Oscar.
2003;winning editing and visual effects, is its charged storyline and debate over the merits of bloodshed.
2004;rate cast including Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, and Giovanni Ribisi, Ryan honors the sacrifice of soldiers while acknowledging that war truly is hell.
2005;Still pretty in terms of the scenes.
2006;This is, without a doubt, my favorite Spielberg film.
2007;This film manages to paint a very vivid world out of the most tattered Europe brought to film.
2008;On top of that, it manages to send so many powerful messages about mankind and war.
2009;On top of that, it brings forth the best performances I've seen out of every single actor in it.
2010;On top of THAT, it manages to entertain the hell out of you.
2011;moments can be tough to stomach.
2012;This is realistic battle, and you feel every single bullet wound, punch, defeat, and victory.
2013;And yet, you will want to watch it again, and again.
2014;most say that Schindler's List was Spielberg's masterpiece.
2015;I certainly agree that it was massively important, and a work of art.
2016;The first 30 minutes are far and away the best combat scenes ever filmed in peace time.
2017;Savagery, chaos and incomparable courage.
2018;The film certainly makes a statement just not necessarily the strongest statement.
2019;This film is indisputably classic.
2020;He got lucky to be unspotted.
2021;Final small unit action at Ramelle.
2022;my second guarantee is you're confident of crushing a cut.
2023;again, this film is an absolute classic.
2024;ps, If anyone knows what the SS soldier says to Mellish as he knifes him through the heart, please comment, and thanks.
2025;it is a masterpiece of films, technical advisors were actual soldiers that took part in that event in the 1940's and survived it, that is why all was done realistically and it wasn't a Hollywood Special Effects contest from scene to scene or over any films to that date, it was as it was in the days of the war, nothing more and nothing less.
2026;The documentary style cinematography, the absence of hollywood.
2027;style bravado, and the graphic content of this film make for a chilling experience that makes for many redundancies in the reviews.
2028;It is an awesome movie and deserves all the credit it receives.
2029;The sheer emotional power of this film makes it one of the greatest tributes ever to the soldiers who fought and often died to make our world what it is today.
2030;Saving Private Ryan is on many levels an outstanding film.
2031;from the excellent performances of a star.
2032;level cast to the brilliant special effects to the cinematic capture of the essence of the horrors of war.
2033;Even the hardest viewer likely will shed a tear at the horror of combat or the bravery and valor of the soldiers called to fight.
2034;So should it be required of anyone who has disparaged the honor of our armed forces, for even those reluctant to fight deserve our utmost respect when called to do so, and this film offers renewed appreciation of those soldiers who have defended our freedom through time.
2035;it is simply that good.
2036;This may well be one of the best.
2037;it's a very brief moment in an otherwise excellent movie, but that it is the final image taints the experience of the whole movie.
2038;it is, after all, the final impression we are left with.
2039;this movie contains some of the most graphic, brutally honest battle scenes ever filmed, I think.
2040;Young men (and women) should watch this before enlisting!
2041;this is Spielberg's best work since Jaws (which, in my opinion, is still his best movie).
2042;This was an excellent movie by far.
2043;I know this for a fact because i experienced something a lot similar as did are great heros of WWII.
2044;I recommened that everyone should see this movie.
2045;It will give you a better idea of what we america servivemen go through in combat.
2046;Saving Private Ryan is a great film.
2047;The war scenes are spectacularly choreographed.
2048;It'll make you feel like you are in Normandy during World War II.
2049;The directing is top notch.
2050;Stephen Speilberg richly deserved the Directing Oscar that he received for this film.
2051;The real stars of this film are the sound, cinematography and editing.
2052;Out of all of the films that I have seen that were made in the 90's, this has to be best of those three.
2053;The camera work is awesome.
2054;like which enhanced the feel of the movie.
2055;And last, but not least, the editing is magnificent.
2056;with Saving Private Ryan, director Spielberg sets out to take the depiction of the horrors of war to new heights.
2057;It is also, by repute, the most accurate depiction of the landings ever on the screen.
2058;the explicit violence and special effects are wrapped around a plot that would have done John Wayne proud in the pre Vietnam era.
2059;The cast are competent and the script is slick but the film really stands on its special effects, action and pace.
2060;These are all spot on, it was these aspects of the film that won Oscars and they combine to produce a film that is well worth watching.
2061;Tom Hanks does a fine job (as usual).
2062;This is a movie you would like to see if you enjoy things about the war.
2063;Stephen Speilberd(director) did a realisic great war movie!It has great actors including Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Tom sizemore.
2064;this is a movie to see!
2065;Saving Private Ryan is by far the best war film ever made.
2066;ray version is incredible and rings out a lot of unseen detail.
2067;how much you want to bet that Spielberg gets a wild hair up his posterior soon and decides to re.
2068;It was very realistic for once
2069;This is much better than the Thin Red Line (also a decent movie) and it is by far the most realistic portrayal of war ever put on film.
2070;Spielberg puts you right in the action with the soldiers.
2071;it features a stellar cast and awe.
2072;inspiring lead performances by Hanks and Damon.
2073;Spielberg's overarching message in Saving Private Ryan is that after 54 years, the Allied myths about World War Two continue to hold true.
2074;There are good wars, by golly, and WWII was it.
2075;one of the most compelling principals in the film is the Sgt. York character.
2076;how the Germans ever conquered Europe and North Africa and fought the Red Army to the gates of Moscow is certainly a mystery if one credits their portrayal in Saving Private Ryan.
2077;as soon as they are in American sights they get hit and drop, whereas American troops can run in front of a legion of Wehrmacht rifles and machine guns while dodging bullets with miraculous invulnerability.
2078;The best part of this movie is the realistic battle scenes.
2079;There are two of them lasting nearly a half hour each.
2080;The gritty fighting scenes (and, yes the gore and suffering depicted) do homage to the brave US soldiers who fought at D. day and beyond.
2081;It's a terrifying vision of battle that thrusts the viewer right into the heart of combat and shows you what bullets do to a person.
2082;He succeeds but we never learn as much about them as we really should.
2083;Hanks' Miller is a fully developed character that will appeal to all but the others seem like shadows.
2084;a lot of critics have pointed at the rather polarised view of the war that SPR takes and they do have a point.
2085;For such a self claimed 'Honest' portrayal it's very choosy about which truths it tells you.
2086;But if the characters are stereotypes they're well written, well acted stereotypes and when Spielberg does get around to showing the frailties of his troops he does so with tremendous pathos.
2087;sPR is better as a reminder of who we owe our freedom to rather than a gripping cinematic vision.
2088;Das Boot, a GERMAN war film, holds that crown and will continue to do so for a very long.
2089;This movie is definetely one my favorite movies.
2090;Along with Black Hawk Down it has a storyline unlike other war movies.
2091;This movie should go down into history and honor the veterans.
2092;The movie has an incredible cast, Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg,Giovanni Ribisi, and Vin Diesel.
2093;They give a mememorable performance.
2094;theres plenty of action and realism in the film the story may be fictional but its done in a way that you would actually think its a true story.
2095;This is my favorite war movie of all time.
2096;This movie reaches out and touches you.
2097;It touches your heart and soul to see these men risk their lives in the name of honor and all things that are good.
2098;It's inspiring and brings out the patriot in anyone.
2099;This movie is pretty deep.
2100;time realistic as this one.
2101;After watching that movie on Memorial Day, I had a whole new level of respect of those who served and who are serving in the US military, especially the ones who didn't make it back.
2102;In other words, I totally recommend it to anyone who won't panic (or anything worse) at the sight of a soldier slowlying dying as he looks at his intestines sprawled out on the beach next him.
2103;if you can take it, watch this movie!
2104;The story line, characters, EVERYTHING in this movie is amazing.
2105;Totally recommend it and that is why I give it five stars.
2106;The story line is good, the action is realistic .
2107;the D. day scene will awe you with respect for those who actually faced those bloody beaches.
2108;What a generation, the greatest generation who really saved a great deal of the world from absolute tyrany.
2109;It's a great movie, I think american people will enjoy a lot.
2110;love this movie from day one.
2111;Ive seen it multiple times and it always draws your entire attention.
2112;its a great father and son movie
2113;I'm an American and proud that we fought in that war, but also greatly saddened by the loss of american lives in the war.
2114;But I'm not proud that Spielberg is an American.
2115;An American flag at the beginning and an American flag at the end is the dumbest form of patriotism I have ever seen.
2116;This film captivated me and millions of others.
2117;A great story, dialogue, action, and accuracy make this one of the best movies ever.
2118;This is a pretty good movie from the production standpoint.
2119;The scenes are vivid, bloody, gory, disgusting, and in some parts surreal .
2120;While I thankfully will probably never know what D. day was like, this film gets us closer to knowing how it was than without it.
2121;That way, we think twice about engaging in it.
2122;Politics aside, that certainly has special meaning today.
2123;There are lots of additional points about the reality of day.
2124;responsible for this is the historical consultant, historian Ambrose.
2125;This movie is amazing and it is my favorite.
2126;I'm fascinated and so interested in WW2!
2127;Thank you amazon for supplying my favorite movies.
2128;trhis movie ie highly recommended by me .
2129;This movie stole my heart!
2130;It is a remarkable film.
2131;There are not that many great war movies but this one could be one of the best.
2132;The way Steven Speilberg captures the emotion and realism of WWII was just extrordinary.
2133;saving Private Ryan is one of the closest war movies I've ever seen to capture the reality of war and the pain that it causes to families and their loved ones.
2134;SPOILERS ALERT:Okay, great action movie.
2135;Reiben derides this as the decent thing to do.
2136;Both Upham and Miller are a bit nerdy, well educated, and quasi.
2137;So De Palma seems to disagree with Speilberg and Ryan scriptwriter, Robert Rodat, on this point, though i do know Spielberg and De Palma are great friends).
2138;Very realistic style war movie.
2139;It is a big adventure.
2140;This truly one of the best films I have ever seen.
2141;The amount of drama in this movie and the feelings spilberg is able to bring out is amazing.
2142;This void is a accurate depiction of the D. day invasion in a commercial motion picture.
2143;The Longest Day is excellent.
2144;Saving Private Ryan is excellent.
2145;Both movies should be viewed to understand D. day.
2146;Saving Private Ryan adds to actual participants, the more than able assistance of historian Stephen Ambrose to add accuracy to the film.
2147;This is an important film both historically and socially.
2148;and that is saying alot in consideration of many memorable and excellent films that have been produced in this genre.
2149;but unlike some other producers that are interested in putting some sort of liberalized softball flick out there, Spielberg is a genius.
2150;He gives it to you exactly as it was and as it should be portrayed.
2151;These are the Americans that Tom Brokaw outlined in his excellent book, The Greatest Generation.
2152;this is an American film made by a patriotic and very American director about American soldiers.
2153;The sane people will enjoy the poignant and memorable movie, perhaps Spielbergs best!
2154;The film blew me away when I saw it on a Saturday afternoon with my wife.
2155;Their stories and my own brief encounters with combat conditions confirm the basic realism of the scenes Spielberg shot.
2156;The brave implication is this: there is a kind of better comprehension in looking.
2157;This film not only captures the horror of war, but skillfully depicts individual attitudes and mental states of human beings involved in war.
2158;This movie is superior even when judged out of its likely assigned genre of  war movie.
2159;There's more, but I will jump ahead to the bridge battle.
2160;Don't get me wrong I love this movie and have a copy of it to show I do, but come on now!
2161;If Steven needs a Continuity director to help him with scene and equipment specifications from cut to cut or scene to scene I will be more than happy to lend a helping hand.
2162;although I never served in the armed forces or experienced combat, I hold the utmost respect and honor for the men and women who fought and paid the price for my freedom.
2163;in a film filled with haunting and searing images, one particular stands out.
2164;Spielberg allows us to rediscover that these pillars of marble were once breathing young men filled with hopes, aspirations, talents, flaws and fears.
2165;behind the veteran stand his children and grandchildren.
2166;His life is their (and our) legacy.
2167;Spielberg's purpose then as a film maker becomes clear.
2168;He will attempt to show the lives of the men now laying beneath the ground.
2169;like all good art, and this film is a very fine example, Saving Private Ryan evolves into something other than mere entertainment.
2170;It grabs the viewer by the heart and refuses to let go.
2171;It forces one to feel, contemplate, experience and remember.
2172;As it unfolds on the screen, the story becomes not only a cultural event but also a lesson in the grand extremes of human character.
2173;Spielberg shows us the best and the worst man has to offer.
2174;That description well serves the actions of Captain Miller and his men as well as those of PVT. James Ryan.
2175;They place their job and their ultimate task (winning the war) as their goal.
2176;Many times in the film they are faced with choices that could easily allow them escape, and almost always they defer to the bigger picture.
2177;spielberg shows maturity as a filmmaker by muting John Williams' score.
2178;unlike the cartoonish Lethal Weapon series, the slick James Bond films, the muscle.
2179;Quite often, violence in films is used as a vehicle to stimulate the adrenaline glands enough to make an audience cheer and applaud.
2180;because of the battle scenes, Spielberg himself has forbidden his children from watching it.
2181;the American every man cast is centered around the near perfect performance of Tom Hanks.
2182;It certainly is the best film of the year as well as one of the finest films ever made.
2183;It is a film to be remembered and celebrated.
2184;This film proves it isn't the format that counts, it's the remembrance and respect.
2185;He acts as if he does, and the result is disastrous.
2186;The script is hilariously bad, the actors can't act, and the result is a movie that is visually appealing to the uninformed.
2187;the people Spielberg likes to manipulate.
2188;It's is full of American flag.
2189;other than that, the movie is one of the goriest I have ever seen.
2190;It is one thing to make a war movie and another to make a movie that captures the hearts of everyone who happens to catch a glimpse of any scene in any part of the movie.
2191;This movie is amazing in every way.
2192;This movie shows a great deal about how soldiers were affected during the war.
2193;This is an excellent war movie that shows an appreciation for our service men and the loss experiences of family members.
2194;This movie has scenes that you can relate to, like the sweet D. day scene.
2195;With great acting and directing this is definitely a keeper.
2196;One of the best WW2 movies, Saving Private Ryan on Blu.
2197;ray looks better than ever.
2198;Sound and image are wonderfull.
2199;Yes, it has excellent special effects and I admit it set a new standard for Hollywood when it comes to combat cinematography .
2200;Great movies require good plots, great writing, and believable characters and situation.
2201;The film The Longest Day did a much better job of creating the illusion of expansion of time despite being made nearly 60 years before this film.
2202;chance that they might come across one man in particular.
2203;clearly a superior officer who would NOT be taking any guff from a private .
2204;Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS.
2205;The pin fits up the center of the base of the mortar round .
2206;if you just want to watch a movie to be shocked and awed by eye candy, I can see this film being entertaining.
2207;Those who enjoy this film will probably enjoy U.571 as well.
2208;One of the best movies ever made, and perhaps THE best war movie ever made.
2209;the fact that these soldiers were largely a bunch of average guys (like my Dad) who went out and defeated the Nazis because somebody had to is simply remarkable.
2210;Their courage and sacrifice quite literally saved the world.
2211;This was great movie, great display of what happend on D. day and next few days after.
2212;This movie is probably the best representation of WWII ever produced, and is most definitely worth its 5 Academy Awards.
2213;Tom Hanks delivers a gripping performance that will have you on the edge of your seat.
2214;This movie is a great movie to show teenagers what war is like.
2215;line fits right into it.
2216;The character development is great.
2217;The F/X are the best I have seen in all my life.
2218;If you want a great war movie to show you what war was like, I strongly suggest this masterpiece of Speilberg's adding to his hundreds of other masterpieces.
2219;I watched the first scence of D. day and I have to tell you I was inpressed.
2220;I love this movie and when tell people that they seem to think that all I like it for is the blood and gore.
2221;Another reason that I love this movie is because it really shows how hard war is on people and soldiers especially.
2222;Bottom line this movie is great.
2223;Funny however, is the fact that I have heard no World War II veterans or even war veterans in general complain about this film's realism, that is because this film does an excellent job of depicting what war was like for the average soldier.
2224;The story was good too and touched me so much that I thanked a Korean vet for his service to our country.
2225;This is an excellent movie and instead complaining about its inadequaces people should go to their local veterans center and thank those men who reside there for their willingness to die so that we may be free.
2226;This is a fine WWII movie that shows the bravery of American soldiers in the face of so much horror, chaos, and hardship of war.
2227;This film is about showing respect to those who risk their lives in order to make this a better and more peaceful world.
2228;This movie doesn't pull any punches and it is better for it.
2229;The DTS version literally recreates the movie theater experience (with the right equipment).
2230;I was able to watch the movie yet again as if it were for the first time because the auditory experience was so intense.
2231;Everyone kept saying how this film did not glorify war, and shows how gritty and unpleasent it truly was, which I thought might be a nice change from pearl harbor.
2232;I picked up the Sapphire BR SPR a month ago and finally got around to watching and hearing it.
2233;greens, browns, greys, blacks and yes red.
2234;It's going to make you say.
2235;wow in the sense like seeing Monsters,Inc or Avatar.
2236;The first 20.25 minutes of the movie is a must for audio fans.
2237;In Saving Private Ryan you see and feel it and it hits you squarely between the eyes.
2238;At the last minute everyone is saved by a pair of P.51's along with reinforcements.
2239;As the film returns as it did in the beginning the older Ryan asks his wife has he led a good life and been a good man while standing in front of Capt. Millers tombstone.
2240;What can I say, other than what a great movie!
2241;Got moved by the fact a mother lost three sons and the fourth and last is about to be saved.
2242;gives you a punch in the tummy and you'll feel it for a long time.
2243;I had heard from soldiers and WWII experts that the opening scenes of this movie were truly authentic and tells of the D. day landing as it really was.
2244;I had resisted seeing this film since I thought it might be a 'feel good' flic, but it was actually very well done.
2245;Tom Hanks did a great job and it was, all told, riveting.
2246;Steven Spielberg loves WWII, he is really fascinated with it.
2247;Saving Private Ryan is the true story of a group of men risking their lives for one.
2248;Spielberg even mentions this in the making of.
2249;What this movie has done really well are the editing and the camera work.
2250;When combined we have a very genuine feel to the movie and not something churned out by Hollywood such as Windtalkers.
2251;War is a very unique in that soldiers go into it wanting to fire big guns but in the midst of it they realize more about themselves then ever before, and this movie demonstrates that very well.
2252;The opening D. day scene is intense and probably one of the best edited scenes of all time.
2253;The picture is very sharp and very clear as it should be.
2254;Excellent sound for a movie that won one of its Oscars for sound.
2255;pACKAGING / EXTRAS: I love the packaging of this set.
2256;There is no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is one of my most favorite movies ever, if not the favorite.
2257;It's a great story set in the European theatre of WWII.
2258;This is just one heck of a film, and you're guaranteed to remember it if you see it.
2259;American military service at its finest, folks.
2260;My motto is, if a movie can make you cry, you know its really good.
2261;The first time I saw this, it made me tear.
2262;That's the honest to God truth.
2263;Saving Private Ryan, although shown mainly from the americans perspective, does not glamorize war, yet still manages to come through as one of the greatest war movies of all time.
2264;But overall, it is an excellently directed and produced war film with good character depth and a great plot.
2265;The greatest war film ever created.
2266;It begins with the D. day battle of Omarha beach.
2267;This is a brilliant opening scene which lasts for around half an hour.
2268;The Americans are all in boats and have to make their way up a beach which is protected by a German machine gun.
2269;just trust me, I have it on video and it is amazing .
2270;The performances and the directing and producing are first rate.
2271;This movie should have won an Oscar for every catagory that it was nominated for.
2272;I will make one caveat: if you have a tender heart, please don't see this movie.
2273;I will never forgive the academy for choosing 'Shakespeare in Love' over 'Saving Private Ryan' for best picture.
2274;So please consider their opinion ahead of mine.
2275;This is no glamour war film, it's gritty, violent, uplifting, disgusting, heroic, and emotionally draining.
2276;This is a must see epic.
2277;While SPR has some great action sequences that's about all there is.
2278;Still, you have to give Speilberg credit for filming some of the best action sequences of all time.
2279;This is really a great war movie!
2280;This is an incredible movie and very moving.
2281;It was a gift for my father and he really enjoyed the movie
2282;Saving Private Ryan brings the war home to you like few films do.
2283;It doesn't seem to be in Spielberg's DNA to produce a clunker (We don't discuss 1941 in polite company) and he has delivered another winner.
2284;Tom Hanks is, as always, completely believable in whatever role he takes on and he is in this one too.
2285;This little Band of Brothers become your band of brothers and you hope they succeed in their quest with all your heart.
2286;Some people criticized the film's beginning as overly sentimental and I see their point but the film as a whole is breathtaking.
2287;Watch for the proof of this statement.
2288;rated and how it was hyped up more than it deserved.
2289;a 'masterpiece' and would undoubtedly set a standard that other war movies have to match!
2290;He relived his experience again!
2291;That takes skill and vision!!
2292;All in all, it gave us an extremely realistic look at WW2.
2293;Otherwise the film held together very well!!
2294;I remember hearing about this one on the radio.
2295;One minute you're seeing an old man reminiscing, next minute you're on Omaha Beach.
2296;Especially with the jittery motion and the bits of breathing that you hear in the background.
2297;A great movie that gives a real depiction of Doomsday and doesn't hold back.
2298;A great piece of history.
2299;A great story told about the Sole Survivor Rule of the military, that allows the last of a generation to be protected.
2300;Very powerful characters that shows some of the struggles that our troops encounter.
2301;A pure act of compassion, bravery, discipline, leadership, morality, and love.
2302;i can't start to say how incredible this movie is!
2303;It is sad, surreal, graphic, stunning, and thought.
2304;Tom Hanks does an outstanding job and so does everybody else!
2305;It vividly shows both through the brilliant cinematograhy and the equally briliant acting the brutality of war and the great price paid by many both directly and indirectly involved.
2306;hanks is at his best in this movie and gives a tradesmanlike performance which we have become accustomed to seeing from this actor.
2307;Sizemore gives us another look at his considerable talent and is a good foil to Hanks throughout the film.
2308;I personally feel it is the directing that this film will chiefly be remembered for and the powerful message it conveys rather than the acting which is not to downplay the acting in any way.
2309;I doubt we will see better from Spielberg although this directors ability to surprise is well documented.
2310;The movie captures this aspect brilliantly.
2311;There are not sufficient superlatives to accord this masterpiece.
2312;One of the best American films of the past few years (the embarassment of the film community when the puerile Shakespeare in Love won best picture last year was palpable) this movie reminds us all that a hero is simply an ordinary person in an extradinary situation.
2313;so much has been said about this great movie that I won't go into much more detail, except to point out that the previous reviewer makes a couple of mistakes.
2314;the ones who go on the patrol with him are simply some of the survivors.
2315;the acting and personal identities, personalities of the people protrayed was fantastic.
2316;I like for the older kids to watch the film to understand the sacrifices of our fighting men and Woman.
2317;what a tribute to America's liberation of Europe.
2318;God Bless America and the people ( and their families ) that serve the noble cause of world freedom!
2319;I've read hundreds of movie reviews over the years, but I just read the best of the best: Doug Thomas' short, direct essay on Saving Private Ryan.
2320;Knowing about the director's first home movie reveals to me something of the director as a human being.
2321;Because of this, I feel Saving Private Ryan, as a cinematic work of art, is in a class by itself.
2322;I finally found the right place to say it.
2323;i trust the Amazon products, very genuine and good at Customer Care!Regards,Keshava RajuBangalore, INDIA.
2324;The action and drama are off the scale in this incredible movie.
2325;It has a great cast, great special effects, a touching story, and great cinematography.
2326;True, there are elements that Spielburg didn't replicate exactly, but the film still one of the greatest ever made.
2327;What was replicated perfectly were the important elements of heroism, sacrifice, compassion, and the enduring human spirit.
2328;I think that Steven Spielburg succeeded.
2329;This movie really gives you a sense of what WWII was like.
2330;The opening scene was brilliant, same as the shell shock scene at the end.
2331;The conversation between the captain and the sergeant while the rest of their squad is sleeping inside is really great.
2332;I felt as if what they were talking about was the most important thing in the world, and i was hooked on every word.
2333;The movie does show the usual Spielberg technical prowess that is evident in the superb battle scenes, especially a stunning re.
2334;of featurette that mentions a real.
2335;The featurette also shows wonderful, rarely.
2336;Saving Private Ryan is Director Steven Spielberg's acclaimed movie about finding the last surviving brother (one of four) who was part of the Normandy invasion of World War II.
2337;Steeped in sentimentallty as Spielberg movies often are, you do feel a genuine sympathy for the characters.
2338;as the designated mission accomplishes its goal at great cost.
2339;notable for its intensely graphic 20.
2340;The movie boasts an impressive cast including Tom Hanks as the captain leading Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, and Vin Diesel, among others, to find Matt Damon.
2341;Also included are cast/crew detail and a couple trailers.
2342;numbing violence, and realistic disorientation, earns the film the credit I have given it.
2343;dimensionally) inspirational, based solely on that single theme.
2344;The Thin Red Line, a somewhat flawed but better film, gives one much more philosophical meat to chew on.
2345;In short, it looks a lot more impressive when first viewed than when repeatedly examined.
2346;this is an amazing film.
2347;I haven't seen half of the films Spielberg has directed, so I must have something to look forward to.
2348;I did watch his first film, Duel, on TV as a young adult, probably in it's debut.
2349;Perhaps that simple film, Duel, Was just about the action on screen.
2350;It was a good film.
2351;At least I, and a teenage buddy who was also watching the film, at his house, both liked the movie.
2352;a friend claims if you ever want a book made into a movie, Steven Spielberg will tell the exact tale written on paper.
2353;Perhaps capturing the spirit as well.
2354;He did a wonderful tribute to Stanley Kubrick in Artificial Intelligence.
2355;I wonder if we see more of Spielberg here in Saving Private Ryan?The most memorable scene to me is when an American GI is about to be stabbed to death by a German soldier.
2356;The killing is done for the day, and perhaps, hopefully, done.
2357;The story captures your heart as they, Capt. Miller and his men, journey through a difficult struggle to save one man, Prvate Ryan.
2358;As they travel through a German occupied area you reach out and feel the character of each individual person.
2359;You see just a small taste of D. day right at the beginning and then things carry out the dramatization.
2360;Spielberg has created a masterpierce that should be commended in years to come, it's heartfelt and true for what it really is.
2361;I love the film, it truly is inspiring.
2362;Tom Hans does a superb job in this movie!
2363;propagandistic American take on World War Two.
2364;I actually found the combat depicted to be closer to what it must have been like than you find in most war movies.
2365;Vets have said that this is the most accurate portrayal of what it was like on Omaha Beach on D. day.
2366;Thank God we had people willing to survive that!
2367;Spielberg does a phenomenal job of capturing emotional depth.
2368;The battle scenes, the actors, and the story are all so captivating.
2369;One of the best movies I have seen, hands down.
2370;The movie was very good!
2371;Good story plot, props, and cinema and production!
2372;The movie reflected the hardship that the USA military ensured during WWII when brothers went to war and potentially served in the same organization, risking their lives.
2373;Watch this movie, and imagine yourself in a soldier's shoe.
2374;Afterward, you'll have a greater respect for the generation that won WWII.
2375;Saving Private Ryan is, of course, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks first tribute to the gallant men who fought in the war to end all wars.
2376;While this exceptional film is not based solely on the actual actions of one unit like their later masterpiece, Band of Brothers', it is clearly the most realistic World War II silver screen blockbuster to date!
2377;This film, from the very beginning draws you into the world of these valiant soldiers as they are in the landing craft preparing for the gate to drop and hit the beach.
2378;No film prior to this has ever more realistically and poignantly showed the true costs of war, without glorifying those costs.
2379;A major portion of his company is wiped out during the invasion on Omaha beach and a follow on action in which they had to take out a pair of German 88's.
2380;special Features:An exclusive message from Steven Spielberg .
2381;which gives Academy Award winning Best Director an opportunity to display his admiration for America's Greatest Generation.
2382;which is a wonderful tribute to the men who fought the war and, in part, to those who brought this film to the silver screen.
2383;It's one of the most realistic movie of war, that i've ever seen.
2384;Strangely, Ryan still won every other Best Picture trophy to be given that year.
2385;(Kind of reminds me how Michelle Pffeiffer won almost every Best Actress award for Fabulous Baker Boys except the Oscar.)
2386;It is one of the most realistic depictions of combat in movie history.
2387;ups, so far, so good.
2388;He frees a surrenderee (the decent thing) and pays dearly for the kind deed.
2389;It is up there with The Longest day and Patton.
2390;The way the beginning is shown (sort of jumpy, from the eyes of a soldier) is great.
2391;It really makes you feel like you were there.
2392;The sound effects, sets, etc. were all really really good as well.
2393;the story/plot was good, and interesting.
2394;the characters are all believable, and the acting is very good.
2395;The cast was well chosen.
2396;The perspective of this movie was wonderful=) the American solders' experience on D. day looked like footage I've seen of the actual beach it took place on several documentaries.
2397;And it all felt very realistic!
2398;Spielberg did an amasing job of bringing the war to the big screen!
2399;Saving Private Ryan is, by all accounts, an American masterpiece and one of the premier World War II films.
2400;ray has been highly anticipated and, for the most part, it doesn't disappoint.
2401;First of all, the transfer is every bit as astonishingly sharp as expected.
2402;As far as I'm concerned this is an easy five star transfer.
2403;Director Steven Spielberg discusses what attracted him to this project.
2404;Spielberg and Hanks also speak candidly about their interest in World War II in general.
2405;set footage included as well.4) Boot Camp (7:37) .
2406;This features the great Captain Dale Dye discussing how he helped train the actors for their roles, as well as the unique boot camp the actors participated in during production.5) Making Saving Private Ryan (22:05) .
2407;of feature which highlights Spielberg's directing style relative to the film with some outstanding behind the scenes footage.
2408;An interesting feature discussing how the crew mounted the most impressive battle scene of the film.7) Music and Sound (15:59) .
2409;A nice bookend feature that contains bits of interview footage with Hanks and Spielberg.9) Into the Breach: Saving Private Ryan (25:01) .
2410;scenes feature covering production of the film.
2411;I'm definitely glad they included this, but the Making Saving Private Ryan feature is far superior.10) Shooting War (1:28:05) .
2412;Tom Hanks (in full beard, as this was filmed while Cast Away was under production) hosts this feature focusing on the men who filmed and photographed World War II.
2413;Aside from that, this is by far the best release of the film yet.
2414;Very happy with this its so bloody good i am a world war two nutter can,t get enough bring it on .
2415;4/5Story line is wonderful and believable.
2416;Saving private ryan has to be the most acurate and realistic war movie ever made.
2417;a tremendous performance from Tom Hanks who stars as Captain John Miller the leader of the squad and his men ,Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore),Private Reiben (Edward Burns)Private Jackson (Barry Pepper) and a few more.
2418;Spedded up footage, juddering images,faded colour so the film looks old and hand held camera use all contribute to making the film nervous to look at.
2419;All together the film is a cinimatic masterpiece and will make you feel nervous,sad and shocked.
2420;saving private ryan is a landmark mark in film industry everyone over 17 should watch and be stunned by this mindblowing film.
2421;The opening sequence in this film grips the viewer like a soldier grips a yet.
2422;It takes your breath away and make non.
2423;The performances are solid with Tom Sizemore.
2424;possibly turning in the best of all.
2425;The power that bolts off the screens at the bookends of the film is definitely worth the time though.
2426;A must have for those who are interested in this type of movie.
2427;This excellent film, of great interest to French speakers and students of French, does not seem to have options for French dialogue and French subtitles.
2428;The movie is very intense and you can watch it several times and not see everything there is to see.
2429;Tom Hanks, once again, was great.
2430;It's a testament to the bravery, skill and intelligence (and sometimes cowardice) of soldiers that anyone can survive war.
2431;Saving Private Ryan offers as close a look at real combat as one could get without picking up a gun oneself.
2432;The movie has some terrific special effects and is well.
2433;paced and tells a gripping story of courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty.
2434;The film merits its R rating.
2435;the characters in Saving Private Ryan are true.
2436;life, completely believable, and the dialogue in keeping with the WWII era.
2437;made movie and every actor in it turns in a superior performance.
2438;watching this film, I had to think: as our technology has improved, have the results of warfare changed or improved?
2439;I pray that our servicemen continue to demonstrate the bravery and loyalty that led previous generations to fight our battles with honor.
2440;and that our leaders, political and spiritual, have the wisdom and integrity to carefully choose those battles which are truly worth the sacrifice of the precious lives of those who fall on the battlefield.
2441;But as soon as the AFI redid their 10th anniversary ranking, Saving Private Ryan faulted into the #71 spot, right in there with many beloved classics such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane.
2442;It was just that powerful.
2443;Yes, there are good and not.
2444;good actions going on on both sides of the dividing line.
2445;But Saving Private Ryan brought this story to an entirely new level of cinematography.
2446;it is stunning just how many amazing actors are in here.
2447;Every character has grounding and reality and personality.
2448;Part of the joy of watching (and rewatching) the film is connecting with their humanity.
2449;so, that all being said, Saving Private Ryan is an incredible movie, and well worth watching.
2450;As such, it is of a piece with Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation, and the shelf of Stephen Ambrose.
2451;That said, it is still better than any other war movie that I've ever seen.
2452;The beginning, when an old and ailing vet seeks out a cross marking the grave of his benefactor in a Norman cemetary for American war dead, limmed in clear sunlight, is moving.
2453;The rest of the movie, ending excepted, is a flashback, as the camera focuses on his eye, entering it to reveal his memories.
2454;Aside from technical excellence and utterly realistic combat footage (not for the squeamish, but not unnecessarily gory), the movie's most memorable trait is the aura of goodness that it cloaks America in.
2455;Yet, it is believable to the audience that an American would.
2456;Gen. Marshall's reading from Lincoln's actual letter to a Civil War mother who lost all her sons in battle, itself highly idealistic in tone, embodies the theme of the movie, which has to do with the goodness of the American ideal.
2457;This is a sobering film
2458;This is one of his favorites.
2459;It's a fantastic story with incredible acting, directing and production.
2460;For me it's an emotional experience, one that reminds me of what the Greatest Generation did for the world.
2461;Saving Private Ryan is a very good film .
2462;Similarly the end sequence where they defend the bridge is horrifically realistic.
2463;There can be no doubt about their power.
2464;What made Schindlers List such a deeply moving film for me was that for once Speilberg portrayed the Nazi's for what they were .
2465;And that made it powerful.
2466;It is a superior film albeit lacking in the shock value of the D. day landing sequence in SPR.
2467;overall a good film, just not a great one.
2468;My boys love watching this film with me!
2469;My son laughed when he saw vin deisel from riddick!
2470;It's a wonderful saphire series of the classic film with good actors, great story, great script, a film to be seen more than one time.
2471;This movie is so increadably realistic and tells an epic story, about, Cpt.
2472;this movie is the greatest film i have ever seen.
2473;So intense and so well made.
2474;Sure, the beginning of Steven Spielberg's film is captivatingly realistic.
2475;But the very story that follows that beginning weakens what could be a spectacular docu.
2476;We have to look on the soldiers during WWII as being courageous, heroic and very human.
2477;They saved the west, the east and created a new world for us.
2478;it's a marvel in visuals, directing, and story structure.
2479;It's a fantastic film to be sure, and I'm also glad to have it on blu.
2480;This is a great movie, well documented, with excellent acting.
2481;I highly recommend purchasing this movie and watching it many times over.
2482;there is a very good moral lesson taught in this movie.
2483;He loves history and has never seen this movie.
2484;Saving Private Ryan is one of those films that even if you haven't seen it, you've undoubtedly heard about it.
2485;Both this reputation and the rave reviews that the movie has received are completely justified in this reviewer's opinion.
2486;It also makes you understand how lucky you are that these men were willing to give the ultimate sacrifice so that we can enjoy the life we do today.
2487;miller soon gets a special assignment that he questions and makes the viewer question, despite our initial acceptance.
2488;Her son being Private Ryan, and the Squadron chosen being Miller's.
2489;But for the most part they are fairly normal men with normal backgrounds.
2490;The featurette is very good, including clips from the film, interviews with cast and crew, as well as historians like Stephan Ambrose.
2491;I admired this movie immensely.
2492;I think that Steven Spielberg knows how to get to our heart better than anyone.
2493;He makes us feel for the characters right from the start and then we get carried along his roller.
2494;the realism and humanity he reveals to us in this truly exceptional movie encompasses all that is TRUE about war.
2495;jeremy Davies is very convincing as Upham .
2496;This fact becomes very clear to us in a tense moment in the movie.
2497;spielberg also shows us the wonderful role the Medics had in War.
2498;this is a wonderful, heart.
2499;I recommend it to anyone.
2500;Saving Private Ryan is by far the most amazingly spectacular film I have ever seen.
2501;In addition to delivering an important anti.
2502;war message, it also delivers an important series of facts of what the Second World War was like for the average American foot soldier.
2503;D. day has often been described as a 100% successful operation, basically a breeze for our troops and the British.
2504;The film, does an excellent job of removing these misconceptions.
2505;Sights such as these immediately helped my understanding of how powerful this movie truly is.
2506;A sight like that is powerful for anyone to see, much less an 18 year old like me.
2507;Saving Private Ryan is an intense, gritty and violent film about war.
2508;special Features: An Introduction, Looking Into the Past, Miller and his Platoon, Boot Camp, Making 'Saving Private Ryan', Re.
2509;It is often amazing that some people treat World War II as an event in history as opposed to great sacrifices made to prevent evil.
2510;and that is the minds of those individuals.
2511;do yourself a favor and visit Normandy one day.
2512;the graves are sobering, and the concrete bunkers are chilling.
2513;A little gory but that makes it realistic.
2514;I thought this was a terrific movie about people caught up in a war until about 2/3 of the way through when it switched to just another Hollywood war movie.
2515;It was so good up to that point.
2516;this movie has many very good, rich scenes.
2517;yet there were several scenes that I found more powerful and more substantive.
2518;This is one of my favorite all time war movies.
2519;one of my all time favorites, can watch it 1000 times.
2520;This is probably the best ww2 movie I will ever see.
2521;The action is great and the story were Private Ryan(Matt Damon)has to be rescued because all his brothers have died in the war.
2522;This is a very affordable price.
2523;This film is an honest portrayal of the D. day landing and the extraordinary sacrifices made by by everyday men.
2524;The depiction of the landing on Normandy Beach is one the most intense battle scenes I have ever seen.
2525;I feel he captured what it was like to invade the beaches on June 6th.
2526;themed movies made over as many years, however this one really pulls the heart strings for me.
2527;It is an excellent production with terrific acting and and a redeeming ending, if there can be such a thing with war.
2528;I'll agree to some extent with that.
2529;But this movie tells a truth rarely seen in War films.
2530;It's brutally honest, in fact.
2531;Miller's final line in this movie sums up the whole point of the moive: Earn This.
2532;It's time to earn it, and its time to say thank you.
2533;Saving Private Ryan is an excellent War movie.
2534;This is a classic movie about WWII that comes in a cool commemorative case.
2535;Oscar Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Effects/Sound Effects Editing, and Film Editing, and Best Sound.You can smell the salty air of Normandy in the first 10 minutes!
2536;Being a guy, there's nothing better than a good war movie.
2537;Everything Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg touch is gold.
2538;The cinematography is wonderful and the action scenes are very realistic.
2539;Spielberg takes great care to develop some meaningful characters.
2540;Some 2 and a half to 3 hour movies can get pretty painful to watch, but Saving Private Ryan leaves you wanting more.
2541;Sometimes you feel like asking yourself Does it worth living this life?
2542;because most of the time we feel enterly down, a we need a touch to cheer us up.
2543;this movie will be in your heart for ever this is a masterpiece from steven spielber.
2544;A good movie to test your audio syste
2545;Love the story line, and the reality of the actors.
2546;One of the most significant reasons to see this film, is that it is good story telling.
2547;Saving Private Ryan delivers interesting characters that you can easily identify with and emotionally invest in.
2548;War movies have never been my favorite, but this movie is a winner.
2549;Watching this movie shows that very clearly.
2550;the best that depicts what the invasion of Normandy was really like for the United States.
2551;Great movie, so many other good things to say, except I would never allow children to see it.
2552;I see many people on here with one.
2553;gun Nest at the Radar Station, and the Last Stand at the Bridge) are magnificent.
2554;A truly historic film, in both senses of the word.
2555;Well done, and based on a true story.
2556;To be granted such an intimate and horrific look at one of the most pivotal moments in the history of this world, the D. day invasion of the beaches at Normandy, provides us with a stark and brutal look at one of the last campaigns of World War II.
2557;Miller leads a small party of eight men.
2558;It is a companion piece to Spielberg's Holocaust epic, Shindler's List.
2559;A teacher friend of mine.
2560;I think it is the best war movie I have ever seen.
2561;The characters thought and acted like real soldiers, which made the movie come to life.
2562;I would recommend this great movie to anyone who likes James Bond type movies.
2563;It's the 63rd anniversary of the allied invasion of Normandy today so in honor of the fact, I watched this movie!
2564;Nevertheless, I love this film.
2565;This blu ray is the best EVER.
2566;Not sure how this magic masterpiece was created by Mr Spielberg but so glad he did.
2567;I would have to say this movie is the single best war film EVER created and is a great tribute to our American forces who liberated France.
2568;It is as bloody as it is good.
2569;This is an awesome movie!
2570;It is this subtext of ethics versus pragmatism that imbues the film with the multi.
2571;There are numerous scenes in which a soldier will pause while directly involved in a life and death struggle to detach himself from the fray to consider some basic concepts that mark him as human.
2572;Nearly everyone in Capt. Miller's squad also wonders whether their lives are collectively worth the one whose three brothers were killed.
2573;We in the audience can share this most intimate of moments.
2574;The realistic opening battle scene was made all the more riveting for me because my wife's uncle was killed in the D. day landing at Normandy.
2575;Got the movie within a few days and I've already had the pleasure of enjoying it a few times over.
2576;In short, the movie is great (it always has been), and there are plenty of extras to keep one entertained for quite some time.
2577;I was expecting the sharp, crisp lines that I have come to expect from a Blu.
2578;The film has a great cast and it has some spectacular parts which are really intense.
2579;For example, the opening invasion was great.
2580;The knife fight between Mellish and the SS soldier was intense and even bothered some people.
2581;I even liked the interaction between the soldiers during lulls.
2582;I suspect that it's Spielberg injecting himself into the story as some story tellers sometimes do.
2583;One is SS and Willie I think is Luftwaffe.
2584;overall, it's a good film.
2585;I saw it in the theater when it came out, and I have yet to see it again.
2586;But don't get me wrong
2587;i guess Shakespeare in Love and Titanic are better movies then this.
2588;Still, Saving Private Ryan is a riveting, monumental movie, and it is the greatest film about the American experience in World War II.
2589;A few years later, he redeemed himself with the remarkable Empire of the Sun, which dealt with the Japanese occupation of China.
2590;This story of the plight of Jews in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany may be the most honored film ever made.
2591;This very long scene is one of the largest and most ambitious ever filmed.
2592;On the cliffs above are the well fortified German bunkers.
2593;It is decided that he must be found and brought home to his mother.
2594;The movie thankfully implies that this decision is a heartfelt one on the part of the military.
2595;i will give you just a bit of history.
2596;The Normandy Invasion, while well thought out and most likely necessary, came at a very high price.
2597;Captain Miller, in the tradition of the best leaders, keeps his own opinion of the assignment to himself.
2598;He manages to keep his men on track, no matter what their personal feelings are.
2599;tom Hanks is such a fine actor with such an enormous range that it's rather difficult to say which one of his many performances is the finest.
2600;One of the finest elements of this movie is how it reminds us that real heroes are never super human.
2601;They are ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
2602;By emphasizing their ordinariness, Spielburg reminds us that we are all special.
2603;This movie was casted very very well.
2604;They even gave a part to Vin Diesel, which he fit into well.
2605;Saving Private Ryan's intense first 30 minutes have to be the best sound ever laid down for a motion picture.
2606;The first 25 minutes of SPR, as everyone says, are breathtaking and horrifying at the same time.
2607;and another one last thing, to people who like really good war films, I recommend: Paths of Glory, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Patton, Tora Tora Tora, Black Hawk Down, and, please, watch Band of Brothers, it is an INCREDIBLE miniseries.
2608;thanks for reading and farewell.
2609;This is without a doubt Steven Spielberg's best movie (or at least most realistic movie along with Shindler's List).
2610;This is my favorite movie.
2611;It's a war movie, the Best one ever made.
2612;When you see this one scene, you will understand why Spielberg won Best Director.
2613;This movie deserved a lot more oscars, including Best Picture, without a doubt.
2614;What makes this film so amazing is how memorable and realistic it really was.
2615;It should have no doubt, hands down, no questions asked
2616;At least Spielberg shined with the BEST DIRECTOR award!
2617;The opening scene on Omaha Beach really pulls you into the battles or World War II.
2618;There are even times when you almost want to look away!
2619;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is more realistic and more emotional.
2620;All the performances and filming are fantastic.
2621;it's just phenomenal filmaking that all homes should have.
2622;This is a true epic that sticks its story, doesn't have holds, and keeps that drama.
2623;Thank you Steven Spielberg for showing us how much we take for granted, and who we owe so much to.
2624;put yourself on the battlefields of WWII and see how it feels for a day.
2625;I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
2626;That Mr. Spielberg was able to give those characters life and make you cheer for them on top of all this raw emotion is a tribute to his ability as a director.
2627;Great film based on a wonderfully detailed Stephen Ambrose book.
2628;If you have a weak stomach or can't stand the really horrible war pictures you can skip this, there is no important storyline in it and therefore unimportant for the rest of the movie, it is however a brilliant piece of filming.
2629;the movie itself is mostly set in shades of green and grey, making the imagery beautiful and therefore worth seeing.
2630;It's again a great Spielberg movie, especially in its realism and if you want to get a good view about how D. day was see this, maybe together with the great mini.
2631;I have always loved it.
2632;251, our first glipse of Ryan himself is like a visitation, arising from the brush looking like a young Apollo.
2633;life' scenes of suffering and terror coupled with hope are heart.
2634;many of the actual combatants of the D. day landings which this film is based around, verify the 'close to reality' nature of some of the scenes.
2635;this is a fitting epitaph to the memory of those who were there.
2636;Captain John Miller is ordered to take his squad behind enemy lines on a dangerous mission to find and retrieve one man, the youngest of the four brothers who have all been killed in action within days of one another, and hw is the last survivor among them.
2637;mISSION: SAVING PRIVATE RYANWorld War II was a pivotal event of the 20th century and a defining moment for America and the world.
2638;This film is most certainly a wake.
2639;Spielberg grabs history and rips it open to leave the exposed bleeding heart of man.
2640;In comprehending this, we begin again to appreciate our own mortality, to take a look around and re.
2641;We all wish to spend a truly peaceful, Merry Christmas and a new year.
2642;avid viewer of wwII movies.
2643;This is so real without all the hollywood hype and is very moving with incredible acting.
2644;It moved my dad (who served) to tears and my dad doesn't choke up easily.
2645;It is factual but has a great deal of the human element.
2646;I know I'll watch it again and again over the years.
2647;A needed reminder of the great sacrifice so many have made for the sake of our country and their comrades.
2648;My son loves this particular movie because the scene at Omaha Beach is so life like!
2649;If you love war movies, this one is excellent!
2650;In this movie, the battle sequences are the best ever made.
2651;I guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us, it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film.
2652;The landing and ground fighting shown in the Normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing!Tom Hanks is brilliant as a shell.
2653;shocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service.
2654;That is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the Ryan clan.
2655;the movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in Hanks search for the last Ryan.
2656;what made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story!
2657;Spielberg creates yet another masterpiece.
2658;this one best picture of 1998 and it deserved its award.
2659;a bloody and rewarding film
2660;In viewing this incomparable essay on the human spirit and the value of every human life, one can't help but be enthralled with the cinematic genius of Stephen Spielberg, his unbelievable cast, cinematographers, editors, sound men, special effects.
2661;truly the consummate cinematic experience.
2662;from the devastating opening sequence on the beaches of Normandy to the cataclysmic battle for the bridge, Spielberg helms a movie that is gutwrenching in its honesty, in its portrayal of war, and of the men who fought it.
2663;Tom Hanks is truly magnificent as Capt. John Miller
2664;intelligent, thoughtful and convincing performances from them all.
2665;They even gave Judi Dench an Oscar for 8 minutes of hysterics, and ignored such Oscar worthy performances as Burns, Sizemore or Ribisi.
2666;no matter, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not only the best movie of 2001, but one of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood.You owe it to yourself to watch this classic!
2667;ray is a somewhat improved version IMO.
2668;A great movie made better.
2669;Great action and great fun for somebody who was not there and did not see combat.
2670;In real life it is a crock fom start to finish but a good film.
2671;Well shaved, clean boots, not jock itch, no bugs, well fed, well mannered, well spoken.
2672;Lots of Gore, lots of bull and no doubt for some that were not there lots of fun.
2673;The picture is well made but War it ain't.
2674;As War movies go at least you will not vomit from disgust at this one but to some it is funny.
2675;This was one of the best movies I ever saw, and I've been seeing them since 1949.
2676;It easily makes my top 20, maybe even top 10.
2677;alike location for Omaha Beach, the construction and set decoration of the French town (actually done on an air base in England), and the use of very authentic.
2678;looking uniforms, weapons, and vehicles made this movie stand out as the best war movie ever made, and I've seen all the good ones.
2679;Hanks' acting and the performances of the other men in his squad were outstanding.
2680;One reviewer called the movie a visceral experience, and that's what it was for me.
2681;Fear, excitement, triumph, tragedy, and at last some kind of satisfaction, even if not complete, marked this as a very emotional experience.
2682;This film and Schindler's List, Spielberg's two best, are more like experiences than movies.
2683;It's interesting that Spielberg's two best films, as well as his third best ( Empire of the Sun ) are the ones that are the most realistic and rely the least on special effects.
2684;See it if you haven't already, and you probably have.
2685;like about 'Saving Private Ryan' is the realism of the landing scenes.
2686;although paying tribute to those men who went ashore in '44, it's also a strong anti.
2687;enjoy may be too strong a word, but watch this movie just the same and if by chance you know somebody who was there, then simply, thank them.
2688;For many people who will view this movie, will be amaszed on how grafic and realistic the landing was.
2689;The storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat.
2690;This is one of the best Normandy Invasion films I've seen.
2691;The stark realism adequately portrays the horror of war and the plight of our soldiers as they stormed the beaches.
2692;Overall it's ust a great film.
2693;This is a great movie, I saw it long ago.
2694;A films vivid depiction of WAR and all the human elements involved therein, every American should see this movie, it should be part of school curriculum in my opinion.
2695;I have seen this movie many times but I it's one of those you can see nmero use times and still enjoy!
2696;I remember staying home from high school to go see this movie when it came out in the theater.
2697;It was great and still is, and it has a new meaning after i served in the Army after seeing this movie.
2698;The clarity and sound were outstanding.
2699;The additional disk with the behind the scenes information was very informative and a pleasure to watch.
2700;Great movie for an even better price.
2701;No one doubts Spielberg is a master filmmaker, and few directors are so adept at manipulating the audience's emotions as he.
2702;He's also a master image.
2703;There is everything here .
2704;intense drama and suspense, heroes overcoming incredible odds, humor, pathos, internal conflict within the good guy camp, plenty of shooting and explosions, a main character we identify with and care about.
2705;Viewed as pure action film this movie has few equals and I would gladly award it five stars if it billed itself as such.
2706;By taking this tack, he surrenders the right to have his film judged by its story and style alone.
2707;Miller present that day, and through simple dogged courage they did force open the draws under heavy fire.
2708;He wants to show Cpt.
2709;Now the wisdom of this, given the squad's mission, can be debated.
2710;arms combat viewing this scene and concluding that Cpt Miller knows a thing about leading infantry.
2711;There are great movies and then there are *GREAT* movies, movies that touch you in a deeply personal way.
2712;why is this such a brilliant movie?
2713;The direction by Steven Spielberg is magnificent.
2714;The opening 40 minutes of the movie, the bloody U. s. landing on Omaha Beach, is a stunning experience.
2715;Bullets whiz by, soldiers die and it feels like you are right there!The acting is right on as well.
2716;Tom Hanks as Capt. Miller, the squad leader, is nothing short of brilliant.
2717;He effortlessly captures the spirit of the men who went abroad to fight.
2718;the music by John Williams is perfect.
2719;But the story is what really works.
2720;one of the finest movies I have ever seen in my life.
2721;This is an interesting film but marred in all sorts of funny ways: yukky setimentality intrudes and damages what could have been a very great film.
2722;the opening sequence is based on a similar one in a German film called Stalingrad, and has great impact.
2723;He is presented as an heroic figure when we first see him, holding a bazooka.
2724;The movie itself is in my opinion great.
2725;Nothing special that was impressive or noteworthy.
2726;Saving Private Ryan tells the story of a United States Army captain (played by Tom Hanks) who, during World War II, is sent on a special mission in Europe: he and his team are to find and bring home a young soldier named Private Ryan.
2727;The combat scenes are brutally intense and graphic.
2728;steven Spielberg directs an excellent ensemble cast.
2729;The rest of the cast does equally admirable work.
2730;In the end, Saving Private Ryan is a well.
2731;made film that is often disturbing, often moving, but always attentive to high human cost of war.
2732;Well, I feel as if I have been in a battle just from watching this harrowing, brilliant film.
2733;I never appreciated so much what they did for us, those heroic men.
2734;This film is incredibly well.
2735;I highly recommend it but it's not for the kids!
2736;The video and audio of the movie are great.
2737;My hands off to Dreamworks and Mr. Spielberg for putting out a great product.
2738;steven spielberg great directorshould make any war veteran happy
2739;Even overall, I'll admit, the film was entertaining and emotional.
2740;But it was NOT one of the greatest war movies ever made.
2741;in sum,if you don't like to think when you watch movies, and if you want stories spoon fed to you, then Saving Private Ryan is a true masterpiece.
2742;I had recently seen this movie for the 1st time and as a very amateur history buff thought it to be very realistic, very good movie which will shock you and really keep you glued to watching it.
2743;This film is great for many reasons, technical and dramatic.
2744;They were, indeed, the greatest generation.
2745;Although it is not as noticeable in the home theater arena, the sound is amazing.
2746;more importantly, they captured the feel of the approaching tanks.
2747;little things about the movie have always impressed me.
2748;anyways, this is a great movie, probably the best war movie of our generation (though there is a lot of competition).
2749;This is one of my favorite movies.
2750;That title belongs to Schindler's List.
2751;While not being directly about the war, it shows us the Holocaust with more honesty than we have ever seen or ever will see.
2752;it was a true story of Friendship and Loyality.
2753;Touching to the heart and true to the soul.
2754;Saving Private Ryan is one of the Best Movies I've ever seen in my life.
2755;The best WWII film ever made.
2756;There is an aura to this movie.
2757;The way the colors are sort of drab and drowned out is amazing.
2758;It gives you a sense of being there.
2759;I pray that someone makes something close to how good this is some day.
2760;The men who fought in World War II made immense sacrifices to earn us a better world.
2761;and outstanding movie on every count.
2762;Tom Hanks and a great cast do a wonderful job in this epic war movie.
2763;This is one of my favorite movies.
2764;The story, acting, and direction are top notch.
2765;This gives the look of a B&W movie with still allowing color.
2766;The combat scenes ar some of the most realistic I have ever seen on film.
2767;The differences in the DD and the DTS tracks were pretty good.
2768;a beautiful and stunning tribute to the heroes of WWII, Saving Private Ryan will affect you deeply.
2769;Its real strength is introducing characters that you really care about and identify with.
2770;This film puts YOU in the shoes of the fighting men.
2771;and that is the most frightening and effective part of all.
2772;I found it amazing that these men had the courage to do what they did.
2773;tom Hanks is at his usual best as the main character, and Matt Damon shines as well.
2774;The sound and visual impact are unequaled.
2775;An elderly man, followed by his family, walks as if compelled toward a single grave.
2776;As the troop transports approach Omaha Beach, the eerie sense of calm gives way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most powerful statements ever put on film.
2777;It is discovered that a sole surviving brother has parachuted somewhere in France.
2778;director Steven Spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the surface and he does it once again with a film which is gut.
2779;i agree with those who say that Spielberg puts us, his audience, into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening moments until the film's end.
2780;It is a masterful piece of filmmaking that makes us feel that we have survived, although we were never in danger.
2781;saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece.
2782;I should start this review by saying that Saving Private Ryan is one of my favorite movies so I have a biased opinion.
2783;what I loved about this movie is that it didn't make war look glamorous or desirable.
2784;After a huge battle or conflict you could actually see on the actors faces that they were scared and shaken.
2785;The first 20 minutes of the invasion scene is brutal and very realistic.
2786;What I love about Steven Speilbergs movies is that he lets you get to know the characters.
2787;All of the actors do a great job and are very credible and act like soldiers.
2788;I highly recommend this movie!
2789;First, how realistically does it portray D. day and the fighting in Normandy?
2790;Here, it is unparalleled and a remarkable feat of film making.
2791;The D. day invasion sequence is the most powerful 20 minutes of film, ever.
2792;The squad's subsequent journey through Normandy to find Private Ryan is also very good.
2793;There is a real sense of how scattered the American troopers (esp.
2794;setting aside the issue of how accurately the film portrays the fighting, is it a good movie?
2795;key but has clearly earned the respect of his men.
2796;The supporting cast was also great.
2797;I particularly liked the sniper.
2798;By and large the plot is a good one, but I have to agree with those who felt like the ending was a little too predictable and Hollywood .
2799;Nevertheless, this is a powerful movie, and one everyone should see at least once.
2800;It's clear that there was an extra effort made to make the special features worthy of the film.
2801;This movie is very moving, very realistic and very sad.
2802;War is not pretty and it this movie does an awesome job of helping people understand what soldiers have to go through.
2803;There wasn't extensive dialouge, however the dialogue was powerful.
2804;The acting was incredible, by all.
2805;The picture and editing was also top notch.
2806;The movie gives you the sense of steping in someone's shoes who has fought war.
2807;After watching it, it will either provoke memories for some or help those, without memories, understand in a deeper way.
2808;SPR has got to be one of the best and most realistic WWII movie I have ever seen in regards to what the bloodshed was really like and the confusion some people felt over it.
2809;for the record, I've seen over 50 WWII movies.
2810;interesting, gritty and bloody war scenes.
2811;First off, everything you may have heard about the opening Normandy sequence is true: this is quite simply the most amazing battle re.
2812;The first time I saw it, I was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well.
2813;There are still several compelling scenes here, and Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career (his dramatic career anyway .
2814;But by all means see this movie.
2815;and the opening alone is worth the cost.
2816;Trust me, if you are contemplating the money difference between the DD and DTS versions, the extra bucks are worth it.
2817;The opening scenes are incredibly difficult to watch, but the film is so compelling that it is worth it.
2818;Having visited the sites where this film is set, it makes it all the more fascinating to watch.
2819;Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast of actors in this film.
2820;It really is a must see movie for anyone who wants to see what sacrifices were required to stop Hilter in Europe.
2821;The depiction of Omaha in this movie shows you what it must have been like.
2822;The battle scenes are incredible and so is the movie overall.
2823;Though you hear the Sullivan boys mentioned in the movie they actually got the idea on another group of brothers.
2824;I also recommend the great 1962 film on D. day, The Longest Day.
2825;I have total respect for our veterans!
2826;I would recommend this movie.
2827;I personaly think that Saving Private Ryan is the best movie i have ever seen.
2828;Excellently casted and directed, Saving Private Ryan is and forever will be the best movie I have ever seen.
2829;I have become patriotic in my 40's and I'm proud to live in America.
2830;then a rush of emotion hit that caused me to cry with such intensity that my best friend, a man, had to go back into the theater and get napkins to absorb the moisture from my tears.
2831;it was also about the incredible price of freedom that most people take for granted.
2832;One of my best war movies.
2833;Tom Hank is great as always.
2834;Still love it after many times watching it.
2835;While theres no doubt that Saving Private Ryan made an invaluable contribution to the war movie genre, utilising new technology and an up.
2836;Still, its miles better than the former D. day benchmark movie, The Longest Day, and shows the sheer scope and depth of Spielbergs vision.
2837;concerning is best among your Comrades !
2838;Saving Private Ryan is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names, some of whom became even bigger after the film, (eg.
2839;the film opens with the harrowing D. day landings, following Captain Miller and his men.
2840;a lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between Miller and those around him.
2841;There are some truly light hearted moments, such as the pool that is running to find out what Miller did before the war.
2842;this is a profoundly moving movie, and one that I have seen more than once.
2843;It is simply a great story, well.
2844;Definitely, the most gripping and realistic account of what this war was like.
2845;Saving Private Ryan, is without question one of the finest war movies ever made.
2846;possibly one of the finest movies ever.
2847;the acting is very good all around.
2848;Hanks received an Oscar nomination, but the rest of the cast is excellent, most notably Davies and Edward Burns.
2849;i was shocked that Saving Private Ryan didn't win Best Picture.
2850;It was one of the Academy's most shamefull moments.
2851;Luckily, Spielberg won for Best Director.
2852;It also won for Cinematography, which was basically all hand.
2853;held during the battle scenes.
2854;That is indeed a rare thing.
2855;this is the best movie about war and has the most realistic battle scenes i have ever seen.
2856;i've seen combat up close and this is like it is.
2857;Every aspect of this film is outstanding.
2858;I'm sure this has been said many times so I'll say it again, it's the best war movie ever made.
2859;Terrific acting ,story telling, and realistic depiction of war.
2860;You feel the adrenaline, the terror, the fear, the confusion.
2861;It is fast paced, remarkable storytelling.
2862;First rate all the way.
2863;'Ryan' took a simple story and turned it into something extraordinary, both an unflinching look at the random slaughter of warfare, and a portrait of ordinary people voluntarily stuck in an unimaginably inhuman situation, with solid acting from an odd cast.
2864;hour strikes an extremely precise balance between being exciting and utterly terrifying.
2865;A film about a significant subject is not, in itself, unassailable, but as with 'Schindler's List' this it not just a film about momentous events, it's a great film about momentous events.
2866;This film was splendid with a lot of action!
2867;The director really made you feel as if you were there with the camera angles that were used.
2868;The opening sequences are horrific and if that's something people feel the need to witness in real life or as realistic dramatisation, well thank God I decided long ago not to bring children into this world.
2869;i think you're great, my favourite film ever is 'Empire of the Sun' (also set in WW2 and a film I highly recommend).
2870;2 stars for your directing style which is always great.
2871;Without doubt this movie ranks in my top 5 of all time favourites!
2872;The most astonishing start to any movie I have ever seen (Ghost Ship comes close), this movie is just incredible.
2873;Speilberg and Hanks have done us all a favor and created a film that will stay with you for a long time.
2874;The violence and destruction is realistic, the acting is perfect (and the actors are cast perfectly) and watching it on blu.
2875;ray on a large screen hi.
2876;def with big audio will simply rivet you to the story.
2877;One other benefit of watching this movie to me.
2878;It is written like no movie before it, with a plot that is superb, and a musical score and cinimitography to go with it.
2879;I give this movie an A+ in a heartbeat.
2880;The Into the Breach section is espicially enjoyable.
2881;Among other things, it gives us an look at Speilberg's earliest attempts at film making.
2882;This is in fact a historically documented fact that I'd never known about.
2883;Once this movie was on the play, it draws my attention immediately.
2884;this is a must seen movie.
2885;Well, I just bought a home theater system and WOW!
2886;It's an excellent film no matter what, but the home theater experience will amaze you!
2887;Wnat you've heard is true.
2888;What you've heard is true.
2889;Saving Private Ryan is a great war film.
2890;As I said, I admire Ryan for its realism of war, but as for characters, I didnt find it that appealing.
2891;how could Ryan get Best Director Oscar but not Best Picture?
2892;A film that entertains and provokes feelings.
2893;Brilliant actors (Ryan, played by Matt Damon, in his hayday) playing their roles with natural ease.
2894;Maybe one of the best war movies I ever have seen.
2895;Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made, if not the best.
2896;Kubrick, perhaps the best director of all time, did make a great film, I love Full Medal Jacket, but that movie does not catch the horrors of war, but instead the individual experience of training and the effects of war on man.
2897;They are both good films, but Saving Private Ryan is a better war film.
2898;It is a great movie, about the effects of war on men, and how they see it, while they are in the heat of it.
2899;And how they long for something great, something we all take for granted these days.
2900;Epic movie, bought it so I could watch it again and again.
2901;Works fine from my Amazon library.
2902;On the flip side, it is cool that I can open my amazon account on a diff comp and pull this up.
2903;This is great movie making in everyway.
2904;The effects are amazing, the acting is brilliant and the live action scenes seem real in every way.
2905;Nothing can prepare you for the realism of the violence in this picture, and while parts of it may be graphic at times, it is necessary and fits well in to the film.
2906;I had seen this movie many times before I bought it, and learned so much about the battle of Normandy and facts about the film from the special features on disc 2.
2907;The boot camp for the cast was most interesting, especially the fact that all the cast were put into boot camp except for Matt Damon, so the rest of the cast would resent him as they do in the movie.
2908;everybody should own this movie, it is a history lesson and and cinematic masterpiece at the same time.
2909;the movie of course is great.
2910;It's an incredibly deep and moving look into the lives of soldiers and the horrors they had to endure during World War II, as well as the comradery and affection for eachother that develops through such harsh trials and uplifting victories.
2911;This has got to be one of the best Blu.
2912;The audio is also one of the best out there.
2913;The transfer was great in the fact they kept the grittiness and greyness of how Spielberg shot the film.
2914;ray fans and military movie fans alike.
2915;Great movie, unfortunately this Blu Ray film has a audio.
2916;Excellent camera and video shots of intense military action.
2917;feels like you are actually part of the picture.
2918;It was brilliant when it came out and still is today.
2919;you feel personally there, in the action, with your mission.
2920;You can also see white, cloudy images showing up on the screen now and again.
2921;One good American?What was the message?
2922;made movies I have ever seen!
2923;It is very graphic and dramatic, but I'm sure many people will love this movie!
2924;The case resembles a war journal, which adds more excitement, rather than just a plan and simple case.
2925;Luckily it still works good.
2926;I highly recommend the 2 disc special edition, if your interested in bonus content.
2927;Awesome movie, this is probably my favorite war movie of all time.
2928;Great story and even better action!
2929;Saving Private Ryan was the finest, most suspenseful, and overall most realistic war movie I have ever seen.
2930;I found this movie the most accurate and, by far, best depiction of WWII I have ever seen.
2931;A definite must see for anyone and everyone!
2932;Just ordered this and watched it (for about the 10th time hehe) with my sound system, and it is a WOW!
2933;The graininess of the film is spot on to give you that war.
2934;time feel and I never thought I would talk about them, but the special features are just as great as the movie itself!
2935;ray, if you have a good sound system and a Blu.
2936;Recommend this to anyone, not only is it a great war film, but it is very touching no matter who you are you will most definitely be engaged in the very dramatic and well directed story that goes along with it.
2937;This movie is one thing to watch and another to see.
2938;it looks gorgeous, stunning and so personal.
2939;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
2940;it has everything: realism, a great story and great acting.
2941;Very cool and well done.
2942;When I was young I loved Spielberg but now I can't stand him.
2943;He knows nothing of honest drama and pathos.
2944;He actually WAVES THE FLAG at the ending of this movie!
2945;Has Spielberg ever actually read a book?
2946;Grow up, for the love of Man!
2947;Truly amazing film about war, and the effects were spectacular in the dts format.
2948;I also dislike the Spielbergian close.
2949;Its documentary approach to telling its story helped Spielberg to stay clear of his usual blunders (At least until the end of the film, when Spielberg could no longer control himself).
2950;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is just one long testament to America as a nation.
2951;The film opens with the American flag.
2952;It provokes me because it has turned World War 2 into a clash between America and Germany.
2953;But Spielberg certainly intends to undermine the role Europe played in achieving allied victory.
2954;i think it's important for a war film to show us the individuals it depicts.
2955;BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is another example of a great war film.
2956;DAS BOOT is perhaps the greatest war film ever made.
2957;As an amateur WWII historian, this movie was a rare and wonderful opportunity to peek into the past and get a realistic glimpse of what D. day was like for those on Omaha Beach.
2958;Spielberg does a masterful job of portraying the unbridled horror of the beach assault, which in itself is a must.
2959;It's a great reminder of the price which has been paid to preserve basic human liberties.
2960;from a historical perspective, it was great to see the director's attention to some minute details for the sake of authenticity.
2961;The uniforms, the equipment and the general tenor of the movie were indeed realistic and convincing.
2962;No doubt a great deal of research went into this production.
2963;The story weaves together mens loyalties to each other, to duty, to self.
2964;When orders mean being part of something that seems insane but becomes something honorable and noble.
2965;This is my all time favorite movie, and in Blu ray its like watching it for the very first time !
2966;This film is a horrific vision of World War II.
2967;This is surprising, because usually the Army will not go out of the way to retrieve one single man.
2968;At the beginning of the film, director Steven Speilberg takes us to the front line.
2969;Showing this gives movie patrons a shell shock of realism and emotion, and it's hard to find a movie that can do that to us.
2970;The movie puts that aside and brings a glimmer of morals into the war.
2971;This movie has excellent character development.
2972;The team of six people is introduced to us well, and the characters are written wonderfully.
2973;Everyone on the team has an original personality.
2974;Since we are forced to watch a slow, painful, and gruesome death, this is a great loss to us, and an emotional shock.
2975;This movie is a serious roller coaster ride for mature audiences.
2976;Speilberg is a wonderful director for taking us on such a journey without compromise.
2977;02.04.14 This is the best ever war movie made.
2978;It is superb, exquisite and extremely well acted.
2979;I think the camera work of janusz Kaminski is the finest action achievement of all time.
2980;You can't feel your legs and you, above all, refuse to move towards the enemy.
2981;Adancing is beyond you ability.
2982;As you watch the terror, you see men, big, strong young men, being b lown into the air, legs and arms severed, and blood spraying everywhere.
2983;And, that's how I dfeel when I see this great and epic film, THE greatest War film of all time.
2984;Some of the most moving scenes of this movie are of the aging Private Ryan at a cemetary in Normandy.
2985;In this movie, the invasion of Normandy at Omaha Beach is depicted with great amounts of gore, heroism and violence.
2986;Managing to miraculously locate Private Ryan, Captain Miller's company joins up with some survivors from the 101st with the goal of not only keeping Private Ryan alive, but holding the town from a counterattack by the 2nd SS and hold the town until relieved.
2987;though there are some historical problems with the movie (that unoccupied territory between the Omaha beachhead and the airborne troops I found implausible), I found the drama compelling.
2988;Even so, the most moving scenes to me are in the cemetary as Private Ryan contemplates the gift he received and the cost of that gift.
2989;It certainly made me stop and think about the gifts of freedom I have and enjoy and how many lives and dreams have been lost in my behalf.
2990;paramount has done a hell of a job with the Sapphire Series, I have 'Gladiator' 'Braveheart' and 'Saving Private Ryan' both Gladiator and this look and sound fantastic with nice extras, I have yet to watch my Braveheart, but when I do, I will be back to review it, I can't wait!
2991;This WWII film is definitely one of Spielberg's crowning achievement as a director and film producer.
2992;Although a rather stereotypical story and arrangement of characters, the technical brilliance involved in the combat scenes more than makes up for the defects.
2993;I think Roman Polanski, who is also Jewish, handles the subtleties of WWII much better in his film 'The Pianist'(a really true story and outstanding film!)
2994;don't get me wrong, this is truly one of the best WWII films ever made in terms of accuracy and special effects.
2995;I find Spielberg's production of 'Band of Brothers' to be far superior to this film in terms of story line with action and effects that are just as realistic and authentic.
2996;and watch one of the finest motion pictures on war I have ever seen.
2997;Tom Hanks nails his role big time.
2998;after seeing it twice in the theaters several years ago.
2999;I'm not a great movie buff, but this was special.
3000;From the traumatic opening sequence to the sad ending, Saving Private Ryan is the best war movie available.
3001;This movie is a realistic portrayel of the Normandy beach landing and the events after.
3002;saving Private Ryan uses totally authentic gear and weaponry along with an excellent cast.
3003;On this day we celebrate independence, I remember Saving Private Ryan.
3004;arguing which is Speilberg's best film is probably a futile exercise.
3005;No one succeeds on their own.
3006;Any success you achieve is on the shoulders of soldiers who fought so that you would have the ability to succeed.
3007;4) EARN this . . . earn it, Captain Miller said with a bullet in his chest.
3008;This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory.
3009;Handsome packaging, vibrant colors and awesome sound make this an amazing film to own.
3010;Great bits make not a great movie.
3011;Come on, any film that extends a scene comprised entirely of soldiers in combat to 25 minutes is seriously pushing its luck, no matter how 'worthy' the subject matter.
3012;The final battle is perhaps the most engrossing part of an otherwise limp movie.
3013;Saving Private Ryan is essentially a terrific two hour movie fighting to get out of a tiresome three hour running time.
3014;I thought, Thank goodness that's over.
3015;I confess I'm still wondering.
3016;One of the best war movies, or any movie for that matter, ever made.
3017;Shows inteanse realistic combat, and the comradery between men who serve in war together.
3018;Great story, supported by great acting, directing and special effects.
3019;I recommend seeing them both.
3020;This, too, was on my grandson's Christmas list and we'll be sure to enjoy it over the school holiday break.
3021;it seems Steven was having fun trying to create new and moderns specil effects showing people being butchered!
3022;i give that honor ot Oliver Stone's brilliant Platoon .
3023;this film tells the story of a squad of closely.
3024;If anything, the interludes between action sequences allows you to catch your breath, beyond going a long way towards letting the viewer really get to know the characters.
3025;Picture clarity is superb, with the opening landing craft scene always giving me a sense that I'm there with the crew.
3026;Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.
3027;I recommend proudly owning this treasure and watching every year.
3028;The best of the best!
3029;highly recommended for your collection.
3030;Let me start of with this, This movie is proibably my favorite and among the best war films ever made.
3031;It is interesting to see how the movie was made but I think they should have also thrown in a d. day documentary or two and things of that nature.
3032;If you are satisfied by what you have read you can stop now.
3033;It covers D. day and many of the events in the movie are representative of the Normandy campaign in general.
3034;This is true, however, individual units were assigned individual objectives.
3035;While watching the stupid Krauts being mowed down by the dozen you keep asking yourself how they managed to conquer all of Europe in the first place.
3036;Those solders fighting in the town at the end are SS.
3037;There was a preliminary air and sea bombardment of the beaches.
3038;It is completely realistic that there is no air and sea cover during the battle, and the Americans overran the beach without it.
3039;The movie portrays Miller as less of an officer and more of a peer to the men which was often the case.
3040;Also, it shows the soldiers questioning their orders and talking and joking with each other.
3041;This scene is definitely Hollywood.
3042;The movie itself is easily 5 stars.
3043;One of the most touching movies I've ever seen.
3044;It really brings home what others went through so we can enjoy freedom.
3045;makers, the overall impression of SPR is still titillation and the ghoulish wonder of combat.
3046;A small pamphlet comes inside the package, with an interesting read about Spielberg and the film.
3047;In the menu, you have the choice of picking certain scenes with a very impressive moving scene index, and you can choose to have English subtitles.
3048;The special features are put together very well.
3049;You have a special message from Steven Spielberg, a behind the scenes featurette titled Into The Beach , the theatrical and re.
3050;Saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, a real tribute to those that put their lives on the line over 50 years ago.
3051;Spielberg has created a film with top notch production values.
3052;The cinematography and sound design, as well as the production design are incredible.
3053;It is very clean with beautiful detail and a look and style that is amazing, especially during the battle scenes.
3054;The cinematographer Janusz Kamisnki, who I had the pleasure of working with once, did an exceptional job of bringing the viewer right into the extreme chaos of war, and creating a visual experience unlike any previous war movie ever seen.
3055;Incredibly realistic, unbelievably clean with beautifully recorded music and crisp, clear dialogue.
3056;ups, the sound is amazing.
3057;Deep bass is well used throughout the battle scenes, so your subwoofer will have an extreme workout.
3058;In conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an excellent, well produced film.
3059;A real tribute to those who risked their lives in World War II.
3060;an amazing treat for the eyes and ears.
3061;Aside from a terrific story and top.
3062;notch performances by a stellar cast and brutally graphic realistic cinematography, this film poses a an important moral question for all of us.
3063;Miller tells Ryan, Earn this .
3064;a metaphor for us as a nation.
3065;(warning: may contain spoiler) The most noteworthy contribution of this film to the genre of the war film is it's realism in depicting scenery and battle scenes.
3066;Initially, it keeps people guessing as to the identity of the old man in the film's beginning but that only works once.
3067;I still think the film highly noteworthy but I can no longer see it as truly great.
3068;But here it is nonetheless, probably the best war movie (and most visually stunning anti.
3069;this is Spielberg's tribute to the GIs who took on the mighty Wehrmacht and defeated it.
3070;why is this the finest war and anti.
3071;It is probably the closest one will ever see to the real thing.
3072;Spielberg, with the assistance of an outstanding cast, shows us that all too vividly.
3073;The argument is a sound one, but it also shows the compassionate side of the huge and mostly unwieldy war machine of the United States of the time.
3074;He is portrayed as alternately frightened and heroic.
3075;Barry Pepper still did an outstanding job in the role and had I been in that situation on D. day +1, I would have wanted someone like him along.
3076;Later in the movie, he quotes Emerson to Captain Miller and during this interchange, we come to realize that there is much, much more to the heroic officer than meets the eye.
3077;In the scenes where Upham fails as a soldier and fails his fellow GIs, Spielberg allows the young actor, Jeremy Davies to realize an outstanding performance.
3078;It is just one of many in this incredible movie, but it is the most memorable.
3079;It was an understated role, delivered with mastery and precision.
3080;I actually believed I was listening to this man and thought he would have made a fine infantry officer
3081;time Oscar winner was not the recipient of a third award.
3082;Like Spencer Tracy, who was also nominated more than twice (and won twice), the Oscar went elsewhere.
3083;everything is accurate about this movie.
3084;The uniforms, the coloring, the insignia, the weaponry, the locales.
3085;As I watched the movie and all the carnage it portrayed, I developed a new respect for my father's generation.
3086;It is also a masterful tribute to a generation of men the likes of which America doesn't seem to be capable of producing any more.
3087;This is their movie and Steven Spielberg has done an eloquent job of telling their story.
3088;after seeing this movie, I have developed a much deeper respect for my father and men like him.
3089;It was the perfect choice and arrived in great condition exactly as the seller specified
3090;I think this was the best movie about World War II
3091;Yes, it's carnage, it's horrible, it's relentless, it's bloody, it's random death, it's a portrayal of fear and courage and raw coincidence.
3092;But it's also one of the most powerful pieces of cinematography ever filmed.
3093;there are many other scenes that have stayed with me during the years since I last saw this unforgettable film, perhaps Spielberg's best ever.
3094;Perhaps the most poignant one that comes immediately to mind is the woman whose sons are all away at war.
3095;and thus is born the search for the surviving son, to bring him home to his momma.
3096;tom Hanks, with his own persona of morality and honesty, is perfectly cast as the good Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier charged with this onerous task, and of course there is terrible cost.
3097;saving Private Ryan is the film Spielberg HAD to make.
3098;A great war film .
3099;The film has obviously been made with care and attention to detail, but I think most people who watch it will only remember it for the first part.
3100;This is a special effects demo.
3101;Spielberg is a gifted technician, but not a great moviemaker.
3102;When watching a Spielberg movie, I never get the sense that Spielberg is laying his life on the line.
3103;i hope that one day Spielberg will start making movies that move me.
3104;Until then, I can only enjoy the magic of his technique.
3105;I hope that this is the closest that I ever come to combat in my life.
3106;Thank God for the men that put their lives on the line to keep us, and the world, free.
3107;That should be enough for all of us to make a promise to ourselves to personally thank as many vets as we can for serving to keep us free.
3108;This movie teaches a lot about sacrifice, courage, heroism, and emotion.
3109;A great movie for this era.
3110;this captures a little bit of what was special about that generation.
3111;A must see for all kids as soon as they are capable of handling it.
3112;What sets Saving Private Ryan apart from many other war films is its stunning portrayal of combat.
3113;spielberg's commentary on WWII is not the masterpiece that many purport it to be, but it is still a fine film.
3114;Just one note of caution: There are two very powerful, graphic acts in this film: the D. day landing that occurs about ten minutes into the opening and the defense of the bridge that basically concludes the film.
3115;leadership: Miller's (Hanks) initiative and direction at the D. day landing shows the the use and importance of flexible, determined action to reach the goal.
3116;He can because he must and he sees each death as the price of winning the war war.
3117;A good class discussion could ensue.
3118;creativity: When Miller illustrates the use of the sticky bomb and deploys his small force, we get a lesson in creative use of available resources in a tough situation.
3119;Marshall reads it to his staff as a method to motivate and inspire them to save Private Ryan and he is so moved by the letter, he sets it aside and recites the closing paragraph from memory.
3120;i am always moved by Miller's dying words: Earn this!
3121;Watch this film and perhaps you can learn a few lessons and, hopefully, understand.
3122;Getting an 82% favorable rating is very good and it puts the 11% Unfavorable in context.
3123;Saving Private Ryan is certainly the most real WWII movie ever written and directed.
3124;There's nothing beautiful about it and even the most heroic deeds are just another massacre.
3125;hanks is brilliant as the leader and no bad words can be said about the rest of the cast either.
3126;Finally, SPR really deserved the oscars given to it
3127;Spielberg did such an amazing job that it left me and my father in tears.
3128;And while the landing scenes were memorable to most viewers, the other battle scenes were very powerful and accurate.
3129;This movie is not only good, it is valuable to our veterans.
3130;See this movie if you know a battle veteran.
3131;that somebody shows how much must those guys suffer for freedom and peace.
3132;it's one of a kind.
3133;Watching this film is a genuinely life.
3134;The graphic, and extremely necessary, depictions of World War 2, the amazing cinemetography by the amazing Janusz Kaminski, the extraordinary direction by the always dependable Steven Spielberg, and the unbeatable performances by the stellar, first.
3135;rate cast, led by, in my eyes, the best actor of his or possibly any generation, Tom Hanks.
3136;This film is astoundind from every aspect.
3137;wrenching opening on the beaches of Normandy during the infamous D. day invasion on June 6th, 1944, to the climactic end battle scene, this film stays thrilling every moment.
3138;But this film, no question, has the best film making, acting, entertainment, and connection with the viewer that I have ever seen.
3139;So see Saving Private Ryan now and experience what I experienced watching this so many times.
3140;See it now and see film at it's best.
3141;overall a good product, but nothing especially outstanding about this particular edition.
3142;There are countless of reasons that legendary director Steven Spielberg should be celebrated for.
3143;Specifically, his attention to detail for the time period in question.
3144;This film is awesome as is and Steven Spielberg paid attention to every detail to make it right.
3145;The characters were interesting and their dialogue was worth listening to from beginning to end.
3146;It may have only been a piece, that it was one heck of a piece.
3147;This film gets my full recommendation.
3148;This film shows us a slight picture of how it was.
3149;I feel that this Picture should of won the Oscar.
3150;Great film and shows a good meaning.
3151;The acting is top notch, with Oscar Worthy performance by almost the entire cast and with particularity another Great performance by Tom Hanks.
3152;Once again, the DTS version shines, as the Panzer tanks enter the town at the end of Chapter 15 and the beginning of Chapter 16.
3153;I am a true Tom Hanks fan and enjoy any movie that he is in.
3154;Great cast also, fine performance by all.
3155;I still rate Platoon for that.
3156;The movie is well done and highlights so many facets.
3157;I bought this movie for a gift for my son.
3158;All the actors are perfect.
3159;It is a must see movie.
3160;I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out in 1998.
3161;I was stunned by how realistic it was, and up to that point I had never seen anything like it.
3162;Much to the dismay of some of the reviewers here, SPR is actually.
3163;It actually has the nerve to portray American soldiers as honorable and the war as a just cause.
3164;The characters are men with flaws and weaknesses just like everyone else, and this gives the film a very realistic feel.
3165;sentimental, but as far as I'm concerned, 'Saving Private Ryan' remains THE classic war film that stands above the rest.
3166;It is a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died in WW2, period.
3167;Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there.
3168;the plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many?
3169;This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D. day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham.
3170;When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.
3171;having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie.
3172;But it was all worth it.
3173;Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American.
3174;In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda.
3175;The opening scene of Stephen Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan which depicts the Allied Forces D. day invasion of Normandy Beach is more graphic, harrowing, stunning, intense, spectacular, realistic and amazing war scene ever film.
3176;We feel as if we are plopped right in the middle of the action.
3177;The movie's ending, while not as good as the opening scene is still stunning and brilliant.
3178;Those two scenes are among the finest Mr. Spielberg has ever filmed.
3179;He is the last male member of his family and if he is killed, his family name will die with him.
3180;Mr. Hanks always adds class to anything he does and his subtle and heroic portrayal of Miller saves the middle section from sinking completely into cliche territory.
3181;It's also available at Wal.
3182;This, along with band of brothers, stands testament to the men who fought in WWII, with excellent visuals, sound, story and acting, this is one of the best movies of all times.
3183;Not a happy story, but a realistic depiction of wartime trauma.
3184;The audience will root for this platoon, and hope its mission succeeds.
3185;Saving Private Ryan is perhaps one of the my favorite movie of all times.
3186;It has great scenes, details and camera works that are just the least to the overall storyline, which makes the movie engaging from start to finish.
3187;Simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made.
3188;Not only is it one of the best artistically, but it is one of the best in terms of worthy subject matter and honorable values.
3189;the film, directed flawlessly by Steven Spielberg, is a gut.
3190;Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast of characters who get completely absorbed in their roles.
3191;Hanks should have been nominated and awarded by the Academy for his utterly convincing portrayal of Captain Miller.
3192;Perhaps the most memorable portrayal in the film is Jeremy Davis' searing role as Corporal Upham, a deeply terrorized and conflicted translator.
3193;All of the acting in this film is so good, one never thinks, Wow, that's good acting.
3194;It just feels very real.
3195;the cinematography and sound are stupendous and the sensitive score by John Williams accents, rather than overwhelms.
3196;But it's the best and most significant (at least, it's tied with SCHINDLER'S LIST for that honor).
3197;Above all, it reminds us that we exist today because of the courageous sacrifices made by others on our behalf.
3198;BEAT ME WITH A HAMMER!
3199;Take away the great visual battle scene and all you have is another formula story.
3200;Saving Private Ryan is destined to be a classic for decades to come.
3201;It is alternately compelling and disturbing, with realistic portrayals of flawed, yet realistic characters.
3202;I initially received a copy of the recalled discs and I sent it back through the great and unmatched return system that Amazon offers.
3203;In my opinion this is the first movie that brought real war action and images to the screen.
3204;It set the bar to a whole new height and challenged many film makers with the task of conveying the reality of war to their audience in a more in.
3205;Because Tom Hanks is a really great actor and this is a really good dramatic movie and a great story.
3206;This film should be seen by every American old enough to handle realistic war scenes, especially our Representatives, Senators and everyone in the administration, including the President!
3207;I promise you'll be on the edge of your chair for the entire story, and if you have surround sound, you will be flinching from the gunfire and feel as though you are on the beach.
3208;The first 20 minutes of SPR boasts the greatest peice of Cinematography ever filmed .
3209;Subsequently the movie slows down but is still good.
3210;Hands down, this is the best movie ever made.
3211;It hits as close to home as is possible with the cinema format.
3212;Tom Hanks and the supporting cast are brilliant, and the way that the movie is pieced together gives it an unparalleled flow and depth.
3213;The battle scenes have few worthy comparisons, the dialogue is substantial and meaningful, the settings are perfect, and the impact should not be lost on anyone.
3214;There are good movies, there are great movies, but only a few are the best.
3215;Love the movie and it's accompanying bonus features.
3216;Thanks to the men and women of our military.
3217;A well crafted story that illustrates the bravery, horror, valor, and sacrifice of that war.
3218;This is a great movie.
3219;this will be in the top 100 of this century.
3220;good picture sound is great everything you could ask for in a blu.
3221;I came to the conclusion that Spielberg intended to give his audience a glimpse of the horror and chaos of war.
3222;I believe that he did so, not so much to shock us, but to give us a greater appreciation of what our veterans endured in times of war (and that, in turn, IS shocking).
3223;If this movie had accomnplished nothing else, it deserves our appreciation for that one aspect.
3224;that issue aside, there is a lot more to this movie and, again, it all points towards honoring the commitment of our men in uniform.
3225;The very beginning of the movie sets us up for the idea that we are seeing this movie from the perspective of a veteran.
3226;The story evolves that a group of soldiers are asigned a special task during the D. day invasion aftermath.
3227;The movie concludes back in the present with a moving scene that shows the depth of the camaraderie of men that served in combat together.
3228;this movie boasts many things including outstanding acting and direction.
3229;The special effects, as mentioned, are outstanding.
3230;There is a message about combat that is disturbing but very honest.
3231;All these questions are thrust at us and it underscores the message of the film
3232;Watch this movie and you will be better able to appreciate the veterans in your community.
3233;The Movie sends chills down my spine.
3234;With a cast full of talented actors on the verge of breaking.
3235;while the opening sequence pulls no punches and is truly a technical achievement, it should be obvious [director] Steven Spielberg uses the heartbeat of this story to do his 'Jewish duty' and portray those nasty Germans as totally vile, even making it clear the German POW's should be shot.
3236;It is testament to Spielberg's manipulative skills that this film is as popular as it is.
3237;for a more honest approach to the horror of war, check out Apocalypse Now.
3238;Having watched more than hundreds of movies, I dare say that, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best among that.
3239;next good thing, the soundtrack by Oscar composer, John William.
3240;His music always made many of the already.
3241;for my conclusion, this is the BEST movie ever released from Steven Spielberg!
3242;So I'm glad I was among those to see it when it first came out.
3243;The characters are very interesting.
3244;Add that to the hopelessness felt by those on the beach (and the audience), and WOW.
3245;The final battle scene also had me on the edge of my seat, especially hearing the Tiger tank coming through in surround sound.
3246;saving private ryan is one of the best movies ever made.
3247;well what would your country be like if the americans didnt land on d day .
3248;In Saving Private Ryan , Spielberg paints a hauntingly painful picture of how precious every life is, and how important it is that we never forget the men and women who died for the last just war.
3249;As the World War II generation begins to pass away we are reminded at how great a sacrifice these men and women made in order for us to enjoy the freedoms we have today.
3250;The movie is cut in the mold of It's A Wonderful Life .
3251;And the message is the same from both, life is a precious gift.
3252;Both films will undoubtedly be viewed as national treasures for generations to come.
3253;i believe the Widescreen Edition is a must.
3254;I received the blue ray before I expected to!
3255;Packaged properly, and in perfect condition!
3256;One of my favorite titles.
3257;In a few words, this picture was robbed of its 1998 Oscar for best picture.
3258;It is, undoubtedly, a masterpiece of modern film, and deserves all the praise it has received.
3259;wrenching realism, or the way the film transports you back in time, but the way it leaves you feeling at the end.
3260;part of what makes the such a great war film is its brutality.
3261;The gripping battle scene in the beginning is so real that to this day my adrenaline rushes when I see it.
3262;The movie does an excellent job of making you feel a part of the conflict.
3263;Spielberg never lets your mind wander.
3264;Your eyes are glued to the screen, expecting a German to pop out of the bushes or rubble at any moment.
3265;what makes this quite possibly the greatest war film of all time is how Spielberg brings you into the mind of the characters in this movie.
3266;You see them struggle emotionally, weep, and fight for their lives, and you believe in them, because you know that there were soldiers just like this and in situations just like this in the real war.
3267;i recommend everyone see it, because it is a harsh reminder of what price was paid for our freedom, and it shows how the war was really fought.
3268;I developed a newfound respect for our veterans as a result.
3269;This is a great WWII movie and is a must have for my collection.
3270;ray fr my growing collection.
3271;He was one of the many casualties of the battle.
3272;saving Private Ryan was robbed of a well deserved Oscar, and the acclamation it deserved.
3273;unfortunatly, genocide continues, but the great war they won let this world live free.
3274;If someone knows a person who fought in WWII, shake their hand and say thank you.
3275;this movie is a living tribute to those who fought, and those who died.
3276;Tom Hanks said it best when he made the point that not one national monument stands for those who have fallen during World War Two .
3277;For now, this movie is good enough for me, but not for those KIA.
3278;It also shows what other war movies did not : the whole cruelty of the war, some scenes are so realistic in depicting battles .
3279;Just when you thought the great era of War Movies was long over, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg pull out a faith restoring movie.
3280;in the grand style we've come to expect from Spielberg, he and Tom Hanks bring forth an outstanding story.
3281;while I'm a John Wayne fan of high extreams, I'd classify Tom Hank's portraile of a WWII Captain far surpasing of even the Duke!
3282;Yes, the D. day scene is graphic and accurate.
3283;See The Longest Day for the overall story.
3284;I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who likes to collect movies!!
3285;An outstanding movie dipicting both the horrors of war and the great spirit of man.
3286;Award winning (should have)performance by Tom Hanks and great cast all around.
3287;A great movie, with alot of action.
3288;It has a lot of great stars in it and is full of action.
3289;This movie will make you mad, cry and laugh throughout the whole movie.
3290;It is so real it makes you think you are there and you feel what it may have been like to be on that beach in normandy.
3291;The scenery was excellent and the writing and acting was very exceptional.
3292;Tom Hanks was not a choice I would have made for the lead but he did a outstanding job in the role he played.
3293;It is a great history telling movie about our country and what it has gone through in one of the wars of our times.
3294;I strongly recommend this picture.
3295;The action in this moive is so strong that you feel as though you are right there with the troops fighting every step of the way.
3296;o. k. it was a great movie, i'll give you that.
3297;The acting was outstanding, the story well.
3298;We did discuss it afterwards and it prompted many good questions on their part, so I'm hopeful that the experience of seeing this movie was beneficial to them.
3299;Terrific action, acting, realistic scenes, like being there in person.
3300;This is a great picture regarding D. day and the initial invasion of Normandy and its march into Germany.
3301;This film had good cinematography.
3302;Want a brutal, intense, horribly true.
3303;Get Come and See .
3304;Saving Private Ryan ranks right up there with Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers, though We Were Soldiers was very powerful emotionally.
3305;Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were great in this movie.
3306;A good look at the battle of Normandy Invasion, the sacrifices of soldiers and realistic survival of brave soldiers.
3307;It's historic and valuable keepsake.
3308;stark and raw, this film is, but what makes it superb are those personal moments.
3309;The movie is one of the best war movies made.
3310;And a clear picture beauiful color.
3311;One of my top 10 movies of all time!
3312;What i see in daily normal life is enough.
3313;War films are fine without getting the audience worked up and basically sick from some of the sights in this film.
3314;I go to movies for one reason, to escape the daily life of realizm, the struggles, the hardships, this screwed up country and i go to be entertained.
3315;The key word here is entertain.
3316;I am sure you have heard quite a bit about this movie already and I need not reiterate that, but I will share a few thoughts.
3317;The battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite elaborate in detail.
3318;The story line is a good one, though not true, it does remind you of the true story of the Sullivan brothers (five brothers who were killed while serving on the same navy ship in WWII).
3319;it was a great movie and definitely worth seeing.
3320;Spielberg and company have created a new, elusive standard for all combat films to follow.
3321;I hope it indeed sets a precedent.
3322;What makes this film so good?
3323;It shows what happens to a small band of men united by a caring captain, superbly played by Hanks, who become heroes even though they remain reluctant warriors.
3324;It is fitting and altogether uplifting that their leader is a former schoolteacher.
3325;My father once reminded me that a true hero seldom if ever finds the need to talk about his exploits.
3326;That is certainly true of Captain John Miller and Private Ryan in this film.
3327;Yes, the first half hour is visceral and shocking, leaving nothing to fancy, but it is ungratuitous violence coupled with soul.
3328;One of my picks for top ten films of the past century.
3329;Excellent dramatization of our finest generation, and the horror of the invasion of Normandy.
3330;Good cast, well acted, intense visuals.
3331;My father was in VietNam and he said this is the most accurate representation of combat he has ever seen.
3332;For him this film brought back nightmares he hasn't had in 20 years but, he believes this film shows the honor of the doing the right thing at the right time.
3333;In the perverse world of war there is true honor and heroism.
3334;Private Ryan displays good vs. evil at it's best.
3335;Great story, I love our troops!
3336;Thank God for all our brave men and women!
3337;Everyone should see this movie.
3338;the D. day invasion scene was very detailed and absolutely amazing.
3339;Plus Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors.
3340;The most powerful film of the decade.
3341;True, it had some of the most powerful action sequences ever put to film.
3342;This is pure Hollywood fantasy.
3343;Director Steven Spielberg continues to make movie magic with the breathtaking war drama Saving Private Ryan.
3344;After the historic D. day invasion, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men embark across enemy lines to find Private James Ryan who's awarded a return trip home after news that his three brothers have been killed in combat.
3345;Saving Private Ryan is an astonishing, edge.
3346;seat war spectacle of courage and triumph over incredible odds.
3347;Director Steven Spielberg combines amazing visual images and powerful human emotions to create such a moving masterpiece.
3348;Saving Private Ryan includes fine performance by Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore and Tom Hanks in another award.
3349;Its visual effects, thrilling action sequences and realistic backgrounds elevate the film's excitement and sheer intensity.
3350;The 1998 war drama opens with a breathtaking recreation of D. day that could best be described as the most realistic and stunning war sequence in film history.
3351;Saving Private Ryan won five Academy Awards and inspired the award.
3352;winning television miniseries Band of Brothers.
3353;The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound delivers a powerful home theater experience.
3354;star, Tom Hanks, to play the lead role, then he gets teen.
3355;I know some D. day veterans have said Spielberg got it right, yet others were less sure suggesting nothing could portray the horror and tragedy of those events in June 1944.
3356;Similar to his Schindler's List, Spielberg uses some of the attributes of documentary to tell his story and for this, the film's five Academy awards are well won.
3357;The jerky camera shot, the immensely telling sound and special visual effects, the snappy editing place us in the action.
3358;with Spielberg shocking and provoking us, his third task was to haunt us.
3359;The movie's memorable opening and closing scenes will always linger in our thoughts.
3360;Spielberg's genius is that he has left us with a joltingly fresh reminder of war and it terrors.
3361;One of my favorite movies.
3362;Saving Private Ryan is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made!
3363;Steven Spielberg has given the veterans of WWII a fine tribute, in his best film.
3364;SPR offers honor and invokes patroitism.)
3365;The movie opens with an amazing reenactment of the historic D. day invasion.
3366;minute sequence is the most violent, graphic, gory, and gutwrenching scene in the history of film, but it is also one of the best filmed sequences ever made.
3367;(Janusz Kaminski deserved the Oscar for his breathtaking cinematography.)
3368;As the landing crafts reach the beach, we are introduced to Captain John Miller(played brillantly by Tom Hanks), a man who is determined to lead his soldiers into battle, but also goes into a brief state of shock every once in a while.
3369;Three of the Ryan brothers were killed in combat, but there is still one brother, Private James Ryan, who is alive.
3370;Spielberg deserved his 2nd Best Director Oscar for this fine movie.
3371;Tom Hanks gives the best performance of his career(besides Philadelphia), showing his humanity in the middle of the tragedy known as war.
3372;This should have won Best Picture instead of Shakespeare in Love, but that doesn't matter.
3373;What someone will take with them after this movie is a true understanding of the sacrifice that these men made to protect our freedom.
3374;It is also technically and somewhat artistically well beyond what most War movies have done before.
3375;That is, the story and characters are developed not from a Veteran's standpoint, but from a novice trying to imagine a Veteran's standpoint.
3376;If they had been carrying plastic toy guns, I would have found the tone more honest.
3377;But for a really good recent war movie I'll take Windtalkers or Blackhawk Down.
3378;Saving Private Ryan is a historic epic by Steven Speilberg paying tribute to those who participated in D. day.
3379;With excellent cinemotography and sound editing, it was one of the most realistic portrayals of D. day to date.
3380;A stellar cast led by Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, it's told through the eyes of those on a special misssion to bring a last living son home to his family during history's greatest invasion.
3381;Steven Speilberg out did himself on this one, and it's a great tribute to those fighting men who made our freedom possible.
3382;As archetypal heroes, they are portrayed as successful killers.
3383;This soldier's talent for killing is portrayed as unreflectively admirable .
3384;If we enjoy, even empathise, with his precision as a marksman, how is this 'anti.
3385;*There is, of course, the sentimental core of the film, the actual saving of Private Ryan.
3386;Perhaps this explains the presence of Ryan's family in the opening and closing graveyard scenes .
3387;Clearly worth the academy awards it received.
3388;One of the greatest movies of Human Struggle ever made.
3389;This is a great movie that will break your heart this is what happens to good men and good women who put their lives on the line for our great nation this is a damn good movie
3390;Saving Private Ryan was one of the most neccesary films that has ever been made.
3391;It is the harrowing story of a squad of men led by John H. Miller {Hanks}, and captures the very gritty realities of war.
3392;Spielberg also made Band of Brothers which is also an amazing story of heroism and sacrifice renowned the world over.
3393;No doubt in my mind that these works that Steven Spielberg has masterfully created will live on through the generations as some of the greatest war epics ever depicted on film.
3394;The Blu Ray has a very sharp, detailed film like look to it (thankfully, no blurring away of film grain with DNR nonsense).
3395;child brings us his bizarre take on World War 2 and its not pretty.
3396;And boy those Germans are some real cut ups.
3397;He deserves a real pat on the back.
3398;Saving Private Ryan is one of those movies that stands the test of time.
3399;There are points in the picture that you will take with you and never forget.
3400;This is a fine war picture.
3401;I especially love its subtle moments of homage to the classic TV series, Combat!
3402;The extra features are very nice, too.
3403;I recommend this for anyone who cares to look at war through a reality lens.
3404;According to veterans of D. day, this is one of very few films which come about as close as possible to portraying what it is like to be there.
3405;As the search proceeds, Miller does his best to maintain the group's morale.
3406;He has his orders and is determined to follow them.
3407;It is important to keep in mind that Miller and his men have a special mission which is, in certain respects, is even more perilous because they face the same stiff resistance other Allied forces do but cannot be distracted from reaching their ultimate objective which is to find a human needle within the invasion haystack.
3408;Much as I admire Shakespeare in Love, I remain convinced that Saving Private Ryan should have received another Oscar as best film.
3409;Obviously, heroic efforts to save Ryan provide the primary plot.
3410;We love and respect our soldiers because of how bad it is.
3411;This film does a great job highlighting both the glory of our accomplishments in the European theater, and the horrors of those who accomplished it.
3412;Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D. day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail.
3413;For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach.
3414;deafening explosions.You really got a sense of what these guys had to go through.
3415;throughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing.
3416;For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer.
3417;It's one of the most intimate.
3418;hand combat with the American soldier.
3419;Good movie now even better on blu.
3420;This Movie is definitely a classic!
3421;This is a world war 2 movie that wasvery well done by Director Steven Spielberg.
3422;All I knew was Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, war movie , so I figured would be good.
3423;the war footage is so incredibly realistic that I was begging for relief.
3424;the second most disturbing sequence in the film is an extended sequence of hand.
3425;hand combat from a unexpected character.
3426;if that was it, the film would be dismissible, but the battle scenes frame what gives the watcher a true sense of what it means to be a soldier.
3427;The characters are are written and performed very realistically, as well.
3428;i don't now if saying I enjoyed the film would be a good way to explain my reaction, but it is excellent.
3429;A masterpiece that totally achieves what Spielberg intended it to.
3430;He and Tom Hanks, who plays the Captain of the squad that is assigned to retrieve Private Ryan, really should have won Oscars that year.
3431;He'll have a much better idea of what he's getting into.
3432;Being young and full of ambition, I thought Steven Spielberg at the time was the world's best director and was flawless with his directing skills (Of course, I hadn't seen his dumb parody, 1941).
3433;It was probably the most realistic and emotional war film I've ever seen since his work with Schiendler's List.
3434;A small group of American soldiers, very young and scared, ride in the ajacent Higgins Boat across the French channel.
3435;american Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and probably the most memorable character, the under trained, yet sweet Cororal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davis) as the company's translator.
3436;I was astounded and shocked at the D. day beach storming sequence of the film.
3437;Two things prevent me from giving this otherwise great movie five stars.
3438;Otherwise, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands out as one of the best movies of its genre.
3439;(The film's extraordinary battle sequences will be talked about for years, and have already influenced several directors.)
3440;And we DO have to remember the bravery and heroism of the American soldiers who fought in that most violent of conflicts.
3441;This is a great presentation of the D. day landings and subsequent actions.
3442;ray makes it even better.
3443;Great research was done on the landings and are very accurate.
3444;Tom Hanks and all the others in the squad are great actors (even the little coward).
3445;Thanks Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hanks for a great movie.
3446;Saving Private Ryan is a fabulous and acurate war drama brimming with action and suspense.
3447;Great movie, but several minutes are marred by some digital glitch that blurs the picture.
3448;This is a very good movie.
3449;it opens with the best combat scene ever filmed for a movie.
3450;The initial combat scene is incredibly realistic, moving, and bloody.
3451;the acting is very good.
3452;The supporting cast turns in fine performances as well.
3453;This movie continues it, although not as severely as Dances.
3454;this is a fine movie, worth owning and watching.
3455;While it is not the best war movie ever made, it is a very good one.
3456;The opening D. day scene on Omahu Beach is terrific, it leaves you shacking almost!
3457;In a way its a tribute to the genre I suppose.
3458;The opening and closing scenes with Ryan and his family years later is a tear.
3459;The final battle at the bridge, while exciting, is fantastic.
3460;Otherwsie, a decent film overall despite these flaws.
3461;This movie was a good see in general, bringing the horrors of war on screen in a moving experience.
3462;So much praise has been heaped upon Saving Private Ryan, I feel compelled to meekly point out that Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, stirring as it is, really isnt quite the unqualified masterpiece its made out to be.
3463;hour movie to follow, and rarely is it as gripping or effective as its prologue.
3464;Aside from Spielbergs excellent direction, all credit is due to the fine cast.
3465;worthy role, the man surprises you.
3466;hes never shown deeper range, subtlety, or quiet intensity than he does as Captain John Miller.
3467;Im talking about an early moment in the film, when the gentle pitter.
3468;the most penetrating and lyrical image in the entire movie.
3469;where Ryan stumbles is where so many grand epic.
3470;His film is pointed and emotional enough without having to resort to a device like that.
3471;The Academy was right to name Spielberg the best director, but they were even more right to name Shakespeare in Love the better movie.
3472;As a tribute to the men who gave up their lives on the battlefield, Saving Private Ryan is an admirable and important film.
3473;As a cinematic achievement, it must be held to a higher standard.
3474;Near the end when Upham finally captures those Germans and shoots the one they let go.
3475;Great special effects and acting, excellent movie.
3476;The first scenes of Saving Private Ryan are spectacular.
3477;You are with the landing force as it hits the beach at Normandy.
3478;Skull Rack and Hummingbird God.
3479;my father which was on the first wave of Omaha Beach had also seen the movie and he was deeply moved.
3480;He is still alive at 86 years old.
3481;got up to leave while the credits were rolling!
3482;this should tell you something about Saving Private Ryan.
3483;This is probably the best movie I have ever seen.
3484;Excellent cast, crew, and effects.
3485;Spielberg delivers one of his best pictures ever.
3486;The cinematography, sound design and script are outstanding and his Best Director Academy is well earned.
3487;i bet if you surveyed some veterans of World War II, (or any war, for that matter) most would be grateful their families and loved ones did not have to see the awful sights they'd seen.
3488;saving Private Ryan was no masterpiece.
3489;as for the movie well Steven has done his powerful and engrossing masterpeice.
3490;because no matter how you see Pvt. ryan it will always grip you the last memerable film of the last decade and the century.
3491;this movie will give you that feeling.
3492;an incredible and truly epic film and the best War movie ever made.
3493;Tom Hanks is the best.
3494;There are a ton of actors that I now recognize that have made it which makes it pretty interesting also.
3495;Speilberg deserves kudos for the stunning and moving Schindler's List, that films is his greatest masterpiece and by far out shines SPR in every criterior.
3496;what proceeds after these landing scences is a sentimental and simple story.
3497;Really the whole this time the mission is a man.
3498;for a real idea of the D. day landings watch the Longest Day, it is far superior and shows all sides in accurate detail.
3499;I mean Black Hawk Down is 100% genuine and has F/X technically superior to Ryan'S but that was no where near as successfull at the box office.
3500;Most highly recommend for 5.1 home theatre owner!
3501;After that, the action drags at times, but this remains one of my favorite movies.
3502;Great interaction between Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore, and a great performance by Barry Pepper as the pios Southern sniper.
3503;Saving Private Ryan is well structured
3504;Putting that aside, it is a film that entertains
3505;mr. Spielberg has given us another of his master.
3506;best of all it is entertainment at its best
3507;This Special Edition contains enough extra material to support all of the above.
3508;This is one of the greatest stories ever told.
3509;If your interested in military movies this one is a must.
3510;The reason Spielberg is a master is because he doen't have to 'Spike Lee' his movies to nail a hidden message or theme through the viewers.
3511;Sent the second one back as well.
3512;ray because it is one of my favorite movies, but if they can't convert it to Blu.
3513;I must say im only 15 but i was deeply moved by the movie.
3514;It is truly the best war movie ever.
3515;ray copy of this movie and I knew just how great the movie was but the Blu.
3516;i would recommend it to anyone.
3517;I have a love of history and have read hundreds of books on the American Revolution, The war with Mexico, the Civil War, the Indian wars and World War 1 and 2, all of them fought by brave American ready to give their life for home and country.
3518;They represented the kind of people our founding fathers envisioned when setting up this great nation.
3519;For those of you who fit this description and own a dts.
3520;Get it and enjoy, this is Spielberg's most impressive masterpiece till now, and let's hope there will be more dts discs soon.
3521;well, there are movies that do that.
3522;after Miller speaks with the hearing.
3523;wounded soldier about Ryan's location, he gets the squad together to check a map.
3524;The background music arrives at just the right time.
3525;meanwhile, the 101st continues to move on past.
3526;This movie was one of the top ten films ever made.
3527;Most certainly it was one of the best war movies ever made.
3528;The cinematography (which thankfully won an Oscar) is superb, putting the audience right in the action.
3529;This did the job of a movie to a T, immersing the audience vividly and without mercy.
3530;This is a great companion piece to Schindler's List.
3531;The picture is much, much clearer and more detailed that it's almost hard to believe it when seeing it.
3532;This movie is a very touching, very real story of war.
3533;It's sickening, it's gruesome and it's real.
3534;the cinematography in the film is very well done.
3535;held cameras and a special wash used during the processing of the film to flatten out the colors add a special touch, much like Spielberg's use of black and white in Schindler's List.
3536;existent, which underscores the intensity of the action.
3537;hanks gives a great performance, although his character isn't as well developed as I would have liked.
3538;Several good performances were given by Jeremy Davies as the interpreter and Giovanni Ribisi as Wade.
3539;Spielberg wanted to show the effects of the war on the men, and it comes out in Davies' character, and to a lesser extent Hanks' character.
3540;i saw this movie on opening day, and from start to finish I found it very compelling.
3541;But the moment that solidified this film in my mind as a great achievement came when the movie ended.
3542;It's a very powerful, emotional, movie that does what every great movie should do: makes you feel.
3543;nothing less than a perfect release from the sapphire series which is becoming one of most consistent series in blu format with the exception of gladiator.
3544;One of the greatest blu.
3545;This is defiantely one of Spieldberg's greatest achievments.
3546;He truely captures the horror of D. day and past events of WWII.
3547;The performances, especially Mat Damon's and Tom Hanks are brilliant.
3548;This film has it all.
3549;i think this is the most moving picture I have ever seen.
3550;just writing this review brings tears to my eyes.
3551;I thank men like him for saving the world for us.
3552;Detailed, vividly graphic leaving nothing to the imagination.
3553;a great movie on a simple mission to save Ryan!
3554;The order went through smoothly and I received the product .
3555;Very good movie, loved it and Tom Hanks is one of the best actors ever.
3556;up the torch and keep the freedom vibrant and flying.
3557;wide scale like the greatest generation was?
3558;See to it that if such a challenge comes before you in the future that you are a good human being before you are a good facilitator of totalitareanism.
3559;Deal?The point of SPR is that our military has to be ready to fight and win with superior ground dominance.
3560;never an ideal choice .
3561;If we don't want to be forced to having to make sticky bombs we had best re.
3562;Like young Private Ryan, please go make yourself useful in this fight, and EARN THIS freedom we enjoy.
3563;As for the historical and theatrical events, Spielberg outdid himself.
3564;This movie was by far amazing.
3565;While watching the first 30 minutes of the landing at Omaha Beach I was riveted to my seat and awestruck by the details.
3566;Makes me feel very proud for those who served in the military.
3567;This movie is one of Spielberg's best!
3568;Great story, great cinematography, great movie.
3569;The opening 1/2 hour may be one of the most realistic battles scenes ever filmed.
3570;Add to it a well written script with fine acting all around and this is a real winner.
3571;This is arguably one of the best films Steven Spielberg has ever done .
3572;as well as one of the best war films ever put on celluloid.
3573;This is Tom Hanks' most moving performance.
3574;It's a very emotional film, with Matt Da.
3575;son, the sniper, Vin Diesel Private Adrian Caparzo and loads of other good actors.
3576;Janusz Zygmunt Kaminski is a wonderful cinematographer.
3577;Steven Spielberg serves as both director and producer.
3578;There is a wonderful screenplay by Robert Rodat.
3579;John Williams Junior writes a wonderful score.
3580;Michael Kahn does some wonderful editing.
3581;Denise Chaiman makes some wonder.
3582;Thomas E. Tom Sanders makes some wonderful sets.
3583;Everyone gets their due credit here, for they've done a spectacular job of bringing horrifying images to the screen.
3584;They've done some magnificent action sequences, won.
3585;derful special effects, and so forth.
3586;I'm a devout Spielberg fan.
3587;Come athelas!Life to the dyingIn the king's hand lying!
3588;Saving Private Ryan was an instant classic and most definitely holds up 13 years later.
3589;ray looks and sounds brilliant.
3590;This is an amazing movie.
3591;Definitely a movie to own.
3592;the film was brilliantly acted as well as beautifully shot.
3593;level performance, and his supporting cast did at least as well as he did.
3594;It will make you take more time and give more love to yours and your community.
3595;I cared deeply about every single guy, I felt everything they did, albeit from the comfort of my home, and I was totally transfixed all the way through and riveted at the end.
3596;i was worn out, exhausted from my emotions, and imbued with a new respect and awe at what these young guys went through.
3597;this man knows how to tell a story.
3598;He has skills beyond those of other directors and he is unparalleled at directing movies of this scope.
3599;a cinematic masterpiece and one that will affect many more generations yet to come.
3600;That is the legacy
3601;The film is very grafic and exceeds the viewers expectations.
3602;And to a greater or lesser degree that is true.
3603;saving Private Ryan is about finding Private Ryan and getting him home, because his other brothers have all been killed.
3604;In an unusual humanitarian move, the Army brass decided to pluck Ryan from the European theater and bring him home.
3605;These guys all worked together, slept together and killed together.
3606;It was quite a testament to not just thinking about war as a nebulous thing and actually being there and even having a gun in your hand and being face to face with the enemy.
3607;By far one of the best I have ever seen.
3608;This movie gives you a true understanding of WWII and the begining scene at the Normandy landing.
3609;This movie shows that Americans never give up.
3610;And this movie makes you have pride in America and those brave men who sacrificed their lives not only for their Country but Mankind as well.
3611;well, enough with the details of the movie let's get to the plot.
3612;by the way, If you are a WWII fan like me you will love this
3613;It is a reminder that good people gave their lives so that we could have what we have today.
3614;This movie is as close as you can get to a perfect war movie.
3615;By far the best WAR FILM to date!
3616;By far the best war movie ever made, and besides Braveheart its the best movie ever.
3617;This is a perfect description of war and the men in them.
3618;The battle scenes are excellent and very realistically done, they are intense and graphic, just like the real thing.
3619;The story is truly honorable, and dramatic.
3620;The performances are great by most of the actors.
3621;This is the movie that will shock you and you will remember this movie for a long time.
3622;Great acting, great music, great sound, great action, and it is the best movie ever made.
3623;I would recommend this movie to people over 14 years of age, who likes Spielberg films, and who likes to watch war films.
3624;After you watch the movie, you have to clap and cheer at the end.
3625;This is one of those films you have to see.
3626;This movie will make you laugh and cry, but most of all it will make you think.
3627;This may only be a movie but it darn sure makes one appreciate what has been given to us by all the veterans that have came before us.
3628;But during the 20 minutes of the Omaha Beach landing scenes, all the tears welled up into my eyes.
3629;Being in combat myself, I was amazed at how real Spielberg made it look.
3630;It's as real as it can get.
3631;If you haven't seen it yet, go see it now!
3632;Excellent movie, plus lots of additional footage and shorts about the making of the movie.
3633;Well cast, great story, we love Tom Hanks and others in the cast
3634;The portrait, the story, the acting, everything is brilliant.
3635;Everything is just so real.
3636;Saving Private Ryan is an amazing movie, one of the few that can make a man a little emotional.
3637;The cast is amazing, and even if your not a War movie fan, i think its a movie anyone who appreciates a greatly thought out and well casted movie can enjoy.
3638;Who knows, you may find yourself a little sad at the end and yet extremely happy you bought this great movie!
3639;Brings tears to my eyes, every time I see this movie.
3640;This may not be Spielberg's best drama(that is Schinder's List),but is truly one of his best.
3641;while it is extremley violent(the D. day scene is truly a good example of this),it is stiil a powerful film that is filled with some terrific performances(especially from Tom Hanks,Matt Damon,and Jeremy Davies)and one powerful ending.
3642;all in all,one of the best films of its kind.
3643;After completing this movie, Spielberg and Hanks could comfortably state to the world that their best work was probably behind them.
3644;i have never seen a movie that was so powerful that I shook throughout the entire viewing.
3645;and that's really all I have to say.
3646;This can never be among my favorite movies, but my respect for it is unrivaled.
3647;It is truly one of the best war movies I have ever seen.
3648;He takes the pick of the little from his squad and sets out to find Private Ryan, along the way we watch the men form 'bonds of brotherhood' with one another, and we also watch two of the most beloved men die.
3649;this movie is truly incrddible.
3650;This is the opening to one of the greatest war movies I have ever seen.
3651;The whole story is amazingly written and is suggested to anyone who wants to see what war really has to offer.
3652;This is a very excellent movie and I would suggest it to anyone willing to see the blood.
3653;wrenching, beautiful and terrifying movie teaches us.
3654;Be a better person
3655;Also if you are really into sound like me then you have got to compare the two for yourself and you will hear the difference.
3656;The characters are memorable, the cinematography is amazing, the direction is right on, and the actor's all deliver with performances that are nothing short of perfect.
3657;first let's talk about the cinematography.
3658;The shots are all reminiscent of Life Magazine and the original images of the invasion.
3659;Spielberg, ever the perfectionist, and his cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski) use a first person perspective of shaky camera's to put the viewer right in the middle of the battle.
3660;the script itself was a wonderful story.
3661;The idea that you would risk a few to bring out one man because he is the last of four children is powerful.
3662;The writers certainly captured the spirit of what is being called The Greatest Generation.
3663;As for the actors, well, they were amazing.
3664;Tom Hanks is certainly the best actor of this time period and he proves it with this performance.
3665;Tom Sizemore is excellent as the competent and battle hardened sergeant.
3666;Best war movie i have ever seen.
3667;Full Metal Jacket was my best.
3668;it is five stars easy.
3669;As time passes and survivors of D. day and WWII pass away, an incredible living testimony of the realities of war and the true meaning of patriotism will pass with those brave men and women who laid their lives on the line overseas fighting for democracy and for our freedom.
3670;This film focuses oneone story revolving around D. day, but it gives you a glimpse into the grueling realities of any war.
3671;this movie brings you right into the battle.
3672;scenes footage, interviews with Steven Speilberg, cast and film.
3673;A lot of folks feel that this may be the one of the best WWII films ever.
3674;I agree that it may be the one of the best to date in the technical sense, using up.
3675;date, groundbreaking film and audio techniques to really entrench you in the battle scenes.
3676;And I agree that the first war scene on Omaha Beach on D. day was extremely effective and emotional, capturing the utter frustration, fear and horror of the men involved.
3677;And I think the casting was great and the acting was well done.
3678;I knew it was just a movie.
3679;It did keep my attention the entire time and I did enjoy it if it is okay to say that.
3680;Great special effects, great story line, plenty of action and authentic uniforms and weapons consistent with era and time frame of WWII.
3681;hour of this movie is the most realistic and intense battle footage ever filmed, as well as a sobering reminder of the price paid for freedom.
3682;the action is nicely interspersed throughout the film, and its easy to forget Hanks normal cheesey roles.
3683;the cast is great the action is amazing, the battle scene at the end must be second to none.
3684;This movie is in my opinion the best World War 2 movie that has came out to this day.
3685;The acting is superb, and the story will make any grown man cry.
3686;This is quite simply one of the best movies ever made.
3687;i'm talking top 5 of all time level of great.
3688;the way the movie captures every level of bravery, from the guys who storm the beach with piss and vinegar to the guys who barely make it off the landing boats before breaking down in tears.
3689;it shows you every angle of humanity.
3690;it's an emotional story that will captivate you from so many angles.
3691;And it just so well made that it completely immerses you into 1944 France.
3692;This film will always be remembered as the best war movie of the 1990's.
3693;It gets tight to the bone about the horrors of war.
3694;The only other movies that fullfills this mission besides Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and even some parts of Enemy at the Gates.
3695;I found the way in which Miller balances taking care of his soldiers and carrying out the mission was very tough and brutal to his own psyche.
3696;Miller has to deal with the conflict between carrying out the mission and taking care of the soldiers, and he reveals how he does this to his sergeant.
3697;captain Miller is obviously affected by the stress and horror of war, but he still is able to effectively lead.
3698;Knowing how soldiers act, I felt the movie was very realistic in the portrayal of the enlistedmen and the sergeant, played by Tom Sizemore.
3699;I felt a great gratitude to the soldiers that died on D. day.
3700;This movie will give you a strong sense of admiration for those that served the United States in World War II, especially on the crucial D. day.
3701;From hearing the historian Stephen Ambrose's remarks of how D. day was like for the common soldier, this movie gives the most gritty look at what combat may have been like for the soldier on D. day.
3702;This is probably the best World War II movie I have ever seen.
3703;The emotions and acting in this movie just made my jaw drop.
3704;Saw it in the theater and a couple times on HBO.
3705;A great war story on the invasion of Normandy in June of 1944.
3706;Although a fictional story, it is a composite of true stories.
3707;The history, the action, the language is all accurate and very very well filmed!
3708;I absolutely love this movie.
3709;Tom Hanks is such an awesome actor.
3710;Speilberg knows how to make war movies.
3711;Witness his excellent TV series Band of Brothers , and the even better The Pacific .
3712;This film is the winner of five Academy Awards and deservedly so.
3713;If you like war movies you will love this one.
3714;It is a well acted and action filled film about men sent to do a very dangerous job and questioning the rationale behind it.
3715;Hanks is his usual everyman best and the supporting cast is top notch.
3716;This classi demands the best possible presentation, for anyone who has it, or has seen it in any other format.
3717;Technically, the visuals are very good and the sound work is simply breathtaking, definitely essential to listen in DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1.
3718;Saving Private Ryan is probably the best and most powerful war film, not because of its plot or actors, but simply because it's honest most of the time, showing us the true face of death, blood, and suffering.
3719;The most realistic no holds barred depiction of war and death ever to hit the movie screens.
3720;This was an impressing film, esp.
3721;As war films go, this has got to be one of the best.
3722;Its battle scenes are realistically frightening, and will make a pacifist out of anyone for at least a few hours afterward.
3723;My only complaint is that the first 15 minutes make you believe that the entire movie will continue to be a war movie.
3724;As far as the rest of the film goes, the character's stories are believable and compelling, except for (ironically) Ryan himself but I wish the film was able to retain the same intensity as when it began.
3725;together piece of filmmaking that will certainly change your views about WW2 war in general.
3726;Never before has a movie affected me so deeply, and I believe Spielberg was deprived of the credit he deserved for this spectacular piece of filmmaking.
3727;My family has not seen this movie so bought to add to our collection and share this amazing film with them.
3728;which makes it an influential and therefore important film.
3729;which is consistent with their silence about the war in everyday life.
3730;with regards to the third observation, I believe Steven Spielberg has succeeded in accomplishing what he set out to do.
3731;to any and all Veterans.you have my thanks and gratitude.
3732;i for one am grateful to receive the reminder and thank god for people like my father who helped save the world I have the good fortune to live in today.
3733;I was very impressed by ths film.
3734;well, I served in the British Army Reserves for four years and my platoon had a fierce Scot, joking Londoner, smiling Irishman and philosphical Welshman in it, plus me as the token University Boy so I think you'll find that real.
3735;life Army units can be like that.
3736;not the sort of battle that can be won in an afternoon I'm sure you'll agree.
3737;the most realistic combat scenes you will ever see on celluloid by far, and the plot is at least believable.
3738;by the way, thanks very much to the US armed forces for doing a fantastic job as our allies in WW2, and other times.
3739;2) This sequence has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie!
3740;most of you complained about the inaccuracy.
3741;In my opinion, this movie was made beautifully.
3742;The action scenes were amazing.
3743;The dialogue was very realistic and made you give a damn about the soldiers.
3744;the actors were very genuine and played their roles perfectly.
3745;Scenery, uniforms, staging, landscapes, set decorations were fantastic.
3746;Extras were also enjoyable and well thought out.
3747;This movie is one of Spielberg's best WW2 movies.
3748;It's graphic and really shows you how the war was fought.
3749;I'm a HUGE fan of the WW's, and I have to say this movie is one of the best.
3750;Movie is outstanding ,now i have the steelbook ,fast shippping as well thanks again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3751;While I thought the original was excellent and with DTS audio, it should be, the Blu Ray is a worthy addition to your collection.
3752;The Sapphire version is certainly its equal and may be superior.
3753;It is rare , in my experience, that the original is as excellent as it is, but if you already have that, than I really wouldn't say that going to this blu ray is a must have.
3754;you have to see it.
3755;Great graphics, realism and plot.
3756;A must see for everyone.
3757;Give the public a choice.
3758;This film has to be the most moving one that I have ever seen.
3759;Tom Hanks gives a wonderful performance in a wonderful film by Steven Speilberg.
3760;Spielberg amazingly directed the best movie I have ever seen, not to mention of 1998.
3761;The realism reaches out and bites you, and for once the violence is not needless, it is important to each and every American.
3762;My dad and I left the movie theatre with a greater sense of patriotism.
3763;This is, by far, the best film Steven Spielberg has directed.
3764;The last two hours, including the final fight scene, were truly some of Spielberg's best moments ever captured on film.
3765;But, beyond that, is a moving story with characters who were fighting to save ONE man.
3766;This will remain one of my ten favorite films of all time.
3767;This movie is so awesome, so well done.
3768;If you enjoyed the movie when it came out, you'll enjoy seeing it on Blu.
3769;Spielberg did an excelent job once again.
3770;Definatly worth seing at least once.
3771;The best thing about this movie is that it was educational.
3772;I actually came away having greater appreciation for WW2 vets and what they had to go through.
3773;The footage of Spielberg's first war movies was definitely an eye opener.
3774;He was able to create a pretty good movie with little more than his own ingenuity and his Dad's old camera.
3775;One can really feel the passion Spielberg puts forth from his own knowledge and memories of the war.
3776;Saving Private Ryan was gold, Steven Spielberg's best work ever.
3777;One of the top ten movies of all time .
3778;But a must see movie !
3779;This is an incredible movie with an excellent story line complimented with top notch visual and sound effects.
3780;I'm sure the number will increase in the future, especially if they sound like this movie.
3781;Talk about feeling you were right there!
3782;The film depicts the incredible heroism of the men on the beach who were faced with nearly insurmountable conditions.
3783;Yet these soldiers will carry these memories the rest of their lives.
3784;Saving Private Ryan , along with Schindler's List , is my personal favorite movie from director Steven Spielberg.
3785;minute D. day sequence is one of moviedom's most memorable and realistic scenes ever.
3786;Tom Hanks gave, in my opinion, the best performance of his career as Captain John H. Miller.
3787;The screenplay is what I like best about this movie.
3788;The images in both films linger on in my memory.
3789;This movie is a true master piece.
3790;Can I give it 6 stars.
3791;Everything about this movie is compelling.
3792;It starts off like a sledgehammer with the D. day invasion itself in one of the most startling, riveting and shocking scenes in movie history.
3793;And even though the rest of the movie cannot match that one scene in sheer intensity, it is still superb.You find yourself totally immersed in the characters and the dilemna that the film deals with.
3794;adding to the intensity of the experience is the beautiful score by John Williams and the power of the sounds of war.
3795;If you want to see a movie about D. day and all that went into it, see The Longest Day.
3796;Saving Private Ryan is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war.
3797;The Controlling Idea, that brotherhood is worth dying for, is well told and thematically supported.
3798;The hope is the survivors (and the viewers) can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect.
3799;great film told with what I count to be three major external plots: to save Ryan, to win the war and to save the lives of the men.
3800;The brothers are good from beginning to end and their relationships are good from beginning to end.
3801;I'm 19 years old, and most would classify my generation as cynical.
3802;In this age of computers and frenzied pace, this movie is an excellent way to keep you grounded.
3803;At the end I was crying that is how good this movie is.
3804;ONE OF THE best War 11 Movies .
3805;Very good Picture and sound qualit
3806;Spielberg truly plunges you into battle, taking you right there beside them, with awesome sound and expert cinematography.
3807;I especially enjoyed the calm whitenesses that Captain Miller experiences twice, as time slows down as he watches the chaos around him.
3808;I haven't seen enough WWII movies to make much comparison, but this one is filled with enough characterization, a cohesive plot to keep interest, and gripping action to keep one entertained.
3809;And finally, Spielberg answers the age.
3810;God Bless those who gave their lives for what millions around the world enjoy today.
3811;This was a pretty fun action movie, but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark.
3812;Spielberg has done much better.
3813;The process was fast and efficient.
3814;Great story and history was more than accurate.
3815;I was deeply impressed and moved by it.
3816;the film gives you a very authentic feel.
3817;most real looking battle I have ever seen.
3818;First of all I`m a massive Hanks fan and I think this film reflects his true acting ability.
3819;This film touched my heart like no other simply because of the way Spielberg portrayed his characters.
3820;It is the kind of film that I could not stop thinking about hours, even days after I first witnessed this true masterpiece.
3821;A true reflection of the films depth is the beach massacre at the begining of the film, and how they managed to sustain the high level of realism and entertainment throughout was incredible.
3822;This film is a must, it changed my perception of true film making.
3823;Awesome, the service was fast, and exactly how the product was described to be.
3824;The movie is very awesome by the way.
3825;It gets right to the heart of the horror of war and never lets up.
3826;It is a wake up call.
3827;It is also about rising above adversity triumphantly, adversity in many forms.
3828;With its touch of Hollywood heroics, it is also classic Americana.
3829;i notice some Amazon reviewers denigrate the film with their griping and nitpicking.
3830;OK, so name me a perfect film.
3831;steven Spielberg has created a masterpiece wich will stand the test of time.
3832;It is simply one of th finest films ever made.
3833;I have watched a lot of movies in war movies, [Private Ryan}, is the one of the best movies that I was moved.
3834;and I was very surprised about that the movie's making skill was wonderful.
3835;The sound was very real.
3836;That scene was very real.
3837;the movie makers must have known about techniques how to take a film for exciting audiences.
3838;No question, it's a great movie, showing history of WW2.
3839;First, I thought this movie had some of the most impressive scenes ever in a war movie.
3840;This is an excellent movie.
3841;It is very gory though, but realistic.
3842;the first 1/2 hour is a moving experience, that shows what our troops are going through to keep our freedom.
3843;This is the very best war film ever made by anyone.
3844;If you want to not only see what it's like being in battle but want to feel it as well, watch this remarkable film.
3845;Spielberg you did a great job on this dramatic war movie!
3846;Tom Hanks was outstanding character and looked like a Cpt.
3847;I think this is the best movie today and no doubt should of one 10 awards and expecially Best Picture and Actor(Tom Hanks)!
3848;Great performance by Tom Hanks.
3849;This movie really brings history to life.
3850;This movie has always been great.
3851;ray it is evan better.
3852;This is one of the best films that I have ever seen.
3853;notch acting all around as well as some great action sequences.
3854;I'm not going to give 5 stars to any movie, just because I'm not reckless with perfect praise, but I'll let you know a few things:First, 'Saving Private Ryan' is the most touching and heart.
3855;ridden emptiness of the heart).
3856;piercing sound, this is THE movie to get if you want to fully experience the power of this media format.
3857;Tough, unrelenting look at war, with fine performances by all and top notch production values.
3858;Its always wonderful to see the sacrifices previous generations have made to insure the freedoms we enjoy in the good ol' USA., i. e. in a top.
3859;rank production such as this.
3860;This happens to be one of my favorite films for a number of reasons.
3861;First, it has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film.
3862;These three things make Saving Private Ryan one of the best films ever in my opinion and something everyone should own.
3863;There are also great bonus features with this set such as behind the scene footage, interviews with the cast and crew, and much more.
3864;One of the best movies you will ever see.
3865;The first 20 minutes are the most tense moments I have ever seen on film.
3866;Saving Private Ryan contains possibly the most authentic.
3867;see film, the best war movie, perhaps, since Apocalypse Now .
3868;Spielberg was always a pretty overrated director.
3869;For a more accurate depiction of the horrors of war, check out the amazing Pearl Harbor with Ben Affleck.
3870;running Time: 170 minutesRated R for intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war violence, and for language.
3871;Saving Private Ryan is one of Steven Spielberg's most haunting and visually stunning films.
3872;One of the soldiers fighting is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances), who fights bravely, but you can see the terror that engulfs him.
3873;But with courage and determination by the team (although some members do lose their lives), they find Ryan.
3874;Hanks combines the perfect mix of wisdom and physical brutality in Captain Miller, a man who is equally haunted by the mission at hand and with what awaits him back at home.
3875;Not only are they perfect in the technical department, but when viewed in the simple context of men trying to survive the scenes are absolutely heart.
3876;Saving Private Ryan leaves an unmistakable imprint on the mind, where even those who dislike the movie will not be able to forget it.
3877;It is a wholly unique cinematic experience and one which should be endured by anyone mature enough to handle it.
3878;It transcends the medium to truly become a work of art, and it holds a rock.
3879;solid place in cinematic history.
3880;Minus 1 star for length .
3881;The first film is a thoughtful, powerful and grim view of US Infantrymen in WWII.
3882;Though the overall premiss of this film is a streching of history, the strength of the men who make up the Infantry Squad make it seem believable, most of time.
3883;His best role was in Forrest Gump and a close second is Cast Away.
3884;Always intelligent, responsible, caring, a great role model.
3885;Truly one of the best movies of all time
3886;And various scenes do this.
3887;a little of this style can go a long way.
3888;Some of the wobbly camera in the opening sequence, was very potent, like the troops running towards the beach.
3889;The truly outstanding radar attack sequence, stood out.
3890;That which is happening even as I write this, which I hope Spielberg or one of his other cronies may deal with in the near future, about Iraq.
3891;the entire Axis prisoner scene, was good.
3892;In SPR, Spielberg's more delicate and subtly discriminating add.
3893;ons, were clearly the best moments of the film.
3894;There are much better WWI&II
3895;this is a fairly good war film, but not a great war film.
3896;What the film clearly does wrong, cannot in the final analysis, overcome the few things it does really great and right.
3897;Best war movie of the century.
3898;An engaging movie, it kept the student's interest and engraved in their minds the history surrounding D. day and the significance of the landing and following occupation of France in 1944.
3899;Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan was considered by many as one of the greatest war movies.
3900;If you have good cover, then there is a good chance of taking such a beach.
3901;Basically the movie while well scripted uses patriotism and some good acting to capture the audience.
3902;I guess that since most people do not read about the war itself, they see the movies and accept that as the reality.
3903;Luck has a lot to do with winning, as was said by Napolean.
3904;Few holocaust movies ever mentions such an incident, as they always want black and white.
3905;This movie is highly realistic!!!
3906;this film may not be right for queasiest and the film is one of the best.
3907;The 2 battle scenes at the beginning and end of this movie are just incredible filmmaking feats by Spielberg and company and one should have this movie just to see them.
3908;And Tom Hanks is great, as he usually is.
3909;Give him a huge amount of credit for making such a difficult and brutal movie when he could be taking it so much easier.
3910;This film absolutely makes a mockery of films like John Wayne's Gung.
3911;This is how it was, and this is how we hope it will never be again.
3912;It is successful at frightening us with the most explicit and realistic battle scences in any war film ever.
3913;Detailed battle tactics intertwined with personal character touches and fantastic character development makes this not just one of the best war films ever, but one of the most important and best films ever made.
3914;Each and every perfomance is brilliant, the usual performance of Hanks, and of the scared and inexperienced Corporal Upham is something that many of us can relate to.
3915;If you've never given a thought to the bloody reality of war or the extreme sacrifice offered by those who have fought to keep this country free, this film will bring it home.
3916;his movies are popular,but they are far from great cinema.
3917;This is one of the truly good war flicks out there.
3918;There are plenty of war flicks, but not all of them are worth seeing.
3919;This is one of the ones really worth seeing.
3920;The acting in this movie is topped only by the incredible action scenes.
3921;But if you enjoy war films, make sure Saving Private Ryan is in your library.
3922;He was still alive when this movie came out and I saw it in the theater and told him about it.
3923;The rest of the movie is a story and I have no way to gauge how accurate it is, but I feel at least the beach invasion gives me a glimpse of the horror my grandfather witnessed as a very young man an event that helped shape the wonderful man he became and also drove every decision he made morally, politically and ethically the rest of his life.
3924;He was 18 at the North African invasion and 20 in the last at Okinawa .
3925;A great story showing the human side of war, set within the violence of the largest military invasion in history.
3926;Love love love this movie!
3927;always liked to watch the movie because it was very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through!
3928;I am a big fan of Tom Hanks movies and I am also a big fan of war movies.
3929;The depiction of D. day is so accurate and so greatly done that it still gives me chills just watching it.
3930;The story is wonderful and overall the movie is just fabulous.
3931;Steven Spielberg directs probably his most meaningful movie yet, and Tom Hanks does probably him most award winning performance.
3932;ranked as one of the top 100 films of all time, and once you watch it you will see why.
3933;It wants to be a powerful statement about the horrors of war, and a moving tribute to the men who fought and died in WWII, and a really cool war movie with lots of cool battle scenes.
3934;As in most Spielberg films, the material points one way, and Spielberg goes in another.
3935;Because, of course, you know that a movie is really good when it makes you cry, right?Well.
3936;What you see will shock and scare you, but ultimately will give you a look at the horrors of war.
3937;tom Hanks is brilliant as Captain John Miller, a smalltown school teacher turned war hero, and the actors who play the soldiers in Miller's company are unforgettable.
3938;saving Private Ryan is an incredible film, which will stay with you forever as we who never witnessed the horrors of World War 2 develop a greater understanding of the most important battle of the 20th century.
3939;A must have, and one to watch so that you gain a greater understanding of what war is really like.
3940;I can remember seeing this film in the theatre when I was about fifteen and my friends and I sat very close to the screen.
3941;There were also two veterans in front of us who shortly after the movie started began to sob.
3942;In the end, it was one of the most amazingly emotional experiences Ive ever had watching a film.
3943;The first 30 minutes of this film are unusually sobering to watch, just like they were in the theater when I first saw this film when it was released.
3944;other than that gaff, and it is a gaff, this is an excellent film as has been stated thousands of time since 1994.
3945;Those guys are big heroes of mine and I actually sent their Regimental Association a thank you email that basically read.
3946;I think Saving Private Ryan was the best and most realistic movie yet.
3947;A good performance by Tom Hanks.
3948;It was very exciting and unpredictable on what was going to happen next.
3949;I give it 5 stars!
3950;overall, I love this movie.
3951;I'm kind of a perfectionist, especially when it comes to collecting Spielberg's impeccable films.
3952;please, anyone, let me know if Spielberg has fixed it in the Blue Ray version.
3953;So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.
3954;however, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture.
3955;An absolutely great picture that is a must see.
3956;This is a movie to own!
3957;Speilberg has created a true masterpiece, with unforgettable images of the atrocities of war, BUT, basically this is a human spirit tale told expertly.
3958;But, spielberg's film is not about the homefront, he takes us to the battlefields of France (actully filmed in Ireland) and it is a remarkable journey.
3959;The opening 20 minutes are as real and gutt.
3960;wrenching as any I've ever seen.
3961;Steven Ambrose stated that WWII vets of D. dAY said they never thought they'd see their efforts portrayed on film with such stunning reality.
3962;While the individual personalities of the search squad present a mixture of pragmatism and stubborness, at various moments and, in the climactic battle, they individualy show us their deep dedication to their mission, their unit and, most of all, their brothers.
3963;I will close with this thought.
3964;When I first went to see Saving Private Ryan at the cinema I was impressed.
3965;It hits you with a massive initial impact which takes a long time to wear off.
3966;In fairness, Hanks' character is solid (and the bit with the pool on what he does in civilian life works well).
3967;In other ways it's a clear step backwards.
3968;The blood and guts and actual slugging it out may be a lot more realistic than all the various creaky 1960s and 1970s three.
3969;I know that he would recommend it to anyone.
3970;A team of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller and fresh from the beaches of Normandy, is assembled to find and save Private Ryan.
3971;Saving Private Ryan is a powerful experience.
3972;A brilliant but flawed masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan is ultimately no more than a series of encounters seemingly derived from previous war drama.
3973;While that may be the point, as far as I can determine, Band of Brothers is better and more consistent visually, as a reference.
3974;guts opening D. day sequence shows war at its most brutal and heroic, and is the best part of the movie.
3975;, (the sniper, the machine gun nest, holding the bridge, etc.) which pulled them off far better and with more engaging acting than Ryan.
3976;For anyone interested in military history, this is a must.
3977;But the acting is superb, the battle scenes are fantastic and Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar.
3978;still, this is one of the best war movies ever filmed.
3979;A rare experience for me a the movies.
3980;It made me appreciate the effort of our fathers and grandfathers much more.
3981;There's enough dialog to get through the story, but it's the story and journey that count here.
3982;This is about following orders, compassion, duty to country, family, and comrade.
3983;the technical details are top.
3984;The settings are incredibly realistic with bombed.
3985;I beleive this is one of the best movies I have ever seen , probably I will never forget Hanks' EARN IT phrase to Damon .
3986;It really touched me , stunning .
3987;The rest of the cast was exceptionally good .
3988;Every American should see this movie.
3989;The picture is vivid, the sound crisp and clear.
3990;It is arguably Tom Hanks defining movie that set him apart from some of the comedies that he'd done in the past.
3991;The movie makes you appreciate the sacrafices that our soldiers made during WWII, and clearly demonstrates the chaotic violence that they faced.
3992;This is a respectable release of a great movie.
3993;My grand son loves this movie.
3994;As a world war 2 buff and an American, this is my kind of movie.
3995;This one however is, in my opinion, the greatest war movie ever made, period.
3996;The squad that this movie follows is fictional (sorry based on true story fans) but the war is very very real.
3997;This story of courage and sacrifice really touched me.
3998;This is, by far, the best film I have ever seen.
3999;Spielberg uses such realism that we acutally forget that we are watching Tom Hanks, one of the most recognizeable faces in the world today.
4000;This film has such a realism (despite one Hollywood plot twist) that almost makes us tink everything is real.
4001;There is almos a documentary flavor to this film.
4002;The jargon the men use, the way scenes are shot (many with hand held cameras)and the washed out color all add to the documentary look.
4003;With this film, his career will be colmplete, it will be tough for anyone (even Speilberg) to top it.
4004;This film is one of the most realistic and least sentimental war movies ever made.
4005;It holds up well on re.
4006;The cast is outstanding, the script avoids most of the genre's cliches, the cinematography in a class by itself (especially in the invasion sequence), and the director avoids his usual mawkish sentimentality (for the most part) .
4007;I think this is the second best war film I have ever seen.
4008;The acting is as good as it gets.
4009;Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in history.
4010;If you love war films, you must see this film.
4011;I saw it in the theatre, and it leaves you scared, and drained.
4012;This is as good as they come.
4013;He was simply attempting to italicize one moment in history, in the middle of a gigantic slaughterhouse, so that the generation of men and women who probably came closer to saving the world than any generation before or since, could be recognized for their supreme sacrifice, as well as their supreme achievement.
4014;Spielberg's elegy is perfect in tone.
4015;And it moves me to see it again and again.
4016;If you are a big fan of war films, especially of WWII, you will enjoy this one.
4017;This is a great film and highly accurate in its depiction.
4018;overall, I highly recommend this one without hesitation.
4019;but it is important to see.
4020;This film portrays that with stunning clarity.
4021;How ever, Speilberg, A visuall Genouse, has all the talent and love of film to make every thing els work.
4022;A 23 minut sequence opens the film (after the grave yard) with the most violant, horrifing and realistic battle sequence I have ever seen on film.
4023;Tom Hanks giving great peformance of an officer who is human as any of us, trying to find a way home through the true horros of war.
4024;A very good movies that remember the big sacriface and effort made from USA soldiers and his families
4025;This has always been a favorite movie of mine.
4026;ray after installing a new home theater system.
4027;Awesome, and one of my favorite blu.
4028;Saving Private Ryan ranks as a second.
4029;rate World War II movie with a first.
4030;As demeaning as this criticism sounds, Saving Private Ryan is one of the top 25 World War II movies.
4031;Since Saving Private Ryan swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down and Sylvester Stallone's Rambo have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence.
4032;Similarly, letting Steamboat Willie go is another incredible lapse of believability.
4033;told from the perspective of the infantry, Saving Private Ryan shares in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic All Quiet on the Western Front, Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One, Lewis Milestone's A Walk in the Sun, and William Wellman's Background.
4034;Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that Saving Private Ryan commands, but they are solidly.
4035;made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories.
4036;This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics.
4037;The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera.
4038;I read into this movie much like I did Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List 
4039;I found this symbolism extraodinarily disturbing, yet effective in the way that within a matter of seconds, the destruction of European Jewry was played out on film.2.
4040;indeed, there are many ways of pointing out the greatness of this film.
4041;It will be appreciated and understood by anyone who chooses to do so.
4042;The first 20 minutes are very well shot with hand.
4043;Spielberg even provides the viewer with a furious hand.
4044;suddenly discover extraordinary qualities of courage and willpower within their hearts, choosing to sacrifice their young lives in behalf of the Cause, and offering a (once more, totally unrealistic .
4045;And has lots of expensive special effects and is commercially successful .
4046;a typically American movie in true Spielberg fashion.
4047;iMHO, the acting was excellent, especially the medic (giovanni ribisi).
4048;ok so spielberg had some flops with his movies like 1941 (what a bomb) but he is still one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, and schlinders list and SPR put him there.
4049;Steven Spielberg has done society a tremendous service in vividly bringing to life the horrors we have been spared.
4050;Those moments which would have died from memory with the men who endured them in 1944 are made real again .
4051;Spielberg has created a masterpiece of cinematography, not of literature, and more than any other contemporary film I've seen he uses the medium to the full.
4052;Attention to detail is astounding .
4053;listen out for the eerily convincing sound effects of bullets on steel girders in the opening landing scene.
4054;and technical brilliance in making it real.
4055;This is a great movie.
4056;But Spielberg is very artistic, and after seeing this The president might never want to declare war again.
4057;Probably the best WW2 film ever made , next to enemy at the gates, the pacific and band of brothers .
4058;The dream of peace , the dream of HOME .
4059;i was very surprised by reading some of the other veterans reviews .
4060;And I hope , I have people , who loves me .
4061;The writer of this film should have received an Academy Award alongside of Spielberg, it is nothing short of EXCELLENT!For the rest of my life I will watch this film along with the real D. day documentaries on June 6th.
4062;Spielberg has accomplished something with this film that touches upon both American pride and on the humanness of war.
4063;The scenes on the Normandy beach will reach in and grab ahold of your heart
4064;But then pride will well up inside that same heart and your entire being will cheer as the first soldiers scale the hill.
4065;The movie just continues from there with scene after scene of triumph and terror with a storyline that will match the action in intensity, something rarely found these days.
4066;Spielberg is a master director who believes in the truth and shoots his movies with conviction.
4067;ray disc since this movie has a great moral and lots of good actions scenes, but to my astonishment it was not yet available as a BD when I got my BD player.
4068;this movie is a bummer to watch and I'll never watch it again (with all due respect to Tom Hanks, a great actor)!
4069;inspiring, horrific and honest portrayal of the D. day landing and the extraordinary sacrifices made by ordinary individuals.
4070;held in your face film technique immerses the viewer into the action.
4071;Without a doubt, Speilberg's depiction of the landing on Normandy Beach is one the most intense battle scenes ever filmed.
4072;saving Private Ryan accomplishes what Schindler's list did in regard to the holocaust and what Oliver Stone's Platoon accomplished in its statement on Vietnam.
4073;in addition, Spielberg has not only paid a deserving tribute to the veterans of World War II, he has also produced an excellent anti.
4074;saving Private Ryan is without a doubt one of the most honest, realistic combat movies ever made.
4075;Although Spielberg may not have gotten it all down in regard to the war with Germany
4076;The first 30minutes are the best warscenes in history.
4077;The first 20 mins or so of the movie (set on Omaha Beach) is the only scene actually dedicated to the greatest day in modern history.
4078;I am thankful that Davies, Speilberg and Ambrose have helped to keep the brave and unselfish feats of our countrymen alive for some time yet.
4079;A great film on the whole yet i do suggest if you are indeed interested by D. dAY that you read a good book on the subject.
4080;From the opening scenes to coming full circle in the closing scenes, Saving Private Ryan is a movie and emotionally draining film that leaves you analyzing your own life to determine if you have led a life worth the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces have made.
4081;speilberg has created another masterpiece.
4082;Just when I thought he could not create a movie more vital than Schindler's List, he comes up with Saving Private Ryan.
4083;If you can stomach it though, I encourage watching the scenes because they set the tone for the characters.
4084;When you go into the bunkers, it is as if you can feel the ghosts of the Germans that were there.
4085;This movie with Tom Hanks is an all time classic.
4086;do The Longest Day in a manner he is more than well able to do.
4087;the greatest question posed at the end of Saving Private Ryan is was it worth it.
4088;Was it worth risking the lives of eight men just to save one, basically unimportant man just because his brothers were all dead?
4089;The other survivor is a very well educated corporal who's bilingual in German and French, which is why he was brought along.
4090;Still, had he showed more bravery and courage in the battle in the French town (He had a thirty caliber with a full belt, for pete's sake), at least two others in his squad would have either been saved or would have had an advantage against the Germans.
4091;It's better film wise to have the actors placed this way.
4092;that said, this is an excellent, powerful war movie.
4093;The battle scenes are stunning and, while ultra violent and perhaps made for action movie buffs, they make one hope that we or the ones we love are never have to be in those situations.
4094;Let me start out by saying that this is an amazing movie!
4095;It is an awesome movie.
4096;This is one of the best war films I have ever seen.
4097;Yes, the opening scene at Omaha Beach is riveting.
4098;And while the opening battle scene is good, if I want a ton of violence, I'll watch the far more entertaining Commando.
4099;No matter how horrific the battle scenes are, you still come away with a good feeling about the sacrifices that were made.
4100;The Normandy Beach scence was perhaps the best war scence ever created.
4101;The movie was very well done, and I STRONGLY suggest you watch it.
4102;The level of 'hooray for the good.
4103;Spielberg historically oversentimentalizes and cheapens incredible films in order to try and force meaning on them and 'gasp', yes, even make them more marketable to the masses who don't quite get Kubrick films.
4104;Ideologies can't ever compare to blood on the hands, and Spielberg lets that slide.
4105;the best, most realistic war movie ever made .
4106;Anyone who has had a relative in combat, especially W. w. iI, should force themselves to watch this movie, at least once, just to see, just to get a small glimpse, of what it was really like.
4107;This is a very moving tribute to those who died for our country during WWII (especially to those who sacrficed their lives on June 7, 1944 when Normandy was invaded.)
4108;Thank you Mr. Spielberg for telling the story the way it happened.
4109;One of the top three war movies ever made.
4110;I go back and forth on my feelings about Steven Spielberg as a director.
4111;saving Private Ryan has taken longer to percolate.
4112;It's great achievement (one worthy of study by film students) is the Omaha Beach invasion on D. day.
4113;It is, perhaps, the single best sustained action scene in recent memory.
4114;other scenes work well, also.
4115;By and large, the scenes were well handled, with thoughtful dialog and subtle acting.
4116;She calls the papers, she raises a stink, the AP gets hold of the story.
4117;Now Washington takes notice and leans on General Marshall .
4118;on balance, though, Saving Private Ryan is still a film worth owning.
4119;The technical achievement is undeniable
4120;All 5/5 stars for the first 15.20 minutes of the movie and the whole story of course is magnificent.
4121;This is my favorite WW II movie.
4122;Great job and a fitting tribute to those who died trying to liberate Europe from Nazism and Fascism.
4123;done and a great movie.
4124;The acting is great and the visual effects are very well.
4125;Moreover, the Robert Kapa's style of photography is amazing.
4126;Spielberg might be a typical liberal Hollywood star but his movies are fantastic.
4127;I think this is thus far the best WW 2 movie of the recent yrs.
4128;It makes the old John Wayne film The Longest Day and its depiction of that landing look like a Sunday stroll in the park.
4129;We are a ridiculous and heinous species, the scourge of our planet, and this film does a very good job of showing it.
4130;The film itself was the best war epic I have ever seen, and it was only improved with the Blu.
4131;ray edition i just viewed with the family.
4132;I am a veteran of Desert storm and appreciate the realism of the exquisite piece of work this film is.
4133;Saving Private Ryan is definitely one of my son's favorite.
4134;Although I personally am not really into the gore of World War II, it is very well made, perhaps almost too well made.
4135;Wouldn't have bought it if i didn't think so, Either way, ridiculously good movie
4136;this is a great film.
4137;I Love WWII history this film is well done and worth watching multiple times!!
4138;Although the proceeding description is often used and rarely substantiated
4139;the visuals are among the most haunting ever filmed, including a now justly famous opening battle scene which has set a new standard for battle scenes in war movies.
4140;The performances are heartfelt and memorable, and the largely unknown cast (for now), is absolutely superb.
4141;leading the way is of course Tom Hanks in, not his best performance, but a great one nonetheless in its understatement and quiet dignity, very well worthy of his Oscar nomination.
4142;ready translator, who is integral to the most haunting scene of the year.
4143;this is an excellent movie the should not be missed.
4144;It is expertly directed, acted, and scripted(a fact which was underrated).
4145;no matter what the Academy says
4146;Parts of this movie are just spectacular, from the super realism of the opening segments, landing on the Omaha beach, to some really precious intimate scenes during lulls in battle between the soldiers.
4147;This stuff is an affront to the real heroism otherwise portrayed.
4148;i liked this movie and I absolutely hated this movie, or what Spielberg thought he had to do to it.
4149;uS Rangers succeeded to hold the beach, after the heavy firefight with many casualties.
4150;The beach scene was really intense, showing you the cold hard reality of combat action during war time.
4151;won 5 Oscars in 1998 including Best Director (Steven Spielberg) and Best Cinematography (Janusz Kaminski).
4152;This is my favorite movie of all time.
4153;It doesn't look Speed Racer or Dark Knight good, but what they did to clean up the visuals give it a stunning makeover.
4154;The sound on a 5.1 Dolby system will make your ears tingle it's that good.
4155;I am so glad Spielberg made this film.
4156;It's important for us to recall the tremendous bravery and loyalty soldiers have shown so we could live free and in comfort.
4157;Those men of that generation were truly a great generation.
4158;Even if a war is started for duplicitous reasons (and I don't think WW2 falls in this category) one must remember that soldiers, for the most part, are acting from the heart.
4159;from virtue to fight for what they feel is right.
4160;We need more appreciation for the sacrifices previous generations have made.
4161;It's just the truth and this film has shown it.
4162;Good effects and realistic portrayal of war details should not compromise on a good storyline.
4163;Also, the movie represents the time of war with reality very well.
4164;The focus of these movies is to make people think about war.
4165;In addition, both are quite serious but touching movies because even during the war, in those movies, people still know the dignity of human beings and people try to help others.
4166;The movies are both famous, and valued as great works.
4167;the contrast, color vibrancy, detail, and the 3 dimensional pop are all fantastic!
4168;one disc is the feature film and the other disc contains extras.
4169;This movie provides the true horror of World War II, while also providing a 5 star plot and storyline and 5 star acting.
4170;SAVING PRIVATE RYAN tells the heartpounding and heartcrushing tale of ordinary men, doing extraordinary things.
4171;overall acting: 5 stars: Tom Hanks does an excellent, but quiet job in portraying his role as Captain John Miller.
4172;Also, Jeremy Daives does an great job on expessing his characters emotions and thoughts.
4173;overall plot: 5 stars: Captain John Miller must take his eight men on a journey through Normandy.
4174;Because of this, Private Ryan has a free ticket home.
4175;Great movie to teach teens what's a war means.
