1;He barely pays attention to his case.
2;Classic movie and its one of those movies you must see before its too late.
3;A man takes a taxi, her is being watched.
4;[Note the vent windows on cars.]
5;An older man enters the hospital and asks a question.
6;There is a chase to the basement.
7;Chalmers shows up, the patient was transferred.
8;A facsimile machine sends a photograph.
9;Bullitt returns to his girlfriend.
10;One of the best chase scenes of all times.
11;Love the movie and love San Francisco .
12;Steve Mcqueen hit the bullseye with this movie.
13;Robert Vaughn playing a slick oily politician is brilliant,the doctors and ancillary cops are actually doctors and cops[what a concept!]
14;It also shows the advantage of using top actors in this sort of movie: they give it just that little bit extra, that most action movies lack.
15;The plot was in its time quite original and it has been worked out with great talent.
16;Also pleasant is the relatively short length.
17;Now Bullit will keep your attention right to the end.
18;The plot slows at times, but has the greatest car chase ever filmed, and a great ending.
19;A great story, well told.
20;Very Good Action , we'll watch it many times.
21;I enjoyed the highlighting of new technology at the time like the fax.
22;The movie is actually very quiet with sections of almost no sound.
23;An enjoyable watch but not a repeat.
24;Love the action, plus you couldn't go wrong with Steve at the helm!
25;A classic movie that has one of the greatest, if not the greatest, car chase off all time.
26;thank you Amazon for making it so easy.
27;Steve McQueen is as smooth and cool as they come.
28;The cars are fantastic and the car chase will have you on the edge of your seat if you llove muscle cars.
29;Steve McQueen nails his role and the car chase was just as exciting as I remember.
30;This is a great film from the '60s.
31;We enjoyed it a great deal.
32;Glad to find that your company has a great many back in the day movies.
33;I feel they make us appreciate the newer films that much more.
34;As long as there is cars and action they are all cool.
35;a studied portrait of a simpler time.
36;my friend and I agreed, the car chase started with high realism.
37;Plus the greatest car chase ever!
38;And I'm talking actual car chase with cars!
39;The scene of the car chase was really great.
40;Enjoyed it as much as the movie!
41;great to see how far we have come in forensic police work!
42;Still the classic with the best car chase!
43;McQueen at his best doing what he loved.
44;Detail is OK in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows.
45;Blacks are unstable and milky, and there is motion judder and blur of in motion detail in shadows.
46;Good acting, great plot and very good music.
47;Best car chase and Steve McQueen is the best.
48;Always enjoy this and all the other Steve McQueen movies no matter how many times I see them.
49;Love the great old cars, especially the awesome 'Stang!
50;This is a great action movie with a great plot and great acting!
51;Steve McQueen has a very good role in this flick fast and smart.
52;The one car chase scene is good but does not make it a fantastic movie.
53;Being a native San Franciscian and growing up in the 60's, this will always be my favorite cop movie because it was filmed in my home town.
54;Car chase scene is a classic and if you have a big screen television monitor, your stomach will rock when they go flying down hills.
55;but it is still cool anyways.
56;Top critics probably loved it.
57;Thank you the movie was as good as the first time I saw it .
58;This is my favorite movie of Steve McQueen's.
59;i has a good caast and the plot is great.
60;Not only does it have the very firstand best chase scene.
61;the final part where MQueen chases the bad guy at the airport amongst the planes is great.
62;i recomend this movie greatly.
63;Bought this for my son.
64;He likes Mustangs and a good car chase movie.
65;"This classic cop thriller starring Steve McQueen helped define the ""cool cop"" genre, along with the Dirty Harry movies and a few others such as the original ""Shaft""."
66;She certainly caught a few eyes with her turn here as the girlfreind caught in the middle of Bullitt's violence.
67;charged Dodge Charger in a drive to the death (ah, back when cars really rattled the pavement with their sheer horsepower and all that testosterone rumbled down the street!)
68;One recalls the terrific sounds of all those upshifts and downshifts as McQueen, who insisted on doing his own stunt.
69;the film unrolls with a tight, interestingly written, and well.
70;When mob hit men fatefully interrupt such well.
71;laid plans, the plot spins into overdrive, and a masterful cat and mouse game ensues.
72;The supporting cast is terrific, and the hit men are well played with deadpan bad guy grimaces and suitable grunts and groans.
73;I love this movie as do most reviewers have seen it dozens of times since original release but would like to clarify the famous san francisco street driving scenes.
74;a great book with numerous unpublished photos full bio and movie history re STEVE MCQUEEN I bought thru amazon 3 yrs ago.
75;also great photos of MONACO WRISTWATCH
76;This is a great movie with the most revered and duplicated chase scene.
77;I ordered this movie for my husband, and he absolutely loved it.
78;He is a big Steve McQueen fan, and this movie was one of his best.
79;The film is grainy but in a good way.
80;Ultimate Classic Car Chase Movie Love It, fast start up, clear picture, menu easy to navigate, over all a good experience
81;This is classic car chase through the streets of San Francisco.
82;Best movie he made, understated and great camera angles, and music.
83;Classic Steve McQueen at his coolest and the best car chase scene ever.
84;This is a great movie.
85;the story line of this movie is terrific and keeps one on the edge of their seat.
86;This is an old classic from the 70's.
87;The chase seen is considered one of the best done, particularly for that time.
88;Good movie if you enjoy action films.
89;"When people talk about ""tough cop"" movies, this one always seems to come up in discussion, and invariably people will talk about the famous car chase scene."
90;It has been called the best chase scene of all time.
91;to be fair, the cars are pretty cool.
92;at any rate, for serious Steve McQueen fans, this movie is pretty much required viewing.
93;I always appreciate a great classic film, this fits the bill!
94;Anyways, there are a few good car chases but if you listen to Steve's car it sounds so perfect for this film.
95;I'm talkin' one car that can talk back with the pedal!
96;Classic car chase scene and classic Steve McQueen.
97;This was a very interesting movie.
98;Classic 70's Steve McQueen, one of the best car chase scenes ever.
99;excellent price and very quick delivery.
100;It's a crackerjack suspense story, complete with the now.
101;McQueen gained star status with this role, and the tough.
102;Timeless movie that takes you back to an exciting time if you lived through it or discovered it retroactively.
103;And of course it is classic Steve McQueen with a strong supporting cast, how can you go wrong?
104;Sure the story was great .
105;In fact, watch this film and follow it with a viewing of the Michael Mann film HEAT.
106;Pretty good flick as well.
107;Worth a watch, then you get to see epic car chase.
108;One of the best Crime.
109;Steve McQueen was great and the driving scenes are riveting, even today.
110;Awesome movie I have seen 20 times over the years and I still enjoy watching it every couple of years.
111;Steve Mcqueen best chase scene
112;If you're into classic movies, blu.
113;Bring back the days when you first went to the theatre to watch on the big screen.
114;Full of action and suspense.
115;Wish I could give it 10 stars.
116;"Fete of Death""Bullitt,"" one of the best crime thrillers ever filmed, also has one of the best."
117;"Cineastes refer to it simply as ""The Chase."""
118;"not only that, ""Bullitt"" is a taut cop thriller well directed by Peter Yates with a fascinating police procedural script and a pulsing, jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin."
119;"I would go out on a limb and say ""Bullitt"" is his best movie."
120;Certainly, it has his best role.
121;The best car chase in all movie history!
122;But, even though I discovered some of the chase scene trickery, I still think this is a good movie after all these years.
123;and that can only be a good thing, eh?
124;McQueen is the ultimate cop and the story line is very good.
125;There will NEVER be an action movie done with the realism as you see in Bullitt.
126;Watched this mainly to see the classic Mustang Gt and Dodge Charger chase.
127;That part was actually pretty good.
128;Bullitt magically comes close to him in the chase scenes after in reality the time separation was so great the guy would obviously be long gone.
129;Do yourself a favor and fast forward to the car chase, its somewhat worth it, though also a bit on the silly side at times, and certainly overplays what those cars were capable of.
130;Great movie to add to your collection if you are a car buff!
131;Forgot how great of an actor Steve was.
132;It has always represented, for me, a core theatrical experience, the essence of what it means to see a film.
133;I am delighted with the Blu.
134;and yet it has been so many, MANY years since the initial 1968 release, that one must now recollect what makes this classic crime film so special and unique.
135;What was cutting edge and fresh then, has achieved a cliche/cult status today.
136;(An unusual period in American history from 1920.1932).
137;but Bullitt elevated the detective genre to a new, hyper.
138;It was real this time, because it was all shot on location in San Francisco, which was a new thing in the 1960's.
139;Developments in film, cameras, and changes in the studio system itself, made it more feasible to shoot on location than ever before.
140;He and director Peter Yates were the team that brought Bullitt to the peak of realism.
141;(See special features on the disk for much more about this.)
142;So as a result, Bullitt gets really, really immersed in San Francisco.
143;actors after the shooting, in the hospital, and especially whenever police are on the scene, make this film maximally immersive in time and place.
144;The background layer of the city itself really holds just as strong a pride of place as the human characters.
145;The two fit each other like hand in glove.
146;the visual style that Peter Yates and Director of Photography William Fraker have put together here is extremely important, and it's consistent with the way Steve McQueen looks around with his big pearly blues.
147;"From the beginning open title sequence, a ""wandering follow focus"" style of shooting puts a marvelous, exploratory depth into the layers of action, searching, scanning constantly for his suspect."
148;The follow focus guy in Bullitt is an essential part of the cutting edge 1968 style, lending a freshness and spontaneity to all the locations.
149;which is so huge and extruded, it feels more like a public structure.
150;You can sense it in the subtle hints of the emerging counter.
151;and it is all so relevant today.
152;bright young law grads, police captains and the like, who get things done for him.
153;boiled world, and brings a touch of culture that, along with everything else, turns Frank's life into a high.
154;And makes it a life worth living.
155;The moment that discreet, professional hit.
156;band elements of Lalo Schifrin's score carbon.
157;Somehow, Schifrin bridged the musical gap between cops and culture in a new and very personal way.
158;Wow, how did they do that??
159;Men actually DO sweat, my friends.
160;is among the most startlingly real sounds in any film, ever.
161;edge design which starts with those simply incredible opening titles.
162;jazz main title merge to create the most graceful, utterly cool open title sequence in all of cinema.You can't deny those open titles are Bond.
163;mcQueen as Bullitt is soulful and woeful, subdued and pensive.
164;the burning desire to achieve a goal, no matter what the cost.
165;To survive, you always have to push the envelope to a new level.
166;That's what Bullitt does best.
167;This is one of McQueen's best.
168;The ultimate car chase movie, make that believable car chase, newer movies have computer enhanced car chases that are made for fantasy freaks but this chase is as real as it gets.
169;Clue, I thnk, to my enjoyment of Bullitt is that I've watched it about six or so times since I got it.
170;In asking this loaded question I will give you one more reason to watch it, one last time.
171;top reasons to watch this movie.
172;7)Because you saw it as a kid.
173;8) because you are at a friends house and he saw it as a kid.
174;"He's cool, for many that will be ""Nuf sed""."
175;"He's got a great ""Hollywood Ugly"" look."
176;dog eyes and just enough cragginess and weariness to make him seem like he understands our pain.
177;His look was perfect for The Great Escape.
178;We can move the background cars and they can go around the same corner again.
179;We see its dented body a few times and Steve pulls up to the hospital in it.
180;Bullit was Steve's character's name.
181;They used one or two cars and moved them around in the background.
182;Close up shot gun blast, close up, fast motion of body movement with red stuff on front.
183;You probably remember that cool car and how cool it looked and sounded.
184;"The best shot of the movie is a ""camera car"" tracking shot of the Mustang with Steve McQueen driving."
185;This is as good as it gets.
186;Details make it worth re.
187;8) Because you are at a friends house and he saw it as a kid.
188;Oh he looks good, he always looked good.
189;"She (and we) can't seem to make a connection to this ""strong silent type""."
190;He's good looking, tall, white and smart, or at least self.
191;He has an interesting job and he's good at it.
192;He's the one that can handle the dead bodies and protects his sensitive girlfriend (you know, the middle class one with the hippie sense of style).
193;Wow, this movie talks right to me.
194;Boy what a good movie.
195;If you are, good for you.
196;so please, if you are going to review this movie, watch it first so that you may give the most honest and most informed review (or rebuttal to this review) that you can, rather than going on old feelings and memories.
197;One of the greatest action flicks ever made.
198;Its a movie that will always be popular for generations to come.
199;I know many people like his Great Escape, and so do I, but this movie has it all.
200;Romance, intrigue and a fantastic car chase!!!
201;This movie, Bullit, is a great cop movie also.
202;"In fact if you like Steve, see his motorcycle documentary,""On any Sunday""."
203;Best car chase ever in a movie.
204;The cars in the really bring back memories.
205;Anyone who loves vintage muscle cars and four speed transmixer attached to a 1968 Ford Mustang GT and a Dodge Charger will like the chase.
206;This is without a doubt the best car chase movie ever.
207;It's good to have safety protocol's while making movies but they have become so tight that it will prevent a movie of this level from ever being made again.
208;it's fantastic, the art direction, the cars chases, and steve mc queen a real hero.
209;I forgot what a great movie this was.
210;I had viewed it a few years ago on T. v. steve McQueen was really great and I enjoyed the car chases and action.
211;This is undoubtedly the tightest, best.
212;"directed, best acted ""quiet anti."
213;Though there any number of great details to enjoy in this film (not the least of which is Jacqueline Bisset as a very glamorous architect).
214;this film's finest moments are the chase, of course and the powerful dialog.
215;the chase, if you know even a bit about San Francisco geography, is a physically impossible route, cutting from central S. f. to the Marina, etc., but it works brilliantly as cinema.
216;cool jazz theme, the film retains a certain auditory timelessness.
217;a masterful ending which captures the essence of the character, the violence of his profession, and his relationship with Bisset.
218;This was one of a handful of truly classic cop movies from the period.
219;"Steve McQueen is more Steve McQueen than usual
I:9809;220;If you liked the Dirty Harry series, the French Connection or the Seven Ups this is a must see.
I:9809;221;it's good to see Steve again though
I:9809;222;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:9809;223;Frank Keller won an Oscar for editing for """"Bullitt"""" and I can see why."""
224;It's hard to describe what makes great editing, but you know it when you see it.
225;Sometimes a shot will go on a bit longer than you expect it to, and, after viewing the shot, you realize how effective it was.
226;There are several such shots in this movie.
227;Bullitt features one of the most famous car chases in movie history (with McQueen doing his own driving!)
228;and it really is excellent.
229;Jacqueline Bisset's character doesn't add a lot to the plot, but she is nice to look at.
230;"I also enjoyed Simon Oakland (who played a recurring character on ""The Rockford Files"") as McQueen's boss."
231;One of the best Steve McQueen movies, this is probably one of my personally top ten movies I own.
232;The chase scene is fantastic and Steve McQueen plays his character very well.
233;year old movie, this still works.
234;Bullitt still has one of the best car chase scenes in movie history.
235;"The 1968 cop thriller ""Bullitt"" is one of those rare films where each time you see it, you get more out of it."
236;On the surface, this film has what ranks as one of the most famous scenes in history .
237;the classic car chase sequence between the Mustang and the Challenger.
238;It is an absolutely brilliant, fiery montage executed to near perfection.
239;"In fact, that scene alone won ""Bullitt"" its well."
240;And of course, the classic wake.
241;It's the trademark performance for this actor's remarkable career .
242;minimal dialogue, electric presence, piercing eyes, subtle physical reactions.
243;up, battling political brass every step of the way.
244;Bullitt's attempts at realism throughout gives the film its gritty feel.
245;The multiple camera angles, where scenes are shot through rearview mirrors, around windows and at a distance, reveals a creative, hip angle rarely seen in motion pictures today.
246;Bullitt undoubtedly is a product of its time .
247;In this case the film is better for it.
248;"director Peter Yates (who would never again make a film quite as good as ""Bullitt""), deserves much of the credit."
249;The location work, utilizing San Francisco perhaps better than any film in history, is innovative and inspired.
250;beat film that ever followed.
251;The image is cropped, especially on the top and sides.
252;Good flick, car chase was forerunner of many stunt effects to follow.
253;having visited and driven the streets of San Francisco one has a greaterappreciation.
254;This is an excellent movie!
255;I was told it's a classic and I loved it!
256;ray ,this is A MUST HAVE .
257;steve McQueen Looks Awesome .
258;He wore the part very well, becoming Frank Bullitt, a police detective who was interested in doing the best job he could with least amount of politics and brown.
259;And another thrilling chase scene on an airport runway.
260;in fact it was a film that was shot entirely on location and great attention has been taken to details.
261;The hospital scenes were actually shot in a wing of a hospital and real doctors and nurses played the doctors and nurses in the scene .
262;Robert Vaughn magnificently plays the utterly untrustworthy and oily slick rich politician.
263;He's used to having people say yes to him and do exactly what he wants, when he wants it.
264;robert Duvall pops up in the film as a taxi.
265;Norman Fell is also quite good in a supporting role.
266;It's a brilliant scene and one only a handful of directors today would have the power to keep it in their film.
267;Director Yates is a cameraman and editor himself, he knows how to make a sequence work to its fullest effect.
268;In this film he used William A Fraker as his cinematographer who create a realistic yet smooth (as opposed to a rough documentary type)look for the film.
269;It was nominated for a Best Sound Oscar and won an Oscar for Best Editing.
270;this is one of the best performances Steve McQueen ever gave.
271;He gives the role the intensity and depth it warrants while still moving about as gracefully as a Panther.
272;A steamy cyber thriller available January 2001.
273;Classic movie with classic cars and classic realistic chase scenes.
274;Steve McQueen is really a good actor!
275;Great car chase with wonderful effects, with music to hear the cars sounds.
276;Alright, the movie might not have the very first car chase in it, but it certainly set the genre' with a great series of shots (literally) during the movie.
277;Mcqueen wasn't the best actor in the world, but this classic is well worth the time.
278;something Jacqueline Bisset was a treat!
279;Aptly known as `The King of Cool', he still has as much screen presence some twenty.
280;I'm no gear head or anything, but the best part of this film was when McQueen's character turned the tables on those following him, which led into the chase sequence.
281;At one point we see both drivers engaging their seatbelts, and the hairs on the back of my neck prickled as I knew things were going to get good.
282;This was definitely one of the most memorable aspects of the film, but that's certainly not to say it's the only reason to check out this feature.
283;There are lots of great, low.
284;key performances, a solid story, interesting, actualized, and realistic characters, and wonderful location shots through out the San Francisco area.
285;Another aspect I really liked and one that stood out was the respect and confidence Frank's immediate superior had for him, allowing him the leeway to handle matters as best he saw fit, even despite Chalmers constant pressuring to turn over his witness.
286;This film is probably my favorite of McQueen's.
287;He was the essence of Hollywood cool when he was still around.
288;An excellent example of late 60s early 70s highly stylized moviemaking.
289;Includes an unmatched mixture of stark realism along with the type of departure from realism that can only surround a role filled by the legendary screen presence of Steve McQueen.
290;cool antihero character with the unlikely name of Lt. Bullitt .
291;Beat Dirty Harry by a year with its theme.
292;Additionally, no Hollywood composer caught the essence of late 60s early 70s style in films like Lalo Schifrin (who also did Dirty Harry), and this film is an excellent example of his work.
293;Film also boasts one of the most stylized opening title sequences in film history.
294;It's a pretty solid police thriller which features a famous car.
295;As a petrolhead, I've bought this movie for the carchase.
296;Although the locations appear familiar: the cars, fashion and music produce a late 60's San Frisco nostalgia trip for the viewer.
297;What I think that is not often understood, is why his style is so beloved.
298;The furniture is ordinary, with a few hip 60's touches.
299;It has dents in it.
300;in summary, I think it is funny that people idolize McQueen's personal style in this movie and yet they don't realize why.
301;Just something to think about as you watch one of my favorite movies of all time.
302;This is the movie that sets the mark for live action car scenes.
303;These are real cars, real drivers on real streets.
304;classic movie, best iconic car chase.
305;awesome cars, steve mcqueen was one of the best actors of his time.
306;the signature of this film is of course the wild and fast chase between Bullit's '68 Mustang and the killers' Dodge Charger through the hilly streets of San Francisco.
307;There were obviously car chases in movies prior to this film, but this chase brought filmmaking to a much higher energy level.
308;But the film has more to offer than just a memorable high.
309;First, the character of Bullit played by McQueen is arguably the first of many to follow of young, stylish, and radical cops that a young generation could identify with.
310;It's the coolness of McQueen under fire, his style of fast cars, a sexy girlfriend and fashionable clothes that elevate him above the typical suit.
311;tie, family man, and vocally brash movie cops of the past.
312;The other strength of the movie is that it does have a clever twist in the plot about two.
313;Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is the setting of urban San Francisco in the late `60's.
314;"There are plenty of bonuses including a short feature of the filming of Bullet, the history of editing and the best feature by far, a comprehensive film biography of McQueen entitled, ""The Essence of Cool""."
315;McQueen plays a supper cool and controlled cop.
316;Great scenes from SF too.
317;"This really is an unusual film in many ways
I:9809;318;bullitt sports an amazing cast: alongside Steve McQueen you have the lovely Jacqueline Bissett, Robert Vaughn, Robert Duvall, Norman """"Mr. Roper"""" Fell, Victor """"Mel"""" Tayback, and plenty of other actors I'm not familiar with serving up sustained dramatic brilliance."""
319;The final scene, for example, is quite subdued and unlike anything you'll find preceding any closing credits today.
320;Already detecting the faint but undeniable odor of a rat, Bullitt truly takes charge of the whole investigation, even as Chalmers pressures the higher.
321;The famous car chase up and down the streets of San Francisco is the highlight of the movie, but there's plenty of action all the way to the end.
322;the secret of the car chase's success is realism: no music, just tires squalling and engines revving (even if they're not always in perfect synch), with a great mix of external shots and point.
323;view shots from inside Bullitt's Mustang, putting you right there zooming up and down the steep hills of San Francisco.
324;The editing of this scene brought home an Oscar, and it's as thrilling today as it was in 1968 .
325;The best way I can explain why this is so is to say this: Steve McQueen is the man.
326;Furthermore, the music of Lalo Shiffrin brings a cool jazzy atmosphere to the ensemble.
327;One of Steve McQueen's best driving chase scenes ever.
328;If you want to watch the Steve at his best, it's one of his best.
329;McQueen was a great actor.
330;Obviously, this movie is a classic and I wanted to own it.
331;I was a teenager when it came out and Steve McQueen was one of my favorite actors.
332;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
333;It is especially good from the late 1960's.
334;The care chase is the best ever made.
335;Great flick, McQueen at the top of his game, not that he was anything other than at the top and worth watching just for the chase thru the city.
336;Probably one of the better chase scenes.
337;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
338;An immortal classic for Ford and Chrysler fans as well as crime drama fanatics!
339;It is indeed thrilling and tops most latter day CGI enhanced action sequences by a thousand miles.
340;This is the essence of Bullitt, a cop so dedicated to his job that he pays little mind to his basic sustainance.
341;As a policer, this film is top.
342;There is a good supporting cast here that includes Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's girlfriend.
343;This part could have been mere window dressing but Bissett has a scene where she confronts Bullitt about his choice of occupation and it's effect on his psyche that is quite effective.
344;"The inimitable Simon Oakland(""Psycho"", ""The Sand Pebbles"", TV's ""The Night Stalker) gives a solid account as Bullitt's no bull superior."
345;this is a great movie for it's time.
346;steve mcquenn is totaly awesome in this movie.
347;Great movie, I will gladly recommend this movie to any and all my friends interested in a classic Steve McQueen movie
348;Best car chase ever filmed, who wouldn't love to drive like that in San Fran!
349;Which doesn't matter a bit, because Steve McQueen is one of the coolest actors who ever worked in Hollywood and Jacqueline Bisset is a gorgeous girl, and this is a cool movie.
350;This clearly is the best car chase ever filmed.
351;Pure, raw power, undamped by catalytic converters or the need for fuel efficiency.
352;Truly one the best movies of its generation.
353;As always, Steve McQueen delivers and action packed performance as a San Francisco police detective investigating the death of a Chicago mobster who he was in charge of protecting.
354;Its always fun to watch this great classic.
355;Great cinematography, great shots of San Francisco and car chases.
356;This movie will inspire you to do some internet searching to learn just how the chase scene was engineered.
357;Bullitt is one of Steve McQueen's best movies ever.
358;When he further learns the man they were guarding wasn't even the right guy to begin with, it really hits the fan.
359;the film features a first rate suspense story.
360;"It also features two of the most famous ""chase"" scenes in film history, a car chase through the streets of San Francisco and a one."
361;one chase at San Francisco international airport.
362;the supporting cast is absolutely terrific.
363;Although there is very little actual violence, what's there has tremendous impact.
364;This is a movie that grabs your imagination while simultaneously kicking you in the gut.
365;Fortunately, it is a very minor part of the film and is easily overlooked.
366;this is classic McQueen, and any fan of the suspense genre cannot afford to miss this movie.
367;Back then one reviewer's comment was The most exciting ten minutes in movie history!
368;I still enjoy watching that scene, even with all it's faults.
369;The main storyline is decent but can be a bit slow at times but hey, it's McQueen!
370;The action starts around the 1:02 mark.
371;"His insistence on filming it on location caused his studio to back out due to cost fears so he produced it independently
I:9809;372;Bullitt is worth watching for more than the car chase however, and features solid supporting performances from Robert Duvall, Robert Vaughn and Simon Oakland.
I:9809;373;Bullitt (1968) is tightly written (the script), well directed, well acted movie.
I:9809;374;steve McQueen's facial closeups are a very important part of the success of this movie.
I:9809;375;He was a true movie star, a magnetic personality always interesting to watch in all ways.
I:9809;376;the opening credits done by Pablo Ferro Films are notable, and one of the reasons the movie gets off to a good start and makes friends early with the audience.
I:9809;377;the credits are creative, interesting, compelling, and a bit eerie in a good way.
I:9809;378;he urged VIP visitors to pay particular attention to """"our great chase scene"""" in the movie, and clearly regarded that as the high point of the movie."""
379;Bullitt (1968) actually has three chase scenes.
380;the entire BULLITT (1968) San Francisco CA USA movie premiere event held during October 1968 was exceedingly and intentionally glamorous.
381;people in 1968 still dressed elegantly, men still wore suits and ties to work routinely, and the informal dress and grooming of the 1960's counter cultural revolution had not yet made its way into mainstream culture.
382;Though it's best known for the epic car chase, Bullitt also succeeds as a police drama and a study of its main character, Frank Bullitt, as he tries to reconcile the realities of his job, the power plays of a manipulative politician, and the free.
383;iconic cars and and chase scene.
384;I remember this movie from when I was a kid.
385;Still holds up after all these years.
386;The chase scene is still one of the best.
387;Bullitt maintains his cool and commences to uncovering some surprising answers.
388;Very good story and more well remembered for its classic car chase sequence when Bullitt finds the hit men still lurking in San Francisco.
389;The chase impressed audiences back then and will still stir viewers' adrenaline today.
390;Director Peter Yates' work is smart and McQueen under his direction is in fine form as a slick police officer who carries out his investigation without excessive machismo or silly rhetoric.
391;The film has a nice style, enhanced with a '60's jazz music soundtrack.
392;Some nice features are included, especially a short documentary about the movie production.
393;The realism, and use of sound and editing to put the audience right in this escalating duel of muscle cars are a revelation to those who haven't seen it in its entirety, and context in the film.
394;gratingingly suspenseful from the outset.
395;ray] you can appreciate that McQueen had a distinctive tone and intelligence that he wanted his star vehicles to convey.
396;the BD comes with several extras, including a superb full.
397;ray] release, in which colors and definition go haywire in a few spots, this BD of McQueen's signature late 60s production is fine.
398;The colors are consistent and well balanced for the film stock and cinematography of that time.
399;range sound presentation (important when you hear that Mustang really rev up).
400;What has this man been up to, I question myself.
401;again, Bullitt doesn't talk very much but his eyes, his mouth, his face convey emotions of a confident man, an intelligent man, with a mind of intrigue.
402;"When heat is put on him from the ""higher up"" to handle the incident quid pro quo Bullitt, with few words, initiates a fascinating ploy to disrupt their plan."
403;"Whether we see him as Bullitt, or McQueen on the ""set scenes"" he is one cool guy, self possessed, confident, and not arrogant."
404;Robert Vaughn is such a high class, cultured protaganist.
405;Also Robert Duvall makes an interesting taxi driver for this bit part in the film.
406;Funny how you missed the repeating of the same scenes over and over to make up the car chase when you are a teenager.
407;Good for a few memories and laughs.
408;The cinematography was excellent so was the music and the acting.
409;Far removed from his The Blob days this is a mature McQueen .
410;one that grips you and pulls you into the gritty nasty big city crime.
411;But the story is the thing and watching McQueen is mesmerizing.
412;Have watched this classic many times and the bonus features are also very interesting.
413;The score by Lalo Shiffren is wonderfully evocative of '60's San Francisco.
414;Yates is preoccupied with showing us human beings through windows, through windshields, through their reflections.
415;item was the one I wanted, sent the item with no delays, very good price thanks I am a very happy customer
416;I lived in San Francisco about the same time this great classic was filmed.
417;Watch it with the sound off if you just want some cool vintage background video at your next party while you blast some music.
418;That's about all it's good for.
419;Bullitt and Mcqueen Good classic movie!
420;The direction and driving stunts were brilliant .
421;As I get older I watch BULLITT more and more.
422;For example, when Bullitt makes his visit to his girlfriend's place of work, he goes up a staircase with a striking blue bannister against a white background.
423;other effects are simply beautiful, and derivative of nothing.
424;Bullitt is looking down at her with a sympathetic smile.
425;The sudden transition is startling and very well done.
426;another excellent effect: Bullitt pursues the killer into the basement of the hospital.
427;Bullitt is moving slowly past the beds and hospital equipment in the dark, and we see the killer hiding behind a pillar.
428;Stay away from those windows, Bullitt admonishes Ross.
429;it is this complexity of the story, along with Yates's filmmaking skill, that make BULLITT one of my favorite thrillers.
430;contains the quintessential car chase through the streets of San Francisco,featuring a Dodge Charger and a Ford Mustang.
431;the story is still good.
432;Robert Vaughn is convincingly detestable.
433;the Mustang still sounds great!
434;One is the iconic, oft.
435;bullitt is a classic McQueen role, played as understated, realistic, single.
436;hero absolutely without frills or pretension and utterly inhabited by McQueen.
437;this movie is highly recommended to fans of Steve McQueen.
438;Forty years on, it holds up remarkably well as an example of some of his best work.
439;so, the first reason to see this movie: Steve McQueen does an excellent job of portraying Frank Bullitt as a police detective so emotionally buttoned.
440;He's an avatar of that most American of hard.
441;There's a reason this scene is famous, folks: it's just damn good.
442;Only the chase scene in The French Connection eclipses Bullitt .
443;but that's a car chasing an elevated train.
444;credit for the success of this scene, while obviously we must recognize the director/cinematographer/editor, must go mostly to Bill Hickman and Steve McQueen.
445;McQueen, himself an accomplished auto and motorcycle racer, insisted on doing his own driving in this scene.
446;Instead Hickman and McQueen slide smoothly through corners, their cars look they're being driven by pros .
447;after all the lame car chases we've all suffered through over the years, it's great to see it done right.
448;Bullitt covers a great deal of San Francisco.
449;ramp launched cars twisting unrealistically in the air, supposedly airborne after touching the nose of another car.
450;Bullitt has a gritty reality.
451;Yet this seemingly exciting life is also portrayed in a common circumstance.
452;This makes the movie a classic to me: it is a snapshot.
453;This is why I like many of the independent movies these days: economical in delivery, and complex in concept: not elaborate, excessive stunts.
454;Keep the effects within the story line, and move on.
455;A rare commodity these days.
456;In 1967 I had an apartment very near where Bullitt's is and I love all the scenes of San Francisco throughout the movie.
457;It still has a simple realism that captures you.
458;Everyone mentions the chase scene, but I think the airport scene is great too.
459;Part way through the movie I was thinking, 'This is quiet.'
460;for the price it is worth putting in your collection though.
461;This is a great chase movie, classic McQueen.
462;This is an ultimate classic that reminds us of days when technology didn't solve every crime.
463;the person I gifted it to liked it.
464;This is the same formula that Bullitt uses, and it's still got the best car chase of any cop movie.
465;Just as good as the first time we saw it, car chase still will get you to the edge of your seat.
466;San Francisco at its gritty best and certainly one of the best car chases of all time.
467;A must view of a classic.
468;It's aclassic with a great chase scene that goes on for some time.
469;The driving sequences are a classic with two of the most powerfull muscle cars of the era.
470;Steve play a great cop and the mystery keeps you guessing.
471;I rcccommend this movie to all action fans.
472;I encouraged the growth of warts on my face.
473;"I saw this again last night for the first time in years and it reensured what I believe all this time: ""Bullitt"" is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life."
474;It will take a long time for me to find a movie that can top this.
475;"Not only that, but ""Bullitt"" is the only movie I know that grabbed my heart and moved me deeply."
476;Speaking of that there is a revealing scene in which the witness is shot and eventually killed in the face.
477;The movie along with the car and airport chase is a true masterpiece.
478;The perfect vehicle (no pun intended) for McQueen, who was the coolest of his time.
479;He is perfectly cast as the detective who has seen it all, is tired of the dishonesty, but still will not let anything keep him from doing his job.
480;Between this film, The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape, the McQueen Legend was made.
481;The signature moment of the film is the chase scene, and it is the only one by which all others must be measured.
482;strong supporting roles by Don Gordon who is wonderfully understated as his partner and Jacqueline Bissett as his girlfriend (you KNOW anyone that cool would have to have a stunning beauty, of course).
483;along with Dirty Harry and the French Connection, Bullitt is among the best cop movies ever.
484;And the best example of this is in BULLITT, one of Hollywood's best police dramas ever.
485;fashioned, released as it was in 1968, BULLITT is superb entertainment, incisively helmed by British director Peter Yates and excellently photographed on location by master cinematographer William Fraker.
486;Lalo Schifrin's classic jazz score gives this film the perfect atmosphere, and Frank Keller justly won an Oscar for his film editing.
487;including, of course, the 11.
488;McQueen is, of course, so cool under fire, and Vaughn is ruthlessness personified.
489;It will make you appreciate that you are living and watching movies in the 90's and 00's.
490;Pay particular attention to the car chase.
491;The ending is also surprising.
492;Still the best realistic chase scene (imo) ever put on film.
493;it captured my attention and Bullitt would hold up to 2013 action movies.
494;Steve McQueen was laid back, smooth and very sexy.
495;The chase scene is likely the best ever filmed, even though the technology has now been surpassed, the reality shines.
496;The audio is fantastic too.
497;The movie was delivered quick and easy to my home!
498;The movie was a bit slow, but the car chase senes was worth it!
499;Still the greatest chase scene on movie history.
500;The king of cool and one of the best, if not the best movie car chase ever.
501;the original great car chase.
502;one of the best police movies ever.
503;Buckle up that seatbelt that first appeared on these cars and hit the pedal.
504;This film was great on VHS!
505;A classic movie that helped spawn the chase scene and crime genre as a whole.
506;McQueen is an absolute legend.
507;One of the best movies of all time.
508;"McQueen sets the bar for ""cool""."
509;The car chase is the best ever filmed.
510;Thie movie is a must for any/all collection/s.
511;I bought this disk mainly for the car chase because it is one of the best chases I have ever seen in a movie.
512;If you like wild car chases, this is the movie to see again and again.
513;Steve McQueen turns in a terrific performance, but the cast of characters also meshes well with his character.
514;This cast of characters has to be one of the best ever.
515;Whoever came up with the chemistry in this movie is a genius.
516;These two guys are definitely enjoying their work.
517;He is a tough straight.
518;The dialogue in this movie is memorable, especially between McQueen and Vaughn.
519;Lalo Schifrin's music keeps this flick moving.
520;A once and done enduring classic, to be left that way.
521;and this one's got San Francisco in all it's glory and a great plot besides.
522;Even though this is an oldie but goodie I just love it.
523;That car chase is the greatest.
524;The whole movie is good and has plenty of action and lots of shots of San Francisco.
525;It's a movie that's just as good today as it was back then and that includes all the actors as well as the story.
526;It's a great movie and I highly recommend it.
527;I am pleased with the product that was shipped with one exception.
528;Nevertheless, the picture is good and the price was right.
529;sit back and enjoy McQueen at the peak of his game.
530;Bullitt is a 1968 American thriller film starring Steve McQueen, Jacqueline Bisset, and Robert Vaughn.
531;The film won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (Frank P. Keller) and was nominated for Best Sound.
532;Writers Trustman and Kleiner won a 1969 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay.
533;Bullitt is probably best remembered for its car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco, regarded as one of the most influential car chase sequences in movie history.
534;The Bullit nameplate on the steering wheel honored the movie that made the Mustang one of the most popular cars of the 1960s and 1970s.
535;The green color was also brought back for the anniversary edition.
536;Chalmers arrives at the hospital on Sunday morning and is angered that Ross has disappeared.
537;Since the major portion of the story in the film takes place over a Saturday and Sunday, this was actually in keeping with some police department's traditions of a more relaxed dress code on weekends for plainclothes officers.
538;Steve McQueen was great in his character Bullitt.
539;I thought that Jacqueline Bisset was great as Bullitt girlfriend.
540;She also looked great in Bullitt blue dress shirt.
541;I love the car chase scenes through San Francisco.
542;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie so I'm giving this movie 5 weasel stars.
543;The Mustang vs. Charger chase scenes are considered a classic by all us gear heads.
544;I picked this movie to watch based on the number of good reviews.
545;I'm sorry, with this good a cast, I expected more.
546;Steve McQueen is the king of cool, shows it in his performances.
547;this movie has one of the best car chances ever filmed.
548;lots of drama and action, well worth watching again.
549;San Fran was and is a great setting.
550;I'll watch it again in a few years and still love the fab cars of the 60's.

554;This movie is a car lover's dream.

I:9809;559;Peter Yates has a smart thinking man's cop drama, bolstered by (yes) the best chase scene on film.

568;If you like Steve McQueen and San Francisco, you will love the movie.
569;It has a great story with a few twists and turns.
570;The scenery of San Francisco is beautiful and the greatsest chase scene can be seen.
571;The chase scene takes about seven minutes with some very unique footage of, I believe, Divisidero Street.
572;Along with the action, the story is also very good.
573;Not much to say, I got what I ordered in a timely manner.
574;Watching on a small screen at home I'd recommend turning out the lights during the chase and enjoying the 7 minute rollercoaster ride.
575;I know that many movies that followed had impressive and more complex car chases but Bullit was first.
576;So you can say that Bullitt created a subgenre of movies that lasted for more than a decade.
577;Now the movie storyline is great too.
578;The movie is done in a realistic, gritty style that has moments of explosive violence punctuating intelligent dialogue, acting and storyline.

601;If you want to step back in time and see what 60's cool was about this movie is a great opportunity.
602;Correct description and be honest about your product.
603;Bullitt is an intense and suspenseful crime drama that features the famous car chase through San Francisco.
604;steve McQueen is memorable in the lead role, with excellent support from Don Gordon as his partner, Delgetti, and Robert Vaughn as the powerful 'good guy / bad guy'.
605;It's good fun with a number of known continuity errors (passing the green VW Beetle at least three times, as well as the white car (Pontiac?))
606;In any case, it's a must.
607;"see for classic muscle car fans, and the best moments are the ""you are there"" moments filmed over the drivers' shoulders."
608;At times, it seems so real that it almost feels like a documentary.
609;the plot has enough twists to keep you going.
610;the soundtrack works well for the era, as composed by Lalo Schifrin.
611;The opening titles is one of my favorite movie themes.
612;It's jazzy and it fits the film well.
613;my favorite part of the film is its opening sequence.
614;That, with the already mentioned music, creates the most enduring impression with me.
615;bullitt is not a perfect movie, and not quite the classic that some would make it to be, but it's definitely worth seeing and owning.
616;It holds up well after all that time.
617;everybody talks about the famous car chase on the streets of San Francisco.
618;On the other hand, there is another great chase that takes place on foot at the San Francisco airport.

653;Frank Bullitt (McQueen) is the man for this somewhat mysterious job.
654;not to be missed is the classic car chase that is a cinematic legend.
655;The simple act of having a camera in the back seat gives us the roller coaster feel of the car flying over the hills of San Francisco.
656;Obviously, the scene had to be planned meticulously and it works far better than anything you'll see in the day of computer generated special effects.

667;"For those who are curious, I recommend three films: 1972's ""The Getaway,"" 1963's ""The Great Escape,"" and the film that formed the cornerstone of his reputation, 1968's ""Bullitt."
668;"the centerpiece of ""Bullitt""'s reputation, along with McQueen's legendary performance, is a hair."
669;So famous and so expertly was this sequence staged that the film won an Oscar for film editing even though it received only one other minor nomination (for Best Sound), which is almost unheard of.
670;Vaughn is a worthwhile adversary as a politician who (surprise!)
671;is ambitious to the point he can't be trusted, and Jacqueline Bisset has a few touching scenes as Bullitt's sensitive girlfriend who has a hard time reconciling the quiet man she loves with the policeman who is so jaded he can look at a young female murder victim and not be moved in the least.
672;"but this is McQueen's film the entire way and he is absolutely legendary in a role that, along with Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle in ""The French Connection"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan, created the modern screen image of the iconic, tough police officer."
673;solid script, which substitute thrills with unyielding realism.
674;The photography and music are stellar, and the editing, well, as I said before, is Oscar.
675;"in all, ""Bullitt"" is one legendary film that has aged well, still looks great after 36 years and remains thrilling to this day."
676;In all, its a great introduction to a true movie star who deserves to be rediscovered by future generations of film fans.
677;It stands on it's own as a true American classic.
678;Another time capsule movie that shows '60s movie making at it's best.

682;Best long, continuous car chase scenes in the street and outskirts I have ever seen.
683;This movie looks great on Blu.
684;best film chase scene close to the French Connection's.
685;This movie has a good cast and a good director, but the story is loose.
686;Jackie Bisset, gorgeous as ever, is mere window dressing in this one, and Robert Vaughn, a very good actor, isn't given enough to work with.
687;Steve McQueen is a great actor.
688;Action, suspense, a great chase scene, everybody should see this.
689;robert Vaughn has always been great to hate as well.
690;Just watch the car chase on YouTube and be done with it.

718;"For people with absolutely nothing to do,rate the famous chase scene in this legendary hit with the one 3000 miles away several years later in ""The French Connection""."
719;Bullitt is an extraordinarily influential movie, which is still entertaining.
720;it is rated as one of the best action movies of all time, with its fantastic car chase through the streets of San Francisco.
721;besides that, the tight script and excellent acting make this a rewarding film, even 45 years after its release.
722;hero: a maverick, yet incorruptible.
723;a great movie, both for pure entertainment, as well as for the student of cinematic art.
724;Frank Bullit is McQueen's performance masterpiece.
725;It is here that his acting style comes to complete maturity and we see the man whose body language was so evocative become a true protagonist.
726;"He is ""good copy"" in the newspapers, making him ""cop of choice"" for aspiring local politicos like San Francisco D. a. Walter Chalmers, played so well by Robert Vaughan."
727;He has Jacqueline Bisset for his live.
728;Because he oozes professionality, never hesitates, carries himself with a confidence never betraying that he is an actor portraying a detective.
729;He says very little and can communicate a wide range of feelings with his eyes or the trace of a smile.
730;All of this is delivered with an authenticity that is complete integrity.
731;Every scene is his and he knows it.
732;Robert Vaughn gives his best ever performance in any film.
733;Great to see San Francisco in good times past.

746;"steve McQueen reportedly said that ""Bullitt"" was his personal favorite film role."
747;at the time,he was one of the top box.
748;office draws in the world and one of highest paid actors.
749;Extra features are always great too.
750;this movie is great because of the realism applied topolice, hospital, and morgue procedures, not theatrical thatswhat makes it good, not to mention the awesome chase scene one of the first of its of kind, and one that all scenes are measured against, not a whole lot of action,not much violence,nudity, or profanity makes this a great movie for younger audiences, the plot is great, and mcqueen is awesome.

769;This movie really captures the person that McQueen was in real life.
770;Again, this is pure Steve McQueen at work, and he does most of the driving himself.
771;For muscle car lovers of the 1960's, you'll love the battle between McQueen's Mustang and the bad guys' 1968 Dodge Charger R/T.
772;"My favorite line in the movie is when Jacqueline Bisset asks McQueen: ""What will happen to us in time""."
773;see McQueen film and one of my all time favorites.
774;The views of San Francisco are breathtaking and all the cars from the 1960's just parked along the streets make for plenty of eye candy for auto enthusiasts.

788;I am usually not one to remake a great film but this is not a great film, Steve McQueen is great, the car chase is great, the music is great and seeing San Franisco in the late 60s is great but the story/script can easily be tightened and re.
789;made to a superior story.
790;Great movie and awesome car chase.
791;These classics are just that, classics.
792;Plus, Steve is totally cool
793;This did not have the impact on me that it did when it was new, but it's still a heckuva flick and McQueen is as cool as he ever was.
794;Best Cop movie out there.
795;This is one movie that I've been wanting to see and it was a real good movie.
796;Cool movie, a little long, and you have to wait for the one of the best car chase scenes.
797;It's a Good movie, and steve mcqueen does not act much, but it's good, it's street, gritty.
798;Again this is a solid detective movie but what sells this movie is that chase!!
799;Good story and a top of the line car chase through a city that was custom made for a car chase scene.
800;Finnaly the most original film bought to a two.
801;Yes I loved this film I saw when I was 4 years old and was fascinated with it!
802;I hope you enjoy this film.
803;This movie is quintessential Steve McQueen.
804;This movie has arguably the best car chase scene in movie history.
805;I liked the stars of the movie.
806;I'd recommend it to those who like old cars, fast driving and action.
807;A classic in every sense of the word.
808;greatest car chase in the history of film!McQueen proved to be a natural in roles like this.
809;Great old school movie great chase scene steve mcqueen is great great story line and lots of suspense great shots of san fran
810;the mustang , the charger 1960's San Francisco very nostalgic.
811;This film won an Oscar for Best Editing!
812;"please, give me a break
I:9809;813;the only redeeming qualities of this movie are Steve McQueen's cool acting, the car chase scene and seeing some nice sports cars from the 1960's.
I:9809;814;i considered giving it two stars just for Steve, the chase scene the nice cars and the film does at times has a nice stylized feel to it.
I:9809;815;Still a good movie to watch!
I:9809;816;What can you say but it still is a classic movie.
I:9809;817;Still like the car chase and always like Steve Mcqueen movies.
I:9809;818;I know there is not much of a plot to it, but it is a very enjoyable movie with excellent performance by Steve McQueen.
I:9809;819;the directing was just like mcqueen's performance, one dimensional tardiness.
I:9809;820;maybe I am recalling the visceral feelings I got from watching the movie.
I:9809;821;so the whole movie filled our field of vision.
I:9809;822;enjoy it for its rawness and utter power.
I:9809;823;I wish everythingwent as good.
I:9809;824;Standard cop drama with some stiff acting, in parts, what keeps the movie unique is its 40 years old and still has the best car chase scene ever filmed
I:9809;825;If you like muscle cars, watch this one.
I:9809;826;Everything I love about the 60's, cool clothes, hot cars, bad ass leading man and oh yeah a solid plot.
I:9809;827;don Gordon gives a standout performance as does Robert Vaughn who seldom failed to give of his undoubted best certainly during the 60s.
I:9809;828;A very watchable film for many reasons.
I:9809;829;Very good movie and the picture was excellentI will see the movie againThe color and settings were excellent
I:9809;830;tHE iconic car chase scene.
I:9809;831;Eventhough you seen it a dozen times, still entertains.
I:9809;832;I watched this on cable many years ago with my dad such a great movie and one of the best car chases ever.
I:9809;833;the good and the bad: True, there is a high.
I:9809;834;Is it the best ever chase?
I:9809;835;It was very high speed.
I:9809;836;Turns out Ross may not be who the cops think he is, and this leads to a good foot.
I:9809;837;good acting by McQueen and Vaughan.
I:9809;838;This is a classic film,which deserves a five star rating.
I:9809;839;Arrived in excellent condition in a very timely manner.
I:9809;840;Steve McQueen was one of the best actors as is his movies.
I:9809;841;The movie itself was cop/bad guys drama, excellent car chase!
I:9809;842;The quintessential cool movie of its era.
I:9809;843;That is the reason I ordered this Great Movie
I:9809;844;The main difference I can see on the Blu.
I:9809;845;It still has a great car chase.
I:9809;846;The fax sequence is pure contempory filming.
I:9809;847;Great leap back in time of San Fran.
I:9809;848;This was a gift for someone.
I:9809;849;This is one of their favorite movies and it came sealed and very quickly.
I:9809;850;For years, I've heard about how this was one the best car movies ever, with the Mustang.
I:9809;851;charger chase, so I finally picked it up.
I:9809;852;The hospital chase was pretty good though.
I:9809;853;the sound and picture were good, considering the age of the movie.
I:9809;854;I collect things all year round for christmas and this movie is one of my brother in law's favs, so it's going in his Santa bag.
I:9809;855;The Mustang chase is the best, worth watching just for that.
I:9809;856;Finally, this Christmas we got it for him and he enjoyed it as much as he did watching it the first time.
I:9809;857;Well written story and very suspenseful.
I:9809;858;steve McQueen and Jacqueline Bissetare wonderful in movie.
I:9809;859;He had come from humble beginnings and by 1968, was a superstar playing in the haunting and then sexy Thomas Crown Affair.
I:9809;860;Great dialogue possibly typified by the times, odd times for movies, Vietnam, music, hippies, counter culture and a whole lot of other things.
I:9809;861;And, with the possible exception of Petersen's car chase in the little known """"To Live and Die in LA,"""" maybe the greatest car chase film ever, with McQueen's beautiful 390 GT Mustang versus the Dodge Charger."""
862;Great service and arrived early.
863;"Great old movie AND movie of the week."""
864;See Jakie Bisset that young was worth it.
865;ray case itself states, but in 1.85:1, a considerable difference!
866;I think this is one of his best movies.
867;The chase scene with Steve and the bad guy on the runway was exciting as well.
868;"Buckle up
I:9809;869;A must see and you'll likely watch it many more times.
I:9809;870;A classic that will last for a very long time.
I:9809;871;The car chase in this movie is the reason I can watch it and still be excited!
I:9809;872;To see the drivers going through the gears and hear those powerful engines do their stuff, it's a thing of beauty!
I:9809;873;Its still worth it and enjoyable like always.
I:9809;874;The all time best car chase movie and the one all others try to emulate, including the French Connection.
I:9809;875;However, the movie is much more with great performances turned in by a brooding and quietly strong Steve McQueen, a sensual Jacqueline Bisset in her prime and a sinister Robert Vaughn who set a new movie standard for ambitious and ruthless politicians from this movie forward.
I:9809;876;A true classic of the cop genre that excellently captured sixties San Fran.
I:9809;877;You will thoroughly enjoy the action, story and drama of this film.
I:9809;878;I like movies about San Francisco, as I've been there many times.
I:9809;879;The classic car chase was exciting, and the villains got what they deserved.
I:9809;880;But it's a San Francisco movie, and I can relate to Steve McQueen as I also have mesothelioma.
I:9809;881;I recommend Bullitt to people who like violence and car chases.
I:9809;882;As happened in many of his roles, it's McQueen against the world.
I:9809;883;It hit the silver screen way back when and people fell in love almost immediately!
I:9809;884;Watching it present day, Bulitt still has the same effect!
I:9809;885;Recommended to all McQueen fans and movie buffs.
I:9809;886;It is memorable to be sure, but the movie, as a whole, is decent.
I:9809;887;Steve McQueen insisted that it be realistic and as a result you do get inside the character's heads.
I:9809;888;This is his star witness and the hearings will be his stage.
I:9809;889;There are enough twists and turns to keep you involved and, of course, there's the car chase.
I:9809;890;Roger Ebert likes it because the role of the stoic cop Bullitt is so close to the real Steve McQueen.
I:9809;891;I have watched all or parts of this movie many times and love it.
I:9809;892;One of the best detective/action movies of its time, still stands up as a fantastic movie over 40 years later.
I:9809;893;No question one of the best classic movies of all time.
I:9809;894;Steve McQueen at his best, just about as good as """"The Great Escape""""."""
895;This movie has the best automobile chase scene of all times using the coolest car Ford ever made.
896;He even looks good in dorky pajamas.
897;It is as good as I remembered.
898;Super COOL McQueen, and the chase seen is still thrilling.
899;Jacky Bissett was gorgeous in this film.
900;famous car chase on streets of San Francisco and criminial with a climat.
901;One of the original car chase movies that started it all!
902;One of the best car chase scenes of all time in movies or TV!
903;This movie has one of the best car chase scenes ever!
904;Its a fun movie to watch over and over again.
905;As usual, Steve McQueen is Mr. Cool.
906;The car chase is great.
907;This movie has a very high degree of realism.
908;I've loved it since it first came out.
909;this is the movie to see!
910;(I happen to think it is a great film)Bullitt is presented on a dual.
911;"I wondered myself, so I did some extensive Googling on that topic to educate myself about it)ON a scale of 1 to 5 the video is a strong solid 3.5 that occasionally goes into the ""4"" level especially with outdoor daylight scenes."
912;I found it to be more visually satisfying than my 1969 Planet of the Apes blu ray transfer but less satisfying than my 1971 Omega Man blu ray which I would rate as a solid 4 all the way.
913;the included extras are pretty good.
914;"The SD transfer of ""Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool "" is fine."
915;If you haven't seen it before on TCM it is well worth watching.
916;If you are a movie lover who is interested in the technical aspect of things, the entire show is interesting.
917;"The 1968 short film is called ""Steve McQueen's Commitment to Reality"" and I found it very interesting, especially after watching the film."
918;I am one of the very few who was unaware that McQueen did some of his own driving in this movie (although I now hear stunt driver Bud Elkins did the vast majority) and it was very cool hearing him explain how they prepared for those shots.
919;The whole thing has a squashed compressed sound that really detracts from the viewing experience if you have a dedicated home theater set.
920;sub standard audio aside, Bullitt on blu ray is very satisfying, offering a nice selection of very good special features, an above average visual presentation and one hell of a good movie!
921;it arrived promptly and in excellent condition .
922;we had a great time watching the famous car chase scene on Christmas day!
923;It just gets better and better each time I see it.
924;If you want to see a true classic, see this movie.
925;I recommend them as sellers.
926;An action movie with a decent plot.
927;even if Bullit take all precautions Mob's hit men succeed in wounding the witness and his guard.
928;"steve McQueen as Lt. Bullit gives one of his best characterizations, this is not little thing, considering his previous performances in ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960), ""The Great Escape"" (1963) and the remarkable ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1968)
I:9809;929;a very young and stylish Jacqueline Bisset fleshes Cathy, Bullit's fianc e"
930;Special mention must be done for Frank Keller editing awarded with an Oscar, William Fraker's cinematography and Argentinean Lalo Schifrin's musical score.
931;it is an extraordinary movie for all those interested in crime films and movie fans of every genre.
932;This tough police drama about protecting a witness in San Francisco was a star vehicle for Steve McQueen and contains one of the best car chases on film, a fine advertisement for the (real, i. e. 1960s) Ford Mustang (California yellow.
933;One of my best movies is Bullitt.
934;Steve Mcqueen is the number one star till this day.
935;If you look up the definition of cool there is a picture of this poster.
936;Iconic movie featuring one of the best car chases ever!
937;extra features on Steve McQueen were also very interesing as a look back at the man behind the persona.
938;the pleasant surprise was that despite this movie being filmed in the late 1960's, the blu.
939;I was please with the price and the shipping time.
940;this adds to the levelof suspicion in the film.
941;Also very noteworthy was the car chase on the streets of San Fransisco.
942;This will always stand as one of the great car chase scenes that you will ever see.
943;You alsohave some very good actors featured in this movie.
944;jacqueline Bissett,Robert Duvall and Robert Vaughn are very good in thismovie.
945;This is a very good movie.
946;Its a good movie that isn't just things blowing up because it looks awesome.
947;There is a pretty good story line where Steve Mcqueen isn't just a hero cop.
948;The quintessential car chase through the streets of San Francisco made the Mustang famous.
949;With Steve McQueen, and great action, what's not to like?
950;Best Car Chase Scene Ever!
951;This is the quintessential police drama, especially in San Fransisco.
952;Steve Mc Queen is the ultimate example of the dedicated policeman, despite private inhibiting influences, who does what he has to to find the guilty, and bring them to justice.
953;I do have to provide some background positive influence info.
954;Best night of our lives!
955;Featuring very attractice and stylish photography, the film is Steve McQueen's masterpiece.
956;good performances, Lalo Schiffrin's jazzy score, and the action combine for a crime classic.
957;I still think this contains the best car chase scene ever filmed.
958;There are plenty of insightful, reflective scenes that masterfully depict the inner conflicts of a homicide detective fighting not only the Mafia, but a crooked, politically motivated District Attorney, played consummately by a snide and patrician Robert Vaughn.
959;The beautiful Jacqueline Bisset adds her acting skills to boost the inner turmoil of McQueen's detective.
960;This thoughtful action film is a classic in which more is communicated with body language and close ups of characters' faces than with any trite dialogue.
961;it will never be this good in my lifetime.
962;great movie, i look forward to ordering more movies for my family and myself to watch.
963;thanks for the good deal
964;A classic that never gets old.
965;The perfect example of why McQueen was known as the King of Cool .
966;Worth the price just for the car chase scene.
967;I remember the movie as a teen and wanted my grandson to see the race seens, which I still believe are the best.
968;The chase sceene is the one that set the bar every movie after this one.
969;it wasn't a great movie but did have one of the best chase sceens in it and every one thinks so.
970;"I wondered how it held up after all these years
I:9809;971;Everything works perfectly, and even the sound during the chase scene adds to the thrills.
I:9809;972;Steve McQWueeen made his reputation in this, and I recommend it to all viewers.
I:9809;973;Bullitt is determined to find the killers, but the deeper he digs into the case, the more it seems there is more to it than meets the eye.
I:9809;974;hero that he was so good at here.
I:9809;975;William A. Fraker's stylish, fluid camerawork is also memorable.
I:9809;976;For a film with a measured pace and introverted characters, it has a lot of energy, because the camera, itself, is often on the move.
I:9809;977;inspired score by Lalo Schifrin adds to the 1960s cool.
I:9809;978;And Robert Duvall has a small role as a cabbie with a good memory.

980;disc set, showing how cool Steve McQueen really was.
981;the story, such that it is, has something to do with a mob accountant.
982;the point of this film is for Steve McQueen to be cool, as a cop, in very real surroundings.
983;"authenticity is the name of the game here, as each and every scene is filled with naturalistic flourishes, ""real""."
984;the hospital scenes, which I tend to be finicky about, were quite realistic and dramatic, except when Georg Stanford Brown spoke, playing a young surgeon.
985;ish source of all cinematic car chases, is done without music, lending extraordinary realism to it.
986;the supporting cast is filled with the people that film fanatics love to point out, like Mr. Roper.
987;jacqueline Bisset, here, is one of the five most beautiful women ever to be seen on film, or at least that's what I though whenever the camera lovingly showed her only wearing a man's button.
988;"the McQueen doc is a killer career overview
I:9809;989;overs, and the documentary of film editing should be required viewing for anybody who has ever watched a movie.
I:9809;990;fine and all, but the sound was kinda blah, with a lot of hissy background noise.
I:9809;991;Excellent film, Classic chase scene around the street's of San Francisco (spelling).
I:9809;992;Many people remember this for the ever.
I:9809;993;famous chase scene, which still is more impressive, and more realistic than most modern chases.
I:9809;994;For example, the camera shots are used to quite good effect.
I:9809;995;overall though, with nice style as I said, a decent plot, and McQueen, the movie is rather enjoyable.
I:9809;996;A classic of its kind from the 1960s.
I:9809;997;in the extras division, there is commentary by Peter Yates, as well as a good featurette from the time of filming that shows the making of the car chase (SD).
I:9809;998;Also in SD is the special bio feature Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool.
I:9809;999;I was reminded watching 2011's best movie """"Drive"""" of the similarities Ryan Gosling's character has with Steve McQueen's in """"Bullitt."""""""
1000;in one of the best car chase scenes in movie history, Bullitt realizes he is being followed by mob hit men.
1001;The scene holds up today.
1002;In a defining role, McQueen's Bullitt is the essence of cool.
1003;Like the car chase, the movie holds up today.
1004;disc special edition is the added features.
1005;"The second documentary is a very educational and informative ""The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing."""
1006;This doc is in high definition and Dolby Digital 5.1.
1007;Released in 2005, it is a well done inside look about the importance of the editor in filmmaking.
1008;Nearly every top director is also in the film giving their insights into the editor's role.
1009;This doc is a must for anyone really interested in how motion pictures are made.
1010;In addition snippets of some of the best movies ever made going back to the silent era are shown.
1011;ray by far but at times it was quite nice.
1012;The movie itself is one I can watch every year or so and totally enjoy.
1013;There was definitely a strong possibility to take that particular scene as classic as it is and to push even further with the techniques the crew had at the time to make the film even more true to life.
1014;All in all this is a classic film that deserves a second and third watch to appreciate it.
1015;this film is great and mcqueen is as tough as ever.
1016;"The car is clearly accelerating, yet we hear the ""double."
1017;"And speaking of comedy, any of the car chase action in ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" (1963) is more fun, more exciting, and more central to the plot."
1018;So the entertainment value in the Bullitt chase scene is just not there.
1019;the story: Nothing to see here, move along.
1020;"Most actors can't match his pure magnetism
I:9809;1021;But that is established at the outset.
I:9809;1022;And it is well bellow average by any standards today.
I:9809;1023;And the blu ray transfer is very impressive.
I:9809;1024;The car chase speaks for itself.
I:9809;1025;Overall, a nice statement for its time, but mainly for the atmosphere and vibe.
I:9809;1026;Bullit is an awsome movie that has become one of the top cult movies of all time right up there with Them,Gone in 60 Seconds and Attack of The Giant Leeches and besides it has the most famouse chase scene I think of all time sooooooooo get this movie
I:9809;1027;We highly recommend this two disc Special Edition.
I:9809;1028;interest on the part of Bullitt's bosses in the department, gets in his way, he goes right ahead, bucking authority.
I:9809;1029;Jacqueline Bisset is lovely as usual and is a fine plot point as well.
I:9809;1030;The soundtrack is very good.
I:9809;1031;The bass line at the beginning of the car chase gets you in the proper mood very well.
I:9809;1032;A fair piece of the credit for this film has to go to Don Gordon as Frank's partner, Delgetti.
I:9809;1033;cOM so it is okay for now.
I:9809;1034;When people think of this movie, the car chases are pretty much the only thing they think of, but Steve McQueen is excellent as a weary detective, and of course, the young Jacqueline Bisset is nice to look at.
I:9809;1035;Still, Bullitt is a good movie, and when I see it, it makes me still miss Steve McQueen.
I:9809;1036;It forced me to remember how much I loved this flick when it first came out.
I:9809;1037;The music, by Lalo Shifrin, is likewise superb.
I:9809;1038;done and did not detract from the entertaining experience.
I:9809;1039;This is a great film.
I:9809;1040;i't's an economical film, spare, spartan.
I:9809;1041;everyone in this film was great, but it has to be McQueen's best.
I:9809;1042;bullitt, a great film I hope to enjoy again and again.
I:9809;1043;Steve Mcqueen very good actor.
I:9809;1044;Thanks to you guys at Amazon.
I:9809;1045;This is as fine an example of a police/crime suspense thriller as I have ever seen.
I:9809;1046;director Peter Yates's cinematic techniques are fresh, innovative, and out of the box.
I:9809;1047;He mixes and melds them to a fast.
I:9809;1048;paced rhythm and injects an infusion of authentic, rock.
I:9809;1049;solid """"cool"""": the person of Steve McQueen as a tough police lieutenant who unflinchingly challenges authority in order to get the job done"
1050;"my favorite of Yates's techniques is what I call his ""cinema verite"" style."
1051;This gives the film further energy and a feeling of immediacy.
1052;My cousin loved it as a gift from me!
1053;This was always a good movie and mad a great gift for a man (boomer) who remembers it from the old days!
1054;The world moved both slower and faster back in the 1960's.
1055;That's what continues to make this film interesting all these years later.
1056;Cool never goes out of fashion and this movie remains amazingly watchable almost 40 years after it was made.
1057;Steve McQueen did better work than this in his tragically shortened career but this is one of the movies that helped make him a screen icon.
1058;Robert Vaughn lends great support as the oily politician keen to see the witness kepts safe .
1059;this is the movie that introduced me to one of the great loves of my life: the city of San Francisco and in my view, the city is indeed one of the iconic characters of this movie.
1060;Director Peter Yates does a great job of using the real urban setting to make more of the movie than the otherwise predictable script might have allowed.
1061;Jacqueline Bisset is gorgeous as Bullitt's typical 60s model.
1062;like girlfriend and there are notable appearances from the likes of a young Robert Duvall, Norman Fell and, especially interestingly from a black man's perspective, Georg Stanford Brown as the quiet but capable ER doctor.
1063;jumping car chase scene (for which Frank P Keller won a well.
1064;deserved Oscar for editing) is now legendary .
1065;and actually the most popular car chase in Hollywood history .
1066;Peter Yates crafted a film that is still being imitated today in 2014.
1067;It still keeps you locked on to the screen from beginning to end.
1068;love old cars the gt mustang and the rt charger are cool.
1069;I know this is considered a classic, but I personally did not like it.
1070;I thought it moved very slowly due to the minimal amount of action.
1071;"This film is famous for its car chase
I:9809;1072;this must be a classic from the classic!!
I:9809;1073;Great car chase, Steve Mcqueen is a super star.
I:9809;1074;This classic movie is one of Steve McQueen's best efforts, up there with The Great Escape and Papillon.
I:9809;1075;The car chase is legendary because McQueen did some of his own driving and the actor who was driving the Charger was REALLY driving it.
I:9809;1076;Steve McQueen is at his understated best in this classic police drama.
I:9809;1077;This belongs in everyone's collection.
I:9809;1078;Great actors, Lalo Shiffren music evokes the spirit of the times in San Fran pre summer of love.
I:9809;1079;This is a classic action film in every sense.
I:9809;1080;McQueen is at his best as tough guy cop Bullitt.
I:9809;1081;Steve McQueen and cast were wonderful in this movie.
I:9809;1082;Best car chase scene everBetween the Mustang, and The Charger !!!
I:9809;1083;It was such a pleasure to have the Blu Ray.
I:9809;1084;The picture is much improved.
I:9809;1085;That said it was a great flic and I recommend to anyone that wants to take a step back into the 1960's.
I:9809;1086;love the car chase in San Francisco.
I:9809;1087;I remember seeing it in the Cinema when it was first released and it just gets better!The car chase is the best that I have ever seen!
I:9809;1088;Just love the EXHAUST sound of the ,STANG.
I:9809;1089;Arguably the best crime film of 1968, and certainly one of the most influential films of the genre.
I:9809;1090;Bullitt established new directions in the mood and style of crime thrillers, and firmly established McQueen as one of the key anti.
I:9809;1091;In 1968 Steve was then riding high on the success of his previous heist film, """"The Thomas Crown Affair"""", and """"Bullitt"""" just propelled his star even higher into the cinematic heavens !"""
1092;The plot is tight, economical and well crafted.
1093;taciturn, moody Detective Frank Bullitt (McQueen) is charged with the protection of a key witness vital to an upcoming trial involving Mafia connections.
1094;producing a complex, intense crime thriller with a unique style that would ultimately influence many other films.
1095;Steve McQueen turns in one of his finest performances as a SF detective who bucks the system to get to the bottom of a complex case.
1096;A brief but strong appearance of Vic Tayback (pre Alice) as Pete Ross adds to the cast.
1097;The positioning of the cameras was ideal as it gave a sense of continuity.
1098;Even up Lombard St. It is by far the best car chase ever filmed.
1099;She can't understand how McQueen can live around such mayhem.
1100;Neither can I. i bought this movie as it is a film that can be viewed multiple times.
1101;It was easy to set up.
1102;McQueen is always watchable and this was one of his best.
1103;However there are not many, if any, actors today like Steve McQueen just for that and the greatest car chase in movie history this movie is worth own it and watching it.
1104;Good plot and great acting
1105;Great movie without all the weird, over the top special effects.
1106;Couple this with a great actor legion and you got a winner!Love it.
1107;1968's Bullitt is best known for its classic car chase scene that is still considered by many to the best of all time.
1108;Even without that memorable scene, Bullitt is a classic 60's film.
1109;Mr. McQueen's performance as steely police detective Frank Bullitt is one of his best and the forerunner of the anti.
1110;Fighting them at every turn is ruthless and ambitious senator Chalmers played with unctuous smarm by Robert Vaughan.
1111;Jacqueline Bissett co. stars in one of her first roles as Bullitt's girlfriend and Robert Duvall has a bit part as a cabbie.
1112;Director Peter Yates crafts a gritty look to the film and editor Frank Keller won the Academy Award for his superb work.
1113;Bullitt (1968), is a modern thriller, even 40 years later,incredibly, which is proof that skill, experience, professionalismand team work sometimes results in a timeless filming achievement.
1114;the actors are splendid in their maturity, professionalism,no.
1115;There is something for everyone in this work .
1116;Robert Duvall has a very brief spot as a cabdriver.
1117;McQueen was a wonderful actor and could authenticate any character he played.
1118;There are some wonderful late 60s scenes ( dress, food, advertisements) that is bound to be melancholic for many.
1119;The script is taut and you are hooked to the movie till the last scene.
1120;wonderful to see real American actors instead of effete mannequins who masquerade as actors these days.
1121;I love the classic car chase.
1122;The rest of the movie, I couldn't get into as much, but still enjoyed it.
1123;Definitely a great movie for it's time.
1124;IMO the plot was tight and well paced.
1125;Steve McQueen`s acting is brilliant, the directing was top shelf and the car chase was and still is the best I haves seen.
1126;Has the best chase scenes ever and great views of SF.
1127;"A rousing cheer of applause went up for Steve as he stood up and even in the public domain he seemed a little bashful but there he was in the flesh "" The King of Cool "" sitting with the public enjoying the Ed Sullivan's Sunday evening show."
1128;Our women got us into the plot and Steve's love life.
1129;As far as I'm concerned this movie holds the all time record for the best car chase ever in the history of Cinema , WHY ?
1130;The modern day word would be awesome , the best years of my life and this movie takes you back for a hair.
1131;rising ride as it really happened !
1132;Even today in the present times I watch the movie 4 or 5 times a year.
1133;"BUT Steve and the Mustang were the good guys , "" That's Hollywood "" !"
1134;A classic thriller with great car chases done without the aid of CGI.
1135;Plus it impressed me they could make turns that fast in cars without power steering!
1136;Was great in its time.
1137;The movie still holds up well after all these years.
1138;The car chase scene is great and my teen age kids enjoyed it.
1139;old favourites for which I've searching for years,thank you for comprehensive listings,I love road movies and these are 2 of the best
1140;Bullitt is considered by many to be Steve McQueen's best performance.
1141;It fits into that class of movies popular in the 1940's and 50's called Film Noir in which we see the darker and seedier sides of life.
1142;It's hard to come away from one of those movies feeling good about anything.
1143;"Just because you can call a movie part of the ""Film Noir"" genre doesn't automatically make it a good movie."
1144;The acting is terrific and I'm not just talking about McQueen.
1145;I don't know about you but I think I may have heard too much about it to really enjoy it the first time I saw it.
1146;Bullitt is not a work of art but it is a great movie.
1147;Unexpectedly really enjoyed this adventure / whodunit movie.
1148;Steve Mcqueen's character was smooth and cool.
1149;A classic 70's cop drama action/thriller with one of the best chase scenes ever filmed.
1150;Filmed in beautiful San Francisco too.
1151;I needed to see a classic action movie Which this was perfect.
1152;I recommend this to anyone who's looking for classic action movie.
1153;Steve McQueen's best movie in my opinion.
1154;The movie also has a very good plot and story line and there is much detective work involved although in todays world, no CIS would touch any evidence without surgical gloves on.
1155;All in all, still a great movie in todays world.
1156;Rewatching Bullit was nearly a great as seeing it the first time as a teenagers.
1157;The special segment on how the movie was made actually enhances appreciation for the movie.
1158;Great cars, great chase, good plot and unforgetable movie.
1159;Great stock footage of San Francisco, Great cars and a great car chase!!
1160;I Highly recommend this flick !!
1161;One of the best actors ever.
1162;Great movie visually, and that is what I wanted.
1163;The big chase scene is one of the best Hollywood has ever produced and without computer graphics .
1164;I remember seeing this when it first came to theaters.
1165;If all goes as planned, it promises to have a substantial effect of Chalmers' political career, as well.
1166;"It's a nice day and a long drive, so his girlfriend, Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) accompanies him
I:9809;1167;And before he can stop her, Cathy walks in on it.
I:9809;1168;She asks him how he can stand it, spending so much of his time in the gutter.
I:9809;1169;Written by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner (adapted from Robert L. Pike's novel, """"Mute Witness""""), the plot is fairly complex, and Yates keeps the tension high throughout."""
1170;McQueen did his own driving in this sequence, which is possibly the best ever filmed, and it set the standard for the entire industry ever since.
1171;"Gordon is well cast as Delgetti, perfectly complementing McQueen's Bullitt
I:9809;1172;Extremely well presented, with an intelligent script and a great cast, """"Bullitt"""" is one of McQueen's best, and one you do not want to miss."""
1173;This is the classic Bullit movie with the first really awesome car chase sequence ever.
1174;It's also a pretty good movie even today.
1175;Few people who see this movie for the first time understand the profound impact it had when it came out.
1176;While modern day crime dramas are filled with gratuitous, numbing violence, the reality of this movie was a real breakthrough.
1177;The famous car chase may be the thiing that brings people back to Bullitt but the gritty realism is what makes this a classic.
1178;There is also the fine performance of Robert Vaughn as a politician whose murdered star witness was his mealticket.
1179;I even like the quiet times when he is at a restaurant and picking up his girl at her work.
1180;i especially like the casting of the hit men.
1181;Steve McQueen was great in this movie.
1182;There were some great chase scenes in San Francisco.
1183;It was fun to watch.
1184;if you love a good old fashioned car chase movie through the city streets, this is the movie for you!
1185;Great cop movie from back in the day
1186;This action film stars: Robert Vaughn, Jaqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Simon Oakland, Norman Fell, plus others.
1187;I would recommend this to anyone who likes Steve McQueen or likes action films or any fans of these stars.
1188;All the way, the best chase scene in motion pictures.
1189;By the way, if you have your video system is going thru your hifi, the chase scene is a full.
1190;Great shots of San Fran, incredibly young and sexy Jacqueline Bisset, and off the charts chase scenes, how could you go wrong?!
1191;Good acting and plenty of action.
1192;Bullitt (Peter Yates, 1968)Forty years after its release, Bullitt is remembered as having the best car chase in film history, running almost ten minutes and setting the stage for many of the car chases (and parodies, such as the wonderful remote.
1193;But man, what a car chase.
1194;That's pretty much all you need to know about the plot, which is paper.
1195;Which is worth noting if you're a Bisset fan.
1196;McQueen glowers, Vaughn oozes a trail of nastiness, and a cadre of Hollywood's sixties and seventies best (including Robert Duvall, Norman Fell, Simon Oakland, Vic Tayback, and many, many others) play up.
1197;But hey, it's an action movie.
1198;One of the best car chase films ever yes older but the action and driving is not like today makes you feel like your in the drivers seat and the classic muscle cars its american all the way.
1199;Amazingly, this replacement is EXACTLY like the original.
1200;I am so happy to find one of my favorites once again.
1201;It is a classic, and one of the very first true classic car chase movies ever filmed.
1202;Saw this when it first came out and watch it occasionally.
1203;A classic Steve McQueen told in the style of that era.
1204;A retro look at film making in the 60 s.
1205;So much to see and appreciate.
1206;BULLITT is today an easy film to underrate, partly because so many films in the seventies embraced a similar narrative and visual style.
1207;The whole film is, in fact, a technical delight, with everyone trying to remake as many rules as possible.
1208;the film is most famous, of course, for what is quite probably the greatest car chase in movie history.
1209;There have been dozens of chase scenes since then that are more spectacular in their stunts and effects, so what makes this one remain so compelling?
1210;It builds beautifully, first with two hit men in their Dodge Charger trailing Bullitt in his Mustang, then their losing him, only to rediscover him in their rearview mirror.
1211;Although they are at this point at normal speeds, the effect if riveting, and when the driver of the charger takes a moment to put on his seatbelt, you know you are in for something special.
1212;But what really makes this car scene extraordinary is the devotion to realism.
1213;Also, the speeds are simply incredible.
1214;There are reports that the two cars in this one often exceeded 110 mph.
1215;this is rightfully regarded as one Steven McQueen's best films, if not his best.
1216;For me it is one of the only misfires in an otherwise superb film.
1217;This is my favorite McQueen film because from beginning to end, he remains in character as Frank Bullitt, a taciturn but thorough police detective in San Francisco who relentlessly solves not one but several crimes.
1218;All of the supporting cast's performances are outstanding, notably those of Robert Vaughn (Walter Chalmers), Norman Fell (Baker), Don Ross (Delgetti) and Simon Oakland (Captain Bennett).
1219;The film is based on Robert L. Pike's novel Mute Witness.
1220;This film has Snap, Crackle, and Pop.
1221;Great old cars, soundtrack, a plot with enough complexity that you have to pay attention.
1222;oh, and it has a really great car chase.
1223;the film is distinguished by a splendid car chase through the streets of San Francisco, with Detective Bullitt in a Mustang, chasing the baddies in their sedan.
1224;The movie should be seperated into 2 parts, the actual movie and the historical car chase scene.
1225;The fastback Mustang it worth watching the movie for, but when you sit down and watch it you also have to gasp at how good the story and the performance of the actors.
1226;I love almost everything about this movie.
1227;"Much better than the old ""Dirty Harry"" movies of the same vintage."
1228;For another, each moment is packed with interesting characters and new plot developments.
1229;"One of my favorite ""guy/car"" movies."
1230;"Bullitt is a rare and complex film
I:9809;1231;But what we get is a thoughtful sensitive character study of a laconic, yet complex man"
1232;"there's also a little remarked but very subtle mood change that occurs
I:9809;1233;the mood is sombre and serious.
I:9809;1234;You'll watch it many times, and find plenty to enjoy and ponder each time.
I:9809;1235;He was the and remainsthe man and this film is Steve at his best, playing a role heresisted playing for a long time.
I:9809;1236;Thecar chase is terrific but it's McQueen's movie and his subdued,coiled.
I:9809;1237;spring performance makes it watchable over and overagain.
I:9809;1238;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9809;1239;The car chase scene in San Francisco was one the best early chase scenes,and still is.
I:9809;1240;I thought the movie was pretty good for an old flic.
I:9809;1241;Great car chase with lots of action.
I:9809;1242;This movie has great acting, lots of action and one of the best car chases ever filmed!
I:9809;1243;Great cars in movie ,son love it he has a friend who has the bullet ,son he enjoyed the movie
I:9809;1244;There was plenty of action and the car.
I:9809;1245;my favorite part of the movie was the car chase, which is without a doubt the best car thriller Ive ever experienced, a fast paced scene that I truly enjoyed.
I:9809;1246;the colors and sound were good and I would have expected more car chases but overall the movie was a four star hit this movie is pretty good, check it out!!!
I:9809;1247;ranking official with fearsome clout, has hand.
I:9809;1248;clock protection of a star witness in an upcoming senate hearing.
I:9809;1249;Bullitt is clearly concerned about a possible hit.
I:9809;1250;naturally, there's a hit on """"Ross."""""""
1251;One of Bullitt's team, a young family man, is severely injured.
1252;"Before he gets blasted with the hitman's Winchester pump, ""Ross"" blurts his last words: ""He TOLD me."
1253;"He would have spirited ""Ross"" to a secure location known only to his team."
1254;quickening chases and mesmerizing visuals have garnered the movie a small but devoted following.
1255;At this point in his career he had extensive creative control (not always a good thing).
1256;McQueen saw himself as an important actor, a film artist, and a leading man in the old Hollywood mold.
1257;Now that you know where my house it, I hope we'll get to see more of each other.
1258;Cathy, meanwhile, finds Bullitt a refreshing antidote to her artsy.
1259;Bullitt is a REAL MAN who can fulfill her sophisticated needs.
1260;Whereupon he treats her to a good lay to keep her focused the true basis of their affair.
1261;mcQueen fought to have Bullitt shot entirely on location, a rarity in 1968.
1262;It's a splendid document of San Francisco of the era.
1263;Bullitt meets an informant at the now.
1264;shrouded Golden Gate in the background.
1265;The hospital and airport sequences, with their documentary realism, are endlessly fascinating.
1266;idiosyncratic touches keep things interesting.
1267;The Mustang makes a quick right on York and zooms up the hill.
1268;The sequence has to bring a tingle to the back of your neck.
1269;Bullitt is obviously cool with the brothers.
1270;(The disgraced and discredited Amos 'n' Andy, one of the most popular comedy shows of the '50s, with its all.
1271;In a sensational scene, Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) an African.
1272;In the bathroom, he gazes at himself in the mirror with a look of sober self.
1273;Steve McQueen, this is a classic a classic a classic and a classic.
1274;loved it , thank you very much Amazon!
1275;One found it a puzzle from beginning to end.
1276;It jumped from one sequence to another seemingly without connection.
1277;I picked this up for the car chase, but really enjoyed the movie.
1278;Good car chase scene through San Francisco, action and suspense.
1279;Good movie to add to a collection too for the price.
1280;, but it played just fine.
1281;The chase scenes in autos has to be one of the best in movies.
1282;The deception played on the officials over the death of the so called witness was enjoyable.
1283;epic race scenesPretty much sums it up.
1284;the chase scene through San Francisco is great.
1285;Great movie from start to finish.
1286;Great plot, great acting and cast (McQueen, Bisset, Vaughn), great action.
1287;ray its worth the price.
1288;arrived in very good condition,get it!
1289;Really a classic, loved it.
1290;great car chases, nicely shot in san francisco, good ladies.
1291;steve mcqeen is a class act
1292;Bullit remains one of the great movies.
1293;Tight script, excellent acting, and the best car chase ever.
1294;This movie has the best car chases and is full of action.
1295;This one will also keep you on your toes and is a great classic.
1296;Got it for my man, he loved it.
1297;One has to remember that action movies and scenes during the 1960s were a far cry from the standard that we are exposed to, today.
1298;I did enjoy seeing the style of the late 1960's through this movie and it makes you want to experience it.
1299;it made for a very happy guy
1300;This movie had a lot of action, suspense, and a chase scene on the streets of San Francisco that was exciting and impressive knowing there were no computer graphics used in movies of this time period.
1301;It is more of a guys' movie, I think.
1302;There isn't as much captivating dialogue as there is intrigue.
1303;There's a lot of good guy/bad guy action and interaction.
1304;A gritty, intense, all stripped.
1305;For a nearly fifty year old movie, this one is still fun to watch.
1306;Steve McQueen might have been a misogynistic womanizer but he was a master of the minimalist style of acting and his image is the personification of 'cool'.
1307;It's fun to revisit the world of late '60's America (safe from the War and civil unrest anyway), and see how we lived then.
1308;The chase scene is still arguably the best ever filmed.
1309;This film demonstrates to contemporary Hollywood just how to make a superb thriller without having an explosion every 5 minutes.
1310;You know its a classic from the opening shot.
1311;Robert Vaughn, who I've always liked, but never really rated as an actor, is excellent here as Walter Charmers (who is anything but charming!)
1312;The scenes between him and McQueen are riveting.
1313;Theres the famous car chase of course, which is great, but watching it again recently, the thing that struck me was the completely realistic Hospital scenes.
1314;He claimed the car chase in it was the best in movies ever.
1315;"At the end I found myself asking ""What did I just watch??"""
1316;A favorite for my library and any library who likes car chases with the likes of Steve McQueen and a Mustang!
1317;I watched this on my day off just to get reacquainted with it, amazing.
1318;One of the best chase scenes ever filmed.
1319;wow what a chase scene the schreeches the jumps the skids this movie has it all with the chase scene.
1320;All i ever do is jump right to the chase scene anyways.
1321;When I mention to people that Bullitt is one of my favorite movies, the common response is, Oh, you mean the one with the Mustang and the car chase, right?
1322;I think that more importantly, it has a very complex plot.
1323;In an age when theaters are overrun by cheesy Steven Seagal movies with comical plots, Bullitt is an intelligent action flick.
1324;The various twists and character development make for a movie that is worthy of repeated viewing.
1325;Additionally, good acting separates the keepers from the rejects when we are forced to sit through the likes of Chuck Norris and others.
1326;Of course, the car chase is what Bullitt is infamous for, but just keep in mind that the rest of the movie has other qualities as well.
1327;so he got HIS chase.
1328;higly recommend for those who love classic cars.
1329;he was so excited when he received it.
1330;"often, the ""great"" movies of my youth turn out to be ""I really thot this was GOOD??!!?"""
1331;telephones, teletexts, thoroughbred racing cars, medical equipment, airplanes, brick buildings, and firearms.
1332;But back in the day, this is what good film making was all about.
1333;a lot of people love this movie for the car chase scene midway through San Francisco, Livermore and beyond.
1334;But the layers of this film are vasty and dimensional and go beyond an early homage to John Frankenheimer.
1335;The first act centers around the assignment, the lieutenant's girl and his life and how it interferes and intersects with his career.
1336;Speaks volumes about some of the things that occurred in that area and legal history in those same years.
1337;One of the more interesting moments within the conclusion is a scene where our man Steve shoots a `perp' through a set of plate glass automatic doors.
1338;also worth mentioning is that there is strangely a certain amount of same.
1339;I can imagine the late Hal Ashby being a fan of this film.
1340;It definitely raised the bar in many aspects.
1341;i will say that the movie looks beautifully restored in Blue.
1342;ray and the audio is balanced and dynamic.
1343;SeeingBullittin this condition brings a renewed sense of awe to the film that could've very easily been missed during previous viewings .
1344;This movie has one of the best car chase scenes ever.
1345;The blu ray transfer was done really well.
1346;Best Steve McQueen movie of all time.
1347;great scenes of older San Francisco.
1348;Nostalgic but still a classic!
1349;"This is what San Francisco Detective Lieutenant's Frank Bullitt's (the King of Cool,"" the legendary Steve McQueen, 1930 to 1980) girlfriend Cathy (the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset) says to him."
1350;"As well, this quotation pretty well sums up the entire movie (based on the 1963 novel ""Mute Witness"" by Robert L. Pike) as the viewer is given a glimpse into Bullitt's world."
1351;"on this particular assignment, Bullitt has to protect (""baby sit"") a star witness for an important trial."
1352;He was specifically requested for this routine assignment by the ambitious public prosecutor Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn, who has said that this is his best movie role).
1353;An officer in the hospital.
1354;A feature of this movie is the car chase or the high.
1355;The story presented is quite good.
1356;It is very realistic (for that time period) presenting to.
1357;the story itself is quite good.
1358;It has many twists and turns.
1359;a note of caution here.
1360;If you think about what you have seen, you can easily answer these questions for yourself.
1361;the acting is in a word: fantastic.
1362;Robert Vaughn does a good job of portraying the ambitious Chalmers against McQueen's low.
1363;I also liked Simon Oakland's portrayal of the police captain.
1364;For example, Robert Duvall has a small part as a taxi driver.
1365;i also enjoyed the sharp, sparse dialogue.
1366;There is also jazzy background music (that is most effective in the opening sequence).
1367;It has the movie in full screen on one side and wide screen on the other.
1368;There are also some interesting extras.
1369;"in conclusion, this is an unforgettable movie starring the legendary Steve McQueen, ""The King of Cool."""
1370;As great as McQueen is in it, he was the only actor who was awake during the filming.
1371;I have watched Bullitt at least 8 times and love it each time.
1372;It never gets old and McQueen is great.
1373;Steve McQueen is wonderful in this movie.
1374;It has drama, tremendous excitement, and the coolest anti.
1375;I will admit the plot is never clearly explained, but the story is so entertaining you forget about it.
1376;very good movie a lot of good chase scenes Steve McQueen does a good job like you always does well worth the money
1377;chase in Hollywood history, this is a must have for guys to add to their home library.
1378;I was told to watch for the Movie again and when I see it, to go ahead and order it.
1379;So I ordered it for the third time yesterday .
1380;This is a good movie with cool cars and one of the best chase scenes on film.
1381;"steve McQueen, however, is at his absolute ""Cool"" best!"
1382;"I firmly believe the car chase in ""Bullitt"" is the finest ever filmed, and a wide."
1383;screen format is a must for anyone wanting to experience what movie.
1384;"This car chase allows ""Bullitt"" to essentially have two climaxes, and both will keep you glued to your seat."
1385;This is a good movie specially if you enjoy a good car chase.
1386;Steve Mcqueen does a great job in this movie.
1387;i watch the movie yearly and recommend it to any cops and robbers fan.
1388;This is the movie that prompted me to move to San Francisco.
1389;If you live in San Francisco it's especially fun to try to identify local streets.
1390;Jacquline Bisset is stunningly beautiful and Rober Vaughn is the guy to hate.
1391;This is a classic movie with Steve McQueen which many people will find boring, but if you're a fan of any Clint Eastwood style film you'll enjoy this.
1392;It's kind of a slow pace, but the film is highly detailed to represent things as they are in the real world.
1393;It also features one of the greatest, and probably the first great car chase scenes in movie history through the streets and hills of San Francisco.
1394;This was a great movie with a great story line.
1395;This is one of the top 100 movies to own.
1396;Have always enjoyed Steve McQueen.
1397;This was one of my favorites.
1398;Thanks for keeping up with the Steve McQueen movies.
1399;I love the nostalgic feeling when watching them!
1400;I've seen in a few jillions times and still love it.
1401;The 11+ minute chase scene is one of the best in movie history and I'm not the only one that feels that way .
1402;Do yourself a favor and watch it.
1403;Oh and it doesn't rely on computer graphics to move the story along or even provide a story, it's cinema at its best.
1404;I bought this as a gift for some one else.
1405;Has to be the number one classic car chase of all time, and the one that set the standard for all later movies.
1406;This is my Husband's favorite movie.
1407;I highly recommend this movie if you have a car guy in your life with a passion for the classics.
1408;Awesome movie, Steve McQueen great.
1409;one of the best car chases ever.
1410;Love the lean, spare dialog, camera work and editing are wonderful.
1411;Movie from 70'su with action and solid story line.
1412;I would recommend to a friends and family whom like action with good plot and surprises.
1413;Just saw this in the last month, and it has held up pretty good over the years.
1414;cool detective,laconic icon of cool.
1415;he makes you realize how the big stars acted with their eyes,their body language,creating a myth and acting within their own image.
1416;this film took McQueen into superstar status.
1417;his eyes as blue as the bluest of blue skies,with a jazzy soundtrack playing in the background.
1418;think of McQueen and you think of The Magnificent Seven,The Cincinnati Kid,The Great Escape,The Getaway,The Thomas Crown Affair,The Sandpebbles.
1419;seeing this film decades after I first saw it makes me realize how unforgettable it is.
1420;I am a big Steve McQueen fan and this movie is on of his best.
1421;The chase scenes thru the streets on San Francisco are incredible.
1422;He was an amazing actor who never got credit for his blue eyes.
1423;It was a good movie!
1424;And the best car chase ever put on film (sorry, Seven Ups).
1425;Watching this again many years after it was originally released was still fun.
1426;Exciting story and the car chase scenes in San Francisco are great.
1427;I just waited to see the car chase.
1428;Seeing it now, Especially being a San Franciscan, Made it a real Classic.
1429;The best part besides the chase is the cinematography and Dialog.
1430;It's nice when a film tells a story quietly and Steve Ma Queen is King.
1431;See it on a Big Screen
1432;Clint may have some good zinging oneliners, but McQueen is the eptiome of cool.
1433;in the famous ( and still the best ) car chase, he hardlyseems concerned.
1434;His scenes with Robert Vaughn as the oilyDA are great.
1435;which is another great movie, btw.
1436;"this movie establishes what made McQueen one of the finest actors of his time, and hands down why he shares the ""Man's Man"" crown with Clint Eastwood."
1437;mcQueen always played characters with such minimalism.
1438;Bullitt is Steve McQueen at his finest!
1439;"It's an excellent movie with an excellent cast, a great plot, top notch acting, and the ""Greatest"" chase scene ever filmed."
1440;Two of the most powerful street cars of the 1960's (1968 GT 390 Mustang Fastback, and a 1968 Dodge Charger) battled it out on the streets of San Francisco!
1441;If you have a big screen TV you'll enjoy feeling yourself move in your seat with the cars as they race down the hills of frisco.
1442;The racing was real, the crashing was real, the explosions were real, and yes .
1443;One of the greatest of the hard.
1444;The movie Bullitt has the absolute best car chase ever filmed.
1445;As this movie is one of my all time favorite detective/murder stories, I had to see it Blu.
1446;It has a great story line with a great cast.
1447;Both the hospital and car chase scenes are the best!
1448;mcQueen in front of a camera is almost always magic.
1449;"His outtakes are better than most of today's ""stars"" Oscar performances."
1450;The second disc takes you behind the scenes, and you get to see the actors' relationships off camera.
1451;"the famous ""chase scene"" holds up well after 40 years."
1452;"It has more soul than all the digitally inhanced ""fast and the furious"" movies put together."
1453;Perhaps the most significant release of these collections is Bullitt (Two Disc Special Edition) an all time favorite among fans of McQueen and 70's era police dramas.
1454;The film boasts a fine cast with Jacqueline Bisset as the cultured girl friend to McQueen and Simon Oakland as the beleaguered police captain.
1455;Bullitt is perhaps best remembered for the high octane car chase scene that skidded through the streets of San Francisco.
1456;On the special edition release the set up of the car chase is well chronicled by the stuntmen who worked with McQueen in one of the behind the scenes documentaries that are included.
1457;Ronin (Robert DeNiro) is pretty good.
1458;But Bullitt is the best, gritty and real.
1459;It still has THE best chase footage.
1460;It's an intergral part of the story line, unlike most movies now that include chase seens out of habit.
1461;Steve McQueen is subtle and brilliant.
1462;that have added to it's mystique over the last 32 years.
1463;One of the great early car chase scenes in motion pictures and the Amazon video feed freezes, telling us to wait while it loads.
1464;ray upcoding of this 1968 movie is excellent.
1465;The chase scene is still awesome.
1466;This is a 'must have' for all Bullitt movie buffs!
1467;Quintessential period piece with Steve McQueen at his manliest.
1468;But for its time, a top notch thriller.
1469;The car chase is a classic featuring McQueen's Mustang fastback which he drove himself throughout the film, a scene which stands up to today's standards.
1470;Robert Vaughn is perfect as the pissed.
1471;Worth watching on Netflix or cable.
1472;While at times the plot can be confusing, it is almost secondary to the movie's impeccable style.
1473;It is simply a cool movie to watch.
1474;Plenty of great action/stunts with the famous car chase through the streets of San Francisco and Bullitt's chase through an airport.
1475;With great performances all around, a perfect Lalo Schifrin score, and the famous chase, Bullitt is a must have for movie fans.
1476;steve McQueen gives one of his best performances as Lt. Frank Bullitt, the officer placed in charge of keeping a witness alive.
1477;Bullitt is McQueen at his best as the strong, silent cop who will stop at nothing to bring his man in.
1478;Robert Vaughn is perfectly slimey as Walter Chalmers, the politician who needs Bullitt's witness to testify at an upcoming trial.
1479;Jacqueline Bisset gives a great supporting performance as Cathy, Bullitt's girlfriend who begins to wonder if he has become numb to the world around him.
1480;Don Gordon is also very good as Delgetti, Bullitt's partner and loyal sidekick.
1481;The movie also stars Simon Oakland, Robert Duvall, and Norman Fell.
1482;disc Special Edition is great for fans of the movie.
1483;Disc One features a cleaned.
1484;up looking widescreen presentation of the movie, a commentary track from director Peter Yates, and a theatrical trailer.
1485;"Disc Two offers ""Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool,"" a great 90."
1486;Glad to have this movie in my collection, saw part of it the other night and had to order it, They are right the chase scene is a classic
1487;including the famous car chase .
1488;McQueen has the charisma of a sack of doorknobs.
1489;and about that car chase: BORING!
1490;I can't even imagine it being of interest to 1968 audiences, when such extended car chases were still novelties, and for audiences of today .
1491;If you want to see a real car chase, watch Ronin.
1492;I have watched this several times over the years, and it is a very good movie.
1493;The story is well told.
1494;Robert Vaughn did a very good acting job as the smarmy, ambitious and unlikeable DA.
1495;Awesome movie cult classic at its best!!!
1496;This is a great movie because Steve McQueen is a cool as he's ever been, the sunshine and light is as nice as it comes in SF, and the cars are as tough and politically incorrect as they come.
1497;Anybody with the slightest interest in cars will enjoy the scene, and it is close to Nirvana on Earth for those with a heart for sixties muscle cars and thundering V8's.
1498;Click on the link and order a copy today!
1499;A beautifully constructed star vehicle for Steve McQueen at his best, it's pretty much the prototype for every Hollywood cop movie that followed, but benefits from good casting (Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Simon Oakland, Robert Duvall), better characterisation than the norm and a low key approach from director Peter Yates that makes the highs seem a lot more effective than they should.
1500;The plot's not bad either, with Lalo Schifrin contributing a cool score and Pablo Ferra a terrific main title sequence.
1501;disc set certainly boasts an improved transfer over the original single.
1502;Steve McQueen does it the best, excellent movie.
1503;Hollywood's tough guys hopefully, all take notes from the master.
1504;Great story line and an excellent cast.
1505;The bit part cab driver role was played by Robert Duvall.
1506;the famous car chase in the streets of San Francisco was fantastic, with the hot Mustang and the Dodge R/T.
1507;Regardless, this is a must see classic.
1508;This movie has the best chase seen ever made, taking place on the streets of San Fransisco.
1509;No bad language or nudity, it's just great entertainment.
1510;It is one of Steve's best for action and reaction.
1511;A very good police story that happened in my favorite city,San Francisco!!!!!
1512;"car chase sequence for which ""Bullitt"" is famous."
1513;Cutting the scenes with girlfriend Jacqueline Bisset would actually improve matters.
1514;cGI car chase is genuinely gripping.
1515;"Bullitt isn't boring, but maybe it's best that we recall these ""classics"" without actually rewatching them."
1516;It's an excellent and entertaining review of who is really responsible for scenes that move or excite us in the movies: the film editor.
1517;The Cutting Edge has had a theatrical release and is also available separately, so it's a real coup to discover it among the self.
1518;In a genre that is now formula, special effects and graphic violence, this film uses a good script, great acting and fine directing to accomplish a story that still manages to entertain.
1519;One of the first of a long line of cops versus politicians and crime movies it's still one of the best.
1520;mcQueen struggles with both the criminals and the bureaucracy in his search for the killers of one of his fellow cops.
1521;of course Bullitt contains one of the great car chase sequences in modern film.
1522;Without the use of special effects or expensive tricks, the scene is complicated and simple.
1523;the excellent cast includes Steve McQueen, Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Vaughn.
1524;This is probably Peter Yates, who directed The Dresser and Eyewitness, best work.
1525;If you loved The Great Escape and Papillon, with Steve McQueen as the king of the escape artists and chase scenes, then you will love Bullitt.
1526;It features one of the most famous and exciting car chase sequences ever filmed.
1527;I had seen it when it came out and enjoyed it so much.
1528;My son's thank you was bursting with appreciation.
1529;He loves this action packed movie.
1530;Another plus is we are from San Francisco and it's fun to see how it looked then.
1531;Bulitt is undoubtedly a landmark film including three slick and impressionable ingredients of the late 60s: star power with presence, a widely imitated car chase in the hilly streets of San Francisco, and a highly stylistic approach to cinematography and music.
1532;Whether you like the movie is one thing but the aforementioned ingredients successfully make you remember it.
1533;It works for the movie.
1534;"The now infamous car chase has been imitated in one of the last ""Dirty Harry"" movies and in 1995's ""Jade"" as well as other movies."
1535;"the screenplay for ""Bulitt"" serves its intended purpose but it is really propelled by the good direction, acting, and Lalo Schifrin's memorable musical score."
1536;Watch this movie and you won't regret it.
1537;I was about to give 5 stars to this movie and to say it's the best thriller I've ever seen, but.
1538;the script is average at best, the cast is good but nothing spectacular, except McQueen, who doesn't really perform much, one has to admit.
1539;Yes, he looks great for this role, but the role does not require much more than good looks.
1540;so what's so great about this film?
1541;Especially camerawork, late Technicolor age obsession with color, perfect eye for the detail, street scene, so much mid.60's spirit in everything on screen .
1542;"Strangely, it brought to my mind ""The Blast of Silence"", the 1961 noir by Allen Baron."
1543;Surely McQueen is much more modern than Baron (who directed the film and played Frank Bono, the main character), but there's something about the two movies which brings them together for me, maybe zeitgeist captured with such a great skill and attention to detail.
1544;the Getaway is just entertainment.
1545;Better than any of the new movies.
1546;would recommend to anyone that likes mcQueen.
1547;this very gritty action film .
1548;life detective Dave Toschi (Zodiac Killings) and Robert L. Pike's novel, Mute Witness .
1549;breaking in its day, and is noted for having the most famous car chase of all time.
1550;He's still behind the wheel quite a bit.
1551;You'll hear some terrific 60s music when they go out on the town.
1552;Bullitt won the Oscar for Best Film Editing and was nominated for Best Sound.
1553;It also won other prestigious awards for its cinematography and script, as well as for its editing and sound.
1554;McQueen considered this his best performance, and his favorite of all his films.
1555;Rated PG, but still very edgy.
1556;Still the best car chase, ironically because there are minimal special effects.
1557;Compare the extraordinary car chases of the Bourne movies.
1558;Wild as they are, the sheer fantasy of them detracts from our emotional engagement in the film.
1559;The king of cool, a good detective story and late 60's era muscle cars in one of the greatest car chases on film.
1560;Bullitt and Steve McQueen still deliver the goods even 45 years after it's release.
1561;The script is tight and authentic.
1562;The cast and acting are genuine and believable.
1563;ray transfer is sharp making the film look as if it could have been done today.
1564;it's just as enjoyable as ever and the chase scene is still one of cinema's best.
1565;My heart still races when I see an old Mustang or Charger.
1566;Worth watching over a few times if U like cars.
1567;Good 4 kids and geasers alike.
1568;i like steve mcqueen movies hes was a very good actor.
1569;did some great movies in his time acting great actor in his time
1570;Steve McQueen and cast deliver on a terrific storyline for this movie!
1571;The chase seen, in these muscle cars, is fantastic!
1572;with Bullit being one of his best along with The Great Escape.
1573;Car chase scene was as good as it realistically gets.
1574;Knowing todays airport security the scenes at the airport are laughafable but still entertaining.
1575;Just got the Smart TV in December and this was the first movie I had tried to stream .
1576;This movie not only has a good story, it has the Greatest Auto Chase of all time.
1577;holds up well as time goes by, THE CAR CHASE is always a highlight, as are seeing San Francisco back then.
1578;real cars on real roads at real speeds going real fast and with the very occasional real star behind the wheel (Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, James Garner).
1579;He was a real motor cycle racer .
1580;he also raced a Porsche 917 at Le Mans and made the movie Le Mans which is the best racing movie ever made (Grand Prix with James Garner the second best.
1581;The best scene in the chase sequence has Steve missing a turn up a hill and smoking the tire (as apposed to tires .
1582;"The director wisely kept the ""mistake"" in the film and it is maybe the best part of the chase scene."
1583;Hmm that is OK though .
1584;His best line from Le Mans.
1585;To men who do it well, racing is life, everything else is just waiting.
1586;Enjoyed it in Blue ray.
1587;The car chase was great.
1588;The price was very reasonable.
1589;Great cast and plenty of action.
1590;Steve Mcqueen is the coolest of the cool.
1591;acting acting style he conveys his character very nicely.
1592;Good story, great period clothing, and the car chase that set the standard for all to follow.
1593;This movie is an excellent movie, it filled with suspense and the car chase scene is the best I've ever seen even by today's standard.
1594;The sound track is very darn good too, even though it this film was shot in the late 60s (1968 to be exact) they did a very good job of remastering the sound track.
1595;Awesome movie and well worth the time.
1596;This is obviously one of the famous SM movies.
1597;I've seen it numerous times over the years.
1598;Wish it had more action sequences, but still outstanding!
1599;Great movie, lots of well known actors today just starting to get exposure.
1600;Suspense is very well done.
1601;Of the action stars of this era of film, Steve McQueen was always on top of his game as an actor.
1602;Bullitt demonstrates his top acting skills, and delivers a great story.
1603;This movie is one of the all time great classic's.
1604;This is considered a classic thriller.
1605;I watched this movie when I was a kid and I loved it.
1606;I missed it years ago, but it was really really worth the wait!!!
1607;Great car chase scenes, McQueen did some real good driving,plus this sold a lot of Ford Mustangs and Dodge Chargers.
1608;The story line is interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention and there are some other terrific actors besides McQueen in the movie too (Vaughn and Duvall).
1609;You'll want to watch it again!
1610;roar them engines, pump up the testosterone and fasten your friggin' seat belts for one of the best chase scenes ever done on film, per.
1611;thank goodness I did because I absolutely loved it.
1612;Bullitt is a great movie and is (or WAS if there's been a more recent one that I don't know of) reputed to contain the best car chase scene ever.
1613;Like the chases on Rockford Files, but longer, and nice and wild.
1614;I think they should experience the old greats among stars, such as McQueen, Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson, and so many others, at least as a basis for comparison with the stars of today.
1615;Just a good plot, and good acting.
