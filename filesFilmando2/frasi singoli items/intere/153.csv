id;spiegazione
1;A great guy film and the jokes about adverbs had my wife rolling (she's a teacher).
2;Complex characters with realistic motives.
3;This is one of my favorites.
4;It may have started as a B movie in theatres, but every actor and actress in this movie delivers a dynamic pperformance.
5;It's one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen.
6;Although the plot involves a string of murders, they are lighthearted and funny (if murder could ever be funny) in a twisted sort of way.
7;Val Kilmar and Robert Downey Jr. have excellent rapport together, and Michelle Monihan is credible as the out.
8;reach dream girl (with a twist).
9;An incredible movie to say the least.
10;Humor, suspense, and a little action for taste.
11;The movie has all star performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.
12;The story tells a rather good tale about three characters.
13;What makes the story so good is the great chemistry between these three actors and the comedy that ensues.
14;Shane Black knows how to make a great mystery with comedy since his name is best known for Lethal Weapon.
15;ray version was well worth it.
16;The picture was vibrant and filled with life.
17;The sound was great on my speakers.
18;An excellent movie for a great price.
19;This is now one of my favorite movies.
20;imagining of the Los Angeles noir film, a modern day spoof of the hard.
21;the film is gorgeously shot and the production design unsurpassed .
22;Robert Downey Jr. is indeed a great actor and here he looks hotter than ever, and while his character is momentarily fun, after a while, his voice over narration and silly antics just become irritating.
23;los Angeles viewers will certainly get a kick out of some of the stunning location work .
24;Indeed it has a cuteness and hippness that a lot of viewers are going to like.
25;forwarded it with the subtitles on to see how it ended.
26;I watched it in the airport the other day and was impressed.
27;Great cast and very entertaining.
28;Good action and some hilarious parts.
29;Just watched it for the first time, and really enjoyed it very much.
30;Just watch and see for yourself and what I'm talking about
31;I love this movie so much!
32;It is really funny, well written, very quirky and has one of the coolest after effects intros ever.
33;all together a pretty fun and intelligent suspense comedy.
34;Instead of recounting the entire story (which you can read in the description), I'll actually review the film.
35;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang .
36;entirely unique, very clever, and extremely funny.
37;very well done!The film has a delightfully absurd flair to it.
38;I had no idea what to expect, but I loved it from the opening credit graphics all the way to the end.
39;Harry's (Downey) love interest .
40;is delightfully unselfconscious in her willowy hotness.
41;this pseudo film noir/absurd theater movie was completely entertaining and fun.
42;Refreshing, unusual movie, which show artistic LA like it is.
43;Downey is doing great in this one!
44;Plot is very twisted for peoplewho like something complicated and funny.
45;Nice plot, good acting and plenty of action.
46;Interesting plot and produced well.
47;Definitely would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a light hearted mystery.
48;both my wife and i enjoyed it very much.
49;If you enjoyed Robert Downy Jr early in his career as an actor then you will enjoy this movie.
50;It wasn't the most amazing movie in the world, but it is worth the watch.
51;This is an awesome crime noir comedy with some of the best one.
52;I love detective stories and the overall theme is a loving tribute to the more Pulpish, hard.
53;The dialogue is extremely well written, being punchy and nothing short of hilarious (in a good way).
54;Despite being kind of a loser, his almost childish enthusiasm manages to endear the audience to him completely.
55;If anything, I found the pace to meander between solid and choppy.
56;It sounded really interesting, but it was kind of a let down.
57;The movie was very entertaining to watch.
58;I would recommend it if you enjoyed movies like Get Shorty.
59;The characters in the movies were fun.
60;but cute, and certainly very entertaining.
61;Val Kilmer was great and certainly everyone loves Robert Downey jr.
62;If you love RDJr, you will love this.
63;Val Kilmer is also hilarious and the two play off each other very well.
64;i have seen this twice and laughed just as hard the second time.
65;She's in for a treat!
66;Not a very good movie at all.
67;The movie was fast paced and had witty humor.
68;Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer are great together.
69;Perfect amount of comedy and drama to keep you on the edge guessing bout what's gonna happen next.
70;Thanks to a recommendation from fellow Ammy.
71;friend, Jeffrey Miller, I decided to go ahead and check out `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.
72;Directed by a screenwriter, the film has a clever way of poking fun at the things we all tend to hate about movies.
73;clich s. the film starts at an industry party (well, it starts with a children's magician act) where we meet Harry who is there with Perry where he meets Harmony.
74;that said, there is also a LOT that I really liked about this movie.
75;the acting, for starters, was top notch.
76;Downey Jr. had a few spotty moments, but he handled the wit of the script very well, and sold quite a few scenes that could have tanked the film had they not been handled properly (his whole lost finger scenario was pricelessly handled, and that was a part of the film that could have easily been a flaw but he turned it into a highlight).
77;I have never truly been a devoted fan of his, but I have liked his work in the past (and feel that he should have an Oscar for his work in `The Doors'.
78;because I feel he was better than Hopkins in `The Silence of the Lambs'!)
79;and I consider this to be a shining star performance, one I never expected from him.
80;It is a modernized film noir that uses the director's knowledge of the writing process to create something that you've never seen before.
81;jeffrey, thanks for the recommendation!
82;This movie had me laughing the whole time!
83;I definitely recommend this movie if you need a good laugh!
84;Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer are fantastic!
85;The film contains a good mystery plot revolving around two mysterious murders in Los Angeles.
86;His emotional state allows him to give a heartfelt performance, and he is asked to come out to LA to get ready for the part.
87;"aware as a narrator, and he often criticizes his narration style, kicking himself for omitting critical details, and actually ""stopping"" the film to go back and show us the scene in question."
88;in addition to Harry's bizarre narration, a lot of the humor stems from Perry's constant insults towards Harry, which Kilmer always delivers in a delightful deadpan.
89;"Overall, this film is very enjoyable, and while it may put some people off (at the end, they actually apologize to ""all the nice people in the midwest"" for using the f. word so much), it is worth checking out, if only to hear Downey's hilarious narration techniques."
90;witted and riotously funny since he played in Chaplin.
91;He and Val Kilmer turn out to be a comedy team as good as those in Mel Brooks' early movies.
92;There are scenes that cause uproarious laughter in the theater.
93;The trio charm the audience and keeps the laughter at a high volume.
94;And finally, Downey's asides to the audience in his role as Narator are hilarious.
95;sharp dialogue and brilliant comedy.
96;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are great together.
97;I first saw this movie because of my love for Robert Downey Jr, and this is by far my favorite film by him.
98;The story is silly, clever, and dark.
99;There is a plethora of clever inside jokes and jibes.
100;"The cast is phenomenal
101;Michelle Monaghan also shines in this movie, she adds a lot of spark and goofiness to the film.
102;I was gasping, covering my mouth, laughing so hard at the clever jokes.
103;And, getting to watch Robert Downey Jr. look so great for 110 minutes was also a big plus.
104;if you want AMAZING acting, great laughs, and a good interactive story, then SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
105;One of the greatest and most underrated films of recent times, if not all time.
106;Shane Black's directorial debut is a hilariously thrilling, well.
107;made film from one of the master's greatest screenplays.
108;I love Robert Downey Jr. to me he could make any movie work in a good way.
109;i Theif story turns into a true love story!
110;You just gotta see it !!
111;Great dialogue, very well written and very funny.
112;Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are both great, and the story is really good as well.
113;A great story line that twists and turns in most unbelievable ways.
114;Fast paced and very funny.
115;I liked it a lot.
116;Lots of twists and turns coupled with plenty of entertaining narration from Robert Downey Jr. make this an enjoyable film for a light mood.
117;This is such a great movie with phenomenal actors and a brilliant script.
118;It is hilarious and terribly clever and surprisingly dark.
119;One of my absolute favorites.
120;It's definitely not the most hilarious, quotable, or epic movie in the world.
121;but a good watch which won't leave you feeling like something is missing
122;It has lots of comedy, mystery, action, romance and drama all in one solid package.
123;The acting was incredible on the parts of all of the leads.
124;You root for the good.
125;I've always loved Downey and I think he is one of the best actors of our time.
126;This movie gave me a new appreciation for Kilmer.
127;He was dry, yet so funny.
128;I was not familiar with Michelle Monaghan, but she felt very real to me.
129;This movie is great and somehow lost $ at the box office.
130;Please show it some well earned love and respect!
131;Witty story with unforeseeable twists and a very fun Robert Downey Jr. .
132;So not a party movie where everyone is paying only half attention but certainly great entertainment for 4 or less, guys and girls alike.
133;I liked this movie ** enjoyed just thought it was a movie for a lazy tv day!
134;It's an enjoyable, intelligent movie.
135;He's 11 years her senior.
136;That aside, the witty tweaks and nods with the genre's formula are more than enough to compensate for this misstep.
137;Robert had his character's clueless, wounded persona down, and served as a great foil for the unexpectedly funny Val Kilmer.
138;I was scrolling through the list of available prime movies looking for one with a fairly good rating when I ran across this movie.
139;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer starring together sounded pretty good to me.
140;And that's what Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is like: Relentlessly clever dialogue, witty screenplay, extremely self.
141;aware without crossing the line into being eye.
142;based noir film, the film moves so quickly and is so funny that many audiences may not catch that they're watching a film that could have once starred Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart.
143;toss in Robert Downey, Jr. doing his best work in years, Val Kilmer, funny again for the first time in decades and the new.
144;a. star Michelle Monaghan, and you've got a solid, solid cast capable of making the clever script pop.
145;and vastly superior to the sequels .
146;Definitely a movie you can watch over and over again and have it still be funny.
147;Robert Downey Jr did a really good job.
148;A number of funny parts.
149;For the most part the movie is good but not great.
150;I've enjoyed almost every movie Robert Downey Jr. s has been in but this one.
151;If you like RD Jr, you'll like it.
152;still, it's an enjoyable movie, if you don't take it tooseriously.
153;This was a witty, fast moving movie.
154;Many mature themes throughout but a good romp through LA.
155;Harry also meets up with his childhood sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY) and sparks begin to fly .
156;harry and Gay Perry are forcibly teamed up together due to their circumstances.
157;kISS KISS, BANG BANG is one of those films you have to watch to believe.
158;the comedy in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is dark, similar in tone to THE MATADOR (another flick I absolutely loved).
159;If you're """"in to"""" those kind of films, you should most definitely check out this one."""
160;I'll be watching it again!
161;I enjoyed it but, then I enjoyed the Jerk when it 1st came out.
162;Highly recommended to film buffs, mystery fans and anyone who like movies about Tinsel Town.
163;It's got teriffic perforomances, sharp, funny dialog, plenty of action and it's pretty sexy.
164;monaghan, Downey and Kilmer are a joy to watch.
165;The narrative style is perfect for the genre and the insults are fast and furious.
166;Downey, Jr is usually worth the cost of admission by himself, yet actors are slaves to their scripts.
167;This one was quirky, and the stabs at humor are largely welcome.
168;It's refreshing to actually be surprised at plot developments, and this occurs now and then here.
169;Val Kilmer is absolutely convincingly hilarious as the cold.
170;Overall, nice effort, not great, but fun.
171;I had to watch it twice before I really got it, but after that it was pretty good.
172;how much better could you do.
173;I find it entertaining and use it when I need a few chuckles.
174;Virtuoso performances in almost all the roles.
175;Superb dialogue, good sets, fast paced plot, likeable characters and subtle humor make this film five stars.
176;I really enjoyed this movie and it was well worth the watch!
177;This is a great movie.
178;It starts with a bang and keeps you laughing until the end.
179;You will want to see it againa and again.
180;First of all this is a great movie that many people overlooked, but should definately be seen.
181;humorous and entertaining picture that seems to be a hidden and fairly unknown picture with a great cast, well done
182;Shane Black shows his dark and elegant humor masterfully in an excellent outing by Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer.
183;In his triumphant return to the big screen performs masterfully as a second.
184;Kilmer proves he still has it as a gay detective with sharp wit and keen street sense.
185;see for viewers with a love of noir and clever writing.
186;The dialogue in this movie from Robert Downy and Val Kilmer is classic.
187;Robert Downey is great as the narrator/star and the movie is pretty funny.
188;I enjoyed it for its whimsy and plot twists.
189;An homage to the classic noir detective thrillers, this film boasts fine performances by all involved, especially Downey and Kilmer.
190;wrapped in sharp dialogue, understated wit, and a fast.
191;moving plot, delivered with beautiful cinematography.
192;but even he has some appeal in this movie.
193;This movie has some real laugh out loud moments and keeps you engaged throughout.
194;Just don't read to much about what other people think it is and watch it for yourself without expectations and you'll enjoy it.
195;Although this movie commits the usually worst sin in Hollywood filmmaking (voiceover narration) thanks to the abilities of Robert Downey and the writer to poke fun at that technique, it works.
196;"the whole update on the film noir genre also works thanks to its ability to integrate a wide world of El Lay landscape from Hollywood parties, MacArthur's Park, a mental hospital (reminiscent a bit of the old folks' home in ""Chinatown""), hotel rooftop pools and the ubiquitous roads and freeways of the county."
197;It is a funny movie.
198;Good actors in early years.
199;one of val kilmer's best roles.
200;Shane Black's directorial debut has a lot going for it: a good cast, fast paced action, witty dialogue.
201;the film throws every cliche at its viewer that it can muster and the overly contrived plot gets somewhat tiresome but there is great dialogue here written by the man who created Lethal Weapon.
202;The acting is good and the chemistry between Downey and Monaghan feels genuine.
203;This could have been a great film with a little work on the plot.
204;As it stands it's a merely good film.
205;That theme germinates throughout the entire piece, particularly led by the brand of snarky humor and brilliant one.
206;liners that Robert Downey Jr brought back into fashion with the Iron Man Franchise.
207;the Supporting performances are credible, even if Downey steals much of the spotlight, and some of the most memorable performance come from some the the tertiary actors, in their brief moments to shine.
208;kiss Kiss Bang Bang is definitely a gem in the rough.
209;but it makes sense in the end, and will leave most viewers wanting to watch a second time, once they catch up to speed.
210;ck it out and see if you can get into it.
211;This was a fun, amusing, and enjoyable video.
212;I recommend it and will add it to my :watch again list.
213;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the best murder mystery, lost love story ever!
214;Director Shane Black should be accredited for letting people remember what a brilliant comedian Robert Downey Jr. is and also revealing to the world that Val Kilmer (Gay Perry) can be equally hilarious.
215;The movie keeps you guessing the entire way through and never gives up too many clues so that you may be able to foreshadow the end of the film.
216;This I feel is a nice change because though Kevin Spacey and the entire cast of The Usual Suspects were perfect a lot of people new that he was Kaiser for at least half the movie, or at least they claim they did.
217;This is also such a break through perfomance for Michelle Monaghan, not only can she be sexy but she's witty and clever as well.
218;Way to break your way into Hollywood's eyes as a funny girl instead of a sex symbol!
219;Robert Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan are perfect together and though Michelle's character (Harmony) resists the temptation of sparking a perfectly new relationship with a high school best friend Harry (Downey Jr.) you never get frustrated with these two because their dialogue is so quick and funny you forget to care that they're not together.
220;Anyway this is a great film, hilarious narration by Mr. Downey Jr. and if you can count how many times Val Kilmer calls Downey Jr. an idiot and get sick of hearing it, I bow to you because I feel it just gets funnier and funnier every time.
221;This movie has such a Great cast but it is such a strange movie.
222;I enjoyed this unusual detective story.
223;The mystery will keep you guessing till the end.
224;"If you enjoyed this catch ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""."
225;An intresting mix of humor and action.
226;And an intresting story telling method.
227;Keeps you guessing and never knowing whayt is next.
228;A modern day film noire mixed in with comedy.
229;With very good acting and great writing, I highly recommended this film.
230;Robert Downey junior isn't normally my favorite actorbut in this movie he does a good job of adding humor.
231;The movie is many things, funny, serious, quirky, surprising and entertaining.
232;This was a great movie for Robert Downey Jr.
233;He was hilarious in it.
234;I highly recommend this movie for a fun movie night.
235;I really liked this movie.
236;The comic chemestry between the two male leads is excellent, the script is witty and intelligent and I found myself pleasantly amused and engaged throughout.
237;A film noir with a very ironic take on Hollywood with an angle interesting enough to make it into possible cult material.
238;Who knew that Val Kilmer could be so subtly funny and sarcastic.
239;I thought this was going to be a great movie.
240;I love Robert Downey Junior and Val Kilmer.
241;this is a very light weight movie.
242;the acting is great, that's what keeps the attention going, also a few really fun gags and funny lines.
243;but keep your intellect at home.
244;Robert Downy Jr. lots of interesting plot twists.
245;Kept me guessing who done it till the very end.
246;Great movie, great dialog, great acting, and well packaged product.
247;All in all, a very simple and easy way to get a good movie for a decent price.
248;The plot has many twists and turns and numerous incidents of a humorous nature.
249;It detracts from a truly unique visual experience.
250;This movie is really fast paced and funny.
251;It's the right mix of action, mystery and humor.
252;Better than average genre movie, sort of LA Confidential soft core noir, better than average script, good cast, watch it!
253;Really one of the most underrated films in my opinion.
254;I wouldn't normally dish out 5 stars unless something was a classic or an Oscar winner in my opinion.
255;Personalities that capture your interest.
256;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a stylish, fast paced, in your face, suspensful, violent, funny, modern, slice of film noir.You can tell that SOMEBODY took their time with this one.
257;Made sure they had a tight, solid and flawless script.
258;It's nice to be reminded who the real stars are.
259;michelle Monaghan is a charming and shining delight throughout the film.
260;vAL KILMER is always an underrated talent and one of my favorites.
261;He's been robbed of an Oscar twice (Tombstone and the Doors), and he's been shunned in some circles, but Val has always been unique and takes chances.
262;He proves in this movie how good HE IS and ALWAYS has been.
263;kISS KISS, BANG BANG is a fast moving creative minded joy and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies like I do.
264;So, seeing as though, this has very very few special features.
265;I saw this movie on cable, and liked it so much, I bought it(my criteria is that I have to want to watch it more than once) Excellent cast in this twisted tale of murder, with lots of sly humor.
266;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are hilarious.
267;For some reason this is one of my favorite movies.
268;A slightly predictable mystery with unique narration.
269;It's clever, the cast is amazing, and the jokes are almost too perfect.
270;Some of Robery Downey Jr.'s finest work.
271;We like romantic love comedies more than we liked this kind of movie It was a well done movie but not our kind
272;I will spare you any plot summary as it really wouldn't be that useful and the film is full of fun surprises anyway.
273;The fact is that this is an extremely well written and acted movie that will be sure to delight viewers across a wide range.
274;the pacing is impeccable and every scene has it's own little gem that makes it memorable.
275;out performances, perhaps especially Kilmer's incredibly natural portrayal of [.]
276;The commentary is rather expansive and funny.
277;you wonder if the actors and director and enjoying weed and martinis as they converse.
278;Director Shane Black has an interesting backstory, check it out in the editorial review above.
279;but hopefully it will build up the cult following it so richly deserves.
280;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, references both Pauline Kael and James Bond and is a joy to view.
281;Monster good work by Downey.
282;kiss Kiss, Bang Bang presents superior film production values.
283;This film can be viewed with Robert Downey, Jr. in US Marshals and Mr. Downey's two Sherlock Holmes films for a very decent assortment.
284;At one time, and maybe he still is, Shane was Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter, proud author of such big.
285;In other words, he knew how to hit a bulls.
286;eye with the 18 to 28 male target audience.
287;The witty parody wins, but it's a close call.
288;Because Black can't resist self.
289;It's the brittle style, smart.
290;mouth dialogue, loving reverence for the noir sensibility and the acting that gives us pleasure.
291;The movie chapter headings he gives us, each one a title of a Raymond Chandler novel, is a case in point.
292;kilmer and Monaghan do fine jobs with their roles, but it is Downey who really shines.
293;He now has a hard.
294;in face that serves him well.
295;He can handle drama as easily as comedy.
296;Downey gives Harry a great deal for us to like.
297;Harry survives because he's serious, because he's loyal to Perry, because he loves Harmony and because Downey has superb comic timing.
298;"The appeal is what attracts us and ultimately makes us despair when we begin to understand how seldom movies are more than this.'"""
299;This movie is original and funny, with descent suspense and twists.
300;Of course, the stories continue to get more conveluded and intertwined as the body count goes up, to an ending that is a nice surprise.
301;Funny, entertaining, suspenseful, a movie that could have been promoted more by the company.
302;Very funny, very awkward, and totally perfect.
303;RDJ is always good but this was one of my all time favorites.
304;well, sort of, but for more on that you'll have to watch the film.
305;Writer and first time director Shane Black manages wonderfully to take the essence of those pulpy fiction detective novels (which literally figure into the actual story) and fuse it with some modernly icky sensibilities in a kooky amalgam that never takes itself too seriously, the result being some kind of weird fusion that works and works well, for myself at least.
306;Black does an outstanding job directing, especially given the amount of things thrown at the viewer in terms of twists and turns.
307;It's not like he had extensive experience with firearms) and a few, menial continuity errors, but given the fact the feature kept me thoroughly engaged and entertained throughout, it was easy for me to overlook this aspects.
308;I thought Downey, who supposedly cleaned up his personal issues, did a remarkable job in the main role, and I especially liked his narration, which, at times, became self aware as his character would make critical comments on the film itself.
309;I also thought Kilmer did an excellent job as the gay, streetwise detective, and the pairing of him and Downey provided a weird and interesting chemistry that worked surprisingly well.
310;the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, is sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 audio, available in English, French, and Spanish, comes across strong and crisp.
311;I viewed this film for a film class focusing on the history of gangster and detective movies.
312;All performances were top notch, but that of Robert Downey Jr. was superb.
313;There is no better actor performing today in my view.
314;Its well written, everybody in it is perfectly cast and its surprisingly easy to follow for an intentionally non.
315;It also manages to be funny and exciting while being totally absurd.
316;"After seeing so many movies with ""messages"" about good, evil, life, death and infinity (usually based on comic books) its refreshing to something that's all in fun."
317;This is one movie where both the actors and the audience get to have a really good time.
318;I love great dialogue play.
319;Two great comedy actors who have the depth to get down and dirty in the drama.
320;Just the right about of action and humor.
321;It was also good to see Val Kilmer before he got fat!
322;I don't know how I missed seeing this movie when it came out years ago, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it moved a bit fast for my husband who had a hard time hearing the quick quips between RDJ and Kilmer.
323;funny funny it was awesome liked it alot funny funny lmao funny funny good excellent love the main character great
324;This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and it comes highly recommended to watch it with your finger on PAUSE, as I couldn't go three minutes without laughing so loud I drowned the movie out.
325;Amazing casting and an interesting juxtaposition of the bi guy in the straight role with the straight guy in the gay role.
326;speaker you'll love it more, being as characters often speak over one another .
327;based humor and not merely situational humor, it's every bit as funny as Office Space and The Big Lebowski, two gems for character.
328;It'll make your cheeks sore laughing.
329;This was my husbands Valentine gift and It gaves us a great time TOGETHER!!!!
330;An example of a wonderful tradition in cerebral storytelling that the market places greater demand on than the studios are willing to finance.
331;This is one of my favorite examples of the genre.
332;Choice of wording, awesome, .
333;I've really liked this move for a long time.
334;I found it in BR, so inexpensive.
335;I'd highly recommend, but be sure you like the actors in it.
336;It was an interesting take on living L. a. and the duo of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmner was inventive.
337;Anyway, it was worth watching and I enjoyed the witty bantor between the two actors.
338;I expected more from these two great actors.
339;i was very pleasantly surprised.
340;the dialog is sharp and witty and the story is fun.
341;and it is such a breath of fresh air too.
342;There are plenty of comical situations, but actual moments of comedy are few and far between.
343;such as corpses turning up at the rate of one per hour.
344;with the expert, the idiot newbie, and ideal dream girl.
345;very funny, if you look away for a moment you may miss something
346;this is one of my favorite movies and i'm glad it's out on blu.
347;it has a great plot line (although a little complicated), really witty dialogue, and a great cast.
348;if you are a robert downey jr. or val kilmer fan, i highly recommend it.
349;I had seen the movie years ago, but after Iron Man 3 I realized I wanted to see it again to see if I could sense the director's touch in both films.
350;Everyone in this movie delivers a great performance, and it's got a great combination of funny and serious.
351;I would love to see another.
352;This is a watch over movie.
353;There is much to enjoy here, including some laugh.
354;loud moments and some enthusiastic skewering of action movie cliches.
355;I don't want to give y'all any spoilers, but it is a great deconstruction of the detective genre.
356;paced, well acted and often very funny.
357;This film, his directorial debut and both a satire and successor to LETHAL WEAPON, is so unpredictable, spontaneous, and cynical as to leave you, the viewer, wondering WTF you've been hit with, a baseball bat or whoopie cushion.
358;You're in for a wild ride .
359;Downey Jr. and Kilmer carry this film with non.
360;(Watch the blooper reel to see them both break up, and also maintain the creative fire during filming.)
361;For now, it's just an overlooked masterwork that is a true bargain on BD.
362;Clever story, just not my style.
363;It took a while to develop the story, so stay with it.
364;"Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as the main character *and* as the narrator (who constantly breaks the ""fourth wall"" and talks to you as if you are watching a movie!"
365;Val Kilmer also delivers a grand performance, as expected, and the scenes with the two of them together (most of the movie) are hilarious!!
366;essentially, this movie is part film noir detective, part eighties buddy action flick, part comedy.
367;And it works like a charm!
368;They continue to make you laugh even more in that!!
369;Don't remember much of the hype on this movie, but ended up being quite a solid story plot and was very entertaining
370;Watched about 20 minutes and found a better use of my time.
371;up job as Gay Perry .
372;The narration done by Downey is refreshing.
373;The spider scene is great too!
374;What happens when you put Kilmer and Downey together in a movie, you get a great fantastic hilarous, serious movie!
375;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a quite funny black comedy.
376;Those who enjoy the work of BOTH Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer will find this a perfect mix!The pace and writing are both top notch!
377;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of the best movies I have seen all year.
378;It is clever, it is funny, and it is unique.
379;Movies like this one are usually fun, but not this fun.
380;It mantains it's pace, humor, and plot twisting throughout the entire movie.
381;It is also possibly Val Kilmer's best role since Doc Holiday.
382;Just watch it, that is all I can say.
383;KKBB is one wild trip of a movie.
384;Dark, comic and genre satirizing, it takes you over and over again on one crazy trip after another.
385;Downey is excellent here and his narration is an example of perfect deadpan humor.
386;I have never been a big fan of Kilmer, but here he is quite funny and a lot less hammy than he has been in the past.
387;They, along woth Monaghan make a great comic, if bloody, trio.
388;The film is also gorgeously photographed and beautiful look at.
389;robert Downey Jr is so funny as the actor who pretends to be detective.
390;And Val Kilmer is perfect as Gay Perry.
391;I think its the best role he has ever done.
392;these two actors made the perfect team !
393;The Screenplay and writing are fast paced, and comical.
394;very rarely do I enjoy dark humor.
395;And very rarely do I see a movie twice.
396;But I enjoyed this film so much, I am thinking of going back and seeing it again.
397;Good Movie for a cold night!Robert Downey is a good at anything he does.
398;entertaining in a strange way!
399;I Have always liked Robert Downey Jr. movies, and while it seemed funny I admit that I didn't make it through the whole movie but some day I might.
400;The repartee between Robert Downey, Jr. and Michelle Monaghan is sexy and cute, and a beefy, but in.
401;An LA landscape of pretty starlets with no Hollywood future is the backdrop and it's great to see Corbin Berensen getting work.
402;"As always, Robert Downey Jr. gives a performance that makes one believe one is born with the acting gene
403;What a truly enjoyable film!
404;The ending is a bit of a puzzlement, but then, appropriate to the rest of the film.
405;Downey shows his maturing talent.
406;This was the funniest and most intriguing murder non.
407;I don't know what movie they saw, but the one I saw starred Robert Downey, Jr, and Val Kilmar.
408;It was full of funny and scarry ups and downs.
409;It really was very interesting.
410;i loved how the director mixed humor with scariness.
411;great flick!Two thumbs up!MC White said: Check it out!!!
412;my wife was right this time.
413;Fun, fun, fun in a demented sort of way!
414;Loved it and had some serious belly laughs!
415;But that was the charm of the movie, a bunch of misfits doing extraordinary things without really thinking about it.
416;Val and Robert are great together and Michelle Monaghan is great to look at and her character takes some figuring out.
417;cause i thought this movie was pretty good.
418;This is one of those movies .
419;Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer, both good on their own, have a fabulous chemistry that makes you want to see them work together again.
420;Great actors in the movie and can't wait to enjoy this movie over and over again.
421;a good way to kill and hour and a half
422;Robert Downy Jr. and Val Kilmer are a hilarious duo.
423;This is a very funny movie.
424;light hearted and absolutely goofy.
425;It is light and entertaining.
426;I recommend it if you just want to laugh at something.
427;RDJ and Val Kilmer are awesome together in this movie that proves that noir and extreme happenstance can be a lot of fun.
428;There's plenty of everything in this movie!
429;I love his demeanor, he looks like he is permanently spaced out, perfect.
430;This doesn't really work, but is a good idea, and could have been pulled off by a good indie director.
431;I saw the trailer for it back when it was playing in theaters, and really wanted to see it.
432;I found myself just loving the film in the first twenty minutes.
433;Val and Robert are hilarious together.
434;Their chemistry is the driving force of the movie.
435;Michelle Monaghan is a huge talent in my opinion.
436;All three actors had amazing chemistry and that is what made this movie totally awesome.
437;I cannot fathom words to describe how brilliant this movie is.
438;Val Kilmer and RDJ have perfect on screen chemistry which makes their wonderfully witty banter even more amazing.
439;Likable characters, fun plot, non.
440;Highly recommended by two hard.
441;It was an interesting story and Val Kilmer and Robert Downey did a good job with it.
442;This may be our favorite role for Val Kilmer in that we weren't big fans.
443;In this role he stepped up and delivered.
444;Robert Downey was in character and gave us some good acting.
445;Compelling and somewhat casual flim making technique.
446;I laughed the entire time, and the film is just really well made.
447;This has to be Robert Downey Jr's best acting to date.
448;He looks to be in the best shape of his life.
449;You can tell the actors in this film really had a good time"
450;This is one of the best movies of 2006 in my opinion.
451;I enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end.
452;This is the kind of film making I'd like to see more of.
453;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang combines numerous movie genres so well it ends up being new and refreshing.
454;"It's a perfect example of what can be done with a little imagination
455;5 stars for excellent performances and a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
456;Robert Downey Jr is an acting genius.
457;One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
458;Even with it being a few years old it was still great.
459;I felt it was very funny, I like anything with Mr. Downey.
460;I enjoyed this film because it is not too formulaic, quite funny at times and has a poignant story line.
461;Robert Downey is pretty convincing as a ne'er do well transplant from New York but the real treat is Val Kilmer who plays a gay private eye/movie consultant deftly and never goes over the top with his performance.
462;He and Robert Downey Jr. have good on.
463;screen chemistry and this coupled with some sardonic dialogue makes for a few good laughs.
464;Michelle Monaghan plays well as a striking Midwest girl in search of the Hollywood lights who is also Downey Jr.'s first love and therein lies a sweet and romantic story element.
465;I will not say too much for fear of spoiling the story but I do recommend this film because it is fresh, has a lot of heart and strength in its nuances.
466;One of my favorite movies.
467;Good plot and of course .
468;wonderful acting by Downey and Kilmer
469;Too many voice overs but otherwise this is a wise cracking, fun crime drama with the usual charismatic performance by Robert Downey Jr.
470;We decided to give and a try and were happy we did.
471;An entertaining play on the hard boiled detective thriller which pays homage to Hollywood's movies of yore, while at the same time making fun of modern Hollywood's clich s.
472;It's worth watching for free, if you have Amazon Prime.
473;It is a good flick that keeps you entertained"
474;This is a movie that has its moments.
475;The synopsis is quite accurate but the manner it happens is one of the things that make it worth watching.
476;downey, Kilmer, and Monaghan give it their best and it is good to see Downey back on the screen: he is a gifted actor after all.
477;The saving grace of the film is thanks to cinematographer Michael Barrett who shows us a Los Angeles of spectacular beauty.
478;Not the best movie I've seen but if you just need a couple of laughs this movie is a good one to watch.
479;Everything about this movie is awesome in my opinion.
480;A really fun ride and some nice twists and turns.
481;WE thought the acting was good and it was funny.
482;downey and Kilmer were good together.
483;My wife and I thought the movie was a bit hard to follow sometimes but enjoyable to watch nonetheless.
484;It's very violent, it's funny, and it has an interesting story.
485;Another fine performance by Ribert Doeney Jr.
486;It's a comedy/drama/satire movie that's also sweet at the right times.
487;Well casted, well acted, well filmed, and almost well written .
488;Nicely set up and compelling in the beginning .
489;Downey and Kilmer make an unlikely but highly watchable duo.
490;Downey is spot on as ever, but it's Kilmer who shines.
491;Worth watching mainly if you're either a Downey or Kilmer fan .
492;shane Black (famed for his screenplays on the Lethal Weapon series) makes his directing debut and comes up with an unmitigated winner.
493;In this lively, darkly funny feature, Black successfully integrates slick production values with a witty, tangled, self.
494;"the actors are very good here
495;The three leads have combustible chemistry.
496;Val Kilmer endows Gay Perry with a perfect balance of machismo, intelligence and world.
497;Harmony is decidedly smart, is delightfully down to earth, and has had life experience.
498;Hopefully, we see more of the sexy Michele in future films.
499;But it is Robert Downey, Jr. who shines the most.
500;His charisma is still intact, his wry, droll acting skills still very much present for us to savor.
501;He's still very, very likable.
502;I think Downey, Jr. is an actor I'll always root for.
503;But what it does have is pretty sweet: A funny film commentary by Shane Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer"
504;Day and night scenes show strength of contrast.
505;Colors are very bright, vivid, richly saturated and the image offers attractive flesh tones.
506;The audio mix is pretty tight, with a surprising amount of surround effects for such a dialogue.
507;The casting is fantastic, Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious as Harry.
508;It moves like a film noir, it's fast.
509;paced, witty, and brimming with humor.
510;Everyone will absolutely adore this movie.
511;The movie is funny and exciting.
512;His movies have goofy action that is very recognizable.
513;Rdj is my favorite actor, so I may be a little bias, but you don't want to miss this hilarious movie.
514;There was an attempt to make this film witty, silly and fun.
515;A few scenes with some beautiful naked women was one of the films redeeming qualities.
516;This is more than a movie, it's an experience.
517;I've never seen a more quotable or consistently funny film.
518;This is beyond cult classic.
519;Robert Downey Jr. is fun to watch and the girl is really pretty but that's about all you'd be watching this for.
520;Wasn't sure what I was anticipating when I watched this, but it was great!
521;The way they started the story, how they cut it and the insanely funny lines and moments in the movie.
522;it is very rare these days that a movie twists around so many times that my head figuratively twists off.
523;the performances were great for the roles they were supposed to play.
524;if you are at all curious though, it is worth checking out.
525;Robert Downey and Val Kilmer have excellent chemistry together in this film.
526;Its a noir mystery with a few twists.
527;Really all you need to do is sit back and enjoy.
528;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang bears more than one watching for its tangled plot (although nicely explicated in the end), its numerous throwaway funny lines, and its sheer entertainment.
529;Downey and Kilmer have great fun with their roles and the supporting cast is fine as well.
530;Round it all out with snacks and a nice bottle of wine and you've got a great night of at.
531;one of my all time favorite moves.
532;it is an interesting mystery with a bit of comedy and sharp dialogue.
533;It was entertaining and funny but by no means a phenomenal movie.
534;I definitely loved seeing Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr.
535;I have always liked Val and he and Robert Downey Jr were good.
536;Good movie, lots of action, and twists.
537;Would recommend movie to family and friends
538;A funny and entertaining movie.
539;Had not seen it before so thought it was well worth watching.
540;A must watch movie for fans of Val Kilmer and Robert Downy Jr.
541;perfection by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.
542;downey Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a professional burgler and narrator of 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.
543;"While the story has all the characters and fixings of a detective story (a rich, shady producer
544;'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' also wants you to know it's clever by having Harry break the fourth.
545;so why do I enjoy this film?
546;When this movies' funny it's FUNNY!
547;place seriousness I knew it had some perfectly timed comedy right around the corner.
548;as I've said 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' would be nothing without it's main characters and Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer deliver some of the best performances of their careers.
549;assured in his sometimes ignorance.
550;nails portrayal of Gay Perry is refreshing and his back and forth dialogue with Downey (""""where the hell did you learn math?"""")"""
551;Michelle Monaghan is likeable as Harry's high.
552;'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' is my ultimate guilty pleasure.
553;I can't recommend it for everyone as it's annoyances are many and it's self.
554;But I cant deny I enjoyed watching this movie and it still manages to make me laugh after all this time.
555;Anyone can do that, there is no creative wit!
556;go ahead and watch it.
557;I can only hope you enjoy this movie more than I did.
558;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang provided a better than expected, albeit a bit Campy nod to Film Noir and Sam Spadish detective mystery with plenty of modern day twists, action, and a good dose of humor to entertain.
559;The story is full of twists and turns, but the real treat in this movie is the fast dialog and dry delivery of Downey and Kilmer.
560;Very slickly produced big budget crime movie that oozeswith a knowingly quirky style.
561;some cool acting from Downey, Kilmer.
562;Quite funny in parts with witty one.
563;Three friends get together one last time to have fun after one of them is released from a long prison sentence.
564;This movie is a sleeper in that I have never heard of it.
565;This movie is smart, wickeldy clever, completely jawdropping and downright hilarious as Shane Black mixes comedy and action smoother than silk and butter in this one.
566;Strong cast, good story line, good acting.
567;I nice mix of comedy and murder mystery.
568;I had never heard of it before, so I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.
569;Best to watch when folding laundry or ironing sheets and towels.
570;Never heard of this movie but it had a couple of good actors and was entertaining and had lots of action.
571;This is one of my favorite Robert Downey, Jr. movies.
572;Robert Downy Jr is excellent as always.
573;he can be a good actor.
574;It's ridiculously dirty and hilarious in a rather unique sort of way.
575;This could have been a very funny movie, but the screenplay got in the way.
576;I kept waiting for a bit of clarity.
577;I love movies so I hung in waiting.
578;There was a moment here and there that showed promise, but not worth the wait.
579;The movie is good, fun, and you can enjoy a good time watching this movie.
580;Although it is narrated by the protagonist is really good
581;This is definitely a participatory movie, one that demands your full, undivided attention.
582;Luckily, it's worth the effort and is quite entertaining.
583;This movie is a must.
584;If you are a Michelle Monaghan fan, some of her best and most.
585;really cute, young, and nude actually .
586;but in as tasteful a way as possible (it has to do with the story).
587;yeah he is still here, and critics aside, obviously can still act but is rich enough he doesn't really care what they think .
588;I'm so glad audiences who are Iron Man fans are rediscovering it and now you can actually find it on Amazon and stream it on Netflix, and that those old negative reviews have suddenly been up.
589;revised to reflect the more contemporary view .
590;this is not only a film worth seeing, but an entertaining piece with great ensemble work from all involved, and highly influential for the way it was made and it's impact on cinema in the ensuing decade.
591;Val Kilmer is great and Morton Downy Jr. is awesome as always.
592;Interesting concept except for the need to prove they can say every dirty word in the book.
593;I found this movie to be quite funny and entertaining.
594;I recommend this to anyone who just wants to laugh and be entertained
595;nice performances, but you cannot follow this if you had a guidebook.
596;I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, so I came to it with an open mind.
597;"What I came away with was that this is an ""Art Film"" wannnabe."
598;It is good to see Robert Downey Jr. return to film and good to see Val Kilmer as well, but the film plods along baiting us into thinking that at any moment it is going to break into something other than an average film.
599;I had to go and see it because Shane Black's previous screenplays (Lethal Weapon, the Last Boyscout, The Long kiss Goodnight) were hardboiled action flicks with a great feel of cool attitude, but they all featured characters that were really touching for the genre.
600;tHIS MOVIE HAS SPIRITAnyway, Black has written his best screenplay ever, with highly colorful characters, offering Downey and Kilmer, 2 beautiful has.
601;been in Hollywood terms, their best roles in 10 years.
602;black likes film noir and he knows how the genre works.
603;He even reveals some of his trick.
604;trades through some dialogues, not only about KKBB but he also makes connection to his previous scripts (L. a., buddy movies, Xmas time, scenes of torture followed by a big gunfight,.)
605;You take a genre film, quote the rules, wink at the audience, then break the rules.
606;There are beautiful moments between Downey and Michelle Monaghan, and especially one piece of dialogue you would not expect after the spider.
607;tHIS MOVIE HAS GUTSIt really does!
608;The dialogues are sharp and straight to the stomach style.
609;expect a few loud laughs as well.
610;Some scenes got me laughing very lound in the theater whereas I first saw it by myself.
611;I suspect a huge fan.
612;base will build around this unsung masterpiece.
613;this came as the greatest surprise of last year and I just could watch it over and over again.
614;Watched this over the holidays and loved this movie.
615;Robert Downey jr. is excellent and funny but Val Kilmer stole the show in this movie.
616;It's got comedy, but it's also got drama.
617;It's got mystery, but it's also got action.
618;"written by Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"" films and a little gem called, ""The Monster Squad""), ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" is clever, action."
619;packed, filled with great characters, and riddled with hilarious, witty dialogue.
620;If you're a true fan of movies, this a film you must see.
621;It's ideas about Hollywood, actors, and happy endings are unique and refreshing.
622;Whenever he shows up, you're even more glued to the screen than you were before.
623;Michelle Monaghan could have easily played the damsel in distress card and phoned it in, but she really makes the most of her character.
624;Both her and Downey Jr. are great together.
625;the look and feel of the film were exceptional as well.
626;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are outstanding and the story is intricate and fun.
627;Fun from start to finish.
628;The back and forth between RDJ and Val is classic, and you can tell they were having a blast making this.
629;This is a beautifully made film with fine performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.
630;Like any good film noir, it is full of surprises as the dead bodies accumulate.
631;Robert Downey Jr. is at his comical best here!
632;Love the dog and the finger part.
633;I thoroughly love this movie.
634;RDJ and Val Kilmer have a great back and forth chemistry.
635;The entire movie is an ode to film noir (think LA Confidential) but with its own attitude that both admires and makes fun of the genre.
636;Not Oscar material, but definitely worth a watch.
637;This is a wonderful and much underrated film: and in Blu.
638;ray format the color is dazzling.
639;Great core group of characters.
640;One of those great missed movies.
641;The commentary, where the director and actors talk over the movie, in the extras, is better than the movie, and had me laughing out loud.
642;Val Kilmer is a riot !
643;But I loved the acting and crazy story:)
644;it was very good I did not see the ending coming I really enjoyed itRobert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer play very well opposite each other
645;A funny and entertaining movie.
646;Worth watching for a night in.
647;bONUS: Michelle Monaghen has a top frontal nudity scene.
648;This is mildly entertaining, at its best.
649;You can almost here the writer screaming: Look how deep this really is!
650;In my opinion this was both Robert Downey Jr's comeback movie (and still my favorite of his) as well as the last great thing to ever feature Val Kilmer.
651;I will tell you though that it is okay, not amazing, but sufficient to move things along.
652;Very dry, very droll, very funny, great voice.
653;over by Downey, good writing.
654;"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of those humorous takes on the ""film noir"" genre that wants to have it both ways: it makes clever comments and funny asides about the conventions of the genre (mostly via voiceover narration) while, at the same time, wanting to tell a genuinely involving ""noir"" story, too."
655;And I have to say that, for the most part, the film succeeds.
656;Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer in particular seem to be having a lot of fun.
657;One of my all time favorites Robert Downey narrates this movie great and Val Kilmer was extremely funny classic movie I can keep watching over and over
658;It was good and funny at times Robert Downey was actually entertaining I really did see the ending coming.
659;Funny and makes you think is a pretty good combination.
660;Against that backdrop this film makes for a true diamond in the rough treasure.
661;A cast of characters quirky enough to fit in, or even make a scene, is dropped into the pot along with a few dead bodies, a mental institution, a big bad rich.
662;Now take that lovely hornets nest and Shake Well.
663;A marvelous wash of insane happenstances, surprising behaviors, never.
664;Robert Downey Junior has done better movies in the past few years, surprised to see he signed on for this.
665;Item received was just in 'OK' condition.
666;The disc was scratched and not in 'Very Good' shape.
667;There are so many other movies in this genre that are good.
668;"Part ""Pulp Fiction"", part ""Get Shorty"", part ""Fight Club."
669;Despite the fact that all the cool kids quit watching these kind of movies years ago, I still think they're great popcorn flicks.
670;Simple enough that I can turn off most of my brain, and yet with enough twists, sharp editing, and funny voice over narration to cater to my ruined attention span.
671;"But that's part of the fun of this movie as well
672;and some parts of the movie were actually kind of funny.
673;Good story line and excellent acting from Robert Downey, Jr.
674;My husband also liked it.
675;a bit gruesome in parts, but overall a good movie, Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer worked!
676;the movie gets better as it goes and finishes well.
677;Kilmer hits a great grove in this flick.
678;Robert Downey Jr is great in this movie.
679;excellent movie"
680;you know what is happening yet you continue to watch it.
681;definitely one for a date night or to watch with friends, is definitely not family friendly.
682;This is one of my favourite films.
683;It's easy to think of him in Iron Man terms, where he can throw a punch and be the hero in or out of the suit.
684;This plays back and forth a bit, and it's interesting to see what the character does in the moments where the choice becomes paramount.
685;val Kilmer is surprisingly good in this film.
686;He brings it to the mat.
687;overall, this film is fun.
688;Definitely good for a night in :)
689;for the script, if you could let go of yourself of all the logic and decide to have a good time before stepping into the dark theatre, then this movie is quite all right and sometimes funny.
690;the most bothering scenario and the scenes that bothered me so much was the left pinky finger, broken so easily by a shutting door, broken so evenly, at that moment it's still fine with me.
691;i'd like you to watch carefully how and why robert downey jr was a good actor but never a great one.
692;great actors always covered all the basis he played with consistency and logic.
693;like this broken finger, a good actor and a good director could both do a lot good on this scenario, but in this movie, they both lost it.
694;the matured val kilmer actually acted better and better and he never exaggerated the acting and overdid anything, his performance was very solid in this melodrama.
695;Great movie and great cast!
696;It also features a great script.
697;The acting was good and the settings were beautiful.
698;Robert Downey Jr. is a good actor to watch.
699;so I was super excited to see them both in one film.
700;First thing to note is that this movie is right on the cusp of when Val Kilmer loses touch with reality and Robert Downey Jr was just about to be reborn as Iron Man.
701;But it is one of those experieces that you need .
702;so if you like the bizzar, this is for you.
703;because Val and Robert are ultimately talented and it wasn't their fault that the movie had issues.
704;I enjoy using Prime and will continue to watch.
705;Overall the movie was entertaining.
706;The actors\actresses did a good job with their characters.
707;I really enjoyed this show!
708;I loved the narration aspect, too.
709;Made for some good laughs along the way.
710;law told me what a good movie this was so I bought it.
711;actually, it was very juvenile, but I still enjoyed Val.
712;Now that I've seen it in context it's funny, classic Robert Downey, Jr.
713;Good actors Somewhat funny plot.
714;I really like both Actors in this movie, that's why I bought it.
715;I really enjoyed this movie!
716;Robert Downey, Jr. is one of my favorite actors, and he certainly shows why in this film.
717;He is intelligent and sarcastic, but also has a big heart.
718;The first time I watched this film, I thought it was great, but a lot of the plot didn't make sense since it was kind of all over the place.
719;"The second time, I found myself repeatedly saying, ""Oh, okay!"""
720;Downey's character keeps blowing it, so your heart goes out to him while you're laughing at his foibles.
721;If you like dark comedy with a very wicked sense of humor, give this one a shot!
722;This one is by far one of my top movies.
723;this movie kept me laughing and I loved Downey's humorous narration through the movie.
724;Some people would say that this movie has some unbelievable parts, but those parts just fit the movie so well.
725;If you can look past the F word being said after every other word than you'll enjoy it thoroughly!
726;the combination of these three fascinating characters creates a dynamic, exhilarating and exciting presence that is sure to have your complete attention on the screen at all times trying to make sure not to miss a thing.
727;With the witty brilliant dialogue, unexpected surprises, and hot action it's sure to leave you pleased.
728;downey delivers in this film with excellency, proving to me that he is an under.
729;The only thing I have against his character is how surprisingly amazing of a gunslinger he becomes at the end of the movie.
730;"but than again he is an ""amazing magician""."
731;or in his case would you call it gay forward?This movie receives 5/5 stars from me for it's creativity, originality and sense of humor.
732;Here's a line from the movie that I enjoyed.
733;The definition for idiot because that's what you are!
734;"Like hanging out with a generous drug dealer, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" sounds like it might be fun at first but midstride turns uncomfortable, disappointing and a bit embarrassing for all participating parties."
735;Michelle Monaghan is a vision to behold, but, in an award.
736;I will agree with another reviewer who said the cinematography was good.
737;A murder mystery with witty dialogue.
738;Very entertaining, though of course there is quite a bit of violence, and it's even a little cheesy at times.
739;Worth watching at least once.
740;I thought this was an extremely funny and entertaining movie.
741;I read the reviews and agreed with most.
742;Its more of a sophisticated and dry humor type.
743;Robert Downey Jr. is at his best, and Val Kilmer portrayed one of the more memorable characters I can remember seeing.
744;The rest of the movie is very self.
745;aware and entertaining, and a good play off the older detective noir of decades past.
746;"The two of them share an appreciation for the pulp novels of the 1950s and 1960s featuring a Mike Hammer type PI called ""Jonny Gossamer."
747;KISS KISS BANG BANG is a lot of fun.
748;the movie is stunning to look at besides.
749;"The credits are impeccable
750;as Harmony Miss Monaghan, a Denise Richards lookalike, shows a talent that can stand right up next to the fast talking dames of the thirties like Rosalind Russell or Carole Lombard, and plus she has a genuine American beauty tht makes it believable she could come from somewhere central, like Indiana.
751;I hope it does well enough to merit numerous sequels, as THE THIN MAN did.
752;it certainly is not the best work by Downey, but his name and performance brings a lot to the depth of the story.
753;I saw this was recently added to the Prime account and really didnt have very high hopes for it at all but wow we were shocked and loved this movie.
754;It has the quick humor and funny antics that made this murder who done it a great watch.
755;Downey Jr., Monaghan and Kilmer have great chemistry in this witty action.
756;The writing, directing and cast are all perfect.
757;I would recommend to anyone.
758;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a fascinating example of a film almost too """"cool"""" for it's own good."""
759;satisfied, so pleased with it's own cleverness.
760;"But the odd thing is, ""Kiss Kiss"" walks that fine line so precariously.yet falls onto the side of good entertainment."
761;It's fast paced, funny and filled with good performances.
762;The film works as a homage to every pulp fiction detective story you've ever read and/or seen.
763;Following all the necessary conventions, yet tweaking them with abundant humor, it's a twisty and fun ride.
764;"up of pulp detective and noir films, ""Kiss Kiss"" actually works as an effective satire on Hollywood as well."
765;"on in it's depiction of the Hollywood ""scene"" and the community on the cusp of success."
766;"But the success of ""Kiss Kiss"" relies most heavily on it's screenplay."
767;One of the funniest, self.
768;aware (but in a good way), and fastest scripts I've seen in a long time.
769;most of the lines are delivered so quickly and in such a dead pan manner, it takes a moment to process just how witty they are.
770;This is an intelligent comedy for someone that appreciates cleverness, and you miss a lot of humor if you're not paying close attention.
771;"this time mainstream humor with ""inside"" industry jokes."
772;so that everyone can enjoy this sly film.
773;This is the type of material he excels at.
774;Val Kilmer has received a lot of attention as a gay private eye and it's a nicely controlled performance.
775;It's good to see him return to sophisticated entertainment.
776;And Michelle Monaghan also does nicely in the sexy, smart girlfriend role.
777;recommended to mystery and comedy lovers, and particularly suited to film geeks and noir enthusiasts.
778;Kiss Kiss works on that rare level of absurd, but intelligent, entertainment.
779;this film was very funny and wasn't afraid to make fun of itself by using stereotypical Hollywood cliches.
780;overall this movie was funny and full of self.
781;The murder mystery takes a backseat to the comedy in this worthwhile film and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
782;Although some points in the story were a little thin, the great work from both Downey and Kilmer, and their chemistry, along with the gorgeous damsel in distress, Michelle Monoghan, managed to hold this movie together.
783;Love this movie, it has very funny and intelligent script.
784;Like always Robert Downey,Jr was perfect, Val Kilmer did a great job too.
785;We enjoyed it a lot.
786;Very funny with many twists and turns.
787;Downey is in fine form as is the whole cast.
788;Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer are a perfect comedic comedy team in this movie.
789;This movie has Mystery, Comedy, action and more!!!
790;Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are excellent.
791;The dialogue can be witty, but there are scenes that are closer to slapstick in some aspects.
792;It is a very modern film noir.
793;The plot will keep you guessing while the dialogue will make you laugh.
794;It was pretty dark, but that's what made it so great!I would highly recommend it if you like:.
795;A very, very funny good time.
796;We liked it so much that we watched it twice in direct succession.
797;And loved it both times!The chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. is wonderful.
798;Loved the movie and fast shipping.
799;Kiss kiss, bang bang is a great comedy and must see movie
800;Keeps you on your toes and very funny indeed.
801;Robert Downey Jr. is darn funny along with Val Kimler.
802;I can't rave enough about how great this movie is!
803;the storyline and acting are phenomenal, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.
804;This movie is a suspense.
805;mystery with plenty of wit and humor thrown in to keep you guessing as to what will happen next.
806;Just the right size to add lots of sparkle to her day!
807;It was a great movie and plot!
808;This movie was interesting because the acting was so good and it had many twists and turns to the story line.
809;I enjoyed it and have already recommended it to a friend.
810;This was just a good laugh.
811;I didn't think I would like it, but I really enjoyed the silly laughs.
812;It's semi comedy with a little mystery in it.
813;Fabulous film, very interestingly done.
814;Robert Downey Jr. is just terrific, as well as all the others.
815;I will tell you in very few words what I think.
816;I really enjoyed this movie.
817;Robert Downey jr is outstanding and Val Kilmer is a perfect straight man for him.
818;Highly recommend this, just not for younger viewers due to language and some nudity.
819;Robert Downey Jr was the draw for me, and the film was well done.
820;The movie starts out slow but it is worth it.
821;This duo should do more movies together.
822;You will love this movie.
823;Robert Downey, Jr is a blast in this movie.
824;Funny, smart, interesting and just a blast to watch over and over.
825;One oft favorite Robert Downey Junior movies.
826;I love the way it is done in a film noir type mode with him as a narrator.
827;this movie is full of fast paced witty diallog (val kilner is amazing as the sarcasticly witty gay perry).
828;And for it's snappy dialog it is well worth whatching.
829;But it also trys to show the drak side of life in hollywood, and in this it also suceeds.
830;classic la tale with sharp wit, good plot, and familiar characters .
831;robert Downey (though coked out) plays it perfectly, and Val is priceless as Perry
832;This movie is soooo funny!!!
833;My husband and I were looking for something fun for a snowy winter afternoon, and this totally filled the bill.
834;A face paced funny movie.
835;Shall be intellectually funny .
836;This is a smart, funny movie, which shouldn't be a surprise considering that the writer of Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout wrote it.
837;Witty dialog and serious scenes that have a humorus twist make this a fun movie.
838;rDJ and Val Kilmer have great chemistry, they're obviously enjoying themselves and they give great performances.
839;This is one movie I'd love a sequel to, or maybe just the actors teaming up again in another movie.
840;the commentary is as much fun as the movie, they're not always commenting on the movie so much as having fun, but there is a lot of insight to the film and behind the scenes goodies.
841;The movie is good if it's a snowy day and you have nothing to do but snuggle on the couch and watch movies.
842;But it's a great flick if you enjoy dark humor.
843;It is the best movie I have ever seen.
844;Everything is perfect That's all I can say
845;Romantic, witty and just great fun.
846;A bit of gratuitous sex and violence, but still very enjoyable.
847;Awesome this is classic Downey jr.
848;Keeps you laughing all movie long.
849;Great night time movie Val Kilmer is in his funniest
850;This movie is a lot of fun but don't expect, well, anything you might expect.
851;"Just let go and enjoy Robert Downey Jr. in his first role after leaving prison
852;The plot is a modern vision of a film noir without the noir, just old.
853;I enjoyed the eclectic, mixed up, characters.
854;All my patience paid off as the remaining portion snapped together with a unique, action of fact, ending.
855;Downey's line delivery is perfect in every scene.
856;Hands down, this is the most entertaining film I've seen in the past two or three years.
857;I laughed out loud several times .
858;The gags in this film are mostly situational, well thought out and come from the hand of a writer who obviously worked very hard to come up with something that is truly funny.
859;if you liked Guy (Mr Madonna) Ritchie's """"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"""" and """"Snatch"""" You are going to love this."""
860;Had no idea what this movie was about, but it turned out to be pretty funny, very entertaining, recommend it.
861;Hard to follow the storyline!With all the great stars in it, we were expecting to be entertained.
862;I will nnot recomend this movie.
863;Excellent movie, comedy with wit.
864;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are excellent together.
865;Michelle Monaghan steals every scene she is in, an oscar worthy performance!
866;This movie is such a great experience.
867;Well written, fast paced, witty .
868;it has everything I love in a movie.
869;top for the mass audience, but I love his love for film and talent for dialogue which are on display in his directorial debut.
870;"i found ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" to be a real treat for cinema."
871;"philes who like smart characters and a bit of the ""breaking the fourth wall"" feel."
872;"The ""LA flare"" and the fact that the actors seem to be having so much fun made this a fun view for me."
873;RDJ and Val Kilmer (who steals a few scenes of his own) are great together, and Michelle Monaghan was witty, fun and nice to look at.
874;This is the kind of fun film experience I enjoy and miss in the garbage they churn out in Hollywood now .
875;I absolutely loved this movie.
876;Loved the dry pan humor.
877;Val Kilmer was pretty cool too!
878;On average I have probably watched 3 movies a day for every day I have been alive, and this is by far the most hilarious film I have EVER seen.
879;It is action packed, sexy, and funny .
880;Val Kilmer is at his best.
881;to top it off, it is one of the best mystery who.
882;The script is entertainingly witty.
883;I watched it because of Downey, Kilmer and the other well known actors.
884;If you've never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie in your life, this is the film to pick up and watch.
885;He cries, he gets the role.
886;He can pause the film and fill you in on the background, remind you about something that happened previously in the film, or hilariously rewind the movie.
887;The one liners in this movie are hilarious.
888;Basically every line that comes from Robert and Val's lips are nearly always funny.
889;There's lots of trademarks in this .
890;He's cool, he's a 'good' criminal, and he makes the audience root for him.
891;, and the two actors have perfect chemistry together, and they probably had a laugh off screen as well as on.
892;It's definitely one I'll be looking out for, cheap, as the one liners are quick and witty, and the actors are amazing in it.
893;Also, it'll be good if I can figure out (and remember) the twists and turns before they come this time.
894;"This is screenwriter (""Lethal Weapon"") Shane Black's first film as director and he is very keen on making the most of this opportunity: the 3rd wall is smashed and cleared away, the story is told both in flash backs and in flash forwards and Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart narrates in deadpan fashion that manages to be extremely witty and droll on the one hand and banal and silly at others."
895;moving closer to actually nabbing the movie role.
896;And so it goes: one incredible and often hilarious plot twist after another.
897;downey, always a charming performer and who may be a bit too old for this part, in that he is supposed to be the same age as the smart, funny and adorable Michelle Monaghan who plays his childhood friend, Harmony Faith Lane.
898;This movie is one of my top 15 movies of all time.
899;Shane Black has a knack for writing fantastic dialog, and it was amazing to watch this comeback film for Robert Downey Jr. (3 years ahead of Iron Man).
900;The plot is full of twists, the acting is amazing, and I even love the voiceovers.
901;Kilmer and Downey, Jr. give fantastic performances as does the gorgeous Monaghan in this great film which deliver some outrageous hilarious moments and yes I'm talking about the peeing scene which I admit I laughed.
902;Don't worry, I saw Lord of the Rings.
903;KISS KISS BANG BANG is one heck of a good movie.
904;Writer/director Shane Black who burst onto the scene with LETHAL WEAPON has created a film that pokes fun at the very genre which made him famous.
905;Its complex but sensible plot takes lots of twists and turns and holds your interest throughout.
906;There are some wonderfully creative scenes especially when Harry (our hero) decides to play Russian roulette with a bad guy orderly.
907;The casting is superb: Robert Downey Jr. is marvelous as the reluctant hero who finds himself caught up in a complex web of deception, murder and everything else.
908;He's also given a very witty narrative that aids rather than hinders the action.
909;Kilmer's comic timing is wonderfully controlled.
910;"I really enjoyed this movie
911;Great plot twists and turns, the right amount of comedy and drama combined!
912;A friend recommended watching this, I was Not disappointed.
913;It was hilarious and a good mystery type of movie that kept me glued to the screen.
914;beat?And Val Kilmer rocks in this movie.
915;This movie is just a good one.
916;epic dialogue, great storyline, fun with sarcastic tone.
917;Quirky and loved the non conventionla approach to a Hollywood murder mystery!
918;Entertaining enough for a cold afternoon when nothing better is on TV.
919;I wouldn't pay for it however, so it was worth it with Prime.
920;I have been a fan of this film for a few years and was happy to learn that it was available for Blu.
921;The film is well worth it"
922;Great story that keeps you guessing!
923;i'm talking to you, California one.
924;just be cool and remember nobody has a monopoly on wisdom.
925;"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a comedic murder mystery written and directed by Shane Black, based in part on the novel ""Bodies are Where You Find Them"" by Brett Halliday."
926;It honors and spoofs many of the stylistic conventions of film noir and hard.
927;The titles that introduce each chapter as the mystery unfolds are titles of Raymond Chandler stories.
928;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang has some fun moments.
929;It sends up both film noir and Hollywood culture but seems to be primarily concerned with getting laughs.
930;People have a relatively sophisticated view of these subjects at this point.
931;The actors are 10 years apart and look it.
932;Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.
933;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
934;This is one of those rare and delightful films that gets noir and also has no problem whatsoever stretching the genre and making fun of it.
935;Kilmer and Downey are unusually well paired in their love/hate relationship.
936;But the best part is the narrative flow and how it ties into the story yet is still surprising and/or humorous.
937;Lots of jokes about LA people, especially women in entertainment.
938;The dialog between Robert and Val is the best.
939;The twists and turns are nice too, but Robert really steals the show.
940;Great movie full of dialogue that is simultaneously cheesy and witty.
941;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang gets better each time you watch it.
942;Downey always pleases and entertains and he does not fail in this flick.
943;The action is great and a very interesting story line, however, pay close attention to the line as it is, at times, convoluted.
944;Great acting by all with fine dry comedy suffused with murders.
945;It has many very nicely crafted and clever punchlines that will make you burst out in laughter.
946;"Bought as a gift
947;It's a decent action comedy where Robert Downey Jr. plays himself (not literally, but, you know, plays his sarcastic, lucky, cocky, ruggedly handsome, edgy dude like in Iron Man.
948;some good action and comedic scenes for this crime.
949;Robert Downey Jr. is simply brilliant.
950;Val Kilmer is a perfect foil to Downey's character as well, and I was reminded again of why he was so adored in the 80's.
951;If you like dry humor with a side of murder"
952;A dark and wonderfully inventive story line by action screenwriter Shane Blackalso making his masterful directorial debutand excellent performances from Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan make Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a greatly entertaining ride.
953;Funny and interesting, Haha Val Kilmer was great.
954;I usually stick to thrillers, this was a good movie!
955;Would definitely recommend to anyone.
956;I had a lot of fun watching this film, and laughed out loud more than I have in a long time.
957;"Val Kilmer and Robert Downey, Jr. are at the top of their game
958;They were enjoying themselves when they made this film, and it shows!
959;Nothing brilliant, nothing profound, just well.
960;made solid madcap dark laughter enjoyment.
961;Downey and Kilmer are in top form in this exceptionally well written and incredibly funny neo.
962;If you like quirky, self aware, and slightly dark films like """"The Opposite of Sex"""" or Jay Mohr's shortlived TV show, """"Action,"""" you should love this!"""
963;Robert Downey played his character well though it was so much going on you finally catch up to speed and it was just a great comedy.
964;"Satiring many of the conventions of the action movie genre that he helped create
965;Black does a wonderful job, and his cast is even better as they are clearly enjoying themselves"
966;Mix well and pour into a glass iced with the spirit of the Thin Man.
967;A modern Film Noir style flick that walks you through a series of improbable events to deliver a fun, if at times disturbing, piece of entertainment.
968;Lightweight movie, but lots of fun.
969;So if you are in the mood for a fun, up.
970;beat movie, without too much substance or depth, go for it, and you will be entertained.
971;there are some clever scenes in there and a bit sexy (as a film).
972;which is a good thing.
973;Its been a long time since I watched this movie but the dialogue is great, the movie is humorous, but still has enough going on to keep action junkies watching.
974;great movie that will keep you laughing.
975;In some ways is a much more realistic look at how a regular guy would react if he was suddenly involved in murder and intrige.
976;Loved the narrative by Downey, and Kilmer played a surprisingly great sidekick character.
977;Thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely recommend watching.
978;Quirky, sometimes offensive, often hilarious film that we watched because it was on several underrated film lists.
979;"Not your average black comedy
980;unusual juxtaposition of comedic elements.
981;As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes.
982;Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard.
983;I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing.
984;Entertaining, but it is a spoof.
985;Got it free with prime, so I'm happy.
986;This movie is big big fun fun!
987;It has comedy, thrills, romance, mystery and some of the greatest dialogue to come out of Hollywood in years.
988;Good movie though not great.
989;A Downey Jr. vehicle and he shines.
990;it's a noir satire, L. a movie biz satire, L. a. satire with the best performances by both the lead actors ever given.
991;Bring a box of kleenex for the tears of laughter.
992;I'm not a Robert Downey fan but he gives a good performance in a verywell written movie.
993;Supporting actors add to the flavor of this film.
994;a must see if your a mystery/comedy fan.
995;The Bottom Line:A wonderfully funny movie for people who have seen too many movies and know every single cliche, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is often accused of being """"too clever by half"""" but let me be the one to assure you that its cleverness and wit are distinct virtues"
996;This film is VERY well done.
997;Reasonably good plot, VERY good acting, and strongly written dialogue for the actor's to work with.
998;It's got a certain something that sets it apart from the other movies in the same genre.
999;Val is amazing as always, this time playing homosexual detective/hollywood consultant, Big Gay Perry, and in my opinion, is utterly hilarious.
1000;two of my favorite actors in one film, incorporating just enough suspense and plenty of humor throughout that will make this a movie you'll wanna watch again and again, if only for the hilarious one liners (there are plenty of them!)
1001;"best watched with a mature audience
1002;Actors are very good and story is complicated enough.
1003;If you're a fan, you'll love this movie.
1004;If you weren't before this, you will be.
1005;Well acted for the most part.
1006;I am learning to enjoy Robert Downey Jr. more and more.
1007;I think we can safely classify this as a dark comedy.
1008;But after watching this movie I absolutely love it.
1009;This movie is so clever and witty and the story is fantastic.
1010;Each actor plays their part very well and some of the scenes between Downey and Kilmer are hilarious.
1011;One thing that I liked about this movie is the way that it sort of makes fun of itself and movies like it.
1012;Shane Black's directorial debut is the sort of film that one can enjoy immensely as long as one is willing to go along for the ride.
1013;That ride has to take place somewhere"
1014;driven culture of Los Angeles appears to the rest of the civilized world, I can understand and appreciate that skewed angle underwater.
1015;harmony captures Harry's locked heart.
1016;whatKiss Kiss Bang Bangdoes best is that it allows the protagonist to befriend the audience, and it is for that admittedly subjective reason that I love this film.
1017;heartedly recommend getting the blu.
1018;Not only is the cinematography top notch, but the color treatment of the 35mm film is absolutely one of the most beautiful treatments I've ever seen!
1019;Fueled by adrenalin and sorrow at the loss of his partner he nails the audition.
1020;It turns out she is the one that got away.
1021;Harmony's past and Gay Perry's detective lesson turn into mysteries that intersect.
1022;this movie was a very pleasant surprise.
1023;the good: This movie is all about the dialogue and the way it is delivered was great.
1024;Val Kilmer delivers his lines in a deadpan, sarcastic manner which was very funny.
1025;The exchanges between Downer Jr and Monaghan were entertaining as well.
1026;The story although slightly convoluted towards the end was actually strong.
1027;As long as you don't go into it expecting Oscar gold or something that is intended to be taken 100% seriously you should enjoy this movie.
1028;The dialogue is extremely witty!
1029;All actors do a great job.
1030;Story line is very effective4 in moving the plot along.
1031;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a funny and fun movie with a murder.
1032;This is one of Val Kilmer's best performances.
1033;The chemistry between him and Robert Downey, Jr. is fantastic.
1034;They make a great comedy team.
1035;But it all ties together in a great ending.
1036;val kilmer i pretty much like.
1037;it's a bit disconcerting seeing him with his new filled out face.
1038;well, for THAT matter, i'll go as far as to say that i wish this movie were divest of everything else happening in it other than the presence of michelle.
1039;i STILL liked the movie.
1040;This movie is very quick,clever, and darkly funny.
1041;It has a satiric hollywood insider view of people making films and of private detectives.
1042;It features Robert Downey Jr. playing a petty smartalec thief who is mistaken for both an actor and a P. i.,helped by a real gumshoe(played gay by Val Kilmer),it's a hoot!
1043;My used copy played and looked good.
1044;Lovely use of plot and characters really lovely performances from all actors.
1045;Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr are great together.
1046;it had a few laughs though.
1047;I have always loved this movie.
1048;If you havent seen it def check it out!
1049;jr does a great job as always
1050;My wife and I were looking for something light to watch one evening and this was a nice surprise.
1051;Great movie, especially if you're a fan of dark comedy.
1052;A very entertaining murder mystery with stellar performances by Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Val Kilmer.
1053;Well I was pleasantly surprised by Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang.
1054;Val Kilmer was so witty and I was glad to see him honing his comedic timing again.
1055;I like his brooding roles but I felt like his comedy had been overlooked for many years and this was the perfect venue to get him back into it.
1056;Robert Downey Jr. is also very funny and endearing and I forgot what a great actor he is.
1057;If you like either actor, you'll love this film.
1058;Great plot, suspenseful, funny and thought provoking.
1059;The movie made me laugh.
1060;Amazingly enough some movies stay with you after you watch it on screen.
1061;sharp witted commentary through the movie keeps you laughing, and unexpected twists and turns makes you scream.
1062;Especially the dog scene was amazing.
1063;The cast, the writing, and the direction were more than enough to turn unrealistic into fun on screen.
1064;He turns in a very enjoyable performance as Harry Lockhart.
1065;When you watch the movie you wonder if he can sustain the exalted level of sarcastic wit and incredible timing.
1066;Some credit is due to Robert Downey, Jr. for his part in how well they worked together, but Val was great.
1067;This just might be his best performance, if I may be so bold.
1068;"The writing was probably the best part
1069;It was a unique film and I appreciate seeing something that is a break from the norm, especially when it is as funny and fun to watch as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
1070;when I read the title: Kiss, Kiss.
1071;I will promise you THAT you will laugh very very loud!
1072;This is a detective story that has a lot of twists in the movie.
1073;This is Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. best work and if you asked them they tell you the same thing.
1074;It's a rollorcoaster of entertainment a must for you collection.
1075;While Downey played his usual part, he was entertaining as always.
1076;A little hard to keep up with at first but it comes together very well in the end for a couple unexpected twists.
1077;A very clever script, brilliantly brought to life by a terrific cast.
1078;I was very happy to see him in top of his form.
1079;Michelle Monaghan is just right as Downey's love interest.
1080;She's good hearted and cute and really dumb at times (manages to cut off Downey's finger) and brilliant and heroic at other times.
1081;I'd love to see a sequal with the two of them.
1082;the dialog is as clever and snappy as anything you'll find in a 30's screwball comedy and there are some hilarious sight gags.
1083;I loved it when Downey finds himself under the table with the pink.
1084;The three stars are so compelling that the plot just serves as a vehicle for watching them do their stuff.
1085;I had more genuine laughs here than at anything I've seen in quite a while.
1086;It was okay, but I wouldn't ever recommend it to a friend or watch it again.
1087;It is very quirky, but also very, very funny.
1088;I would recommend this movie to anyone with an oddball senseof humor.
1089;Great performance by Robert Downey jr, found myself laughing loudly several times throughout the movie
1090;Loved this movie and completely recommend it.
1091;it's pretty wild, and can't really think of any other movie to compare it to, but it's absolutely worth watching.
1092;I didn't know what to expect before watching it, but I'm a big fan of both Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr and they teamed up well.
1093;When I think of the movie I automatically just want to laugh and have recommended it to a lot of people.
1094;It is a must see!
1095;Good fun film from director of iron man 3 and writer of die hard, last Boy Scout and leathal weapons.
1096;Also one the last good performances from Val Kilmer.
1097;This is ultimately a story about friendship.
1098;robert Downey, Jr. not only stars in the film, he does the narration and gives his usual excellent performance in both.
1099;while I expected great performances from these two actors, the surprise performance of the movie for me was Michelle Monaghan, as I'd not previously been familiar with her work and she does a very credible job of a 34ish actress in LA trying to make it in the entertainment business.
1100;The scrip is witty, the direction spot on and the casting is perfect.
1101;Worth you time and very entertaining.
1102;fashioned detective movie that makes fun of itself the entire way through.
1103;We thought that with the high caliber of actors it would be worth seeing.
1104;This movie is a must own if you like a good mystery with very funny dry subtle humor.
1105;Kilmer and JR. are a great duo together.
1106;this is an old movie that is a bit quirky but very watchable Val Kilmer is very funny and the story is crazy
1107;Instant classic!RDJr at his finest, Val Kilmer is great in this flick as well, highly recommend to anyone who wants an enjoyable night in with their SO.
1108;A nice surprise and a story that just keeps going.
1109;Downey nails his character and Kilmer was great as well.
1110;2005 was 8 years ago, and it was a time in life when I had a lot of personal woes, so I may have missed a few good movies.
1111;Great fun for popcorn, drinking or date.
1112;Then I see one of his good movies, and the late eighties come flooding back.
1113;This month, though, I've laughed more at movies than I have in the past year.
1114;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was half the reason.
1115;Kilmer and Downey are great foils for one another, and both have very good timing here.
1116;Add in a few overly weird minor characters and the mother of all Rube Goldbergian plots, and you've got yourself a winner.
1117;fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill: It's a Class.
1118;if that seems like an easy feat, well.
1119;out great performance that keeps up with the veterans.
1120;a. kind) is the phrase that best describes """"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"""" although it's remarkably mainstream at times."""
1121;It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here and social commentary to boot.
1122;I thought it would be good.
1123;But it is a stpid move.
1124;First time ever seeing this movie this week.
1125;"As its title suggests, """"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a film noir spoof whose energy and style compensate for its overall dearth of laughs."
1126;writer/director Shane Blake has a great time lampooning not merely the conventions of film noir and Chandler.
1127;"there's no denying that ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is a high energy lark, filled with creativity and imagination and featuring sharp performances from Downey Jr., Kilmer, Monaghan and a whole host of excellent supporting players."
1128;paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L. a. derived fiction.
1129;Surprisingly witty dialogue and dynamic play between Kilmer and Downey and leading lady.
1130;Either I slept through 2005 and missed this movie or it was off my radar, but I was unexpectedly delighted by this flick.
1131;Its believable and relatable dialogue makes it a classic in my book.
1132;Gay Perry is my favorite character.
1133;Watching Val Kilmer's character is a funny experience.
1134;Is great as the main character.
1135;It has a touch of Noire feeling to it.
1136;This is a wacky mystery that keeps your attention and take you on a fun ride .
1137;Though something with Downey might be good.
1138;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I know a lot of people agree.
1139;written movies, this is one.
1140;Pick this movie up now at a great price.
1141;liked the actors a lot.
1142;Buddycop movie with a difference.
1143;Hilarious and def worth watching.
1144;The ending will surprise you and you sure will be laughing the whole time
1145;One of RDJ's best movies also written and directed by Shane Black who made Lethal Weapon and is directing Iron Man 3.
1146;And a great layered mystery with voice over misdirection.
1147;Well I bought this movie based purely on the fact that Robert Downey Jr is in it, because I have thanks to Iron Man become a little obsessed with him and I'm just crazy that way, but it turned out to be really good.
1148;It was funny and the whole story within a story thing worked out really well.
1149;Even the commentary, which I don't usually watch was really funny.
1150;I thought, sure, I'll watch it.
1151;I only enjoyed this and the first Hangover films because I could care less about such films.
1152;Great performances, even from Val Kilmer, who I've heard little about.
1153;pretty racy and a lot of cussing, but it's hilarious.
1154;This is one of those films you need to see more than once because the story and the performances are nuanced and original.
1155;action movie with great performances and unexpected twists.
1156;One of the better performances of late from Val Kilmer (also see Spartan) and features a very funny Robert Downey at his best.
1157;See this movie, on Blu if possible.
1158;He's not Ironman but the personality is much the same, Michelle Monaghan is drop dead gorgeous, and Val Kilmer is at his best.
1159;fast,but is resolved quite well
1160;Although not meant to be a real comedy, I laughed a lot.
1161;Hard to follow but enjoyable in the end.
1162;Fun movie and why wouldn't it be given the reliable actors cast.
1163;After what seemed to be a slow start this turned out to be an interesting and funny movie with enough action and twists to keep my attention.
1164;"Shane Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" is about as profound as its title ."
1165;"I always enjoy Downey, but my favorite performance of his came in Curtis Hanson's ""Wonder Boys."""
1166;"in ""KKBB,"" Downey plays a perfect Downey character, Harry Lockhart."
1167;intrepid souls dig deeper into these mysteries, Lockhart also serves as the Narrator, giving the audience plenty of information and laughs at the same time.
1168;"ultimately, ""KKBB"" is too witty to be a great movie ."
1169;"destined to become a cult hit, ""KKBB"" is a must for fans of trashy movies."
1170;Straight from the Quentin Tarantino school, this is a movie to be enjoyed with good friends, greasy food, and cheap alcohol.
1171;I love the dynamic between the actors and the old school detective story.
1172;I can't recommend this movie enough to people I meet.
1173;It's fast, witty dialogue is spot on and Downey and Kilmer are brilliant together.
1174;The moment I finished it for the first time I immediately started it again to try and catch more of he wit and humor.
1175;I still find something new each time I watch it.
1176;Also, Robert Downy Jr is hawt in this movie!
1177;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is hard to place in a genre, and I think that is a good thing.
1178;The film is comedic, dramatic, and has plenty of action, as such it is sure to satisfy most viewers.
1179;This film features stellar performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer who bring a good sense of humor to the screen.
1180;The story is well told, although some may find it a little convoluted.
1181;This film is good fun and I would recommend to fans of most genres.
1182;Great performance by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer!
1183;A good movie even if you're not a fan of action.
1184;5 star rating is due to the fact I had no idea what a fun ride this flick would be.
1185;R. downey Jr and Val K are terrific.
1186;Funny, action packed, bromance, LA noir.
1187;all packed into one punch.
1188;The cast is good (Val Kilmer, Robert Downey Jr., and Michelle Monaghan), and there is genuine chemistry between the three.
1189;Gunfire, bodies here and there, a car chase, a goofy bed time scene, a whiff of incest that is delivered in the most ho.
1190;Robert Downey Jr is above this script.
1191;This movie kept our attention.
1192;It was gripping and funny.
1193;It is easy to appreciate that Shane Black has made some of the classic action genre movies and was playing off that in KKBB.
1194;One reviewer stated Black threw everything but the kitchen sink in and that hits the mark perfectly.
1195;this movie is quite funny if have a weird sense of humor.
1196;A laugh a minute, great actors together.
1197;If you like odd films then this is worth watching.
1198;I really enjoyed the humor of this film.
1199;Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role, as were Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.
1200;The three had fantastic chemistry and every scene showed that synergy.
1201;I loved the layers of the murder mystery allying goofball antics and smart twists.
1202;Color also played an important role in the film.
1203;esque scenes enhanced the edginess of the dark comedy.
1204;Downey's narration was consistently amusing.
1205;This film's ability to mock itself made every scene move the plot at a pretty intense pace.
1206;As I am wont to love, really smart lines abound.
1207;It is unfortunate that this is the fate of such a fine film.
1208;kilter humor and fanciful cinematography.
1209;This was a lucky find for some great lines and great laughs!
1210;That Kilmer and Downey have many good flix to their credit helped the choice along.
1211;This was light slapstick funny in places and overall a great way to diddle away an evening!!
1212;A gripping and somewhat funny thriller that beat my expectations.
1213;Sex, laughs, whodunit for an enjoyable evening with friends over beer.
1214;I saw this on tv and wanted a copy to be able to show others.
1215;Would not recommend It to my friends today.
1216;Plus I really enjoy any movie with Robert Downey jr!
1217;Excellent, intelligent and unique plot.
1218;Great actors and all with great chemistry.
1219;A true dark comedy or maybe film noir with a dash of comedy.
1220;He is right, and I don't understand anyone who thought this was actually a good movie.
1221;This movie was original and I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
1222;and two great actors that play flawlessly.
1223;I still think you might enjoy it.
1224;The movie was funny and the story line was awesome!
1225;Would definitely recommend and will watch again!
1226;I'd recommend it to anyone.
1227;"discovered RDJ in ""Iron Man"" this summer."
1228;This movie is surprisingly good with plenty of witty dialog and smart one.
1229;I don't remember this film getting a ton of attention when it was in theatres, but it's pretty great.
1230;The chemistry between Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan is really fun to watch.
1231;Have loved watching it ever since.
1232;I loved the dark comedy in this gritty film.
1233;RDJ began his comeback with this film, and chose a great anti.
1234;Well truth be told I'm a Robert Downey Jr fan but found this movie highly entertaining and very well done.
1235;Very clever who dunnit movie with interesting plot twists and witty banter.
1236;Robert Downey's ongoing commentary is consistently hilarious as he is beaten up, beaten down (and mutilated).
1237;If you like his Sherlock Holmes or Ironman character you'll enjoy this movie.
1238;This movie is a very funny movie.
1239;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are, as always, pleasures to be entertained by.
1240;The real treat, though, is the wacko performance by Michelle Monaghan!
1241;Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout) is one of the smartest writers in the action genre, and in this, his debut as a director, he knocks it out of the park.
1242;It's the perfect example of what you might call post.
1243;modernism: thoroughly aware of what it is (silly intrigue.
1244;laden romantic buddy thriller), and kidding about it, but in the end it turns out to be a pretty effective example.
1245;Robert Downey Jr. is very well used, Val Kilmer is a great foil, Michelle Monaghan is the heart.
1246;melting love interest, and the photography, for a low.
1247;I expect to be watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang many more times just for the pleasure of spending more hours in the company of these characters.
1248;The mixing of comedy, action, romance, mystery and probably a few more genre distracted from a good story.
1249;I always ove Robert Downey Jr. and he is the main reason I chose the film.
1250;I enjoyed his narration of the story.
1251;I chose it because it has Robert Downey Jr in it.
1252;Good movie for a night in
1253;Robert Downey Jr. makes a good narrator.
1254;Sometimes serious, more times funny, it covers a number of bases well.
1255;robert and Val work well together.
1256;I'm always quoting this movie.
1257;This is a movie that has a lot of comedic depth.
1258;Robert Downey is hilarious and charming in a non.
1259;backs to the past events that occur through introduction by Downey (until he explains them), but that's the flavor and the point of the movie.
1260;All actrs were good and the story was very engaging.
1261;I thought that this movie was an excellent performance by Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer.
1262;The storyline was sharp and witty with visceral characters and great acting the whole way through.
1263;I highly recommend it for anyone that loves dark humor.
1264;Enjoyed the constant surprises presented in the movie.
1265;Must have an open mind to view.
1266;Would be a tough job to act in, but these guys really hit the mark.
1267;Downey and Kilmer are amazing in this film!
1268;The comedy was sharp and witty.
1269;A fun time will be had by all who watch this movie!
1270;Be assured his wisecracking wit is in full view the entire film.
1271;"He does a great job in the role, have never seen him in a bad film
1272;I highly recommend this film.
1273;Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black made his directorial debut with this film, and has obviously done some serious soul.
1274;searching during his ten year hiatus, since """"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"""" pokes fun at the standards he helped set during the big."""
1275;He's also the film's narrator, and does several amusing Adaptation.
1276;"After a while, the silliest thing becomes Black's lack of confidence in the material, since ""Kiss Kiss"" is actually a pretty solid detective story."
1277;Saying much more would spoil the film, just know all the performances are good, and the characterization is far more developed than any of Black's previous works (Though his writing still suffers with his treatment of female characters).
1278;this is sure to please!
1279;discovering unexpected twists and turns as they team up.
1280;This is a great movie !!!
1281;I took a chance on it, based on the fine cast and screenplay/direction by Shane Black, and was totally impressed.
1282;The dialog was unusually intricate and hilarious, requiring your full attention, while the situations and plot twists were relentlessly original and clever.
1283;but the overall tone is one of black humor and witty repartee.
1284;Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are at their best, and are matched beautifully by newcomer Michelle Monaghan.
1285;I believe this was her first movie, but she dominates the screen like a seasoned pro.
1286;the five chapter titles are derived from Raymond Chandler detective stories, and much of the plot is a witty parody of the style and conformities of these noir classics.
1287;"She declared that the the four words of the title (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) ""are perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies""."
1288;If you are a fan of black humor, noir detective tales, and clever, intelligent dialog then I strongly recommend that you give this movie a try.
1289;It is a gem !!!
1290;Always a pleasure to watch and likewise with Val Kilmner to keep up the interest.
1291;Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang is a crime noir/buddy comedy that is much better than I expected it to be going in.
1292;Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. have a great chemistry, and the director Shane Black, guides the movie with tongue firmly in cheek.
1293;The entire supporting cast is very good as well.
1294;This movie has a little bit of everything and it has undeniable style.
1295;This is movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was scared when it dropped off the face of the earth.
1296;Everything from the story to the actors is amazing and i wouldn't change a thing.
1297;Robert Downey Jr. plays Robert Downey Jr. like only he can, while Val Kilmer turns in a hilarious and nuanced performance as a gay private investigator.
1298;Good performances by Robert and Val.
1299;Plenty of twists in the story.
1300;Good action packed movie with nice comdic touch.
1301;Downey and Kilmer are good togetherIt was good It was good it was good
1302;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is the latest offering from former wunderkind Shane Black.
1303;"In ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"", Black reteams with his former producer Joel Silver, and directs his own screenplay, a homage (or some might say a parody) of Film Noir."
1304;The producers are so impressed that they fly him to Hollywood to do a second audition.
1305;i'm all for clever films.
1306;The best mysteries let you in on a little of the secret and allow you to figure it out as you go along.
1307;"All of the clues should be there
1308;Maybe on the second viewing, you understand how they fit and you appreciate the film for including everything.
1309;It is the type of clever a film writer or director wants to be to prove how good they are, how witty, how funny.
1310;Kiss has some funny lines, but the writer and director are so intent on making us `laugh' and so intent on proving how `witty' they are, that the film suffers.
1311;From the first frame, Harry's narration brings attention to the fact that we are watching a film, about an actor, in Hollywood.
1312;Yes, this is funny, to a point, because it serves to call attention to some of the conventions of the genre.
1313;But it gets real old, real quick.
1314;Who cares?This """"wink, wink, nudge, nudge"""" look at Hollywood overlaps a mystery."""
1315;Remember what I said about clever films and mysteries that actually have everything there?
1316;It wants to be a clever film about Hollywood.
1317;Yet, we never see actually see the action or the clues.
1318;robert Downey, Jr. certainly works very hard to make Harold seem like a real human.
1319;In some scenes, he actually takes a breath and tries to hold the gaze of Harmony or to talk to Perry as a normal human being.
1320;Perry reaches into his pants.
1321;This continues for what seems years until Perry shoots him with the small gun he keeps in his underwear.
1322;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang has some funny lines and references, but you will have to wade through a lot of insider jokes and a poorly constructed mystery to get to them.
1323;maybe it's because the movie itself is so unexpectedly quirky from beginning to end, full of characters your gut tells you aren't that likable, but nonetheless you like them.
1324;good guy Harry, et al.
1325;the acting is spectacular, particularly Downey.
1326;Kilmer is solid and restrained, making his character believably gay yet masculine.
1327;The supporting characters all have perfect dark comedic timing.
1328;It takes a brave director to take whacks at himself.
1329;If you like Robert Downy Jr. you will like this movie.
1330;If you love Robert Downy you will absolutely love this movie.
1331;RDJ at his finest with solid support from a gay Iceman Val Kilmer.
1332;The girl is pretty good too.
1333;Strange to describe other than sort of a caper film set against modern LA, with fantastic performances by Kilmer, RDJ, and others.
1334;I have to admit, Robert Downey, Jr. does a fantastic job of playing a stumble.
1335;My wife was entertained, If you can do that without the More gushing tears then That was enough for me.
1336;It was great fun, and Robert Downey Jr. was genius, as usual.
1337;We had a great time the other week seeing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a fun and clever take on Raymond Chandler.
1338;Impressively, the film succeeds in being both a pastiche and a parody of film noir at the same time.
1339;Instead, the characters often traded witty barbs, and the script mined the rich vein of ironic potential in taking the 1940's genre and relocating it to the present day.
1340;This clever device allowed the movie to be alternately suspenseful and funny without breaking the mood.
1341;shelled homosexual detective, and Michelle Monaghan is great as the lost hometown girl gone to Hollywood.
1342;Definitely check out this clever comedy.
1343;A 'knockabout' entertaining thriller, which pays homage to film noir.
1344;There's plenty of humour, plus the benefit of great chemistry between Kilmer and Downey.
1345;"An interesting movie taking a simple movie cliche of mixed identity, combined with a detective mystery straight out of a pulp novel, the best part of the movie is the dialogue between the characters Harry (Robert Downey, Jr.) and ""Gay"" Perry (Val Kilmer, is one of his most memorable roles to date)."
1346;man's action/mystery movie, then this is perfect for you on any night.
1347;When we could hear and understand the lines, it seemed to be a humorous story .
1348;but with a dark sense of humor.
1349;Cannot recommend it to anyone.
1350;but still love the two leads.
