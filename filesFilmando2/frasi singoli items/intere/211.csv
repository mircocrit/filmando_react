1;One is a crook, and the other is now a thief.
2;this movie is so well done, and wonderfully classic.
3;Cagney gives one of, if not the, greatest performances of his life.
4;This is one of my favorite classics.
5;i think this movie is really wonderful, and actually quite touching.
6;this was my introduction to james cagney, and he is now one of my fave actors,and it has become my favorite movie.
7;it's also nice to see such a young Bogie.
8;The film has action, suspense, drama, romance and even a little comedy (very little, but it's there).
9;Alas, the film is strong enough to survive, and survive it has.
10;Rocky and Jerry are best friends, both stirring up trouble on their block when Rocky winds up taking the fall for a robbery gone wrong.
11;the film is a beautiful (albeit tragic) look at loyalty.
12;Separated for fifteen years, Jerry and Rocky are still remarkably loyal to one another despite their separate paths in life.
13;The greatest arc comes at the films finale, which may be one of my favorite closing sequences put to film.
14;I know those sound like total contradictions, but watch and you will see.
15;those tears on Father Jerry's face echoed my own.
16;the performances here are ridiculously good, for the most part.
17;At least she was attractive.
18;The men here, including the slew of young actors, all nailed their roles.
19;James Cagney deserved the Oscar nom he snatched up, for his infectiously conflicted Rocky Sullivan is a noteworthy and memorable screen character.
20;The way he maintains his charisma while building layers of emotional confliction is superb, and that final scene is just a powerhouse for both he and O'Brien.
21;Both he and Cagney are perfect compliments.
22;"There is such paternal warmth that radiates from O'Brien's performance
I:8935;23;in the end this is an action packed drama that layers its characters and its plot enough to constitute as an all around solid film, one that is more than just a generic gangster film but one that shows some real teeth and a lot of heart.
I:8935;24;one of my favorite James Cagney films of all time.
I:8935;25;The most surprising thing about the movie is the performance of James Cagney who completely sheds off his one.
I:8935;26;dimensional personality and goes further to be a human with feelings.
I:8935;27;In short, it's a breakthrough role for him.
I:8935;28;Pat O'Brien, who collaborated with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart in San Quentin, gives another great performance in Angels with Dirty Faces.
I:8935;29;One impressive performance comes in the beginning of Angels with Dirty Faces where Frankie Burke plays the young Rocky Sullivan and makes a great James Cagney impersonation.
I:8935;30;I think that was a very good one.
I:8935;31;Having a vivid memory of the scene from Home Alone, I was hoping that it is from Angels with Dirty Faces but actually found out that it was a spoof with a made.
I:8935;32;The ending of Angels with Dirty Faces is quite good and somewhat powerful, and I love that mile walk shot.
I:8935;33;Now this is a real classic.
I:8935;34;All really classic roles for which these three became famous.
I:8935;35;worship, and takes up with the kids.
I:8935;36;respect, and he's going to spit in the guard's eye.
I:8935;37;I'll give it two stars.
I:8935;38;It's a pretty corny plot in a lot of ways, but it is indeed a historical treasure.
I:8935;39;Cagney is great as usual as the tough as nails, street.
I:8935;40;Again he is a James Cagney fan.
I:8935;41;James Cagney established in this movie the quintessential tough.
I:8935;42;present sneer, fast, clipped talk, """"I'll spit your eye, copper"""" attitude ."""
43;He agrees and the scene is done all in shadows, to great effect.
44;Cagney is riveting in his role, and O'Brien is just right as the priest who accepts Rocky for what he is and doesn't pontificate before him.
45;"A terrific movie
I:8935;46;This is a superb movie.
I:8935;47;Very good old time movie.
I:8935;48;It actually had a moral to it's story.
I:8935;49;Today's filmakers and actors should take note.
I:8935;50;Yankee Doodle Dandy is the most politically correct choice people make as their favorite Cagney movie these days.
I:8935;51;My personal favorite is White Heat but AwDF by far, is Cagney's best acting job.
I:8935;52;They want to believe that Rocky performed a final noble act in an attempt to put the Dead End Kids lives back on the straight and narrow.
I:8935;53;Cagney enjoyed going against his tough gangster image.
I:8935;54;But, that's precisely why so many ask such a superfluous question.
I:8935;55;Of course, the film works mainly because of Cagney's bravura performance.
I:8935;56;It's as good as in other films, and contrasts with O'Brien's portrayal of the priest.
I:8935;57;Cagney got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.
I:8935;58;the first of his career (he would win a few years later with Yankee Doodle Dandy), and it was well deserved, and even won the New York Film Critics Award for best actor.
I:8935;59;This film certainly has an attractive cast with three Hall.
I:8935;60;I am glad to see fellow reviewers here share the love for James Cagney, my favorite classic.
I:8935;61;cagney, as he was prone to do in his career, steals most of the scenes.
I:8935;62;He just dominates the screen and gets you very involved with his character, especially at the end.
I:8935;63;liberal and likable priest role and Humphrey Bogart is convincing as the crooked lawyer.
I:8935;64;chase scene near the end was well.
I:8935;65;done with some great film.
I:8935;66;noir photography and the ending of the movie is quite memorable.
I:8935;67;This is a wonderful movie, especially if you like James Cagney, who was a song and dance man at heart during his life time.
I:8935;68;One of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8935;69;The ending is STILL one of the best of all time!
I:8935;70;The film also draws an extraordinary canvass of the working class milieu to illustrate the squalor that would encourage someone to turn to crime.
I:8935;71;Humphrey Bogart is effective also here as Sullivan's double.
I:8935;72;Credit director Michael Curtiz for pulling all of these elements together for wholly satisfying experience.
I:8935;73;hued performance he is able to allow the audience to empathize with him and mourn for him even though we disagree with his choices in life.
I:8935;74;Service was great and It was a nice surprise instead ofwaiting forever.
I:8935;75;The memorable ending of the film is ambiguous, leaving the viewer to decide whether Cagney dies a hero or a coward.
I:8935;76;She is young, brittle and tender.
I:8935;77;Cagney won the New York Critics Award in 1938 for this great performance and he dominates the film.
I:8935;78;His death scene is sensational.
I:8935;79;michael Curtiz directs the film with his usual versatility balancing all the elements of action, drama and sentiment with great skill and racing from one scene to the next without pause for breath.
I:8935;80;There are some excellent sets and the lighting is particularly impressive, as preserved in the excellent print.
I:8935;81;Curtiz was a master crafstman.
I:8935;82;There is a worthwhile featurette on the film and its stars and a very verbose commentary.
I:8935;83;A technicolour musical short is on hand too with a good parody of Michael Curtiz, some pleasant dance routines and glimpses of the sets of the technicolour productions from Warner's 1938 films, including """"The Adventures of Robin Hood""""."""
84;Ann Sheridan, while not being on the screen near enough, is beautiful.
85;I've always found her to be one of the hottest women of the Golden Age.
86;We enjoy all things Art Deco and vintage, particularly 20.40's.
87;We realized that we were really enjoying the movie!
88;both Jimmy and Pat O'Brien give superb performances, in that they manage to make the characters believable and sympathetic.
89;that Pat O'Brien, with his delightfully deadpan earnestness, manages to make this seem both logical and possible is a tribute to the best acting of the gangster genre.
90;the reform movement in this film operates on two levels.
91;menacing, are classic comic relief.
92;again, a tribute to the fine acting involved.
93;The ending is intensely powerful, and somehow manages to be so through multiple viewings, with James Cagney so capturing the ambiguity and pathos.
94;and perhaps realisation that this is the most anyone can hope for is what makes a tragic ending seem a resolution.

100;This is an excellent movie, with numerous big name stars.
101;Cagney and O'brien are outstanding and, surprised, by a minor role for Bogey.
102;this is a timeless movie and worthy of your time to watch.
103;Cagney is riveting as Rocky.
104;Angels with Dirty Faces is a great movie, a true classic that combines an excellent crime movie with the characters like crooked lawyer (Humphrey Bogard) and corrupt politician (George Bancroft) with whom Rocky formed a doomed business alliance and a very human and compelling drama of two best friends, the choices they made, the roads they took and where the roads brought them.
105;Great directing, writing, acting from everyone and absolutely brilliant performance from James Cagney.4.5/5

111;Thanks for selling a great product!!!!!!!!!
112;When I was a young boy I happened to see this movie.
113;I have watched the best movies of all eras and to tell you the truth this movie is thew one that stands out.
114;I can guarantee if any kid watches this movie today even with all those blockbuster movies out there, he or she will be touched as much as I have been with this movie 20 years later.
115;I recommend this movie to all families who want to watch a great classic movie without the blockbuster innuendoes.
116;Three friends will be carried for those strange twists of fate in a priest a good man and a criminal.
117;curtiz established as a young promise in 1938 with this famous work .
118;cagney and Bogart are terrific.
119;This is the COLORIZED version of the Cagney classic.
120;If you'd like to see one of the great gangster movies of all time .
121;including Rocky Sullivan's intense march to the electric chair .
122;in beautiful baby blues and pretty pinks, knock yourself out.
123;Of all the Cagney films I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them, this is the way that I always remember him.
124;He's tough talking, swaggering, with the hint of a good guy that never got a break and was destined for a life of crime.
125;Cagney is amazing in this role, and you'll recognize so many of the mannerisms and speech patterns that became his trademark and part of his legend.
126;Pat O'Brien also makes a good impression in his role as Father Connelly, and this type of role is what he is well remembered for, too.
127;The movie is fast, full of memorable moments, and the last scenes will stay with you for a long time.
128;This is one of those they don't make them like that anymore movies, and it's a must.
129;Rocky whose cynical outlook on life has been softened by his romance with true.
130;One of the best gangster movies ever made.

132;Cagney is the quintessential gangster with a heart of gold, and his real.

134;Beautifully realized in every respect.
135;James Cagney shines as gangster Rocky Sullivan in his greatest performance.
136;Great supporting cast includes Pat O'brien and Humphrey Bogart.
137;This is a must for any gangster movie fan.
138;As a matter of fact this is a great movie for everybody.
139;Well, we come to find that Rocky's not quite so bad, that he really cares and has a heart of gold.
140;The way Sullivan 'takes care of' those who screwed him over is played to perfection by Cagney.
141;"I'm honestly shocked it has attained ""classic status"" I also didn't like the ending, and here's why: It very well could have been poignant, a tough."
142;guy sacrificing his dignity for the good of the youth, but it is done so heavy.
143;In my opinion it is the best gangster film to come out of this era that I have seen so far.
144;Though it's a gangster movie, it is so clean and people can learn a lot of good lessons.
145;We enjoyed watching it as family.
146;James Cagney is a great actor.
147;Cagney is the charming gangster Rocky who returns after 3 years in prison to challenge other gangsters and political figures who may have put him there.
148;Rocky is a charismatic figure which enthralls the neighborhood.
149;The finale is very moving and turns the tables on the struggle of course with Rocky in full control.
150;The fabulous James Cagney was never better, as his portrayal of Rocky Sullivan has great depth.
151;Surprisingly, the films holds up well, as the problem with youths worshipping the criminal element is just as prevalent today as it was when the film was made.
152;Strong performances, gripping drama and humor make this a perfectly.
153;In my opinion, Cagney's final scene is his finest on film (and you don't even see him for half of it!)
154;Do yourself a favor and see Cagney at his best, and enjoy the greatest gangster movie of them all.
155;It is a penetrating insight into a number of well.
156;Director Michael Curtiz portrays a bulls.
157;James Cagney, who plays Sullivan with the bravura performance of a long and distinguished career, absolutely dominates each scene with his tongue and flashing arms.
158;Sullivan is a recently released convict from Brooklyn who returns to the scene of his youth and finds that the local youth gangs have elevated him to heroic stature.
159;Yet, despite his criminal life, there is much good within him.
160;Now he walks the streets, attempting to have it all, money, a good.
161;looking dame (sweetly played by Ann Sheridan), and the respect of his peers, even if those peers are the Dead End Kids.
162;And Father Jerry (O'Brien) tells Sullivan up front that he will go after him using the power of the media.
163;ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES is a character drama that uses crime and hero worship as a backdrop against which a flavor of a decade is portrayed.
164;A surprise ending that really is a surprise is the capper.
165;This is one of those timeless classics that stand the test of time.
166;One of the greatest and most memorable films of all time.
167;This has been a favorite of mine for many years.
168;The result of a dumb idea with one of the boys getting caught by the police and the other turning to the church is both exciting, sad and ultimately inspiring.
169;cagney and O'Brien are simply brilliant here and this film made me a big fan of both of them.
170;Bogart is also in top form as a shady lawyer and the Dead End Kids are always a treat.
171;Much more than a gangster film with one of the most memorable and moving endings of all time.
172;This release does have some good extra material such as two commentaries, a feature.
173;ette, trailer and some other cool goodies from the era.
174;This is also available in a Gangsters box set(well worth it!)
175;In a sort of Father Flannigan twist, Jerry desires to have a positive impact on the lives of children who, like his former self, are on the fast track to nowhere.
176;Ann Sheridan surfaces thrillingly and to great effect as Rocky's wickedly playful girl Friday, Laury Ferguson.
177;Director, Curtiz is in top form with this meshing of the light and the terrorized, inserting a winning combination of action and comedy that is engaging throughout.
178;This film comes highly recommended for content.
179;The video presentation is better than average but far from perfect.

197;James Cagney is at his best in this movie, He is unequaled as a gangster, and his portrayal of Rocky Sullivan is so believable.

199;this is one of James Caney's ageless and best movies.
200;Good old fashioned good vs bad movie with three wonderful actors that made it a great movie.
201;I'll keep looking for more like this.
202;The interesting commentary's by Dana Polan and there's a terrific audio bonus of the original radio broadcast starring Cagney and O'Brien.
203;"Michael Curtiz' ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" is one of those movies (like his ""Casablanca"" and ""Mildred Pierce"") in which the planets and stars were perfectly aligned."

209;Realizing James Cagney was the best of his Generation.
210;The scene of seeing Gagney coming into the church and hearing the Choir singing is memorable.
211;this film will go down in Film History as one of the best of it's kind.
212;I am so happy to have bought this movie it is one of my favorite movies.
213;I love that I can find movies easier online than in the stores.
214;He agreed to take the fall for them at the advice of his lawyer (Humphrey Bogart) at the promise that he'd jump right back in with them when he got out.
215;In the meantime, upon returning home, Rocky meets up with some childhood friends including the preacher and a girl he used to pick on (Ann Sheridan).
216;this film is incredibly powerful because it comments on so many modern issues.
217;Also, the relationships between the characters are great because they're so well established.
218;Cagney is perfect in the role, a street.

220;this is an excellent film that transcends the gangster genre.
221;"it's a good title and a better picture
I:8935;222;Cagney returned to the Gangster arena with this one, and he delighted everyone as hard.
I:8935;223;To watch Cagney in this role is sheer bliss, because he conveys his feelings by doing everything physically in his playing: i. e. .
I:8935;224;The cast here is top.
I:8935;225;notch"
226;what the viewer experiences here is genuinely timeless!
227;James Cagney knew a terrific part when he saw one, with the role of Rocky Sullivan made to order.
228;an energetic, expressionist fusion of Warner Bros. rowdiness and MGM moralism.
229;Stylistically, the film matches the rhythms and emotions of Cagney's dazzling performance.
230;The harshness of the early gangster dramas has evolved into a slick efficiency.
231;Cagney is on the top of his form, often hitching his shoulders and twirling his head in a fluid, whiplike motion, adding another bit that will be imitated numerous times by many lesser actors.
232;Cagney and O'Brien's walk down the last mile is also one of the most memorable and moving sequences in Hollywood history.
233;"There's a 21 minute making of special, ""Whaddya hear?"
234;that discusses the movie, director Michael Curtiz and the career and friendship of Cagney and O'Brien.
235;The radio play is interesting for a couple of reasons.
236;Film historian Dana Polan deconstructs the movie on the commentary track, setting a record for the use of the word `interesting' and `interestingly' .
237;"preceding every other sentence with ""I found this interesting."""
238;Not only a topnotch gangster picture, but a film with a profound moral message.
239;Humphrey Bogart is outstanding in the role of his adversary, Frazier, a corrupt lawyer and playboy.
240;My husband has always been a big James Cagney fan.
241;Picture is crisp and clear for a very old movie.
242;This is a wonderfully entertaining movie about two friends: a gangster (Cagney) and a priest (O'Brien).
243;This movie is not only a wonderful family movie, it also is especially of value to any Catholic family.
244;He continues to love his gangster friend and cares for him no matter what.
245;The ending of this movie is simply the best I have ever seen: you will be surprised.
246;Angels With Dirty Faces as the quintessential gangster flick, with a stellar cast and the incomparable intensity and gangster chivalry of James Cagney.
247;(Cagney was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.)
248;"But Angels is a more than a gangster flick
I:8935;249;That is what firmly holds this films as classic.
I:8935;250;great gangster films like Angels, Public Enemy and Edward G. Robinson's Little Caesar.
I:8935;251;are important for their historical significance.
I:8935;252;And also, it is evident in the boys themselves .
I:8935;253;There also is a sense that the system itself let Rocky down .
I:8935;254;The vivid richness of the elaborate street scenes, as well as Cagney's gorgeous flaming hair, (which only enhances his already intense and energetic portrayal) are sacrificed in the black and white version.
I:8935;255;Due to a childhood incident growing up in Hell's Kitchen, one kid grew up good with gentle religious influences and the other kid grew up bad in the criminal justice system.
I:8935;256;The execution here feels a bit dated and doesn't hold up as well as many classic Hollywood films, but it still packs a pretty good punch.
I:8935;257;Cagney's love interest is a pluckier screen presence, but is more window dressing than a major part of his character motivations.
I:8935;258;O'Brien plays the priest very well as a virtuous man who feels compassion for everyone in his old neighborhood and wants to to help them.
I:8935;259;Nevertheless, """"Angels"""" is an important milestone in American crime thrillers, and some of the screenplay's double."""
260;crossing is compellingly acted by a solid cast.
261;The mob showdown and conclusion still generate enough excitement to be reasonably entertaining.
262;It's a good movie, not great, but very watchable.
263;The best movie to Worldwide in 1938 and one of the best of all time.
264;Even better than 1938 classic films: The Lady Vanishes (best direction of 1938, New York Critics) The Grand Illusion, Quai des Brumes, You Can't Take It with You (Oscar Best direction of 1938) and many others , and The Godfather and Goodfellas of course,(although I really like these and are favorite of mine).
265;Watch it and enjoy the beauty and depth of this masterpiece.
266;Angels with Dirty Faces is one of the greatest gangster pictures of the 1930's, a decade which saw many great ones.
267;But I very much enjoyed this movie, and I'm only 14!
