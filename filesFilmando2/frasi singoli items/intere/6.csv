1;This is a must see.
2;It is an absolute classic!
3;I was very impressed by the restoration of this movie and the movie its self.
4;It's a very enjoyable movie to watch.
5;That made her want it even more, well what can you do it was a great present for a movie but and I would recommend it to anyone who like old movies with snappy dialog.
6;It is a very clever move.
7;ray's now and this is for sure a have to own!
8;The movie was a new experience.
9;Yes this is worth the upgrade just to see how classic films CAN look at home on your system.
10;I'm feeling good about Blu.
11;"There is a nice coffee table book and lobby cards inside
I:8499;12;Now it's an 'arts and craft' project"
13;off, but the discs are worth it.
14;My favorite moment in Casablanca, and in a sense the moment that really gives meaning to the rest of the movie, is when the activist rouses the people in Rick's cafe to resist the Germans.
15;The activist, the hero, inspires the rest of the crowd to drown the Germans out with a rousing French national anthem.
16;So we see how powerful he is, and why people must make sacrifices on his behalf.
17;It's a pleasure to hear the German song drowned out by an anthem of freedom.
18;Needless to say, Bogie is great in this movie, not just another tough guy.
19;Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head.
20;I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high.
21;conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil.
22;There is a surprise ending.
23;intelligence would soon deal with him.
24;It has unity of time, place, and action.
25;"This makes it a better film than ""Citizen Kane"" and its cynical performers."
26;'Force majeure' trumps a piece of paper.
27;One of the most famous movies of all time, and one of the best, Casablanca is set during WWII, in neutral Morocco.
28;Many famous phrases and scenes abound, this movie is written perfectly, its pacing, plot and humor (yes) should serve as an example to aspiring screenwriters.
29;lasting, and it is an unforgettable lesson on morals and self.
30;Max Steiner's score is great.
31;And most of the world will agree that this movie belongs in the top five films ever made.
32;One I hope they rectify.
33;I've owned this movie for years, but because it was in black and white I never really got around to viewing it.
34;Well I decided to watch it and it was totally delighted.
35;One of the best movies in my collection.
36;Casablanca is a good film but not a masterpiece.
37;The story is bit boring but the love triangle is the best part of the film.
38;Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had incredible chemistry together, they are magic on.
39;One of the best classic movies of all time.
40;This is a movie you can watch again and again.
41;The movie is a classic and one that I have long loved.
42;And every other famous movie line came from Casablanca.
43;I forced my fianc to watch this movie and he loved it
44;ray (viewer take note) with footage of the Warner Brothers' history as trendsetters of the early history of movie making.
45;"Comes complete with a poster and a coaster to impress your friends when you host a ""Casablanca"" party ."
46;It's very easy to write this review.
47;Casablanca is the greatest and the blue.
48;ray disk displays the movie perfectly.
49;Seen it three dozen times.
50;I marvel at how good it is, given the process that went into the writing the script.
51;ray but this edition is so perfectly clear and detailed.
52;Casablanca is my favorite classic film and it never disappoints and this edition blows any other away, including the anniversary edition.
53;"Warner Bros. has done an excellent job in bringing this classic to the ""small screen"" (I have a 62in DLP) in Hi."
54;best of the extras are the Lauren Bacall narrated tribute and the backstory on how the movie was made.
55;The TV version is an example of how to screw up something good (loved the GE steam iron ad, though).
56;I will say this, this was never one of my favorite films when I was younger but over the years it has grown on me and all things considered it IS a great movie.
57;casting and rewites on top of rewrites of the plot.
58;It's amazing the movie was ever made at all.
59;this is considered and regarded by many critics as the greatest movie of all time.
60;casablanca is, however, a legend.
61;i never liked stories of romance.
62;i suppose most men don't, but when i decided to view this one, i was very intrigued and engrossed with the film.
63;it is definitely one the very few love stories i ever developed any respect for.
64;it has the trailer, production notes, an introduction by Lauren Bacall and the excellent documentary on the making of the film hosted by Lauren Bacall.
65;time classics it really is a must have for classic film lovers.
66;Thank you for a great experience.
67;Unquestionably, one of the greatest films of all time.
68;Even after so many years it still impresses me.
69;My copy arrived in perfect condition.
70;This classic film is more than just a love story.
71;it's at once an allegory, morality tale, and propaganda film.
72;It sends the message that the greatest battle we have to fight is with ourselves, and that inevitably.
73;There is something for everyone in this film, which makes it good.
74;but if you know anything about the world at the time this movie was made, it's a truly great work.
75;Take another look through the lenses of the era, and you will understand why it swept the academy awards, won unanimous support of the censors, and the love of a war torn public.
76;Casablanca!The very name conjures up an exotic mix of adventure, intrigue, heroism, selfless sacrifice, and romance.
77;Devoted to her husband and his great cause, Ilsa has been at his side since Laszlo's miraculous escape and sudden reappearance in Paris.
78;the screenplay by Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch is a wonderful mixture of romance, intrigue, drama and comedy (the latter provided both by colorful characters and witty exchanges).
79;Watched it during a Valentine's Day date with my girlfriend.
80;A great couples movie to watch!
81;Tons of good quotes throughout too.
82;It's a must in every sense of the word.
83;Casablanca is often called the greatest if not one of the greatest love stories of all.
84;He has made the best of it though.
85;And soon Rick will find himself caught in the middle of all of this.
86;He now with his wife have found themselves in Casablanca.
87;A love affair had started and soon she tells Rick they must part.
88;Casablanca has proven itself to be a great movie.
89;There seems to be something universal in it's appeal.
90;And plus the screenplay is a knockout.
91;This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
92;It managed to win 3.
93;time classic Hollywood love stories.
94;Also one of the greatest films of the 40's and one of the best American films of all.
95;Watched with friends and they enjoyed it.
96;"This is moviemaking at it's finest, even though no one knew at the time (1944) that ""Casablanca"" was destined for greatness."
97;"top Warner Bros. cartoon, ""Carrotblanca"" is included as well as other features found on an earlier standard."
98;"up as well without changing the mono ""roots"" of the soundtrack."
99;This is absolutely great on blue ray.
100;That are a good amount of extras and commentaries also.
101;Even despite the subtle racism (expected for the times) I love this movie.
102;And the story line is phenomenal.
103;Of all of the movies I have seen this is still in my top five of all time.
104;It is great how many movies have used lines from this one, it just goes to show you that back then they really knew what they were doing and had pure talent.
105;intrigue, suspense and wonderful actors.
106;This is a classic film.
107;Casablanca is a movie filled with top.
108;notch actors and first rate drama.
109;All the cynics out there will think I'm just following the masses, but this movie is truly an American treasure, and I'm glad part of it belongs to me.
110;spend an extra few dollars and pick up the collectors edition.
111;I know, in the immortal words of Victor Laslow, Play the Marseillaise!
112;, a nod from Rick and you have one of the greatest and most moving scenes in cinema history.
113;I've seen it dozens of times, but still feel the emotion well up in me everytime.
114;In Blue Ray clarity it was that much better.
115;It has a good story line that has a beginning, middle and end.
116;Also reflects values: patriotism, honor and unselfishnes.
117;Casablanca is an amazing film.
118;If you have never seen it before, keep something in mind.
119;the performances are insanely good.
120;Bogart really shines in his maudlin moments, mixing self.
121;I have seen this movie countless number of times and I find something new in it each time I view it.
122;It is one of the all time classic.
123;Ingrid is beautiful and humpfrey extremely sharp with his acting.
124;A flash back from the past very enjoyable picture looking forward to more like it!
125;Just acting and a simple scenery and dialogue.
126;One of the greastest films I have ever seen.
127;Will always go down as one of my all time favorites.
128;This is an indispensable part of the education of any 21st century American, as the cultural background this movie affords gives context and meaning to so many quotes: here's looking at you kid of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world.
129;you're right Umgadi, I am impressed
130;This is a classic that everyone should see!
131;Great story and cast, and it's so well known that there are tons of references to it in pop culture.
132;"This movie is a classic for all the right reasons: the right woman ends up with the right man
I:8499;133;This movie still grips you and has the finest performances from an all star cast.
I:8499;134;Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous, the sense of place and time is captured beautifully.
I:8499;135;Interesting movie with all of the repeated references here's looking at you kid in context.
I:8499;136;I had never seen this movie before but always read where its listed among the best movies of all time.
I:8499;137;If you've seen it, you KNOW it's one of the greatest movies of all time (many list it as Number 1).
I:8499;138;If you have a good crisp TV, with three comb filtering, such as a Sony Wega (I have a very good Sanyo), then there will be a much crisper and detailed picture.
I:8499;139;Apart from not being very plausible, Casablanca is worthy of its status as a classic movie.
I:8499;140;She enjoyed this very much.
I:8499;141;Great packaging for a wonderful classic movie.
I:8499;142;I enjoyed watching the movie with my husband for our """"date night"""" at the Century Theater in California and then ordered the movie online through Amazon."""
143;My husband and I watched a showing of this movie in a beautifully restored theater the night he proposed to me.
144;I'll always have a special place in my heart for Casablanca!
145;the greatest, yes, of course.
146;everybody knows 'Casablanca' is the greatest.
147;What it captures, most people do not speak of.
148;Yes dialouge, camera shots, acting, plot, all of the elements that make a great movie a great movie are tangled up inside of this film, but underneath all the Hollywood greatness, there lies a human greatness.
149;A greatness for all the people like Rick Ilsa who had to sacrifice their personal lives for a greater cause.
150;Rick and Ilsa are here to represent these heros.
151;Yes there are the monuments for the soilders and victims of the war, but 'Casablanca' is the ultimate monument to these heros, the everyday people of the world who put their own lives on hold to help the greater cause.
152;A classic old Hollywood romance with stellar, memorable performances from each member of the cast.
153;Every time I watch this movie I'm always surprised with how many lines are routinely quoted in everyday conversations.
154;Just further testament to it's relevance, regardless of the time that passes.
155;Honestly doesn't get much better than this for a perfect movie to curl up with the one you love.
156;generally regarded as one of the best movies of all time, and I'd say with good reason.
157;The love story set against the turmoil of World War II, combined with the larger theme of bringing the US into the war, make this a great movie on many levels.
158;Bogart's performance as Rick is terrific, and Bergman is a perfect foil for him as Ilsa.
159;No matter how many times I watch it, the mixture of powerful performances and a great story keep my interest every time.
160;The only major extra is a documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall, and while it's fine, a movie this good deserves more.
161;Many critics consider this film one of the great ones.
162;I hadn't seen the film in many years, and I had to see it again to make up my own mind.
163;Hey, this is really a good film.
164;The photography is excellent throughout.
165;They can express emotion with the movement of their eyes or the gesture of a hand.
166;They are fun to watch.
167;"arguably (although not from me) the greatest film ever shot, ""Casablanca"" was a timely tale about war."
168;"it is a wonderfully crafted tale of three people bound by both love and cruel fate
I:8499;169;i don't care who you are, there is something in one (and quite likely each) of these characters that you can find that you will relate to.
I:8499;170;even Sasha the bartender stays in your memory.
I:8499;171;this extends to even the secondary characters in the film (the heartfelt plea of the young Bulgarian girl for herself and her husband is TRULY inspired).
I:8499;172;rending love triangles ever commited to posterity are excellence cubed"
173;"the multiple subplots, all engrossing and demanding an investment of your emotion, are woven together masterfully
I:8499;174;The dialogue is witty and simply amazing"
175;there's something here for everyone: you have action, romance, intrigue, suspense, comedy.you name it, it's in here somewhere.
176;and ultimately it all blends seamlessly into a story of true love, courage in the face of all odds, and redemption.
177;"thank heaven that they mastered this excellent transfer in its original format, and didn't butcher it to appeal to the ""widescreen"" audience
I:8499;178;The sound is crisp, from the gentle notes of """"As Time Goes By"""" to the thunderous affirmation of courage from """"La Marseillaise""""."""
179;Most interesting to me was the radio broadcast, featuring the three main stars, and the commentary from the children of Bogie and Bergman.
180;"if you are human, you'll take something with you from ""Casablanca"" that you'll be glad to have."
181;that Bogart guys voice is funny.
182;i can here it right now,PORK Chops and Applesauce
183;Casablanca is generally considered to be on of the greatest films of all time.
184;Admittedly, before i saw it i was expecting to not like it at all but luckily i did enjoy most of it.
185;First and foremost i really appreciated the writing.
186;The dialogue, especially between Rick and captain Renault, was both entertaining and intelligent.
187;I found myself enjoying the political intrigue in the film much more than the romance.
188;i was certainly impressed with this movie.
189;Humphrey Bogart was and still is the definition of cool!
190;I have watched this movie many times over the years, and its always enjoyable.
191;I quite simply love this movie.
192;The acting is great (cast includes, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains) and it has an awesome story line, and to tell the truth, five years ago, I was not interested in movies such as CASABLANCA.
193;In Casablanca, there is a popular nightclub/casino called Rick's Cafe.
194;This movie it TOO good to spoil, so I'll stop there, but please if you get a chance, watch this movie!!!!
195;It was much better than I thought!
196;I'mnot a fan of black and white movies bit thought I would watch a classic love story.,
197;One liners that the young and old can appreciate.
198;Watched it with my 20 something year olds and they enjoyed it.
199;"Here we have an ideal cast following a perfect script
I:8499;200;present enemy heightens their awareness of danger.
I:8499;201;Both my husband and our adult son love Casablanca.
I:8499;202;My husband was happy to receive it as a Christmas gift.
I:8499;203;If you suspend your disbelief, Casablanca is truly one of the best films ever made.
I:8499;204;It succeeds because the most improbable thing that the Bogart character could do was to give the letters of transit to the most beautiful woman of all time and her husband the resistance singer.
I:8499;205;And yet, for a moment at the end, we believe it!
I:8499;206;And this is a tribute to the way the movie was constructed from the very opening shot.
I:8499;207;Woody Allen's Play it Again, Sam, is of course a mild.
I:8499;208;Casablanca is the greatest love story ever told on film.
I:8499;209;ray offers the best viewing experience to watch this classic romantic drama.
I:8499;210;the actors are amazing, the story is emotional, and the film has never looked better!
I:8499;211;This movie combines romance and patriotism in a unique and creative way that is neither corny nor dated in the least.
I:8499;212;To pull off such a feat, an actor with immense skills and presence is needed for the lead, and Bogart delivers big time.
I:8499;213;Watch this today, tomorrow, and the next day.
I:8499;214;She's one of the most beautiful and best actresses ever to grace the screen, to say the least (""""Here's looking at you, kid."""")"""
215;And her foreign accent just added to her charm.
216;fascist and adventure tones and given the fact that the film was released when the World War Two was far from over, it's understood that it captivated viewers back then, as it still does now.
217;"the bottom line: with ""Casablanca"" you get one of the most acclaimed Hollywood movies and two of its most beloved stars in a marvellous coupling."
218;"Yes, ""Casablanca"" may remain a film for ages."
219;I'm still interested in the the color one.
220;I should have seen this movie many years ago as I've heard about it all of my life (I m now 66).
221;I would recommend it to baby boomers and older.
222;I was very happy to have received my delivery so fast.
223;Casablanca digitally remastered with sharp blacks and whites contrasting in the shadowy world of Rick's Cafe.
224;wrenching movie is finally done justice.
225;It's okay because it's a classic and many friends have said how great it is.
226;This movie has everything: suspense, romance, humor, and BOGART of course.
227;this is one of my favorite movie, and a favorite Humphrey Bogart of course.
228;I've seen many times, but will continue re.
229;This movie is a classic.
230;We'll see what she has for a taste.
231;First time watching Casablanca, and I honestly don't know why it took me so long.
232;It's worth watching for at least two reasons:First of all, it is legitimately one of the greatest films ever made.
233;definitely worth your two hours.
234;This is one of the great movies of all times.
235;It's fun to revisit this classic from time to time.
236;I was wary if an old and black and white movie at first, but it was a pleasant surprise.
237;I can see why this movie is so timeless.
238;It's all about letting someone you love go if that's what is best for them.
239;But I did find the historical background interesting.
240;Above the plot and the intrigue, and the great actors and incredible dialogue amd music.
241;Beyond the filmwork and characters, and the tension of war.
242;that alone makes this a great movie.
243;beyond all of that is a love story, and a story about what matters in life.
244;It really is that good.
245;i fully recommend this movie on every level I can.
246;Viewed: 11/02, 11/03, 3/05, 4/06Rate: 104/06: Casablanca is one of the most honored films of all time and ranks one of the top two most romantic films ever made, rivaling with Gone with the Wind.
247;Serious writing, brilliant acting, ravishing cinematography, and unpredictably thrilling story are throughout the picture.
248;Ingrid Bergman has never been more beautiful.
249;Paul Henreid is just a classic.
250;easily the best role of his career.
251;two years have passed by, there will always be Casablanca, and Casablanca will always have a place in my heart.
252;Precisely exquisite and rare, Casablanca is a masterpiece.
253;I do love this movie, I've seen it perhaps 15 times in as many years.
254;I have an enormous screen measuring 14.5' diagonal!
255;the film noire aspect is perfectly captured in high resolution sharp detail (but not excessively so).
256;You can see absolutely everything .
257;the patterns on ties, Ingrid's jewelry and beautiful hair, incredible detail on wardrobe and props, etc.
258;it is so rich in detail.
259;Deep black, crisp white and an excellent transfer curve in between.
260;All the cast look great.
261;They really did an excellent job in transferring this classic film.
262;my home theater screen is huge and this film looks great, as good as anything you would ever see in a cinema.
263;I am not easy to please, and this disc is so well done that this great film is a joy to watch, again and again and again.
264;the dolby digital 2.0 mono audio transfer is excellent as well.
265;One of the greatest movies of all time.
266;Humphrey Bogart is one of my favorite actors.
267;This movie has romance and it has some action scenes with some of the best actors, including Bergman, Claude Rains and others.
268;It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen.
269;I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch.
270;I would recommend this movie to anyone, even my male grandsons.
271;What a great job of acting on all parts.
272;My favorite movie of all times.
273;The movie is a classic and I can pick it up at any time and watch it without getting tired of it.
274;My wife and I are big Casablanca fans.
275;I cannot tell you how detailed and great this film looks.
276;Details that were blurry are now clear and sharp.
277;Ingrid Bergman is absolutely lovely!
278;Classic!Really enjoyed viewing classic with the whole family able to watch the movie .
279;all I can say is good, good, good.
280;Her husband, handled her indiscretion with more calm and understanding.
281;The End as usual brought tears to my eyes.
282;It has great romance, not a happy ending, but an ok ending, great lines, good side characters, with Bogart, Claude, Ingrid and the rest doing their very best.
283;I have watched it many, many times and it always satisfies.
284;I got a Roku at Christmas, hooked it up, clicked on Amazon Prime, and a few minutes later sitting in the midst of the Christmas mess, I watched it again, excellent resolution, the best ever, and I own 2 copies.
285;It's a classic done right with all the humor and romance you could ask for.
286;The film was spectacular and I was hooked.
287;and now I have my own copy to view!
288;After 20 years I still love it.
289;It is so good and so fun on so many levels that it should be with us as long as the technology exists to preserve it.
290;"If ever there was a ""chick flick for guys,"" this is it."
291;In addition to the war and romance, there is also sharp, sly dialogue that still amuses nearly 60 years later.
292;"Throw in some of the best talents of 1940s Hollywood and you've got that marvelous clich , the ""classic."""
293;"If World War II were to somehow disappear from the history books, yet ""Casablanca"" remained behind, an audience could still watch, understand, and appreciate it."
294;loved romantic melodrama is always found on top.
295;ten lists of film lovers the world over, is a masterful tale of two men vying for the same woman's love in a chaotic love triangle.

298;"quoted ""Play it again, Sam""), it is one of the most popular, magical (and flawless) films of all time ."
299;It's a classic that everyone should see it, what more can I say.
300;I bought this movie, thinking it would be a download as other movies I had bought so that I could watch it on a recent trip.
301;"The product came in excellent condition and was shipped out right away
I:8499;302;written note and attached it to the product :).
I:8499;303;The art direction, the love and sacrifice.
I:8499;304;I have watched this movie many times and enjoy it every time I do.
I:8499;305;Great love story and think Humphrey Bogart and IngridBergman did justice to the characters.
I:8499;306;One of my two most faourite films, the other being The Big Sleep.
I:8499;307;but though its great that you have sharpened the print on blu.
I:8499;308;ray and no doubt have many extra features, I still crave for the day when the colourised versions of these films are released.
I:8499;309;But I've seen 'em in colour and I luv 'em in colour.
I:8499;310;great actors, story and production.
I:8499;311;Everyone knows by now this is one of the greatest movies of all time, with more famous lines quoted from it than any other.
I:8499;312;Also, the trademark characters and the usual suspects.
I:8499;313;But I recommend this movie due to the simple love story between Bogart and Bergman.
I:8499;314;When two people love each other, and can't seem to get together, then, find a way to mutally love each other in a new way, well, that is what life's about more often than not.
I:8499;315;I believe this is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8499;316;This is a must see movie.
I:8499;317;And the lines are unforgettable.
I:8499;318;She is crushed, but eventually visits Paris for fresh outlooks on life.
I:8499;319;Ilsa was the victim of false information about her husband's death and creates a love triangle by showing deep affection for both men.
I:8499;320;The three triangle actors are perfect in their roles.
I:8499;321;Isla's Scandinavian beauty and strong accent help to give the movie a foreign feel.
I:8499;322;Victor impresses audiences with his tall, imposing, courageous posture and brilliant lines while Rick's tart, lemony voice clearly brands him as an American.
I:8499;323;The nightclub ambiance is perfect for the movie, being loaded with Nazi officers, resistance sympathizers and slippery deal.
I:8499;324;It has been revered as the best movie of all time by many and ranked #2 on AFI's top 100.
I:8499;325;My advice, watch it once more and appreciate it.
I:8499;326;A great movie must have certain components: (1) great acting, (2) action, (3) humor, (4) a compelling plot, and (5) a memorable song.
I:8499;327;This movie has all five and ranks, in my opinion, as the Best American Movie of the 20th Century.
I:8499;328;Above all, it's a love story.
I:8499;329;If one chucks away, Citizen Kane, then, Casablanca, is probably the best film ever made.
I:8499;330;Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8499;331;Casablanca is one of the few movies that is every bit as good as its hype.
I:8499;332;Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age.
I:8499;333;out of all of the gin joints"""" and """"this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"""" were ever heard before Casablanca's release."""
334;He practically steals the title role away from Rick.
335;His character is incredibly complex and interesting.
336;It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally.
337;Casablanca has been beautifully restored and the extras only enhance the movie experience.
338;Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America.
339;will the Nazi's win their prize?Will Capt. Renault get the young girl?Will Rick get away with Ilsa?This film has become quite a classic.
340;There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film.
341;This movie is absolute perfection.
342;Humphrey Bogart (my favorite actor) and Ingrid Bergman make screen magic in this movie, Claude Rains is also superb.
343;This is THE Hollywood movie, probably the greatest screenplay ever written, filled with memorable dialogue.
344;Easily one of the greatest movies of all time, a MUST SEE.
345;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 10!
346;After hearing about this movie for decades, I finally got a chance to watch it.
347;Humphrey Bogart finds love, loses love, finds love again, and then nobly gives up his love.
348;"If you want to watch a ""classic"" Bogart movie which is actually a good movie, check out African Queen."
349;this arrived brand new, sealed, and perect in super quick time.
350;just incredible writing and acting.
351;It's the perfect timeless classic movie, that you just can't go wrong with.
352;It is a great collector's edition!
353;A film with an unlikely cast which magically came together in this story!
354;The memories of it have lingered with me so that I KNOW it is a classic, by any standards!
355;I was amazed to see how this 1943 Oscar.
356;winning film remains powerful and moving 60 years after its release.
357;the heart of the movie revolves around the conflict created in Rick's heart by World War II.
358;Other songs heard in the film include Knock On Wood, and the unforgettable As Time Goes By.
359;Another crucial element is the snappy and memorable dialog written by the Epstein twins and Hal B. Wallis for this movie:Rick: I came here for the waters.
360;ilsa: (to Sam) Play it.
361;with all these ingredients, director Michael Curtiz and producer Jack Warner came up with a recipe for a movie that became a beloved classic, a status recognized when the Library of Congress named Casablanca as one of the most important American films.
362;Casablanca (1942) is the perfect film, in my opinion.
363;"Everything is in it
I:8499;364;This film also has absolute honesty and absolute dishonesty, and everything in between, from people at the ends of their various ropes.
I:8499;365;Always great to watch a classic!Especially Bogart.
I:8499;366;Highly recommend for anyone who likes Bogart and loves old movies in black and white digitaly refurbished.
I:8499;367;she has Alzheimer's and is really enjoying watching the old classic movies!
I:8499;368;Having said that.you owe it to yourself to see this movie with no car crashes,just really good writing, and brillant acting from all parties.
I:8499;369;it's so much more than a love story.
I:8499;370;As far as I am concerned any movie with Humphrey Bogart is a must see and add in Ingrid Bergman and an all star cast and I was hooked.
I:8499;371;the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
I:8499;372;I have seen Casablanca many, many times and can state without question that this is absolutely worth viewing.
I:8499;373;It is crisp and clean with a depth far surpassing any other edition.
I:8499;374;The beautiful contrasts between light and shadow are visible like never before.
I:8499;375;I thoroughly enjoyed every visual aspect of the film.
I:8499;376;patriotism in its best sense.
I:8499;377;So many great lines from this film.
I:8499;378;Casablanca represents the Hollywood studio system at the summit of its creative powers.
I:8499;379;Michael Curtiz directs an excellent ensemble cast that is dramatic, hilarious and visually stunning (usually in the same scene).
I:8499;380;The acting, the writing and the pacing is excellent and puts the vast majority of Hollywood's output (before and after) to shame.
I:8499;381;It is well designed and visually appealing.
I:8499;382;But, it is worthy, if for nothing else, as a historical footnote.
I:8499;383;If you have an aversion to old movies , don't worry, the fast pacing, clever writing and double entendre's are perfect for more modern sensibilities.
I:8499;384;Enjoyed the journey to Casablanca.
I:8499;385;The Casablanca Ultimate Collector's Edition is something that anyone who enjoys classic cinema must have as a part of their collection.
I:8499;386;Casablanca is a good 'looking' film.
I:8499;387;The writing is good as is the acting.
I:8499;388;Its a classic and serious movie goers will appreciate the well done work.
I:8499;389;And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
I:8499;390;RickAny film buff watching this screen classic today will certainly get a sense of having seen this formula over and over.
I:8499;391;Howard Hawks remade it in a fashion, and actually improved upon it by putting his distinct spin on it, in To Have and Have Not.
I:8499;392;The four strongest performances here, namely Bogart, Rains, Lorre, and Joy Page, who rarely even gets a mention, didn't garner the Academy Award.
I:8499;393;It can be argued that any solid studio director from this period could have made a great film out of the terrific screenplay worked on by many but credited to Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein, and the fine cast assembled.
I:8499;394;Peter Lorre is marvelous as the criminal who worships Rick, and seeks his approval.
I:8499;395;It is perhaps, the most interesting relationship in the film, made more so since Lorre meets his end early on.
I:8499;396;He is the lead figure behind the movement to rid the French of the Third Reich.
I:8499;397;He gives a terrific performance, full of humor and larceny.
I:8499;398;perhaps Bergman was a good second choice for Ilsa after all.
I:8499;399;The viewer knows she's messed Rick up, and wants it to be righted, while at the same time sensing they don't belong together.
I:8499;400;There was a reason, however, and once he knows what it is, he'll come to the same decision the viewer has.
I:8499;401;casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Direction (Michael Curtiz).
I:8499;402;While this isn't the Noir masterpiece many describe it as, it is one amazingly smooth blend of genres which pleases everyone, and makes it one of the great films of all.
I:8499;403;Silent film fans might even catch a glimpse of star Monte Blue as an uncredited American.
I:8499;404;Bogart and Bergman fans can enjoy watching this over and over, as it is one of those films almost universally cherished by movie lovers.
I:8499;405;casablanca is a must own.
I:8499;406;You'll be proud of it.
I:8499;407;The film looks good in its restoration for Blu.
I:8499;408;Not quite perfect, but very good, with better blacks, etc.
I:8499;409;Seeing it again after many years, I was struck by the underlying seriousness of what is essentially a romantic movie.
I:8499;410;Some old films seem slow to contemporary eyes, but this one moves well and is just exceedingly well done.
I:8499;411;The cast is fabulous, of course.
I:8499;412;Casablanca is simply the most enjoyable movie I've ever seen, bar none.
I:8499;413;everything works perfectly in this movie.
I:8499;414;the cynicism, the idealism, the twists and turns toward the conclusion.
I:8499;415;inside best"
416;This is one of the best films and the actors as well as the film are classics and will be viewed as very good for all times.
417;this movie gives so much pleasure it's impossible to resist putting my two cents in.
418;Every character, from the sinister Bogart to the beautiful and confused Ingrid Bergman, from the cynical Claude Rains to the ambitious Sidney Greenstreet, is superb.
419;He's got Nazis to fight, anyway.
420;The movie is a Hollywood classic and one that I'll continue to watch over and over again.
421;Unlike the previous reveiwer, I know this is one of the best movies period, and very enjoyable to all ages.
422;Bogarts performance was one of the best ever on the silver screne, the only draw back I can understand a new viewer is that its a little dated.
423;But, the movie is a timeless classic.
424;"if you think its an age thing Im 25
I:8499;425;What can a person say more than to state that it is best ever movie!
I:8499;426;Also best ever stars ever!
I:8499;427;As everyone says, it is timeless!
I:8499;428;Have always enjoyed this movie.
I:8499;429;It's filled with suspense, good dialog, excellent acting and beautiful scenery.
I:8499;430;Humphrey Bogart, the main character seems to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and it does it very well.
I:8499;431;Then Ingrid Bergman a woman he once loved re.
I:8499;432;enters his life and he has to hold it together in this war time movie.
I:8499;433;What a love story and it still works.
I:8499;434;Classic is always a classic.
I:8499;435;a movie that encompasses it all.
I:8499;436;It's simply the best movie to ever hit the screen.
I:8499;437;the blu ray connect to everything in my house through the wifi system.
I:8499;438;the film itself is of course, wonderful.
I:8499;439;perefct picture all the way.
I:8499;440;who need high tech special effects when you have great writing, score, and actors who know their craft.
I:8499;441;nice to see drama w/o special effects just fine acting.
I:8499;442;Our kids actually paid attention to the plot line and liked it
I:8499;443;It is beyond just a great love story.
I:8499;444;It has murder, intrigue, and it reminds us what it really means to be a man's man.
I:8499;445;Watched it with an open mind set and enjoyed it very much.
I:8499;446;Yes it is an older film, but in its defense they did a wonderful job.
I:8499;447;For back in its day there is still a lot to learn from this.
I:8499;448;There are so many classic scenes and lines that this movie never gets old.
I:8499;449;Bogart and Bergman as well as many great others.
I:8499;450;Simply the best motion picture ever made, it is timeless and I could watch it everyday and never get sick of watching it.
I:8499;451;Casablanca is one of my favorite movies.
I:8499;452;This movie has everything: War, love, murder, gambling, drinking, sniveling French people, brave Norwegians, Nazis, and crooked cops.
I:8499;453;The direction is exellent, and the acting is marvelous, displaying virtually none of the annoyingly stilted style of the time.
I:8499;454;There are so many things working in this scene, but it captures the will of a people to resist tyranny, and also establishes the power of Laszlo to rally people to a cause, which really are the themes of the movie that work behind the love story.
I:8499;455;bogart is excellent, Bergman is radiant, and every other character is much more than a simple role player.
I:8499;456;They all work in concert to create a wonderful, fascinating story.
I:8499;457;simply one of the best movies ever.
I:8499;458;What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).
I:8499;459;At best, """"Casablanca"""" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished."""
460;"People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure."
461;So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.
462;"is ""Casablanca"" a great film?"
463;But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.
464;The movie, of course is as good as ever .
465;amazing forshadowing into the future of the war.
466;I had not seen the movie in well over a decade, and the story seemed fresh and new to me as well.
467;If it's been a while since you've watched it, this is the way to treat yourself.
468;I love the extras too!
469;The picture and sound are really good when you consider that age of the movie.
470;The movie has so many cool lines that are timeless.
471;It's as good the 100th time you see it as it was the first.
472;This tale of love, betrayal, heartache and redemption features some of the most iconic moments in cinema history, the most memorable lines ever spoken on screen and a cast to die for.
473;It belongs in everyone's video library
474;Round up the usual popcorn, and enjoy this classic.
475;One of the greatest, and certainly one of the most quoted, films in cinema history, Casablanca brings all the essential elements to the big screen .
476;adventure, romance, intrigue, suspense, and of course, evil Nazi bad guys (if you doubt this last one as an essential element, then reference the success of the Indiana Jones films).
477;With a director and cast second to none, Casablanca makes a strong case for consideration as the best movie ever made .
478;cementing its status as a must.
479;An important travel hub, Casablanca plays host to innumerable colorful characters with any number of varying agendas.
480;But at Rick's, everyone seems to enjoy themselves.
481;Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the love of his life.
482;She stayed behind to care for him.
483;It is clear that they still love each other.
484;One of the best movies ever made.
485;And this version of it looks great!
486;The depth of the B&W is incredible, every frame is a well composed piece of art.
487;while the performances of Bergman and Bogart are outstanding.
488;Multiple viewings reveal the entertaining characters that make up Rick's Cafe Americain.
489;This is by far my favorite classic movie.
490;What more can you say about this great movie?
491;Bogart is great in this.
492;He's pretty close to perfect on that one.
493;this is a marvelous film, despite the fits and starts of production that are noted in history.
494;the cast (Bogart, Bergman, Henreid) is nothing short of outstanding, with wonderful supporting roles from Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt.
495;ray transfer is good .
496;But for 1942, it's about as good as you can expect.
497;it's well worth the investment.
498;Would Amazon please clarify this!One of the greatest films made, timeless, brilliant, never tire of watching it.
499;If you are a true movie buff, get the collectible set.
500;I can only say that Ingrid Bergman is one of the most beautiful faces ever to grace the silver screen and that talent of hers was unsurpassed!
501;A genuine actress with real talent when Hollywood still had morals.
502;In my opinion, the ending is what makes this movie the all time classic that it is today and unquestionably my favorite.
503;the movie was very hip for its day: a scandaluos beloved woman in desperate times .
504;just thinking about any number of sceens with her and Boggie still brings tears to my eyes.
505;They don't make them like this any more, and no one would go if they did, but this movie is still a gem after all these decades.
506;This is a classic movie!
507;This is certainly worth watching every few years to remind us of life outside us of what e are familiar with.
508;This is on my short list of greatest movies of all time .
509;and it's wonderful to be able to watch it any time I want.
510;time morale booster at a time when America needed it, and these kinds of films were the most commonplace and most wanted kind of entertainment, this particular one turned out to be something very special.
511;yet Bogart pulls it off, and at the same time you can believe him capable of feeling the most intense romantic love possible.
512;Bogie always keeps you guessing.
513;Also, Casablanca is just about the most romantic film ever made.
514;Finally, there are those wonderful supporting players .
515;Movie critics agree that this classic ranks in the top ten movies of all time.
516;Bogart and Bergman have a chemistry that is central to the appeal of this classic.
517;comes back into his life.
518;the movie has it all: Suspence, romance, humor (in spades), and that song!Watch it, just because it's a classic.
519;The acting is top notch (take a special look at Bogart and Claude Rains, very unlike the intricate nuances of a fine Keanu Reeves thespian performance), the direction is superb, the dialog is truly memorable (just notice how many lines from this movie made it to pop culture), and the story is simply unforgettable.
520;This is one of the best movies of all time and if you haven't had the chance to see it, do give it a try.
521;Amazing edition from one of the best film in the history of movies!!!
522;I finally got around to watching this wonderful movie and discovered why it is a classic.
523;even by today's standard, its well acted and a good story.
524;full, and men and women respected each other's values.
525;This movie is a must.
526;see for folks of all ages!
527;The ending has a great moral tune to it.
528;A must see for everyone!
529;A great flick with wonderful acting in all roles!!
530;Seen it a million times and will see it a million more for sure!!
531;Even after 70 years, the greatness of CASABLANCA remains timeless.
532;This captivating classic, so vividly played out and cinematically crafted, is a textbook example of the Hollywood studio system at its absolute best.
533;cASABLANCA is offered both as a Blu.
534;There's also some photographic and printed memorabilia, and a few new documentaries on the making of the film, on its director, Michael Curtiz, another on the history of Warner Bros., and one on its chief mogul, Jack L. Warner.
535;time top favorites, CASABLANCA is a movie I enjoy playing again and again, and if that's true of you, then this upgrade is a must.
536;Who doesn't love a classic and this one is easy to watch.
537;Classic love story and the famous runway scene
538;ups on Bogart's and Bergman's faces are breathtaking.
539;I really liked the ending.
540;This movie is definitely an oldie but goodie.
541;it's a good fix anytime.
542;This is one of my favorite movies and a classic.
543;It is a great story with amazing actors and actresses.
544;A must see for anyone!
545;Worth seeing over and over.
546;I never tire of watching this movie and take delight in all the characters.
547;this is as close to the perfect movie as I've ever seen .
548;My Granny Vi was a massive Claude Rains fan, so she took me to see what became my favorite movie the day after it opened.
549;Even on TV seeing a 16mm print Casablanca is a marvelous movie.
550;It is filled with the quotes fans remember and use in casual conversation.
551;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!
552;Classic love story, set against war back drop.
553;Ingrid Bergman is stunning, and Humphrey Bogart, although not a super handsome guy, fits this role perfectly.
554;A classical is for ever.
555;I bought this video for a good friend.
556;This is her favorite movie of all time and mine too.
557;This is a true classic.
558;A must have for anyone who loves this movie.
559;I was really surprised by the wonderful goodies you get with this box set.
560;I'm not sure of the size but it's actually pretty big, especially compared to the tiny ones that usually come with box sets.
561;The leather case is actually really well made.
562;A bts book that is so nice it can sell on its own.
563;Then there is a special features disc.
564;there was a lot of thought put into this box set for the fans and I am very pleased with it.
565;Maybe a latch to be sure all the content stays in.
566;Everyone in this movie was cast perfectly.
567;The one liners and familiar phrases were so nice to hear again.
568;If you love a great romance with an even better story line see this movie again.
569;I honestly forgot how good it was.
570;Rick is a guy that always does the right thing no matter how much it hurts, I love that about him.
571;And of course Ingrid was so beautiful!
572;To be honest, I was hoping for the same clarity as the rereleased and cleaned up Sunset Blvd , but Casablanca is a much older film, so I will take what I can get.
573;The Bacall on Bogart featurette is cool and neat to see the few outtakes and deleted scenes.
574;This is a fine movie.
575;Humpery Bogard plays excellent role.
576;Every time I watch this.
577;This movie was made by real movie stars with a great story.
578;Great unforgettable lines and characters.
579;The film exists on two levels.
580;one is a love triangle beteeen Rick, Ilsie, and Victor, her husband.
581;although not shown directly, it is important to conclude that she and Rich did have one more passionate encounter when she came to ask for the visas.
582;The two clearly acknowledge their deep love then, and the implication for an adult audience is that they had one last sexual encounter, motivated by their remembered, rediscovered love.
583;"Rick, in part, also tells her that she would later resent his stealing her for himself and her giving up ideals for her ""selfish"" love of Rick (troubles of three little people speech)."
584;ism gets her on the plane, but the two are clearly giving up their one really loving and carnally passionate future with each other.
585;unlike simplistic treatment of love and sexuality in Hollywood films since about 1980, this film displays a complexity of emotions that are refreshingly realistic and adult.
586;As a powerful political film, Ilsie symbolizes innocent and fraigle France, and Rick clearly stands for all of America in the very early 1940s which is, at first, opposed to taking anyone's side but changes when fully aware of the evil of the Nazis.
587;Thus, Rick's evolution and return to his previous freedom.
588;It is an interesting and telling American format that makes palitable, via romance, a political position.
589;Hands down, Casablanca is the best film I have ever seen.
590;handedly formed the genre of the Hollywood romance as we know it today.
591;"But it's not a great movie because it's influential
I:8499;592;at the heart of Casablanca is an amazing set of actors.
I:8499;593;The other actors in the film are just as powerful, playing their roles to perfection.
I:8499;594;Sam is a loyal friend and confidant of Rick's who tries to protect the stubborn barkeep.
I:8499;595;Ilsa is a confused and love.
I:8499;596;Claud Raines, arguably the best actor of the bunch, pitches in an excellent role as Louis, the smarmy captain of the police in Casablanca.
I:8499;597;beyond the terrific performances in the film, the story itself is unique and tense.
I:8499;598;present, accentuated by the masterfully performed music, often a variation of the love song """"As Time Goes By."""""""
599;The directing is top notch as the cameras focus on the desperation and tension in each actor's performance while at the same time breaking that tension with comedy at just the right moments.
600;And of course, the ending is perfectly bittersweet, with Rick having to make the hardest decision and biggest sacrifice of his life.
601;there have been many great films both before and after Casablanca.
602;Casablanca is truly unique, and in my mind is by far the best film of all time.
603;or is it my heart pounding That and all the rest of the memorable dialogue are all intact.
604;A great experience is seeing the film at a revival house.
605;Casablanca is one of those timeless classics that people will watch forever.
606;Outside of perhaps 3 other films this is very likely the most perfect film ever made.
607;The acting and the directing are absolutely inspired.
608;Shot in black and white the cinematography is excellent.
609;The music and the plot twists are themselves spell binding.
610;all in all a landmark film.
611;This classic renders perfectly on my iPad and computer screen.
612;The movie itself is beautiful and a work of art of film noir .
613;This box set is well worth the money !
614;I give this film a four out of five for one reason only as it otherwise is a perfect film.
615;But despite this I loved the film.
616;Loved that it is one of the few old classics available on Amazon Prime.
617;Two amazing actors with an extraordinary supporting cast, the mystique of Casablanca and WWII, and the greatest love story ever.
618;Casablanca is one of the classic movie greats.
619;This is Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their best, and the supporting cast is full of well known actors of the time (Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson).
620;"we have been watching a lot of classic movies with our teens to show them where a lot of the quotes they hear come from, and Casablanca is very rich territory indeed: ""Play it, Sam"", ""Here's looking at you kid"", ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."""
621;", ""Round up the usual suspects"", ""We'll always have Paris""This movie has everything, including great acting, romance, action, good music, and exotic locations."
622;The cinematography is simply amazing and gives the movie a truly grand feel.
623;this is a classic that shouldn't be missed!
624;Very easy to watch on line.
625;Good experience with Amazon Prime
626;I love these two people, especially in this story.
627;ray edition is absolutely terrific, almost unbelievably good.
628;I think bogart was one of the greatest actors ever.
629;This is one of the best movies ever made.
630;Humphrey Bogart is at his best with an all star cast to back him up.
631;This is a timeless classic for all to enjoy.
632;One of the great movies of all time, a classic gem that is as entertaining today as it was in the 1940s.
633;winning direction, excellent dialogue, and outstanding performances highlight this legendary film.
634;All of the leads are solid, with an especially good job by Bogart.
635;But there's compassion somewhere in Rick's heart, and a desire to do the right thing.
636;Part of Rick's mystique is the fact that that question is never answered.
637;Ilsa still loves Rick, yet she's also very devoted to Laszlo.
638;The fine supporting performances include a slick, conniving turn by Peter Lorre and a wry one by Claude Raines as the corrupt (but curiously sympathetic) police chief Reynaud.
639;The character interactions (especially the good rapport between Raines and Bogart) and motivations are convincing and well.
640;"Even the music is wonderful
I:8499;641;Indeed, this film has become indelibly embedded in our popular culture"
642;"Fantastic in every way, nearly perfect
I:8499;643;This film deserves the fine treatment that """"Citizen Kane"""" received."""
644;A classic love story with an appropriate ending.
645;One of the best love stories of the twentieth century.
646;rick has never laid eyes on her since that day when his insides had been kicked out, but here she is again in the company of Victor Lazlo, a freedom fighter considered an enemy of the Nazis.
647;But also for the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman who lights up the screen each time she walks on, or for the brooding Humphrey Bogart as he cries into his bourbon for his torn heart.
648;I enjoyed watching the whole story unfold but just OK for me.
649;Many people do not care for colorized versions of Black and white movies but the colorization of this classic movie is so good that one would swear that it was filmed in Color.
650;Romantic comedy and musicals I can stand (to an extent, as I don't like An American in Paris).
651;But I hate pure romance.
652;i came into the movie thinking it was something like Notorious, romantic suspense or something of that nature.
653;It was pure romance, pure romance.
654;She comes and talks to him.
655;The guy is prominent on the Nazi blacklist and so the Gestapo, who just arrived, want to see to it that he stays in Casablanca.
656;There are some twists and the movie ends.
657;, etc. claude Rains and Peter Lorre are the best actors of the bunch.
658;But the opening to this movie does that constantly.
659;people say this is the best movie that has ever been made.
660;It's a good movie to see what WWII was like (this was made before it was over).
661;it represents everything that was great about movies in the 40's, 50's, and 60's.
662;There's romance, espionage, mystery, and of course, the song.
663;The characters are well developed, flawed (in a very good way), and the story isn't spoon.
664;fed to the viewer like most modern movies.
665;Great to have this classic stored in the cloud ready to access at any time.
666;Excellent combination of story and characters.
667;casting is legendary and after my fourth viewing, the genius of it became clearer still.
668;I can watch it over and over and see something new each time.
669;I was so deeply touched by the character depth, the story line, and the settings.
670;Every aspect of this film, from casting to script to photography to editing, is flawless.
671;Every scene is paced, played, and edited for maximum effect.
672;"A film that shows what the studio factory system could produce when everything came together
I:8499;673;and the parts are delightful.
I:8499;674;If you love this movie as much as me, you'll have to own this incredible film.
I:8499;675;It is rare or impossible to see classic films on the big screen, so we get use to seeing them on television usually cropped, cut and grainy.
I:8499;676;It's all about detail and clarity!
I:8499;677;The bonus features are also worth owning.
I:8499;678;This is a good movie and once you watch it you realize where a lot of the famous saying's come from, such as Here's looking at you kid .
I:8499;679;There's nothing like an old classic to watch a very old but good movie it's a joy to watch.
I:8499;680;Although Casablanca is set during WWII, it is still timeless.
I:8499;681;It is a must see for anyone who enjoys love stories, light action, and intrigue.
I:8499;682;Action.You can feel the passion and pathos oozing from lovers Bogart and Bergman.
I:8499;683;no one delivers glib lines more brilliantly than Claude Rains.
I:8499;684;A definate must see for everyone
I:8499;685;A fitting tribute and platform to showcase this timeless classic.
I:8499;686;It truly is the ultimate platform for this classic.
I:8499;687;I guess most of the enthusiasm for this film comes from old.
I:8499;688;This is a great movie.
I:8499;689;Depending on whose point of view you are watching it's a drama, it's a romance and it's a comedy.
I:8499;690;The entire cast is brilliant.
I:8499;691;Claude Raines makes a great straight man!!!
I:8499;692;My favorite part is where they are singing the French national anthem.
I:8499;693;Powerful and beautifully told story of our inner turmoil between wanting good and serving ourselves at the expense of justice.
I:8499;694;Enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
I:8499;695;Number 2 movie on the all time best movies.
I:8499;696;Casablanca I've found that there's lots of people who love the film and will defend it if need be, which is great because it'd be funny if someone wanted to defend let's say, From Justin to Kelly.
I:8499;697;all is fine until Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund have stopped in the bar.
I:8499;698;Victor is a kind of a hero fighting the Nazis.
I:8499;699;a film I think becomes a classic when it almost seems to transcend it's medium, where it's quoted or referenced.
I:8499;700;Casablanca has quite a few of these with the here's looking at you kid, of all the gin joints., beautiful friendship and play it again Sam becoming well known quotes in cinema history.
I:8499;701;movie is one of the best classics of all time.
I:8499;702;If you enjoy Bogart films, then you will love this, it is the 4th Bogart film I have seen and I truly enjoyed it.
I:8499;703;Bogart and Bergman take the cake.
I:8499;704;I have always been an avid movie fan since childhood (60 years) .
I:8499;705;I love films with a good story, smart dialogue and good pacing.
I:8499;706;This film has all of those qualities.
I:8499;707;It is a must see.
I:8499;708;If you have never see Casablanca you will be amazed at the many contributions this film has made to to the greater body of film works.
I:8499;709;this of course is a great movie.
I:8499;710;i really enjoy the stars in this one.
I:8499;711;i have seen it many times and stilll like it when i see it.
I:8499;712;I love the old classics.
I:8499;713;But this one is one of my all time favorites.
I:8499;714;The actors are great and the love story and, of course, the notable lines keep me coming back to this movie.
I:8499;715;Virtually every scene is classic.
I:8499;716;One of the best movies ever made for that time and era.
I:8499;717;Humphrey bogart is one of my favorite actors.
I:8499;718;A comparison of these two scenes (their structure andplacement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mereentertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art.
I:8499;719;There isnothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically orperformance.
I:8499;720;wise, that can put it in a class with many of the otherhighly praised great films of the past.
I:8499;721;Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group"
722;Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana.
723;What a great classic story of love and war!
724;Humphrey Bogart at his best, and Ingrid Bergman fits her part to perfection.
725;You have to see this movie!
726;The sharpness of the images, the interplay of light and shadow, the radiance of the visuals, the clarity of the sound .
727;This is glorious black and white at its best.
728;And if that isn't enough, there is a second disc of intriguing extras.
729;A true classic treated the way it deserves.
730;This is as good an edition as any.
731;This film is that rarity of a classic that deserves the title.
732;And it's entertaining to boot.
733;the romance between Rick and Ilsa is very believable (and it needs to be or you won't go for the ending).
734;But just as believable is her devotion to freedom.
735;it also contains some of the greatest characters.
736;and the greatest character actors.
737;in this time of increased patriotism, the singing scene in the bar is all the more moving.
738;"if you haven't seen it, do so, if only to increase your film literacy
I:8499;739;I think its because the movie is about the giving of self to someother greater good in the face of love, money and indifference.
I:8499;740;The movie is great and the copy of the film on Blu.
I:8499;741;ray is crisp and clear to watch.
I:8499;742;It's so nice to see these films in all their retouched glory .
I:8499;743;In addition to its fine physical reproduction, it is certainly one of the best films ever made.
I:8499;744;A year or two later, she finally makes it to Casablanca with a man in tow .
I:8499;745;victor love triangle, corrupt Vichy officials, and a healthy dose of humour, and you have a movie that stands the test of time and is more enjoyable each successive viewing.
I:8499;746;the performances, story, etc. are fantastic.
I:8499;747;The ending is a masterful series of twists, but it never cheats and once you've seen it, it is extremely satisfying but not predictable.
I:8499;748;This is especially true of the dialogue .
I:8499;749;The two commentaries are interesting .
I:8499;750;It's good value for the price, even if you only watch the extras once.
I:8499;751;This was a gift and it was well received.
I:8499;752;One of the great Warner Bros. films of the forties .
I:8499;753;possibly the most productive decade in the history of Hollywood .
I:8499;754;ingrid Bergman: """"Play it Sam."""
755;Bogart: You played it for her, you can play it for me .
756;"bogart: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""."
757;the film is worth seeing over and over again just to hear Bogart uttering those unforgettable lines in his inimitable style.
758;And of course to enjoy that celebrated song by Dooley Wilson .
759;Casablanca featured one of those all star casts that only come along once in a lifetime .
760;Casablanca won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Michael Curtiz) and Best Screenplay (Julius and Philip Epstein).
761;It also had nominations for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Score.
762;"Humphrey Bogart didn't receive the award for Best Actor but he was recognised some years later when he won the Best Actor Award for ""The African Queen""."
763;"In my opinion he should also have won for his outstanding portrayal as Fred C. Dobbs in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) and again for ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954)."
764;"There have been many many books written about Humphrey Bogart but I can confidently recommend ""BOGART"" by A. m. Sperber and Eric Lax as being one of the best and a really fascinating read."
765;One of the best pictures ever made.
766;I got partway through, then she asked me to join her party.
767;Despite the interruption, I thought it was a wonderful film.
768;the second time and the third time and every time since, I see it and think, This is so fine.
769;Because there are so many characters and they all have their complex personalities and situations.
770;ingrid Bergman is beautiful as always and wears some pretty interesting outfits.
771;But in my opinion, it is really Claude Rains that steals the show here.
772;"He has all the good lines
I:8499;773;yeah, I know, wake up), but.
I:8499;774;the music is also very good, and to use my mother's words, the groovy globe at the beginning is .
I:8499;775;I like this movie and I think it's one of the best Hollywood ever turned out.
I:8499;776;See it and enjoy Ingrid, Humphrey, Paul, and Claude.
I:8499;777;Classics become classics for a reason: The acting brilliant, the cinematography iconoclastic, and the directing perfect.
I:8499;778;A real 5* movie that will always be a classic!
I:8499;779;Two great stars: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
I:8499;780;I have seen Casablanca numerous times and still watch it every time as though it were the first time.
I:8499;781;Bogart played many good roles as a villain and both shine in this movie as lovers.
I:8499;782;Casablanca was a good movie, a very good one indeed.
I:8499;783;There were true characters in the movie, not people playing themselves, which was very refreshing in the face of today's movie climate.
I:8499;784;there are so many plot points and mini twists and turns in the dialogue and character interaction that this is a movie one has to watch several times to get the full experience.
I:8499;785;ingrid Bergman gives a very good and skillful performance, even better than Bogart.
I:8499;786;But the whole cast is very good, and this is just a classic movie for everyone to see, ecspecially if you think that profanity laden erotic murder makes for the best movie of all time.
I:8499;787;the transfer is super sharp and crisp.
I:8499;788;The Patriot is one where this is true.
I:8499;789;This classic movie has it at all, definitely a film that will still be lauded 50 years from now.
I:8499;790;I recommend it to everyone.
I:8499;791;The product was a gift .
I:8499;792;The person I had the gift sent to was very pleased .
I:8499;793;He called and told me how happy th was with it.
I:8499;794;Classic film continues to be one of the best ever made.
I:8499;795;Bogart and cast are awesome and movie is over before you know it.
I:8499;796;This movie is a true classic from a time when the actors were the movie and movies weren't dependent on a lot of special gimmicks to keep the audience interested.
I:8499;797;Casablanca is perhaps considered one of the best well.
I:8499;798;respected movies of all time.
I:8499;799;Before I even watched the film, I knew that I would love it from start to finish.
I:8499;800;Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart both do an amazing job in this film.
I:8499;801;Also this Academy Award winner for Best Picture clearly deserves a round of applause.
I:8499;802;Perfect film for families, couples, or anyone who wants to enjoy a good movie.
I:8499;803;One of my absolute favorite movies felt fresh and new in such gorgeous high definition.
I:8499;804;This movie is considered one of the greatest ever made.
I:8499;805;This is a story of love, loss, loyalty, redemption, and altruism in a world of selfishness and greed.
I:8499;806;Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast in a stoic role with a moral dilemma, and Ingrid Bergman is one of the most beautiful people to ever be put on screen.
I:8499;807;Casablanca is a definite recommendation to anybody.
I:8499;808;In this movie, an American expatriot who was once a gunrunner, had an intense affair with a mysterious woman, and now runs a highly successful bar in Casablanca, comes into possession of letters of transit.
I:8499;809;From this wildly improbable plot stems quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.
I:8499;810;The pacing is brisk, dialogue performances perfect, cinematography phenomenal.
I:8499;811;"
812;Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
813;The significance of Casablanca, which is in Northern Africa, is that it is a popular place to come to for refugees who are fleeing from the Nazi occupied European countries and will hopefully find political asylum in America.
814;Most of the movie takes place in Rick's Cafe with many memorable lines and scenes.
815;The thing that sets this movie apart from all others is the tremendous ending.
816;It's truly the consummate love story and exemplifies what true love is.
817;The Special Edition version is well worth the extra money compared to the previously released versions.
818;It's been a while since I watched Casablanca and I had forgotten how beautifully crafted it was, and especially how many absolutely classic lines it contains.
819;ray transfer absolutely does it justice.
820;The picture is as perfect as you could ever expect from a movie made 70 years ago.
821;The year, 1942, with the Third Reich at its height in World War II.
822;"themed, multilayered movie of the same name, based on a Murray Burnett play originally titled ""Everybody Comes To Rick's,"" well, is the story of people searching for hope in a hopeless world, with mixes of intrigue, danger, the eternal triangle, the rebirth of one's soul emerging out of the chasm of cynicism, and fighting for a broader cause rather than looking out for number one."
823;The owner, Rick (Richard Blaine), is an American expatriot who is completely neutral about everything, which is an asset for both the Vichy French and the Nazis.
824;"I stick my neck out for nobody he tells Renault, who replies ""A wise foreign policy."""
825;"Alas, there came ""the wild finish."
826;There's the pickpocket, Carl, Rick's waiter and accountant, Sasha, the Russian barkeep, and a Bulgarian couple hoping for their chance at freedom.
827;That brings into mind the flashback seen, with Rick and Ilsa the epitomy of a couple in the throes of romance, and it's quite a shock to see why he's the cynic that he is.
828;all the characters and actors are wonderful, with Bogie at his best, Ingrid Bergman at her loveliest, Claude Rains at his most dapper as Renault, and Sydney Greenstreet pulling in another hammy role as Ferrari.
829;i've seen this many times and enjoyed it more everytime.
830;Maybe the best movie ever made.
831;One of Bogart's best roles.
832;Casablanca: easy to enter, but much harder to leave, reflects the screenplay and performances of this remarkably popular film.
833;Adapted from a play, Everyone Comes to Rick's screenwriters and subsequently Oscar winners, Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein, including Howard Koch, and directed by Michael Curtiz, this small film with a remarkable history remains remembered as one the best films ever made.
834;The production began as America rolled into World War Two.
835;The cast of Humphrey Bogart, Paul Henreid, Claude Raines, Sydney Greenstreet, the always scene.
836;Well it is, and it is for a reason.
837;Casablanca, a sweeping romance set during WWII, is still a fresh movie today.
838;Unlike many old movies , this story transcends its particulars to explore the painful and often wrenching conflict in the human heart between serving oneself and serving the greater good: the quintessential question that defines character.
839;As a tribute to its greatness, this film's relatively simple story has been the object of literally hundreds of derivative plots and references within movie story lines.
840;It is the standard by which cinematic romances, and for that matter, many cinematic dramas, are measured.
841;I'm so glad I got this!!
842;Besides being one of the greatest movies ever, it looks and sounds so amazing on Blu.
843;Glad to finally see this classic.
844;Bogart is the reason this film is a classic.
845;I was certainly impressed by the clarity and sharpness of the streamed version of this classic film.
846;The film of course is considered almost perfect, and I wouldn't presume to sit in judgment of it.
847;This stream from Amazon to our smart TV was beautiful.
848;The sound was vibrant and the picture crystal clear.
849;I was really Wowed by it.
850;The first time I saw this movie in college I knew it would be the start of a beautiful friendship!
851;bergman film that had moved me so.
852;I'm just catching up with cultural slice of Americana.
853;There's a reason why CASABLANCA routinely appears in the top ten on lists of the greatest films ever made.
854;bogey is superb in his wit and cynicism.
855;In a day when a woman's beauty had to be portrayed by means other than having her remove her clothes, Bergman comes across as irresistible, compelling, a woman worthy of waiting at a train station when everyone except you knows she won't show.
856;It is one of the film's ironic and pivotal lies, for in fact he does.
857;the casting, as many reviewers have observed, is arguably perfect.
858;There is not a slow movement in this film, remarkable in a motion picture with very little of what we would today call 'action'.
859;cASABLANCA is one for the ages.
860;It's astonishing, as the good woman might have said, how it lasts.
861;Casablanca is a great movie classic for many audiences to enjoy.
862;It deservingly won three Oscars in 1943, including Best Picture.
863;This was filmed and written beautifully.
864;This highly original plot has influenced many movies filmed after this, and it remains ahead of its time.
865;Despite its war theme, it digs deep into the romance and jelously elements.
866;Many twists and turns arise, always keeping audiences interested.
867;The acting from all the performers is marvelous.
868;Bogart, previously known as the rough guy, wonderfully transforms himself into a more sensative guy for his Oscar nominated role.
869;Bergman beautifully portrays her sense of danger and love in one of her best roles in her career.
870;All other actors, major or minor, also perform wonderfully.
871;Casablanca proves that it will remain a classic for many more years.
872;It is sure to please audience of all kinds.
873;The only thing debatable about this flick is it's placement in the pantheon of the greatest flicks of all.
874;He is placed in the position of choosing between doing what is best for himself or for the world at large.
875;I think everybody knows his decision since this film features the most famous good.
876;After all these years, this film remains fresh.
877;The dialogue crackles and the cast is possibly the best ever assembled.
878;Rightly regarded as one of the best American films.
879;Ingrid Bergman is stunning, absolutely gorgeous, even her voice is sexy, and Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, all playing classic characters.
880;gallic viewer will get a lump in their throat when the French national anthem drowns at Deutchland Uber Alles.
881;Try to count how many scenes in this film have become American cultural icons, imitated and parodied now for nearly 60 years.
882;ray edition of this movie and watching it on my blu.
883;humphrey Bogart,Ingrid Bergman,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre.
884;anything with Lorre in is good to me.
885;its gone now pity I really would of loved to see it on the big screen.
886;Best love story on film wrapped in a nice propaganda piece.
887;Lots of memorable lines, good music, handsome men, pretty ladies, what is not to like?
888;This may be the most perfect movie ever.
889;in addition to Bogart and Bergman, Claude Rains is great as the policeman.
890;He brings several moments of levity to the film.
891;"It should be noted that the line ""Play it again, Sam"" never was actually spoken by a character in the film."
892;Easily on my short list of the best movies I have ever seen.
893;lover high as the ususal suspects acted out the well.
894;My best all time movie.
895;I like watching each year.
896;'Casablanca' is the greatest movie ever filmed.
897;What it DOES have is spectacular acting, a great story, and an astoundingly good script .
898;all the more incredible considering this is one film of hundreds that Hollywood churned out in the wartime and post.
899;Superb plot, script, characters and many classical lines.
900;Well, worth the time to watch the events unfold and a surprising ending leaving you wondering why there was never a sequel!
901;This is the original movie in black and white.
902;this is the definitive classic.
903;The actors are two of the best that America ever produced.
904;What eles can I say about a film rated no. 2 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies of all time, and rates about a ten out of five stars.
905;I still experience that gee.
906;whiz feeling when I see the best of these restorations, and this is without question one of the best.
907;The black and white is so clean and so crisp that it's possible to appreciate the line and shadow and pattern to a degree that could not be done before, unless one had the good fortune to see it sixty years ago.
908;"while the outtakes and deleted scenes are pretty esoteric (film scraps really rather than anything of genuine interest
I:8499;909;Having Bacall around is a plus, and a rarity.
I:8499;910;a great movie and a great restoration.
I:8499;911;I have always loved this movie.
I:8499;912;every line spoken is so wonderful.
I:8499;913;watches movies, but I watch this one at least once a year sometimes more.
I:8499;914;Even though in black and white, this is still a great movie with excellent actors, unfortunately no longer living.
I:8499;915;The drama is exciting, the plot excellent, and the characterization wonderful.
I:8499;916;The film was as sharp as if it had been made yesterday.
I:8499;917;and with the extras provided at the end it was superb.
I:8499;918;I think Paul Henreid is as wonderful as everyone else in Casablanca .
I:8499;919;He is noble and urbane, and a necessary contrast to Bogart's deeply conflicted character.
I:8499;920;The business about reading off a cue card undermines the reasoning for selection as one of the best films of all time.
I:8499;921;(Rather, I have always found Bogart to be a great presence, but not an actor of significant range, and Casablanca stretches him just beyond his limits.)
I:8499;922;To say that Henreid and Bergman have no chemistry is to call into question the strength of the triangle, which I find to be very solid.
I:8499;923;Henreid's stoic persona is expressed with great subtlety and finesse, and is a benchmark for screen elegance.
I:8499;924;A film for all time!
I:8499;925;Its got Bogey, a hot girlfriend and Nazi's trying to make their day.
I:8499;926;Plus you got some great music and wonderful lines like """"I stick my neck out for no man!"""""""
927;there were some powerful scenes, like when the opposing groups sang their respective nationalist songs and the ending was beautiful.
928;There are few movies that compare to this!
929;I have loved this movie since I first saw it, as a kid.
930;Now that I own it I watch it a couple times a year.
931;If you are old enough to remember WWII, this movie is a must.
932;The allure of black and white movies are undeniable for those of us who really like good movies with a good cast and a fantastic theme.
933;It was great the first time I saw this one and it was just as good as it was then, so I will be on the look outfor more of the old movies.
934;It's Bogart and Bergman for Christ sakes!
935;I was very pleased with the movies I ordered.
936;Top notch service and I certainly would recommend this vendor.
937;"It's easy to understand why so many people love this movie
I:8499;938;he has loved this woman for years.
I:8499;939;He continues to love her even though, in Paris, she stood him up without explanation when they were planning to run off together.
I:8499;940;Years later when she walks into his bar, he still loves her.
I:8499;941;Even after he finds out that she had been married before but failed to mention said fact throughout their affair in Paris, he still loves her.
I:8499;942;He loves her as she sit's idly by and let's the men in her life make her moral decisions for her.
I:8499;943;I love old classic movies as much for the clothing as I do for the plots.
I:8499;944;This is one of my favorites because it has both.
I:8499;945;If you've never seen it before, watch it twice.
I:8499;946;The way that the plot entices you to want both Bogart and Rains to get the girl is brilliant.
I:8499;947;one of the best of all time!
I:8499;948;I have a great grandfather who was a Russian Orthodox Jew.
I:8499;949;Bergman and Bogart in their prime with great supporting actors, Paul Henreid, Claude RainsPeter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet add up to a wonderful cast.
I:8499;950;I have seen it before at least a half dozen times and it is still very entertaining.
I:8499;951;This movie was cast well, full of history, romance, and mystery.
I:8499;952;The beautiful Ingrid Bergman shows up at Rick's Night Club, and is a welcome sight to all audiences.
I:8499;953;It's a favorite of Old movie Buffs , while younger audiences are continually attracted to it.
I:8499;954;These are just of few reasons why it is one of my favorites.
I:8499;955;This movie deserves to be the classic that it is.
I:8499;956;I think it's America's favorite movie still.
I:8499;957;The refurbished Casablanca is better than ever.
I:8499;958;The book is really informative, the table coasters a nice touch.
I:8499;959;The total package is very nice.
I:8499;960;Bogart, Bergman, all the great cast of actors were superb.
I:8499;961;It's such joy to see this great movie again.
I:8499;962;The writing is phenomenal and so are, of course, the stars.
I:8499;963;it's timeless and will always remain one of the best Hollywood movies.
I:8499;964;i really enjoyed the documentaries on disk two .
I:8499;965;that was a very revealing and interesting addition to the movie !
I:8499;966;We christened our new Roku device (which is the best way we have found to access Amazon Prime streaming video on the TV rather than computer or tablet) with a family viewing of Casablanca.
I:8499;967;Classic movie with a great cast.
I:8499;968;One of the top 100 U. s. films of the 20th century.
I:8499;969;Loved this movie and very interesting.
I:8499;970;The movie always keeps you on your feet and its very romantic.
I:8499;971;Love the piano players music!
I:8499;972;This film is a classic among classics.
I:8499;973;Every single line of dialogue is quote worthy.
I:8499;974;It's the best screen play ever written.
I:8499;975;i think this is the most overrated film in history.
I:8499;976;They will find something and like it.
I:8499;977;And that guarantees its commercial success.
I:8499;978;But face it: its a love story like everyone else.
I:8499;979;the """"foreign movie"""" category at academy award proves it."""
980;"It goes like saying ""we are the best, but you can apply to that consolation prize""."
981;Sorry for being cruel, but have in mind that there are better movies and directors in this world.
982;I`m not saying american movies are bad: you have the great Woody allen, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick.
983;I bought this as part of my sisters christmas present.
984;"This is almost always on the list of ""best films of all time"", and I won't say anything to contradict that."
985;Even if you don't especially like this film for one reason or another, it is a must see.
986;All in all, this is a must see film.
987;That said, in my humble opinion TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was a better Bogart movie, and it is also a classic, but CASABLANCA is right up there with the best of them!
988;There are a lot of contenders .
989;noir classic, with its snappy dialog, gauzy black.
990;white cinematography and delicious acting.
991;Plus, it's a great propaganda flick and historical timepiece.
992;This is perfect for any movie enthusiast!
993;It comes with so many extras and you can't really beat the deal!
994;The credit should surely go the Epstein brothers, whose incomparably witty script included some of the greatest lines in English language cinema.
995;Their stock in trade was classic chutzpah, and it is amazing how much of their dialogue has entered the popular vocabulary.
996;I used to watch old films so it wasn't bad, but this film is great.
997;Just the acting was great as well as the composer Max Steiner is amazing.
998;I would highly recommend especially if you are into older movies.
999;it is a perfect film.
1000;The print is beautiful and this should be used as a demo of blu.
1001;it'll sell a lot of blu.
1002;"The extras are kinda fun, especially ""Carrotblanca"" with Tweety Bird as Peter Lorre!"
1003;This is a classic movie and I cannot imagine not owning it.
1004;It is still is good old B/W.
1005;the sound is very clean.
1006;Watch it once or twice a year and never gets old.
1007;So predictable but hey,,, it's a beloved classic with classic stars and lines, right?
1008;"One could say that ""Casablanca at its core is about love and romance"", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair."
1009;"one could say that ""Casablanca at its core is about love and romance"", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair."
1010;"But the core theme of Casablanca is much more than about an great romantic interlude
I:8499;1011;Everyone should see this movie, not because it is required but because it is an entertaining movie that has timeless themes of love and nobility.
I:8499;1012;A Classic worth watching moving.
I:8499;1013;It was my first time watching it and I really like it!
I:8499;1014;Yes, Casablance is that good a movie.
I:8499;1015;Bogart's stunning portrayal of a bitter, cynical man with a broken heart should have won him an Oscar.
I:8499;1016;to me, the mark of a memorable movie is if there are memorable, quotable lines and here, Casablanca leads the league.
I:8499;1017;Actually, he said, """"You played it for her you can play it for me."""
1018;Experts say this is probably the most popular movie in the world, an opinion I share.
1019;find someone you love, cuddle on the sofa and let time go by.
1020;proof that there is a higher power can be traced to the fact that B. movie icon, Ronald Ray.
1021;The world ows a debt of gratitude to the best decision that man ever made !
1022;Over the years I have seen bits and pieces of this film and now I am the proud owner and am sure I will watch it again and again.
1023;I highly recommend, if you have not seen it, to watch this great classic.
1024;All the others were and are fine.
1025;Already one of my favorite films.
1026;One of the most romantic and charming movies ever made.
1027;This film is an all time classic.
1028;This movie is the best movie ever made.
1029;Funny, hip, mystery, romantic, action, it has it all.
1030;Bogie is the star, but don't take your eyes off of Claude Raines, he's genius in this film.
1031;The classic movie in high def.
1032;A classic, one of the best films ever made.
1033;The film reflected the world's political state in 1941 despite many of the obvious flaws in the context of the story.
1034;A world where good was Good and evil, Evil, Casablanca takes us to the heart of the human experience.
1035;A gentle, yet correctly seedy glimpse of war and romance at The crucial turning point of the 20th Century, it is the only film I have ever seen four times and shall probably see another four times.
1036;Bergman (and Bogart) tug at your heart strings in the primal choice between passion and duty, the self and society.
1037;A truly great, romantic film, and the music is unforgettable.
1038;A classic love story with a real ending, not a fairy tale ending.
1039;Casablanca is my all time favorite movie.
1040;I love the song As Time Goes by .
1041;I prefer the Good Ole Days .
1042;"Results are clear, concise video and audio
I:8499;1043;I love Casablanca and is one of my all.
I:8499;1044;While many may label it as a romantic film, I think is something much more than that.
I:8499;1045;Aside from the great performances of Bogart, Bergman, Henried, Reins and all the others, the film has a certain appeal that does not feel dated and makes you want to see it again and again.
I:8499;1046;it's one of those films that must be in any collection because it belongs to that rare class of films that can be called Masterpieces.
I:8499;1047;It was a bargain for a great film.
I:8499;1048;The picture is crisp, clear and perfect.
I:8499;1049;The audio is crisp without background noises.
I:8499;1050;The extras are excellent with audiocomentaries, documentaries, and more.
I:8499;1051;if you don't own Casablanca yet, right now is the best time.
I:8499;1052;This 2009 edition is perfect and really cheap.
I:8499;1053;My husband and I love this movie and have it on vhs.
I:8499;1054;Great movie at a great price.
I:8499;1055;One of the best films ever made!!!!!
I:8499;1056;Best move made and some of Bogart's best work.
I:8499;1057;It's wonderful love story, a mystery, and a war movie.
I:8499;1058;I once had a filmophile friend explain to me that Casablanca is actually a 'gay' love story .
I:8499;1059;I saw this as a younger me, and it makes so much more sense now that I am older !
I:8499;1060;This is where a lot of things we see today in movies came from.
I:8499;1061;Had seen bits and clips and finally watched the movie, was really great.
I:8499;1062;I loved this movie and have seen at least a dozen times in the past 30 years.
I:8499;1063;Acting, direction, props, costumes and some of the best screen play writing ever made make this the best movie of all time.
I:8499;1064;This is another classic of the era.
I:8499;1065;So it is a good historical based movie.
I:8499;1066;Mr. Bogart is at his best in this movie.
I:8499;1067;One of the greatest films comes to Blu Ray.
I:8499;1068;The audio transfer is crisp and clean as well.
I:8499;1069;I've had the luxury of seeing a restored print shown in Hollywood, but never thought I'd see that clarity again.
I:8499;1070;for a change they got it right!Extras are terrific and the packaging, while being a little cumbersome, is fun.
I:8499;1071;So much so that I bought it for a friend as a X. mas gift!!
I:8499;1072;For those who haven't seen it, see it.
I:8499;1073;This is one of the most perfect films ever made.
I:8499;1074;Brilliant acting, editing, camerawork, music, lighting, and an awesome script loaded with some of the greatest lines ever captured on film.
I:8499;1075;Helping his lover and her husband escape a Nazi infested Casablanca, keeps Bogie juggling relationships with the French Prefect (Reins) as well as his love interest (Bergman).
I:8499;1076;Great is perhaps an understatement.
I:8499;1077;is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic """"Casablanca""""."""
1078;"romantic lines, ""A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh."""
1079;Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic, intriguing anti.
1080;In many ways he is better than James Bond.
1081;Rick is a hard man with a heart of pure 24 karat gold.
1082;It is better known as the Gestapo.
1083;The story set against a Europe ablaze with the fiery flames of a terrible war, is of the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.
1084;Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant and ethearel beauty is absolutely mesmerizing.
1085;"Rick's fat waiter comes along and gives Renault some money which he won at the gambling tables and says, ""Your winnings, Sir""."
1086;I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it.
1087;It inspires me every time.
1088;Another amusing thing is that many of the characters are named after cars, for example Ferrari and Renault.
1089;One intriguing question you must ask yourself is whether Rick committed adultery by making mad, passionate love to Ilsa the whole night long when she desperately tried all means to get the letters of transit for her husband.
1090;The Director never spells it out but leaves it to your imagination.
1091;"Rick then walks off into the sunrise cooly with his good friend, Louis, saying those immortal lines, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
1092;"is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic ""Casablanca""."
1093;"romantic lines, ""A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh."""
1094;Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic anti.
1095;It is the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.
1096;Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant beauty is absolutely mesmerizing.
1097;I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it.
1098;Another amusing thing is that many of the characters are named after cars, for example Bugatti and Renault.
1099;One intriguing question you must ask yourself is whether Rick committed adultery by making mad, passionate love to Ilsa when she desperately tried all meansto get the letters of transit for her husband.
1100;"Instead he recues them from the Germans and then walks off into the sunrise with his good friend, Louis, saying those immortal lines, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
1101;This is the ultimate classic and I didn't find it till later in life.
1102;Love picking up on all of Bogart's understated moves and Bergman's subtle looks.
1103;She's a beautiful heartbreaker, Rick is broken hearted in Morocco.
1104;Add Nazis, French and refugees and stir.
1105;A perfect film in my opinion that has aged very well.
1106;See it again and if you've not seen it, watch it.
1107;Sure, one has probably seen it many times and, definitely, one probably knows the dialogue by heart, but there is something that keeps you coming back.
1108;Bogart is in top form and the pairing with Ingrid Bergman is first rate.
1109;The story is one that holds the attention and the supporting cast is one of the best, from Peter Lorre's courier to Conrad Veidt as the German major and, in a class by himself, Claude Rains as the politically astute Police Prefect.
1110;All in all, Casablanca is a wonderful viewing experience for our time and for all time.
1111;Casablanca is widely considered the classic romantic movie of all time.
1112;Its themes of love and personal responsibility are timeless.
1113;She finds to her surprise that she still loves Rick and he her.
1114;She abandons herself to his judgement with respect to her future with him and the fate of her husband.
1115;His dilemma is at the heart of this movie's enduring appeal, as Rick must balance love with personal responsibility for a larger fate.
1116;the movie is populated with an excellent and well.
1117;"sketched cast of supporting players: a corrupt French Police Chief with a heart of gold who is Rick's best friend in Casablanca
I:8499;1118;this movie is most highly recommended to anyone with an interest in a truly classic, and entertaining, movie.
I:8499;1119;Casablanca is undoubtedly the greatest film to ever grace the screen.
I:8499;1120;This intriguing story and touching yet star crossed love saga is often masked in the standards it set.
I:8499;1121;The amazing performance by Bogart as a sarcastic yet hopeless romantic is simply spectacular and the entire cast makes up a motley crew of characters that makes Casablanca intriguing at every viewing.
I:8499;1122;Bogart a great actor, and so is Bergman.
I:8499;1123;The only person who knows anything real about Rick is the piano player, Sam (known for the immortal lines Sam, I thought I told you never to play.
I:8499;1124;and Play it again, Sam ) who was present in Paris long ago when Rick's heart was broken.Years ago, Rick fell in love with a beautiful woman named Ilse in Paris, who vanished when the Germans invaded.
I:8499;1125;bogart and Bergman exude excellent chemistry.you can feel their pain and love.
I:8499;1126;The cast is also blessed by wonderful secondary characters, such as Sam, who seems to feel sorry for Rick and Ilse"
1127;The script also gives him many of the wonderful lines: when little rat Ugarte asks, You despise me, don't you?
1128;there's a lot of talking and angst and romance.
1129;the sets are beautiful and harsh, as harsh as Rick sees the world.
1130;The last scene is perhaps one of the most famous in movie history.
1131;Like Audrey Hepburn's Roman Holiday, the realistic and mature approach to difficult situations are what make this story special.
1132;One of the best romances ever filmed.
1133;Because the more often I watch Casablanca, the more exemplary it seems, particularly in terms of an exquisite combination of script, acting, music and cinematography.
1134;Great love story and memorable music.
1135;Great backdrop love story during world war II.
1136;Play it again sam:) Love it.
1137;This is the often quoted movie .
1138;It is a World War ll classic.
1139;I think Casablanca is the greatest movie ever made.
1140;great theme, perfect timing, great acting (Bogart, Bergman Henreid.
1141;"For the Warner Brothers wartime melodrama it was supposed to be, ""Casablanca"" feels so much more significant and multi."
1142;dimensional, a timeless movie that combines political espionage, romantic intrigue and a clever wit against the broader conflict between democracy and totalitarianism.
1143;"It's an unexpectedly powerful scene among so many wonderful moments, certainly enough to inspire Neil Simon to recycle it to comic effect in ""The Cheap Detective"", Peter Bogdanovich to send up another classic scene in ""What's Up, Doc?"""
1144;"and Woody Allen to write ""Play It Again, Sam"" in tribute to the entire movie."
1145;"director Michael Curtiz had a strong track record of success before ""Casablanca"" (consider ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""), but this is clearly his career capper given the perfectly realized mix achieved of script, camerawork, music and cast."
1146;Arthur Edeson's striking cinematography and the legendary Max Steiner's musical score also contribute significantly.
1147;Bogart fully captures Rick's cynicism, sentimental interior and ever.
1148;Bergman is so glowingly beautiful and affecting as Ilsa that there is no question why Rick continues to pine over her.
1149;"playing Sam and sings ""As Time Goes By"" with the perfect sense of nostalgic languor."
1150;disc special edition package contains plenty of extras, some great, others disposable.
1151;minute documentary (produced in 1988) recounting Bogart's career in surprising and often fascinating detail and hosted by a still striking.
1152;hour documentary, also interesting and again narrated off.
1153;the extra disc also includes an abbreviated radio version of the movie from 1943 with the three stars, a fitfully funny Bugs Bunny.
1154;This is a great classic we have watched dozens of times and we will continue to watch it.
1155;Great love story and great lines.
1156;One of the greatest movies ever made.
1157;Romance, suspense, war time drama, a little subtle comedy, beautiful people, and a reasonable price.
1158;Ingrid Bergman was such a fantastic actress.
1159;Bogie and Ingrid both had so much screen charisma.
1160;this is one of the best movies of all time!
1161;This is such an nice old movie.
1162;I loved it, everyone should watch this.
1163;It's great for people who are into old classic movies.
1164;We'll probably watch it more times in the future.
1165;Everything about it works, characters, filming, storyline, even the ending.
1166;Best overall film ever, even after considering Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind or Forest Gump.
1167;I was happy with the ease of ordering online and getting it in time for Christmas.
1168;instead, it was a delightful and full of classic one.
1169;Loved it at first sight!
1170;Coming from the Classic Hollywood film era, this movie fits all the bullet points: a hard.
1171;I enjoy this movie and it is one of my favorites from this film era.
1172;but if you have a little context you will love it.
1173;A love story that will tear at your heart.
1174;love means spending yourself for others' good.
1175;this is really an example of how one should live!
1176;Takes you back to a time that men were men and women were women!
1177;This transfer is absolutely flawless, and does this great American classic justice.
1178;The rich details, great performances, and brilliant sound track will blow you away.
1179;Nothing looks as beautiful and as crisp as classic cinema.
1180;One of the all time great movies.
1181;Normally don't like B&W movies but this is so exceptional I can overlook it.
1182;This classic movie was converted to digital very well.
1183;The picture and sound are very good.
1184;The more you watch .
1185;this movie is just so great!
1186;And it gets better each time you watch it!
1187;65 years after it first it theaters, CASABLANCA remains a perfect film, a timeless masterpiece, and one of the most beloved American cinematic treasures.
1188;Despite , monaural sound, and a square aspect ratio, the clarity is unreal, and it only heightens the enjoyment of one of the greatest films ever made.
1189;There is a terrible paucity of truly great films available in Hi Def right now, regardless of format.
1190;I was introduced to this movie in the greatest gut class in the history of American higher education.
1191;so much of this movie has become classic.
1192;It may be because of the lines, like Here's looking at you kid , or This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
1193;It may be the most stirring affirmation of indominitable strength in a movie ever.
1194;it may be the classic moments.
1195;casablanca is a testimony to love, and hope, and nobility.
1196;Those woeful individuals have never had love, lost love and recaptured it.
1197;is the song that summarizes this classic romantic film of the 1940s.
1198;The film has everything that makes a hit: a handsome leading man, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and a beautiful leading lady, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and exotic locations for filming, Paris and Casablanca.
1199;making her *even* more alluring and desirable .
1200;He is introduced to her husband.
1201;Viktor is engaging in espionage against the Nazis and could be discovered at any time.
1202;Ilsa has an unexpected rendevous with Rick in the middle of the night, trying to extract the necessary documents from Rick .
1203;In order to discover how it ends, to fully appreciate the intrigues, plot developments, wonderful acting, and mystique of the film .
1204;This film is a classic due to the complex story line that unfolds within a love triangle.
1205;It contains mysteries that are gradually revealed, explaining the intertwining emotion of the characters and their behavior.
1206;Another interesting fact is, many of the characters hope is to emigrate to the USA, to start new lives .
1207;This film will remain a classic for all time because so many unique elements come together to create an artistic masterpiece.
1208;It is an old classic and great through Amazon Prime.
1209;Keep up the good work guys!!!
1210;ray version of Casablanca is perfect.
1211;This is a wonderful movie.
1212;It's closed captioned which is great for my husband who is very deaf.
1213;if you're looking at this you probably know how wonderful it is.
1214;By the end, they were thoroughly hooked.)
1215;Seemed to preserve all the classic film noir appearance, only better.
1216;The colors are vivid and video is sharp.
1217;A great gift for Nastalgia.
1218;loved this movie for so many yrs.
1219;This is such a classic movie.
1220;I love it even colorized.
1221;I enjoy watching it over and over again.
1222;This is truly a favorite.
1223;Story excellent along with the acting.
1224;No vulgarity, no nudity, no violence, just plan good acting and a good theme.
1225;these are fairly universal and timeless issues that confront many of us to some degree today as we go about our daily lives.
1226;i enjoyed Casablanca,but i wouldn't say it changed my life.
1227;it's apleasant movie,with a good story,good acting,a good locale and aninteresting cast of characters.
1228;but i realize that's probably due to the fact that the moviewas made almost 60 years ago.
1229;regardless,it's well worth watching,in myopinion.
1230;so it's really all about thecharacters,the story,and the acting.
1231;The acting is first rate.
1232;all grouped together for one of the most eloquent, powerful, stunning and important movies ever made.
1233;Problem is, the revolutionary brings along his wife .
1234;A very well done older film.
1235;I highly recommend to any and all who like film noir, older movies, and fans of films that leave you wanting more.
1236;One of the best movies of all time.
1237;Adventure, romance, intrigue and twists of fate .
1238;It makes you long for a simpler time when it was easy to determine who the enemy was and everyone did the right thing, in spite of their own personal sacrifice.
1239;This is a classic movie that I just cannot but watch it from time to time.
1240;Some of the greatest movie lines of all time come out of this movie.
1241;This movie is absolute perfection.
1242;Humphrey Bogart (my favorite actor) and Ingrid Bergman make screen magic in this movie, Claude Rains is also superb.
1243;This is THE Hollywood movie, probably the greatest screenplay ever written, filled with memorable dialogue.
1244;Easily one of the greatest movies of all time, a MUST SEE.
1245;Winner of the Best Picture Oscar, as well as Best Director and Screenplay.
1246;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 10!
1247;I would have to say this is the best movie of all time.
1248;It is great for ALL generations (hell, i'm only 19).
1249;Classic hollywood movie old Humphrey is still a good watch!
1250;Ingrid and the others make this a must watch for any who haven't seen this!
1251;the star of the show is, of course, the show.
1252;The movie looks amazing at age 61, digitally scrubbed of almost all wear while somehow retaining a fair amount of contrast and original grain.
1253;Max Steiner's versatile music sounds lovely, with plenty of oomph reserved for the dramatic exclamation marks.
1254;roger Ebert's commentary is the loudest track of them of all, appropriate given his enthusiasm level.
1255;He's a terrific guy to watch the film with.
1256;length Bogart docu is outstanding, offering a wealth of clips from the tough guy's obscure early films.
1257;The cast of witnesses is outstanding: John Huston, Richard Brooks, Katharine Hepburn and Bergman all weigh in on their friend's art and legacy.
1258;Henry Mancini covers the vital role music plays in the film, with popular songs of the day providing sly commentary on the action.
1259;Everyone should see this movie.
1260;Casablanca is the 2nd greatest movie of the 100 top in the last 100 years according to the American Film Institute (AFI) poll of 1998.
1261;They had a stable of the greatest stars (Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Lorre, Greenstreet to mention a few) which produced countless movies in short order.
1262;casablanca was the greatest of Warner Brothers (Best Picture Oscar)1940's features.
1263;In my opinion the #1 movie as yet due to the fantasic script, sreenplay (Won an Oscar) plots, cast, direction (Best Director Oscar)and charismatic attraction you'll have in watching this movie over and over.
1264;the extras include a fantastic documentary narrated by Bogarts wife, Lauren Bacall.
1265;seeing is believing, trust me, pull up a comfortable chair and watch this digitalized Black White classic CASABLANCA .
1266;Considered one of the greatest films of all.
1267;loved classic deserves to be here.
1268;It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers.
1269;It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years.
1270;Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that.
1271;This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing.
1272;There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end.
1273;If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch.
1274;Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time.
1275;"Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, ""Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
1276;I have not had the opportunity to watch it yet, but wanted to have it because Casablanca is such a classic movie
1277;Bogart's Rick is the most interesting character as he exhibits a number of traits and transformations that are paralleled in the real world, from his personal loss of a great love to apathy for a higher cause to a metamorphosis resulting in self.
1278;Throw in numerous memorable lines, some fine acting, lots of smoking and drinking that is appropriate for the circumstances rather than overdone, and some hated Nazis, and you have the makings of a timeless, atmospheric film.
1279;This one looks almost perfect in every scene.
1280;and the sounds is vastly improved, too.
1281;It is the early years of World War II.
1282;Casablanca, in what was then French Morocco, is crowded with refugees.
1283;Transit visas that allow departure on the night plane to Lisbon, Portugal, are highly prized and sell at a high price on the black market.
1284;Rick's is a meeting place where people may conduct a little illicit business.
1285;Rick is faces that problem when the real love of his life is committed to another person.
1286;If you are a fan of films from that era, you will recognize other cast members.
1287;The film remains a classic.
1288;As a true classic should be, this movie is so good that you actually look forward to viewing it again and again just so you can be sure you didn't miss anything the last time you viewed it.
1289;The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite.
1290;"Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), he still puts in an excellent performance here."
1291;The best are the As Time Goes By song and the very attractive Ingrid Bergman.
1292;Also the views of Paris are nice.
1293;are among the best and the most humorous in the movie.
1294;and, of course, one of the most brilliant scenes.
1295;I think that one of the secrets of this movie's greatness is that in addition to the outstanding actors, the writers and the director have combined the right mixture of romance, adventure, and patriotism with a huge dollop of humor.
1296;ray version of Casablanca is excellent.
1297;A movie that should be shared with every generation, Casablanca ages like a fine wine and is best when consumed frequently and in large amounts.
1298;Finally was able to enjoy this movie and get all the jokes and puns from the character's quotes from this movie.
1299;This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen, and I highly believe that most people would really enjoy it and remember it forever!!!!
1300;It will always be a favorite.
1301;An absolute must for any film.
1302;an absolute milestone, and one of the most beautifully crafted films in the history of cinema.
1303;Bogart is awesome in this love story and war movie about Morocco and the cafe Rick owns in Casablanca.
1304;Fast pace to keep you guessing.
1305;Top movie of all time.
1306;This is one of hollywoods best and finest.
1307;It begins and ends quite well.
1308;The love between Illsa and Rick is movie magic.
1309;one of the best movies of all time!
1310;Epic is the first word that comes into my mind.
1311;Ingrid Bergman was SO beautiful.
1312;All the characters are unforgettable, especially Bogart's Rick.
1313;Every time I see it I discover something new.
1314;"Stays true to the director's black and white filming, but ""cleans it up"" and makes the images much clearer!"
1315;Hard to imagine a better movie for someone who was alive and aware in 1941.1945.
1316;This movie reinstates that title that he held and still holds today.
1317;Bogart plays Rick, an American living in a French occupied Morocco, who owns a popular cafe and has plenty of connections with numerous people.
1318;She meets up with Rick again in Morocco, evoking memories that Rick had rather forgotten.
1319;Ilsa enlists the help of Rick, who has corrupt ways with Nazis and the Resistance, and she realises that she still loves him and wants to go to America with him.
1320;Bogart is every womans good guy/bad guy.
1321;All time favorite Bogart movie.
1322;Can't beat the cast of starts as well as the story line and action.
1323;Must be a 'Ricks Americana' somewhere!
1324;It's a great classic that is worth seeing over and over again!
1325;So many talented actors this movie never gets old.
1326;I've enjoyed it many times and now am recommending it to my sons and daughters.
1327;Pop culture as all over this beauty.
1328;i highly recommend this gorgeous box set, which gives the movie its rightful treatment as one of the all.
1329;This 70th Anniversary edition of what i would call the best movie i have ever seen of the old Film Noir movies , Bogart in his wonderful role of the casino/club owner Richard Blaine .
1330;The Cast is a wonderful group of actors and supporting actors of the time.
1331;for my money , this is absolutely the best
1332;This is by far the best looking classic movie I have ever seen.
1333;This happens to be my favorite movie of all time and I have seen this movie I would think over 30 times but seeing it on blu ray was like seeing it for the first time.
1334;It was such a clear looking film with great depth on blu ray.
1335;The story alone with the amazing actors of Hollywoods Golden age makes this a MUST Blu Ray.
1336;Do it again Sam and watch it!
1337;Great performances by great one of a kind actors.
1338;Every time I see this movie, it's like the first time.
1339;the movie is a classic.
1340;pop some pop corn, curl up next to your honey and enjoy.
1341;Just a good movie with great acting, that is not dependent on hi.
1342;Even in black and white this is a great movie to watch.
1343;And, my wife tells me the Madarin subtitles are good.
1344;I think the Roger Ebert commentary is very strong and extremely enjoyable.
1345;The big strength of his remarks is the consistent way he shows a closeness and intensity in viewing the film.
1346;Hearing the details he mentions and the larger purposes he ties to them really makes you want to watch all movies more attentively.
1347;He points out intricate effects with lighting and shadow (on the back of Ingrid Bergman's head to give her a halo effect), and he relates these cinematic touches to the emotions and content of the film.
1348;Ebert is an ideal guide with whom to experience the movie.
1349;But all this historical information is interesting and balances the more interpretive, appreciative commentary that Roger Ebert provides.
1350;It is never boring, but Ebert's remarks truly renew one's enthusiasm for the film.
1351;Oh my, what can I say about this classic movie!
1352;This romantic film will come in handy many times.
1353;Own it and you'll always have the perfect evening for that special someone or two or three
1354;Casablanca is a war movie which features a unique and mysterious love triangle.
1355;Rick has always wondered why she strangely vanished out of his life in Paris, and it is this mystery that the film centers on.
1356;There is more dialogue than action, but the dialogue sets up an ever.
1357;And the passionate dilemma that Ilsa faces in whether or not to choose her long.
1358;lost love above her husband was daring even for the forties.
1359;Casablanca is a clean movie, the acting is superb, the characterization beautifully portrayed, and above all it features a stunning plot with a thrilling climax.
1360;"here's looking at you kid and ""Play it again Sam"" ."
1361;Have heard the movie and a few lines so finally watched it and was pretty good not a great detailed love story but was good.
1362;i owned the original VHS Movie of Casablanca and found out I loved this movie more than I thought I would.
1363;com and ordered it as a gift for me.
1364;i was surprised and can say I loved it!I learned so much about the actor and his life's work and I really enjoyed the new remastered copy of Casablanca.
1365;Casablanca, my all time favorite movie.
1366;This version is a good deal with lots of trailers, behind scenes stuff and of course the actual movie, one of Bogart's best.
1367;And of course we'll always have Paris.
1368;if you've never seen it, and there are fewer of them every year, you are in for a treat.
1369;Yes it's political, yes the women are not quite the strong figures we get today, but it a cute to look back anyway.
1370;This was the first movie I viewed on my phone and I'm eager to watch another.
1371;This is what B&W on the big screen should look like .
1372;get this to see how good the cinematography really was in those days!
1373;it's also a good movie!
1374;Ingrid Bergman is so beautiful.
1375;So many famous lines, loved hearing them again.
1376;While the image restoration is really decent (not great though) the sound is no better than the previous BD release.
1377;Just received this, excellent packaging, the book, coasters and poster are ALL fabulous!
1378;"After all, you've got your work, your cursed integrity and principles, and you sing a mean version of ""The Marseillaise,"" so take some satisfaction in your mission and leave us lovebirds alone."
1379;It does what the best movies always have done: tells a great story with wit, sophistication, a sense of intrigue, an expression nobility.
1380;It's got it all, and even better, it's totally unpretentious.
1381;She never anticipated that Ilsa in CASABLANCA would become her signature role.
1382;and it's certainly one of Bogart's greatest too.
1383;"As the special feature on Bogie indicates, he was an actor thoroughly dedicated to his profession, and while his range may have been limited (or his casting options ""typed"") by this point in his career, audiences knew that he was much more than just a screen tough guy."
1384;it's also interesting how much commentary there is in the features about how much an ensemble player Bogart really was.
1385;It's hard to think of a more individualistic screen presence than Humphrey Bogart: yet it's also true that his best roles are in films with brilliant supporting players.
1386;the qualified ending is happy enough.
1387;Everybody gets to feel good about themselves in the end, as even Renault finds he's capable of something like nobility after all.
1388;Bogart is better in the African Queen than in this movie.
1389;It has the explanation of how and why film made plus incite to the actors.
1390;Just don't make excellent movies like this any longer.
1391;Casablanca usaually ranks as one of the top movies of all times and rightly so.
1392;A true classic that withstands the test of time.
1393;CASABLANCA is okay at best.
1394;i will , however, defend the right of anyone to just EMBRACE this movie as their own.
1395;After all, I happen to really enjoy HOWARD THE DUCK .
1396;a film that I believe has me as it's only fan of in this country.
1397;This was definitely worth every penny.
1398;And it is a good keepsake to have because this is the best movie every made.
1399;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1400;A must see for all generations.
1401;It is very interesting that, in its time this was a very interesting and significant story.
1402;It is also much notable the efforts made by the actors and the producer to perform without the technical help of this days.
1403;Strongly recommended, especially for Casablanca fans like us who never miss a chance to seeing it again!
1404;The movie is a classic.
1405;Bogart is superb on this classic tale of love and betrayal.
1406;One of the greatest love stories of all time.
1407;Bogart showcases his fantastic acting ability bringing heft and grit to his role.
1408;Bergman, Henreid, Greenstreet and Rains all contribute in a brilliant way.
1409;This cinematic masterpiece won 3 Academy Awards in 1943: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.
1410;The acting as is timeless as the movie itself.
1411;Screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make the perfect pair as star.
1412;Paul Henreid is memorable as resistance fighter/leader Victor Laszlo.
1413;Peter Lorre is subtly devious as the scheming Ugarte.
1414;The movie works very well, not only in terms of story, but the techniques that were used: flashbacks where almost all of it was music, close.
1415;ups of the characters in the right places, etc.
1416;"Max Steiner (Oscar winner for ""Gone With The Wind"" four years earlier) composed the score for this bittersweet tale of love, intrigue and patriotism."
1417;"This movie also should've won Bogie the Oscar for Best Actor, Ms. Bergman Best Actress, Mr. Steiner Best Score and Best Song (""As Time Goes By"")."
1418;"One of the movie's final lines, ""Round Up The Usual Suspects"", was the inspiration for the mind."
1419;"winning film ""The Usual Suspects."""
1420;This film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a classic.
1421;"Features the famous line ""Here's looking at you, kid"" and the timeless song ""As Time Goes By."""
1422;It's a classic and I love to watch it with people that haven't experienced it.
1423;good movie, order and enjoy
1424;One of the most fabulous movies of all times!
1425;A classic romance film that you cannot go wrong with!
1426;Enjoyed the old classic music and seeing the stars of cinema presented in a time before all the technology we see in today's films.
1427;I've known of this movie all my life and finally got a chance to view it in private.
1428;The story and the actors perform together flawlessly.
1429;This is possibly the greatest American made movie ever produced.
1430;Everything about this movie is outstanding.
1431;This is a great movie for men and women, so bring a date along with you!
1432;it just gets on another level, and plays with one's emotions.
1433;victor lazlo, incensed, stands up and walks to the band leader, where he perfectly delivers a laconic line.
1434;up, and as we can plainly see, she is crying.
1435;"will appreciate the classic ""Casablanca""."
1436;ray but this transfer is perfect.
1437;There is a crispness and depth that comes through and makes it look new.
1438;This is one of my favorite movies and this 70th Anniversary set was a real treat.
1439;There is a lot of special features, I particularly liked the one on director Micheal Curtiz.
1440;Simply put, this is a timeless classic from thee title song to Bogart's last lines This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
1441;The best movie of all time, beyond critisizm,
1442;"The setting of Morocco and Rick's Caf Americain jump from the screen in breathtaking crystal clarity."""
1443;CASABLANCA is a GOOD movie and is fast.
1444;"Bergman is a revelation
I:8499;1445;The greatest movie of all time
I:8499;1446;The ancient memories will emerge and the drama will take two opposite directions .
I:8499;1447;The inner and hidden emotions that still feel one for each other and the duty , the loyalty and the patriotic sense who meet this disturbing triangle .
I:8499;1448;But Ricky is a honor (strange word in the present times do not you?)
I:8499;1449;The smart chase runs for Claude Rains ( in a scorching role ) and his persuasive moods over Ricky , and the fear for being discovered make of that film a solid gem that has overcome its own time to become in a real masterpiece through the years .
I:8499;1450;bogart gives a perfect performance and Ingrid Bergman is extraordinary too .
I:8499;1451;The dazzling direction of Michael Curtiz is another punch point .
I:8499;1452;The masterpiece is preeminent in movie making with a stellar cast and unescapable zeal that infuses the story.
I:8499;1453;i haven't watched it yet but when I was a little kid I thought it was a great movie to watch if you where in love.
I:8499;1454;Casablanca is simply the best movie ever made.
I:8499;1455;I think that there is a generational divide to a certain extent because it was made so long ago, but a person of any age who really gets involved in the movie can always feel its true power and emotion.
I:8499;1456;the most beautiful woman ever, after my wife, Igrid Bergman, certainly makes the movie easy to watch .
I:8499;1457;This movie is a fantastic classic of love, hate, passion, WWII intrigue, super acting and a heartbreaker.
I:8499;1458;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8499;1459;Each scene is fascinatingly complex and elegant.
I:8499;1460;The stoic Humphrey Bogart is unforgettable.
I:8499;1461;I love the middle eastern influence throughout.
I:8499;1462;I see this movie at least four times a year and it always transports me to another era.
I:8499;1463;Even though Bogart as Rick never said play it again, still watch and enjoy a classic film.
I:8499;1464;The best thing about the older movies is they depend on acting, camera work and lighting and not effects.
I:8499;1465;It is as should be, in B&W and still as enjoyable to watch and, see why Bogart had the appeal he did and still does have.
I:8499;1466;Happy to have this great movies in my personal collection.
I:8499;1467;Delivery time was excellent, I believe that I got it one day after I ordered!
I:8499;1468;It is in excellent condition and I got it for an excellent price.
I:8499;1469;This was a great find and on sale for the holidays, Arrived earlier than quoted date which is always great, everything was in perfect condition and would recomend this to any collector, its a great film and this is a great boxset.
I:8499;1470;thanks for the perfect professionalism.
I:8499;1471;The directors managed to recreate a world so real and vivid that even in black and white the characters and events were complete and vibrant.
I:8499;1472;Many excellent romantic movies have been made over the ensuing decades, but you should watch Casablanca at least once, for it has influenced the English language.
I:8499;1473;I like to spend New Year's Eve watching my favorite movie: Casablanca.
I:8499;1474;The film has all the ingredients for a terrific story .
I:8499;1475;Ingrid Bergman's luminous presence along with a top notch cast including Bogie, Claude Rains, Peter Lorrie and Paul Henreid make this movie a classic.
I:8499;1476;Casablanca, as escape for refugees and a haven for spies, exudes its own corrupt and exotic ambiance.
I:8499;1477;Even if you're not a fan of classic movies, Casablanca is worth watching just to understand the cultural references that it inspired including a great Bugs Bunny parody Carrotblanca that I remember watching as a kid!
I:8499;1478;This is one of those films you become immersed in as you watch.
I:8499;1479;It was great to see one of the classics I had heard so much about.
I:8499;1480;It was very good but I have seen better .
I:8499;1481;just didn't feel it deserved a full 5 stars.
I:8499;1482;The movie industry will never make a film like this again.
I:8499;1483;It is truly one of the greats.
I:8499;1484;Casablanca is by far one of the single best movies ever made and winner of best picture back in 1943.
I:8499;1485;Looks like the beggining of a beautiful friendship.
I:8499;1486;I just own the regular version not any of the special editions of this movie, but I have watched it many times over these past few years and still never get tired of watching it, plus has one of the most pretty actress during that era in the actress named Ingrid Bergman.
I:8499;1487;But if your looking for a classic drama movie with many famous lines within the movie and people's choice as one of best movies ever made in movie history then pick this movie up and add it to your collection because it is worth every cent.
I:8499;1488;we bought it for an Uncle of ours who had been wanting to finish watching it, he finally finished it all.
I:8499;1489;Casablanca gives us the many facets of love.
I:8499;1490;Love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken."""""""
1491;Casablanca gives us the full human drama of living and loving.
1492;Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are superb.
1493;Bogart is cool and reserved but surprisingly becomes fully human and redeeming.
1494;Ingrid is a lovely, poised, intelligent woman who knows the truth and believes her choice will make a difference for human kind.
1495;A love triangle that has many twists.
1496;I got this for a friend and he loves it
1497;A classic tail of love, heroism and honor.
1498;Very romantic, sentimental and still not syrupy sweet.
1499;The story moves along nicely, has its intrigue and a great ending.
1500;There is no doubt that this movie is one of the best of early classic Hollywood movies.
1501;it is simply worth of watching.
1502;Through this movie, Michael Curtiz succesfully combined the aspect of romance, discourse of the nation, the individual and politics.
1503;I like the characters, actors, music and of cuorse main actors.
1504;The movie is an inspiration to courage and independency.
1505;But, as a piano player, I ,of course, love the song As Time Goes By .
1506;and it suits kid and Rick so well in this gorgeous classic!
1507;I truly enjoyed it to the extent that it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite movies.
1508;What it does have is a great script, suberb acting by all and deservedly minimal direction.
1509;top in Maltese Falcon, but in Casablanca he is truly a gem to watch.
1510;Ingrid Bergman is always a pleasure to watch and she shows why she was one of the best leading ladies in Hollywood.
1511;The rest of the cast is also good, even Peter Lorrie in a very small (but important) role.
1512;This movie tells a story that is still relevant today .
1513;Wether the story is set against the backdrop of World War II or today, it's still a story that has meaning to everyone.
1514;I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about.
1515;this is a real collector for movie buffs like me
1516;This movie shows how it's really great story and screenplay writing and not computer generated, special effects or explicit sex that makes a good movie.
1517;One of the greatest films ever.
1518;The packaging for this is simply brilliant.
1519;Many memorable lines, intrigue, love, still in original black and white format.
1520;Enjoy film at its best.
1521;Bogart and Bergman plus intrigue and WW2.
1522;What makes it so classic?
1523;For starters, there is such a well constructed script, full of memorable dialogue and scenes, which is all the more impressive given the chaos under which it seems to have been written (I've read the writers didn't even know how they were going to end it and that it changed on almost a daily basis).
1524;There's Claude Rains, witty, charming, and sly as the chief of police, in a perfect performance.
1525;There's a great supporting cast, including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.
1526;There's a terrific musical score, as well as fine direction (in a style that you wouldn't expect from Michael Curtiz).
1527;If anyone considers themselves a fan of movies, this film is required viewing.
1528;great movie, just chock full of classic lines that have become part of our culture.
1529;Great and timeless love story.
1530;This is truly one of the best films ever made!
1531;I have now bought it and have to say that this really is a classic, and it can stand with, and against, movies of today.
1532;Two of the best actors ever with a spectacular supporting cast.
1533;It is a timeless story, which will entertain and move you.
1534;It's a timeless love story that still resonates in the 21st century.
1535;Casablanca is definitely a product of its time, but also a classic of the genre.
1536;Ingrid Bergman is such a wonderful actress.
1537;He is also good in the African Queen.
1538;They don't make them like this anymore and that's a good thing.
1539;keeps movies like this special.
1540;I still think its amazing though that Bogie was voted the best actor of all time.
1541;I got this for my Father, he liked it and mentioned if the movie lasted 5 more minutes he would have had gotten cancer from all the smoking!LOL!
1542;A great movie, from how it was shot to how good the script was.
1543;The actors in this one make it come together, and it's a perennial classic with good reason.
1544;After editing, we must all make sure it really edits the number.
1545;Well, it's the first of an All Time Classic love story.
1546;Will be remembered by generations to come as the Greatest!
1547;I had seen this many years ago but it was so well done you had to see more and not miss any of the things that were happening in the room.
1548;This is a classic that should not be overlooked.
1549;It is wonderful and romantic.
1550;And we loved the other characters, the piano player, the local gendarme, Peter Lazlo.
1551;Casablanca has every element necessary for a classic.
1552;War, romance, betrayal, friendship, great music with a memorable theme.
1553;I loved it, I've seen other classic films but if you're getting into this world of oldies, this movie would be a good start because it is a well known movie.
1554;The lighting is rich, luminous, and the grays beautifully scaled lending excellent depth to the picture.
1555;the sound too is crisp and marvelously preserved.
1556;Instead we are given a soundtrack, that while still monophonic, is the best yet heard.
1557;fixed and now, finally, physically ageless.
1558;time great is presented well in the Two.
1559;clean transfer, great character actors, timeless story.
1560;This is an all time classic and the good news is that a cheaper single disc blu.
1561;This is great news for people who just want the classic movie, even though it will be single disc, there will be plenty of extras on it to enjoy as well!
1562;One of the best love stories tied with history thy is out there.
1563;Streamed real well from the computer to the tv
1564;One of the best EVER.
1565;Can be seen again and again and again and you always find something new in every scene.
1566;Bogie is the man of course and Ingrid Bergman makes the screen shine with her beauty and talent.
1567;Because all they do is talk.
1568;You take away the locale and the nazis and that's all it is.
1569;A lot of professional reviewers praise it because they base it around World War II.
1570;according to the AFI this movie is #2 in the best movies of all time.
1571;It's right above The Godfather.
1572;final words: If this movie is so great then could anybody tell me the director or the screenwriter?
1573;How can you rate a classic like this.
1574;If you have seen it, see it again.
1575;One of the best movies ever!
1576;If I had the chance to pick a few titles to take with me into the afterlife, this one would be in the top 5.
1577;This is one of the best movies of all time, and is as relevant today as it was in 1942.
1578;this is one of our top 10 best movies of all time.
1579;We are always impressed that just about every word spoken in Casablanca is pertinent to the story.
1580;What a perfect hint for me to give it to her.
1581;She and many granddaughters watched it together.
1582;This classic has been quoted from so many times I know some parts by heart.
1583;Ingrid Bergman is an great actress
1584;lol I know that it is soppiest to be a great love story, but really Rick is a sap.
1585;Best love story of all time.
1586;Great cast,great writing and great characters!!
1587;My heart thrills as I watch this movie.
1588;This for me is the romantic movie par excellant.
1589;The hope for love, the dashed desires, the renewal of possibility.
1590;and the ending, the amazing ending, unexpected by even the actors, is true romance.
1591;Ideals, and desires, and love are all one, in the decisions we must finally make in life.
1592;Perhaps it's more appropriate to say it has everything to do with Casablanca.
1593;And how the Moroccans had to fight a bloody war of resistance to the French occupation after WWII to win their freedom.
1594;so we bear this in mind as we watch.
1595;But then, accepting the lack of reality, it is a wonderful movie of romance, and I will happily dispense with reality for a brief bit of idealism any day.
1596;"I won't write even one word about the film itself
I:8499;1597;On my computer's 19 monitor, it was as clear, crisp and sharp as it would have been on the silver screen.
I:8499;1598;Again and again my wife and I found ourselves gasping at the perfection and beauty of the cinematography, the lighting, the sets, the shots, the angles.
I:8499;1599;Get a big monitor, a fast computer, and a good sound system.
I:8499;1600;tome classic worth all the hype that has been heaped upon it over the years.
I:8499;1601;This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals, and, of course, beautiful young girls for Captain Reneaud.
I:8499;1602;Give Major Strasser the best table, one next to the ladies.
I:8499;1603;( I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway ).
I:8499;1604;Let's just preserve it in its original, pristine form so that it can be experienced to its fullest degree by future generations?
I:8499;1605;Maybe in some distant time, the world will return to the magnificent naivete that wrought this masterpiece in the first place.
I:8499;1606;More than perhaps any other film from the 1940s, Casablanca stands the test of time and holds incredible power and emotion for what should be any generation.
I:8499;1607;ray box set more than does justice to the film.
I:8499;1608;As an adult I try to watch it about once a year.
I:8499;1609;It's one of my top five favorite movies.
I:8499;1610;But there's a magic in there somewhere.
I:8499;1611;deep story and modern performers can often act circles around these classic actors, but the quick dialog, character interactions, and sense of humor in a time of impending doom continues to draw me back.
I:8499;1612;baloney dramatics, Bogie's flashbacks and the manipulative but powerful scene in the bar where the French and Germans start singing their national anthems and just let yourself be pulled into their world and enjoy a very fine film that somehow makes it all click.
I:8499;1613;This is my favorite movie.
I:8499;1614;An amazing era, the greatest generation and wonderful movie.
I:8499;1615;if you don't know that line by heart and WHY it matters watch the film!
I:8499;1616;Great movie to watch, love the music and the entire story line.
I:8499;1617;it's a classic that everyone needs to watch if they haven't!
I:8499;1618;Great classic with some wonderful lines.
I:8499;1619;The golden age of Hollywood is long past, but thankfully we have Masterpieces like this to cherish and enjoy.
I:8499;1620;Casablanca is one of THE BEST romance movies of all time.
I:8499;1621;If you have, you know I'm right!
I:8499;1622;So much of this film is engrained into our cultural consciousness from the countless spoofs and references that have come since then.
I:8499;1623;Things are going good for him as he deigns to keep out of business that doesn't concern him.
I:8499;1624;The conflict inside Rick whether to look after his best interests or help the woman he still loves is certainly compelling stuff, but that isn't all.
I:8499;1625;There are so many memorable characters, from the ingratiating Captain Renault (played with relish by Claude Reins) to the weasely Ugarte (Peter Lorre).
I:8499;1626;The romance is also .
I:8499;1627;well, the reason why this movie is so timeless.
I:8499;1628;Though there are numerous lines that are justifiably classic, the rest is a rare work of brilliance as well.
I:8499;1629;bogart and Bergman, a rare pairing that results in one of cinema's greatest romances.
I:8499;1630;A great supporting cast rounds out the crowd"
1631;This was a film done in the old Hollywood studio system by all the rules, yet it inexplicably raises itself above and beyond that.
1632;It is a remarkable motion picture masterpiece.
1633;I thought this movie would be a lot better to tell you the truth.
1634;Being that its a classic movie I thought it would have a better plot!
1635;This is the greatest movie ever made.
1636;The music, setting, actors/actresses, and the sets make this the best of all movies.
1637;"Casablanca is often on ""Greatest of All Time"" lists and deservedly so."
1638;Casablanca, in my humble opinion, is that type of film that filmmakers should use as a template for what to do right.
1639;A niche plotline cast in an interesting setting.
1640;But like any good piece of art, there are levels to be uncovered.
1641;Subtle nuances that build a solid foundation for a beautiful story.
1642;the characters, acted wonderfully, are interesting in their own right, and each could have their own film about their lives.
1643;The location is the perfect catalyst, as is the geopolitical situation in which the characters find themselves.
1644;There is, in its way, the perfect dance of melancholy and joy.
1645;More, the film knows when to end itself and it does so on the perfect note.
1646;the film is timeless, and whatever form you choose to view it, you will not be dissapointed.
1647;paced, full of unexpected plot twists, visually very rich and varied, and peppered with humor in a very.
1648;enjoy it for the intrigue, enjoy it as a WWII memoir, enjoy it for the humor, enjoy it for the superb acting, enjoy it for the music, and enjoy it for the love story.
1649;This is a film which somehow magically grows in its appeal as the viewer grows in life's experiences.
1650;the themes are wonderfully resonant with the viewer.
1651;redemption from past mistakes, knowing when to act and when to keep your peace, and the sacrifice of the opportunity of a lifetime (the chance to resurrect the love of your life) for a greater good .
1652;What I like about this movie is that it derives it enduring charm through great story telling.
1653;This movie captures the anxiety of this era .
1654;Notwithstanding this movie is a classic love story set in war.
1655;It is one of my favorites.
1656;This is one of my favorite movies of all.
1657;many of the special features are holdovers from previous formats, but they are great for both first.
1658;This is definitely the best the film has ever looked.
1659;It's only icing on the cake that Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all.
1660;I always heard that this film was great.
1661;So I thought that I would find out!
1662;After viewing this film people where right!
1663;Humphrey Bogart gave his best performance ever!
1664;The supporting cast was just down right great.
1665;The film does in a very smart way flash back to Paris from time to time and I thought that for once this was done well.
1666;A great acted, directed and scripted film.
1667;Among the best ever made!
1668;I enjoy the romance and era that this move is set in.
1669;Of course this is a perfect movie, but.
1670;the family really enjoyed seeing this piece of history again.

1672;bucks to possibly replace movies we already own!
1673;Growing up, I always wanted to watch this movie I had heard so much about.
1674;I have since watched this masterpiece a few more times, as it grows deeper and more perfect with each viewing.
1675;i was most impressed with Ingrid Bergman.
1676;Her lines were said naturally and her tears were even believable.
1677;He always managed to be in the middle of everything, and played a funny yet complicated role.
1678;"But as someone I know remarked, ""My gosh, it has one famous quote after another."""
1679;I have a friend in the film.
1680;golden Days in all ways!
1681;This is my ALL TIME favorite movie.
1682;This movie really should be rated 10 stars!
1683;Days of my youth in front of the B&W Zenith being entertained by some of the greatest actors ever and where the only effects was to use midgets to fuel the plane.
1684;Casablanca is perhaps the most classic classic movie of all time.
1685;Even after more than 60 years it still entertains well.
1686;the dialog is excellent .
1687;just a lot of wonderful lines.
1688;it's the romantic in me.
1689;renault: What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?Rick: My health .
1690;I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
1691;but the acting here is top.
1692;the background music (provided by Max Steiner) is excellent.
1693;but here it is as fresh and well.
1694;blended with the action as the day the movie was released.
1695;the spotlight is pretty bright on Bogie and Ingrid though .
1696;conrad Veidt is excellent as the bad guy .
1697;just a great great job at being menacing.
1698;Claude Rains perhaps had the most fun lines to speak, and he seems to have had fun saying them.
1699;Sydney Greenstreet is very excellent as Ferrari, and Peter Lorre is good also.
1700;S. z. Sakall is delightful as the waiter Carl .
1701;But maybe this helped the picture in a way .
1702;And when Rick lets that honest young man win at gambling, so he and his wife could afford the bribe to Captain Renault, he (Rick) is lauded for it.
1703;but it is a very watchable movie .
1704;addition to the 50th anniversary re.
1705;issue of Casablanca gives us some interesting tid.
1706;Casablanca is one of Hollywood's most beloved classic's.
1707;It's perfect, has memorable dialogue, well done humor, well written characters with real emotion, pride and dignity, and an intriguining plot.
1708;It's also very romantic and shows that a movie could end satisfying without the hero getting the girl.
1709;casablanca may be one the most romantic movies ever made it surprisingly has a bit of a march tone to it.
1710;so Casablanca works for both sexes, guys can relate to Bogart's Rick.
1711;Can't really think of any actor's that actually draw you in more into their roles than Humphrey Bograt and Ingred Bergman do in this movie.
1712;besides the acting being very good Michael Curtiz's direction is splendid.
1713;That light gives a presence that the Nazi's are there and that eventhough it's Rick's pub they pretty much have all the control over it.
1714;curtiz's also makes you feel as if you're at the airport at the end saying good.
1715;"He holds your complete attention right to Bogart's classic line at the end, ""Louie, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""."
1716;There's no wonder why Casablanca is such a huge favorite to so many, it's just perfect.
1717;What more can you ask for in a film.
1718;One of the best assembled casts in movie history.
1719;I can watch this movie over and over.
1720;Although I have watched this movie three times, I still moved by the beautiful love story.
1721;The actress is so beautiful.
1722;He's happy, which makes me pleased that I could find something for him that he really likes.
1723;A masterpiece that arose from chaos and confusion.
1724;Perhaps the best total cast of any film ever made!
1725;A great documentary comes with it along with other trailers for other Bogart films.
1726;An all time classic, the acting is top notch.
1727;One of the few films that I relish seeing again and again.
1728;Bogart is simply the best.
1729;I recommend this to anyone who believes today's movies even compare!
1730;I've watched this movie many many times and enjoy it every time.
1731;my wife watched it for the first time and she stayed awake which is our criteria for a very good movie in our house!
1732;This is one of the best all time movies.
1733;If you understand what makes a finely crafted film that you can watch repeatedly and still continue to find things out about it that you love, this is one you'll enjoy immensely.
1734;it is filled with tasty classic lines you'll really delight in hearing in the context of the film.
1735;Part of what makes all of it work is the vocal treatment by the actors in their delivery.
1736;The cast seems very comfortable with the characters they each play, and so maybe that relaxed feel carries over to the degree of realism you sense when you watch it.
1737;the acting is superb across the board regardless of how small the part.
1738;Bogie is really a powerhouse in this one, and Paul Henreid as well as Claude Rains deliver the kind of intimately detailed performances that just make you smile while you watch.
1739;Peter Lorre has a smaller part but exquisitely crafted in its execution.
1740;Sydney Greenstreet gives a solid presentation as well to round out the core ensemble performances given here.
1741;the special features on this disc include a very nice introduction by Lauren Bacall, Bogart's widow.
1742;Great slices of the period as far as movie promotion goes!
1743;They serve as great reminders of a simpler time in America.
1744;Not many films are able to do that.
1745;One of the best movies Ihave ever seen.
1746;Rick's cafe is full of all the old time great supporting players .
1747;Anyone who has ever seen this movie knows it is a pretty wonderful one, or at least so I'm told, I am not a big Bogart fan, so I'll just take people's word for it.
1748;Casablanca is a classic, one that I tend to pull out and watch at least once a year.
1749;The love triangle is devastating from the beginning, but add the danger and desperation of the situation, and it adds to this classic movie.
1750;Everyone should see this at least once.
1751;The new digital transfer from the original nitrites is incredibly clear.
1752;I haven't checked out the bonus material yet, but I screened the film as soon as I got it, and it looks awesome.
1753;One of the top ten movies of all time.
1754;Great story and terrific acting by all.
1755;And what movie has a greater song associated with it than As time goes by ?
1756;The answer is that this version is a lot better.
1757;The audio is much cleaner and stronger.
1758;A film by Michael CurtizThe American Film Institute ranked Casablanca as the second greatest movie of all time behind Citizen Kane.
1759;This is a movie that is not only an excellent film, but also one which has entered the consciousness of a nation so much that many people only know that some lines are famous and that perhaps they came from Casablanca.
1760;Besides the famous dialogue, though, this is simply a fine movie and is an example of excellence in filmmaking.
1761;It is 1941 and the world is in the midst of World War II.
1762;With such a grand background, this is a very simple story.
1763;Another runaway is traced to Ricks and while this could turn to a serious drama, it instead turns the film into a great romance and even a comedy with graceful touches.
1764;The success of this depends entirely on the characters and the actors playing the parts.
1765;But Rick is smooth and likeable, so this does not bother us too much.
1766;I truly believe that this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and that being the case I am not sure how to adequately describe this great film.
1767;It is just as vibrant a picture as it was 60 years ago when it was Oscars Best Picture in 1942.
1768;This is one of the finest movies ever.
1769;The filming of Casablanca has some very interesting facts and trivia.

1772;CASABLANCA is rightfully recognized as one of the best films ever made.
1773;To me, it is the best film ever made.
1774;It has a bit of everything which can be a recipe for disaster but, in this case, it all comes together to work a miracle.
1775;Round up the usual suspects!
1776;There is a romantic story.
1777;Two men love the same woman.
1778;Bogart plays Rick, the owner of a saloon who does very well for himself.
1779;The town is controlled by Vichy French and the prefect of police is a lovable cad played by Claude Raines.

1789;There are so many famous lines in this movie.
1790;One of the greatest movies ever made and no one wants to release it in wide.

1793;unparalleled romance adventure, which epitomizes everything that Hollywood filmmaking.
1794;Was there ever a more unlikely yet perfect pairing than the radiant Bergman and the world.
1795;Portraying the twilight of civilized society in a foreign place, and the rising menace of new world evils, director Curtiz masterfully juggles tragedy and humor, intrigue and action to tell a timeless story rich in personal and political detail.
1796;And what an indelible, heart.
1797;Casablanca won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, and continues to mesmerize on repeat viewings.

1805;Two of my all time favorite actors are at their very best in this flim.
1806;This latest edition is certainly the one to have, with one or two reservations.
1807;And we have to talk about Blu.
1808;that said, the full screen 4X3 picture is certainly pristine.
1809;There never will be a better love story, romance or adventure.
1810;Many Bugs Bunny cartoons will be funnier after you watch this.

1818;Anyway, good acting and a happy ending.

I:8499;1835;It's worth seeing at least once.
I:8499;1836;This is an absolutely timeless classic.
I:8499;1837;As someone who began life many decades after this film was created, I have to wonder which, if any, of our generation's movies will even come close to the classic feel or lasting appeal of """"Casablanca."""""""
1838;"I'm also able to recognize that old films such as ""Casablanca"" do have a limited appeal nowadays."
1839;the focus is on dialog, supporting pathos and ethos.
1840;But please, watch this movie, and for a moment try to picture a classier, more idealistic world, separate from the continuous dumbing down of popular culture.
1841;I enjoy watching old movies, and this is among the best.
1842;Without question, one of the most influential films of it's generation and one of the greatest love stories ever.
1843;Made on a back lot at Warner Bros this piece captures the essence of the early 40s, with a poignant love story woven into the story.
1844;Wonderful acting by all involved, especially Bogart.
1845;Cassablanca just might be the perfect movie, I'd give it 6 stars.
1846;This movie is the perfect guys romance, Bergman is the only woman he's only loved, she hurt him and now he doesn't give a damn about anything.
1847;The movie has wonderful acting, when Bogart enters the room and hears As Times Go By playing, he runs up to the piano and when he see Bogart you can see in his face that he's just had his guts ripped out and stuffed back in, that's acting.

1860;The anniversary set is top of the line for any and all fans of the movie.
1861;Best investment I ever made.
1862;Citizen Kane is often hailed as the greatest film of all time .
1863;or at least the greatest American film of all time.
1864;But in poll after poll Casablanca is rated as the best.
1865;And it deserves the accolades as well.
1866;A tense suspense film, a touching love story, a in between moments of great comedy.
1867;Bergman is luminous, achingly vulnerable, brave and more beautiful than ever.
1868;The whole supporting cast is amazing, from the troika of Greenstreet, Lorre and Raines, to the amazing Warner Bros. rep company.
1869;And the Nazis make the perfect villains.
1870;See it you haven't already.
1871;I envy the experience of discovering this classic.
1872;A towering accomplishment rarely visualized before or since, and easily one of the best films of all time.
1873;All of the extras you get are definitely worth the cost.
1874;The movie sold for a very fair price and shipping was fast.
1875;The movie was good and I would watch it again with a lady friend but I could have went my life without ever seeing it.
1876;Casablanca is a landmark film.
1877;"It's 64 years old and yet most of the dialogue is still quoted today, it's #2 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (just directly below ""Citizen Kane""), and is a true masterpiece of film."
1878;"This film is a beautiful and entertaining film
I:8499;1879;Back in 1942, the film won 3 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.
I:8499;1880;As I said, I've never seen a film with Humphrey Bogart before but the man is an amazing actor.
I:8499;1881;He has this way of speaking and a way of moving that really sucks you in.
I:8499;1882;Here's looking at you kid and """"I believe this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"""" is classic movie dialogue that we will no doubt here for a much longer time."""
1883;One of the greatest movies of all time.
1884;It's impact on our culture has been tremendous.
1885;Just take a look at AFI's list of all time great films.
1886;the movie is first rate and gripping.
1887;Needless to say each scene in the movie is a gem.
1888;And like Rick, America must make up its mind which side to support.
1889;having said all that, it also is one damn good love story.
1890;This is a 1942 movie that marks the high mark in the Bogart career of approximately 75 movies, many filmed at Warner Brothers in Hollywood.
1891;After the Maltese Falcon, he graduated to more complex parts including love stories, far removed from the early gangster roles.
1892;His next movie was the bittersweet love story Casablanca and the multiple Oscars.
1893;casablanca has all the extras and special effects, and in its day it was a big budget movie made factory style, completely on the lot at Warners.
1894;Casablanca is a wonderful and fascinating story of an American living in Casablanca during World War II running a nightclub.
1895;Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre are perfect for their supporting parts and they add a certain attraction and exotic flair, and depth and mystery to the movie.
1896;After Bogart and Bergman, the French police chief Louis Renault played by Claude Rains is the dominant actor.
1897;"the special effects, the fog, the music ""As Time Goes By"" played by Dooley Wilson are all beautifully done, and when Lazlo and his wife (Bergman) walk out to the plane through the night fog to escape to Lisbon and on to America with Rick's blessing (Bogart) one cannot help but shed a tear."
1898;But it all comes together to make magic.
1899;possibly the best movie ever made, and definitely in the top 10, and the best of the 1940s film noir era.
1900;Also, I recommend Double Indeminity, made a few years later, and another great film noir movie.
1901;It was a classic and did not disappoint.
1902;Had seen it so many years ago, forgot how good it was.
1903;One of the top favorite movies of all time is a knockout in Hi.
1904;The more one watches this entertaining, well.
1905;written, and finely paced and nuanced classic, the more you realize why it deserves its lofty perch as one of the most enduring and endearing movies of all time.
1906;The dialogue is witty, crisp, and memorable.
1907;There is just enough symbolism and larger themes overarching the plot to put the story in it historical context, and yet it remains timeless.
1908;In the end it is about the universal quests for love and liberty, and a reminder that life in challenging times can make heroes of us all.
1909;"This is one of the greatest movies of the ""good war"" and all times."
1910;I chose this product because it has a very good presentation, this very complete and the film is one of my favorites, plus special editions yup box formatLittle to say this perfect, classic film recommended

1915;Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's one time love.
1916;The film strings itself together amazingly, bringing the characters together with a vivid spark.
1917;The three screenwriters do a brilliant job of showing off their marvellous skills, each have added their special part in Casablanca, and they all make it a memorable and intriguing idea, one of the most praised scripts ever put to film.
1918;The performances truly burn in memory, Humphrey Bogart is fascinating, this may very well be his best performance.
1919;He is remarkably moving as Rick Blaine, and makes the film's watchability boost to 100.
1920;Ingrid Bergman is stunning as well, she strides onto the screen with stunning beauty and power, and is a mezmerising romantic touch.
1921;them' thought is a brilliantly done aspect of the film, and it sustains right to the very end, when we know the characters true self.
1922;casablanca is a great explosion of a film, not to be missed.
1923;Without this movie, romance films may of never been so powerful.
1924;Thank you, Mr. Curtiz, you've bought true love to our screens.
1925;Fun to see this old movie that I've always heard quotes from.
1926;Interesting characters and a bit of history to learn from it also.
1927;funny how he's isn't that good looking or physically imposing but yet he has something few men project, anyway I watch this at least once a year, never get tired of it

1941;It is the true benchmark film for all love stories with an all star cast.
1942;His former lover comes into his night club with a husband who is a freedom fighter escaping from the nazis.

1950;I highly recommend this movie.
1951;I treat myself to this wonderful classic every year.
1952;It is a joy to own.
1953;This is a must have movie for your video library!
1954;I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight.
1955;especially when the ending of this 1942 classic leaves you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.
1956;With a great story and an all.

1958;It was rated by the American Film Institute as being the best romance movie of all time.
1959;It is also one of my personal favorites, and a movie that I would highly recommend you see if you haven't.
1960;casablanca also contains tons of memorable scenes and quotes that really make it a treasure, and cause the movie to be remembered forever.
1961;Recommend to have and loved the time period of the movie.
1962;This has been a favorite movie of mine forever.
1963;I watch this movie about twice a year and the set has enhanced that experience for me.
1964;As time goes by, this remains for many people the greatest movie ever made.
1965;Start with one of the greatest, if not the greatest actors ever, in his best screen role as Rick.
1966;Then back it up with a suspenseful and exciting script with one of the best supporting casts ever put together.
1967;Louie is given many great lines but Raines makes them more special with his performance.
1968;A great line made even better by the way in which it's delivered.
1969;greenstreet is also perfect as is Lorre.
1970;Throw in an Academy Award winning song and that is how you get to the best movie ever made.
1971;I hope younger audiences find this great movie.
1972;I enjoyed the movie and it had a good story line and plot to it.
1973;Wonderful acting, music and shooting Nazis.

1975;A film of striking emotion that's scatheing as well as entertaing.
1976;Still one of the greatest movies of all time.
1977;Classic story of love, war and espionage.
1978;Obviously there is a lot of hype about this old movie, calling it one of the greatest films ever made and all that.
1979;My opinion on the hype is this: there are plenty of films out there that have more psychological insight into its characters and explore deeper themes than CASABLANCA does.
1980;Despite the fact that it uses a wartime setting and has a cast of various nationalities, it merely uses these elements as a backdrop to a Hollywood.
1981;style Hollywood entertainment, but that's really all it is.
1982;style Hollywood entertainment, it is pretty glorious.
1983;earth, and the actors help make it convincing and fun to watch, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles.
1984;Bogart, especially, does a good job with bringing out the sides of his character Rick Blaine, a man who outwardly shows cynicism and indifference, but deep inside still has feelings for Ilsa Lund and really does want to help her and her husband escape the country.
1985;(His final sacrificial act at the end of CASABLANCA is one of the most sublime things Hollywood has ever dreamed up.)
1986;classic dialogue of this movie, which remains nicely edgy and flavored.
1987;All in all, here is a romantic movie that never gets soapy, and its honesty of feeling is something to be truly admired.
1988;cASABLANCA remains, to this day, an example of Hollywood entertainment at its skillful best.
1989;It doesn't have ambitions to be anything other than diverting, and on that level it succeeds magnificently.
1990;This is the best movie ever made.
1991;Chemistry between Rick and Ilsa is amazing.
1992;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1993;I call it magical because for some reason it makes you feel so good when you watch it.
1994;I judge a movie by how many times you watch it and I have seen Casablanca in its entirety more than 2 dozen times, I love it that much.
1995;The characters are so rich and warm that you can't help but fall in love with all of them.
1996;The music is pure magic as well.
1997;you will to, but like fine wine, it gets better with age.
1998;One of the finest American films ever made.
1999;Perfectly cast, well directed, and superbly scripted.
2000;One of the most popular of Bogart's movies, this is a classic that shouldn't be missed.
2001;In my humble opinion this is the best film ever.
2002;Paul Henreid exudes class and bravery.
2003;A witty screenplay, taut direction and an emotinal core that builds throughout the film right up to the most memorable ending of all.
2004;But has everyone seen it.

2015;the special effects were pretty good!
2016;I can watch this movie over and over again.
2017;In the end, Casablanca will provide a suspenseful adventure interlaced with love and greed with honorable and cynical characters.
2018;It's interesting when you count how many very famous lines came from this movie, including the one that never was said.
2019;This is a wonderful movie from start to finish.

2029;Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart make Hollywood's most memorable couple in this classic story of love and intrigue, set during WWII.
2030;Enter the lovely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa, his love from pre.
2031;"But what to do with hubby?There is so much romantic tension between Bogie and Bergman
I:8499;2032;The nearest line is, """"Play it, Sam, for old times' sake."""
2033;So much of CASABLANCA is in the casting.
2034;"Humphrey Bogart is the lead, ruggedly, though not impossibly handsome, while his love interest, played by Ingrid Bergman, has inspired me to sit my son down in front of the screen with the explanation, ""That's a GIRL."""
2035;This film has a natural chemistry.
2036;that lifted it above its origins.
2037;He owns Rick's Cafe Americain, a classy nightclub where the denizens of wartime Casablanca.

2040;"Only Ilsa's loving heart saves his spirit
I:8499;2041;cASABLANCA is a true romance.
I:8499;2042;But there is something so glorious in the film that we wish we could be Rick and Ilsa.
I:8499;2043;CASABLANCA is its audience, perfected.
I:8499;2044;Excellent use of the technology of the day.
I:8499;2045;The dialogue is witty and uplifting.
I:8499;2046;I kind of wish people still spoke this way.
I:8499;2047;Interesting how a film this small (in length) can still have such a powerful effect on us today.
I:8499;2048;Though most would say it is a sappy, corny film for today"
2049;With such powerful and mesmerizing chemistry, these two light up the screen as never before.
2050;Bergman shows such innocence and beauty to this role that you kind of wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar (she was, however, nominated that same year in 1943 for Best Actress in FOR WHOM THE BELLS TOLL, she lost to Jennifer Jones).
2051;Bogart, of course, brings the rugged charm and swagger of the American to the otherwise foreign country of Casablanca.
2052;Bogart and Bergman bring the tenderness to the film as well, when they flashed back to the time they met in Paris .
2053;You can tell that Rains is having fun with this role, smiling every so often that you can't help but like the guy, even though he's on the German's side.
2054;(NOTE: Bogart, Greenstreet, Lorre, and Rains all co. starred together in 1941's THE MALTESE FALCON and other films for Warner Bros.)There are perhaps the most memorable lines in this film than any other.
2055;(A truly inspiring moment that even inspired me with my film PRISONER OF WAR!)
2056;It stirs up old memories and rekindles the old flame again.
2057;And there's that wonderful score by Max Steiner, who also wrote the moving score to GONE WITH THE WIND.

2064;Bogey is so wonderful in this one.
2065;right next to a sign that says.
2066;We all know that Casablanca is a classic romance.
2067;Not only are the picture and sound precise and clear, but the extra features are great.
2068;It's so neat to be able to see the original theatrical trailer, and to study the documentary.
2069;This is a must have for any movie lover!
2070;**oh, if you really want to have fun with this movie, select French with English subtitles.
2071;Great movie, even more great if you now a bit of history about WWII, the actors and the social norms of the time.
2072;I love this picture and it is one of my favorite Humphrey Bogart pics, so I immediately pre.
2073;The film looks amazing and the extras give you so much about the history of the picture and its stars.
2074;Casablanca includes the perfect blend of mystery, romance, humor, and intrigue.
2075;Bogie, the perfect dark hero with a heart of gold.
2076;Bergman, the flawless beauty torn between two men.
2077;Paul Henreid, the third side of this triangle and all the secondary characters which combine to make this my number one all time favorite movie.
2078;This is truly the best movie ever made.
2079;Clearly the best movie of all time.
2080;I have to watch it at least once every couple of years.
2081;The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film is amazing.
2082;The first time the two of them see each other in the film, you can see the whole history of the relationship just in Bergman's face.
2083;resistance who keeps escaping from the Nazis.
2084;It is a classic story of love and sacrifice, but Bogart's classic tough guy attitude, and his chemistry with Bergman makes this film unforgettable.
2085;Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made.
2086;This is a must see movie, A classic to be sure.
2087;But it keeps to the original integrity of the movie for it time.
2088;It's a rare tribute to those rare good guys in life, and if you like romance, it has that too.
2089;This movie, which is considered one of the best of all time, paired two of the greatest actors (Bogart and Bergman) with other multi.
2090;talented stars (Peter Lorre) to create a venue for this time in history.
2091;They will never be able to appreciate Casablanca or any movie with great characters, intelligent dialog, and great pacing leading up to a historic ending.
2092;When one can study the various characters and see the nuances and subtleties each bring to every scene.
2093;I love this latest packaging concerning this Classic film.
2094;"It has what I was looking for
I:8499;2095;casablanca is that 1943 wartime favorite love story, with a most unforgettable cast.
I:8499;2096;The French have just capitulated to the Germans and established the Vichy government, a puppet pro.
I:8499;2097;Claude Rains plays the chief of police and shrewdly entertains the German occupiers, as he continues taking care of number one.
I:8499;2098;casablanca is a love story about nationalism and of people.
I:8499;2099;the second disc contains the usual features one might expect"
2100;I watch this movie every few years.
2101;Casablanca uses the actors and the story to tell a very interesting and compelling story and is an all.
2102;time classic movie that should be seen by all.
2103;But I do save so physical space in my collection for those items that are truly worth it, and this Two Disc Special Edition of Casablanca happened to be one of those, and probably my favorite.
2104;I specially loved the looney tunes special CarrotBlanca.
2105;The music by Louis Armstrong was great.
2106;In my humble opinion, this is the greatest Humphrey Bogart movie, and one of the greatest of all times.
2107;Claude Rains is perfect in his role, and the supporting actors and actresses make this an incredible film!
2108;What the filmmakers did with black and white is exquisite!
2109;I would recommend this film to anyone!
2110;Great movie on all levels .

2114;"round up the usual suspects"" inspired a movie of its own."
2115;"The most famous quote of all is one that was never uttered in Casablanca: ""Play it again, Sam."""
2116;And that brings up the music.
2117;As Time Goes By is not the only standard made timeless by its use in Casablanca.
2118;It is a comic strip, a hotch.
2119;At once a tangle of Eternal Archetypes comes into play.
2120;But usually to make a good story a single archetypal situation is enough.
2121;Eco's language is familiar to anyone who's read Joseph Campbell.
2122;These ideas influenced a generation of film makers .
2123;Pointing up its mediocrity they merely prove its lasting greatness.
2124;But soon and for the rest of your life!

2126;guy veneer and he allows his one true love to slip out of his life for good because it is the right thing to do in the dark days of 1941.
2127;Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this classic!
2128;Casablanca is an example of an almost perfect movie.
2129;From the writing, to the cinematography, to the direction, and of course to the acting of everyone in the film, Casablanca takes us on a journey that we don't soon forget.
2130;It is a real lesson in fine film making.
2131;I'm pretty sure I will enjoy it a lot more when Warner Bros finally gets around to releasing the colorized version, the way this movie needs to be seen .
2132;The movie was good in general and the actors had good performances.
2133;The war story behind the movie makes it more interesting.
2134;One of the best movies ever made.
2135;you get history, mystery and a love story rolled into one movie with fantastic acting from the best actors and actress of the time.
2136;Bought it for my wife's anniversary and she loved it.
2137;Just the story and performances that make this one of our favorite films.
2138;Like a fine novel that one wishes to re.
2139;I do it because I believe it.
2140;casablanca is in the running for the greatest movie ever made.
2141;It is uplifting and emotional.
2142;one of my favorite scenes is the one in Rick's when the Germans begin singing their song, and Laszlo decides not to take it.
2143;It is as subtle as a rap in the head.
2144;world War Two was the single most important event in human history.
2145;Other wars are shades of gray against each other, with both good and evil on both sides.
2146;I just need to cast my vote and reward this wonderful movie with the highest rating.
2147;Although the technology was primitive the characters and their portrayal by the actors was brilliant.
2148;Ingrid Bergman is beautiful and enchanting.
2149;Bogart is so charismatic and troubled.
2150;Their chemistry is undeniable and the plot intriguing.
2151;A classic of all time.
2152;I bought this item for my son, the telecommunication major.
2153;This movie is his favorite all time screenplay and with the special features included in this set, he was thrilled.
2154;Thanks to Amazon for this great featured item and their excellent delivery.
2155;One of my all time favorites!
2156;Really makes you think about good vs right and good vs evil.
2157;It is a family favorite.
2158;This 1942 film is a classic, and rightly so.
2159;It's releasecoincidentally coincided with the Nazi occupation of France, and itstheme and its timeless love story caught the public'simagination.
2160;It isseething with intrigue and corruption.
2161;There's intrigue and double dealing.
2162;And the acting is so good that it brought meright into Casablanca.
2163;There wasan interview with the man who did the music.
2164;It was the same powerful emotion that I felt too.
2165;Shot from a distance and througha fog it was realistic and served the same kind of purpose oftoday's video imaging and special effects.
2166;"Paul Henried's last line to Humphrey Bogart points out that the great ""Casablanca"", lauded today as a romance, was in fact more importantly a propaganda movie."
2167;That reich had managed to conquer most of Europe.
2168;"So that when Conrad Veidt's Nazi General Strasser asks Bogart's Rick how he'll feel when the Nazis walk into London, Rick's ""I'll tell you when you get there"" is a hopeful boast that England will continue to hold out."
2169;"we'll win
I:8499;2170;And the guy who must turn away love when it's his again.
I:8499;2171;He learns that he must go on in his own development.
I:8499;2172;She's torn between two men, her husband and her old lover.
I:8499;2173;When they have scenes alone, he speaks of his love for her and she vows to stay by his side.
I:8499;2174;It sounds like they've been through a lot together and are truly attached.
I:8499;2175;She should be truly romantically involved with both men, not merely """"married"""" to Henried, but shown to be in an intimate relationship with him."""
2176;Paul Henried is very likeable as Victor, but his character this way is constructed to be a hero without sufficient human roots.
2177;His greatest love capacity seems to be an altruistic one.
2178;Ilse's attraction to Rick is that with him, she's paramount while with Victor she places second to his love for the cause.
2179;It would be interesting to explore what that would mean to her, that the war is robbing her of a fulfilling romantic love with both men.
2180;"Well, the acting in ""Casablanca"" is first rate all the way."
2181;I've always believed Warner Bros to have had the superior stable to MGM, and this movie proves that point admirably.
2182;"It stands with ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" as having the best ensemble performance in Hollywood."
2183;Of course, appearing in both movies is one of my very favorite actors, Claude Rains.
2184;I just saw the movie last night on a pier in NYC, and his scenes consistently drew the most laughs and applause.
2185;It's the role of a lifetime, and he does all he can with it.
2186;"Peter Lorre is wonderful in his early scenes with Bogart as the smarmy insecure Ugarte
I:8499;2187;That scene in the Paris bar, when she brushes her hand against Bogart's cheek is pure movie magic.
I:8499;2188;like just about everybody, I love """"Casablanca"""" as one of Hollywood's very best achievements"
2189;It's so easy to find the very best old, new and in between movies on Amazon.
2190;And at a very reasonable price.
2191;But Amazon makes it so easy and comfortable and competitive, how can I resist!
2192;I love how subtle the characters are.
2193;Released in 1942, World War II was more than just the news of the day, and it was a timely backdrop for this story.
2194;More a love story than a war story, the two blend together perfectly.
2195;What you will get is a thoughtful, caring story about two people whose lives and loves were changed by events outside their control.
2196;The commentary is great, and so is the disc of extras.
2197;Sit back and enjoy the film.
2198;Casablanca is by far one of my favorite movies and I love it more the more I watch it.
2199;I just received the case about an hour ago and I can tell you that I am FURIOUS with this company.
2200;The characters in it are as fresh now as when I first saw it, and their struggles are just as meaningful.
2201;Every character has strong motivations, and is acted superbly.
2202;the black and white might be a drawback in other movies, but here the use of shadows is amazing.
2203;At least three sets of people worked on it, each adding in their own talents to make the romance real, the conversations an intellectual chess game, and the tensions high.
2204;It's an amazing film about responsibility and maturity in difficult conditions, and one I will gladly watch over and over again.
2205;a classic romance movie that everyone needs to see at least once!
2206;The story is daring and examines the difficult decisions in life, decisions we make for love and for integrity, and how sometimes the two seem to conflict.
2207;It's a story of what true love looks like.
2208;this is such a classic.
2209;all these express the love that you do not see.
2210;Talk, talk, talk is another complaint!
2211;The movie won an Oscar for best screenplay, it's all that talking you don't understand.
2212;What surprises him is who this man brings with him.
2213;It is the old flame who he loved and crumbled his defenses with her elegance and style.
2214;She is married to the famous speaker and writer and Rick is taken aback.
2215;The bazaar and exciting culture glimpsed with the set of Morroco.
2216;She is so feminine and respectable to me.
2217;I like the way she talks and how she comes across on film.
2218;I liked the drives that Rick and Ilsa took in France, their leisure and intimate togetherness in cafes.
2219;An elegant film all in all.
2220;A classic movie/story tastefully done that puts modern movies in the dirt.
2221;In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made.
2222;Every scene is packed with suspense, beauty and truly great writing.
2223;One of my all time favorites.
2224;Can watch it often and still get the feeling of a first time viewer.
2225;A classic love story that both men and women will enjoy viewing.
2226;Like all great stories, it is the vivid characters you remember.
2227;Rick, the cynic with a heart of gold.
2228;Ilsa, the sweet,loyal wife with a secret past and a difficult present.
2229;After you dry your tears at the end, you will feel more hopeful about what human beings are capable of at their best.
2230;popular big screen love story.
2231;Ingrid Bergman is mesmerizing though, she deserves 5 stars.
2232;An exotic setting during World War II is the backdrop for a complicated love story, European politics, and a complicated character played by Bogart.
2233;I have seen it several times and will watch it again: Play it again Sam .
2234;Bogart and Bergman seem to be alive and in person just a few feet away.
2235;A pleasure for anyone who can read.
2236;certainly one of the 10 best movies ever crafted.
2237;The actors really made the movie worth watching.
2238;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really great well.
2239;This was gotten for my Mom and she loves it, she loves all the older movies as I do.
2240;"Plus it was fun seeing the movie that all those memorable quotes came from: ""Here's looking at you kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""."
2241;This is one of the best movies ever made.
2242;Set during WWII, it tells the story of two star crossed lovers, negotiating Nazism, patriotic duty, secrets, love and friendship.
2243;Bogey at his best, Bergman is ethereal and the supporting cast is outstanding!
2244;one of the finest movies made.
2245;Watch this movie and see Bogart and Bergman at their finest.
2246;Great acting, Great casting, Great plot, Great music, Great scenery, Great lines, Great ending.
2247;and a great movie will always be great
2248;Humphrey Bogart (Rick) is a master of the outer cold/inner warmth style.
2249;Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa) glows in her authentic softness.
2250;in the end, Rick makes the best (right) decisions for the individuals involved, and because of this, their actions are also good for society.
2251;This movie really deserves five stars.
2252;theentire film is remarkable ageless.
2253;I'm of three minds on the subject of the greatest love story.
2254;It's either this remarkable film in which Rick (Bogart) sends Ilsa (Bergman) off for the greater cause, Gone With The Wind in which Scarlett O'Hara doesn't realize she loves Rhett until its too late, or Titanic in which Rose DeWitt Bukator carries the memory of Jack Dawson in her heart throughout a titanic lifetime.
2255;The dialogue is still some of the best written ever.
2256;But, visually, it's not quite as inspired, stunning or meaningful as its big.
2257;It's a beautiful triangle of great romance, great action, and great drama if you ask me.
2258;after so many years, Casablanca still looks great.
2259;hard fans should love all of the new extras in this set.
2260;(let me catch my breath).
2261;Casablanca may be the one leg that supports the other two best.
2262;As usual, Bogey is at his top performance in this one!
2263;Worth every cent it cost.
2264;A classic Bogart movie with some great one liners.
2265;One of the great movies!
2266;I have loved this film since I was young and have seen it many times.
2267;I know most of the lines and the shots of the movie.
2268;Robert Ebert does a beautiful job in commentary and should do them more often.
2269;Many of the extras are well worth watching.
2270;Claude Rains is great also.
2271;My favorite movie of all time!
2272;wise), directed by Michael Curtiz.
2273;I highly recommend to anyone who has not seen it before.
2274;I'm going to see it over and over, because it's one of those movies you'll never want to forget.
2275;There are a few movies that just get better with age.
2276;I could watch it again right now and still see new things.
2277;It is one of my all time favorite films.
2278;at this price, even without the extras it is worth every penny.
2279;"If there is one film to be marooned with
I:8499;2280;The casting was superb, the best of all time.
I:8499;2281;They were fleeding for their live and later got to be in this movie, so you can see the high moral spirit in this movie.
I:8499;2282;It not just a romance movie about love between two people.
I:8499;2283;It is a movie about social responsibilities, and greater love for the country, people and principle they fought for.
I:8499;2284;It is a great movie to see and learn and understand.
I:8499;2285;Though it was black and white movie, but the cinemaphotography was the best of its time.
I:8499;2286;Ingrid Bergman superb beauty and cherisma just made tough guy even like Humphrey Bogart melted.
I:8499;2287;Simply put, it's just beautiful!
I:8499;2288;time favorite films with two of my all.
I:8499;2289;I like good old movies.
I:8499;2290;Humphrey Bogart is one of the best actors all time and his role as Rick solidifies that statement.
I:8499;2291;Rick must choose between love or doing the right thing or helping himself and it plays out as a great movie and it deserves the acadamy award it won in 1943 as best picture besides guys how often do you get a chick flick you can watch with your girlfriend and still enjoy
I:8499;2292;This is singularly the most valuable film any woman deciding between romance and stability should watch.
I:8499;2293;I feel strongly Richard made the right choice for Isla, as it is in her best interest to stay with her husband even if another suitor catches her eye and is the love of her life.
I:8499;2294;I recommend all women watch this film if only to remind themselves the importance of duty, tradition, values, and family honor.
I:8499;2295;It was amazing when I first saw it in 2009 and it is even more amazing now.
I:8499;2296;This is one of the best all time movies!
I:8499;2297;I watch it about twice/year.
I:8499;2298;This is better than what is put out today as a love story.
I:8499;2299;To take but that example, the studied close.
I:8499;2300;up shots of Ingrid Bergman's face are simply breathtaking.
I:8499;2301;The sound is mastered perhaps a little low, but with the volume turned up sufficiently, proves clear and flawless.
I:8499;2302;the extras alone would already be worth the investment.
I:8499;2303;There are two interesting, complementary commentaries by film historian Rudy Behlmer and critic Roger Ebert.
I:8499;2304;In """"You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca"""" one gets a complete view of the production."""
2305;I can't count the number of times I have watched it and I enjoy it each time.
2306;Not only do the stars put on an excellent performance but, the plot is wonderful as well.
2307;This movie is probably the greatest film achivement ever created by man, and the romance between Bogart and Bergman will NEVER be matched.
2308;A film this great can never be missed by anybody, and it is a truly powerful, moving, and beautiful film and it still remains so.
2309;This film won richly deserved Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay (but why didn' t Humphrey Bogart win Best Actor?)
2310;It is one of the greatest multi.
2311;And Disc Two contains a huge amount of features.
2312;She says, Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
2313;"(He was born c. 1886
I:8499;2314;The only reason Bergman's character would call him """"boy"""" is pure, utter racism."""
2315;This is without a doubt the greatest piece of cinema ever.
2316;The characters and the story are so complex that every time I watch this movie, I discover something I missed the previous times.
2317;this movie proves that Humphrey Bogart was truly Hollywoods greatest leading man.
2318;Forever now with this beautful restoration of a classic.
2319;Ingrid Bergman is totally magnificent in her beauty on Blu.
2320;Perfect flick for those days when you're in the mood for a classic love story.
2321;Always something new to discover!
2322;it is crisp and fresh and just as good today as ever.
2323;not dated, incredibly well done.
2324;Bogart and Bergman belong together in this movie.
2325;a beautiful love story in a war torn Country.
2326;I bought this movie because I want to see more movies with Humprey Bogart.
2327;He is great, he is a great actor.
2328;I love this movie SO much.
2329;For such a seemingly small movie it has more scope than most epics, maybe because of its wonderful script, with lines that are now so iconic in our culture, all as the world was about to sink into the greatest, most tragic war we'd ever known.
2330;Everything about the film feels perfect.
2331;So nice to enjoy a movie over and over again!
2332;In my top three favorite movies of all time.
2333;The performances by everyone are outstanding.
2334;All the cast is great as well.
2335;We all know that CASABLANCA is a uniquely great film.
2336;now it is available in a restored edition that surpasses all expectations.
2337;The film fairly glows with a pearly sheen and the sound is superb.
2338;(After seeing it, you'll want more!)
2339;The supporting cast and the script are perfect.
2340;Citizen Kane may have a reputation of being called The Greatest Movie more often than Casablanca , and it is technically brilliant .
2341;but the characters of Casablanca visit my dreams often and vividly, and I never dream of Charles Foster Kane and his screen partners.
2342;bogart is perfectly tough and tender.
2343;Ingrid Bergman is perfectly beautiful and torn between her noble husband and the man she loved earlier in Paris.
2344;This is one of the classics everyone can watch together.
2345;liners that make you want to watch it again and again.
2346;Dramatic, dark brooding but sweet and sentimental Rick.
2347;My wife and I viewed this.
2348;It's a classic, and the sound track is excellent.
2349;A little bit of romance is good!
2350;I think it is one of my favorite movies of all time.
2351;Still a timely theme seventy years after its debut.
2352;If you are thinking about getting the disc you already know it's a great film.
2353;Interesting ride back into history, by the time when II World War was in it's peack, beautiful movie, romantic, great actors, musical , simply loved it!
2354;The characters do a wonderful job in promoting their worth.
2355;One of the best movies of all time.
2356;awesome story with memorable cast.
2357;Casablanca is one of the greatest movies ever made.
2358;I really enjoyed this movie and would watch it again.
2359;The film noir style is so intense.
2360;This is the most romantic, best movie ever made.
2361;Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are wonderful and give excellent performances, too.
2362;With some of the all time best lines.
2363;Great movie with a lot of symbolism/metaphor for America's entry into World War II.
2364;If you haven't seen this film already, you'll see where some of the great quotations, that you're already familiar with, came from.
2365;The video presentation is pretty great, I have to say.
2366;If you're looking for classic films that are given a proper treatment, I recommend Criterion and Studio Canal.
2367;i sincerely hope that WB offers a trade.
2368;Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more.
2369;The cinematography and the choreography are excellent.
2370;In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.
2371;just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette!
2372;Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed.
2373;meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating.
2374;"He still loves Ilsa
I:8499;2375;Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick?
I:8499;2376;have"""" movie with outstanding attention to detail"
2377;"I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it
I:8499;2378;This is one of my favorite movies that I've never gone out and bought, so having it available to stream via Prime is pretty clutch.
I:8499;2379;Casablanca is probably the best happy accident in the history of film (The Third Man in a close second).
I:8499;2380;This film should have been forgettable, but thanks to a wonderful cast, Curtiz's direction, and a script that has given popular culture some of the most enduring quotes of all time, Casablanca is a massive success.
I:8499;2381;What follows is a touching love triangle that climaxes in perhaps the most perfect 10 minutes in the history of movies.
I:8499;2382;Casablanca is a classic for the ages.
I:8499;2383;It has great character development which will draw you into the story and help you experience the desperation of escaping the Nazi occupied Europe in 1942.
I:8499;2384;Bogart gives a excellent performance as an American bar owner in Casablanca who's past comes back to haunt him as he unwillingly becomes involved in a freedom fighter's escape from the Nazi's.
I:8499;2385;Bergman also gives a strong performance as Bogart's former flame.
I:8499;2386;i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.
I:8499;2387;It has the drama, suspense, and plot twists to keep you on your toes.
I:8499;2388;Casablanca is truly one of the best love stories every filmed!
I:8499;2389;Set on the back drop of World War II, this movie is full of adventure, suspense, romance and passion!
I:8499;2390;Bogart and Bergman sizzle together on screen.
I:8499;2391;this motion picture has the ability to transform the audience into another world.
I:8499;2392;The acting is superb, the script is solid, and the musical soundtrack is magical.
I:8499;2393;As time goes by, moviegoers all over the world will always remember Casablanca as one of the few """"perfect"""" movies ever to be created."""
2394;Every detail in this rousing, yet melancholy story of love against the backdrop of WWII is mastered, from the stunning performances of the cast to the witty, oft.
2395;And, blending all these magical elements together, is the perfect bittersweet song that takes Rick and Ilsa back to their star.
2396;They're trying to escape to America, but the French Precinct, Captain Louis Reynaud (the incredible Claude Raines), won't give them Visas.
2397;the enduring popularity of Casablanca can be attributed to the love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Lazlo.
2398;It can be attributed to the sheer magic of an entire city of people desperately trying to get away from the Nazis in a time of chaos.
2399;Personally, I believe this movie survives from generation to generation because Rick himself represents the American people on a whole.
2400;His 'don't tread on me' attitude and reluctance to leap into the turmoil of war appeals to us and illustrates the attitude of Uncle Sam.
2401;Although we've seen Casablanca time and time again, there are always those who tear up at Rick's noble sacrifice.
2402;collared husband for her one true love, the tough.
2403;Casablanca is a worldwide appeal to every generation, and will be one of the few films to persevere, as time goes by.
2404;The greatest movie of my lifetime.
2405;If you watch it several times the humor in parts of it just keep popping out.
2406;This is such a classic tale of love, heroism and self denial.
2407;It is a wonderfully constructed story of love and a tribute to the golden age of fine acting when beauty wasn't measured by exposed skin or sleazy performance.
2408;"this is a must have classic, if not for the story, the performance, or the music, then for the love theme:""You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things applyAs time goes by, and when two lovers woo, they still say, ""I love you"", on that you can rely, no matter what the future brings"""
2409;I have always wanted a copy of Cassablanca and now I do!
2410;Now it is in my collection for good!
2411;As time goes by this movie gets better.
2412;It holds your attention with the story, the acting, the drama of a period in history and peoples lives.
2413;Casablanca is one of my favorite movies, and this edition is wonderful.
2414;I'm very pleased with this edition!
2415;We said the lines, cheered our heroes, hooted the villains, applauded at the end.
2416;Nothing that takes away from the film at all, and still much better than some of the imperfections you see watching a movie in the theaters near the end of its run.
2417;with the exception of the cropping, it's a good copy and I'm mostly happy with it.

2428;Casablanca is her favorite film.
2429;The extras are very good .
2430;it is one of those movies that now and then, you just have to watch again.
2431;thought by many to be the best film or at least the most popular film of all time it is indeed a wonderful movie replete with danger, intrigue and romance.

2433;weary eyes fill the screen with full star wattage.
2434;He is the commanding center around which all the other characters revolve.
2435;ingrid Bergman is compelling and beautiful in her anti Hollywood 40's glamour.
2436;She is so natural in the role of Ilsa that she draws you into the world of the film with her tender and desperate performance.
2437;When the camera holds her lovely face in full frame, is there a more beautiful face in the entire world?Dooley Wilson as Sam the piano player takes a thankless sidekick and fills him with humanity and warmth.
2438;the delicious Claude Raines sparkles with wit and chicanery in his role as the chief of Police Renault.
2439;It is pure joy to watch this, one of Hollywood's greatest character actors in his best.
2440;the biggest star of the film is the script by the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip.
2441;It is tight, razor sharp and witty.
2442;With Casablanca you get a perfect film script.
2443;the direction by veteran Michael Curtiz is among his best work.
2444;The music by Max Steiner is top.
2445;notch example of film music from the golden age.
2446;"The rousing songs are by M. k. Jerome and Jack Scholl, ""Knock On Wood""."
2447;It gets better with each visit.
2448;A classic for all time.
2449;It was the first time my wife had ever seen a complete Bogie movie and she loved it.
2450;This story is one of the greatest of filmlands romance movies.
2451;It has many of the most memorable lines ever said on screen and it has influenced everything that came later.
2452;"Of course the line 'play it again sam"" was never actually said in this movie but this movie has been played into the hearts of anyone who enjoys classic romance films."
2453;Plus A story of Bogart who came from a uppermiddleclass family and was a brilliant actor by any standards.
2454;"After all watching this movie for the first time is like 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as the character Rick would say."
2455;This is a very great copy of the movie.
2456;This is probably the best pure Hollywood film ever, yeah, but here's what I appreciate about it: Nazis.
2457;this is one of the few films I have seen in which the German soldiers of WWII are not portrayed as either one.
2458;It is a true classic.
2459;As relevant today as the time it was made.
2460;Rick doesn't have to order his band to accompany Laszlo in his rendition of Les Marsailles, but he unhesitatingly gives his permission, hinting that his long dormant idealism is still alive and well.
2461;It sets up his memorable sacrifice at the end of the film when he gives up the love of his life for the greater good.
2462;the audience, likewise, gains a much greater understanding of Ilsa from that scene.
2463;She may still love Rick, but when she gazes at Laszlo during the scene, it's clear that not only does she love him as well, she also believes in his cause and admires the passion and fervor he brings to his work and beliefs.
2464;laszlo suddenly becomes worthy of competing with Rick for Ilsa's affections.
2465;When he comes to his senses and not only gives Ilsa and Laszlo the letters, but gives up Ilsa as well, we know that it's the right decision.
2466;"heartedly fights Major Strasser's later order to shut down Rick's, saying lamely that ""everyone is having such a good time."""
2467;The scene switches the focus of the story from lost love to supporting the greater good.
2468;It's emotion rivals that of the final airport scene and is absolutely critical to Casablanca.
2469;It's so important to the story that I think that the film wouldn't have become the classic it is without it.
2470;in 1981, Harry Reasoner produced an excellent segment for 60 Minutes on Casablanca.
2471;I hope that those who dismiss the scene can go back and, with some deepened perspective, can understand both why the Les Marsailles scene is so important to Casablanca's greatness and what it tells us about what 1942 America's beliefs and feelings were.
2472;One of the best movies ever.
2473;Wish I could give it 6 stars.
2474;What can I say,One of the best scripts ever written, one of the best films ever made.
2475;Top 10Watch it and see for yourself.
2476;This is a must see whether for the fist time or the hundredth!
2477;Bogart choosing The needs of the many over the desires of the few defined the spirit of the day.
2478;The reality of WW11 adding to the suspense makes this the finest Hollywood motion picture of all time.
2479;one of the greatest romantic films of all time, great for everyone of all age.
2480;i recommend everyone to watch it and again and again.
2481;Some of the most famous actors of the time, in a film that is truly a Classic.
2482;Finally we have a serious 2 disc set with interesting material gathered for the true fan of this classic movie.
2483;This is the most perfectly cut movie ever made.
2484;There is an interesting commentary by Roger Ebert but incredibly he blunders during the Flashback as he can't correlate Ilsa's husband being discovered in a railroad car still alive with her strange behavior toward Rick in Le Belle Aurore !
2485;(He mentions this at least twice and perhaps a third time) We also get a good dose of the children of the stars and Lauren (bogey's real wife,well at least the last one)Bacall gives us a nice introduction.
2486;Good for advocates of this movie and if you have the time to delve into the special Disc it will be an interesting experience.
2487;No film is more timeless in this manner than Casablanca.
2488;from the opening titles, you realize that this film is exceptional.
2489;Combining the artistic talents of Bogey, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Haydn, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, etc., Casablanca is a movie by which all other movies are measured, yet fall short of in the final analysis.
2490;There's a reason that everyone loves Casablanca.
2491;It has every element of a great film: star.
2492;studded cast (Bogart, Bergman, Lorre, Henreid, Greenstreet, etc.), mystery, drama, romance.
2493;This edition features the original theatrical trailer and a great documentary following the movie narrated by Bergman's real daughter, Lauren Bacall.
2494;see for any and every generation!
2495;Humphrey Bogart did his best acting in this movie, IMHO, of course.
2496;I bought this so I can watch this classic along with my family (they don't speak English), but when I got I found it did not have subtitles, still I kept it for myself!
2497;I ordered it on Blu.
2498;Beautiful and oh what a story.
2499;Still the same English version with subtitle options.
2500;SO what, excellent price, just took a long time to get here.
2501;Simply the greatest movie ever made!
2502;Perfect blend of great acting,directing and writing make for an unforgettable movie experience.
2503;This is obviously a classic in every sense of the word.
2504;Other than this the movie is great.
2505;ray transfer is fantastic .
2506;Not a huge fan, but my husband loves it.
2507;This has everything: comedy, romance, bad guys, and cynical heroes all wrapped up with the wittiest dialogue and rapid.
2508;fire delivery ever written for screen by by Hollywood's best writers.
2509;It has wonderful A. list casting with Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman and the underestimated Humphrey Bogart in his first romantic role.
2510;Treat yourself and see this one.
2511;If you haven't seen CASABLANCA, you're in for a real treat.
2512;Not only is it a love story but it's a thriller set in Vichy France Casablanca with intrigue and broken hearts.
2513;some real twists and a great surprise ending.
2514;Hold on to this one and love it.
2515;It is simply the best!
2516;It's as simple as that.
2517;Amazing how many of the lines in this picture are part of our culture today.
2518;I'm not going to review the movie, suffice to say it's one of my favorites and a classic.
2519;There are plenty of good extras on this version, enough to keep almost any avid fan of the movie satisfied.
2520;What can you say about a classic.
2521;Ingrid Bergman is magnificent and Humphrey Bogart is heartbreaking but valiant in this romance.
2522;Considered the best movie ever by American Film Institute as well as by me.
2523;The perfect film to show why fighting the Nazi's is worth sacrificing anything, and everything.
2524;A great romance, a great buddy film, and a story to make you think about what is important in life.
2525;It's a vintage film and it's fun to see bogart in action!
2526;I recommend this to anyone who wants some nostalgia!!!
2527;Casablanca is a great love and action movie that give an idea about people who escaped from WWII to United States.
2528;This timeless movie is a must have for any movie buff who enjoys the classics!
2529;I am thrilled to have it as part of my collection!
2530;I watched this 30 years ago and thought it interesting and entertaining.
2531;I also realized the fast pace of this film is remarkable and seems very modern.
2532;Somebody was very efficient in the cutting room and must have had Less is More above the work table.
2533;Casablanca is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made.
2534;The acting is perfect, the story is perfect, the movie is all around perfect.
2535;The transfer is great, as is the audio, especially considering this disc is over a decade old.
2536;There's also a commentary by Roger Ebert and an introduction by Lauren Bacall.
2537;It's not good, but there are some old '50s ads included, which make it worth it.
2538;With that is Carrotblanca, a 1995 Looney Tunes homage that is even worse than the T. v. adaption, but it's inclusion is nevertheless interesting.
2539;Most think this film to be one of the best, myself included.
2540;Rick has two authentic travel visas.
2541;this is one of the great war movies, one of the great romance movies, one of the a films.
2542;Go watch it again and continue your beautiful friendship with the film.
2543;If the film works, it is because of those treasured individual moments, Sam(Dooley Wilson) playing As time goes by , the aching looks of love between Rick and Ilsa, the colorful local and the one and only Humphrey Bogart.You constantly hear professional critics such as Leonard Maltin above refering to Casablanca as one of the greatest films ever made, and they may genuinely believe that.
2544;Turn out the lights, forget the reviews and these films would still be stunning.
2545;The film is aesthetically enhanced by producing it in colour.
2546;If ever a movie was worthy of this kind of Deluxe Boxset Edition , this is it !
2547;Perfect movie , great extras and a poster , some coasters and a nice Commemorative Book .
2548;One of my all time favorite films.
2549;This film has it all, drama, melodrama, comedy, political intrigue and even a few musical numbers.
2550;Bogart and Bergman have incredible chemistry and their performances draw you into the story like few other actors can.
2551;Casablanca has one of the greatest love stories ever told.
2552;I can watch this movie over and over again and never tire of the detailed nuances that define this classic.
2553;Great script, charismatic actors in all the roles, amid a slice of World War II romanticism.
2554;The film is listed as one of the top 5 greatest American movies of all time.
2555;This will always be one of the greatest movies of all time with a stellar performance by Humphrey Bogart and the very beautiful Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid and Claude Raines.
2556;A drama filled with suspense, political intrigue, love and romance, it will always be a must see for the entire family.
2557;This is when Hollywood was Hollywood and actors really knew how to act and make us feel that we were watching true life experiences happening right on that silver screen.
2558;The subject pretty much says it.
2559;And a working 110v outlet.
2560;This movie is just tops for romantics.
2561;It is so basic and pure in its portrayal of heroism, friendship, loyalty, love.
2562;the packaging was fine, and Amazon delivered it as promised and on time.
2563;But I finally broke down, and to see it is to love it.
2564;It is beautifully written, skillfully shot and tenderly acted.
2565;A great example of what American film was and should be.
2566;I remedied that situation and enjoyed the movie!
2567;A lovely enhanced version of a film classic.
2568;It's an easy 5 star classic film.
2569;This is one of my favorites.
2570;time classic will never age.
2571;You can use 1,000 words to describe Casablanca but it all comes down to superb acting from the lead actors to the bit players, outstanding writing from the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch, a great score from Max Steiner and direction from Michael Curtiz that moves a 1.
2572;The writing and dialog are the best.
2573;Classic, best ever romantic movie!
2574;watch it IMMEDIATELY if you don't!
2575;It is a classic still and worth having a any collection.
2576;Another great movie that you had for me to order!
2577;I hope you keep having these great movies.
2578;"The movie""Casablanca"" was 103 minutes of some of the best classic film ever recorded."
2579;It's helped to open my eyes to the world of the black and white classic movie.
2580;the awards for best director (Michael Curtiz), best actor (Humphrey Bogart),and best supporting actor (Claude Rains) were all well deserved.
2581;Ingrid Bergman also did a fabulous job in the part of Bogart's ex.
2582;i find it to be interesting that this movie would take a controversial situation, such as the German occupancy of France, and apply it to a movie based on a love triangle, while still managing to keep the entire thing believable.
2583;"memorable scenes filled with memorable lines, like ""Here's looking at you, kid."""
2584;Help to make this movie.
2585;i found this movie to be well done.
2586;It was believable, but with a twist.
2587;"Much like a nice cold glass of iced tea with a twist of lemon
I:8499;2588;in good condition and it worked fine.
I:8499;2589;What came out is a great story about finding love in troubling times"
2590;Casablanca is a love story for the ages.
2591;An underrated job is given by Paul Henreid, the essential third corner to the love triangle.
2592;So, despite the lack of explosions and Leonardo DiCaprio, you must see the true gem that is 'Casablanca'!
2593;but this exquisite blend of greed, passion, intrigue and idealism is one of the best dramas ever to emerge from a Hollywood lot.
2594;The script is so good that parts of it have become everyday catch phrases.
2595;They are in a class all their own.
2596;I find it amazing that the stars did not believe they were making that good of a film.
2597;I don`t want to explain you any part of this story, just see it for yourself.
2598;But, I want to ask you one question .
2599;, or This is a begining of a beautiful friendship.
2600;they are from Casablanca, probably the best Hollywood romance ever and the film you will not forget.
2601;I loved his character in this classic movie.
2602;It's just a movie but I tell you, the way it all happened .
2603;you HAVE to watch this!
2604;This is an old friend and I never tire of watching it.
2605;I also enjoy exposing younger associates to this one, for some, it is the first B&W film they have ever seen.
2606;In spite of the fact that Casablanca is enormously popular, which sets it up for criticism, it really is a great movie.
2607;This is the ultimate film .
2608;storyline, performances, direction, characterization, plot, cinematography, and of course, the best ending of all time.
2609;He may have been thinking of the growing box.
2610;With that recognition, he should smile once in a while.
2611;For any classical movie fan, this is a must own!
2612;Victor is being pursued by the Germans who have a strong influence over the French authorities in Morrocco and who will be happy to see him stopped.
2613;It has just the right mix of mystery, intrigue, romance and humour with a few memorable songs thrown in for good measure.
2614;Was a request from a friend, haven't seen it in a long time, enjoyed revisiting it!
2615;Fabulous movie, incredible actors, unbelievably great movie.
2616;This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
2617;Make some popcorn sit back and enjoy.
2618;What more can be said about Casablanca, the witty, stylish, sweeping romance?
2619;Bogie is Rick, a classy, hard.
2620;The supporting cast is marvelous: Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt .
2621;satan's got a real racket.
2622;It is a true classic, in the storytelling, the cinematography, and the acting.
2623;is, in one sentence, to completely misunderstand what the movies are all about, and have been since their inception.
2624;"Of course it's a dramatic love story, one of 50 made that year, but it's not JUST that
I:8499;2625;It's got every ingredient that makes a great film great.
I:8499;2626;menacing Nazis, threatening and easy to hate, a corrupt official (and practically everyone in the movie is),Ingrid Bergman at her most beautiful and giving an excellent heartfelt performance.
I:8499;2627;Faithful piano player Sam, Ric's only friend.
I:8499;2628;edited and easy to follow.
I:8499;2629;including the passionate singing of The Marsailles , a seminal moment.
I:8499;2630;Having a daughter in college minoring in History and taking French prompted me to focus on this extraordinary movie that triangulates, greed, love, patriotism, history and culture within the framework of a brilliant script and extraordinary acting within a World War II setting and historical correlation.
I:8499;2631;the opportunity to consider the meaning of Casablanca at this age of my life caused me to reexamine the characters beyond the memorable lines in the movie toward the thematic conclusion of transcending selfishness over a profound purpose for humanity.
I:8499;2632;From an educational perspective, I posit that Casablanca exudes the need to correlate the movie's great acting, content, context and time in history with the idea of honor and real patriotism.
I:8499;2633;, the moment when all men and women must choose the greater good over the selfish desires of the heart.
I:8499;2634;the classic lines in the movie, namely here's looking at you kid, can be a metaphor for all of us who struggle with making the decision to give up our desires for the notion of the greater good for our youth to believe that we stand for something greater than ourselves (they are looking at us!)
I:8499;2635;Sometimes, we give into the needs of those who are knowingly using our heart to advance their cause and can use our love, loyalty, core values or response to a person to seek our aid, support, skills or assets at our personal expense or beliefs.
I:8499;2636;At this stage and age of life, viewing Casablanca evokes the centrifugal feature of head with heart or head reshaping or refining the essence of what causes the heart to beat.
I:8499;2637;for educators, each time the nature of our work causes us to believe that we need to accept mistreatment as professionals to advance educational opportunity, we can truly look at the products of our educational efforts and really say: take these lessons and use them to advance civilization.
I:8499;2638;Hence, for educators, especially those teachers of children, Bogart's classic line is a metaphor for our work each day we teach: Here's looking at you kid!
I:8499;2639;Technically the picture streamed clearly and the sound flawless.
I:8499;2640;And thank goodness they didn't kill the movie by colorizing it.
I:8499;2641;The nuances of black and white comes across so well I can't imagine the horror of changing it into color.
I:8499;2642;It is a classic movie of: a love story, redemption, and patriotism, and with a fabulous theme song.
I:8499;2643;Bogart is perfect as the hard on outside and soft on the inside hero.
I:8499;2644;Bergman is lovely as the vulnerable former love.
I:8499;2645;And Dooley Wilson is perfect.
I:8499;2646;The supporting cast may be one of the best.
I:8499;2647;One of the top 10 movies of all time.
I:8499;2648;Bogart is at the top of his game"
2649;The Marsellaise scene still gives me goosebumps, and I've seen this movie too many times to count.
2650;proof: so stirring and entertaining that even its myriad implausibilities (you'll never see a swankier set of war refugees in your life) add somehow to its charm.
2651;bound elements of the studio system without even trying.
2652;and produces an happy and effervescent concotion.
2653;The transfer is excellent and the commentaries are better than average (plus you get a soundtrack extra featuring Dooley Wilson doing several takes of the songs).
2654;After watching the film and all the assorted supplements, you'll get a strong sense of why Casablanca was so unique .
2655;Great classic move, with some great classic lines.
2656;Enjoyed the black and white as well.
2657;the entire world knows about it.
2658;So I'll make this short and to the point.
2659;That's two stars right there.2.
2660;Some of the best writing Hollywood (we called it Hollywood in those days instead of Harletwood) ever produced.
2661;Some of the best music ever mastered for a movie.
2662;When you consider the idea is actually a simple love triangle during World War Two how could it have attained such greatness.
2663;I could go on and on about this movie, take it apart and tell about how great the writing, and acting are, but have you seen how many reviews this thing has?
2664;Moving along, that's a star right there, a really low end idea that came out 'great'.
2665;It's such a good thing Hollywood had a long list of actors to choose from.
2666;i'm watching it again as I write this, that darn French Captain kind.
2667;You must listen to each word, study their body language, watch their eyes as you watch the movie.
2668;so there it is, rated as the second greatest movie ever made, and not one s. t, not one cuss or swear word, not one exploding head and almost no special effects.
2669;The Bottom Line:A deserved classic that will appeal to even the most black.
2670;hearted cynic, Casablanca succeeds due to an emphasis on characters set against a fascinating backdrop.
2671;I have been looking for this movie and was so excited that i found it on Amazon!
2672;Loved the story loved the music!
2673;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
2674;So many lines from this movie BECAME cliches because they were so great and so memorable in this film.
2675;The plot, the acting, still excellent.
2676;I wonderful movie standing the test of time.
2677;This one is a classic and you can watch it over and over again.
2678;Seriously, this is a great film and they just don't make them like this anymore.
2679;Casablanca is a classic but NOT because the story is so wonderful.
2680;pleaser and a classic that's worth watching.
2681;Great box set,Lots of pictures in the book, very nice coasters (one from Blue Parrot, one from Casablanca, one from Rick's Caf Am ricain and one from La Belle Aurore) a french version poster and three discs.
2682;This is without discussion the best movie ever made and Boogie and Bergman continue to amaze because of their talent and unique film persona!!!
2683;"Wonderful photography
I:8499;2684;ok some of the lines are over the top but all in all a truly great movie.
I:8499;2685;Bergman is gorgeous and Bogart is Bogart as usual.
I:8499;2686;Such a great ending, yes?
I:8499;2687;The German deserved to be shot, well, you know, his character did.
I:8499;2688;And the line about a great friendship is classic.
I:8499;2689;So if you haven't see, see it .
I:8499;2690;See it but all means.
I:8499;2691;The sbsolute best """"Classic"""" film of all time."""
2692;bogart at his very best, Bergman was fabulous, Claude Raines terrific, Henreid wonderful and Conrad Veidt his most venemous.
2693;There is no better film!
2694;I just watched for the first time and it was great.
2695;Nice for a do nothing day when you curl up with a cup of coffee.
2696;I love this movie for sentimental reasons.
2697;Some of the best known lines come from this film.
2698;should watch it this year.
2699;It has a great story, told with a well.
2700;When one has a field of actors whose talents bring the screen all it needs to make a compelling, exciting and enduring movie, why clutter a movie with all that fluff?I cannot calculate the number of times I have watched this movie.
2701;I would love to watch this movie afresh every time.
2702;As a result, the way directors were able to engross the audiences in their films was by telling compelling stories and developing their characters with great depth and care.
2703;These movies also involved some of quickest, sharpest, wittiest dialogue ever committed to the big screen.
2704;Casablanca may be the pantheon of the 'Golden Era'.
2705;It is easily one of the most quoted movies in cinematic history and it has some the most memorable scenes.
2706;It evokes one of the greatest lines in cinematic history and sets in motion series of events involving intrigue, passion, and suspense.
2707;the wordplay between Bogart's Rick and any one of the other characters is true treat to behold.
2708;It is sharp and witty and seems so perfectly timed.
2709;Will it be the one of selfish interest or the one of greater good?
2710;The viewer never knows until the very end.
2711;Bergman's Ilsa is one of the most beautiful female characters in the history of film.
2712;Bergman's beauty would be just as captivating today as it was back in the 1940's.
2713;"Unlike today's films, which feel the need show too much, ""Casablanca"" uses subtlety to convey the emotion and passion."
2714;The threat of the German 'Gestapo' hanging over every action and every scene creates a tension, a fear, and a suspense that few movies can match.
2715;There is purpose in everything that happens.
2716;Casablanca has been termed by some to be the 'perfect film'.
2717;Casablanca, however, earns that praise and proves to be a timeless classic that is as moving today as it was in 1942.
2718;"To me, ""Casablanca"" is one of the most perfect examples of films from Hollywood's golden age."
2719;bound film that they don't make anymore.
2720;It's also got Humphrey Bogart, one of Hollywood's greatest stars in one of his signature roles.
2721;But thanks to sharp writing, directing, and acting it transcends this and becomes a universal story about the need to get off our behinds and combat evil.
2722;"among the memorable quotes:""Here's looking at you kid."""
2723;Louis, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
2724;I'm sure fans will be able to think of plenty more.
2725;sacrifice so noble, because it is so unexpected.
2726;"the ending of ""Casablanca"" has got to be one of the greatest, and most satisfying endings ever in a Hollywood film."
2727;Casablanca is a must for any lover of old films.
2728;One of the best Black and White movies ever made, if not the best.
2729;Superb collectables with a reasonable price.
2730;but this is a one of a kind collectable.
2731;As this is a limited edition the price will keep going up.
2732;It was easy to show it to our movie.
2733;There are so many awesome lines in this movie .
2734;Supporting cast is well done .
2735;get some popcorn, cuddle up with your honey and enjoy the movie!
2736;The best thing I can say is.
2737;It had many twists and turns, and the ending was just genius!
2738;Well shot, acted and written.
2739;A great one to add to any colllection.
2740;Thought it was interesting to watch a moving depicting real time events.)
2741;i would rate this movie excellent movie and my (first time) on Prime experience very good.
2742;It's a timeless story with great characters and enough plot twists to make you think !
2743;bogart and Bergman are terrific.
2744;claude Rains and Sydney Geenstreet are excellent.
2745;A great movie for all the family!
2746;Casablanca is the perfect movie, in the same way that some concert halls have perfect acoustics.
2747;In a nut shell I always liked Humphrey Bogarts acting and the excitement that his acting always brings to the movie scene
2748;Maybe 4.5, but definitely above I like it (4 stars).
2749;The patriotism of the film is well.
2750;and the foregoing of that love for a greater good.
2751;dozen excellent actors, some hep music, and the exotic locale (!)
2752;I bought the movie as a gift and it was a hit.
2753;the seller also had exceptional customer service.
2754;They made sure I received the movie, in the condition stated on Amazon, and they wanted to be sure the product worked.
2755;Even so I can clearly see that Director Michael Curtiz found many ways to tie the originally B track movie into hearts of and eventually the culture of Americans.
2756;I also feel like the movie is not targeted at my general demographic characteristics but it does a good job of letting us look into the attitudes that were prevalent in the 1940's.
2757;a good classic movie but not on the top of the stack.
2758;ray edition is on a par with the film elements.
2759;In fact, it is one of my best looking transfers, with a pristine and sharp picture, from beginning to end.
2760;A dramatic, moody tale of romance, intrigue, danger, and despair.
2761;Your heart is tugged by Bogart and Bergman, and even the ever.
2762;dramatic Peter Lorre makes a memorable scene or two.
2763;The actors are top notch!
2764;One of the best love stories on film ever.
2765;Rick really is a stand up guy who will stick his neck out for someone else.
2766;It was interesting to see how much Rick's character developed from the beginning of the film to the end.
2767;Isle's character is also very interesting, but I don't like that at the end of the movie she lets her complex female character be controlled by Rick's masculine character.
2768;She went from being really strong and intelligent, to letting man decide what she had to do with her life.
2769;3 Oscars,2 Legends Made,and 62 years later,Casblanca is still a flawless classic and is still a favorite for every generation.
2770;i can't begin to explain how amazing this movie is,but I'll just start with Ingrid Bergman and the great Humphrey Bogart.
2771;these two give the greatest of their careers and quite possibly have the best chemistry of all time.
2772;one can even sense real love for each other.
2773;this is simply a tale of two separated lovers meeting again,and much more.
2774;the supporting cast does many great performances as well(Captain Renault is a favorite among people I know),and the screenplay contains more legendary quotes than all the presidents and Gone With The Wind combined.
2775;He and Bergman met and loved earlier, and now she turns up with her husband, who wants help escaping from the country.
2776;The plot thickens and gets murkier and deeper .
2777;One of his best roles.
2778;In fact, one of the best roles ever played by any of the actors.
2779;There are not that many romantic movies that men love, but this is the great exception.
2780;'Casablanca' is a gripping thriller that never lets the pace flag.
2781;Bergman looks beautiful and elegant.
2782;The script is clever and sharp with umpteen memorable lines.
2783;Throw in Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, and you have the recipe for a perfect film.
2784;in 'Casablanca' the protagonists live out their moral dilemmas before us with a conviction that is rare in the cinema.
2785;Bogart looks genuinely pained when Bergman walks in.
2786;When Bergman has to choose between Bogart and Paul Henreid, you really believe her heart is about to break in two.
2787;This is acting at its best.
2788;Even Henreid manages to look noble and heroic as a wartime resistance leader without looking insufferable.
2789;Couple that with a script that not only involves us emotionally in their tangled moral dilemmas, but also resolves these dilemmas beautifully, and you have a recipe for a classic movie.
2790;the director Michael Curtiz deserves credit for skilfully bringing everything together.
2791;Frame by frame, this film's brilliance is a tribute to his professionalism.
2792;"One of the greatest American movies of all time, with a beautifully restored print, an interesting commentary track by Roger Ebert, some ""deleted scenes"" and other little extras ."
2793;This movie should be a required piece of literature, for college sophomores and above.
2794;Only one out of 12.15 viewings, can I summon the internal courage to let Ilse leave with her husband.
2795;I know the the ethical arguments, favor letting her leave with her husband, but my romantic instincts are to keep her.
2796;I think it is one of the most gripping, and thought provoking movies ever made.
2797;The best movie ever made!!!
2798;The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman cant be beat.
2799;One of the few movies I watch over and over.
2800;I found this movie engaging,considering it is nearly 65 years old.
2801;the black and white of the film also works well for the genre.

2804;the bonus features are also not too bad,keeping you informed of the main actors in some of the movies of that era.
2805;Dated, sure, but still the best movie ever.
2806;"are charmingly so
I:8499;2807;A great box set which gives good value for money.
I:8499;2808;Not to mention one of the great old time movies.
I:8499;2809;casablanca surprised me in its intensity and sensativity.
I:8499;2810;the plot and sub plot works well together.
I:8499;2811;all I can say is I liked it .
I:8499;2812;CASABLANCA is the favorite movie of many fans for good reasons.
I:8499;2813;The combination of superior direction, acting, cinematography and a superb screenplay doesn't come together in one package too often.
I:8499;2814;bogart, Bergman and Paul Henreid work together beautifully.
I:8499;2815;The supporting cast is incredibly deep in talent.
I:8499;2816;few movies leave us with so many memorable lines such as """"We'll always have Paris"""" or """"Round up the usual suspects"""" or """"Here's looking at you ."""
2817;for the record the Academy Awards were for best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay (Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch).
2818;the Academy Award nominations were for best actor (Humphrey Bogart), best supporting actor (Claude Rains) and best cinematography (Arthur Edeson).
2819;It's the old classic, Bergman and Bogart at their best in a story we, who survived those times, can all relate to.
2820;But this classic, set in Casablanca in the last few days before the raid on Pearl Harbor and the German declaration of war brought the country into the global war, has everything.
2821;This movie is a true classic!
2822;Even though it's in black and white, it's still one of the best films of all time.
2823;Fabulous acting highlights the struggles of an important part of history with memorable lines and music.
2824;This is a must see movie for any serious movie fan.
2825;depth articles in the past few issues of Widescreen Review that detail the first widescreen films and their release dates.
2826;more classic lines than any movie.
2827;Of course, it's got some great lines like 'Here's looking at you kid' (I use that one all the time) and 'Play it again, Sam.'
2828;The World War Two subplot also kind gets you, like some kind of turf war between rival gangs, the Nazis and the French.
2829;But what gives me the jip is the fact that Humphy lets that sweet kid go off on a plane trip into the fog with some dorky freedom fighter.
2830;Fantastic Edition for a fantastic Movie!
2831;Although the movie does not necessarily plumb the issues fully, it has a great range of human experience .
2832;love gained and lost, friendship, and living with (or without) principles.
2833;The story has that compelling feeling that nothing extra is in the film.
2834;One aspect I noticed with this most recent viewing is the interesting subtleties.
2835;For example, the love develops between the two leads, Bogart and Bergman, takes place in Paris without them truly knowing each other.
2836;The film is full of the messiness of every day life and real relationships and world politics, with ambiguity and yet ultimately a sense that something has been accomplished, that some clarity has appeared.
2837;Casablanca is one of the most beloved films in movie history.
2838;It is a timeless classic that has crossed over from mere entertainment into pure Americana.
2839;This sets up a love triangle that famously concludes on the airstrip.
2840;Director Michael Curtiz won the 1943 Best Director Oscar for his work and the film won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as writers Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch picking up the Oscar for Best Screenplay for one of the most memorable screenplays of all time.
2841;I enjoyed it and am now in love with Humphrey myself.
2842;Great story of love, filled WW II history.
2843;A true classic and worth watching.
2844;This is one of the all time classics.
2845;Love this movie finally own it.
2846;The greatest movie ever made.
2847;What a great movie, star crossed lovers, WWII looming in the background, Nazis vying for power.
2848;This is a timeless story, if you have never watched it, give it a try.
2849;See if they really said, play it again, Sam!
2850;I could watch it every day, war, intrigue, romance and some of the best lines ever.
2851;An all time classic love story.
2852;the acting was good, tight storytelling.
2853;Casablanca is one of the few great movies that is made by, for, and about its own generation, in this instance the generation that came of age between the two World Wars and who can fairly call World War Two its defining moment.
2854;The movie indeed comprises a rather broad array of levels, some profound, some superficial, some cinematic, some dramatic, some thematic, and a host of others, all in one or another way about the human condition.
2855;the best essay I know of about Casablanca is by Tim Dirks at filmsite.
2856;org, who retells the entire film while including his wonderful insights.
2857;Each time the movie is breathtaking, always achieving an unachievable perfection, and still always presenting something I hadn't noticed or realized before.
2858;The plot is full of iconic characters, but you can't help but fall in love with these people and this movie.
2859;She is stong and vunerable at the same time.
2860;The supporting cast is memorable.
2861;This film is, and always will be a CLASSIC!
2862;Everything about this movie is excellent.
2863;this film has been wonderfully restored.
2864;The picture is crisp and clean and in perfect focus.
2865;What an enjoyment to watch such a great classic in pristine condition.
2866;This is the best movie period.
2867;The actors the script, the suspense carries well after so many years.
2868;I think that Casablanca was Humphrey Bogart's best movie.
2869;I enjoy watching it every so often.
2870;It is a great movie.
2871;Classic movie with a great story line.
2872;We had to turn on the CC, but all in all a fun, clean movie.
2873;This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
2874;one of my favorites, regardless of my preference for Lauren Bacall, Ingrid does an amazing job!
2875;A fantastic movie set in WWII, major stars, Bergman and Bogart with a huge list of supporting actors.
2876;The turn of the century produced a lot of lists including Best Movies .
2877;I noted that Casablanca ranked right up there with the best American movies of all.
2878;I certainly have in in my top.
2879;ten because it is one of those classics where everything came together just right.
2880;The acting is superb and there is a great chemistry between the main characters.
2881;line was exciting, believable, and emotional.
2882;The audience is drawn into the emotion and no one but the hardest boiled eggs among us gets away without a heart.
2883;The directing is great, the music is memorable, the supporting actors terrific.
2884;The casino setting is an excellent metaphor for the twists of fate that have affected so many in this corner of the world.
2885;This mixture of romance and adventure makes Casablanca a movie for everyone.
2886;That is why Casablanca is so loved even after all these years.
2887;It works so well because everything came together just right.
2888;I recommend that you watch it with your spouse or significant other.
2889;Bogart in his most celebrated role as the suave and charismatic Rick, along with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman.
2890;One of the films that makes Hollywood great!
2891;Highly reccomended to anyone and everyone.
2892;I watch this one once a year.
2893;Instead, it gives us some of the snappiest dialogue of American Cinema and the most romantic love story.
2894;She scoots when her husband Laslo, the resistance hero is found to be alive.
2895;Every one of them gives the performance of their life.
2896;This is a tough one for the women in the audience.
2897;He's a brave and kind man.
2898;The package came to me in the indicated term.
2899;As an old guy, I like it.
2900;One of the best pictures ever.
2901;This boxed set comes with a picture perfect Blu.
2902;it's considered one of the best films of all time.
2903;but when you take into account the limitations of film and acting back in the golden age of Hollywood it's easy to see why this film is one of the top five on most critics' lists.
2904;I did love the behind.
2905;ray edition of Casablanca will be wonderful if you enjoy lots of postcards, booklets, and a fancy box.
2906;But the clarity of picture and sound are worth the hefty price, especially for collectors or people who want to know lots of minute detail about the history of the movie.
2907;Will make a wonderful holiday gift.
2908;Best movie ever and I am not a particular fan of Bogarde or Bergman, but the combination of setting, story other characters and acting is near perfect.
2909;This is the best movie ever made.
2910;And you know it all by heart.
2911;Best performances by Bogey and Bergman.
2912;If you haven't seen it, give it a whirl!
2913;When I was 14 years along in life love, before my perilous journey through both began, my mother decided that I was adult enough to appreciate staying up late to learn the joys of real great movie.
2914;Of course, back in those days , you could only find a masterpiece of cinema from the Golden age on in the wee hours.
2915;m. Mitchell, to name a few.
2916;I have, forever, loved planes, my favorite plane is the B.17.
2917;An excellent way to do that would be to make them watch Bogie as he walks into Rick's w/ that white dinner jacket an attitude we'll never forget.
2918;It is easy for us all to say we are patriotic, just watch Paul Heinreid have enough courage to lead the cafe in the most moving movie song I have ever seen.
2919;By the end of that emotionally charged scene, you can not help but be curious.
2920;a beautiful love story that just happens to be set in one of the most exciting atrocious times ever in our history.
2921;Story, Actors, Acting, Patriotism, Realism, Emotion, Sex, Violence, Music, great editing.
2922;More doors open up for the whole family to learn about each other if we just start somewhere.
2923;The lure of 'Casablanca' lies in its romance, intrigue and mystery.
2924;But those are common ingredients for many movies.
2925;What makes it a landmark film and a touchstone for so many is largely because of its romance.
2926;He is absolutely right about it.
2927;his words mirror some of my thoughts about this classic of a film.
2928;"Michael Curtiz did an excellent directorial job that ultimately earned him the ""Best Director"" award while brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, and Howard Koch won the ""Best Screenplay."""
2929;"Even though Bogart did not win the ""Best Actor"" in which he was nominated for, I admire his acting."
2930;I believe he was one of the most credible actors of all.
2931;time who can do justice to any role that he portrayed.
2932;He was such a great actor with intriguing yet magnetic personality.
2933;I admire his character that shows his patriotism and not to mention his kind understanding and undying love for his wife albeit her infidelity.
2934;although I've seen the film several times in the past, I still enjoy it from start to finish whenever I feel like watching it again.
2935;I still feel the very same emotions with each viewing.
2936;while the storyline is not exactly the best love story ever written because of its unexpected twist in the ending, it is absolutely one of the best films ever produced and one of my top five favorite classic films of all.
2937;The portrayal of the main characters, Rick and Ilsa, are impressively acted out to perfection.
2938;a. kind, poignant love story.
2939;"Even though Ilsa broke Rick's heart, he loved her so much that he once described her, ""She isn't just any woman."""
2940;"Another thing that made Casablanca"" appealing is the beautiful soundtrack courtesy of Max Steiner who wrote the music score."
2941;"He was described as ""the favorite composer of Warner Brothers and was famous for writing stunning scores, he's always on the cutting edge for all his scores."""
2942;"He was also nominated for ""Best Musical Scoring."""
2943;He should have won the award, his choice of music is impeccable.
2944;all the greatest songs from 1930s and early 1940s.
2945;"Henry Mancini, an outstanding composer/film scorer/arranger/conductor, once said that ""As Time Goes By"" is ""masterful and it is tied to the film so tightly."""
2946;Remember the following memorable scenes?
2947;These are the scenes that moved me the most, To me, they are the emotional highlights of the film.
2948;There is a sentimental and nostalgic touch in the way the song was rendered by Sam (Dooley Wilson).
2949;"ilsa: ""Some of the old songs, Sam."
2950;"ilsa: ""Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake."
2951;"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."
2952;Anyone who has loved and lost can feel for him and can empathize with him.
2953;Sam: Oh, just a little something on my own.
2954;"disc Special Edition is worthy to any ""Casablanca"" fan and it is also an ideal gift item as well."
2955;Casablanca is truly a timeless beauty and definitely a keeper!
2956;When I do, I look to the classics and Casablanca fits the bill with spades.
2957;I love old war based espionage movies, and although Casablanca definitely leans more to the romantic side, it's storyline ties to the war is undeniable.
2958;A great classic with Bogart at his best!
2959;It was intriguing and the love story was freshing and a nice touch.
2960;One of the rare films that can be watched and enjoyed repeatedly.
2961;I think that the previous sentence sums it up quite nicely.
2962;Casablanca is a timeless classic.
2963;One of my favorite films and masterpiece.
2964;This is a film made for the great annals of film history.
2965;It is part drama, part romance both shaken and stirred, in the perfect combination, served on the rocks.
2966;I won't say anymore, except this: If you see only one more film in your entire life, see this one and call it at that.
2967;obviously the film is a classic and there is nothing I can say about that hasn't already been said in the 70 years since this film was made.
2968;Okay, first off, I love Bogey, He is one of my favorite actors.
2969;This is a movie that every American must see.
2970;Hard to say if it is the best movie of all time, but truly an outstanding movie.
2971;Some of the most memorable lines in movie history.
2972;A must for any movie buff.
2973;In my estimation (and I am a huge movie fan, both old and new), this is the perfect result of what hard work and dedication will bring to the screen.
2974;I have seen this well over forty times in my life and I hope to see this at least a few times more before they call me to that great balcony in the sky (and if you get showered with popcorn from above, that me!)
2975;Make your teenage kids see it, make yourselves see it.
2976;Another great old classic had to add it to my collection.
2977;Winner of 3 academy awards including best picture.
2978;Include some of the great actors and actress and I am good to go.
2979;"Best film ever
I:8499;2980;This classic, of course, was a repeat viewing.
I:8499;2981;I viewed this through a Hulu connection to Amazon on a 10.
I:8499;2982;Play it again Sam, if you can play it for her you can play it for me.

I:8499;2986;Bogart's best performance, his long awaited role in a romantic.
I:8499;2987;This is one classic you can view again and again.
I:8499;2988;The added technology makes this almost a new movie!
I:8499;2989;Fine detail and a wonderful sound track make this an even better film this time around.
I:8499;2990;The creative minds of cinematographers can leave you with a 3.
I:8499;2991;d impression, as the old blur is gone and is right up front in detail.
I:8499;2992;Mostly what one might refer to as film noir and there's nothing wrong with that it just carries along like a wonderful river of acting should carry a film!
I:8499;2993;Please also make time for the extras , as they make a good story on their own.
I:8499;2994;its in most peoples top 10 list of all time classics and the volumes of extra features and commentaries are for the most part re.
I:8499;2995;Michael Curtiz is without a doubt one of the greatest directors ever with an early run of classics with Errol Flynn (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Robin Hood, The Charge of the light Brigade and more) to Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy , Mildred Pierce and even White Christmas just for starters in his resume and it great to have something on him finally.
I:8499;2996;ray is noticeably improved and I'm not even a guy with a massively expensive home theater system and I was blown away by the rich blacks and overall just the brilliant and staggeringly beautiful black and white film I was enjoying.
I:8499;2997;but if you are a film fan and a fan of glorious Black and White with lovely play between shadows and light.
I:8499;2998;Its the same first disc as this set with the two new documentaries.
I:8499;2999;For fans of this movie, this is a must have product.
I:8499;3000;The movie is classic and timeless and plenty has been written so no need for further discussion there.

I:8499;3002;And being laid up in the hospital.
I:8499;3003;It is the best movie that I watched.
I:8499;3004;If you would like to have a good copy with a nice souvenirs this product brings you a beautiful poster and other souvenirs.
I:8499;3005;Everything that worked up to now, the sets, the lighting, the camera work, the shadows, the acting (especially the ecsquisite ham on wry of Claude Rains), the atmosphere, the witty dialogue, the close.
I:8499;3006;ups of Bogey And Bergman"
3007;From beginning to end a beautiful movie.
3008;This is one of the best if not THE best movie of all time.
3009;A romance set in the backdrop of the biggest war in history.
3010;The colorful cast combined with a great story line and superb lighting make this the finest love story of the 20th century.
3011;"This is one of those movies that has something for everyone
I:8499;3012;I would rate this tied for the best movie of all time with Citizen Kane, and Absolutely the best romance movie of all time.
I:8499;3013;If you are looking for good old fashioned entertainment, Casablanca is one of the best.
I:8499;3014;Family friendly, this Academy Award winning move (Best Picture)provides both a smooth story line and well scored sound track.
I:8499;3015;Casablanca is a must for any film lover.
I:8499;3016;Dooley Wilson sings a number of great songs as """"Sam""""."""
3017;The movie is full of charactor actors who in reality had escaped from Hilter's/Musselini's Europe with their lives.
3018;It is hard to know beforehand what are the perfect ingredients to make a movie live forever, but it is easy to see it when they all coalesce before one's eyes.
3019;Casablanca, more than almost any movie, has earned the right to live on and on and deserves to be called a classic.
3020;It has one of the finest casts ever assembled for any movie from the starring roles of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman to the supporting players such as Peter Lorre, Syndey Greenstreet, and the incomparable Claude Rains.
3021;It is a joy to watch every time and a must for any video collection.
3022;A perfect film created when all the ingredients of movie making turned to magic and now can live forever.
3023;I bought this Movie as a gift for my husband, it is his fav!!
3024;I was very impressed by how fast it got here and how simple the purchasing was!
3025;It is always voted near the top as one of the best movies ever.
3026;Great flick with a great story line and some comedy thrown in.
3027;It's one of those rare films that you can't see too often.
3028;Each viewing bring a further appreciation of it.
3029;It is Bogart at his best, Bergman at her most sublime and a cast of character actors with a personal, emotional attachment to the theme of the movie.
3030;It's no surprise that it has become one of the cinema's most beloved films.
3031;Its history is as fascinating as the film itself and the added features enrich a person's appreciation of the accomplishment of the film.
3032;The creative folk who make the film are every bit as interesting as the film they created.
3033;Probably the best movie ever mad.
3034;Everything needed in a movie, intrigue, suspense, love, sex, bribery, all sorts interesting pieces.
3035;"Who cares about the extra documentary features, or the coasters, poster and all the ""what."
3036;"not"" that comes with this handsomely designed box set."
3037;This is hands down one of the best films ever made.
3038;It holds up to the test of time no matter what form it is in.
3039;This, of course, is an absolute classic.
3040;I've watched it many times and enjoy it a great deal.
3041;The detail is positively amazing.
3042;This move must never be colorized, but the detail enhancement makes me love it even more.
3043;A great movie, a great director, magnificent actors, and a delightful story.
3044;one of the top 100 movies of all time.
3045;now available on Blu Ray great video and audio.
3046;No issues with this Movie and the move to Blu Ray and preservation is something that is Classic.
3047;the extra's are nice to have.
3048;Bought this a while ago and recently sat down to enjoy it.
3049;This is the ultimate movie ever made and it does get better with each viewing.
3050;Watching it four or five times a year always evokes a freshness in me to the plot and the character development is always remarkable.
3051;To think that this movie was never really intended to be a classic, yet has become one is in itself remarkable.
3052;Now, go watch it again!
3053;If you're still here, thanks for listening.
3054;In case you haven't figured it out, it's my favorite movie.
3055;It's my mother's favorite movie.
3056;It's my wife's favorite movie.
3057;It's my best friend's favorite movie.
3058;Go watch it with someone you love .
3059;even better, go watch it with someone you'd like to love you.
3060;I think the acting by Bogart and Bergman is superior.
3061;I am 82yrs old and grew up with these outstanding actors and actresses.
3062;This addition provides a commentary on the making of the film that provides great insights, including how the film, which was filmed in Hollywood was made to appear as if it was filmed in Casablanca.
3063;Bogart is one of perhaps five of my favorite actors.
3064;This is truly a classic.
3065;I have now seen this about seven or eight times, but, if anything, I enjoy it more upon repeated viewings rather than less.
3066;the movie remains enjoyable for a host of reasons.
3067;The cast is as good an any in the history of film, not just the leads, but a host of minor characters.
3068;In fact, knowing that many of the cast members had been forced to flee Europe because of the spread of Fascism, including those portraying Nazis, gives the movie especial power.
3069;There are a good fifteen or sixteen memorable characters, giving this film an unusual depth.
3070;Nonetheless, the film is carried not by the supporting characters, but by the tremendous performances by the leads, most notably Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains (interestingly, the latter two would later appear in one of Hitchcock's greatest films, NOTORIOUS).
3071;there are dozens of superb moments in the film similar to this.
3072;Although the script was famously a complete mess, with the writers literally working on it as they were filming, nearly every line is a masterpiece.
3073;Great plot overall, great dialog, and great scenes.
3074;It may have been a mess at the time, but the result is sheer genius.
3075;but at the heart of the film is the story of a great love, in which two people set aside their great love for one another, the love of a lifetime, for causes bigger than themselves.
3076;The film is the ultimate paean to self.
3077;Best of all, it is a phenomenal film, and rightfully celebrated as one of the greatest ever made.
3078;Nonetheless, the film remains immensely popular among critics and film historians as well as so. called movie buffs.
3079;It received an Academy Award as best film in 1943, as did Michael Curtiz for directing it.
3080;Bogart and Bergman are joined by an especially strong supporting cast (notably Greenstreet, Henreid, Lorre, Rains, and Veidt).
3081;and its enduring appeal .
3082;Perhaps I make too much of this film but these are among the reasons why it continues to hold special meaning for me.
3083;Perfect gift for a Casablanca junkie!
3084;"Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" opens on maps while a narrator gives a detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Casablanca in the French Morocco, as a refugee route from wartime Europe."
3085;It is a remarkable place full of adventurers, international traders, informers, spies, opportunist Vichy Police, German officers, all rounded out by a superb black singer.
3086;pianist Dooley Wilson, the excellent Sam, Rick's only trusted friend.
3087;Casablanca is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns.
3088;What is his magical power?
3089;But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers.
3090;"His way with a line makes ""Casablanca"" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail."
3091;'Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles.
3092;"He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a ""sentimentalist"" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines."
3093;Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love.
3094;"Casablanca covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence
I:8499;3095;the magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy.
I:8499;3096;They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival.
I:8499;3097;one can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place.
I:8499;3098;Its photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly.
I:8499;3099;Bogart's and Bergman's love scenes create a genuinely romantic aura, capturing a sensitivity between the two stars one would not have believed possible.
I:8499;3100;Casablanca is a masterpiece of entertainment, an outstanding motion picture which brought Bogart his first Academy Award nomination (he lost to Paul Lukas for """"Watch On the Rhine"""") and won Awards for Best Picture of the Year, Best Director and Best Screenplay."""
3101;Of course being familiar with WWll helps.
3102;I enjoy it every time I watch it.
3103;I know this movie will bearound forever but again I can only give it four stars.
3104;This is 1940's cinematography at its best, even with wartime strictures on the industry.
3105;The plot is intricate and tightly.
3106;The actors' characterizations are superb.
3107;There is absolutely no grain, no dirt and a wealth of vibrant detail that hasn't been seen since the original release prints were in theaters 60 years ago (and maybe not even then.)
3108;It's like seeing this wonderful classic for the first time again.
3109;One of the best of all times.
3110;I highly recommend this flick to all ages.
3111;Casablanca is one of the top five movies of all time.
3112;Some of the best lines in film history.
3113;And on that level, CASABLANCA is an enormous success.
3114;What makes CASABLANCA the classic it is, is the incredible balance of top.
3115;notch acting, impeccable writing, and flawless pacing by the director.
3116;lastly, the serious nature of the plot finds relief in several moments of humor.
3117;I saw so much more detail and the picture became more rich and enjoyable.
3118;I enjoyed it as much or more than the first time.
3119;The love story is not believable, Bogart is emotionless and delivers like he memorized the lines.
3120;Ingrid Bergman was wonderful and very beautiful.
3121;the suppoeting cast was flawless.
3122;this is one of the best movies ever made without question.
3123;we are off and running with good entertainment.
3124;Bergman's beauty is a thing to behold and Bogart's agony is correspondingly miserable.
3125;Rick, who is a successful restrauteur, has settled into an alcoholic haze following his baffling abandonment by the haunting Bergman in Paris a couple of years earlier.
3126;Much to Rick's chagrin and surprise, Bergman shows up unexpectedly.
3127;Rick's despair is truly a thing to behold and is why Bogart deserves to be rated as one of the truly great actors.
3128;The cynical Vichy French Inspector is indeed perfect as a man who ultimately finds where his loyalties.
3129;"Arrest the usual suspects, he orders, as Bogart, walking away with him in the fog tells him, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
3130;"Skull Rack and ""Hummingbird God""."
3131;This is a must see classic for a new generation.
3132;I had to remember the time period because of some of the racist undertones but otherwise, It was great!
3133;I can watch this movie over and over again.
3134;This movie is a classic and rightfully so.
3135;The soundtrack, the script and the acting are all fantastic.
3136;lover, Ilsa Lund (played stupendously by Ingrid Bergman), walks back into his life.
3137;This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and if you haven't seen it you definitely should.
3138;for love, life and freedom.
3139;I highly recommend this film, and would give it many more stars if I could.
3140;It's a great and entertaining film.
3141;This is a great classic romance movie.
3142;Great to watch near Valentines Day with your valentine.
3143;As long as you have one of the versions from 2003 or later the picture will be excellent.
3144;As for the film, it is one of the top 10 movies ever made and one of the greatest love stories in movie history.
3145;The extras are very good.
3146;The dialogue is so good that some of the lines have become part of our culture.
3147;Actually, on a scale of five stars, I give it an eight.
3148;Watched it again this weekend with my granddaughter who never had seen it.
3149;It is such a beautifully made film with superb acting throughout.
3150;There's a reason that it is at the top of nearly everyone's list of favorite films of all time.
3151;(Incidentally, this edition of Casablanca includes an excellent full.
3152;The acting, the dialogue, the setting and the pacing of this wartime drama combine to produce an outstanding cinematic experience.
3153;A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood.
3154;The whole Amazon xray thing makes another viewing a new learning experience.
3155;This is his defining performance, the one which cemented him as one of the greatest film actors ever!
3156;The character played by Bogart in this film is absolutely larger than life.
3157;But how many men can actually let go of a woman he love, in the interest of greater good for humanity?
3158;K one of my favorite movies and im not even a old guy ha i would recommend this to any one
3159;It is my favorite film of all time.
3160;Everything about this film is wonderful.
3161;The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinamatography all whisk you away to another era.
3162;The film has everything a moviegoer wants.
3163;It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny.
3164;This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.
3165;"and there is the Special
I:8499;3166;who directed some of my all time favorite movies, and charming story about him.
I:8499;3167;This lent a lot of realism to the film.
I:8499;3168;Aside from the movie, the Special Features are well worth a look.
I:8499;3169;A movie that I've seen many times, with great actors, and one that I never get tired of watching again.
I:8499;3170;This is one of his favorites.
I:8499;3171;He thought it looked terrific on blu.
I:8499;3172;I also ordered one for my son.
I:8499;3173;He is an """"old movie"""" buff."""
3174;A drama that tickled my fancy for history, geography, and political science.
3175;Although this movie has had some criticism, I thought it was overall enjoyable.
3176;you actually have to pay attention.
3177;Very good plot, excellent casting and acting.
3178;Very good handling of the black and white techiques at that time.
3179;however, I finally realized that the relationship was strong because of Rick's love for Ilsa.
3180;With this revelation, I was able to see the film for what it was: a masterpiece.
3181;rick own's Rick's Cafe, a seedy bar in Casablanca during WWII.
3182;This makes it a place filled with refugees hoping to escape to America.
3183;He brings his wife to Rick's, the beautiful Ilsa.
3184;This is no surprise because it is a beautiful song, and Dooley Wilson's vocals make it very charming.
3185;Max Steiner's score is wonderful as well.
3186;There is history, intruige, romance, great dialogue, and excellent music.
3187;If that were not enough, on this edition of the VHS is a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall.
3188;Bogart is and always will be my idol.
3189;Casablanca ranks as one of his best with great lines, and a smooth character.
3190;There are moview that are timeless because they could have happened anywhere and at any time.
3191;This movie marks a very specific point in time for both the period of the movie, and the target audience.
3192;And because of that we enjoy the small, silly, triumphs of individuals.
3193;At the same time we know it holds true.
3194;Some things are more important than ourselves, and at the end we can wonder just what that relationship that is starting could possibly be like.
3195;This one could very well be the best.
3196;I just love classic movies and this is one of the best movies ever .
3197;"Certainly ""Casablanca"" is a solid movie with a wonderful theme, a movie so very appropriate for its time."
3198;Humphrey Bogart, an icon in his day lingering in that regard for many to this very day, plays a strong.
3199;Putting one over on the Nazis, I suspect, is what catapulted this film into the favor of its original critics and audiences.
3200;Still it is a strong movie with all the pieces of the puzzle fitting neatly together at the conclusion, but with the feeling that if the puzzle isn't glued, it could easily fall apart.
3201;Loved the fact that was black and white.
3202;Loved the story about the things people do for love.
3203;(That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)
3204;ray Edition includes the features from the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.
3205;Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full.
3206;all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser.
3207;He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.
3208;Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.
3209;Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.
3210;Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.
3211;"Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable
I:8499;3212;The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.
I:8499;3213;Even the music works beyond what was expected, making """"As Time Goes By"""" unforgettable."""
3214;All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.
3215;: Premiere Episode excerpts, from the TV serial based on Casablanca, part of the 1955 Warner Bros.
3216;A Great Cast is Worth Repeating, on the times the cast played together in other movies. . . . .
3217;It's a great one, not to be missed.
3218;This is such an awesome edition!
3219;I love the passport holder!
3220;Love the book and everything that comes with it!
3221;An admission: I've never liked Casablanca.
3222;I'm a huge fan of old movies, but there are better romances out there, and these stars made better films.
3223;what is surprising is my new appreciation for the film.
3224;It looks and sounds wonderful, and features a highly comprehensive package, including two solid commentaries by Rudy Behlmer and Roger Ebert.
3225;Other highlights include a radio production featuring the stars in their original roles, and two fascinating documentaries: one on the film, the other on the life of Humphrey Bogart.
3226;i'm very pleased with this productit's exactly what i wanted and came 10 days early which was a nice surprisevery happy
3227;This movie is a Classic favorite of ours.
3228;There are so many great lines in this movie and I can practically quote them all.
3229;Romantic movie setup during the nazi time.
3230;Keeps some suspense till the end and has a nice ending, full of love.
3231;A story of bravery, romance and the endurance of the human spirit
3232;Great old movie with a story line and developed characters.
3233;In my opinion Casablanca is the greatest movie to ever come out of Hollywood.
3234;A classic blend of wartime drama, romance, intrigue, and suspense, set against a wonderfully atmospheric and exotic background.
3235;All of the actors are terrific.
3236;Bogart and Bergman make a superb romantic couple, Claude Raines is downright hilarious as the corrupt chief of police, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre add a touch of sinisster menace.
3237;All of the characters, even down to the ones with only a line or two give outstanding performances.
3238;the writing is witty and unforgettable, packed with lines that have become immortal.
3239;Crisp direction, atmospheric sets and beautiful black.
3240;white photography make this a superb, highly entertaining film.
3241;I love everything about it!
3242;Simply the best movie ever made.
3243;bogie at his best, Bergman as always splendid!
3244;Add in a wonderful supporting cast headed by Peter Lorre, and the result is the perfect bittersweet love story.
3245;A must have for any Bogart fan, and a must see for everyone!
3246;"The ""newly discovered additional footage"" amounts to under a minute."
3247;The outtakes are of little importance and are mildly entertaining as a curiosity only.
3248;There is a reason why this one is considered one of the all.
3249;Great acting from Bogart and Bergman, along with excellent character actors.
3250;The script creates an excellent blend of drama and some witty humor.
3251;While in some cases, a great cast doesn't guarantee a good movie, this one does, The plot and setting are excellent, and the acting makes it a classic.
3252;known: The beginning of World War II, many immigrated to North Africa and points on the African coast, in advance of the German push into France.
3253;an escapee of a concentration camp and freedom fighter, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) finds his way into Casablanca, hoping to get a plane out and back to the USA and help the Americans (this part of the story was vague).
3254;He brings with him his wife, Ilsa, played adoringly and smartly by Ingrid Bergman.
3255;ilsa walks into Rick's Cafe Americane and who does she see .
3256;He also wants what Rick has .
3257;letters of passage to America, which he could sell for a handsome profit.
3258;lauren Bacall, Bogart's son, Ingrid Bergman's daughter, everyone has a say.
3259;A thorough overview of Bogie's films up to his death in the Fifties is gone over.
3260;Bergman, as the beautiful wife of Resistance leader Paul Henried, finds herself torn between two lovers when she reenters Bogey's life.
3261;the film's GREAT success lies in the inimitable pairing of its two stars, a thoroughly romantic story line, terrific humour and numerous moments of genuine suspence.
3262;Of course, that great ending helps, too!
3263;Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.
3264;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
3265;Good to watch it uncut.
3266;Amazing it was made in 1942 during World War II.
3267;During the darkest years of the catastrophe that was World War II, Warner Brothers studio produced a movie that is, as far as I am concerned, the best movie ever made.
3268;His redemption, and the redemption of the world for which he has spent much of his life fighting, begins when he moves beyond his private agonies to return to the fight for a world worth living in.
3269;Rick's fight is our fight: the fight for social justice, for a decent and humane society, for a world in which FDR's Four Freedoms are more than just a slogan, for a better future in which reckless militarism, racism, oppression are defeated, and people rally to fight for human freedom.
3270;And this time, our side shall win.
3271;disc treasure trove does justice to the quintessential Hollywood film .
3272;a 1942 wartime masterpiece in which everything clicks.
3273;This is one of the Few movies that I do own now.
3274;I feel allot of present day films dont have this kind of magic that makes it jump off the screen.
3275;The characters are real by the performances of the actors, the direction and the writing is solid.
3276;Thier are so many sources that have drawn from this movie.
3277;Its very rare everything just works.
3278;this is a classic that should never have been remade because its impossible.
3279;the Film has a wonderful mix of Humor, Drama and Romance even most guys can even appreciate.
3280;"I've enjoyed him in ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""The Maltese Falcon""."
3281;The actors bring something to that performance that makes the film unique.
3282;I'm a wide screen freak and the film is in Pan and Scan.
3283;The Documentary is really a joy to watch though.
3284;"Almost iconic for Bogart and Bergman
I:8499;3285;This set was truly a great value.
I:8499;3286;Also the service exceededmy expectations.
I:8499;3287;How can you remake one of, if not arguably, the best motion picture film of all time?
I:8499;3288;The answer is simple: you can't.
I:8499;3289;one of the enigmas that makes this film such an incredible feat, is that throughout most of its production, the story wasn't finished.
I:8499;3290;And yet, they obviously found a way to tie the whole story together.
I:8499;3291;He's found his entire idealistic world has been turned upside down.
I:8499;3292;Rick's entire staff goes nuts at this beautiful gesture, which Rick dismisses as a simple gesture to love.
I:8499;3293;it really is fun to watch this film for the first time to see how Rick helps Ilsa and Lazlo.
I:8499;3294;He embodies one of the most memorable characters in film history.
I:8499;3295;Bogart made the trenchcoat and hat a signature outfit as well, not only in Casablanca, but in such films as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.
I:8499;3296;He is one of my favorite actors of all time, and Casablanca is probably my favorite role, although it's very difficult to decide which is best out of all of his great portrayals.
I:8499;3297;Entertainment Weekly had him listed as the best actor of all time and the most entertaining.
I:8499;3298;MGM made the right move in negotiating for Ingrid, as she was under contract with David O Selznick.
I:8499;3299;Bergman is my favorite actress of all time.
I:8499;3300;She brings such passion and ease to her roles, and yet she plays Ilsa with a calm, cool sense until she realizes she can no longer deny her feelings for Rick.
I:8499;3301;Lazlo represents the figure battling for justice and a restoration of a broken world back to what it was.
I:8499;3302;And ironcially, it is Rick who commits the most selfless act, the most loving act in the end.
I:8499;3303;claude Rains is one of my favorite character actors.
I:8499;3304;He can play any part you put in front of him.
I:8499;3305;You also catch a glimpse of this during the film's most powerful moment: when Lazlo asks Rick's band to play the Les Marseillaise to drown out Strasser and the Germans as they sing the anthem of the Third Reich.
I:8499;3306;That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.
I:8499;3307;This is, as Lauren Bacall states during the documentary feature, the true definition of a classic.
I:8499;3308;AFI rated Casablanca as the second best film of all time.
I:8499;3309;I, personally, put it at the top.
I:8499;3310;It is more compelling than Citizen Kane, in my opinion.
I:8499;3311;makes for good alone time with your special one.
I:8499;3312;I recommend this for anyone who loves classic movies.
I:8499;3313;I have seen better on broadcast television.
I:8499;3314;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8499;3315;I love it and can watch it over and over again.
I:8499;3316;Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman (most beautiful woman in the world.
I:8499;3317;I got the kids to watch it, and they loved it as well.
I:8499;3318;This movie is great for the whole family.
I:8499;3319;perfectly cast with Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.
I:8499;3320;All at the top of their game.
I:8499;3321;I've never been sure if this is the best movie ever made, but I'm sure it's among the top few.
I:8499;3322;Also, there is some interesting trivia revaled in Lauren Bacall's documentary.
I:8499;3323;This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and the transfer to Blu.
I:8499;3324;it is a beautiful movie.
I:8499;3325;This is as many Amazon reviewers have already said one of the most popular, if not the most popular and beloved movie of all time.
I:8499;3326;Still there was something about it, a feeling, a certain aura which made it memorable.
I:8499;3327;The famous """"Play it Again Sam"""" his pain and restraint in his love for the Bergmann character are a convincing version of the old Western hero in his silence."""
3328;this movie made in the midst of the Second World War wins our hearts also because it a patriotic one.
3329;The great scene in which Rains contadicts the boisterous Nazis, and orders the singing of the 'Marsellaise ' is in itself a classic.
3330;officer friend , who orders the 'rounding up of the usual suspects' rescues the Bogart.
3331;Bergman farewell from bathos, and makes for a strangely upbeat ending.
3332;Black and white movie that sets the mood for a sad time in the world.
3333;Great actors and good sound with out all the loud background music playing.
3334;Humphrey Bogart is one of my all time favorite actors.
3335;There are many great memorable scenes.
3336;I would recommend this to everyone.
3337;Casablanca is one of my favourite films anyways but this Blu Ray really does it justice and I like all the additions in the package!
3338;Notice what a great time the whole gang at Rick's is having singing along with Dooley.
3339;It is a love story and what some people will do for love of people or Country.
3340;Hogie was a great actor and nobody did it better with his wife, Becall.
3341;The many qualities it shows push it still further ahead of most films, and it has remained not only a classic, but and enduringly popular one.
3342;The acting is excellent, the black and white cinematography is magnificent, and the direction is inspired.
3343;When one finds out how this film was really produced, how many rewrites there were, how ignorant everybody was about the ending, it appears incredible that such a film should flow so beautifully.
3344;And flow it does on the strength of a peculiar love.
3345;rick (Bogart) is a romantic hero with a chance to help those whose causes he has defended his entire life.
3346;Enter Bergman once again into his life, waltzing into his cafe in French.
3347;This is a romantic story and a romantic view at the world at a time when the world was facing a true hour of darkness.
3348;When Peter Lorre's character explains the wonderful nature of these two letters, it is clear that incredible confusion guided much of Casablanca along.
3349;Claude Rains (the police inspector) wins his dignity and a friend.
3350;The love story is there but the lovers rise far above their hill of beans and become truly noble, particularly Rick, the cynic who still hopes.
3351;Such a memorable film produced memorable lines, like Round up the usual suspects, Vultures, vultures everywhere, I stick my neck out for nobody, Here it's looking at you, kid, etc., although Rick never says Play it again, Sam.
3352;"Classics are human
I:8499;3353;The whole is and feels almost perfect.
I:8499;3354;My third favorite film truly gets better every time I watch it.
I:8499;3355;I watched the movie because of its popularity and it met my expectations.
I:8499;3356;Some of the scenes in the movie are beautifully directed and will make you think about them for a very long time.
I:8499;3357;The actors/actress, are the outstanding old timerswho by and large can not be rivaled, ever.
I:8499;3358;So muchtrash has come to the screen in the past 20 years"
3359;I cannot write a review for a film this old and so revered, brilliant, sublime and tightly woven.
3360;Just know, its a true classic with the best black and white nuanced cinematography of its time (or even any time), starring the greatest Hollywood film legends and a marvelously romantic script with lines that will live on for eternity.
3361;Casablanca remains among the most highly regarded of all American films, emerging from an era (1942) when American films had yet no strong foreign competition.
3362;Many aspects of this film remain astonishing: casting and acting, screenplay (based on a stage play), directing, black and white cinematography, almost everything about it.
3363;top in our cynical era.
3364;I know Casablanca is a classic, but I didn't think that it was very good.
3365;It is considered a classic and for good reason.
3366;Well staged, great music, intrigue, and plot twist.
3367;This one has it all.
3368;Added features of this version are well worth any extra price.
3369;It is beyond dispute that Casablanca is the greatest movie ever made.
3370;This is a movie that you do more than watch.
3371;i also have the standard definition colorized version that I enjoy and recommend.
3372;"So I guess I'll just repeat what everyone else has already said: it's one of the greatest films of all time (second, I'd say, after ""Citizen Kane""), it has truly superb acting by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, Claud Rains, and Peter Lorre, it has a great love story, and some of the best cinematography ever."
3373;"**may contain spoliers**I think the main draw and popularity of the film Casablanca is its memorable ""feel."""
3374;The atmosphere that the film creates in memorable for some reason.
3375;humphrey Bogart is a classic cult film icon because he's charming, suave, astute, very self confident, and believable.
3376;"Where an actor in a mainstream film would be laughed at for a line such as Bruce Campbell's, ""Gimme some sugar, baby,"" or Bogart's, ""Here's looking at you kid,"" cult heroes are praised and cheered."
3377;He is sly in his comments, where you aren't sure if you should laugh at the humorous thing he just said.
3378;Yet cult fans know that there is much more than that to make a great film.
3379;Each interacts with one another to put together a single piece that stands on its own.
3380;casablanca has remained a popular cult film for the above reasons.
3381;Though slow at times, it is a memorable film, with memorable characters and dialogue.
3382;At times sappy, the film delivers an almost.
3383;believable love story, that most actors could not make work.
3384;"Yet with the actors we have, the film works as a whole, mainly based upon Bogart and Bergman's ability to ""pull off"" their parts."
3385;I got to see this with someone who was seeing it for the first time, and it was like seeing it for the first time myself.
3386;Some say it was extraordinary for its time, but I think it is just extraordinary.
3387;Just elegant men and women striving to do the right things in a difficult time, with some shady characters and villains for balance.
3388;And humor that did not include sexual innuendo, one.
3389;I thought it would be interesting to take a look first at the lowest rated reviews for the movie.
3390;"first let me say first that ""Casablanca"" is without doubt one of the great classics in American film making."
3391;It's a movie that has stood the test of time and one that I can watch any day of the week and know I'm going to enjoy it all over again.
3392;It is without question one of the top 20 Hollywood movies of the 20th century.
3393;It relied on great acting, tight direction and a plot that actually made you think.
3394;"In conclusion, I say ""Casablanca"" is one of greatest movies put on film for all the right reasons."
3395;This movie has been a loved classic in our home and I decided it was worth purchasing to be able to watch again and again.
3396;The greatest movie of all time.
3397;This one has some interesting extras as well.
3398;wonderful black and white .
3399;recalls how effecive this format can be.
3400;with of course superstars and a wonderful plot.
3401;While there are a few cheesy special effects in the first 5 minutes of the film, from then on this is special.
3402;It's funny, patriotic, suspenseful, and original.
3403;"Bogart is the actor every action hero tries to be
I:8499;3404;It's a guy's guy movie, and the ultimate chick flick, and a great comedy.
I:8499;3405;The storyline is not riveting, but it's wrapped up in the end very well.
I:8499;3406;It is a real gem.
I:8499;3407;it is an unusual love triangle.
I:8499;3408;although I am not usually one who enjoys romance type movies, this one is very good.
I:8499;3409;This one is well worth watching.
I:8499;3410;A master piece always ready to see again want to watch and watch and watch music wonderfully evoking takes me back to old Hollywood
I:8499;3411;One of the all time classics.
I:8499;3412;That era is truly missed, but hopeful that new movies will come and be more smart than some later material from tinseltown.
I:8499;3413;Casablanca remains one of the best American films of the forties.
I:8499;3414;It reflects its Warner Brothers film noir heritage (a casbah shot on a backlot in Burbank) but elevates it into new territory.
I:8499;3415;this is Humphrey Bogart at his best .
I:8499;3416;lover Ingrid Bergman arrives with a new lover, a resistance hero trying to escape to fight on in the free world.
I:8499;3417;I was surprised at how crisp and clear this version of Casablanca looked.
I:8499;3418;bottom line, a surprisingly good viewing experience.
I:8499;3419;If you have seen it, watch it again and again because every time is just as the first.
I:8499;3420;This film is a timeless classic.
I:8499;3421;Must have been how audiences viewed it when first made.
I:8499;3422;The acting is top rate.
I:8499;3423;I love to watch this classic movie from time to time.
I:8499;3424;It has been restored to beautiful black and white brilliance.
I:8499;3425;In fact, being in black and white gives this movie the proper ambiance for the times.
I:8499;3426;It is such an incredible classic and way before its time.
I:8499;3427;I would highly recommend for those Saturday night movie nights with a big bowl of popcorn!
I:8499;3428;That said, the movie is pretty great.
I:8499;3429;It's one of the few chick flicks that a guy can actually watch and enjoy.
I:8499;3430;Having been filmed in the 1940s there are a lot of historical references and actually give you an idea of how things actually were before the US joined WW2.
I:8499;3431;i can only put it like this:The Good:1.
I:8499;3432;The shadows, shading and the attention to detail of the enhancement from the previous versions, is stunning.2.
I:8499;3433;This movie has more memorable scenes than probably your own wedding ceremony.
I:8499;3434;Also, this is probably the most quotable movie ever made and one of the greatest.3.
I:8499;3435;The extras on disc 2 are interesting and enough to give first.
I:8499;3436;A really fantastic film for any age, first.
I:8499;3437;I watch this movie every Sunday, and have done so for about the last 10 years.
I:8499;3438;Humphrey Bogart is absolutely magnificent and unforgettable as Richard 'Rick' Blaine, but Claude Rains does have all the best lines.
I:8499;3439;I can read this same information on the internet or in a multitude of books, with greater insight.
I:8499;3440;I bought this as a gift for my dad for Father's Day and he loves it!
I:8499;3441;He says it's his favorite move!
I:8499;3442;I have seen it many times and enjoy watching it every time.
I:8499;3443;It remains one of my all time favorites.
I:8499;3444;Casablanca was good but not great.
I:8499;3445;I had to see it just because it is one of those movies you must see.
I:8499;3446;This is an absolute masterpiece that I have been meaning to see for quite some time.
I:8499;3447;It is an excellent example of what Hollywood and America was at that time of rugged, individual men that did anything for the women that they loved even if it meant sacrificing their fantasies and desires.
I:8499;3448;He exemplifies American culture, confidence, and bravado that most men back then and now wish they could have that kind of persona.
I:8499;3449;I heavily encourage everyone to watch this film
I:8499;3450;Very happy with the way it was package and everything the item contained.
I:8499;3451;This is a great movie and the extra features only add to the package.
I:8499;3452;Now, I made myself to watch thid film and thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8499;3453;This film got 3 academy aswards for Best Pitcure, Best Director and Best Screenplay.
I:8499;3454;And 5 academy award nominations for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best B/W Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best score.
I:8499;3455;If you are a fan of classics get this one.
I:8499;3456;I wanted to get this movie as a gift.
I:8499;3457;There is a cut through the plastic onto the barcode.
I:8499;3458;This made it very unsuitable as a gift.
I:8499;3459;What really sets this movie apart is the brilliant writing.
I:8499;3460;jerker but it comes in just under the wire and becomes a minor masterpiece.
I:8499;3461;The acting, the writing, the mood, all brilliant.
I:8499;3462;Like many movie fans, this is my favorite movie of all time and it just gets better with age.
I:8499;3463;No matter what movies get made in the future, this will be among the greatest, as time goes by.
I:8499;3464;This is one of my most favorite movie.
I:8499;3465;It is a great story and doesn't need to be over top with violence to tell a good story.
I:8499;3466;This movie has more classic lines than just about any other ever made .
I:8499;3467;Add to that great actors, starting with Bogart, who really makes this movie.
I:8499;3468;His character is magnetic, compelling, bold and yet tender.
I:8499;3469;Claude Rains as the chief inspector brings humor, wit and a sly intelligence to the role.
I:8499;3470;I could fall into this film with a smile on my face.
I:8499;3471;A classic tale of internal struggles, external struggles, love lost, and Nazis.
I:8499;3472;Bogart as Rick plays the Anti Hero, smart, resourceful and jaded while Bergman is everyone's lost love.
I:8499;3473;best movie of all time.
I:8499;3474;But it's probably the best overall and most enjoyable movie ever made.
I:8499;3475;It's got some cool souvenirs, extras, etc.
I:8499;3476;The good news is, relative to the 2008/2009 Blu Ray edition, the resolution appears even higher and more detailed.
I:8499;3477;I take issue with the contrast/gamma so much because of the important use of shadow, both with the characters' faces and costumes, and with the backgrounds, to convey emotional states and atmosphere.
I:8499;3478;I also recommend listening to Ebert's commentary at least one time while viewing the movie.
I:8499;3479;It also has much better contrast/gamma, but I still have to give a slight edge to the 70th.
I:8499;3480;Edition is so good at revealing the grain of the film that it almost hurts to look at it.
I:8499;3481;If you are studying film structure"
3482;The nuances of the dialogue are what I love most about this film.
3483;The tone and detail is excellent and a perfect recreation of the film.
3484;CASABLANCA is a great film because of the weaving together of the three plots at climax that gives Rick's final action simultaneous meaning on the personal, interpersonal and social levels.
3485;At climax, Rick chooses to give up the chance to be with Ilsa by coming to terms with the civic and patriotic responsibilities in a world in upheaval.
3486;But with one more twist it reaches greatness by completing Ricks' internal journey from bystander to patriot.
3487;plots: Victor and Ilsa are guaranteed to escape and Rick has sealed his fate as a patriot.
3488;plots reach a positive climax as the main love story between Rick and Ilsa plummets to its classic anti.
3489;He sacrifices the chance to be with Ilsa to become a true patriot of the world.
3490;We are touched by the great story because of what has been won by Rick's noble sacrifice.
3491;This is all time great classics movie that everyon should have in their collection
3492;The cast alone makes it perfect.
3493;The supporting cast is also outstanding.
3494;This is a true classic.
3495;AAA+ 5 stars, highly recommended.
3496;Just as I remembered it and much better than the tape I had previously.
3497;Loved the intrigue, geography, history that I didn't appreciate as a younger viewer.
3498;a gift for my hubby is favorite movie, he can watch it over and over I will look at it one day
3499;One of my favorite movies of all time.
3500;Great love story with amazing actors and the song.
3501;The one that always brings that smile to your soul.
3502;Dinner and movie and, if both survive, maybe a second date.
3503;The one component of such a date is the movie choice .
3504;"Although many times deemed as a ""chic flic,"" a love story can make or break a date and, consequently, a relationship."
3505;The setting of the movie has a great impact on its viewers, if the film is set in a foreign country there is an added aura of mystery and danger.
3506;The fact that story takes place in Paris and mainly Casablanca adds to the romanticism of the movie.
3507;"Paris, ""the city of lights,"" is considered to be a very romantic city and Casablanca is a very exotic location."
3508;Those watching the film gain an added sense of wonder and excitement with foreign location, instead of the familiar sites of their homeland.
3509;The time frame of the movie also adds to its fame.
3510;The constant presence of army officials adds an element of danger to the film, therefore making every action of the characters even more meaningful because they are risking their lives for the sake of someone they love.
3511;The time frame also adds to the viewer's identification with the movie.
3512;Adding to the aspect of danger is the element of drama, which gives the filmmaker the ability to play with the emotions of the audience.
3513;These phrases not only add to the drama, but have become universal and add to the lasting popularity and remembrance of the film.
3514;Casablanca is one of the most visually powerful movies there is.
3515;The movie contains unforgettable scenes that leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
3516;It is a classic that still brings us to tears every time we watch it.
3517;What makes this such a great love story is the ending.
3518;The story encompasses the kind of love that everyone wants to feel for someone .
3519;For one, there is an excellent cast.
3520;"Another thing are the classic ""lines"" ."
3521;which are memorable, and so perfectly timed.
3522;(There are so many of them, one has to see it a few times to catch them all.)
3523;The romantic part is just what all movies are expected to have: romantic, comedy, what is going to happen (i. e. boy meets girl, loses girl, then gets girl USUALLY), and then there is a great cast.
3524;it worked perfectly the way it was.
3525;This classic movie is more that a love story, more that a political statement.
3526;Casablanca is arguably one of the finest pieces of film ever constructed.
3527;The use of Hitchcockian lighting sets a mood so stirring that the viewer is drawn into the story without the awareness of the passage.
3528;The sacrifices of love, the loss of human dignity which invariably accompanies war and a man's rediscovery of his lost humanity are all intregral subplots in this stirring tale of love.
3529;I can only remark on it's arrival condition, as I bought it for a gift, so I haven't seen it.
3530;Bogart, the original man's man.
3531;Great story, lots of lines that are still used today.
3532;Best movie ever made, Ingrid Bergman is sooo beautiful.
3533;It arrived very quickly so I was happy about that.
3534;It definitely is a Collectors item.
3535;A perfect screenplay, superb acting, and wonderful music.
3536;Anyone who loves movies must see this film.
3537;This is a move for the whole family to enjoy.
3538;My husband and I enjoy watching this movie.
3539;great movie, i watch it twice a year at least.
3540;fast moving and clever story line.
3541;it is like other movies, even more so.
3542;This is one of the all time classic films ever made.
3543;We all know Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all time.
3544;disc Special Editions of their classic films.
3545;disc Special Edition of Casablanca is spectacular.
3546;The film itself has been nicely cleaned up and is presented in glorious black and white, with its soundtrack cleaned up and presented in all it's original mono glory.
3547;Trailers are always a welcome inclusion, as it allows a peek at how films were promoted through the years.
3548;disc 2 contains some excellent bonus materials, as well.
3549;A gallery, some audio stuff, a couple of documentaries, a cartoon, and a TV show.
3550;"The ""You Must Remember This"" documentary will be familiar to pretty much anyone who owns a video of the movie from 1993 and later."
3551;This particular revision will most definitely be familiar to anyone who owns the 1998 Special Edition VHS.
3552;the best bonus by far is the feature.
3553;Narrated by his wife, actress Lauren Bacall, the documentary delves into Bogey's life and his remarkable career, as well as his marriage to Bacall.
3554;is the 1995 cartoon parody tribute, Carrotblanca, starring Bugs Bunny as Rick.
3555;It's a clever parody and tribute to a classic movie.
3556;All are welcome inclusions here.
3557;And Warner Bros. continues to release more spectacular Special Editions every year.
3558;Bogart and Bergman are superb!
3559;Old Hollywood at its best.
3560;She was simply magnificent in Gaslight, Spellbound, Anastasia, Notorious, and Cactus Flower.
3561;, To Have and Have not, and They Drive by Night , they were just great films with or without Bogie!
3562;dimensional character in every film.
3563;This movie is a wonderful classic to watch and to own.
3564;Got a really great price on Amazon.
3565;Bought one as a gift and one for myself.
3566;watch this movie because its romantic, and it has a lot of classic one.
3567;The visual remaster is pretty good, though you may want to turn the sound up so you can understand what everyone is saying.
3568;A timeless tale set on the coast of West Africa, the action, love, and suspense cannot be ignored or forgotten.
3569;altering secrets, and unmistakable passion.
3570;A superb performance by both Bogart and Bergman, this classic will last through the ages as one of the best love stories the world has ever known.
3571;Great movie, love the actors and the plot, to bad they did not do a second one.
3572;If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.
3573;One of my boyfriends favorite of all time!
3574;Thanks Amazon Prime for a great, free movie!
3575;I had never heard of this movie before I bought it, and wow!
3576;what a great little flick!
3577;They are 2 extraordinary actors and the supporting cast is outstanding
3578;Bogart, Bergman, and Rains are fantastic!!
3579;The acting was top notch.
3580;What a classic Will watch it again
3581;I had never seen Casablanca and I had to watch it for an apologetics class.
3582;Although over dramatic it still was very well done and I can see how it is classic.
3583;good flick and a must have .
3584;This is a great film no matter the format.
3585;You should have this film if you like older films, especially a classic Bogart film like this, and Ingrid is a beautiful as ever.
3586;I actually loved this movie .
3587;I thought the film was amusing, and it moved pretty quickly, which is something I find key since I really dislike slow movies.
3588;It has a good plot line and keeps you guessing until the very end!
3589;It's among my favourite films.
3590;The characters are superp, the sets and costumes are superb, Bogie is wonderful, and Bergman rips my heart out everytime she walks into Rick's Cafe Americain dressed in that gorgeous white travelling suit.
3591;Come on, is it that hard to put it in it's original cinematic widescreen glory???
3592;An entertaining documentary hosted by Laruen Bacall is a step in the right direction, but this is CASABLANCA, MAN!
3593;"Put some effort into it, for Pete's sake
I:8499;3594;casablanca is timeless, it really is.
I:8499;3595;This film still holds its own against the films of today.
I:8499;3596;No special effects just good actors and a very well crafted story.
I:8499;3597;Most of these individuals are looking for one of three things: a drink, freedom, or love.
I:8499;3598;She is beautiful and she is directly connected to the resistance.
I:8499;3599;This film asks the big questions in a fun way.
I:8499;3600;It is still going strong today and you certainty don't need special effects to see why.
I:8499;3601;Watch it then, watch it now, and watch it tomorrow: Casablanca is as cool as they come.
I:8499;3602;This is, without a doubt, the best that this film has ever looked.
I:8499;3603;It's a timeless classic and everyone should experience it at least once.
I:8499;3604;the set itself is sturdy and robust.
I:8499;3605;It includes a wonderful book, a set of coasters (that a drop of condensation will never touch in my home), and a series of small reproductions of the film's posters.
I:8499;3606;All of it is informative and compelling.
I:8499;3607;Just as """"Gone With The Wind"""" raised the costume drama to new heights, """"Casablanca"""" defined the Hollywood romance, with a touch of film noir thrown in."""
3608;What's remarkable is that all the contributors to this film did solid work before and after this, but for some reason they only gelled like this once, here.
3609;shadow, the exotic locals and transport planes that whisk our heroes to safety.
3610;There's much pleasantness on the surface in Rick's cafe, but there's always intrigue boiling just underneath.
3611;It probably mirrored how a lot of Americans felt during the time.
3612;She manages to suggest so much with a glance, a shrug, and both she and Bogart have long pasts that are wisely not dealt with in detail.
3613;We can fill in the blanks, which just makes the characters more alluring and appealing.
3614;the supporting cast hits all the right notes, with special kudos to Claude Rains for what might be the best acting job in the film.
3615;The virtuals of the film are such that we don't worry too much about these details however: we just enjoy being invited into Rick's Cafe, and as long as we are in its cozy and fascinating interiors we will forgive certain transgressions of logic.
3616;Ebert's enthusiasm for the film bubbles over, and he dispells many of the myths that have cropped up regarding Casablanca over the years.
3617;The documentary on Bogart's life and career is interesting, especially when the films he produced with his own company are discussed.
3618;An interesting bit of trivia: he developed and starred in a now relatively.
3619;fantastic acting by an ensemble cast.

3621;"winning ""Casablanca,"" directed by Michael Curtiz, was and still is without question Bogart's greatest career."
3622;defining moment, the movie on which his legendary status is grounded more than on any other of his multiple successes.
3623;"The film's story is based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's,"" renamed by Warner Brothers in order to tag onto the success of the studio's 1938 hit ""Algiers"" (starring Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr)."
3624;"Building on the success of 1941's ""The Maltese Falcon"" and further expanding Bogart's increasingly complex on."
3625;And the movie's countless famous one.
3626;liners have long attained legendary status in their own right .
3627;writing to camera work, editing, score and the stars' presentation in the movies themselves and in their trailers, was at least partly responsible for its lasting success.
3628;From Rick's perspective, everything is going just swell and the way it is meant to be: he is reasonably well.

3631;disc special edition is unquestionably superior to the prior single.
3632;"time crowning achievement, a ""must"" in every movie lover's collection, and one of the few films that truly deserve the title ""classic."""
3633;Casablanca is a motion picture classic beloved by millions.
3634;"the film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked: Michael Curtiz's direction
I:8499;3635;class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson)"
3636;no movie has more memorable dialogue.
3637;"With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other ""classic"" films, such as ""Citizen Kane"", I was expecting a big let down."
3638;The plot stayed interesting and the ending had a good twist as well.
3639;Because I've seem it so many times.
3640;I like the lead actors.
3641;I believe it's a classic.
3642;A magical storyGreat to view it in a crystal clear video.
3643;It is a great classic.
3644;It was never meant to be but it is a great love story.
3645;what an absolutely gorgeous print of Casablanca (1943) this Blu.
3646;One of my favorite black and white movie.
3647;A must have for those who love classic movies.
3648;and this movie is a classic of cinema!!
3649;This is hands down the greatest movie ever made.
3650;Casablanca may very well be the greatest movie ever made.
3651;It has action, romance, deciet, and some of the greatest one liners ever.
3652;This movie is one of the top ten classics.
3653;just the best as it moves right along without a hitch.
3654;The characters, the performances, the story, the ending.
3655;If you have watched, watch again and again and again.
3656;Casablanca is one of those movies that everyone can find something to like about it.
3657;Even 70 years later, this movie is still one of the most popular movies ever made.
3658;Set in the city of Casablanca in unoccupied French territory, the story is full of intrigue, a triangle love story, great characters, and too many one.
3659;One night, the love of his life walks in to his bar setting the whole story in motion.
3660;This is a fabulous movie that can be watched over and over again.
3661;It has all the elements of a great movie and should not be missed.
3662;Simply put, this is one of the coolest characters in movie history.
3663;Ingrid Bergman is great as Ilsa, a woman who has a romantic link to Rick in the past.
3664;Bogie and Bergman are great together throughout making their relationship truly believable.
3665;Claude Rains gives an excellent performance as Captain Renault, a French officer who plays both the Allies and the Germans.
3666;There are too many extras to even mention, but they are all worthwhile.
3667;Movie fans everywhere will love this classic movie.
3668;Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all time.
3669;The superior acting performances by the extensive cast is unlike anything I've ever seen before.
3670;There are so many actors with key roles in this movie, and all of them deliver, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
3671;They have a magical chemistry between them that is believable and appealing.
3672;Ingrid Bergman has incredible presence on screen, and is beautiful.
3673;"Something that I found rather funny while watching this movie is the number of times the word, 'Casablanca' is said
I:8499;3674;Casablanca is recommended viewing as a film depicting romance, war, and self.
I:8499;3675;This movie definitely should be in anyone's all time top ten.
I:8499;3676;Bogart is pretty much flawless.
I:8499;3677;Ingrid Bergman is also exceptional.
I:8499;3678;And if, for some reason, you should ask me why, I will tell you that """"Casablanca"""" belongs in every person's cinematic library, because it is quite possibly the finest film ever released."""
3679;Every last scene is classic.
3680;Everything about it is classic, not because it's an old film, but because it IS film.
3681;Casablanca is the very embodiment of why movies are made, and it has all the elements of impeccable filmmaking.
3682;"The man is a classic example of the ""tragic hero"" who was so popular in 1940s and 50s cinema, particularly film noir: on the outside, he's a cynical, cold, wisecracking individual, but inside he's a kindhearted, courageous human being who can't help but do what's right."
3683;There's something about Humphrey Bogart that remains unexplained to this day, something that made him so powerful a leading man.
3684;But a leading man is nothing without a leading lady, and so we have Ingrid Bergman, one of the screen's most dazzling beauties.
3685;"She was at her most dazzling in ""Casablanca,"" another tragic character whose actions are as heartbreaking to the audience as they are to Rick, but in the end they're understandable and we sympathize."
3686;She put every fiber of her being into her performance, and she breathes so much humanity into the character of Ilse that we can't help but forgive her and sympathize.
3687;equally important is the supporting cast.
3688;It's amazing how vibrant each of the characters are, no matter how small or large their roles.
3689;Claude Rains' character is particularly interesting: he walks the line between the good guys and the bad guys throughout the picture, sometimes swaying to one side and sometimes to the other, but we're never quite sure who's side he's on until the climax.
3690;"so much of ""Casablanca""'s appeal lies in its story and characters."
3691;The story is timeless, romantic, and, of course, dramatic.
3692;The grimness of the war is a powerful backdrop for Rick and Ilsa's love, the shining light through all the darkness.
3693;"That philosophy was cemented in ""Casablanca,"" where good triumphs evil, and it will always triumph so long as people are willing to fight."
3694;"The film says that there is goodness in us all
I:8499;3695;But the resistance man, the movie's stalwart hero,"""" knows better."""
3696;Casablanca is as 'human' as film as ever there was.
3697;"But the characters in ""Casablanca"" have a remarkably deep, realistic feel to them."
3698;They each have a story to tell, a life of their own, human feelings, human desires.
3699;The flashback sequence was possibly the first to ever figure prominently in a major motion picture, and it's one of the most strong and memorable scenes in the movie.
3700;The editing is flawless .
3701;Finally, the photography is beautiful.
3702;This is the crown jewel of artistic achievement.
3703;"Whether it's the greatest film in history will always be the subject of much debate, but no sane person will deny that ""Casablanca"" is among the absolute finest masterworks of cinema."
3704;We'll always have Paris, Rick tells Ilsa in one of the film's signature scenes.
3705;"Until the end of time, cinema lovers will always have and treasure ""Casablanca."""
3706;Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor of all time.
3707;My most favorite movie is The African Queen but Casablanca is second.
3708;The 5th best movie, next to 1st Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, 2nd G1odfather and Schindler's List!
3709;I'll give it 4.4 stars.
3710;A marvelous movie with all the foreign intrigue you could want.
3711;a true love story wrecked by war.
3712;That much is true of all 1940s movies.
3713;contemporary movies can't manage a fraction of the suspense this one provides.
3714;Excellent in our time with old world class and charm!
3715;Bogart and Bergman what a perfect pairing for this classic tale.
3716;Every scene in Casablanca is a triumph of art.
3717;The many relationships within the cast are all solidly structured including Rick and Sam, who seizes control at times (much like Mammie in GWTW).
3718;Like many fans of Casablanca, I could write thousands of words before touching lightly on all of this movie's virtues.
3719;Many reviewers rate Casablanca the greatest movie of all time.
3720;I agree, adding The Best Years of Our Lives and The Wizard of Oz as a three way tie.
3721;Easily, one of the best films ever made, Michael Curtiz' direction, Bogart's Bergman's performance, the performances of the supporting cast (especially Claude Rains) and the writing congeal to make this film a rewarding experience for anyone.
3722;It is in fact required viewing because of its impact as a cultural touchstone for America in the 20th Century.
3723;Simply put, one of the best movies of all time and a classic!
3724;A must see movie no matter how old you are.
3725;Casablanca has always been one of my favorite movies.
3726;The greatest thrill was when you could actually see it projected on the big screen.
3727;I have to admit, the boxed goodies alone are worth the price.
3728;I think the book about Casablanca as well as the drawings is an incredible addition.
3729;The coasters are kind of fun, too.
3730;The blacks are very black and the shadows are spectacular.
3731;So I give an A+ to seeing the movie as if it was fresh out of film box.
3732;The extras are some carry overs from the last release, but they have added quite a bit about the legacy of the Warner Brothers themselves.
3733;This is truly the way that that the film was meant to be seen.
3734;and excellent transfer in blu.
3735;ray, one of the best I've seen in b/w.
3736;The book also serves as an excellent reference.
3737;This is a timeless classic.
3738;We saw this for the first time quite recently and afterwords both my wife and I were absolutely astonished with 1) how great this movie is and 2) how we had both managed to go so many years without seeing it.
3739;She loves the old classics and yet, she had never seen this and it was a real pleasure for me to watch her experience this movie for the first time.
3740;The creation of this true work of art in an environment dedicated to the mass production of films gives hope to every artist who's had to perform commercially.
3741;scenes exploration of _Casablanca_ with an actual appreciation of the way in which deadlines and pressure can help the artist make a better product.
3742;likewise, the way in which the film's producers and director led the project is a fascinating exploration of management science.
3743;I'm not sure that any major American film gives such a positive spin to heartbreak as this one.
3744;Casablanca is a classic story of love and sacrifice.
3745;Again this is a great classic movie that you never get tired of watching.
3746;I think I had ordered it in color but got it in black and white which to me is the best way to watch it as that was how it was made.
3747;The story, hits it out of the park.
3748;When I was younger and people talked about the greatest movies of all time CASABLANCA almost always entered into the conversation.
3749;cASABLANCA is an American classic.
3750;It has a great plot, interesting characters, and wonderful dialogue.
3751;Yes, it is in black and white, it is a love story, and it does take place in a bar.
3752;Now I enjoy them and seeing a film of that age with such a great story makes it even that much more enduring.
3753;Now, I can empathize with his struggles.
3754;"As for the boring bar that I thought was so lame
I:8499;3755;all in all, a superb movie that deserves to be called an American classic.
I:8499;3756;It is perfectly understandable that this is so.
I:8499;3757;done movies I have ever seen, and I've seen many a good movie.
I:8499;3758;Humphery Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are superb as Rick and Ilsa, and set the standard for how acting should be done.
I:8499;3759;Casablanca is a terrific movie with a perfect blend of witty sarcasm, saddness and patriotism.
I:8499;3760;Enjoy it as I have.
I:8499;3761;One of the Greatest masterpieces in the history of cinema, unforgetable,legendary,classic.
I:8499;3762;One of the greatest passions in history.
I:8499;3763;Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, a masterpiece of many things.
I:8499;3764;Starring the greatest actor of the 20th century in one of the most famous roles and heroes in history, Humphrey Bogart.
I:8499;3765;Because still has love for Rick and his for her, he helps them leave Casablanca, which makes him a hero.
I:8499;3766;This is sensational,touching,brilliant,pure legendary entertainment, Humphrey Bogart at his best and most famous role, Rick is the man for women to fall in love with.
I:8499;3767;As Time goes by this film is timeless, it's still brand new, it's a film of our age and any age.
I:8499;3768;This film has one of the most famous film endings.
I:8499;3769;The story is great, the script is quick and snappy and the chemistry is one of a kind.
I:8499;3770;What is amazing about this movie is that after 60 years, even with most of it's famous lines having entered our modern vernacular, it hasn't lost its edge.
I:8499;3771;Upon viewing again last night with a friend who has not seen it, I realized that this is essential viewing for those who want an introduction to Classic Hollywood.
I:8499;3772;While it does not have a lot of the bells and whistles that usually accompany a popular film, it really doesent need to.
I:8499;3773;The movie is strong enough to stand alone without a commentary by a surving cast member or a film scholar.
I:8499;3774;It has a short and sweet documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall and a bevvy of trailers for other films starring Bogey.
I:8499;3775;That feature I actually found helpful since I myself am always looking to increase my knowledge of classic film.
I:8499;3776;Perhaps not in all of cinema's history has there been a movie with such brilliant writing, scoring, acting, and numbers of emotional close ups.
I:8499;3777;casablanca is a legend of nearly 70 years, but thanks to Blu Ray technology it doesn't have to feel that way.
I:8499;3778;There's not a trace of grain or flicker or anything you'd expect from a film this old, and the result is stunning.
I:8499;3779;If you've seen the movie before, it's time to relive with this remarkable new technology.
I:8499;3780;If you've somehow missed it on TCM, get cultured and experience one of the greatest films in our history in a way no generation has ever been able to do.
I:8499;3781;It not only improves the viewing experience, but it invites the viewer right into the moment.
I:8499;3782;With clarity as perfect as this, you forget you're even watching a film and instead feel as though you've tapped into the memories of the characters portrayed.
I:8499;3783;In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best I've seen.
I:8499;3784;It is a classic, and it is an experience, and with Blu Ray it's better than ever before.
I:8499;3785;One of the best films ever.
I:8499;3786;Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and an all star supporting cast bring the viewer back to WW II France in exile with a spectacular love triangle.
I:8499;3787;Every character, every actor down to the smallest supporting actor and every line is absolutely perfect.
I:8499;3788;but what exactly is so special about it?
I:8499;3789;Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film?
I:8499;3790;When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do).
I:8499;3791;And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"""")"""
3792;stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all.
3793;time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam.
3794;dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'.
3795;He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen.
3796;"I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"")"
3797;A recommended watch for anyone.
3798;I never saw it before and am so glad I had the opportunity to watch this great film.
3799;Superb acting and wonderful story.
3800;Must have been a real moral.
3801;It's an introduction to a magical world to which we feel we must be a part of.
3802;star cast and moving dialogues, Casablanca is a treat, any comments about which from me, will spoil your pleasure when watching it.
3803;brilliant classic movie, greatest black and white movie for a long time, brilliant actor and actress, very moving, spirit uplifting
3804;It's as good as it gets.
3805;Not dated, still works and is just a pitch perfect film start to finish.
3806;This is worth seeing again and again and each time you see it you feel like the first time your saw it .
3807;This is one of the best movies of all times.
3808;Every year or so, I get this feeling that forces me to look up the movie and enjoy it once again.
3809;Bogart's cool in this movie transcends time.
3810;There would be spectacular explosions, special effects, and Ilsa would show more skin.
3811;May we live in interesting times.
3812;I'm guessing Casablanca is the most referenced film in history.
3813;There is good reason for this, as you can cut the mystique surrounding it with a knife.
3814;It has one of the finest scripts, among other things.
3815;The story behind the writing of Casablanca is legendary.
3816;As it turned out, it ended up one of the classiest and most iconic of all classic films.
3817;Laslo is an international hero, fighting for the resistance against the Third Reich.
3818;flashback: the story is a love triangle, but it is innocent enough.
3819;"Rick reveals that he is still in love with her
I:8499;3820;casablanca is full of interesting and wonderful characters, played by some of the best character actors at the time.
I:8499;3821;S. z. (Cuddles) Sakall is the wonderfully sentimental waiter Carl.
I:8499;3822;Dooley Wilson is Rick's man and pianist, the memorable Sam.
I:8499;3823;the ambiance of Casablanca, and of Rick's Cafe Americane in particular, is part of the wonder of the film.
I:8499;3824;torn, continues to mesmerize audiences.
I:8499;3825;casablanca won three Oscars: Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture (Hal Wallis) and Best Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch).
I:8499;3826;It was also nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson), Best Film Editing (Owen Marks) and Best Music Score (Max Steiner).
I:8499;3827;Interesting depiction of the times.
I:8499;3828;I liked it a lot, but can't say I loved it.
I:8499;3829;The characters evidently speak more to others than they do to me.
I:8499;3830;One of the all,time best movies to watch over and over.
I:8499;3831;so many classic lines, so quotable.
I:8499;3832;This is a classic for a reason.
I:8499;3833;The theme is universal and ageless.
I:8499;3834;Directed by Michael Curtiz from a marvelous screenplay written by Julius Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, Casablanca has transcended the era it was made in.
I:8499;3835;The definition of a classic is exactly that"
3836;There aren't a lot of films worthy of such a recent reissue and expansion but this classic film deserves it in spades.
3837;with an outstanding supporting cast including Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet (who was so popular that he was teamed again with Peter Lorre in another film shortly after Casablanca), Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt, everything seems effortless in this classic film.
3838;that's the best compliment you can give any film.
3839;"So many undeserving movies have won Academy Awards that it's amazing when a great motion picture actually does win
I:8499;3840;a nearly flawless print and beautiful transfer have been used to produce this remastered edition.
I:8499;3841;The crisp, black and white images look amazingly sharp given the age of the film.
I:8499;3842;The bright and clean look of the film is probably due to significant digital clean up and it was well worth the effort.
I:8499;3843;The documentaries included on the second disc sound terrific though.
I:8499;3844;there's two strong commentary tracks one by film critic Roger Ebert and the other by film historian Rudy Behlmer.
I:8499;3845;Of the two, I found Ebert's track the most fun and informative at the same time.
I:8499;3846;Behlmer's commentary is fine and provides lots of interesting background and trivia for the viewer but Ebert is the better entertainer.
I:8499;3847;While the documentary You Must Remember This appeared on the previous edition, the other extras are, for the most part, new and exclusive to this edition.
I:8499;3848;It's inclusion allows fans of the film to replace the earlier edition.
I:8499;3849;bacall on Bogart provides quite a bit of insight into Bogart.
I:8499;3850;Having Bogart's widow and fellow actor Bacall host the special that was original produced by Turner Entertainment and WNET was a savvy move.
I:8499;3851;Lauren Bacall manages to provide insightful observations about Bogart's career and how he ended up doing Casablanca.
I:8499;3852;Directed by David Heeley and written by John L. Miller, the documentary is breezy and information.
I:8499;3853;The use of clips and stills also benefits the program making the documentary less static than most.
I:8499;3854;Is an interesting alternative to the film.
I:8499;3855;While the characters and some of the situations are familiar, the pilot provides enough minor surprises to make it worth viewing.
I:8499;3856;Warner also presents the original radio broadcast by the Screen Guild Players a feature frequently found on many of Criterion's discs of vintage films.
I:8499;3857;It's fun having this bit of history included.
I:8499;3858;This hilarious short was produced back in 1995.
I:8499;3859;Carrotblanca looks colorful and vivid in a terrific transfer.
I:8499;3860;If this is what Warner has done to their stable of classic cartoons set for release later in October of 2003, then Looney Tunes fans are in for a treat.
I:8499;3861;The new print and transfer are vivid and vibrant besting even the earlier edition (which looked very good, indeed).
I:8499;3862;most film fans would pay a king's ransom to get their special movie treated with as much class and respect as this one.
I:8499;3863;I was only 16 at the time but I still consider the most memorable movie ever.
I:8499;3864;I liked the acting with Humphrey Bogart and others.
I:8499;3865;The seller was quick to respond and the product was received immediately in excellent condition.
I:8499;3866;highly recommend this seller in all respects.
I:8499;3867;A nice additional to your video library.
I:8499;3868;The print of the film is fantastic.
I:8499;3869;I have watched this disc a couple of times all ready and this film holds up over time.
I:8499;3870;Although Citizen Kane is still my favorite movie of all time this one rates as the best romantic film.
I:8499;3871;Of course the movie gets 5 stars, as it's one of the best ever.
I:8499;3872;It really is a timeless movie.
I:8499;3873;It is, in all honesty, an abomination.
I:8499;3874;This is a wonderful collector's item.
I:8499;3875;The price is right, the movie is beautifully restored with the new digital transfer with an Introduction by Lauren BacallThe deleted scenes and outtakes are real jewels.
I:8499;3876;as a Looney Tunes fan I appreciated the The Looney Tunes homage Carrotblanca.
I:8499;3877;The Photos, press materials, studio correspondence, memorabilia, musical outtakes, and production history are an added bonus.
I:8499;3878;This is a perfect movie.
I:8499;3879;The location, the characters, the humor, the actors, the music, the plot, the war, the intrigue, the love affair, the hero, the exotic place name.
I:8499;3880;It's the style, one of a kind and exquisite.
I:8499;3881;It is the object of desire that gives the story its energy to propel it and to keep the audience wanting to know who's after it next.
I:8499;3882;It is of it's time and the people who came together to make it, including the actors were unique in their own character.Yes, We'll always have Casablanca.
I:8499;3883;The only thing it's got going for it is a couple of big name actors.
I:8499;3884;What, pray tell, is exceptional about this film?
I:8499;3885;The cast is amazing with Bogart and Bergman as the leads accompanied by Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, and Peter Lorre in the supporting cast.
I:8499;3886;The writing is exquisite as is the cinematography.
I:8499;3887;It is also about romance, dreams, and the price we pay to protect the ones we love.
I:8499;3888;I've always loved this movie"
3889;To have it on Blu Ray, in this wonderful collector's box, with all the additional goodies .
3890;Wish that hadn't happened as that movie has our favorite line in it: Here's looking at you kid .
3891;ray edition is well worth the money for an older film.
3892;If you have seen it this is a great edition and the interviews and discussions that have been added are very interesting.
3893;When I first noticed the blu ray edition I snatched it right up.
3894;The audio and video transfers are immaculate and as good as any theatrical showing.
3895;"It is no misjudgement that ""Casablanca"" is the greatest film ever to come out of Hollywood."
3896;Humphrey Bogart's rivetting portrayal of nightclub owner Rick has stood the test of time, and is only complemented by Ingrid Bergman's outstanding performance as his beautiful ex.
3897;He is enjoying a relatively carefree existance until Victor Laslo arrives in town.
3898;With Nazi supporters all around, Rick knows that providing aid to Laslo is an unwise venture.
3899;He can either escape with the woman he loves to Lisbon(leaving Laslo at the mercy of the Nazis), or sacrifice all that he has worked to achieve and help the fugitive couple escape to freedom.
3900;don't deny yourself the opportunity to own the greatest drama to ever grace the silver screen.
3901;"Once you see it you'll love it, and as the underlying themesong of the film says, you'll only love it more ""As Time Goes By."""
3902;I've probably seen this movie more times than any other, and I'll keep watching it, year after year.
3903;a lot has been said about Casablanca, so all I can add is my personal impressions.
3904;a resistance hero, a man without a country, a cheerfully venial functionary.
3905;Something in it captivated people, though, and keeps captivating them today.
3906;One of the greatest movies ever.
3907;I'll watch it many, many more and enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it.
3908;The movie was an instant success with audiences everywhere, and won three Academy Awards including Best Picture.
3909;Called America's most popular and beloved movie.
3910;Filled with mystery, suspense, intrigue and romance, Casablanca will remain a favorite of classic movie lovers for years to come.

3913;this is the story about love.
3914;all of the precious manners in the world are toghether in this movie and in Rick's phenomenon!
3915;this is one of my favorite movies.
3916;our relationship was a complex of mystery and love.
3917;I was in love with her, she was in love with me.
3918;that was the best time in my life.
3919;best time of my life!
3920;I met her alone and found out she was in love with me all the time.

3926;I'm not an old movie buff by any means but this film is just chock full of interesting characters and flows with one classic scene or line following another from start to finish.
3927;The greatest final twenty minutes in a film?
3928;Certainly there are more classic moments in this film than in any I can think of off hand.
3929;I had the pleasure of sharing this with my 16 year.
3930;It was fascinating to see her posture change as the climax built.
3931;We have seen thousands of movies, many war movies, many love stories, many spy movies, but this one is always there, clear in the memory of our mind.
3932;I don't know, but is remains my favorite movie of all time.
3933;"i watch this on a 96"" screen and the image is sharp!"
3934;I recommend it to all people who like classic movies.
3935;Why is this 1942 movie the great classic cult film?Bookcases have been filled with answers to this question.
3936;The most important point is however that you should first see the movie.
3937;the story is timeless, the lines easy to remember, the shots are often perfect and watching the film cannot be a disappointment.
3938;the film is famous for the story that up to the last moment the directors had not clear ending in mind.
3939;Their solution, although highly improbable, is perfect: the committed hero gets the girl, the girl is acted upon (she has no influence on her fate), and the cowboy hero strolls towards the sunset towards new adventures.
3940;regardless of your motivation: you have to see this movie
3941;A good classic black and white movie.
3942;It's a classic that anyone who likes classic will like.

3953;One of my very favorite movies!
3954;Quite simply, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made.
3955;I don't consider myself anything of a film expert, but I know a good film when I see one.
3956;It's hard to imagine that the part of Rick was originally scripted for Ronald Reagan, but Bogart's performance is flawless, as is Bergman's.
3957;A lot of people may find the storyline somewhat dry by today's standards, but I love it.
3958;All of the actors have marvelous voices.
3959;, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a pulse and a soul.
3960;Easy to watch and be swept up in the nostalgia of how popular this movie will always be.
3961;Stanley Kubrick moved to England to evade it and Robert Altman totally ignored it.
3962;But as Roger Ebert points out in his excellent commentary, Casablanca shows what that system could accomplish.
3963;somehow Wallis and his team came up with a masterpiece.
3964;This movie is required viewing.
3965;So many phrases and tropes came out of this very creative original film.
