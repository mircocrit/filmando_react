1;I love this movie to death.
2;The plot is great and it's not full of sex, drugs and too much violence.
3;The colors pop, the clarity is magnificent!
4;But this copy is amazing, it recaptures the genuine magic the film had on the big screen.
5;The extras are also pretty spectacular.
6;She gives new info I didn't know, and I'm the biggest Bruce Lee fan on the planet!
7;When I first watch this video I expect a lot of action, but the most exciting fight scenes only come 50 minutes later.
8;Without those two we can see more of Bruce kicking, fighting and flying.
9;For those who like to watch real and pure martial arts I recommend other Bruce Lee films (The Chinese Connection and The Way of the Dragon) or Jackie Chan films (Wheels On Meals or Dragons Forever).
10;Bruce Lee in his last and most explosive film before his untimely death is probably the best and most entertaining action movie ever made.
11;sammo Hung get's in a dramatic fight with Bruce at the beginning.
12;bruce lee is quite possibly the greatest fighter from moses to royce gracie.
13;the action is incredible .
14;i dont know what people were saying about this one back in 1973 but the real deal it is the best old school martial arts film .
15;it would definately rate really high on a all time list too.
16;This movie is so dumb, but yet, it's still good.
17;Either way, you'll probably enjoy this one.
18;A true epic of its time.
19;This is Bruce Lee at his best!
20;It has a James Bond like plot, but the martial arts is excellent.
21;This is definitely a must for all Bruce Lee fans.
22;Still the best, in spite of getting forty years old!
23;Ten words are enough to describe my experience with this item.
24;This has always been my favorite Bruce Lee movie.
25;Now you can slow down the action and see just how amazing Bruce's speed was in real time.
26;The greatest martial artist ever.
27;A classic action film that made Lee an International star.
28;Lee's stunts and choreography are amazing.
29;For the age of this movie, it looks great.
30;I was extremely pleased with the price as well.
31;By far the best of all his movies.
32;The story is a bit campy, but the action more than makes up for it.
33;The final fight is by far the best EVER on film.
34;If you at all like karate movies, this is the one for you!
35;The film looks Awesome in Blu.
36;If makes the film that much more enjoyable.
37;any Intelligent person that knows their Fighters in History.

40;If you like James Bond without all the gadgetry that bond needed to get himself out of trouble, you will enjoy this movie!
41;If you want to see the real superman in action, see this movie!
42;Enter the Dragon is a pure gold Bruce Lee classic.
43;They go to Han's fantasy island for the great tournament.
44;A beautiful British blonde tempts the three young men with a harem of beautiful lasses.
45;There's plenty of kung fu fighting.
46;As a martial arts movie, it's excellent.
47;It's one of Bruce Lee's classics.
48;The definitive copy of Enter the Dragon for any Bruce Lee fan.
49;The movie itself looks as good as it ever has.
50;The interviews are excellent throughout.
51;it's basically Enter the Dragon, plus all the actual Bruce footage from Game of Death, and all the documentary you will ever want to watch.
52;This movie gets the adrenaline pumping.
53;Excellent story, Excellent acting EXCELLENT fight scenes of REAL kung Fu techniques.
54;this truly inspires you to take up Kung fu and Nunchaku's.
55;While some of the dialogue seems somewhat hokey, 25 years later, this movie still boasts some of the finest displays of martial arts skill seen on film.
56;Lee's spectacular fight with the guards in the subterranean chambers is, in my humble opinion, the single greatest martial arts battle ever filmed.
57;I've watched Enter the Dragon and other Bruce Lee films so many times, but this one never gets old.
58;With all the extras included, this is a great deal.
59;ordered on the day of the release as promised.
60;Still, this will always be in my collection and a go to movie for inspiration.
61;Movies are of course best viewed uncut and preferably in a movie theatre.
62;The next best thing is seeing it at home on a really good home theatre system.
63;And that goes double for an action film.
64;In any case, Enter The Dragon is the ultimate marital arts film and remains the ultimate showcase for the legend that is Bruce Lee.
65;Days before the viewing, he'd constantly tell me how awesome the movie was, most specifically for Lee's fighting prowess.
66;So, I expected something amazing.
67;projectors and have the master, the legend of Bruce Lee punch, kick and spin nunchakus inches away from you.
68;Certainly this classic will be viewed far into the future, and those later generations will no doubt be as thrilled as I was watching it over my high school buddy's on a grainy tape.
69;There have been bigger, more colorful and perhaps even faster martial artists on film than Bruce Lee.
70;But no one has yet to capture his mystique and with Enter The Dragon, he leaves a legacy to martial arts fans and movie fans that is unequalled.
71;There is some cross referring, as a lot of these documentaries and commentaries have been individually released previously but this is a great complete package.
72;however, it was nice to see a classic movie filmed 40 years ago that everyone praises.
73;This Movie is the best martial arts movie of all time.
74;Bruce Lee , the fastest and greatest fighter to ever walk on planet earth !!
75;The most diciplined,physically fit and most dominate martial arts teacher,fighter and trainer in world history !
76;A wonderful box set full of extras !!
77;I grew up watching this movie and all of it's imitators.
78;If you are a fan of Bruce Lee or Kung Fu movies this is a must own.
79;Bruce Lee is a martial arts legend and icon.
80;Enter the Dragon is a martial arts movie legend and action icon.
81;Before you look at the rest, start with the best.
82;Donnie Yen is a Bruce Lee fan and have studied Bruce since his youth.
83;Enter the Dragon and Bruce Lee's talent has stood the test of time.
84;Check out the Best then check out the rest.
85;The Movie was packed well and is completely as ordered.
86;TheReal reason I am happy to have this is the Director of this Movie.
87;robert Clouse, and I used to work togetherin Hollywood many years ago.
88;(we were with CBS TV at the time) The movie itself is one of Bruce's great onesand has a great cast.
89;Anyone who likes Kung Fu movies will have a great time watching it.
90;Bruce Lee was a great martial artist but what he wanted to be was a great actor.
91;As they say in Hollywood, he had a tremendous screen presence.
92;I remember reading an interview with the film's director Robert Clouse.
93;All goes well in the tournament until Lee finds his evidence and is himself discovered in the process.
94;We are then treated to a long series of truly excellent fight scenes.
95;bruce Lee fans are a perfect example.
96;some Bruce Lee lunatics start their reviews by saying that the opening fight is a brilliant sequence of moves.
97;Bruce will typically engage in a series of one.
98;hit exchanges with his opponents while mixing in a few three.
99;If you think that the beginning fight in Enter the Dragon is brilliant, then you need to watch the Wu Jing/Andy On exchange in Fatal Contact (2006) for an example of a truly scintillating martial arts fight with combinations and countermoves executed with great speed and precision.
100;In all honesty, I thought it was good and entertaining, with a bit of welcomed variety in terms of weaponry and moves.
101;The sheer variety of that scene easily overpowers anything Bruce Lee ever did.
102;If you still think the Bruce Lee scene was better, please look under Psychiatrist in your Yellow Pages.
103;The fact still remains that we have an incredible martial artist in middling action films.
104;The best movie ever from Bruce Lee.
105;Always using a true wisdom and care
106;Enter the Dragon is considered by many to be the greatest martial arts film ever.
107;There were and are a hundreds of martial arts films way better than this movie.
108;The only thing that brought excitement to this movie was Bruce Lee.
109;Bruce's charisma and film persona leaped through the movie screen.
110;He could make a home movie and make it a classic (Oh!
111;The only reason this movie is a cult classic is because Bruce's fight choregraphy in this film was probably his best.
112;extras and bonus features include documentaries,trailers,T. v. spots,and more.
113;this is Martial Arts Legend/Icon Bruce Lee's final,last,completed,major film,and his best.
114;if you love martial arts action adventure,I highly recommend this film classic!
115;Pretty much at the same time, also retain the whole atmosphere and look of the movie with a real story, at least some of it, going on.
116;I want to see Bolo Yeung versus Bruce Lee and then add more sinister champions to make Enter the Dragon a highly enjoyable kung.
117;It's a fact that Bruce Lee created an iconic performance in Enter the Dragon, but it is also a fact that he is just better when it comes to martial art display, and that's it.
118;The scenes with him doing the karate moves, especially of his visually awesome fight with O'Harra, are breathtaking to watch, and that's the only best parts of the film.
119;Of course, Bruce is funny (for me to eye.
120;Easily the most memorable part of the film is the final showdown, especially in the hall of mirrors (8,000 of the mirrors used!)
121;That's a great piece of film making.
122;I couldn't help but notice the amazing array of animal abuse during the film, especially on birds and snake (which actually bit Bruce Lee).
123;All in all, Enter the Dragon remains a well.
124;good information about Bruce Lee and his life.
125;It had lots of extras and is FULL of interviews and behind the scenes!
126;The only way to describe this movie is as the greatest Martial Arts film ever.
127;The plot and script are excellent for an action movie and Bruce Lee shines.
128;The final battle in the mirror hall is one of the cleverest and most exciting action sequences i've seen.
129;womderfull, after so many years it is still a clear, clean, colorful well played movie!!
130;It's a classic that you can enjoy again and again, and also to listen how they made it!
131;for the other bonus materials, i recommended the enter the dragon featurette as it showed hw the movie came about with rare footages of the sets and fliming process.
132;the tv spots, theatrical trailers are also very entertaining as it provided a peek as to hw this movie was promoted back then in the 70's.
133;lastly for the movie, i felt tt enter the dragon is the most accessible bruce lee's movie for the non.
134;n who can forget the fantastic coliuseum finale where bruce duel with Chuck Norris?In conclusion, this special anniversary edition of enter the dragon is a steal.
135;This entertaining mix of James Bond espionage and great kung.
136;fu staged by the martial arts master Bruce Lee.
137;While the ridiculous dubbing, plot and Bruce Lee's acting are campy, the fight sequences are the real star in this movie.
138;Great action sequences and martial arts.
139;Spectacular Martial Arts and a star vehicle for Bruce Lee.
140;A landmark inside its genre
141;fu movies and a great action movie, but not much else.
142;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
143;the transfer itself is the citeria that the review should be judged on, which in this case is done quite well.
144;it is interesting that for an outdated film like Enter the Dragon, it's character depictions, plot and fight choreography are most often duplicated by today's style of martial art movies.
145;I was really looking forward to Enter the Dragon on Blu.
146;Bruce Lee and John Saxon are great martial arts performers.
147;there's a lot of fighting action in this movie.
148;It has a great plot ofsuspence building up to a grand climax at the end.
149;True heroe's of the screen.
150;The scenery of China is awsome and the action scenes with the head master changing hand weapons is quite unique.
151;The whole trip there looks completely authentic.
152;The VHS tape was ok but this is great.
153;Right from the very beginning with the spiritual discourse between Lee and the master (when the opponent expands, I contract, when he contracts, I expand
154;This movie shows Bruce Lee in top fighting form and also reminds me that he was a fine actor as well.
155;Some of the cinematography is very interesting too and I'm glad others noticed the similarity to the old James Bond flicks.
156;I think the musical score has something to do with that.
157;He was truly remarkable and seemed to be getting better all the time.
158;After over 40 years, this is still the Best Martial Arts film .
159;mainly due to the fact that Bruce Lee had a true Director's/ cinematographer's Eye, in terms of staging awesomely exciting, amazingly fluid, and intensely explosive fight scenes!
160;And of course, he also had the personal incredible conditioning and real martial arts expertise to produce genuinely authentic results!
161;The supporting cast is also excellent (especially Jim Kelly) .
162;and Lalo Schifrin's Music Score is top.
163;This really is one of the best 'action' films ever .
164;hasn't lost it's 'edge' even after 40 years!
165;It's also the best action movie that's ever seen the light of day.
166;(Note: the featurette is good, watch it the first time.)
167;This movie is a classic of any genre.
168;It has such a great dated feel to it like other classic sixties and seventies films such as Goldfinger, Deliverance or Dirty Harry.
169;I love the cast and their interaction.
170;In this film everyone is treated with equal respect.
171;It's pretty much a given that Han is up to something.
172;where this movie shines is the martial arts action.
173;I originally saw Enter The Dragon as a double feature at the drive in in the early eighties.
174;That is until Bruce Lee came on.
175;The final fight in the house of mirrors holds up well and is every bit as thrilling as any fight scene of today.
176;as for the bonus features, the trailers are interesting if for no other reason then it's amusing to see how far commercials have come.
177;The interview with Bruce Lee is particularly poignant.
178;He had a powerful personality and very definate views on fame and movie making.
179;One of the most iconic films of the genre.
180;A favorite in my collection.
181;Great fight scenes and good story line.
182;Bruce Lee's presence in this film is utterly stunning, as his physical dynamic completely mesmorizes the viewer, and transends into a state of pure spiritual energy before our eyes.
183;His embodiment, emotions and spirit are boundlessly portrayed and demonstrate what one is capable of.
184;Well, this movie had a profound impact on me.
185;Speaking of which, it is amazing to me that until his last breath he never really abandoned that style of fighting, despite all his experimentation and despite founding Jeet Kune Do.
186;now, was this Bruce Lee's best film?
187;Production wise, nothing in ETD can compare with the battle with Chuck Norris in the Coliseum in the climactic scene from Return of the Dragon.
188;Remarkable, powerful and masterful yes, but somewhat past the prime he demonstrated in his earlier films.
189;all in all this film is a classic.
190;It has some of the most brutal and beautiful hand to hand fight sequences ever committed to film.
191;The battles are at once fantastical and savagely realistic.
192;And while Bruce Lee would always add fancy kicking to his film repertoire, many of his techniques here are in fact practical and commonsensical, and would work on the street if executed by a decent fighter.
193;But the greatest compliment I can pay this film is that after having watched it dozens of times over the last 30+ years, I can still watch it over and over again.
194;God, this fine martial arts film was made all the way back in 1973.
195;That's the world this movie is set in (had it just been made a few years later.
196;The film is a fine action packed spy thriller with Lee reruited by the government to go after the very bad man named Han.
197;John Saxon is a great supporting cast member playing Roper, a man who crosses Han's path on his own time!
198;Because the previous transfer was very nice already.
199;A must have for all the Bruce Lee fans.
200;This is perhaps the greatest martial arts movie of all time.
201;Bruce Lee is on top of his game.
202;His lightning fast limbs are on display and the strength of his character and technique are outstanding.
203;I recommend this film to any serious martial arts fan.
204;Enter the Dragon has been a cult classic since it came out.
205;But beware of 'Return of the Dragon'.
206;Bruce Lee became such a huge star from this move and the movies he made in China that he thought he could write, produce, direct, and act in it.
207;still u see this legend slightly clearer, a closer touch to the legend.
208;Bruce Lee was more than legendary and Enter the Dragon was the pinnacle of his career.
209;Some items of note: Bruce Lee coreographed all the fight scenes.
210;Hus unique style, Jeet Kune Do, is featured in the first 5 mins of the film.
211;It's filled with interesting characters, Bruce's philosophy on fighting and iconic imagery.
212;I recommend this movie to fans of Bloodsport and similar films.
213;Bruce Lee spent many hours dedicated to the films smooth running production not just superbly choregraphed fight scenes and script rewrites.
214;Cue great performances by Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly (who said he modelled his character on Mohammed Ali),John Saxon and Shih Kien (whose lines were dubbed for this film.)
215;in Fists of Fury,Mr. lee put on a magnificent show and topped The Big Boss the action and storyline were superb.
216;that topped the Chinese Connection and Enter The Dragon was even better.
217;Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly, 1970's, martial arts, good vs. bad, and some great Bruce Lee quotes.
218;This is one of my all time favorites.
219;It's a good movie, even if it is seriously dated, and it does live up to the  _______.
220;It is just a good martial arts movie with Bruce Lee wisdom to live by in the first few minutes.
221;If you can'd watch it for the entertainment, watch it for the historical influence in the film industry and martial arts.
222;The entire world knows all about the great Bruce Lee and what he gave us as a martial artist and philosopher, not many know Jim Kelly inspired and encouraged many kids in the black community to pursue martial arts, play sports that they loved (his sport being tennis), and their dreams, while encouraging them to be proud of who they were and where they came from (it was the 70's after all).
223;So, regardless of what is going on in life, I highly recommend putting life aside for a minute and enjoy some kickass film.
224;Enter the Dragon is a very enjoyable martial arts themed movie staring Bruce Lee as an undercover agent attempting to bring down a powerful drug lord that also happens to host a martial arts tournament for the best fighters in the world.
225;This is a fun movie action flick that is also a bit of glimpse back at the early 1970s.
226;It was also great to show this to my teen son when he started taking martial arts.
227;stories for most of the important fighters, a good bit of humor, and even a classic bit of revenge, but the the best parts are the fantastic fighting scenes.
228;Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete and this movie highlights his great skill.
229;The acting is a bit over the top, but fits this type of movie well.
230;My boyfriend got me into Bruce Lee and I can't stop thinking about him!
231;some of the best martial arts I've ever seen ever are in this movie right here (and this is before all that special effects stuff).
232;The pristine master is the same than the ones of the former edition, but 3 new documentaries were added.
233;Wing Chun: The Art That Introduced Kung Fu to Bruce Lee gives us precious informations on the Yip Man school, presenting us the sifu Wong Shun Leung, the main instructor of Bruce Lee.
234;Return to the Han's Island is a clip from a former J. Little documentary on the various location spots used in the Bruce Lee movies.
235;And the selection of Bruce Lee goodies straight from the seventies is so fun !
236;Linda Lee Cadwell describes Bruce during his final days and up until 'ETD' was finally edited into it's final big screen debut.
237;This 'ETD' version shows scenes never seen before, especially the opening scene, which displays Lee's remarkable ability to create climatic moves with human emotion and controlled hostility.
238;Great supporting cast that includes, John Saxon and Jim Kelly who accompany Bruce to an offshore island that's controlled by a murderous tyrant who hosts an international Karate Tournament.
239;This is the best martial arts movie ever made!!
240;known Bruce Lee among American actors and featuring a plot of international proportions.
241;there's a great deal of humour in the story, beyond the traditional incompetent henchmen and improbably deft martial arts.
242;makers succeeded in making a film that was more than a simple action outing.
243;Two scenes made ENTER THE DRAGON a classic of cinema.
244;In a scene where Bruce Lee wields nunchaku we are treated to one of the finest documents of athletic prowess, testimony that Lee was not just a simple action star but a great sportsman.
245;The climax of the film, where Lee duels with Han in a hall of mirrors, is rich in symbolism and elegantly filmed, coming to influence many films since.
246;And I personally, a recent visitor to Hong Kong and one passionately interested in the area, enjoyed seeing how Kowloon and Hong Kong Island looked before the boom era.
247;i had a good time watching ENTER THE DRAGON and recommend to any who might be intrigued by a kung fu film that transcends its genre to some degree.
248;art movie that came after this one owes a debt to Bruce Lee.
249;realized vision is pure entertainment.
250;That it happens to be the best martial.
251;even today, these are some of the most realistic fight scenes in cinema.
252;oh yeah, Jim Kelly was pretty good, too.
253;He moved better than John Saxon, that's for sure.
254;And for all the artifical devices, the silly premises (and there are many), it's a wholly enjoyable movie, and smart, if you can believe that.
255;Bruce Lee's acting ability will impress you, and there are hidden gems all over this flick.
256;Like I said, hands down, bar none, the best ever martial arts movie ever.
257;This is Bruce Lee at his best, he really shows how fast(scary fast)he isThe only sad thing about this movie is you can see(WELL DIE HARD LEE FANS ANYWAY) that the man was slowly dying.
258;Enter of the Dragon is an excellent film in it s own right.
259;The sound is better the images is better.
260;Very good movie and the blu ray cersion made it better.
261;The extras are cool too.
262;He commands my attention, I can't take my eyes away.
263;He has the potential to do anything at any fraction of a second.
264;This movie is his American crossover, his biggest film (not my favorite), but a masterpiece.
265;But watching Bruce in action is philosophy in motion, truly a movie that will haunt me with its greatness my whole life over.
266;I am a true Bruce Lee devotee.
267;He wasn't an actor, he was a fantastic human being.
268;A human who made the impression of a dragon's soul inside a human's body.
269;His life, philosophy, and pursuit of his potential are touching.
270;Enter the Dragon is the first martial arts film to ever be shot by a Hollywood film studio, most notably Warner Bros., one of the greatest and most popular film studios of all time.
271;This film shot Lee to international stardom and became one of the best groundbreaking martial arts epic in film history.
272;This movie is about a man known as Lee, who works as an undercover agent working for Mr. Braithwaite.
273;There, Lee will meet other friends and allies like Williams (played by Jim Kelly), and Roper (played by John Saxon) who is known to bet for money everywhere he goes.
274;line martial arts action, and a riveting storyline.
275;And the music sounds perfect and it fits the movie's atmosphere perfectly well.
276;So in the end, Enter the Dragon is still, and always will be, a true masterpiece, and will continue to entertain Lee fans, old and new for years to come.
277;A true must own for all fans of martial art films !
278;who became a star thanks to this film .
279;I love watching Bruce Lee, as well as John Saxon and a few others.
280;Good movie for the martial artist and martial artist wanna.
281;please read the book by Robert Clouse himself about the making of Enter the Dragon.
282;Ya gotta luv Bruce Lee.
283;This is by far his best film!
284;Enter The Dragon was the first collaboration between an American and Chinese film company.
285;This is the defining Bruce Lee movie of all time.
286;One of the best movies I have seen in years.
287;I'm a Bruce lee Dan and this is one of his greatest movies of all time.
288;I am by no means a fan of the martial arts, but I enjoy and respect Bruce Lee movies.
289;Bruce Lee possessed unparalleled skills, evoked a sense of honor and commitment, and communicated the depth of his feelings and philosophy in each of his movies.
290;Enter the Dragon is a master's true masterpiece.
291;There are acts of savagery committed, some fights ending in the death of one combatant, but the one true savage Lee must defeat is Han, an expert martial artist with a secret weapon.
292;The fight scenes are often elaborate and quite incredible, involving scores of men at times.
293;With multiple images of the two combatants appearing at all sorts of angles, making it all but impossible to figure out where each man really is, the whole sequence is a surreal experience for the viewer.
294;in addition to the movie itself, which is inarguably Bruce Lee's best performance, one also gets bonus material: a short documentary of the making of the film in Hong Kong, an introduction by Lee's wife, and most importantly a documentary of interviews with Lee, in which he speaks eloquently of his philosophy, of which martial arts is the centerpiece.
295;Many of his ideas and teaching are clearly reflected in Enter the Dragon, which only makes the movie more important.
296;This movie alone is a legacy Bruce Lee would be proud of.
297;Considered a classic by many, it's an entertaining American.
298;as a martial arts movie, as U. s. standards go at the time), if only because Bruce Lee's moves are so quick, and has great screen charisma.
299;Although watching it nowadays, there's an entertaining campiness fun with the now cookie.
300;Everybody now like to say the famous Man.you come right out of a comic book line.
301;Bruce Lee's first and only American film, ENTER THE DRAGON is amazing.
302;It has a good plot, and good dialogue and actors, but it's Bruce Lee that makes this picture so enjoyable.
303;His incredible martial arts techniques will blow you away!
304;Still one of the seminal martial arts movies ever.
305;A classic you must have in your collection.
306;This film is a RIOT!
307;fu action flick with some of the greatest martial arts moves ever put on film from the Master himself, Bruce Lee.
308;Lee may steal the scenes with his truly uncanny physical moves, but it is Jim Kelly who burns up the film as Williams with his outrageous polyester funk and his super.
309;It would be a fitting companion piece to this film.
310;you come right out of a comic book!
311;A great ensemble cast of characters.
312;I loved Enter the Dragon.
313;Its definetely one of the greatest martial art films of all time and its also my favorite Bruce Lee movie so far.
314;If you like martial art films, you will definetely like this one, with out a doubt.
315;Loved this movie, never gets old trully the best of bruce lee's collection.
316;Fast delivery and excellent packaging.
317;Enter the Dragon is truly the one film that really throws out all the punches,thanks to an incredible performance by the legendary Bruce Lee.
318;a man who will always be remembered for his dedication and hard work throughout this spectacular epic.
319;compared to other martial arts films of the 1970s,Enter the Dragon tops my list and I really enjoy seeing this film.
320;i really wish this film was rereleased on the big screen because Enter the Dragon is such an incredible film that it desreves all the respect it has recieved.
321;enter the Dragon is really one great film I really love.
322;stick with the video or better yet,the 25th Anniversary Special Edition.
323;i highly recommend watching this in widescreen.
324;Watch this movie to see the master at work.
325;Enter the Dragon is a superb legacy of Bruce Lee's spirit and achievement.
326;A classic for any collection a must have for any Kung Fu or martial arts fan RIP Bruce Lee:(
327;I think that all Bruce Lee films are the greatest.
328;But it shows the other fighters with their women, and it shows a couple women's breasts, and some bare butts.
329;other than that, this movie is great!
330;It's obviously one movie you must have!
331;Wished they were all as good as this one.
332;Bruce Lee is the one everyone else copied and wanted to be like.
333;He is so fast and powerful the human eye cannot see his moves and Bruce was a perfectionist and did more for the martial arts than anyone in history.
334;Anyone who compares Bruce Lee with today's action.
335;One of my favorite Bruce Lee movies.
336;The Lee family is a favorite in my home.
337;This is the best martial arts movie ever made.
338;Bruce Lee is the greatest martial artist to ever live and this is his best film.
339;If you are looking for a great martial arts film this is it.
340;this is the most important and entertaining martial arts flick of all time!
341;That's what impressed me the most with this movie.
342;This is the classic martial arts movie of all time.
343;This is the best martial arts movie ever.
344;Not the best fight scenes, that title goes to return of the dragon or chinese connection, but overall the best ever.
345;This is just one of my favorite movies for reasons too numerous to name.
346;for instance the opening fight scene has Bruce win by submission technique.
347;roper and Williams are also delightful and fun characters.
348;worth the price of admission just to see Bruce Lee demonstrate the Art of Fighting Without Fighting.
349;Enter The Dragon is what martial arts movie making is all about.
350;bruce Lee is so fun to watch both in terms of his fighting and philosophy, that Enter The Dragon becomes an enjoyable experience no matter what decade you watch it in.
351;Aside from Lee, Enter The Dragon also features stars John Saxon and Jim Kelly, and lets not forget to mention a young Bolo Yeung who went on to become everyones favorite villain in many martial arts movies in the 80's/90's.
352;the story to Enter The Dragon was original in its time.
353;Han holds a tournament and Lee enters.
354;the action is excellent for this movie, after all it has Bruce.
355;There are plenty of action scenes both in and outside of the tournament, mainly featuring Bruce.
356;if you are a true fan of the martial arts, Enter The Dragon is must have must own material.
357;It is so well made for its time, that today it is still easy to watch in all aspects.
358;this is worth the price alone.
359;but then you have all of the extras and pretty much every.
360;When, I bought this I thought disc were two individual guess not.
361;Bruce Lee possessed a certain sense of charisma unlike anyone else I've ever seen.
362;Just based on the number of times the plot from this movie has been copied you know it has to be amazing.
363;A rare mix of excellent martial arts action and a good plot.
364;Bruce Lee is a likable protagonist, the villain is obviously evil.
365;The part that makes the movie interesting is the number of grey characters who are neither.
366;I think it was then I realized the scope of his appeal.
367;but the movie itself is a classic.
368;This will be a great beginning.
369;, I just love the film.
370;socky, Enter the Dragon made quite a splash on its release in 1973 as a fast.
371;One of the most notable features of old 70s movies is their slow pace.
372;The man is actually a gem.
373;Even the name is excellent.
374;after a bit of intrigue and snooping around the island we finally .
375;The action sequences are pretty decent.
376;But what really marks them out is how amazing BL looks without a shirt.
377;pumping method stars can easily imitate.
378;These guys sometimes stomp on each other, but all you actually see is the winner from the midsection up.
379;The other thing that makes the fight scenes truly memorable are BL's battle squeaks of Wuuuuuuuuuuu.
380;cart phone (and the restrained comedy of the golf course shakedown scene is excellent, by the way)
381;A must for martial arts fans and cultists.
382;Another fine movie, however, which fans may wish to check out is the entertaining Game of Death, which, incidentally, has the added bonus of accounting for the origin of Uma Thurman's jumpsuit in Quentin Tarantino's recent masterpiece Kill Bill.
383;This movie has been a classic for as long as I can remember,since I had first seen this movie in the Drive in almost 40 years ago.
384;amazing choreography Lee helped withsuch an amazing actor and person Lee is and always will beamazing plot as I saidamazing characters portrayed throughout the moviequite a spectacle to watch on screentruly a great action movie.
385;this one was right for having it.
386;worth the watch every time.
387;he really kicks some ass in this movie.
388;time fans of Bruce Lee are well.
389;the storyline, featuring Lee infiltrating a martial arts tournament sponsored by a Chinese criminal warlord in Hong Kong, is pulp fiction at its best.
390;the real draw of the movie when it was released in 1971 were the dramatic martial arts action sequences.
391;Lee choreographed the fight scenes, which feature himself and a number of other experienced martial artists, along with real actor John Saxon (who had enough martial arts training to look respectable in his fights).
392;over commentary is worth listening to
393;string with respect to production in Hong Kong.
394;Enter the Dragon was easily Lee's best movie!
395;There is action all around and unlike some of Bruce's other films, all of the actors with speaking roles actually speak their own lines (unlike Chinese Connection where everyone sounds like George the Animal Steele).
396;I have always enjoyed Bruce Lee movies.
397;He was exceptional in his techniques!
398;I enjoyed watching his son, sad that his life ended so suddenly.
399;It is amazing how well this film has held up over the years.
400;This movie is a classic and I enjoyed watching it again.
401;Bruce Lee fired up the Kung Fu craze of the seventies and this is, hands down, the greatest Kung Fu movie ever.
402;It looks fresh and new on BR, and is a fast moving, fun movie.
403;My favorite Kung Fu movie ever, even including Ip Man and Fist of Legend.
404;One of the best Bruce Lee movies ever!
405;Enter the Dragon is an excellent movie starring Bruce Lee.
406;I first watched the movie as a young man over twenty years ago and I have seen it several times ever since and I thoroughly enjoy it all the time.
407;the storyline is simple and straightforward enough.
408;From this is created a first rate film that is full of action and excitement.
409;this is the best film by Bruce Lee.
410;There is excellent fighting which is a treat for lovers of martial arts.
411;One can see why Bruce Lee is the legend that he is.
412;No one has been able to match his skills, charisma and spirit.
413;Incidentally, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung also make an appearance when they were still relatively unknown.
414;as a bonus, you will also get a very interesting 30 minutes documentary on the making of Enter the Dragon with some new and rare footage.
415;all in all, a skillfully crafted film with amazing acting.
416;This is close to perfect as it gets.
417;This was a true treat!
418;I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan and this is the best I've ever seen him!
419;This movie is the best martial arts movie ever.
420;It captures the power and the spirit of martial arts.
421;There is a nice tribute to Bruce Lee too.
422;This is definately a Bruce Lee fan's as well as a martial arts fan's dream come true.
423;Movie was excellent and here in a fast and timely manner.
424;The movie itself is one of the best I've ever seen.
425;In fact, this is the best martial arts movie ever!!!!!
426;The action/fighting sequences and story line are pure classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
427;This movie was a staple for me in my younger years and it still holds enough appeal to keep me coming back.
428;There's footage on the net that shows even more lost footage from Game of Death.
429;I'm sure there is even more rare and unseen footage that the Lee estate is sitting on that fans would love to see.
430;Part of that is due to the additional footage which delves into Bruce's philosophy.
431;Let me make it clear to all you Lee fanatics: Bruce Lee was NOT a good philosopher.
432;the real draw of Bruce is his physical ability.
433;There are moments of excellence though, such as when he faces off against Bob Wall (Ohara) and his speed is incredible here.
434;But I found myself picking it apart more than usual this time around.
435;Bruce is still captivating and there are moments of glory.
436;Bruce plays a highly skilled and spiritual martial artist who goes to the tournament of Han to avenge his sisters death and resort honor to the Shaolin Temple which Han betrayed years earler.
437;jabbar, James Colburn, Danny Inasoto and Linda Lee Caldwell (Bruce's widow) among others.
438;It also has two features focusing strictly on ETD and a very touching introduction from Mrs. Caldwell.
439;It also has a rare interview with Bruce in which he ends it with one of his legendary quotes.
440;Overall, this is probably the best package for Enter The Dragon that has been released and probably ever will be released!
441;This should be required viewing for anyone that calls himself a martial arts fan!
442;anyway, this movie is highly recommended!
443;If you are at all a Martial Arts fan see this film.
444;The best fight scenes ever recorded, beating anything Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and even anything else Bruce Lee ever did.
445;A very good Martial Art's film, with one of the best, Bruce Lee.
446;All of what made Bruce Lee famous is in this movie.
447;His screams, poses, and unique style of fighting keeps the movie so interesting for all who watch it.
448;And it also being on Blu.
449;This film was one of my favorites.
450;Just love old Bruce Lee movies.
451;So happy I found it.
452;I bought this for a friend and he loved it.
453;He's a big Bruce Lee fan so I thought I would surprise him and he loved it.
454;It's a classic being Bruce Lee's last film and one of the more familiar to US audiences.
455;I enjoyed the intro boat scene which was shot in Hong Kong and gives viewers a small glimpse into Chinese culture.
456;One of the best movies ever made as well as being THE best martial arts movie.
457;The extra features such as a short interview where you really see Lee's deep sense of what martial art really entails, home video of a Lee workout, and trailors make this even better.
458;Enter the Dragon is reminiscent of a 70s Bond film combined with elements of the Bruce Lee films, with many amazing martial arts duels.
459;The film's slow pacing really enhances, rather than hurts, the film's build up to an intense, action.
460;sure, there's a little cheesiness, but fine performances, intense martial arts, and an interesting plot make this an intriguing, remarkable classic.
461;Mr. Han (Shih Kien), who sits there with many of the diabolical James Bond villains, has a mysterious island laced full of beautiful women, faithful servants, secret entrances, exits and traps and plenty of other gadgetry.
462;Han has a special delight in power, greed, and inflicting pain on others, and has the sinister laugh down pact.
463;bruce Lee's shines in his final film, as he has a charismatic air about him, intelligence and a street smart toughness to not fall for Han's traps.
464;We all love seeing Lee kick butt in martial arts showdowns, and in this film we see a climactic showdown of showdowns, but in Enter the Dragon is fun to watch him play spy, infiltrating the trickiness of Lee's island and his various secret rooms.
465;Jim Kelly, who starred in many other kung fu films, brings an air of slick street coolness to his role as Williams, and has some unforgettable and clever lines when confronting Han.
466;This is one of the the greatest(if not the greatest) martial arts movie ever made.
467;While I am a fan of those types of movies, Enter the Dragon stands in its own category.
468;Bruce shows us his style in this movie.
469;He felt many martial artists focused to much on making techniques look good that many neglected physical training to make simple techniques effective to end fights.
470;Bruce lee is the best action hero in kunfu movies of all others.
471;No one can top his speed and strength
472;I really enjoyed this film because it was a lot more than just a martial arts flick in which the plot was just an afterthought to surround the fighting scenes like most martial arts films then and even now.
473;The scenes were pretty brief because as Bruce himself has mentioned, the real.
474;life fights are never drawn out and lengthy as the fastest one who strikes first is almost always the winner and Bruce shows just how fast he is in his fight scenes.
475;His fight with Bob Wall was quick, efficient and deadly and is realistic.
476;This film also made Asian Kung Fu films well known and popularised them in the West and so for that reason alone this film is worthy of respect.
477;great film, great sound and special features but perhaps you should go for the Blu.
478;ray version of this great Bruce Lee film is certainly worth the double.
479;Bruce Lee will always be the best, but this blu ray release doesnt have any extra video footage that we havent seen before in other releases.
480;d image) then you'll definitely want this.
481;I got this exactly when I needed it to give as a gift.
482;I think the colors are remastered because they look vivid and great, especially in the bonus when they show clips of the old film you can really tell how you would not want to watch it if it were not.
483;what I really love are the bonuses, especially the interview with Bruce Lee himself, interview with his wife, documentary of Bruce's life history and the death of Bruce Lee and his son Brandon.
484;Interviews with people that worked with Bruce also confirms all the great things about this Legend and some more.
485;i have gained even more respect for Bruce Lee after watching the film plus the documentaries and interviews.
486;The 40th anniversary edition of Enter the Dragon on Blu.
487;All in all, you're getting a lot of video separate from the main feature itself, which is great.
488;Especially the lenticular print image of Bruce Lee with the nunchaku.
489;It's a really cool addition.
490;ray, it's a really good deal considering all that you get.
491;Every time I introduce this old movie to a friend for the first time, they always get fascinated.
492;Bruce lee's creative and outstanding performance is highlighted in this extraordinary movie.
493;What sets Bruce a part from all of the rest is his character energy and his extraordinary power and speed from such a small framed man.
494;Now that Enter the Dragon is in Blueray, it is sheer pleasure and excitement as on the big screen!
495;After watching all 5 Bruce Lee's movies, Enter the Dragon had to be the best.
496;Lots of action and great fight scenes.
497;I have watched this one over and over and love it.
498;It is a must for all martial arts fan.
499;First to use real martial artist as villians in fight films.
500;First to do a arm.
501;anyway, this movie was easily his best film and was his launching pad to post humorous super stardom in the US.
502;Enter the dragon, great action and a variety of kung fu star action scenes with brilliant fight scenes by lee.
503;Enter the Dragon is THE greatest martial arts movie of all time.
504;I know it's great to be green and help the environment, but come on, they could have done better for Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee fans.
505;The package comes with a red envelope with a iron.
506;It comes with post card sized photographs of all the memorable moments from the movie.
507;It comes with one of the original premiere tickets that says Ally of the Dragon.
508;The best goodie that comes with the package is a hologram/lenticular that shows Bruce Lee during the nunchuk scene.
509;I just hope Bruce Lee's family, like Linda Lee and Shannon Lee are benefiting from this release.
510;Simply the best martial arts film ever made!
511;bruce was in the finest shape of his life.
512;a quintessential fighter who demonstrates an incredible skill!
513;he would have made many more fine films I'm sure!
514;Bruce Lee's final movie before his untimely death, Enter The Dragon, is also the first movie in which I saw the legendary father of Eric Draven.
515;choreographed fight scenes by Mr. Lee himself.
516;Mr. Lee really knew his craft and it's on full display here, particularly in the fight inside the island fortress.
517;And the climactic fight is, in my view, a subtle nod to The Phantom Of The Opera by Gaston Leroux.
518;See this film for everything else I mentioned, but above all, for Mr. Lee's performance.
519;With the fantastic exhibition of his life.
520;I dream what would have come next up.
521;Jim kelly was such class.
522;John Saxon cool and still around to tell the tales.
523;It will make me go Ape!
524;I really enjoyed the content as well as the speed that i recieved the merchandise thanks
525;Amazing, first of all, something that called my attention is the envelope with some stuff of enter the dragon.
526;the bonus clips are amazing.
527;The fight scenes are amazing.
528;All the pretended cover for chasing a criminal who deals with narcotics is a huge frame to show us one of the most admirable Kung Fu fighting in the story of the cinema.
529;We will assist to a petrified island with an important footage in the first minutes where the master and Bruce Lee talks about the spiritual doctrines of the Kung Fu: interesting dialogue that pitifully is not longer.
530;We will watch interesting duels with John Saxon, Jim Kelly and Bolo Yeung the same who fought in the first great feature of Van Damme sixteen years later Lee gives us the best of his discipline, with impressive domain of his flying attacks and the use of wood weapon.
531;the final combat between Hahn and Lee will be in the mirror hall, a great homage to Orson Welles' The Lady of Shangai.
532;ray is better than I had expected.
533;Overall, great product and I'd recommend this movie to any martial arts fan.
534;Love this movie, I like the story, the acting and the action.
535;It is awesome to watch a gifted man like Bruce Lee.
536;Only Bruce Lee had the combination of all three coupled with great screen charisma.
537;Segal, Van Damm, and Chan are pale shadows next to Lee, who had the soul of a philosopher, the mind of a visionary, and the speed and strength of a dragon.
538;Bruce Lee was the greatest martial artist ever, and I think this was his best film.
539;The martial arts action is excellent in this movie.
540;Bruce Lee's match against Bob Wall is one of the best fight sequences filmed.
541;The only other fight scene that compares is Bruce Lee's fight against Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon.
542;even the other stars, Jim Kelly and John Saxon, are adequate, though we'd much rather see Bruce.
543;Also, the choreography is more realistic than the others, with the possible exception of Return of the Dragon, which was entirely choreographed by Bruce Lee.
544;The movie is notable for Bruce's fight with Kareem Abdul Jabar and also his nunchaku fight with Dan Inosanto, Bruce's training partner.
545;The source print is very good and I didn't see any flaws.
546;It also has extensive interview with Bruce and original trailors.
547;The fight scenes, location, action, etc., make all other martial arts movies pale by comparison.
548;To give you an idea, the year Enter The Dragon was released, it was Warner Brother's top grossing film.
549;If you want to be entertained by the greatest martial artist who ever lived, check out Enter The Dragon.
550;(The movie is so good I gave it 5 stars twice!)
551;The plot is decent but the action scenes with Bruce lee steal the movie.
552;classic noises is pure action fun.
553;The only scene worth to watch in this one is Bruce's incredibly fast backhand when he competes with Bob Wall.
554;Otherwise its a bad martil arts movie and doesnt even compare with Way Of The Dragon, Bruce Lee's best.
555;Could have teach us all how to enjoy and respect life.
556;Although the movie is dated due to technology and the standard story, Bruce Li always makes the film fun to watch.
557;ray version worth the money.
558;Great 40th anniversary edition of this iconic martial arts masterpiece.
559;A nice upgrade in picture and sound will keep fans very happy.
560;Some interesting new extras and fun packaging make this a must.
561;The fight scenes have a serious mood about them, especially Bruces.
562;For the many people who I'm sure have seen the film, the one flashback scene featuring the great and very underrated Angela Mao.Ying as Bruce's younger sister shows what a really tough and skilled fighter she is.
563;This tis undoutably one of the best martial arts movies ever made.
564;It shows the master Bruce Lee in action.
565;It also shows his skills with weapons and his physical conditioning.
566;The other stars are very good as well.
567;This is the best, hands down, martial arts flick ever.
568;This is the ultimate martial arts movie.
569;If you are a martial artist like me, or just love watching martial arts movies, you will more than likely enjoy this movie.
570;This was for my husband who is a huge Lee fan, he was very happy.
571;I know he will enjoy both of them.
572;The movie is powerful, the box it comes in doesn't feel cheap and my dad loves it which is fantastic!
573;A good sold clear display.
574;If you want to see a piece of movie history with excellent fighting scenes choreographed by Bruce himself this is the one.
575;Has an excellent video transfer and a good sound not the best sound possible, but an excellent movie to see.
576;this is the best movie of bruce lee, where he shows something about his philosophy about fighting, and the documentals are very interesting, its almost unreal the things he did,
577;It's a fine offering, long overdue, and considering the reasonable price, really offers a lot of nice extras, though most of them have been available elsewhere and have therefore been seen before (at least by rabid fans like me).
578;to start with, there is of course the movie Enter the Dragon (ETD) .
579;The plot is simple enough .
580;But the real point, or value, of this movie is that Bruce Lee shines throughout with his incredible fight sequences .
581;This was totally innovative and amazing in 1973 as the first ever martial arts movie made in Hollywood and despite all the subsequent copycats and modern day wire.
582;a newly produced documentary short that includes some rare and new footage .
583;These are both decent films, with Warrior's Journey a real gem with the GOD footage .
584;and so, what we have here is by far the best available version of ETD that now exists and probably ever will, complete with a lot of nice extras, most of which have been available elsewhere.
585;bruce lee's whole legend was really born with this great action movie that just happens to have the best kung.
586;the action is done with a flair(the legend says that bruce directed the action),and if you like bruce this is his best role and the best way to see his power on screen.
587;Dragon breathes fire for purely one reason: the riveting presence of Lee, whose personal charisma and particularly ferocious brand of martial arts made him an international star.
588;style thriller, part Hong Kong chop.
589;socky extravaganza, Dragon was Lee's last film, and quite justifiably his most popular.
590;turning highlight, as is the scrappy brawl between real.
591;But the film's climax, a harrowing confrontation between Lee and the deadly, claw.
592;fu classic into an extravagant Asian treat.
593;the movie that resulted is a showcase for a man who pushed the limits of his own physical abilities beyond all boundaries, for the sake of expressing and exhibiting himself to the world.
594;The magnetism and talent of Lee in such well choreographed fight scenes is simply unparalleled.
595;As always though, Bruce Lee comes to life in the fight sequences and shines through all pretenses, making this movie a prototype and classic of the highest caliber, creating a standard for all western martial art movies that follow in it's wake to live up to.
596;this 2 disc edition boasts a new 30th anniversary digital transfer and includes a wealth of bonus materials.
597;It would be nice to have the option of viewing those scenes separately.
598;This is Bruce Lee's finest film.
599;The colors and picture are crisp.
600;bruce written,directed,and choreagraph most of his movies.
601;You got everything here, exotic locations, cool characters, hot women, and a whole lot of Kung Fu Fighting.
602;He holds karate tournaments once every three years.
603;To find new talent to help him with his world wide drug and prostitution rings.
604;He had a small role in this flick, but he was as scary as he always is.
605;Of course as Bruce begins fighting them, that's when all the guys in the prisons are released and everybody gets in on the fun.
606;Enter the Dragon(1973) is a classic, action.
607;packed, kung fu movie produced by Warner Bros. and Golden Harvest in Hong Kong.
608;This film made Bruce Lee an international movie star.
609;Lee gets help from sexy, secret agent Mei Ling(Betty Chung).
610;Lalo Schifrin's Enter the Dragon music score is lush, colorful, and energetic.
611;Director Brett Ratner is a fan of Schifrin and he hired him to write music for the Rush Hour movies.
612;Enter the Dragon gives us authentic Asian culture and stereotypes of it.
613;The late Robert Clouse did a decent job directing the film.
614;Enter the Dragon borrows ideas from James Bond movies and 1940's pulp comic books, but the film works thanks to Bruce Lee's participation on the film.
615;There's two nude women in Williams' room!
616;Bruce Lee shows some grace with the kung fu fights that he staged for Enter the Dragon.
617;Enter the Dragon(1973) was one of the most enjoyable movie made in the 1970's.
618;This is without a doubt the greatest martial arts film ever made (sorry Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fans.
619;as great as that film was, this film is still better).
620;Enter the Dragon is the perfectly paced martial arts film that keeps the story simple and the action fast.
621;All other martial artists/filmmakers should take notes, this is how it is done!
622;most original and better than the new age computer kung foo fakes.
623;good to see if you are wanting to learn more about martial arts.
624;I can't even begin to describe how much I love this film.
625;Enter the dragon is the best movie i ever seen.
626;if you are a real Bruce lee fan you will get it.
627;ray movie but it still looks great.
628;For heaven's sake, it's Bruce Lee's best.
629;By far the best Bruce Lee movie.
630;The fighting is amazing and there's some funny moments to enjoy as well.
631;Very much a movie from the seventies but still good.
632;The story really drives this film (in it's originality) and the actors are all truly amazing
633;The transfer is astonishing for its age (I love how grand it feels as the airplane flies overhead in the opening .
634;this film has some wonderful shots.
635;It's also a nice way to just have a good time when you're in the mood for a classic action movie!I love this film and have viewed it multiple times.
636;he really was an amazing talent.
637;i highly recommend this film.

639;Without question Enter the Dragon is the best Bruce Lee movie out there.
640;Enter the Dragon is essentially a kung.
641;Unlike when you see a Jackie Chan movie where he has his own team of martial artists to help authenticate the fight scenes.
642;When I ordered this, I thought I was getting the movie along with the additional information about Bruce Lee and the making of the film.
643;But it was just a documentary featuring Linda Lee.
644;My Dad is going to love this when he comes back to visit in Dec. 2008.
645;My son said Bruce of course, so I said lets have a history lesson.
646;Classic good digital color and sound.
647;enjoy martial arts fight sequences?
648;This comes with collector's items each of these looks fantastic.
649;Compared to todays karate films, this is one of a kind!
650;Its' got serious action, and drama on screen.
651;One of Hollywoods best M. a. films ever made.
652;Everybody on this film were perhaps ahead of their time.
653;This movie I have always thought was his finest effort and showed the more thoughtful introspective side.
654;The original scene with the shaolin,priest was cut out but it really gives you some of his thoughts on Zen and Fighting.
655;Its great that it was put back in.
656;The speed and power was evident and this is a great movie with a great story.
657;I've never seen this film before and I enjoyed it for what it was.
658;I'm in Tae Kwon Do and my instructor loves Bruce Lee, so that was my initial reason for watching the movie.
659;Bruce Lee's life was taken over 30 years ago but his spirit still lives on in his films.
660;packed with Bruce Lee kickin'!
661;I first watched this movie when I was about 9 now am 15> and thought it was amazing.
662;The last part prooved the best with all the mirrors.
663;It was a great illusion.
664;bruce Lee's fighting technique is very unique that you can't distinguish it from reality.
665;Frankly, he's a lot better than Jackie Chan.
666;Bruce has this concentration that when he starts fighting, every move he makes is perfect.
667;The setting was very cool, really ancient.
668;i enjoyed this movie a lot.
669;If your a Bruce Lee fan or just a fan of martial arts you have to have this movie, I'm glad I finally got my copy.
670;It's a pleasure to watch the graceful way Bruce Lee just walked onto the set and that's before the expertly choreographed fight scenes.
671;I was 8 when this movie came out, and this was my first time seeing it.
672;I really enjoyed the way the film was shot even though we have better filming techniques today.
673;Bruce Lee's performance and even his physical abilities are simply amazing to see.
674;It is a true classic.
675;It was sent to me in great condition for a good price, and of course the movie is a classic!
676;This movie was the best brucelee flim I ever watch.
677;this movie was a master piece.
678;it is a action packed movie.
679;If you want a good movie withaction you want this film.
680;americans of all stripes embraced the artistry of martial arts and many turned to Zen and other Eastern philosophies.
681;Actors like Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan and Jet Li owe their success to Bruce Lee.
682;eNTER THE DRAGON is remarkable as the first Hong Kong martial arts movie fully backed by American investors.
683;There is much splendid martial arts talent exhibited in the film.
684;and they do, even to this day.
685;Lee, physically, was impressive, slender, compact man with wiry muscles and fearsome coordination.
686;It is a classicThe price was great and it has arrived on time.
687;it was like the excitement of watching this movie for the first time.
688;That simple little detail blew my mind.
689;This movie will be enjoy by generations after generations.
690;still considered one of the great movies that he directed and starred in.
691;all his movies showed the dedication to the martial arts and he definitlely was ahead of his time.
692;this movie is still rated as his best, and will be for sometime.
693;This movie displays much of Bruce's talent, philosophy, and style.
694;An excellent story, excellent production, and the best martial arts in history.
695;You see brandon Lee and hear his wife.
696;And there is a nice long production consisting mostly of Bruce's one and only broadcasted interview where the master himself gives insight into his unorthadox style and amazing philosphy.
697;This is a great release.
698;I'm glad that I got the 2007 version because it includes one more awesome documentary than the re.
699;He would have easily been the biggest star in Hollywood.
700;This is by far his best.
701;I loved the late Bruce Lee and all of his movies.
702;I still think he's the best martial artist there ever was.
703;Enter the Dragon was missing from my collection and I'm happy I was able to get it.
704;I think it is a good film with good fight scenes.
705;I think the it looks good.
706;I saw it when I was 12 and then just enjoyed it with my 12 year old boy.
707;I had some pretty high expectations from this movie on blu ray and it went above and beyond when I put the disc in and turned out the lights.
708;My husband and I have always liked Bruce Lee movies, even the ones with terrible dubbing.
709;This one was in much better condition and we were able to enjoy watching it a lot more.
710;I was impressed with this transfer to Blu.
711;Resolution was great, although colors and detail not as vivd (due to reproduction from old film).
712;lee, John Saxon, and Jim Kelly star as the intrepid threesome of fighters who travel to the evil Han's island stronghold to participate in his annual martial arts tournament.
713;With supporting martial artists such as Bob Wall, the redoubtable Bolo Yeung (who always deserved to be more famous than he became) the movie sports plenty of great fight scenes where Lee literally takes on dozens of assailants as well as the duels during the official martial arts competition.
714;But if you're like me, the actual story was just filler, with the real fun being getting to watch all these great martial artists, many of whom were still in their prime, show their stuff.
715;Lee posseses and ellegance and grace that isn't found in most martial artists.
716;Enter the Dragon, takes Lee at his best and puts him in a big budget film with a good cast.
717;Even the plot is fairly good(though kind of a rip off of Dr. No).
718;What the people will really see the movie for is Lee and he delivers as always.
719;Bruce Lee has a lot of philosophy stuff going on too.
720;The greatest martial artist who ever lived.
721;Chuck Norris, the former Karate champion, even admits how great Bruce Lee was.
722;Bruce Lee's most popular movie ever made and considered by many to be the best martial arts movie ever made, PERIOD.
723;All of them owe Enter the Dragon their success.
724;When ENTER THE DRAGON was first released in 1973, viewers tended to see it mostly as a flashy breakthrough vehicle for martial arts star Bruce Lee.
725;It was certainly that, but thirty years later one can also see that it was a genre defining film in much the same way that Marlon Brando was to motorcycle movies in THE WILD ONE.
726;Instead, Lee wisely used his screen persona, his sexuality, and his ultra.
727;The interest, however, is set squarely on Lee's fighting ability.
728;Sharing the spotlight is a set of notable secondary characters.
729;Jim Kelly is Williams, one of the first super.
730;Further, when Lee applies the coupe de grace to Wall, the look on Lee's face shows an almost sexual climax intensity that emphasizes the new direction that he was taking martial arts films.
731;images of both Lee and Han are incredibly riveting as the viewer cannot distinguish the man from the image.
732;defining film that it was is that it combines all the right big scenes of group and individual combat with memorable quips of philosophy.
733;I've watched pretty much all the bruce lee movies I can find and this one is one of the good ones.
734;It has some cool special effects for that time.
735;The only reason this gets 3 stars instead of 1 is because Bruce Lee is so talented.
736;NO stranger to Bruce Lee fare, I still marvel at the movie each time I see it, including the first time I saw it in 1973, the year I graduated from high school.
737;After watching more movies and studying Lee, I can see that what was on the screen was real.
738;Enter the Dragon was so great my children memorized it scene for scene, and I still watch it when I can.
739;First of all, take note of Jim Kelly's role.
740;quick, intelligent and uses that one of a kind face inflection to make it clear that he is not to be messed with.
741;Bruce Lee was a phenomenal martial artist and an amazing man.
742;If you at all appreciate martial arts, you will love this movie.
743;The Martial Arts battles (coreographed by Bruce himself) are all excellent, particular the final battle involving mirrors.
744;Noone can even compare to Bruce Lee and his fighting.
745;the action is plentiful, some comedy too.
746;Anyways, I love the movie, and the special eddition is cool.
747;He kicked that one guy so hard, you had to be there!
748;This would have to be considered the all time greatest Bruce Lee movie.
749;from here on there is nonstop karate action.
750;This is definitely Bruce Lee inhis finest hour.
751;The use of special effects in this movie makes it that much more exciting.
752;You will definitely rate this as one of the greatest all time karate movies.
753;Jim Kelly was also good and John Saxon shows some passable martial arts skills.
754;The final fight sequence in the maze of mirrors shows some spectacular directing and camera work.
755;Bruce Lee is the best karate actor.
756;I have watched the movie about 50 times and I continue to watch it and enjoy it.
757;Refreshingly clear and pleasing to watch.
758;A must see for Bruce lee fans.
759;This version also includes some extra footage that was very Important.
760;a classic superhero fighting machine.
761;the best all time bruce lee movie ever.
762;great fight scenes and excellent story line.
763;This movie rules ,as we all know,but what makes this new special edition even better are all those bonus goodies included.
764;any Bruce Lee fan will love it.
765;look at the bright side,at least this much footage surfaced,and all of us LEE fans can be thankful for it.
766;overall, I am very happy with this product!
767;And, there are so many great one.
768;liners in Enter the Dragon (especially those belonging to actor and martial artist Jim Kelly).
769;but Bruce Lee was and still is the king of the Hong Kong martial arts action movie genre, and this is his crowning achievement.
770;ray version obviously got a lot more attention, care, and cleanup.
771;It is by far the best looking and sounding version I've ever seen of the movie.
772;It sounded great, if not a little over the top.
773;some of the signature grain of the original is still there, but the images are much more crisp and sharp than any other version.
774;I am a huge Bruce Lee fan and have been back to 1971.
775;The film is worth owning of coarse, just due to the fact of so few films, and that he shines when on screen and does his amazing martial arts magic unique to him.
776;It is worth the price just for his action scenes in this film.
777;It's time for anothe great series like this one.
778;One of my all time favorite movies.
779;With some great performances by abou 10 great fighters or so and a couple of bruce against the world fights, this is you classic case of a classic movie.
780;The end fight could have been better, but a great movie overall.
781;This is probably the best film bruce lee ever made.
782;His other films for the most part were low budget and only served to show his skill as a martial artist but this had a much higher production value.
783;It was done in english not dubbed, it had great audio, and outstanding martial arts choreography.
784;This is very well done martial arts film that captures the original idea of tournament fighting.
785;This is a movie that everyone should see, even if you aren't a Bruce Lee fan.
786;If Bruce had lived longer, I think that he and John Saxon could have made a good sequel to this film.
787;If you enjoyed Enter the Dragon, you should also enjoy Game of Death.
788;Bruce Lee shines in this action.
789;As with most martial arts movies, the fight scenes are the best parts, but in this film the supporting cast are exceptional.
790;John Saxon and Jim Kelly provide light relief from the intense atmosphere, and Shih Kien sizzles as the menacing Han.
791;Apart from this, all is good, especially Bruce's anihilation of O'Hara and the brilliantly choreographed final fight in the Hall of Mirrors .
792;Of all his movies, the one that always stands out is Enter the Dragon.
793;On the other hand, story, acting and character are not really what matters in this movie
794;by no means a great movie, Enter the Dragon does succeed on the level it aspires to, and in its own way, it is a major film in its genre.
795;I LOVE my NEW Enter the Dragon 40th Anniversary Blu.
796;This is one of the best action movies of the 70s so I highly recommend it.
797;I love this movie so much.
798;I was born a year later, but still like it so much.
799;Bruce Lee was a man with a magnificent talent.
800;That's an excellent trick, even for Loki.
801;enter the Dragon is an excellent movie.
802;i saw Enter The Dragon 36 times in 1973 I was 13 years old.
803;Sure this movie is a classic but lets face it.
804;Needless to say he was very happy with his gift.
805;adds, in my opinion to its greatness.
806;His legacy has changed and influenced martial arts and action films that followed this one.
807;I includes additional documentaries I have seen before as well as new special I have not with athletes like Sugar Ray Leonard speaking on the influence Bruce Lee had on them.
808;As for the film, it has never looked better and the special features are worth the price.
809;The WC documentary is brief but the commentary by Sifu Dave Peterson is informative and entertaining.
810;bruce Lee is and will always be the main distributer of martial arts.
811;when het kicks and all, the sounds etc. that's reallllly cool.
812;very nicely reproduced using digitial technology!
813;The artmartial sequences are amazing, Bruce is getting better and better as an actor.
814;but technically is still an inferior movie, a kind of B. class movie, and only die.
815;This new release is quite a good treat, especially for Bruce Lee newly fans as it contains Enter the Dragon movie (1973), A Warrior's Journey documentay (2001) Curse of the Dragon documentary (1993) all in one 2.
816;discs special edition is the Blood Steel .
817;The making of Enter the Dragon documentary.
818;Bruce is just so unique captivating).
819;I've loved this film since I was a little kidlet and it almost felt like seeing a brand new version of it.
820;This is just one of those films that always tears it up for me and this Blu edition is absolutely fantastic.
821;Enter the Dragon is a martial arts masterpiece.
822;Must have movie for Bruce Lee fans.
823;As the customer, I was very satisfied with the deal.
824;I thought this movie was one of the best martial arts movies ever, BUT you could tell that Bruce Lee was EXTREMELY nervous about his impression on the American audience.
825;It seems Lee's goal was to enthrall the entire world, but, being a natural born American citizen, he seemed especially intent on making this movie work.
826;he IS a legend, and legends just can't live in the present.
827;He accomplished all he was allowed to, and we're all extremely grateful.
828;enter the Dragon is one of the best!
829;if you like a good action movie this is the one!
830;This is still a martial arts classic!
831;Even though the acting is horrible and the narrative is typical of most martial arts films where vengeance and honor are restored to one's family, this film will remain a classic for years to come.
832;It's a great one, with Bruce Lee at his finest.
833;ray brings the movie home like you've never see it before, and the extras that come with it are marvelous.
834;Highly recommended to any Bruce Lee or martial arts movie fan.
835;This is an amazing movie.
836;It's fight scenes are hands down amazing!
837;I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend.
838;He absolutely loved it so two thumbs up.
839;Probably the best known of Bruce Lee's films, this one has a great cast of supporting actors who were skilled martial artists in their own style.
840;lot's of great action and a great display of Bruce's unsurpassed skill.
841;This is one of the best remastered films I've seen.
842;of course, I feel it is the greatest Martial Arts film ever made, why?
843;Because Hollywood took notice (finally) of Bruce Lee's talent, not only being the greatest Martial Artist of the 20th century, but very savy in designing the fight scenes.
844;This is still one of the best martial arts movies ever made.
845;It not only introduced America to martial arts, but set the bar for martial arts movies with a story.
846;This is one of my go.
847;release this film with a better audio track and improved picture.
848;picture:much better than ever before.
849;there's some nice, natural film grain goin on throughout.
850;skin tones are fresh and vivid.
851;lines are strong and crisp.
852;well, then, get this and hear them yourself.
853;dialogue is clear and audible.
854;time favorite marital arts movie!
855;Enter the Dragon showed Bruce Lee in his prime in a 007.
856;The transfer to Hi Def was smooth and the sound is great!
857;This movie also featured the late, great Jim Kelly.
858;Even after watching this movie over 30 years after it hit the movie theater, it's still a great hit.
859;Every sequence is worth watching over and over again.
860;ray disc that i have bought.
861;There really is that much more detail and smoothness in the images.
862;Its a great showing for a 30yo movie.
863;There is also a great deal of documentaries and extras if you dig that kind of stuff.
864;Most anyone looking at a review of this already knows what it is.
865;I was very impressed with the color and crispness and the audio surprised me as well!
866;Enter The Dragon is simply the greatest martial arts movie ever made with the greatest martial artist to ever live.
867;With his charismatic personality and superhuman skill, Lee is such an amazement to watch.
868;Bruce Lee is a true legend who was way ahead of his time and died far too young.
869;However although he may have died young, he still managed to change the world of martial arts and cinema forever.
870;Great Bruce Lee movie to watch!
871;This is a wonderful movie for your psp.
872;It is definitely Bruce Lee's best film.
873;Contains great martial arts action, good story, and some humor.
874;It is quite violent and intense at times and contains brief nudity and some drug use.
875;Lee eventually uncovers the operation, gets to the only radio that's on the island and calls the military to come to the rescue.
876;Lee, with help from others, eliminates Han and his entire group of fighters.
877;But this is still a great film to watch if you're traveling on a train or long car ride.
878;You will get the best sound with a good pair of headphones.
879;this havs to be the best version i have seen
880;I got this blue ray as a christmas gift for my brother who is a huge Bruce Lee fan.
881;I was suprised he didn't have it yet, so he love it!
882;Bruce Lee fans young and old will watch his films repeatedly for years to come.
883;this double disc has several compelling documentaries that examine Lee's life and skills.
884;A special treat is previously unseen footage of Lee in action.
885;disc Two includes John Little's feature length biography Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey with a meticulous reconstruction of Lee's intended cut of The Game of Death.
886;I love Bruce Lee flicks and this is a must have for any Bruce Lee enthusiast.
887;There are so many extra bonuses and content for a collector to enjoy.
888;It works perfectly, I may get more of these movies as gifts for friends and family members, who also love bruce lee, so better stock up
889;If you looking for a good Bruce Lee movie get Enter the Dragon.
890;The first time I saw it I loved it.
891;It's in English and it is so sharp.
892;The other Bruce Lee movies are good but not as good as Enter the dragon.
893;The others are dubed in and the pictures are not so good but Enter the dragon is the best!!!!!!
894;Wife had never seen a Bruce Lee movie so I had to show her this one.
895;This video is great to own in that there is a bonus disc which focuses on the life and career of the starring actor, Bruce Lee.
896;the bonus disc has a special feature which documents his life as well as his son Brandon's.
897;whilst working on The Crow and the resulting said film was released the next year as a tribute).
898;It was for my boyfriends xmas gift, he loved it.
899;Loving this special edition of Enter the Dragon!
900;The best Bruce Lee movie of all times!
901;The fight sequences are amazing!
902;Highly recommend it to everyone.
903;The best movie that Bruce Lee every made, and even includes scenes that were cut from the original when the movie was first shown.
904;Is still a classic in the martial arts realm, but is a good movie for anybody to watch.
905;has a good plot, action, and good writing that would have made a hit in the movie theatres today.
906;is a great gift for the martial arts fan.
907;If your a fan of Enter the dragon then this is A Must to own edition.
908;Filled with extras that will be more than entertaining, it gives real insight into the mindof the most recognized name in the world of martial arts.
909;Beautiful print of the film, love the bonus extras.
910;I highly recommend this for any Bruce Lee or martial arts fan!
911;The film clarity is perfect, which is to be expected of course.
912;It may be of interest to note that, the 2 American actors mainly starring alongside Mr. Lee, are champion martial artists as well.
913;So, that makes this the greatest American kung fu movie and also, the best one from Hong Kong.
914;This is a landmark film and unless, you can find it in a full collection of Bruce Lee's movies, this is what you want.
915;Every so often a genius of kinesthetic flow arrives in the world
916;I feel safe in saying that there is no other martial artist put on film that has such dynamic presence and amazing focus as Lee
917;Starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon and new.
918;the film is laced with Lee's Zen philosophy of life.
919;He uses martial arts as a metaphor for all of life and a vehicle in which to understand all of life's big questions.
920;This film is Lee's final masterpiece as the Little Dragon died 6 days before the US release of Enter the Dragon.
921;This film is a testament to an amazing human being that managed to bridge the gap between East and West.
922;arts film, Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon (1973) is comic.
923;book escapism on a grand scale.
924;Robert Clouse received credit as director, but there's no doubt that Lee handled the terrific action sequences.
925;Though unoriginal in terms of scripting, Enter the Dragon represents Lee's finest 90 minutes on screen while featuring some of the best martial.
926;It remains a spectacular swan song to his brief career.
927;Hopefully, Warner will reissue Enter the Dragon in its original version.)
928;fu spectacle,the definitive Bruce Lee.
929;many memorable scenes,including some great fights,and those over.
930;top Bruce Lee squeeking and screeching sounds!
931;(2.35:1),the picture is superb,considering the films age.
932;the sound also is superb,i heard no background noise,hissing,or distortion problems.
933;to truly appreciate this film, you have to remember when it was made, and then you have to look on the impact it had.
934;Enter the Dragon was intended to be the film that would introduce Lee to an American audience.
935;It was made in Hong, but the film is in English and it was directed by an American.
936;On top of that, the film features an established Hollywood star (John Saxon) to make the movie easier to market, and it also features Jim Kelly, a black fighter, who fills the Blaxploitation role that was popular in many American films in the seventies.
937;The movie often draws comparisons to James Bond films, probably due to the simple plot and the over.
938;If your a fan of the genre, it's easy to see the influences this movie had on many of the movies that would follow, including famous American directors like Quentin Tarantino.
939;Most importantly, it brought attention to the genre that led to more films (and stars like Chan or Li) making it to the US.
940;If you're a big fan of Bruce Lee, you will probably enjoy watching them, although they probably won't be of any interest to a casual fan.
941;my dad's b day present and one of my all time favorite movies!
942;Admittedly, Bruce Lee supplies the best fight scenes in the film (the one featuring ex.
943;The film also has cameo performances from some very big name performers before they became internationally.
944;known: Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung are the three I noticed.
945;bruce Lee is great to watch, not just as a supreme martial artist but also for the anatomy lesson he provides.
946;top cool cat performance of Jim Kelly and his afro, to the funky wakka.
947;And when contact is actually made, enormous thwacking sounds accompany it.
948;i found the panoramic scenes of karateka training to be very interesting.
949;the version of the film I saw includes a behind.
950;I enjoyed watching Lee teach his infant son how to do kicks, but could have done without the syrupy aggrandizing of Lee's wife.
951;Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly, Jonny Saxton, Bob Wall, Chinese Hercules all were great in this seventies classic.
952;Enter the Dragon is a 5.
953;It combines the best aspects of its genre in its period and sets a standard for future martial arts pictures to come.
954;It is surprisingly well directed, a point which is often overlooked, with wonderful pacing and visual composition, and a wry wit.
955;Yeah baby, the one and only martial arts master of them all.
956;and with this landmark film made the year of his untimely death,Lee has entered the realm of legend.
957;movie looked great with good action sequences, believable storyline, villains and good sound, visuals.
958;This is probably one of the best chop.
959;Pauline Kael obseved that it's a fun example of the entertainment of shlock art.
960;The picture (2.35:1 widescreen), while a little dark at times, is phenomenally sharp and a whole lot clearer than any previous video or TV version I've even seen.
961;The incredible sound is almost perfect.
962;There is a fitfully informative commentary by producer Paul Heller and writer Michael Allin.
963;on side two, there is an amusing 1973 documentary Location: Hong Kong with Enter the Dragon .
964;plot is ok but it is the fight scenes that are amazing.
965;Why they chose John Saxon for this movie I'll never know, but the story line is good and Bruce is top notch as always.
966;For those of you who didn't know it, Jackie Chan makes a brief appearance in one of the underground fight scenes.
967;This was an Amazing movie even if u, like todays actions it is still a good movie.
968;Bruce Lee is the master of Martial Arts and it shows in this movie.
969;For fans of Bruce it is nice to have so many special features on one double.
970;Enter The Dragon is in a class all its own.
971;This man is a genius!
972;He does have a faithful following, and I believe this collection will make you realize why.
973;Super deal , price wise , and of the Movie.
974;bye far the best movie ever bruce lee is the greasted and will be missed.
975;thanks to his family for allowing us to cherish his work for many years to come
976;This movie is my favorite of all time, and we will never see another person come close to Bruce Lee.
977;Great movie from Bruce Lee.
978;This is one of the best movies which Bruce Lee made during his career.
979;It's one of my Bruce Lee movies.
980;Part history and part entertaining.
981;It's fun to watch again and again.
982;Enter the Dragon is the king of all kung fu movies and stars the greatest film martial artist of all time.
983;It's a perfect blend of Hollywood and Hong Kong action cinema.
984;the fighting sequences, though lacking some of the realism of more recent films, were beautifully choreographed.
985;His artistry was as mesmerizing and graceful as any ballet dancer's.
986;the story itself is quite entertaining yet very cliche, even for the early 70's.
987;best fighting force in Han's employ.
988;He is a cunning, (seemingly) intelligent man of means who could have used his talents to make legitimate money, but has, instead, dedicated his life to grabbing power by any means necessary.
989;Almost comically, he wears a monochrome (black) outfit, is surrounded by beautiful women, has various claws that can be attached to the end of his arm (where a hand used to be), even has a little cat he likes to stroke as he talks about his evil plans.
990;in spite of the cliches, Enter the Dragon is a great action film.
991;What this movie does best, showcasing a martial arts master's skills, it does better than any other movie before or since.
992;Simply put, it's a classic.
993;The bonus material is so good it is more interesting (though not necessarily as entertaining) than the movie itself.
994;This is a great product.
995;I ordered it for a gift and was happy to have it arrive on time.
996;It's worth the upgrade if you are a fan.
997;A great way to start your collection of Bruce Lee's works, and one you will enjoy for many years to come!
998;Great movie, well worth the money and I enjoy watching it over and over again.
999;I love Enter the Dragon!
1000;Its the 40th anniversary of this movie A must for all Bruce Lee fans also this Is the last full movie Bruce Lee made and I believe its the best movie Bruce Lee is the king of the martial arts.
1001;I am so happy to have this on Blu Ray.
1002;Either way this is a movie that made history and is a must in anyone's collection.
1003;Enter the dragon, Lee's best and last full movie.
1004;Plot thrives and action flourishes.
1005;The only american made Bruce Lee film and the best thought out.
1006;This is a classic movie, a must see for anyone.
1007;But a friend told me I had to watch Enter The Dragon.
1008;So onto the Netflix queue it went.
1009;that's a lot to look past, but this movie does a great job serving up some really sweet fights.
1010;The rough cinematography actually works in favor of the film as there are some scenes where you totally feel the power Bruce Lee brought to the table.
1011;His skills are presented in amazing clarity, and it makes me understand why Bruce Lee fans object to the slicker cinematography of today (even the stuff that I don't see as slick must seem like it is to them).
1012;It deadens the spirit of the films to cut it.
1013;The spirit of the martial arts is definitely here, Lee's presence is awesome and smashes through all issues you might have, and his skills are so strong that you can easily see why he became such an iconic figure.
1014;I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and I would consider checking out some of his other films which is surprising given my feelings going into Enter The Dragon.
1015;See Enter The Dragon On blu.
1016;But over all this is a great!
1017;the best of the Martial Arts Movies of that Era and the Best Movie done by Bruce Lee.
1018;i have a lot of bruce lee's work but this is his finest hour.
1019;the plot and the movie have the best script and the supporting actors are very good.
1020;it also had the best cinematology, great locations.
1021;Enter the Dragon (ETD) was the last completed film of legendary martial arts expert Bruce Lee.
1022;It was Lee's dream to achieve international success and it is of extreme irony that he did not live to see all his dreams fulfilled.
1023;Lee's screen presence is undeniable only surpassed by his phenomenal ability as a martial artist.
1024;His battle with the guards in the under ground dungeon is extraordinary as Han so aptly observes.
1025;ETD is directed by Bob Clouse who actually does a good job freeing up the surroundings so that Lee has plenty of room to strut his stuff.
1026;All of the fight sequences were staged and expertly executed under the direction of Lee.
1027;A testament to this is that 30 years after it's initial release ETD can still hold it's own next to the more special effects driven features like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Kiss of the Dragon.
1028;In the climatic scene of ETD Lee exacts revenge on Han in spectacular fashion.
1029;Bruce Lee's battle cries are monumental to movie history and his fight with the guards was EXTRA.
1030;See how hard he kicks Han's head!
1031;This is the best home video/audio presentation of this movie.
1032;This 2007 version of the blu ray has A Warrior's Journey which is not just an excellent documentary of Bruce but it contains the recovered sequence of The Game of Death lasting about 30 minutes, an absolute treat.
1033;If you enjoy Bruce Lee's presence and his work and you have held out until now, then you have a real bargain on your hand.
1034;Immensely popular in Asia, Lee believed that his new film, backed by Warner Brothers, would be his crossover vehicle into the mainstream American film market.
1035;Released after his death, Enter the Dragon achieved worldwide acclaim, and Bruce Lee was elevated to almost mythical status by his legion of fans across the world.
1036;Choreographed by Lee, most of the fights are short and sweet.
1037;Making a clear case, for the effectiveness of concentrated and focused action.
1038;And the action is spread around among all the actors.
1039;Lee does not hog the fight scenes, letting the anticipation build, making his scenes really special.
1040;The battle with the guards was magnificent, to quote Han.
1041;The final contest with Han in the room of mirrors may not be completely logical, but it is visually stimulating, and an interesting technical achievement.
1042;Enter the Dragon is a classic in the genre, and should be part of the collection of any martial arts fan.
1043;This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed again and again.
1044;Bruce Lee put everything he had into this movie, but never got to see it on the big screen.
1045;If you like martial arts, this movie is the grand daddy of them all in my opinion.
1046;I've been a fan of Bruce Lee since the 60's and I'm so glad he was able to show the US what the rest of the world knew back in the 1970's that Bruce Lee was the best martial artist ever.
1047;This movie shows all his amazing moves and proves he was and always will be the best in all forms of martial arts.
1048;If you're a fan of Bruce Lee this is a must have blue ray.
1049;This being Bruce Lee's last movie ever makes it awesome to have.
1050;It is great Bruce Lee action.
1051;This is a piece of history.
1052;Bruce Lee was The Dragon, Bruce Lee was the greatest martial artist ever!
1053;His technique better than every GREAT martial artist there is: Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Billy Han, and Tommy Lee.
1054;Not only is Bruce Lee quick, well, he's awesome.
1055;Bruce Lee is totally awesome.
1056;There are even several espionage scenes that end up in mind blowing fights.
1057;This movie never lost my interest for a minute, and from this movie I learned of who this mighty Bruce Lee was and why he was the best of the best.
1058;Every moment just draws you in more and more.
1059;Without a doubt in my mind this is the greatest martial arts movie ever made!
1060;I saw this movie several years ago and I loved it.
1061;This is a great movie.
1062;It is a tribute to the greatest martial artist ever.
1063;Not only is it one of the greatest martial arts films of all time, it's star is one of the greatest martial artists of the 20th century.
1064;Lee is in true form, taking out opponents with amazing speed and power.
1065;The movie itself is well.
1066;acted, and the plot is semi.
1067;believable, if not a bit cliched.
1068;Also, the final battle sequence between Han's warriors and the black clad prisoners is real.
1069;most of the movie is outstanding.
1070;The detail of the good shots is outstanding.
1071;edge image throughout the entire film.
1072;we all know this is a great movie.
1073;fine, we get a lot of this on Blu.
1074;It will take you several evenings to finish it all.
1075;If you are even slightly interested in documentaries or history, you will find much of the additional material interesting, especially the interview with Bruce's Wife.
1076;Considerable time was spent removing film artifacts and making sure the colors were bright and rich.
1077;The final fight scene, in the hall of mirrors, which is so well.
1078;known its almost popular mythology, is ingenious and intense.
1079;Its undeniably rousing and imaginative.
1080;I seen it years ago but didnt remember it well, I then seen it again for the second time all the way through.
1081;I liked the story line a lot on here.
1082;Good all the way through.
1083;Kind of starts off slow, but has to introduce the story line for the first 30 minutes or so.
1084;Bruce Lee is one of the best.
1085;The fighting scenes in this movie are excellent.
1086;Where he fights Oharra I think his name is, one of the best scenes.
1087;He killed him, good stuff.
1088;Bruce Lee was ruthless and took everyone out, which was the best from him.
1089;Check this movie out, the best.
1090;In the interview Bruce discusses alot of his personal philosophies and his life, which is a real treat.
1091;The other extras are quite nice too.
1092;For such a low price you really get a well.
1093;oh by the way, this is one of Bruce Lee's finest movies.
1094;I highly recommend this movie to any with interest or interested in the Martial Arts.
1095;This is by far, Lee's best movie, not because the fighting scenes are the best (they aren't
1096;as opposed to all of his other films.
1097;the plot and acting and actors are actually.
1098;The story is interesting as well.
1099;Lee's most awesome fight scenes are his action scenes in Return of the Dragon and Chinese Connection.
1100;The picture is better than ever and it's mixed in 5.1 surround.
1101;A masterpiece in it's own right, Bruce Lee delivers his most personal film.
1102;This film deserves repeated viewings and the bonus material is actually worth watching.
1103;Well worth the price of admission!
1104;The legend in one of his legendary movies.
1105;Thanks for having it available.
1106;From sheer intensity to charasmatic cool, Lee was able to convey more emotions in a simple glance than most actors could with a series of lines.
1107;John Saxon and Jim Kelley are also awesome as Americans on the island as part of the tournament.
1108;(You can also see Kelley in Black Belt Jones, but not much else) While the plot isn't as thick as, say, The Usual Suspects, it still has enough story and depth to make it more than just a simple action movie.
1109;And, of course, Lee's great fighting and acting ability, plus some great characters, make for a great movie going experience.
1110;This was a great movie, not only was the film clear but also had great fights and a true demo of Bruce's skills.
1111;This movie remains one of my favorites.
1112;The movie is excellent for being as old as it is.
1113;Lee delivers an awesome performance in his last feature film.
1114;I would recommend this film to any action or martial arts enthusiast.
1115;What makes this movie so great?
1116;Bruce Lee is not just an actor or a sportsman
1117;The fight in the room of mirrors is one of the best episodes ever.
1118;I have enjoyed every moment of it.
1119;This is a must to see movie for everyone who enjoys martial arts and actions.
1120;Probably the best Martial arts film ever made.
1121;But in this addition the additional dick with the interviews makes it even better.
1122;Jim Kelly and John Saxon are also very good in this film and of coarse Bruce at his best.
