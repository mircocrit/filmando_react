1;I still watch it and it still makes me laugh.
2;It's one of the greatest comedies of all time.
3;Groucho, Harpo and Chico, real brothers and real funny!
4;An incredibly funny film, Groucho and the gang are really at their best here along with their old foil Margaret Dumont.
5;Like seeing an old friend after a couple of decades or more.
6;if you're a fan, worth watching.
7;One of the greatest comedies of all time, A Night at the Opera is one of those films that just doesn't get stale.
8;In this case, it's the wild and wacky world of opera.
9;But all you'll care about is that it's fun to watch!There's a reason that, after seventy years, this film is still as popular as it is.
10;Many have argued that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is the Marx Brother's finest film, pointing out that it combined the best of the Brother's comedy with the biggest and boldest in MGM production values.
11;This is a great movie, regardless with how it compares to the others.
12;On the one hand, it's nice to have some great big sets for the Brothers to clown around in (Harpo's stunt double swinging through the rafters is great), but all things considered, I think I prefer the tongue.
13;still, while I can pick out a few flaws here and there, this is overall a hilarious and fun movie.
14;Much of what is considered classic Marx Brothers material is from this film: the too.
15;new documentary, which features (among other people) co. star Kitty Carlisle, who is amazingly sharp for being in her 90s, and Dom DeLuise, who talks a lot about food and appears to have been interviewed in the middle of making breakfast (no, I'm not sure why he's here).
16;This is mostly a talking heads interview documentary and there's not a whole lot of brand new material or trivia, but it is nice to see some differing perspectives on things.
17;Robert Benchley's HOW TO SLEEP won the Academy Award in 1935 for Best Short Subject/Comedy, and it's certainly entertaining enough.
18;i'm wary of commentaries performed by people who weren't actually born when the film they're talking about was made, but Leonard Maltin does a fine job here.
19;He even gets into the fun, shouting What a twit!
20;For Marx novices, there's a great movie.
21;It is one of the greatest comedies ever made.
22;A very top line item in its day, my tape still performs perfectly and I recommend this VHS without hesitation!As for the movie, what can you say about a comedy classic?
23;It's great, a real treat to be savored each and every time one watches it.
24;Although brother Zeppo is missed (he'd retired from acting to become an agent), I do enjoy handsome Allan Jones as male love interest.
25;Portions of this picture, the stateroom scene for example, were road.
26;Clearly this concept worked, for the motion picture's comic scenes sparkle with perfection.
27;This was their penultimate truly great film, though with their move to MGM and away from Paramount, you can see a plot is starting to take more precedence over crazy anarchic antics, along with supporting players starting to assume more of a role in the story, along with the dreaded romantic/musical subplot.
28;Allan Jones was also the best pseudo.
29;documentary is quite good, but could have been better.
30;"The audio commentary is also nice
31;The Marx Brothers gave me lifelong loves of wild comedy and opera with this film.
32;What a riot!Share it with someone you love.
33;Although I think Duck Soup is the funniest movie ever made, A Night at the Opera is probably each of the brothers at their best.
34;But in this movie, his timing and air are perfectly tuned to insult yet keep just a hair away from the mean side.
35;harpo gives the villains expert come.
36;He keeps the Grouch and Chic chemistry together seamlessly and of course plays wonderfully as always.
37;I was so happy that this movie came in time to give to my husband for a special occasion.
38;This is great movie with so many outstanding scenes that anyone would be hard pressed to pick just one.
39;Well okay, the stateroom sequence is my favorite.
40;Much of it takes place aboard a ship sailing to America, the best scene being where about 50 people try to pile into a tiny stateroom.
41;I rank this one third best after DUCK SOUP and HORSE FEATHERS.
42;Great music"
43;Overall, it is a Must See!
44;It is great to be able to watch a movie when you want.
45;If you have never seen one, start with this one because I think it's the best.
46;Many think this film the best or one of the best the Brothers Marx ever did.
47;It's probably a matter of taste (well, it's certainly a matter of taste), but I think the first MGM comedy by the Marx Brothers is scattershot.
48;Groucho, Chico and Harpo are in top form, and when they're on .
49;The stateroom scene is still funny after 70 years, and the finale at the opera is Marxist anarchy at its finest.
50;Their voices are fine, but the studios of the time were never short of movies with beautiful youngsters singing to each other.
51;A Night at the Opera was the Marxes' most successful comedy at the box office, and probably the most popular film they ever did.
52;"If ""A Night At The Opera"" is more sentimental and romantic than its Zeppo."
53;Many of the Marx Brothers' comic routines were first tried out on the Broadway stage, and the funniest routines, or sketches, were what ended up in their movies.
54;"driven
55;The crammed stateroom take and the wrecked opera are proof positive of this.
56;This is clearly the best marx brothers movie produced.
57;With the assistance of Irving Thalberg producing, it is just an outstanding picture .
58;Because it is one of their funniest films.
59;Because it hits the mark.
60;Yes their other films are funny and entertaining, but this one in particular was always my favorite.
61;filled with funny lines .
62;has all the familiar MB trappings: good slapstick, good and bad jokes and routines, wild scenes, several musical numbers and general overall chaos.
63;This is the film with the famous scene involving a ton of people being stuffed into Groucho's small cabin room.
64;It's more amazing than funny.
65;I also laughed heartily at the finale with Harpo swinging like Tarzan at the opera house.
66;in all, a funny MB film, one of the boys' better efforts.
67;It is just as wonderful and funny as I remember it, and my boyfriend enjoyed it as well (even though he didn't grow up watching Marx Brothers movies).
68;It's the best of the Marx Brothers films.
69;It was the film that received the Studio support few of their films received.
70;This Marx brothers movie, along with A Day at the Races will always be my favorites.
71;Simple slapstick comedy and classic one line comebacks are Great!
72;this movie is a classic for a reason, it is brilliantly hilarious and delightful.
73;that being said, A Night at the Opera is a hilarious and wonderful film, and was the first of theirs to have a more solid plot.
74;line as well as grander production behind it.
75;On the other hand there are probably 3 earlier films I like better than this one, regardless of production value/plot, but Night at the Opera is still undeniably one of the comedy classics of all cinema.
76;Furthermore, there are lots of excellent Amazon reviews which can fill you in.
77;For young people who may not know the team, do yourself a favour and have a look.
78;the stateroom sequence is as hilarious today as it was when it first appeared.
79;Leonard Maltin provides a beautifully paced commentary, confining his comments to suitable background information and the sheer pleasure at the delights on view.
80;I can't help but hope that the cut footage may one day re.
81;An adequate documentary is included, the best of which has clips of Kitty Carlisle Hart who played the romantic lead.
82;Ms Hart was a very elegant elderly woman with excellent memories of the film and its subsequent elevation to genuine classic .
83;this is an good package of a timeless comedy but the print should have been restored.
84;For those of you looking for a great introduction to the brilliant physical comedy (as well as one liners) from the late, great, and legendary Marx Brothers, this film is for you!
85;A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is nothing short of hilarious, as well as beautiful to listen to!
86;help to bring the beautiful opera singer together with her lover, as well as with critical acclaim.
87;What's more, some of the most beautiful and well.
88;Be sure to see it.
89;I have no doubt that you will enjoy it!
90;Generally recognized as their best though I still prefer Duck Soup or Horsefeathers Predictable plot but great execution.
91;Dated but delightful, an important icon in American comedy films.
92;not one of my favorites, but still a VERY funny movie with some of the more classic marx brothers scenes in it.
93;this is the Marx brothers at their best.
94;great fun!keeps you laughing!plays smoothly and has good sound.
95;if you're unsure about Marx Bros comedy, A Night at the Opera is a great place to start.
96;the music and singing add tremendously to this one!
97;This is one of the funniest movies of all time.
98;There are several routines in the film that are classic.
99;Critic, historians and film makers agree, this is the Marx Brothers' best film.
100;Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle round out a delightful cast of distinguished and goofy characters who enhance Groucho, Chico and Harpo as they mercilessly tear into Verdi's Il Trovatore .
101;Although Duck Soup has critical acclaim, I find this one more entertaining as comedy with a real story line.
102;Certainly one of the finest Marx Brothers comedies, which are themselves among the finest Hollywood productions, with script by George S. Kaufmann.
103;The three characters are admirably seconded by Margaret Dumont, the unflappable grande dame, and the great character actor, Herbert Gottlieb.
104;Kitty Carlisle [Hart] and Allan Jones do a wonderful duet ALONE.
105;I laugh every time I see it.
106;Groucho steals the stage but of course that's the best part!
107;This is one of the funniest Marx Brothers movies.
108;The product streamed well over my wireless Roku receiver.
109;It was a pleasure to watch.
110;I had not laughed so much in quite a while.
111;It's amazing how timeless this movie is.
112;Although not my favorite Marx Brothers' movie, it is the perfect introduction movie.
113;If you've never seen any of their movies, this is the perfect one to start with.
114;This is because of the even pace and overall structure and flow.
115;Although the other ones have the best of the comedy, this one had the director and producers to make this a comparatively more organized feel to it, as the others feel like a live Vaudeville show.
116;Highly recommended for anyone looking to laugh through a whole movie.
117;This audio commentary is extremely good.
118;The thing I like best, I guess, is that Maltin loves the film without being blind to its schmaltzy, fake moments.
119;His comments on the big finale are also strong: he mentions the wide shots of the big opera house set adding grandeur and the accelerated editing pace of the cross.
120;This is a movie you quote and that you come backto time after time.
121;I guess that means it's timeless !
122;probably the greatest and funniest movie by one of the greatest comedy teams of all time.
123;One of the best parts is the voice.
124;he provides many insights into the Marxes, the time and the production"
125;The opera finale is the greatest comic scene ever put on film.
126;Economically told with musical scenes that are well integrated.
127;This, the first and best of the team's MGM releases, features more focus on plot, musical numbers and romance than their earlier, wonderfully pure Paramount outings, but the results are still first.

129;balanced romantic subplot (featuring a lovely young Carlisle) complementing some of the team's zaniest antics, including that immortal stateroom scene, and the impromptu baseball game during the opera.

132;Arguably their finest film .

134;writing teams) are (so far) their funniest.
135;(I remember loving all their movies 30 years ago.)
136;Tomorrow morning I'll take a crack at it, though I remember much of it now.
137;I remember (and make the connection between that movie and this) that Harpo had gone from being an innocent who chases girls to a character who gets knocked around a lot by the heavies.
138;On the night debut of Lasparri in New York, Groucho makes a very funny speech before the opera starts.
139;The result: one hilarious evening complete with a baseball game skit, a scenery change during the opera, Lasparri's kidnapping, and Baroni becoming the star of the opera with Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) back in the biz.
140;The Marx Brothers have done their absolute best in this picture.
141;This movie will absolutely satisfy you with laughs from one of the greatest comedy teams ever!
142;This is one of my favorite movies with the Marx Brothers!
143;They are really great in this and the movie is worth watching over and over again!
144;The 1935 comedy A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is a grab bag of a movie that includes physical gags, verbal gags, a romantic subplot, backstage intrigue, an operatic aria, an elaborate dance number, stunts, absurdity, and sentimentality.
145;whose unique brand of comedy is often edgy, subversive, and even surreal and other.
146;These mundane elements are also, surprisingly, engrossing enough to often upstage the comedians.
147;The Marx Brothers, like Jacques Tati, are creators of their own comic universes, and that's where they need to inhabit, such as in the whimsical delight DUCK SOUP, the Brothers' previous film, where their presence is more dominant.
148;With that said, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA does have some of most memorable gags in the Brothers' history.
149;A verbal confusion with Santa Claus, a tiny room cramped with 15 people, mixing opera with baseball, and Harpo's stunts with the ropes are some of the highlights.
150;The original mono audio is fine, save for some age.
151;Both English subtitles and closed captioning are present for the film's dialogs.
152;leonard Maltin provides an engaging and informative audio commentary for the film.
153;He praises the great pantomimic skills of Harpo, and thoughtfully suggests that although he might have been a great silent film star, his talent really belongs in a sound world.
154;He says although there seems to be improvisations, the dialogs are often so intricately constructed that improvisations are often not possible.
155;Driftwood is introduced through the two brothers to the promising Ricardo Baroni and together the four begin a comical adventure of astronomical proportion that brings them fame and fortune.
156;Night at the Opera is a hilarious comedy that contains both slap.
157;stick comedy and witty dialogue that will entertain any audience.
158;In addition, there are a several scenes with interesting cinematography and scene set up that are nothing short of spectacular, which lends support to the films exceptional cinematic experience.
159;Before any knows it, pure pandemonium breaks outs out during this wild and hilarious night at the opera!I love the Marx Brothers, with their goofy and irrepressible humor.
160;Indeed, they are so funny that I succeeded in converting my son into a Marx Brothers fan as well!
161;This is a great movie, one of the funnies movies ever made!
162;Its family friendly and sure to please everyone.
163;We love this movie, and give it our highest recommendations.
164;Always wanted to see this movie.
165;Hilarious from start to finish.
166;A testament to the Marx Brothers legend.
167;"On the one hand I want to say that I think ""A Night at the Opera"" is the greatest Marx Brothers comedy because their peculiar brand of lunacy works better when given a real world target such as Opera than in the fantasy land of Freedonia in ""Duck Soup."""
168;"On the other hand I want to say that I think ""A Night at the Opera"" has more funny stuff in it than ""Duck Soup."""
169;I just want to laugh my head off.
170;but I want to talk about other things now.
171;i think the person who really helps sell this film is Kitty Carlisle.
172;Carlisle and Jones (the only boy singer to appear in more than one Marx Brothers movie) are clearly the best pair to ever take on these thankless roles.
173;"The boys clearly like her and take her seriously, which she does in return, giving ""A Night at the Opera"" a sense of heart."
174;On top of all this, Carlisle and Jones can sing and their duet from the end of Il Travatore is much better than all the sappy songs that the lovers usually sing in these films.
175;Their new producer, the boy.
176;I find myself in full agreement with the two most knowledgeable Marx Brothers fans of them all, Groucho and Harpo.
177;"Both say in print that ""A Night at the Opera"" is the best film they ever made."
178;"Their next hit show was ""The Coconuts"", which Paramount filmed during the day in New Jersey while they performed at night on New York's Great White Way."
179;They did not create their comedy, they forged it before live audiences, seeking shades of nuance or timing by direct experience.
180;In our own time, a rather well.
181;The wonderful Margaret Dumont portrays Mrs. Claypool as a wealthy woman who turns her money into artistic clout and becomes the object of pursuit by both charlatan (Groucho) and impresario (Sig Ruman).
182;"As movie actors go, she sings extraordinarily well, although I would not have cast her as the formidable Leonora in ""Il trovatore"" [note the correct spelling and capitalization, you non."
183;Kitty Carlisle Hart is one of those wonderful creatures whose existence has made the world a better place.
184;When last I caught sight of her, she was as radiant as ever and had become in the real artistic life of New York what Mrs. Claypool had only aspired to.
185;He gets through what are, in fact, the relatively easy portions of the killer role of Manrico with considerable grace.
186;"Jones has just one more, ""Cosi Cosa"", a big song and dance production number filled with comic bits for the Brothers."
187;"finally, the opera:""Il trovatore"" is recognized by opera buffs as simultaneously one of the most thrilling masterpieces ever composed and one of the silliest things ever to be put on stage."
188;This is their joint masterpiece and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
189;This is definitely a movie that stands the test of time.
190;groucho, Chico, and Harpo are at their humorous best as they deal with tiny staterooms on a cruise, poke fun at everyone around them, and make beautiful music.
191;"As much as many people think of them as ""only"" comedians, A Night at the Opera showcases their musical talents."
192;Harpo is a wonderful harpist (and that's where his name comes from).
193;He's also talented at the piano.
194;Chico has good fingers on the piano as well.
195;Where the upper class is sitting quietly and elegant tables, the lower class is singing, dancing, and having a delightful time.
196;earth Italians and poke fun at the black.
197;The Marx Brothers show that good comedy can remain entertaining for decades.
198;The gags fly as well as the Marx Brothers!
199;What makes the movie so special isn't the two lovebirds or the story, but how the Marx Brothers work together and create gags.
200;This movie is Laugh Out Loud Funny!
201;This is a must see.
202;room scene), this is still a terrific film.
203;In fact, to think that that state room scene is still a hoot almost 80 years later!
204;Anyone who's a fan of the Marx's (and even those who aren't) should have a blast with this film and the others mentioned above, what with the charming word play, and the endless chaotic shenanigans that are the hallmark of the boys known as Marx.
205;(Btw, even with all the verbal linguistics going on, I always thought Harpo was the cutest of them all.)
206;A Night at the Opera, the first movie the Marx Brothers made for MGM, is one of their best.
207;Still, the comic moments (including the famous stateroom scene) remain very funny, and there are numerous one.
208;The image is in its original 1.33:1 full.
209;frame aspect ratio, and is relatively clear.
210;The commentary by Leonard Maltin, while having a few gaps and providing little information on the Marx Brothers' earlier years, is fine.
211;There is an entertaining (although somewhat unbeiievable) story from Groucho on a mid.
212;Also included are a trailer and (in an interesting move) some old shorts and cartoons from around the time this film was made.
213;An interesting interview with romantic lead Kitty Carlisle is the saving grace.
214;A Night At The Opera is indeed one of the greatest films starring The Marx Brothers.
215;"The plot moves along at a good pace
216;The actors are well cast and the script shines.
217;They sail to New York with Gottlieb's promise to Mrs. Claypool that his star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) will be a huge financial success.
218;Then Mrs. Claypool will finally look wonderful in the eyes of high society.
219;ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) because he loves opera singer Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) even though Rosa is loved and pursued by star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri himself.
220;The choreography shines in the classic stateroom scene in which everyone crowds into Otis B. Driftwood's cabin onboard ship"
221;This film is definitely the best I've seen of the Marx Brothers.
222;This movie has some firsts to it.
223;It's the pieces themselves that carry the weight of the picture.
224;everyone points to the stateroom scene, and justifiably so.
225;there are many such masterful moments here.
226;It's all madness, and it's all hilarious.
227;But the saving grace, and a real surprise, is the scene where Chico and Harpo take turns at the piano.
228;Chico's deft and subtle clowning is brilliant, and offers a perfect contrast to Harpo's manic performance.
229;It is one of my favourite scenes in the movie.
230;A Night at the Opera is class Marx Brothers, the unique melange of slapstick and machine.
231;gun wordplay that makes you take a breath in between laughs and just exhale an admiring wow .
232;Classic Marx brothers, cutting humor without being offensive, great fun!!
233;Highlights the Marx brothers musical skills and Groucho at his cutting, biting best.
234;He laughed all the way through the parts that contained the Marx brothers.
235;these guys are classic comedians.
236;This is simply one of the greatest comedies ever made.
237;The Marx Brothers are manic in this incredible farce concerning an opera company, an ocean voyage, a love story and of course Groucho wooing, mooching etc Margaret Dumont.
238;the supporting cast does a great job and the shipboard stateroom scene is worth the price of admission.
239;To me this is the very best Marx Brother's comedy, hands down.
240;"Being an opera fan makes this movie even funnier, although you don't need to like opera to love ""A Night at the Opera""."
241;There are so many high points of this film that space would not permit.
242;A masterpiece of comedy from my favorite trio.
243;A Night At the Opera is generally considered the best or 2nd.

247;"If you have never watched ""A Night At the Opera"", you have one of the greatest comedic treats in cinema waiting for you."
248;I happened to catch this on tv the other day and I thought it was pretty good.
249;Groucho Marx is extremely funny!
250;If you love classic comedy, you'll love A NIGHT AT THE OPERA!!!
251;Finally WB has released it as a special edition.
252;A Night At the Opera is (for me) a total pleasure from start to finish.
253;The songs are easily forgetable, but they are pleasant.
254;what makes this film shine is that the Marx's are in very fine form from start to finish.
255;There are tons of classic scenes and the film holds up surprisingly well today.

265;Chico's goofiness shines in the contract routine and his bizarre piano antics, and Harpo wows with his insanely chaotic breakfast business and his stunningly funny schtick during the opera and its overture.

270;The statesroom scene is worth the price of admissionDefinitely one of the five funniest films ever made!
271;The stateroom scene is worth the price of admission
272;The zany brothers create havoc in fashionable opera circles.

274;"sharp digs at American ""moeurs""."
275;Their cheekiness, their desire (and ability) to stultify bourgeois decorum, and the unparalleled combination of Groucho and Chico's linguistic wit with Harpo's almost demonic miming, ensure another victory for the Brothers Marx.
276;A Night at the Opera (1935) remains one of the Marx Brothers' finest efforts and a comic masterpiece.
277;"However, the seeds of the Marxes' creative demise were planted in this particular film: the strong focus on music and romance
278;Groucho, in particular, is brilliant and razor.
279;Harpo's freewheeling spirit has been toned down, yet he has some truly inspired moments.
280;A splendid night is guaranteed for all.
281;Watch the opening sequence of A Night at the Opera and you will see Groucho Marx at the height of his powers.
282;A series of brilliant one.
283;liners, all delivered with impeccable timing.
284;Effortless comedy that was an influence on generations of comedians to come.
285;This is certainly in the same league as Duck Soup and probably better than A Day at the Races.
286;It also gave the other to brothers a chance to show off their musical skills as well.
287;But most of all it is Groucho who steals the show, and he is the main reason to watch the film, good as some of the supporting actors are.
288;this is now part of a great boxed set which is better value for money.
289;these guys are comedic geniuses.

293;The opera singing, Especailly from Ms. Carlisle, is top notch.

295;A Night at the Opera is actually a sweet love story at its core.
296;The destined pairing of Ricardo and Rosa is the one element of the story that keeps the film moving forward.
297;So engaging is the couple that you're cheering for them from the start.
298;They do their very best to steal your attention away from the young lovers and they succeed as usual.
299;Whether it is Otis crowding everyone from the bellhop to the manicurist into his stateroom or the diabolical plan of the trio to make the opening night audience despise Rodolfo, you cannot help but smile at The Marx Brothers' exploits.
300;The supporting actors are also in fine form as Dumont, King, Jones, and Carlisle maintain enough screen presence to keep from being overshadowed .
301;"Take a look at ""A Night at the Opera"" and brace yourself for the most fun you will ever have at the opera."
302;I always enjoy a good Marx Brothers flick.
303;As always, I knew all the lines.

313;In addition, the dramatic final horserace in """"Day"""" makes for a much more satisfying conclusion than the lovers' duet in """"Night""""."""
314;I'm a lifelong Marx Brothers fan and this is one of my favorites.
315;Some great gags and great clean humor (with a hint of innuendo)!
316;It showed me how funny movies could be, even 70 years ago.
317;groucho is top notch in this one.
318;chico has a great scene in this film too.
319;He tells a phoney story about flying across the Atlantic.
320;one of the best scenes is when they stow away in a boat, and end up in a very small room.
321;This movie will get you to really appreciate the genious of the Marx Brothers.
322;A Night at the Opera is generally regarded as the Marx Brother's best movie.
323;Filled with classic scenes and a very clever script, A Night at the Opera is a comedy classic that constantly improves with each viewing.
324;a very funny and clever movie.
325;This is the best of the marx's films.
326;it has so many laughs you can fill ten movies.
327;the comedy,the romance and the music.you will love every second in this classic comedy gem.
328;Certainly a top 3 with Animal Crackers and Duck Soup.
329;"the film features two of their best bits: The overcrowded stateroom, and Groucho explaining the Opera Contract to Chico and talking about the ""Sanity Clause"" prompting Chico to respond, ""Aww go on there ain't no Sanity Claus!"""
330;groucho's one liners are probably the best comic lines on film, and Harpo's silent antics are a delight, while Chico is up to his same old tricks.
331;The three work brilliantly while director Sam Wood and the writers work in some good musical acts and classic comedy bits.
332;time Marx Brothers fans, my wife and I recently showed this to our 11.
333;My daughter enjoyed the whole movie, finding the scene in the apartment particularly hilarious.
334;my wife and I laughed the entire time.
335;For the real classics in humor, show your children A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.
336;If you haven't seen it in a decade or more watch it again and appreciate just how great it is.
337;Not only are there the usual quota of laughs in this movie, but there is also some very fine singing.
338;groucho, Chico, and Harpo star in their most successful and in some minds, their best film.
339;"All three Marxes are at the top of their form with one famous scene after another, more than enough material to fill two movies for ""normal"" performers."
340;each time one of the brothers takes center stage I decide that he is really the best.
341;in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the brothers become secondary characters when romance rears its romantic head and that, more than anything, kind of bothers me.
342;But now that I have aged just a slight bit, I find it kind of pleasant and portions of it somewhat interesting.
343;"All he has done thus far is to draw a very handsome salary, which he later states, How many people are drawing a handsome salary these days 
344;that's the price she has to pay .
345;He needs a piece of the action, otherwise he will be left out cold.
346;the two begin a humorous dialogue with leads to Groucho signing the wrong tenor.
347;A Night At The Opera is a Marx Bros. treat which will have you laughing and rolling around on the floor more times than it is worth to get back in your chair.
348;It's definitely worth the price.
349;I think it's enjoyable for a large age range.
350;It's insanely funny in between musical numbers.
351;A classic movie and my favorite Marx Brothers comedy.
