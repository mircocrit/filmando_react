1;The people that came up with the idea to make this movie the way it was made are geniuses.
2;Playing with colour, shadow, etc.
3;Totally cool and brings out the awesomeness of the movie, scenes, actors, actions, etc.
4;the movie is masterfully directed by quenten tarantino.
5;star cast, a striking visual look, brilliant storytelling, a crazed and rather demented cast of characters, and well.
6;Sin City is easily one of the greatest films of all time (The Internet Movie Database also backs this up, considering it's on the top 250 list).
7;This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen.
8;boyfriend and her Old Town Girls (A homicidal gang of gorgeous prostitutes who run the Old Town section of Sin City), when the Old Town Girls accidentally kills a group undercover cops, Dwight is tasked with getting rid of the bodies to protect their reign over Old Town and not anger the police and mobsters and have them come after them.
9;mUSIC: The musical score was excellent and fit the film perfectly through every moment.
10;aCTING: The acting was really good, which is no surprise considering the all.
11;The dialogue was also good, and it did feel believable.
12;oVERALL: This is a must.
13;This film is totally brilliant and well.
14;tHE GOOD: The striking visual style, the action scenes, the acting and actors, the brilliant storytelling, and the great music.
15;This was definately not the case and what I ended up with was a very good piece of cinema and great stories.
16;The plots and characters are alive and real.
17;Its much more bearable to sit down and watch one story at a time now, I can even get my wife to watch and enjoy them now!
18;I'm excited for the sequel.
19;they got a fantastic cast that really brought Miller's world to life.
20;This movie is hands down fun!
21;Its action packed, and stunning.
22;If you like beautiful women, good dialogue, kick.
23;ass action sequences, and an insane depth of actors giving awsome performances than chances are you will like this movie.
24;For the people who identify Elijah Wood with the friendly hobbit from the Shire be prepared for a whole knew range of his acting ability.
25;His haunting performance alone is 5 stars.
26;This Movie is The Best of 2005!
27;If you don't know him, well, you suck.
28;Miller, Roderiguez and Tarantino combined their talents to create an amazing film.
29;"I clapped and said, ""Bravo"" after it was over."
30;But I sincerely thought it was that good.
31;it's a comic book vividly brought to life.
32;The special effects are outrageous and over.
33;top, just as they should be.
34;It's fun to be drawn into a fantasy world that's full of action, suspense and death.
35;the use of color was both brilliant and stunning.
36;just enough to remind you that it is a fictional world.
37;Like most films Tarantino is involved in, you'll see unexpected performances from people you probably never have imagined in that role.
38;They're given an opportunity to demonstrate their diversity and they always shine.
39;Look, I'm going to be honest here.
40;There's nothing I can tell you right now, in this review, that you haven't heard before in other reviews.
41;There's also nothing that can be put in print that will ever do justice to this movie.
42;Sin City is simply the most entertaining movie I have ever seen in theaters.
43;"Sin City, inspired by the graphic comics by Frank Miller (who shares directing credits alongside those ""troublemakers"" Robert Rodirguez and Quentin Tarantino) will likely be unlike anything you have ever seen."
44;First off, the movie is gorgeous, shot in stark black and white, with color making a few choice cameo appearances.
45;And there's chunks in that soup, people!
46;The casting choices were also very interesting.
47;Surprisingly, everyone does a convincing job in their roles, even though they are all just support to the real stars: the sex and the violence.
48;Sin City is really the ultimate movie.
49;It leaves a lasting impression, and is destined for mega.
50;Truly a film you'll need to see over and over again to absorb everything.
51;Believe the hype, this is an incredible film.
52;A friend of mine collected the comic books and I never checked them out.
53;The movie is totally awesome with the affects and the big name actors in it.
54;Sorry, but right now, all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
55;At points it reminds of Casablanca while meeting a massive bloodbath.
56;There are also amazing comic style angles brought to life in the cinematography.
57;A brilliant peice of film that will hopefully be rememebered for it's trail blazed in black, white, blood, booms, badabooms and bullets for decades to come.
58;So yeah, I loved it.
59;This is the coolest looking movie I have ever seen.
60;Rodriguez did an amazing job directing this masterpiece of a movie.
61;This movie looks so amazing, I could watch it with the sound muted and still enjoy it.
62;It is so appealing to the eye to see nothing but blacks, whites, and greys.
63;To see nothing but black and white and all of a sudden see green eyes or red lips is a pleasing surprise.
64;If you move past the visuals, you get the fantasic acting by a great ensemble cast.
65;The other thing that is awesome is the interweaving of three seperate stories into one seamless movie.
66;All in all, I loved everything about this movie.
67;Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future.
68;"Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City""."
69;This movie will be as influential on future movie.
70;"making as the original ""Star Wars"" was in its day."
71;This is a great movie.
72;The style that the movie was shot in was also quite entertaining.
73;"Even Bruce Willis, a favorite of mine, disappointed (For a good new Bruce flick, catch ""Hostage"")."
74;but, you could still go for a good laugh, I guess.
75;it touched the primal parts of my humanity.
76;strong, honorable, wise, and lustful.
77;It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.
78;A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.
79;Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.
80;It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it.
81;All packaging and contents were in tact, and the cardstock wrap art was still present!
82;I give this four stars.
83;But I can over look that and see the film for what it was a Great film.
84;The story telling and the style was great.
85;If you loved this movie and didn't download it get it other wise wait until the great 3/4 disk set comes out.
86;it's a SOLID performance from Mirimax/Dimension.
87;Subtitles are large, displayed in yellow, and easily readable against the image.
88;video: 5/5Audio:The sound on this baby packs quite a punch, and right from the word go you'll be pleasantly surprised.
89;Make sure you crank this up to full volume, as it deserves this experience to be fully appreciated.
90;Overall, a nice job boys.
91;"scenes"" featurette, giving you a teaser of what we'll expect on the future Director's edition coming out."
92;Fantastic Visuals, Excellent Audio, and great extras, this is the benchmark for future UMD releases.
93;I have read the graphic novels ''Hard goodbyes'',''A dame to kill for'',and ''The big fat kill'',and sure,the last one was the best comic I have ever read(and I'm a comic collector,so imagine),but I never expected this.
94;robert's genuine raises this film into the highest level it could go.
95;dwight is also a good guy,trying to protect the girls of Sin City.
96;hartigan is the most innocent of all the men in the film,a man with honour and umbelievable self.
97;nancy is the most innocent girl in the film,a person that sees Hartigan as a father and a lover figure at the same time.
98;all those characters make the best film that I have ever seen 'till now.
99;because,as Marv greatly puts it:''Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything''.
100;One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.
101;Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.
102;This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.
103;Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super.
104;The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.
105;I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.
106;Of course when I think of noir it is 1940s.50s noir, black and white in film and in the good guys.
107;top action of this three vignettes series on modern day good guys versus bad guys.
108;date use of cinematography to give a gritty black and white feel to the adventures.
109;but here is the funny thing, funny for an old.
110;time crime noir aficionado, I really liked this film.
111;Good guys (and then it was mostly guys.
112;"They got mussed, up, trussed up, busted up in the cause of some individual justice drive that drove the ""better angels of their natures."""
113;"When the tv show Miami Vice first became popular, a colleague described it to me as the ""triumph of style over substance."""
114;clothes, cars, music, setting .
115;In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.
116;dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one.
117;dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two.
118;The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made.
119;up actors, digital backgrounds, and high.
120;It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.
121;year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.
122;Movie is perfectly acted, violent, and graphically beautiful.
123;"Spend the extra US$5 and get the ""Uncut, super."
124;this is a pretty good movie the only thing i would say is very violent and gory.
125;Love the movie and the dark sort of animation of it.
126;If you haven't seen it and are into the gritty super action flix's the you gotta give it a shot one of my fav movies.
127;Visually stunning, and super cool throughout.
128;Alba, gorgeous as always, but overall the movie never really delivers what it could.
129;And Rodriguez' commentaries and extras are always incredibly interesting.
130;"I also liked Devon Aoki as ""Miho"" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88."
131;The black and white film with the splashes of color mixed in was fantastic.
132;"There are also scenes that will definitely bring to mind ""Kill Bill""."
133;time favorite movies, destined, I'm sure, to become a cult classic.
134;watched this in anticipation of A Dame to Die For release somewhat soon and it was just as unique and outstanding as when I saw it in theaters years back.
135;Robert Rodriguez, the one man film crew, knows how to give the audience a good time and this film is no exception, this movie rocks!
136;Sin City is a guilty pleasure, plain and simple.
137;That being said, it features an art style that is absolutely gorgeous and storylines that are engrossing.
138;Sin City is filmed to look like a comic book come to life, and in that goal, it succeeds.
139;The black and white mixed with limited and strategic coloring is beautiful on screen and is visually one of the most unique movies ever made.
140;I actually prefer and recommend the original, theatrical version over the separated extended cut.
141;even though there is some questionable acting at times, Sin City is a one of a kind experience featuring a strong narrative, brutal violence, and some unforgettable characters.
142;Gritty, sometimes funny, gory thriller with an all.
143;I absolutely love this movie!
144;I love the storyline and it came right on time for christmas.
145;I bought this for my niece as a gift.
146;Sin City is one of my favorite movies of the 2000's.
147;The clarity is much better, colors pop, and you couldn't ask for a better audio track.
148;If you love this movie and are still not sold on upgrading to Blu.
149;ray: This disc will change your mind.
150;No matter how many times I have viewed this movie I still look forward to seeing it again.
151;i will say that I really liked the cinematography.
152;The look of the movie was great, and that was the part (going into it) that I thought I'd like the least, but it ended up working very well.
153;Sin City is the best film of 2005 (with the exception maybe of 'Star Wars Episode III').
154;Rodriguez, Miller, and Tarantino do a fantastic job of bringing a visual masterpiece to film.
155;Mickey Rourke does the best job in the film as the vicious animal Marv, who is out to avenge the death of a hooker he barely knows.
156;This one is the third best story.
157;The Marv story is the best, then Hartigan's then Dwight's, then the Man's story (which is the shortest).
158;They pretty much all interact with each other as well, even though they are each stand alone stories.
159;At which point the movie will reach five stars.
160;A great delux set of the soon to be classic film series.
161;The bonus' are a ton of fun.
162;A must for a fan of the novels or of the film!
163;Sin City is a comic book on a big screen.
164;Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.
165;Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.
166;Sin City has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.
167;Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.
168;"On this scale, ""Sin City"" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer."
169;There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time.
170;There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.
171;The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.
172;It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.
173;"It's dark, gritty and aggressive
174;`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.
175;the acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.
176;I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.
177;Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.
178;The acting thus corresponds with this vision.
179;It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.
180;bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.
181;Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.
182;As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.
183;I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.
184;If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.
185;So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.
186;This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone.
187;wARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!Robert Rodriguez co. directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a """"Special Guest Director"""") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever."""
188;star cast would be an understatement.
189;Up next, is the set.
190;"(SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is ""The Big Fat Kill""."
191;as I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.
192;Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.
193;with all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2.
194;I watched it and I actually enjoyed it for the most part, and I'm a girl.
195;It was really fun to just watch (even if there was no audio)the black and white with certain things colored really worked and looked awesome on the big screen.
196;I really enjoyed Marv's(Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan's(Bruce Willis) stories.
197;They were the most interesting and fun to watch.
198;"But if I just ignore that part and focus on the rest of the movie I really really liked it even if it was violent and a ""guy flick""(naked girls)."
199;I recommend this movie to adults only and those who don't care about violence, nudity, and swearing.
200;"And it does deserve it's ""R"" rating and 18 years and up warning!"
201;I love this movie despite some of the kind of questionable acting at parts.
202;I reccomend everyone see it at least once if only for the cinematography
203;Sin City is such a unique movie.
204;It is luxurious and terrifying, absurd and brilliant, deep and visceral.
205;"Sin City is, in more ways than one, like ""Pulp Fiction""."
206;Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him.
207;This was done naturally to frame Marv.
208;He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter.
209;This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.
210;the fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter.
211;Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over.
212;He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her.
213;This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.
214;"to put in simple terms, ""Sin City"" is an excellent movie."
215;It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well.
216;And the nudity isn't even satisfying.
217;This movie is beautiful, ugly, touching and shocking all at once.
218;It is unlike anything seen before.
219;And it's tone is very dark.
220;But it's passion draws you in.
221;And the physical world that Frank Miller created has been faithfully reproduced by Robert Rodriguez and his team.
222;This is a landmark movie.
223;And the performance by Mickey Rourke as Marv is Oscar.
224;He has vindicated those of us who have always believed he was a great actor in the tradition of Brando and DeNiro.
225;So, I settled on a solid four.
226;firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent.
227;It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike.
228;The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick.
229;It's filled to the brim with Arnold.
230;Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans.
231;Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people.
232;All this comes together to make Sin City the all.
233;It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book.
234;It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.
235;It is still a superior version, only not by much.
236;In a short time the 2 disk S. e. will be here with more extras than you will know what to do with!
237;The trailer song was hot, and the actual visuals on the trailer were good as well.
238;At first when I walked out of the theatre I didn't know what to think, but I realized I really liked the movie.
239;The picture and visuals worked really well.
240;It was really much like a comic book made to life.
241;I thought the acting was really well done and I happened to like most of the characters.
242;Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke also contribute some good acting.
243;A highly attractive cast in this movie which also adds to the glamorous visuals.
244;Most likely you will end up having a favorite character.
245;I'd certainly recommend seeing the film.
246;I highly recommend this to anyone, especially those with an interest in comic books.
247;Yes, the violence is completely over the top and sensational.
248;What makes this movie one of the best I have seen in years lies in three areas:The first is believability of character.
249;I never onced doubted the truth of these characters, definitely a testament to the skill of the actors involved.
250;the second is a distinct and totally immersive style.
251;The colors the lighting all serve to bring you completely into Sin City.
252;the third, and most important to me, is the completely real morality of this movie.
253;This departure from your standard hollywood trash really puts this one over into 5star category.
254;in summary this film has incredible style, raw emotion and a refreshing realistic morality.
255;All of which serves to make this one of the best films to come out in any category in the past several years.5 out of 5!
256;Sin City is a visually striking film.
257;It fully succeeds in capturing the feel of the graphic novel it is based on and of Film Noir in general.
258;The acting is also good, within the limitations of the comic book.
259;The interlinked stories are well told.
260;For example, in a film which is filled with eye.
261;"One aspect of American Culture I have always found puzzling is the propensity to view the most ghastly and sadistic forms of violence as ""good wholesome entertainment"" while a glimpse of an exposed nipple on television sends the whole nation into hysterics."
262;Most of these women are portrayed as intelligent, strong, and perfectly capable of defending themselves.
263;"I loved every minute
264;I read the comics and Mickey Rourke did an excellent job as Marv.
265;Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did an excellent job I have never seen anything truer to a book before.
266;The way the movie was filmed was very unique and the acting was top notch as well.
267;I am so proud of Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarnitino for making sure their movies get widescreen only releases.
268;Other than that, this movie is fantastic and everything a comic book movie should be.
269;It is rated R for a reason and if you were to read the comics, they are exactly the same way.
270;Frank Miller's graphic novel is truly graphic in every sense of the word.
271;I can't even begin to describe how amazing and revolutionary this film is.
272;An instant classic, like Pulp Fiction on mescaline but at the same time standing by itself as possibly the best comic book adaptation.
273;I have all the confidence in the world saying that because watching this film is like watching the graphic novel come to life.
274;The cinematography is as brilliant as it is beautiful.
275;quite simply, a movie miracle, 'nuff said.
276;Good things come to those who wait.
277;rare artist who'd rather see the integrity of the work be upheld than make a quick buck.
278;minute film complete with full special effects and a name actor in Josh Hartnett.
279;time director can do with passion, dedication, and most importantly, a love of the source material.
280;Peter Jackson did it, and Sam Raimi is re.
281;In it's accuracy, Rodriguez's dedication to the material is clear.
282;But that's a good thing for those of us who don't want to see our films made metro.
283;so is it worth seeing?
284;I thought the acting was awesome, the effects were brilliant, and the story line was great.
285;As for people like me who love gore, violence, and a great creative story line, this is right up your alley.
286;Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development.
287;robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers.
288;the only fault in """"Sin City"""" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters."""
289;star cast in one of the best films ever made.
290;Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth.
291;Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool.
292;First, let me say that Sin City is the type of movie I normally love to watch.
293;I think most of the actors are great, I like just about everything Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino have ever done, and I admire Frank Miller's writing.
294;"the main draw of the film is that it's made to look like a comic book come to life, and in that sense it's a success
295;My advice to everyone else is to watch it once, admire the movie's innovative style, overlook all of its flaws, then forget about it.
296;I enjoyed Sin City in the movie theater.
297;It has excellent performances by a multitude of stars and accurately captures the style and substance of Frank Miller's """"graphic novels."""
298;a larger than life cartoon portrayal .
299;I think you will enjoy it.
300;Perhaps most impressive is the presentation of the separate tales in separate segments as they were told in the original Miller works.
301;This allows each to stand on its own and the addition of more and clarifying footage.
302;the commentary by directors Rodriguez and Miller is excellent are all the other special features.
303;I come to the movies to be entertained not to watch boring talk with no color.
304;Go see The Pacifier with Vin Diesel instead.
305;He's a much better actor than anyone in this movie.
306;put the kids to bed and enjoy.
307;This was without a doubt, the best movie I have seen in the last few years.
308;I was 100% riveted, 100% of the time.
309;This movie is a must see.
310;The visuals are genius, and even the cheesy film noir dialog is perfection.
311;the director has already stated there is a expanded 'special edition' coming out in the future.
312;As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City.
313;this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.
314;still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard.
315;Who cares if the visuals are stunning.
316;it's beautiful to look at and has way more charm.
317;Love the books own the books, the movie is wonderful, beautiful and breathtaking, not leaving any thing out.
318;I really liked and loved this movie.
319;Disc 1 contains the extended theatrical release plus extras which focus on some of the film's special features, such as the cars, costumes, props, and make.
320;The car segment was particularly interesting, as it shows how various classic cars were sought out to help give the Sin City its film noir feel.
321;"Disc 2 includes some more unique extras, including a fascinating ""green."
322;while not exactly my cup of tea, this movie was undeniably entertaining, with the included extras definitely making the deluxe edition worthwhile.
323;From what I could tell, the film stayed very true to Frank Miller's original graphic novels (almost TOO true, as the dialogue had moments that were undeniably comical, but not in the good way), and so I'm sure Miller's fans will be thrilled with this big.
324;If you like comic books this movie is the best adaption of a comic I have ever seen.
325;Robert Rodriquez is truly a genius!!
326;First off, I am a huge Frank Miller fan!
327;Jessica Alba, great body, no acting skills .
328;see Fantastic Four, or entire career.
329;Roy Batty (I mean Rutger Hauer) actually works as a Cardinal.
330;Rosario Dawson, perfect look for Gail.
331;the LookThe film is both faithful to the source material and beautiful, environments, clothing, rain all bathed in a world of impenetrable shadow and glowing light, work as they did on the comic book page.
332;But the actors faces are lit with more definition, mid.
333;When actors are not the primary focus on screen, the look is incredible.
334;most comic book movies are hurt by odd changes to the source material.
335;if you want to see a movie with the look of Sin City where the actors and environments mesh perfectly, check out Renaissance!
336;The Sin City story is better, but visually, Renaissance works much better.
337;SIN CITY is one of those miraculous movies that seems to come along every once in a while.
338;Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller have fashioned the perfect comic book on film.
339;The overblown characters and impossible action take place in the netherworld of their combined imaginations, leaving us w/ a masterwork of incredible, explosive entertainment.
340;Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future.
341;"Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City""."
342;This movie will be as influential on future movie.
343;"making as the original ""Star Wars"" was in its day."
344;visually, cinematographically, the movie is genius.
345;"If you've seen the trailers, you knew that something new and excitingly ""awe."
346;In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream.
347;He is over the top.
348;But he carries us over the top with him, like King Kong with Faye Wray.
349;kneed way to describe the spectacularly and terrifyingly gender.
350;driven bloodlust that fuels the film.
351;someday, I dream, Tarantino and Rodriguez will put their genius at film as medium in the service of a philosophical idea that they recognize as bigger than themselves.
352;"They have perfected stylistized violence
353;I cannot even imagine how wonderful, how superb, how phenomenal that film might be, if they were to grow up, explore the universe a little bit more, and take us with them.
354;It strikes me as funny that the """"star"""" that this edition of the movie that Amazon."""
355;What you'll find if you're not a comic/graphic novel geek is a compelling visual experience.
356;What Rodriguez/Miller do with color and movement in the movie is really interesting.
357;"do the benefits of the ""Special Edition"" really add up to the cost?"
358;Here's the order in which I experianced the world of Sin City:First I saw the trailer, I knew what actors were in this movie, I got a glimps of what the atmosphere was like, and I had no idea what was CG and what wasn't.
359;Next I got excited about the whole thing and bought all the graphic novels that the movie was based on.
360;"So when I came time to see the actual movie, I not only understood what some of the visual ""oddities"" where (e. i. Marv's bandages on his face, Contrasting bricks in shadows), but I was actually greatly amused that those details were included in the film."
361;It's much more amusing when you're watching the movie and are consistantly reminded of how f***ing accurate it is to the graphic novel.
362;It transcends beyond all conventional film.
363;a troubled actor but onscreen, he is at his best.
364;last Thought I: visually stunning, fast.
365;paced adventure yet with thought.
366;It is definately the way to go because it makes a truly amazing movie even better!
367;ray is also stunning on my tv.
368;I thought it would be just like the movie version but with the extended scenes added to it.
369;A must have for Robert Rodriguez directed films fans!
370;an excellent character study as well as restraint on profanity and racist slurs which made this film much more entertaining.
371;Sin City stays true to and respects the pages of Frank Miller's Sin City.
372;I just knew a comic book version existed.
373;Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant director and partnered with Frank Miller himself, and Quentin Tarantino.
374;Sin City is a great movie for all, fans of the books or not.
375;It's a dark, twisted, screwed up city that can and will eat you alive if you let it.
376;`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown.
377;Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise.
378;Very confusing!Another triumph was from the casting director.
379;The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type.
380;I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.
381;the bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.
382;Okay all of you comic book lovers out there, let's look at this film for a minute.
383;i love to watch action in films as much as the next gruesome guy.
384;I enjoyed the new release of SERENITY in theaters.
385;i will say that it was engaging to watch the black and white sceenshots mix with bright colors, but that's just visuals.
386;There HAS to be more.
387;It has sex, violence during sex, disembowling procedures, disembowling during sexy scenes, and .
388;The directors choices, over and over again, are amazing.
389;Being in the industry, I look at films in terms of editing, score, directing, etc.
390;Still and all, a great piece.
391;This movie was really good.
392;I am not familiar with the comic book this is based on, but I will need to acquiant myself with it, due to this movie.
393;sin City had a really good, original and exciting storyline, the direction was good, the acting was fine, and the casting was really good.
394;so, to close you have a good,exciting, original styled dark.
395;"themed movie
396;I would strongly recommend this movie!
397;Some movies are so deep, so subtle, you can watch them over and over, and pick up something new every time.
398;Flash Gordon was my former number one guilty pleasure.
399;When I watched it, and now, when I watch Sin City, the fun comes from seeing the same things each time: when I hear Marv tell a guy """"That's a nice coat you're wearing,"""" I know the guy's in big trouble."""
400;"Although it never happens, I half expect to hear Marv tell Cardinal Roark, ""That's a nice robe you're wearing."
401;Usually, good drama comes from good villains.
402;"As Marv puts it ""I love hit men."
403;Right in the opening scene, the rain makes an appearance that sets a tone and tells a story.
404;the graphics pull us into Sin City's unreal world that has very real people in it.
405;In other words, it's the Republican vision of the future.
406;1, The Patriot and Saving Private Ryan, and your citizenship grades in school are consistently perfect, then PROBABLY, you should be able to see this film.
407;This film is my personal new favorite film.
408;Some seens are so Robert Rodriguez, and by that I mean fantastical gunplay that brings a smile to your face.
409;Its comic book dialogue makes it ring true to the storyline.
410;recommendations: Once upon a Time in Mexico, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, Spiderman 2, and Batman Begins.
411;all in all, I found Sin City to be a brilliant and well.
412;I watched it the other day and enjoyed every frieken minute of it.
413;stylish, action packed, visually stunning, and loaded with a tremendous cast.
414;"this movie delivers the goods in every scene and is the only movie based on a comic that actually comes across as a ""live."
415;this is a fantastic film.
416;wonderful eye candy with awesome direction and cameos throughout!This is the most original movie I have seen all summer!!
417;It is definitely a masterpiece of direction and photography!!
418;This is a Great movie I loved it can't wait for the second one to hit the theaters soon !!!!
419;The acting is so hammy and heavy.
420;Great stuff, if you think like Lynndie England.
421;Sin city may have to be the best movie I have seen this year.
422;Mikey Rouke steals the show as Marv, the hulkish thug whose main purpose is to find the killers of the love of his life, and give them some street justice.
423;His story is compelling and very, very, violent.
424;This is a pretty cool flick.
425;Lots of action and a grizzled Bruce Willis to boot.
426;If you like action and/or noir, you'll enjoy this one.
427;Like modern day shakespere but with guns.
428;I enjoyed it, although this is not my favorite type of movie genre.
429;There's a fairly good cast and the story held my interest well (with the exception of one small part) Overall, I would say it is worth a watch.
430;"robert rodriguez, veteran of the ""el mariachi"" series, and guest director tarantino do a fine job of directing an excellent cast."
431;rourke, willis, wood, dawson, and alba all turn in brilliant performances.
432;and the look of the film is truly breath.
433;despite the fact that all the scenery is pretty obviously cgi generated, it's still spot on, corresponding almost exactly to miller's unique illustration style.
434;the city is dirty, gritty, sexy, dangerous.
435;despite the fact that the film features strong, independent female characters, like gail, the gun.
436;that women are strong, but men will always be stronger.
437;so definitely watch this film.
438;it's visually stunning, violent, exciting, and perverse.
439;Sin City is a good movie.
440;it's one comic flick that sticks to it's original orgin.
441;there's no Batmans or Supermans , but you have comicbook characters that have their special powers mostly strength.
442;conceptions for a movie of this hype long before they even give it a chance.
443;Drop your expectations and you'd be surprised how much you can enjoy ANY movie.
444;I've done quite a few theatre shows, and as a mandatory skill, you have to overact.
445;I truly believe the acting was exceedingly excellent and not as easy or crappy as so many of you haters think.
446;you friggin do it and hope you do it well.
447;Good deeds are never rewarded.
448;This is the underbelly of what our planet is slowly building towards and that makes you mad that we can enjoy it as entertainment.
449;It is true to the comic and is an amazing genre.
450;Had to watch this film for class.
451;The books were visually smart.
452;The movie takes it up a notch on how to take a very distinct look and makes it ( gasp) better.
453;"i've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen."
454;"I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day."
455;The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.
456;There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office.
457;Sin City is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen.year.
458;old in all of us, and what fun it is.
459;I have 5 stars here for the movie, which I enjoyed greatly.
460;But it does look very cool.
461;I had a great time watching the movie.
462;But, for adults, it is a very good movie.
463;Sin City really did turn out to be a great comic book movie.
464;The cinematography was great, the acting good and the storyline flowed, albeit in disjointed scenes, leaving you with the feeling that you got a complete picture.
465;through the adventures of a few misfits battling the ruling Roark family (the Senator and his son, as well as the Cardinal) we get a tale that is moving and fun.
466;The use of colors to accentuate characters and scenes is amazing, adding much to the storyline.
467;at times it can be looked at as unrealistic but, lets face it, it is a comic book movie, so suspend reality for 2 hours and let yourself be taken for a ride, that is if you don't mind watching a little violence.
468;I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
469;Much like a moving comic book presentation.
470;"But it is the use of black&white
471;Even if you don't like the film it is worth watching for that.
472;Also I felt the story line was good.
473;But if you don't even like it after you watch it, you'll have to admit the visuals are stunning.
474;The movie itself is amazing.
475;Frank Miller's comics are riveting and with his guiding hand, Robert Rodriguez could not have translated his masterpiece to the screen any better.
476;in sum, the movie, the acting, the style, everything about the film itself is amazing, ingenious, the description can go on.
477;I'll be honest with you.
478;it's action packed, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's clever.
479;run will be it's playback value.
480;This is a great movie.
481;I really can't praise it enough, wonderful story and great acting and special effects.
482;Plus it looks gorgeous on blu ray.
483;This is a movie where you have to really watch the whole thing to truly appreciate it.
484;This really hampered the enjoyment of the movie for me at first.
485;once it was over though and I set back and digested what I had just watched, I found that I really liked it.
486;It is completely original and engaging.
487;disc sets and extras, then go right ahead.
488;Things move in this movie.
489;They really make a comic book alife.
490;they have a wonderful casts.
491;The reason for me to go see this movie is Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis.
492;Jessica Alba really can dance and she is very sexy in the movie.
493;but that is what Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's work are famous for and the reason (some) people love it.
494;The PQ is great, the way the monochrome contrasts the purposely expressed colours of reds and yellows and blue is just truly dazzling and eye popping!
495;highly recommended for those that wants to treat their eyes!
496;I know mine enjoyed it!!!
497;the graphics in this movie (just like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, both of which being completely filmed against blue screens) make this movie quite fun to watch, and the black and white effect takes you deep into the gritty world of Basin City.
498;Also, I must mention the absolutely brilliant narration.
499;It introduces the characters and their situation very well, and served as a raw opener for each character.
500;Miller has proved his worth writing the original comics, and does so yet again directing this movie.
501;Rodriguez does another fine film, and receives (quite frankly, deserves) respect for sticking to the comics so well.
502;Taratino again proves his curious love for blood in movies.
503;He's got to keep her safe"
504;This movie is dark and surreal, the way I like it.
505;Best movie I've seen in a long time.
506;Like the movie I loved the original theatre release version.
507;It's amazing and exciting to see so many of the comic book hereos of the past come back to life!!
508;It arrived in a timely manner and if asked I would do business with this person again.
509;Started to watch this movie with a great expectations and so did my dear wife.
510;That Hollywood is more than goofy, everybody knows that, esp.
511;"us, ""old timers"" who saw in their younger years good old King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur and James Steward in any of his movies."
512;"If I were an actor of Bruce Willis's type, I would get together w/other top caliber actors and create a ""new Hollywood"" company without those 4 letter words and sexual perversity."
513;nice looking characters and not monstreous and ugly looking faces of kids and people.
514;This movie is off the wall good.
515;All the characters are close to perfectly castes.
516;But `Sin City' is not a good comic book, it's the best there is.
517;Frank Miller directs an amazing adaptation of his stories that is sure to please fans of the comic book, and normal people too.
518;why it works: The key reason why `Sin City' works is that it is amazingly faithful to the comic, almost word.
519;I still remember those classic lines 13 years later.
520;well cast: The trailers boast an all.
521;"While normally I sense dread with an ""all star cast"" as a sign of making up for a lack of good characters, here they were very well cast."
522;eye Candy: Just like the comic the film is non stop orgy of visually stunning eye candy.
523;"Making you say, ""Wow look at that!"
524;it's good to see this film generating interest in the under valued medium of comic books.
525;So in conclusion, whether you own every Frank Miller comic ever written or think `Sin City' is a computer video game, you will love this film for its great characters, intense plots, and dazzling eye candy.
526;Sin City's visual flair is what sets it apart from other action films.
527;It is dark and gritty, and it should be, definitely because it based on the graphic novel of the same name.
528;Sin City also boasts a superb cast, and with Frank Miller at the helm, this new film should be the epitome of excitement!
529;well, really the only greatly anticipated movie of a rather dull spring movie season.
530;It was, in short, utterly fantastic.
531;As a avid fan of Film Noir these were all very, very good signs for me.
532;Frankly, it was the best comic book I ever read.
533;The combination of gritty, noir.
534;max storytelling, and stark back and white art was simply mind.
535;Sin City was now one of my most anticipated films of 2005, if not the most anticipated.
536;I loved the opening short.
537;story, which I had already seen thanks to the 2004 preview, as well as the first story of Marv, and The Hard Goodbye.
538;This knowledge, and experience, of the source, is quite key I believe to fully.
539;Having now read both of the other books, and seen Sin City the film again, I can confirmed that is true.
540;I am now able to enjoy Sin City to its fullest.
541;And it's hammered at you fast and often.
542;"This pacing also allows for excellent ""rewatchability"" factor."
543;top Michael Madsen (which I won't go into), nearly all of the performances in Sin City are first rate.
544;Some even bordering on the spectacular.
545;In his writings creator Frank Miller injected Marv with a large amount of solemn dignity and empathy, and Rourk brings this to life beautifully.
546;But a bad guy with good intentions, and a good heart.
547;star cast all give noticeable strong performances.
548;Even Elijah Wood's silent role as the mute cannibal Kevin is excellent in an eery and villainous tone.
549;the score of the film is impressive as well.
550;Written by Rodriguez himself, it's an excellent collection of classic bass lines, and horn pieces adding to the cult tone of the film.
551;The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen.
552;From it's comic book originated shot selection and angles, to its stark black, white and silver palate, Sin City is truly art brought to life, and its truly a pleasure to view and watch.
553;But the best feature of the CGI would have to be its overall ambiguity.
554;But for fans of the genre, like myself, Sin City is just about as perfect as any film could hope to be.
555;Genre: Action, Drama, Dark ComedyGenre Grade: AFinal Grade: AThis was a spectacular movie with great achievements on all levels.
556;a strong one that molds together to fit into a story that comes together in the end without ever confusing the audience as to what is going on and who is who.
557;The dialogue seemed like it had been written by Tarantino himself, sticking to the classic, bold lines that make you grin and really root for the characters.
558;Even Jessica Alba did a great job in her acting!
559;Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, and Mickey Rourke all did a great job with their characters as well.
560;great movie, but definitely one to keep kids away from.
561;Think Silence of the Lambs meets Se7en meets classic crime drama, and you got Sin City.
562;Oh, and I found out which part of the film Tarantino directed.
563;"The most striking ""moving pictures"" in some time."
564;Could be watched with no sound and still be riveting.
565;This was visually one of the best films I've seen in years.
566;This special disk takes the stories and sets them apart which makes it easier to follow.
567;It wasn't the best story wise, but it's great visually.
568;I give the movie 2 1/2 stars, and the special edition disk four stars.
569;Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino produced another masterpiece.
570;Black and white scenes and absurd colors make this movie very unique.
571;Players (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen) performance are great.
572;There are three stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) in the movie, each is very interesting.
573;this is another digital masterpiece and very creative story.
574;It is possible to see Tarantino effect on it.
575;This is a nice package for a film such as this.
576;My only wish, is that it would contain more interviews with Frank Miller and how he brought Sin City to life as a comic book.
577;But other than that, there's a nice selection of interesting features on how they made this fantastic film.
578;Frank Miller's blood sweat and tears have paid off greatly with the release of this wonderful film.
579;I love it when films become instant cult classics purely based upon the originality of the media .
580;"To see his world transferred to a feature film was quote ""A dream come true"" It seems that a wide range of viewers actually dislike the films dialogue and plot transfer."
581;At times it can read rather dull, but if you have seen any of the Sin City graphic novels, you can quickly understand that it is all part of a stylish flow which can be easily accepted once understood.
582;Luckily with full control over the production (a rarity in this industry) both were able to sculpt the feature into a beautiful mold of dark comedy, ultra violence, sex, and all that good stuff.
583;So the original literature comes to life.
584;That is a fantastic graphic novel and I highly recommend it.
585;But the fact is, this film (based on Frank Miller's graphic comics) and its directors (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller himself) should be commended.
586;making and what we will see on the big.
587;"Simply stated, this movie is an unapologetic feast for the eyes
588;But because of the recent split within Miramax the """"Special Edition"""" version of Sin City won't be out until next year some time, but if you're a fan or could care less about the extra features (for now), then jump right on in, the water is fine."""
589;Sin City's landscape and cinematic appearance is well done.
590;It's kind of a cross between a black and white comic book and real actors.
591;What really makes this movie great are the emotions and personalities of the characters.
592;I hope they make another one.
593;I saw this movie on a website titled 50 best nerd movies so I decided for $10 to watch it.
594;Turned out to be a good choice.
595;flick as you can get!
596;With the unusual coloring and camera angles it is almost as if the comic book itself started moving and telling its story.
597;My friend said he thought it was pretty good.
598;I had to digest the movie for a while before I came to the conclusion that this is a darn good movie and is a guilty pleasure to watch.
599;It was a very interesting show.
600;shipping is easy and the trip to the mail box is without a car, so gas is also a hugh savings.
601;Sin City has all of it: a good story, excellent cast (a cast of who's who) and the best part is the cinematography.
602;Not since Dick Tracy 15 years ago has a comic book looked so good on the big screen.
603;The colors of the comics comes alive in Rodrigues's movie.
604;I think Miller likes to take things to the next levels and be extreme.
605;In an interview I read he liked the works of Ayn Rand, and her novel the Fountainhead.
606;In a world where film noir is taken to the next level, Politics and Religious figures take advantage of their power and commit sexual acts without remorse.
607;Where everyone is pretty much the antihero and where men become caricatures of a film noir hero, our heroes have become bad and the antiheroes have to run wild exacting proper justice.
608;Miller is showing us the evolution of the film noir and that means, taken to the extreme, being a man means to be brutish lug who slap around helpless females.
609;But the white light is love in this ying yang relationship in film noir, that is worth fighting for.
610;An instant classic since the night I watched it.
611;thanks again for the Collectible set!
612;the movie is visually beautiful.
613;this point has also been made before but it's worth saying again: The movie is NOT meant to be realistic.
614;realist forms of art, the deliberate break from naturalistic images allows us to see past the images to the ideas and feelings beneath them, and that's what a lot of people seem to have missed.
615;on the subject of the acting, yes Mickey Rourke and Benicio did great jobs, but they also had the best lines.
616;"lastly, one of the defining themes in Miller's writing career from ""Batman: the Dark Knight Returns"", through ""Ronin"" and ""Daredevil"" to Sin City, is his profound contempt for the hypocrisy and self."
617;In fact, the only male figure who survives is (interestingly) Dwight, the only guy who allies himself with powerful female characters (Rosario Dawson's Gail and Devon Aoki's Miho).
618;world sex trade, of course) and their independance is what they were fighting to protect.
619;I think this is a far more complex movie than a lot of people want to think it is.
620;"The delighted vengefulness which imbues this movie comes from nothing so much as our own outrage when the suits and their toadying minions stomp down on the rest of us: ""Kill him for me Marv."
621;I new who Frank Miller was but had never really seen any of his work.
622;There is a great story that unfolds through out the entire movie.
623;"As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's ""Graphic"" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie."
624;The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.
625;However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good.
626;This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.
627;The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.
628;"With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his ""angel"" for a showdown."
629;Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.
630;all of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.
631;Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.
632;As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.
633;The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.
634;The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.
635;It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.
636;So hungry I am for originality.
637;So hungry I am for filmmakers with a unique vision and the know.
638;how to give us something new and MEMORABLE!!!!!
639;Thank you, thank you, thank you Frank Miller, Robert Rodriquez, Quentin Tarantino and everyone else who had anything to do with this BEAUTIFUL film.
640;But, beautifully shot and designed.
641;You took us and our imaginations to a new place.
642;You told us stories that pulled no punches and kept us on our toes.
643;With its 60s style and Humphrey Bogartish delivery, it packed a tremendous punch of creativity, design, grit and grime.
644;with it's beautiful black and white colors and the occasional splash of red, it moves like a painting.
645;I want to see more, and I want to read Frank Miller's books now.
646;He has to!This movie is great.
647;If anything, even if you don't like violence, hitting the play button, YOU WILL see something new, original and CREATIVE.
648;Surely, the special edition will be coming soon!
649;Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and QT (his 2 cents worth) have made a stunningly singular film that makes for a quite a memorable moviegoing experience.
650;Jamie King is drop dead gorgeous, as is Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy.
651;benecio Del Toro proves to be the best among the male cast as the mercurial Jackie Boy, although Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis (and surprisingly Elijah Wood) more than hold their own as well.

655;The last tale is an odd love story between old washed.
656;the cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances.
657;It is darkly beautiful to look at, even through all the blood.
658;The task, or the responsibility, of a director to take on a project involving the adaptation of a comic book is crucial.
659;It is crucial in respects of getting the job done.
660;It is critical for the director to capture the spirit of the story, characters and setting.
661;this is the best comic book or graphic novel film ever made.
662;Frank Miller's Sin City is a creation beyond the imaginative nightmare.
663;It has style with fashion, affection and hate.
664;"Robert Rodriguez has ingeniously redefined ""reproduction"" in a new postmodern experience."
665;The replica on the screen is incredibly audacious and it achieves itself as a visual masterpiece, exploring our subconscious of colors and graphic images with characters we love to hate and hate to love.
666;In Sin City we have a story and setting that fits the medium that Rodriguez and Miller create.
667;He is beat, broken down and worn out, but understands his duty and will cross the line to get it done.
668;He loves her and will stop at nothing, no matter what the consequence, to seek equity in his eyes.
669;He is a cool clever guy that accidentally gets involved in a war.
670;The film follows these three stories but involves us in many others with vividly fresh characters played by Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett and numerous others.
671;the film recreates the film noir of the golden days where the characters on the screen acted as gods of cinema.
672;This film is visually stunning and the characters are just as extreme as the stories.
673;Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino give Sin City a touch of elegance and a bath of brilliance.
674;ray was ten times much better and the audio is ten times more better also.
675;The main characters supernatural ability to resist pain and injury is an unexpected and surprising story element for first time viewers.
676;Sin City is an amazing series of comic books with incredible stories of crime and vengeance and director Robert Rodriguez presents a 99 percent accurate depiction in his adaptation of the hit series.
677;Rodriguez sacrificed a lot for the sake of converting the series to the big screen and having Miller along with him directing at his side, they created one incredible piece of filmmaking that will surely become a classic.
678;Childish, ain't I?Rodriguez along with Miller at his side manages to capture the mood perfectly for the book with everything from the comic books adapted on the screen with pin point accuracy, and this comic book fan is pleased.
679;I loved the series, and was satisfied to see Rodriguez stuck true to the source material featuring a world comprised mostly of computer generated effects but manages to accurately capture the mood and dark atmosphere in which the tales take place.
680;The story is set with three segments, all intertwined with one another to make the fluid story of Sin City, all of which is topped off with an amazing all.
681;"ass Powers Boothe, all of which are mixed in the tale of Sin City
682;I'd have to devote a list to the number of stars who appeared in this film, but it is surely an ensemble piece that even made Jaime King look talented!
683;That's a feat in itself that Rodriguez and Miller accomplish.
684;The segment includes three good performances from Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and Nick Stahl who plays bad so, so good.
685;the storyboards for the film consisted of pages from the actual comic used, and it's like taking scenes from a movie on to a new movie.
686;Miller always prided himself in being a rebel.
687;Having had many bad experiences with Hollywood, he declared that he'd make his books like movies, and the man is brilliant.
688;Read his work on Daredevil, Batman, and this series, and you shall see.
689;You shall see, my friend.
690;If studio execs, my mortal enemy, hadn't jerked this guy around, he would have made an amazing director, and it took Rodriguez, another Hollywood stalwart to see that.
691;It takes brilliance to notice brilliance, and Rodriguez did much of the movie's work in his own home studio and really managed to pack a wallop of the movie for fans of both comics and noir, and Rodriguez doesn't alienate non.
692;Seriously, I can discuss this movie forever, but I'll spare you the extra reading.
693;noir for the new millennium baby, and one of the best comic book movies ever made that noir fans will also really enjoy.
694;Yes, the line above was clich , but I don't care, this movie rocked with excellent performances, great stories, great direction, and just a hip style that hasn't been achieved since """"Pulp Fiction""""."""
695;This movie kicks Hollywood in the nuts, and I hope they felt that.
696;HOWEVER, once again, cheers for an extremely visually stimulating experience and some priceless shots.
697;I have actually read and enjoyed Frank Miller's comics, and really loved the Kill Bill series.
698;I have to be honest and say I've never seen the comic that this film is based on.
699;If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would.
700;Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie.
701;this was what films were supposed to be, unique and spellbinding.

705;"I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that ""Sin City"" was being made into a movie, I shuddered."
706;in the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print.
707;The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.
708;This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation.
709;My entire hall and I watched this movie after our first snow day and It was amazing!!!!!!
710;This is a movie that will be loved forever.
711;It's not your tradational movie but that is what makes special.
712;I thought that Sin City was an instant classic.
713;I thought that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller had made an awesome movie.
714;I also thought that the guest directing of Quentin Tarantino was amazing.
715;1 or 2, I think that Sin City will be a great film for the ages.
716;Also, the cast all played amazing roles in the movie and the casting directors all picked the right people for the movie.
717;Here is my review about the casting and the directors job:First off, the casting call was an amazing job.
718;I thought that when I saw the movie that they looked actually like the real comic.
719;First off, I thought that the casting of Bruce Willis and Nancy Callahan as Jessica Alba was an amazing choice because he has the scar and he has the look and everything.
720;I think that this story was an amazing choice because Bruce going against the Yellow Bastard was an awesome scene and a story.
721;Goldie and Kevin were great casting calls for the movie.
722;i think that Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job making this a black and white movie with some color (kind've like the comic).
723;I watched it and it is way better than most of the movies that I have seen lately.
724;Great casting calls for all of the people and make sure that you go and you watch this movie because you will not be dissapointed.
725;rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity, and sexual content including dialogue.
726;I rate this movie 4&1/2 stars.
727;What are we all so politically correct that we have to set proper guidelines to make it a good movie?
728;The tone of the movie is very well done with the scenery of the set, the black and white vintage feel with emphasis of color on eyes, lips and other features that I feel are important characteristics that bring out the characters and style.
729;The mood and music is very well done!
730;Also an extremely good all star cast for the film.
731;Jessica Alba is supper hot, and so is Rosario Dawson in this film.
732;One of the best films of 2005 for sure!!
733;This movie fulfilled each of my desires for entertainment.
734;the cinematography was amazing, the actors/actresses were breathtaking, and the direction was uniquely capturing.
735;sin City is by far the best movie I have seen in Years!
736;This is an amazing two.
737;Director Robert Rodriguez brilliantly brings to life Frank Miller's graphic novels, and does not hold back with the development of these gritty characters.
738;This set is worth having strictly on the merits of the development of that character.
739;"For anyone who has a love for the making of films and the time consuming processes involved in the ""behind the scenes"", the bonus disc will satisfy your appreciation for the multifaceted areas of story telling."
740;holds barred, in your face, brutal, raw, and savage cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions.
741;The characters, heroes and villains and alike were seriously hardcore, and so real their presence was undeniable.
742;What I particularly liked was that the heroes were more like anti.
743;heroes, Marv in particular, whose character traits were morally ambiguous although ultimately one of the quintessential good guys.
744;my hats off to Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino for pouring their heart and soul into this incredible realization of a complex and unique tale of the classic good vs. evil.
745;Their passion for film making shows and combined with the incredible cast as well as the comic book look, they've revolutionized film making forever by combining heretofore unused styles and concepts.
746;Escapism at its best because it transports the audience from reality into a whole other world that is frighteningly alot like our own in many ways.
747;I liked the plot element of the church and government represented as these evil entities and what measures and ideologies that both institutions condone and sometimes embrace wholly.
748;It's obvious that the directors produced a labor of love, and the cast were immersed in their parts and totally dedicated to realizing Frank Miller's dream.
749;As Miller said himself, this film is a dream come true.
750;that aside, the film is brilliant on all levels.
751;I enjoyed the humor in this film, and it was nice with some comic relief in such a dark and disturbing setting.
752;If you're a fan of action films and comic books set to a solid, deep story, by all means see this film.
753;The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.
754;"The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction""."

756;miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience.

758;Filmmakers and friends, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino unite their perverse adolescent minds and together they bring Frank Miller's Sin City to vivid life in a stark and oppressing film, which will leave its viewers desiring a thorough shower in order to wash away the residue of the film's immoral characters.
759;Detective Hartigan has been tracking down a powerful senator's son, who kidnaps, rapes, and murders young girls.
760;Dwight is an enigmatic criminal with a soft spot for damsels in distress.
761;In his attempt to solve the mystery of her death and avenge her, he discovers a plot that leads to one of the city's most powerful families, corruption within the government, police force, and the church.
762;He pulls off his brutal revenge but he ultimately pays the price in the end.
763;these three tales interlock like pieces to a sinister puzzle, each piece bringing the audience closer to the story's completion, showing us the seedy underbelly of Basin City from multiple perspectives.

766;Sin City is absolutely phenomenal.
767;The acting is great and very reminiscient of older films, and the film has a dark, edgy, highly stylistic look to it (thanks undoubtedly to the comics, of course).
768;Black and white with instances of color works really well for the film.

775;why this movie got so much attention from people and critics alike beats me.
776;in all truthfulness, it was a REALLY good movie.
777;It was a REALLY good movie, and yet.
778;Its piercing action and racy dialogue.
779;once again, this film is REALLY good.
780;Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love.
781;Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together.
782;There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way.
783;People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation.
784;There are moments that seem influenced by past films.
785;A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off.
786;it is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre.
787;storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film.
788;`Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision.
789;Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen.
790;This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense.
791;Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X. men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material.
792;The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List.
793;like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through.
794;In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?)
795;This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true.
796;if this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts.
797;This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat.
798;It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride.

807;Its detail and style are unparalleled.
808;Nobody makes a film like this anymore, nobody ever dared, and it's a miracle the Weinsteins funded this one in the first place.
809;ray disc release got alot of positive press when the US version was yet unreleased.
810;The US version lives up to every expectation and is excellent in every respect.
811;One of my favorites, Sin City reminds me of back in the day when Madonna did Dick Tracy.
812;Love the colors in the movie too.
813;Not usually a big fan of ultra violent movies but this movie got me absolutely hooked all the way through.
814;This is a fantastic take on taking comic books to film.
815;Robert Rodriquez's understanding of the comic book medium is what makes this film so wonderful.
816;Even if you don't like Frank Miller's writing style, you have to appreciate the technical aspects of the film in adapting his stories to the screen.
817;So far most comic book films are just re.
818;created into a new story that is possible for both fans and new viewers to accept.
819;But with Sin City Frank Miller was involved as a director, so the stories stay pretty true to their roots.
820;Wonderful addition to my Blu.
821;Came on time and in the right condition.
822;I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.
823;I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.
824;Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.
825;And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.
826;The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.
827;and you'll be happy you did.
828;I saw the trailer in Scoresse's Aviator and about wept tears of joy at it.
829;What can i say?I'll keep it short and sweet because it really is this simple .
830;rodriguez and Miller have outdone themselves, pure genius and the extras are well worth the price of the disc alone.
831;A fantastic movie gets even better on this 2 disc special edition blu ray,complete with theatrical and director's cuts,both versions are great,with a few noticeable differences on the director's cut with Marv and Hartigan's stories and the ability to watch the stories seperately in any order you want with the director's cut.
832;Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.
833;and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.
834;"When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before
835;The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come .
836;Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.
837;and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.
838;just because Goldie was nice to him.
839;There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.
840;She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.
841;There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.
842;Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop.
843;Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.
844;The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it .
845;including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.
846;My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction"
847;The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.
848;all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.
849;It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.
850;It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life .
851;Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti.
852;Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.
853;"I'm a comic geek, pretty much as ravenous for comics as they come, so I REALLY wanted to like this movie
854;I don't how to articulate exactly the kind of artificiality that the film exhudes, but I would use a film like Kill Bill as a contrast: in that film, Tarantino is able to make a kung.
855;visuals"
856;If you did like it, you will love the comic, which is much better (though I still wouldn't put it at the top of my most recommended comics list).
857;SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.
858;The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.
859;For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.
860;In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.
861;The effect is stunning.Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.
862;The acting is quite good.
863;The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.
864;He belongs in this world.
865;He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.
866;I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.
867;It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.
868;Numerous good actors for this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels.
869;This special edition is a must have for fans of Sin City.
870;The DTS track alone, in my oppinion is worth the price.
871;"Love it or hate it, ""Sin City"" is an amazing technical breakthrough."
872;This is a rare example of special effects that are totally in service of the story.
873;I think it's worth a look for that reason, especially if you're a budding computer.
874;documentary is included as a behind.
875;It shows real contempt for the fans of this movie.
876;An intelligent plot and an interesting script.
877;At first the film would appear to be one that appeals to the effect loving star.
878;wars fan, but after watching you will be pleasantly suprised to see that it has quite an intelligent plot.
879;so if you're looking for a film that finally gives that goodie 2 shoes superhero a slap in the face, this is it.
880;Now,I've seen Hellboy and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,and those movies had a graphic atmosphere that made the movies so unique in nature,and their directors collaberated with the actual people who made the graphic novels,the movies look like scenes from the comic,and both had dark and unique settings.
881;it stands as a true translation of an individual product,something that every movie based on something else in the entertainment medium should do,in every case.
882;this is more of a man's dream film,a film that stands out as unique,with polish,nice scenes,and excellent cinematography,along with great direction,awesome soundtrack,and a great atmosphere.
883;I love the extra footage.
884;"The obvious thing about movie that is unique is the ""comic booky"" feel of the movie it is beautifuly redendered."
885;I would best describe this movie as cinematic chocalate.
886;You might feel bad a ingesting it but you sure do it enjoy it while it's happening.
887;I really enjoyed this movie becasue it was gritty and very true to it's graphic novel beginning.
888;Part pulp fiction, part film noir, part graphic novel, wholly original.
889;This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.
890;The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.
891;Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.
892;The women here offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.
893;well that's their own fault.
894;Sin City is a wonderful noir story (stories) with fantastic acting (it's based on a graphic novel with very one.
895;dimensional characters, they played the part well).
896;The direction is great with beautiful style.
897;"I enjoyed Sin City, but I didn't think it was a ""great"" movie."
898;Yes, the visual style was really innovative.
899;And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way.
900;Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.
901;And I really loved the music.
902;So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars.
903;One of the coolest things about this tres cool movie is, you can't pigeonhole it.
904;Punching, kicking and slashing its way through every genre imaginable .
905;chiefly film noir, comic, mystery, action, drama, romance, and thriller .
906;I loved it!It is based on author/illustrator Miller's series of graphic novels of the same name.
907;The plotlines include elements from the stories The Babe Wore Red, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and more.
908;Like the phantasmagoric storybooks, the lush yet stark look of the movie is achieved by using satiny black and white enhanced with splashes of color.
909;Early buzz has Miller's fans thinking that only Miller fans will glom onto the cinematic Sin City.
910;I'd never read or even saw one of his books in my life before viewing this dark delight, yet I was on board from start to finish.
911;It's only April 1, but I can easily say that Sin City is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.

925;SIN CITY is a film for discriminating and intelligent adults.
926;The imagining of the film, the production design, the cinematography, are splendid.
927;I give it one star for the great story line another star for it`s cast, another star for the way it`s is filmed (black and white with accents of color )very cool, another star dark for the and creepy musical score and the 5th star well.

945;It helps that Owen's segment was the best of the three and he gets to interact with Rosario Dawson and the rest of the prostitutes.
946;"standouts do include Owen and Del Toro (who has some hilarious scenes after a certain event happens), Willis doing a good job of playing the ""hard as nails with a heart of gold"" role that he often plays, and Michael Madsen as Willis' partner."
947;Madsen has one of the toughest jobs, as his dialogue is some of the worst, but he does a good job overcoming it.
948;Rosario Dawson also does a good job with what she has, though her final scene is a bit overplayed.
949;I can tell you that I enjoyed it.
950;The stories are interesting and the characters, while often over the top, are still engaging.
951;The acting fits the story for the most part, with the exception of Murphy.
952;I liked how Willis' story framed the other two, giving us both the beginning and end of the movie.
953;It can be a fun way to watch some brainless eye candy.
954;Still, if you like this sort of thing, Sin City is a wonderful example of the genre.
955;It has cool aspects and good actors, but alas it is still wack.
956;Well the wac is intact but the cool .
957;It must've been that book at the bottom of tyhe shelf, with the nicely drawn pictures that caused you to flip through it.
958;{After going over it with a friend of mine who loves it}, So I hope you understand and heed my warning when I say, at the end of the day its still wack.
959;The original theatrical version and unrated director's cut are presented here over two blu ray discs that are simply stunning to look at.
960;Highly recommended if your a fan of Sin City.
961;This is the best comic book movie because it is the comic word to word.
962;The actors are all good in their roles especially Mickey Rourke as Marv which is the perfect casting choice.
963;The direction by directors Robert Rodriguez and Sin City creator Frank Miller and guest director Quentin Tarantino bring Miller's comic book world to life.
964;Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez.
965;The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie.
966;And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also.
967;It does make me excited to see how Miller's other graphic novel, 300, will translate to screen.
968;"Sin City is an inimitable movie
969;the movie covers three stories knotted together to give the feeling of completeness.
970;This new approach has really made this movie very special"
971;this movie carries with itself a likable story, if you like movies based on graphical novel, then you can give it a shot.
972;"The way the story line weaves through ""Sin City"", makes it worth watching for adults."
973;and in the end, you will smile knowing that some men do care!
974;I'm brazilian and I was very happy when I found that there's a portuguese version .
975;I prefer the original audio, but I like to have all the options.
976;The R. e. u. version brings the stories separated, and the original version has 2 commentaries, one with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, and the other with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.
977;"explore option, with comparisons between the scene and the comics, and other stuff
978;Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the """"Batman"""" and """"Daredevil: The Man Without Fear"""" comic books."""
979;"in 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on ""SIN CITY"" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard."
980;"so, does ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" achieve perfection on Blu."
981;"vIDEO and AUDIO:""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen."
982;The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.
983;It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.
984;And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.
985;The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.
986;ray releases include that feature).
987;You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.
988;watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!
989;ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope.
990;picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.
991;This is optional and a nice touch.
992;The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool.
993;"Miller has lived ""SIN CITY"", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men."
994;But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.
995;But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.
996;Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.
997;Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.
998;Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat.
999;ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story .
1000;Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.
1001;Very nice addition to this Blu.
1002;There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.
1003;Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time.
1004;Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.
1005;"(7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis and The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" and ""Scanner Darkly"" hook up and enjoy the performance."
1006;(6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.
1007;So, he shows you how to make them.
1008;How certain props looked as real as the original to finding the right bow from the graphic novel in real life and obtaining it and using it for the film.
1009;ray, I'm just amazed how much of a difference High Definition really makes this film look and sound so incredible.
1010;This film is just right up there for one of the best releases on Blu.
1011;ray discs are just packed full of special features and enough to keep fans busy.
1012;The first disc alone gives you five ways to watch the film and each reason is just fantastic (especially if you are a big fan of the film and the graphic novels).
1013;The second disc was a great touch to add an unrated, recut version.
1014;it would have been nice to have the full theatrical film with the newer footage added to it but overall, the second disc gives you individual chapters and yet again, another way to enjoy this film.
1015;in the end, I really enjoyed the film and the Blu.
1016;top and both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have had their share of over.
1017;And just kudos to Robert Rodriguez who allowed Frank Miller to fully be in control of the film and working together with him and coming up with this unique and stylish film, the two work great together and I just hope to see a future collaboration with both men again.
1018;ray release that is just perfect in all four categories of film, video, audio and special features is quite rare.
1019;videophiles and audiophiles are just going to love this release while fans of the film are just going to go nuts over the amount of content included on both Blu.
1020;Frank Miller's SIN CITY is perfect and highly, highly recommended!
1021;so much of what we see is rehashed, refried, regurgitated stuff.
1022;Of course it's a comic book style, it's a comic book movie.
1023;There are 3 very distinct stories, all of them told in a spectacular fashion with stellar acting.
1024;this film is a beautiful transfer from Frank Miller's graphic novels.
1025;You can look at the panels of the graphic novels and see the exact scenes from the movie.
1026;Basically it's Pulp Fiction without the wholesome family etertainment value.
1027;the movie shines in dark wit and uber.
1028;But if you shut down the logic based part of your mind you'll dig it for it's awesome visuals and dark wit.
1029;The look of this movie is so great I consider it eye candy.
1030;I love how the movie was shot in front of the green screen (even though that's totally unethical movie making) to make the picture look just like the black and white world of Frank Miller.
1031;The action was also very good, especially the fight between Kevin (Elijah) and Marv (Mickey).
1032;If your a fan of the movie you'll love it, if your not you will still love it.
1033;Because a lot of the blood is computerized to look white.
1034;Most of the blood though is red or black, and it seems to flow from the characters like water a lot of the time and is all over the place.
1035;this is a cool ride.
1036;if this review was helpful, please add your vote.
1037;This movie was quite unique.
1038;everything Quintin touches, seems to be worth seeing.
1039;This movie is unlike anything you've seen so far.
1040;It's pretty wild how it really looks like a black and white comic book, but yet the characters are real.
1041;One who sees this film, can and will appreciate the cinematography and writing.
1042;enough said, it's a must see.
1043;I actually found the Sin City comics passable, but inferior to Miller's previous works.
1044;Filmed in Black and White with a splash of color here or there to accent specific elements.
1045;movies like Spider Man and X. men are very good movies.
1046;This movie does and it looks and sounds great with a great cast.
1047;This movie is definitely going to be a must have for me!
1048;"This is easily the most stylish film to come out since ""The Matrix."""
1049;"This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film ""Pleasantville."""
1050;Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.
1051;"As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances
1052;The female characters are primarily two.
1053;fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.
1054;There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.
1055;This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store.
1056;Pure Eye and Ear candy.
1057;Excellent cast of characters (Micky as Marv is PURE genius), and the storylines punch through hard and fast!
1058;I saw it in the theater with digital projection and I still found myself checking my watch.
1059;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1060;Obviously it's good to have the full disc with the original cut, and this is the one I generally watch but it was great to see the uncut scenes as well.
1061;The added graphic novel to the box set was a nice touch as well.
1062;Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
1063;First off, I loved the movie!
1064;Great stories, Great action, awesome visuals, and Gorgeous babes!
1065;I read the comics many years agoo and wass really impressed by the stark contrast that Frank Miller created using black and white on the visuals, ito emulate the mood of a decadent city.
1066;if you are a special efx buff, you will love this one as the director has shown you in the special feature session s how he used neon colours to create the contrast.
1067;It was so well done you think you are actually reading the comics itself.
1068;almost entirely CGI, it's actually beautiful and extremely well crafted.
1069;It's like one of those movies that looks like a cartoon, but with real actors.
1070;Someone really loved it into a movie.
1071;I will do anything and everything to make his rather short time on this planet as pleasant as possible.
1072;After all, he is my dearest, best, most wonderful and most significant friend.
1073;Sin City (the film) stands in a more complicated relationship to its source material, however.
1074;viewers, however, who have either familiarity with noir stuff or, specifically, Miller's comics, will find the film enjoyable and satisfying.
1075;(This implies, of course, that watching """"Sin City"""" in theater is probably more satisfying than watching it in a form in which the view can control the image delivery rate)."""
1076;"the performances of the players, for what it's worth, are sometimes fairly good, sometimes excellent, and sometimes bad, though for me ""good"" means that I'm not constantly aware that ""oh, that's Actor Y."" Hence, here, Mickey Rourke is excellent and Bruce Willis poor."
1077;the film is striking visually, and use of color is better than with the heavy.
1078;Likewise, the other differences in treatment may be largely to do with medium as well.
1079;"now that I think of it, I'm happy for Frank Miller with this work: he does a better job the second time around with the ""Sin City"" stories and milieu."
1080;In summary: a decent way to pass a couple of hours.
1081;Okay, so I have to be honest.
1082;"Let me be straights, I liked ""pulp fiction"" it had a story to it."
1083;Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore.
1084;knuckled fist of f@ck, fight, fury, fatalism and fun.
1085;"Throw in the visual intensity of characters like Mickey Rourke and ""Yellow Bastard"" (whose shine is so intense against the pulpy black and white storyboard you want to scratch and sniff the screen for sulphur) and you have one helluva ride."
1086;easily one of the most visceral films since CITY OF GOD.
1087;Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie.
1088;Sin City, based on Frank Miller's successful series of comic books of the same name is an intense thrill ride from start to finish.
1089;The film was directed by Miller himself as well as Robert Rodriguez, along with Quentin Tarantino, who directed a small segment of the final cut.
1090;After Hartigan's story has been told, Rodriguez and Miller move the action along to Marv, a man determined to find out who killed the girl of his dreams.
1091;"usually a film featuring strippers, prostitutes, extreme violence and explosions would be considered ""bad taste"" cinema, but Sin City is so beautifully acted, shot and directed that it is an astounding masterpiece."
1092;The cast are all on top form and the production values are tremendous.
1093;it gets both the style and the substance of noir, and tells real stories with the iconography.
1094;tough, smart and above all pragmatic.
1095;The movie is also a genuinely cynical, ambivalent meditation on the subject of corruption.
1096;Even Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the most vulnerable character whose heart condition that acts up at the most inopportune times, can survive a myriad of bullets and still live to tell the tale.
1097;"okey dokey, how about the characters
1098;Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan are the best and deserve better stories.
1099;the visuals though are completely brilliant, and it's probably worth the price of admission just to see them.
1100;Even though I've only seen samples of his work online, I can see Miller is a wonderful artist, and his visual work translates wonderfully on the big screen.
1101;There's tribute here to all the great film noirs of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's, and I'm sure Rodriguez and Miller screened several of them to the crew for inspiration.
1102;Truely one of the best cinematic features I've ever seen in my life!Somebody else said """"jawdropping video presentation"""" or words to that effect, and I would have to agree with that!"""
1103;Clearly an award winner in this department!Just writing this review and reading the other reviews, is making me want to rewatch it.
1104;This is, without a doubt, the lowest form of entertainment I have ever been subjected to.
1105;I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from.
1106;What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here.
1107;Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.
1108;I'm not really sure what movie you saw, but I thought the way Robert Rodriguez was able to bring Frank Miller's graphic novel Sin City to life was fantastic.
1109;I loved everything about this movie and I wouldn't change a thing.
1110;If you are a Frank Miller fan, which I know Frank has his haters, then you will love this movie as much as I did.
1111;I liked the way it was shot in mostly black.
1112;I loved the way they killed the pedophile twice in this movie, that was a great added bonus!
1113;The disc has great sound too!
1114;"That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film."
1115;But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.
1116;"But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style."
1117;All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white.
1118;Here and there we get a splash of colour .
1119;"the contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages."
1120;He also preserves the stark, black.
1121;Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process.
1122;most of the actors do wonderful jobs .
1123;But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood.
1124;Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard.
1125;Sin City is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie .
1126;An outstanding piece of work.
1127;Mickey Roarke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owens turns in stunning performances.
1128;I love the old cars, and how you never show exactly how they made the grapics.
1129;Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on.
1130;in my years of movie watching i have enjoyed a variety of movies that set the standard in regards to their genre of story telling.
1131;well pick a year I'm sure it will fit, and the special affects of the 90's and beyond, and rolls it all together into a visual masterpiece.
1132;In this movie you will see Mickey Rourke play one of his best roles ever as Marv.
1133;the one fine point i liked about Pulp Fiction was in the Karma to be found within the story, in that in the end everyone pretty much gets what they deserve and that sometimes the people we believe to be good really ain't so good at all, and it takes a unique, sometimes nasty form of justice to make things right.
1134;Such a point touched on in Pulp, is the center of SIN CITY in a nutshell.
1135;is it the best movie ever?
1136;no, but it may be one of the best of its kind.
1137;If you are the type that can't appreciate the story, just go into it for the sheer artistic and creative value this movie presents and i think you will be moderately pleased.
1138;but the short story makes for a nice start into the film.
1139;the visual effects are amazing, and when i went to see what the graphic novels were like, i found that the images and camera angles in the film were a spot.
1140;also amazing is the fact that it is as if each of the actors in the film were bron for their roles.
1141;up to play Marv, as he's done a fairly good job of messing up his own face all by himself.
1142;But he truly steals the show as the daring, revenge.
1143;Three strange but brilliant stories based in a whore.
1144;I am not usually a fan of comic books, but this movie was done so well that it didn't really matter.
1145;very absorbing, fascinating, outrageously twisted over the top graphic violence.
1146;"what's striking is just how utterly dark, no ""dark"" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into."
1147;star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well.
1148;world context and best of all doesn't try to be more than what it is.
1149;a supremely original and entertaining 2 hours!
1150;A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience.
1151;I am not familiar with Frank Miller'sSin Citygraphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co. director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard.
1152;This 2005 film takes a visual cue from 2004'sSky Captain and the World of Tomorrowby green.
1153;Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black.
1154;white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black.
1155;It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern.
1156;The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita.
1157;Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under.
1158;top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme.
1159;But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life.
1160;Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.
1161;disc One contains the 124.
1162;The first is with Rodriguez and Miller, who focus mainly on the book.
1163;screen translation and benefits from the author's perspective.
1164;The second has Tarantino and Willis join Rodriguez, and the focus turns to the technical aspects of the production even though Tarantino's contribution to the film is marginal at best.
1165;"There is an odd feature on Disc One, ""Sin."
1166;"city Interactive"", which allows you to pick characters and locations and get a timeline view of relevant events."
1167;This gives you the option to watch the film as an integrated whole or separately.
1168;Well written and choreographed with an obvious deep respect for the original author.
1169;I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection, you won't be disappointed.
1170;star (even the very best cinema has those who rate it low, for whatever reason).
1171;The way that each frame of the movie is like the frame of a comic book simply draws you into the experience.
1172;How you grow to love and hate the characters and become a part of their experience is amazing.
1173;I'll list a few: 1.
1174;Upon further viewing and analysis, one can find even more themes.
1175;This is one of my favorite movies.
1176;Honestly, I liked it, it's a big movie, ironical and funny.
1177;What You really need to know is just how successful Rodriguez was at realizing the vision of the original stories.
1178;He was able create a film that is visually stunning, brutal, humorous, grotesque, violent and yet beautiful and heartwarming.
1179;It's love and redemption in the gutter.
1180;top, surreal and at times slapstick.
1181;But this is a comic movie for adults.
1182;But if you can appreciate the beauty and grandeur of The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings and Spiderman, but also get a chuckle from the over.
1183;it also got some great actors and some well written dialogue.
1184;If you like stylish visuals, extreme violence, good dialogue and acting .
1185;There are enough reviews for this movie, but I'll say it was excellent.
1186;Violent and scary (at times) wonderful characters and the cast, superb.
1187;Watch it at the theater if you can, well worth the money.
1188;This is a visually stunning and thoroughly enjoyable film.
1189;the story and action are interesting enough on their own.
1190;In his most memorable, most powerful and possibly best performance to date, Willis portrays the character of John Hartigan, a near retirement cop that has one final mission to accomplish.
1191;The other two, led by Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen respectively, are quite interesting and more graphic, though their violence is relatively easy to take thanks to the results of the CGI special effects that are used whenever blood is supposed to be present and thus giving the film a somewhat surreal feeling.
1192;But this is heaped into the category of 'comic book film'.
1193;miller, who has always been known for shaking up our perceptions on the definitions of what can be expected in the comic book medium, stuck gold with this solid serialized title.
1194;packed with featurettes, a sharp 5.1 soundtrack, snarky and witty commentary, and some 20 minutes of additional movie, there's not much to not like about Sin City at all.
1195;"and I tried it
1196;star ensemble cast, lots of action, strong and sexy women, lots of action, gore, and lots of action.
1197;Someday I will make Jessica Alba mine.
1198;But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals.
1199;I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching """"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"""" although it has to be said that """"Sky Captain"""" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas """"Sin City"""" is a far cry from being kid."""
1200;And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue.
1201;"But again, that's all part of the fun of ""Sin City."
1202;i had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations.
1203;In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance.
1204;see this movie on the BIG SCREEN.
1205;This film is simply the best adaptation of a graphic novel in existence.
1206;"The ""cool"" visuals and over."
1207;"top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the ""That Yellow Bastard"" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism."
1208;up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly.
1209;Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise.
1210;This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings.
1211;If you are a comic/graphic novel fan then this story is one of the most talked about over the years and you'll appreciate the creativity of the makers in brining this gritty story to the screen.
1212;"For the simple fact that it is based on a ""comic"", many will love it regardless of the content."
1213;as with Pulp Fiction I'm one of the few who is in the middle ground.1) The movie is beautiful and creative.
1214;Unlike Kill Bill where the violence was just a joke that it moved from gross to ignoring it, this was plain violent for shock value I thought.3) The best part of the movie is Marv!
1215;The many reviewers have done an excellent job.
1216;For me, I like the intercut scenes from one story to the other.
1217;I think it's cool, compelling, especially the interviews with the filmmakers and the cast.
1218;edited version is that the theater version confuses you.
1219;Personally it's worth the price for the extras.
1220;This movie is a stunning piece of work, if it doesn't win any kind of Academy Award for at least special effects, then there's something wrong with the world.
1221;the cast is perfect with the slight exception of Alba, who while does a good job of acting, doesn't live up to Nancy in all her black and white glory, if you get what I mean.
1222;I ordered the first from and independent person selling on Amazon.
1223;I reordered it from the actual Amazon as a new product and had it in 2 business days.
1224;books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film.
1225;Sin City centers around 3 engaging stories.
1226;The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill.
1227;coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart.
1228;The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.
1229;The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top.
1230;The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted will stay in your mind long after the closing credits.
1231;The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact.
1232;Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic.
1233;catching visuals and the skill.
1234;studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances.
1235;Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character.
1236;That platinum hair, gorgeous figure and other.
1237;worldly presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan.
1238;Sin City is a work of art.
1239;The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005.
1240;and yet, what fun it is to look at, and how entertaining and involving it becomes.
1241;Sin City is a perfect example of the kind of film where the talents at work totally overwhelm the subject matter, resulting in a work of art that is much better than it needs to be but is ultimately chained down by the nature of its content.
1242;Director Robert Rodriguez, guest director Quentin Tarantino, and a splendid cast of not simply big names but iconic ones squeeze every inch of mileage they can get out of what amount to three stories that really only exist to string along scenes of ever.
1243;and yet, somehow, the sheer momentum and energy carries the viewer through.
1244;Every image oozes style and cool, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly badass that you end up getting swept away despite yourself.
1245;That's some achievement, given what actually happens on screen.
1246;still, in spite of what's been accomplished here as far as pure filmmaking goes, you can't help but wonder what the people involved in this project could have done with a more imaginative, if equally pulpy, set of stories.
1247;No doubt it is best comic adaptation ever made for the cinema, and I hope that remains for a long time!
1248;Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City is film noir for the 21st century.
1249;It's Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler for a new generation.
1250;The thin line between the two is at the heart of Sin City.
1251;brilliantly written by Frank Miller and brilliantly directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City is simply one of the most exciting, invigorating films I've ever had the pleasure to see.
1252;Movies like this are exactly why I love movies.
1253;Sin City is the cinematic art form at its peak.
1254;"It's bold, passionate, imaginative, striking and uncompromising
1255;However if you can stomach the violence, Sin City will be a unforgettable movie going experience.
1256;Fans of film in general and film noir in particular, fans of comics, and fans of pulp crime stories will find much to love in Sin City.
1257;i will not talk about the stories or the actors, save that Mickey Rourke delivers an awesome, Oscar.
1258;I will only say two more words: see it.
1259;Awesome, did they ever come out with Sin City 2.
1260;It is a classic that you don't want to miss.
1261;I will keep this short, but I just love this movie so much.
1262;One of the best movies that I have, the extended versions are great.
1263;The film was so visually astounding that the look alone was entertaining.
1264;The narrative was just as dark and haunting as the high contrast shadows and ominous unseen light sources.
1265;I wasn't shocked by the violence, as years of video games and other violent movies slowly developed a thick callous, but I was immensely entertained by this story set in the Urban equivalent of Dante's grim account.
1266;This obvious ambiguity of the film is also what makes it so alluring.
1267;Its purified escapist charm spills out all over the screen with beautifully placed yellows reds and pale cool colors set against a sea of cold steely greys blacks and whites.
1268;This movie is pure film noir.
1269;Yes, the movie is shot entirely in black and white with a few collors here and there that often peirce through the screen.
1270;The characters are facinating and incredibly rich with film noir qualities.
1271;And if there is one person who doesn't like this movie . . . well, let's just say that he's got a lot to learn about film noir.
1272;3 unique stories that all somehow conect with great acting and action.
1273;calm down guys, she keeps her clothes on the whole time.
1274;One of my favorite movies.
1275;I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first readBatman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Printwhich I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.
1276;I never read """"Sin City"""" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is."""
1277;It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.
1278;"my great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns""."
1279;wise that I've seen on a non.
1280;Definitely an all time classic.
1281;There story line for each individual is excellent and all woven together even better!
1282;Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite.
1283;It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.
1284;From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained.
1285;"The black and white is grand and enveloping
1286;slasher movie into cinematic genius.
1287;this film has everything, from the A. list of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh.
1288;It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.
1289;This is a classic of it's genre.
1290;Anything by Robert Rodriguez is good, fer sure, so there.
1291;Sin City is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time and I think it is will be a hallmark in the history of film equal to the use sound and color.
1292;Micky Rourke,and Bruce Willis are two of the most underated actors in America.
1293;Micky Rourke could have been one of the great American actors and here he shows what he could been.
1294;Jessia Alba has the present and the beauty of Gene Tierney.
1295;But for a film to be great it must make you as the viewer believe that it's real.
1296;So 5 stars ***** its as great movie and my brother just said that they should make it in color so you can see Jessica Alba in color and i punched him in the face!
1297;Edgy and dark story with more than decent plot.
1298;Truly the first movie to employ comic book/graphic novel cinematography.
1299;This one though, is one of the very best of the genre it helped spawn.
1300;well, i am satisfied with the service and the movie itself.
1301;great addition to my collection.
1302;You don't get any full frontal but you get a couple very perfect (almost too perfect) juicy melons.
1303;And fellas WOW some insanely perfect rear ends.
1304;But you'll know when you see the movie.
1305;Mix in a couple cool dudes with consciences and a death wish for your two protagonists and you got the story.You get an all.
1306;star cast so the acting is all top notch.
1307;Even Brittney Murfy who I find creepy and freaky is very cool in Sin City.
1308;the special effect and CGI are everywhere I love that shiz so I dug it and reveled in the lush artwork and city scrapes.
1309;the best character in this black and white fistfight of a movie was Marv played by Mickey Rourke.
1310;He was totally tough and likeable for a drunk, twisted, thug, loser, horny, smoke pipe, sadistic murderer.
1311;i recommend it check it out.
1312;Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.
1313;As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.
1314;Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.
1315;most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.
1316;the film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.
1317;despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.
1318;It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.
1319;Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.Yeah, that's it.
1320;audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.
1321;The movie works great, the price was unbelievable and I received it within the time period alotted.
1322;I happen to be on the demographic that loved the movie.
1323;While not perfect in any sense of the word, """"Sin City"""" is a truly visually engaging experience, and a wonderful adaptation of Frank Miller's namesake novel series."""
1324;Sure, that means I wasn't truly surprised by the end, but really, it's rare that you get to see sure a great adaptation from the page to the screen.
1325;"Atop that, I honestly think that ""Sin City"" is a fabulously shot film, almost every shot and angle is perfect, no flaws."
1326;creating what will probably be one of the best films of 2005.
1327;i'm sure we will now seen more films done in this way.
1328;one of the best recent comic.
1329;noirish, and even funny at times.
1330;Going to the movies can be so incredibly dissapinting these days.
1331;You can't help but be glued to the screen, all the characters are amazing.
1332;Marv is easy the tour de force of the movie, but there are also nice little surprises, for example the two thugs that speak to each other using elegant prose.
1333;Frank Miller Sin City finally gets made into a faithful comic book adaptation into a film.
1334;he was impressed and so are we with one of best comic book films there is.
1335;robert Rodriguez does beautiful job of transferring it into a film.
1336;in this story we have a unforgettable performance by Mickey Rouke as Marv.
1337;also a surprising performance by Elijah Wood as Kevin.
1338;i mean from a good old Hobbit to a crazy killer he gives very good performance.
1339;in this one we have Clive Owen having a American accent and doing very well and being cool in this story.
1340;also we get a special guest director in one of the scenes the one and only Quentin Tarantino he did it as repaying the favor of Rodriguez scoring Kill Bill Volume 2.
1341;this film has one of the best ensemble casts I have seen.
1342;from all the actors I have mentioned there are still so many to mention as well.
1343;they play there characters perfectly were casted very well.
1344;the film is identical in so many ways to the comic.
1345;the effects are amazing for being all on green screen and seeming so real.
1346;and really the thing that brings this film together a lot is the music.
1347;it adds to the suspense the noir feeling of the film woth some nice jazz stuff in the theme in the start.
1348;the score is one of the best ive heard.
1349;also Rodriguez directs,edits,scores and photographs the film.
1350;he is really a talented guy.
1351;doing all of that at the same time cooperating with another directors and scoring the music as well.
1352;this film I have to mention kind of violent.
1353;to tell you truth it has to be.
1354;what also great about this film is the use of voiceover.
1355;Extras will include a commentary with director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, a second commentary with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and a third commentary containing Austin Premiere crowd reaction!
1356;Also included will be a 15 minute film school with the director, a Movie in High.
1357;Completing the package will be four featurettes on the cars, special effects make.
1358;i think this one of the best films of the year.
1359;that features Marv,Dwight,Gail and everybody else in the world of Sin City.
1360;Sin City is a piece of art work.
1361;There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City.
1362;the acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful.
1363;It is absolutely one of the things that makes this film not only unique but gripping.
1364;this is an action film that warrants several viewings simply because you are going to be so caught up in how cool the film looks that you'll lose track of the plot.
1365;This is a violent movie that doesn't really have anything to say but it is stylish and well executed.
1366;This is a movie I would definitely keep away from kids.
1367;great visuals, innovative style, decent stories .
1368;The cinematic part, or perhaps more precisely, the post.
1369;It deserves ten stars: the film looks like a moving comics book.
1370;"It is a fully acted, ""normal"" movie that nevertheles looks stark and painterly and drawn and extremely expressive, as if it were complete animation."
1371;It's truly nicely done .
1372;I loved the visual aspects of this movie.
1373;Of course some may say, well, it's precisely what it's trying to be, its story is stylised just as much as its visuals.
1374;bottom line: I would recommend you check it out for the sakes of the visuals .
1375;"What you got here is a parody, mockery of the ""noir"" genre."
1376;I thought it would be hokey, but I really enjoyed it, even though it was a little dark and violent.
1377;other than thatits a great movie with an awesome cast.
1378;"Traditional Film Noir meets Robert Rodriguez in this epic dramatization of Frank Miller's Graphic Serial, ""Sin City""."
1379;The resulting picture is visually astounding and hauntingly dramatic.
1380;robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller take us on journey through three separate stories that ultimatley intersect through out the movie.
1381;Rodriguez reminds us that he is extremly good at what he does.
1382;To give it a modern twist, colors and cell phones were added in.
1383;top acting deserves an A+.
1384;It adds a fantasy feel to what otherwise would just be another dramatic movie.
1385;"Elijah Wood also shows us that he can be more than just a ""Hobbit from the Shire""."
1386;There is also some tongue.
1387;"viewers who enjoy this movie will also like both Kill Bill Movies and ""Pulp Fiction"", by ""Guest Director"" Quentin Tarantino and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" or ""Desperado"", Robert Rodriguez."
1388;He helped to inaugurate the adult graphics novels.
1389;coupled to nudity and R. rated dialogue.
1390;rodriguez assembled a powerhouse cast.
1391;Bruce Willis was first up, to boost the sales of the production and the star power.
1392;He was excellent in the film.
1393;Using CGI and live actors, Rodriguez was able to do most of the work in his homegrown studio in Texas.
1394;Miller created a world part pulp.
1395;were still treated with respect.
1396;More than an adaptation of Millers comic book art.
1397;it is literally his artwork brought starkly to life.
1398;The effect is original, violent, sexy, existential.
1399;"the film worked off three Miller ""stories""."
1400;He can think of this film as his return to the big time.
1401;His character, Marv, is perfectly fitted for this new genre.
1402;This may be Rourke's finest performance.
1403;everyone in the film was impressive.
1404;There has never been a more successful translation of a graphic novel to the screen.
1405;The entire mood of the picture, from cinematography, to dialogue, to acting, is a faithful and stunning conversion of the novel to the movie.
1406;Each carefully composed scene, each piece of artfully stunted dialogue, the stylised yet substantial characters, all ring true to the directors vision of an artful and accurate translation from one media to the other.
1407;I thought it was stunning and original.
1408;See theres this big guy named Marv.
1409;Not really a ladies man but he loved this hooker.
1410;She was murderd and Marv gets framed.
1411;Very good piece of film and one of Frank Millers best work as a comic creator and hey as a director.
1412;"With any luck Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" will inspire a new genre of filmmaking ."
1413;a literal union between filmmaking and the world of comic books/graphic novels.
1414;even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.
1415;"It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't ""get"" this world."
1416;the cast is nothing short of remarkable: Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly .
1417;Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.
1418;top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City.
1419;Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.
1420;The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.
1421;Sin City is one of the greatest films i have seen.
1422;Yes it is violent and such but a very good film with a lot to offer.
1423;Great action, acting, story, and amazing visuals.
1424;the acting was pretty good on all from Mickey Rourke,to Jessica Alba to Clive Olin.
1425;i never even read any of Frank Miller's book but the beauty of the movie is that you dont have to, though it would help.
1426;I was never really lost with the story and I was able to connect with all the characters.
1427;But it is a true art form.
1428;The images are dramatic, the acting intense, the plots thoughtful.
1429;The blacks and whites, the few colors, the details, the emotions, the heroism and villainy!
1430;"Violence, nudity, very adult themes: it's very deserving of the ""R"" rating."
1431;But for those who can stomach it, it's a must see.
1432;Entertainment value in this movie depends on how many times you can enjoy the same guy being killed over and over again.
1433;Atmospheric sets, and cinematic style are not enough to make a good movie.
1434;Ah yes, gorey special effects.
1435;"The difference between this pulp fiction and Tarantino's masterpiece (back when he still had an ounce of creativity) is that the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" had memorable characters and character development, interesting situations and dialogue, humour to round off the violence (and when the violence hit, it was scary!)"
1436;and an intriguing and clever story all the way through.
1437;MarvSin City is one of the best movies to come out in a while.
1438;It's visually stunning and fun to watch.
1439;The characters are larger then life and fun to follow throughout the movie.
1440;Using Frank Miller's character's and story, he creates a movie you can watch over and over again.
1441;Mickey Rourke is perfect and is without a doubt the best character in the film.
1442;Great action, Comedy, Story, Acting, and eye candy.
1443;this is great, revolutionary filmmaking, the ultimate film noir comic book come to life.
1444;Sin City is tremendous entretaiment,a good film but i don't think Sin City is better than other masterpieces works like Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill whoever i enjoyed the movie as well.
1445;This is a movie, of four crime stories adapted from Frank Miller's popular comics.
1446;It's just great fun to watch all these actors enjoying themselves and playing it staight for laughs.
1447;I wanted to dislike this film, I really did.
1448;Great story, fascinating and memorable characters, and well.
1449;I love love love Sin City.
1450;I enjoyed the various stories done in comic book style.
1451;I also enjoyed the extra features where Robert Rodriguez teaches how to make tortiallas and potato and egg tacos with jalapenos.
1452;And the story is amazing.
1453;Plus the black and white/ film noir style makes this movie very exciting.
1454;I have long been a fan of the Sin City comics and so I'm delighted with the movie.
1455;If you're a fan of the comics, you will love this movie.
1456;It really is that simple.
1457;"Unlike other ""double dips"" that are marketed as special/collector's/limited/extended edition, this is a release that truly delivers."
1458;Violence is omnipresent and valorised.
1459;This movie is an absolute blast!
1460;The first one is concluded at the end.
1461;Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!
1462;Sin city is one of these films you will never be able to forget due among other things, its original style with smart blinks respect the Noir genre but told, spattered and hovered by those dark, bizarre and tragic atmosphere where no one is safe about nothing and where in every step you take, may lead you to the same entrails of the hell.
1463;establish some sinister state of things to its place of origin.
1464;But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own .
1465;Robert Rodriquez did a brilliant job with this movie and cast.
1466;Mixing comic book with real life.
1467;I thought the Mickey Rourke character was so well done by both Rodriquez and Rourke.
1468;For me, this movie is about cinematic art.
1469;The back story on production and history of original comics is great.
1470;Being able to go in order gives the film a better flow
1471;books and still, she falled in love with this one.
1472;"That says a lot about the movie so for me, it's the best ""comic."
1473;I know it's full of violence but in the end, the movie is about love and frienship.
1474;Maybe you'll fin a big surprise.
1475;It takes a few minutes to become engrossed but the wait is well worth it.
1476;on the other hand, Micky Rourke is great.
1477;Love this version that you can watch each story on it's own, and that it has a volume of the graphic novel included.
1478;Will definitely recommend this to my friends.
1479;So, you watch movies to be entertained and that's what you get with this movie.
1480;Still, it was good enough we are planning to watch it again.
1481;somehow it's pure comic in static pictures put together to make super dynamic movie.
1482;special mention is Mickey Rourke as Marv who is great, just great.
1483;I loved watching this film.
1484;The style was unique and the special effects were pretty awesome.
1485;"com's editor, David Horiuchi, found the film to be ""unquestionably the most faithful comic."
1486;this film has got to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate its artistry.
1487;It's very entertaining to watch, even though it gets overly gory in some scenes.
1488;this movie is totaly grate, special fx, script, adaptation, the edition of the storys keep the atention of all public.
1489;if you like action movies, this is one of the best.
1490;I loved this movie on the big screen and I love watching it on the bus on the way to work on my PSP.
1491;I ordered it through Amazon, not a seller, and as usual, it came exceedingly quickly and in perfect condition.
1492;the movie is just great.
1493;It's a grown up film and if you're a grown up into good directing and the comic genre, it will appeal to you immensely.
1494;If you want to know about shopping through Amazon, it's great too.
1495;very timely and with little muss and fuss.
1496;One of best movies ever made for dialouge and storylines.
1497;The actors amazed me in the whole movie and I watched the orginal 2 hour version then watched the extended cut compare it to 2 hour version and actually enjoy the extra scenes because they added to the storyline.
1498;There is also plenty of eye.
1499;candy for boys and girls alike.
1500;It is the very best of the genre.
1501;The MAJOR stylistic problem is that in the film noirs, the camera was an observer, so the snappy dialogue, gravely voices of the men and sweetheart tones of the femmes and broad gestures of each gender were prominent and provided 'space' to be savored and enjoyed.
1502;very unique and a nice surprise.
1503;This type of moving isn't for everyone but is right up my alley.
1504;This animated comic book is a marvellous gem that we should all see, watch and scrutinize several times a day to convince ourselves that the world has reached a no.
1505;The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light.
1506;The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds.
1507;The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though.
1508;Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch.
1509;Ir is fascinating to see all those super.
1510;heroes die and revive periodically.
1511;But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well.
1512;the protagaonists, although far from perfect and ideal, genuinely want to do good and right in a world where virtue is rare.
1513;Fighting back often means making the powerful suffer.
1514;Is such a world so far from the reality?The movie is bold in its search for the truth of the human heart.
1515;Can a good cop overcome his irresistible attraction to a voluptuous 19 year old whom he has saved from rape only 8 years earlier?The protagonists and villians are highly unique.
1516;Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Marv and deserves an Oscar nomination.
1517;this movie hits on all cylinders in its bold attempt to provoke thought and passion in its viewers.
1518;This has to be one of the best movies to watch on blu ray!
1519;It has plenty of action and good acting.
1520;SIN CITY could be one of the best movies I've seen in 2005.
1521;He was brilliant in this movie and handed in one of his best performances.
1522;The performances were all excellent.
1523;I also love the comic book feel of the movie, the direction and the overall darkness of it all.
1524;What color is shown, at random moments throughout the movie is ingeniously crafted to the storyline.
1525;While spawning off into several stories, the plotline was great, and kept me hating that the movie was going to end.
1526;You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen.
1527;Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.
1528;It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.
1529;Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.
1530;I've Seen it several times.
1531;Very dark and violent but fun.
1532;I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
1533;He has one facial expression for everything.
1534;Third, the white brightness of the movie really bothered my eyes.
1535;Great movie, just a pity that it is so lightweight in terms of extra material.
1536;generated locations to give it that comic book look.
1537;mickey Rourke returns to the silver screen.
1538;"Despite the posted opinions of several reviewers that ""you'd have to be a(n) [insert derogatory remark here] to enjoy Sin City,"" it still has an overwhelmingly high rating here."
1539;"My girlfriend, who is simultaneously a strong, independent woman and an unashamed ""girly girl,"" really loved this movie."
1540;Then I gave her the comics to read, and she loved them as well.
1541;Film noir has plot twists.
1542;crosses, bleak worldview, complex character relationships, high.
1543;But apart from him, it seems that every fan of Miller's comics is hailing Sin City as the ultimate comic book adaptation.
1544;in my opinion, Sin City is the perfect comic book movie, painstakingly adapted from one of the most powerful comic book series in the history of the medium.
1545;but hopefully, I've done a sufficient job of explaining why I think this is a great movie, why I will always have a place in my heart for it, and why I'm eagerly awaiting the next Sin City film.
1546;this review was written by a well.
1547;This is my favorite movie ever.
1548;When I first started watching this film, it was breathtaking.
1549;I got really giddy, knowing/not.
1550;The movie is so amazing, I could barley contain it all.
1551;"And, whats more shocking than the ""graphic violence"" is its moments of heavenly grace and beauty."
1552;Seeing such a desolete city, and then seeing a gorgeous angel, it is very stimulationg.
1553;disc set will feature both the 124.
1554;Bonus materials will include commentary with directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, a second track with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and a third with the Austin Premiere crowd.
1555;Movie looked a lot better in the previews.
1556;This is the best of its kind (by that I mean a dark, violent noir in which bad guys are sent to hell by less bad guys).
1557;Not only does it excel in the visual presentation that everyone praises, it also features some truly interesting characters with whom you can profusely empathize.
1558;The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books.
1559;In the usual system the highest mark was 6, 4 was pass.
1560;I give this movie the mark .24.
1561;connected scenes for various people in a wild city.
1562;Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.
1563;"Whether it's the blue eyes of an ""innocent"" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film."
1564;It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.
1565;"A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and ""order"" is preserved."
1566;the 3 separet storylines didnt really intersect so it was never really intresting i was very disapointed I will give it three stars for originallity with the comic book look.
1567;Not only is Sin City the best Film Noir style graphic novel ever, the fact that Rodriguez could make such a faithful adaptation to film is really amazing
1568;Yea this movie was great, 2 friggin awesome love stories and a great revenge story could ya ask for more?
1569;If you liked the comics, you'll love the movie, if you like action, you'll like the movie, if you just like seeing people get what they deserve and the not.
1570;From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic.
1571;The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic.
1572;What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end.
1573;If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors.
1574;This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi.
1575;Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi.
1576;talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films.
1577;beautiful women, guns, blood, fighting, humor(mild), just all around action.
1578;this delivers a great intertwined stories that keep you on the edge of your seat.
1579;The is a freakin' awesome movie.
1580;At the same time this is the most faithful comic book/graphic novel adaptation ever put to the big screen and it's made only better by that fact.
1581;I went into this as a fan of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.
1582;(I'm one of those people who is more of a fan of the film makers than the stars who act in their films.)
1583;Sure, it's in black and white, but the splashes of color mixed with the black and white give you a new way to look at the dingy world of Basin City.
1584;Among the best in this movie are Mickey Rourke as the aforementioned Marv, and a brilliant Benicio Del Toro as a crooked cop who seems to somewhat enjoy a very interesting car ride with Clive Owen in the one scene directed by Quentin Tarantino.
1585;and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine here, big time.
1586;She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why?
1587;Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it.
1588;life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro.
1589;bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role.
1590;Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend.
1591;This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.
1592;moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best.
1593;"The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he ""meets his maker"" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!!"
1594;His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least.
1595;robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.
1596;Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done.
1597;i can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season.
1598;This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best.
1599;So you can bet I'll be first in.
1600;action rating.5 stars, Amazing gun.
1601;fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one.
1602;Sin City was an amazing film, first off.
1603;it's a wild, dark, over.
1604;buster of a thrill ride, an exciting, visually innovative film that left me gasping and raises comic.
1605;book films to a new level of artwork.
1606;minute schools and other good stuff.
1607;This disc contains an incredible film, but that's about it.
1608;Great movie, the special features are very interesting.
1609;Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black.
1610;action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand.
1611;novel vision to the screen as could be imagined.
1612;Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen.
1613;More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style.
1614;It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism .
1615;style noir detective fiction .
1616;"All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers
1617;As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point.
1618;Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film.
1619;I love Frank millers's books and this movie translates well to the screen.
1620;With its amazing cast, the look of it remains exceptional, a high.
1621;Entertaining, Sexy, comic and ultra.
1622;A stunning explosion of black and white with splashes of red.
1623;Well, it has a great cast, direction, plot, genre.
1624;hashed with new actors, but Sin City stands apart.
1625;to finish up, if you even REMOTELY like movies that have cool plot twists, violence and take you on a slick thrill ride, watch this movie.
1626;love the style, down and dirty characters, this brings neo.
1627;The biggest, nastiest, and most faithful comic.
1628;book film brought to stark, gritty life might also happen to be one of this year's best films.
1629;the most soulful story goes to """"The Hard Goodbye"""", with Mickey Rourke giving a career."""
1630;"in ""Sin City"" men are animals, and women the fodder for them."
1631;That Yellow Bastard is the bookending story: introducing the film and closing it.
1632;Obviously, Bruce Willis takes the reigns in this tale.
1633;Sin City is basically a madmen's cinematic experiment gone horribly right.
1634;just like all the best film noirs.
1635;"Who knew that a premier artist and a superior technician could create a ""City"" that."
1636;breathes its own denizens.You can taste this film between your teeth.
1637;This is a top notch blu ray release and will be the one I pop into my PS3 when I want to show off my system.
1638;there are a plethora of bonus features included.
1639;Some of the best ones are exclusive to the blu.
1640;ray version including an interactive comic book which is very creative in its execution.
1641;i loved Sin City when I first saw it in the theater, but the extended cut is superior and the way the directors intended.
1642;When I saw it in the theatre, I loved it.
1643;Lots of gore, great story, loads of action, the characters.
1644;Amazon always offer such a variety of products with really good deals.
1645;I'm very happy with the site and I shop here often.
1646;Frank Miller's graphic novels come to vivid life, until Rodriguez and Miller's hands.
1647;A violent, sexy wild ride, with lots of humor.
1648;ray finally is the definitive version of a now cult.
1649;Good luck with this one.
1650;"Also, fans will recognize the opening scene, as its the short story ""The customer is always right""."
1651;This film is amazing beyond description.
1652;The msot faithful comic book adaptation EVER.
1653;Robert Rodriguez himself stated that there WILL be A Special Edition coming later.
1654;It was film noir at its finest.
1655;The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice.
1656;the movie was a unique and fun experience.
1657;This movie was really strange but good at the same time.
1658;though the content is mature I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.
1659;All I knew about it that it was unique, due to all the hype.
1660;Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future.
1661;This trio made a gritty masterpiece of this underground comic book hit!
1662;i mean if you've seen the trailers in the past you knew that something new and excitingly was coming.
1663;In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream.
1664;white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences.
1665;"at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose ""Pulp Fiction"" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right ."
1666;"In essence, ""Sin City"" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling: great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption."
1667;This was a great movie!
1668;I suggest getting it, it is one of those movies you will want to watch over and over.
1669;This was one of the best comic.
1670;I bought this because the description said that it came with playing cards and poker chips.
1671;Sin city was an amazing movie and I could not wait to own it.
1672;In a perfect world, the Special Edition would be the one released in two weeks.
1673;Thank you man for this movie.
1674;(I was right: the special edition kills.)
1675;Great movie, the ability to watch the story in order is a pretty nice feature of the extended edition.
1676;I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City.
1677;it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action.
1678;The cast is great too.
1679;Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.
1680;So he has to set to make things right.
1681;"Willis ""who's also the best he's been in awhile"" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard."
1682;So he has to protect her one more time.
1683;this movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement.
1684;I, being one who never read the Sin City comics, thought this movie was suprisingly good.
1685;I would recommend this movie.
1686;And I loved this edition until the blu ray version came out, because, let's face it, it's looks a helluva lot better on blu ray.
1687;But this set did come with some fun goodies that the blu ray didn't.
1688;So if you want some fun extras to go along with a great movie, pick up this set.
1689;I had gone to the movies that evening, honestly, with relatively high expectations.
1690;Surprisingly, I recognize his angel.
1691;girl from the teen movie, Slackers, in which she played a sweet, blond girl.
1692;Yet, it is undeniable how chilling Elijah Wood's role as Kevin the cannibal is.
1693;Miller evidently relies on shock value to capture the audience.
1694;There is more spark and whimsy in his fight sequences and character interactions.
1695;Nick Stahl is refreshingly evil and rotten as (.)
1696;Honestly, I expected to be more dazzled, but the undertaking was still admirable.
1697;The cyclical pattern of narrative that occur at the beginning and end also added a nice touch.
1698;First of all, Frank Miller should be Freud's patient.
1699;rodriguez was far from the ideal director for the film.
1700;With the pop culture savy of Tarantino, the film would have been gracefully executed in a fashion that speaks to us of the dated aspects of the narrative, along with the modern spectacles, with a whimsical flare.
1701;"That being said, ""Sin City"" is a great ride of a film."
1702;You can tell the actors involved (especially Rourke, Murphy, Dawson and Owen) are having a great time when they're up on the screen.
1703;This movie is every actor's dream, to go overboard, and many of these people are relishing their moment to do so.
1704;Also, the look of the film is completely compelling.
1705;It is a near perfect comic.
1706;Not for everyone, for sure, but great for the people it's aiming to please.
1707;This movie is not only amazing visually speaking, but the story lines are incredible!
1708;The second part of the first story is put at the very end of the movie (which I thought was a great way to do that).
1709;Let's just say that That Yellow Bastard part 2 is the best part of the movie.
1710;But it's still good and visually appealing as well.
1711;This movie has some of the most adult themes of any movie based off a comic series.
1712;From the opening scene the film is arresting and hypnotic, the imagery used by Rodriguez in bringing Frank Miller's 2.
1713;dimensional comic into a 3.
1714;dimensional realm is absolutely perfect, especially crediting the select moments in which the film was translated into a streaming animated comic.
1715;the opening scene already features two very accomplished actors, Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, and was shot even before the actual film was greenlit.
1716;This scene was shot without Frank Miller's concent in order to persuade him into allowing a full.
1717;length feature to be made, and thankfully it was a success.
1718;The finished product was something that I believe comic fans and movie.
1719;goers alike will find mind.
1720;bogglingly stunning for years to come.
1721;But they won't have just this film to chew on, Sin City 2 has already moved into pre.
1722;stylishness of it all just makes you want to go back and watch it all again.
1723;Out of all the characters in this translation, he played the role with such ingenuity and twistedness.
1724;While some of the content is implied rather than over the top and in your face, it still does go, well, over the top, which is why the adult audience will get more out of it.
1725;You have to let yourself go with the flow and enjoy the comic.
1726;It just isn't bound by the laws most action films are, it really lets go and takes you on one heck of a wild ride.
1727;as if the main characters weren't enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, there is an enormous all.
1728;out awesome job in bringing the character to life, and this is a role that I will always know and respect him for.
1729;I don't know if I've ever heard of another film that had as many accomplished actors as this one, and it just goes to show you how much of a fan base this kind of film really has, and how it continues to draw fans from around the world.
1730;This amazing movie was renewed on Blu.
1731;With the extra features and added scenes this is one a fan of the series must own.
1732;I found this movie excellent.
1733;But I really loved it's use of colors/cinematography.
1734;And it had great special effects and a great story/plot line.
1735;great movie just like I remenber
1736;I was impressed with the visual style, and I liked the look of the movie, the sound of the movie, the hard bitten over the top language and action of Sin City.
1737;I admired what the director, Robert Rodriguez did in bringing Frank Miller's graphic novels to life.
1738;I'm even more impressed and I like the movie a whole lot more.
1739;This is the way I want to watch the film.
1740;This is a very interesting look in how this man makes his movies.
1741;This is the Green Screen version of the movie and Rodriguez introduces it, saying that he sped the film up 300 times or so in order that we can watch the entire movie in 10 to 15 minutes, but it gives us the chance to see how little the actors had to work with and how much work went into getting what we see on screen to actually be there.
1742;This is a neat feature and it is remarkable how good of a job the actors did with so little on set.
1743;We see some of what Tarantino says to the actors, what actually made it into the movie, and how the actors work and figure out how to play a scene.
1744;This is another great feature.
1745;another feature is the Sin City concert.
1746;Surprisingly enough, Willis is quite good as is his band.
1747;The last feature on disc two is a 10 minute cooking lesson from director Robert Rodriguez.
1748;overall this is an excellent set that really is worth owning if you are at all a fan of Sin City.
1749;This set does the movie and the books proud.
1750;which makes it worth seeing.
1751;Although it drags a little, the vision and style keep you along for the ride.
1752;Say what you want about this movie but Sin City is a gift that keeps on giving.
1753;Tragically stupid dialogue throughout but just a flawless execution of filmmaking staying truthful to the source material.
1754;It's very artistic, with a lot of plot and story.
1755;There are 4 stories in this movie, and a few of them intersect.
1756;Sin City is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color.
1757;The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough.
1758;There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel.
1759;Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings.
1760;there are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.
1761;heroes fighting against incredible odds.
1762;A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment.
1763;That compulsion makes it a good movie.
1764;There is little overt sexual activity but lots of sexy, half dressed women, mostly hookers and strippers.
1765;Carla Gugina play Lucille the parole officer and was excellent in a small part.
1766;I hope we see more of her in the future.
1767;Mickey Rourke as Marv is easily the most compelling character in the movie.
1768;"But it is a rising genre I'd call ""nouveau comic book noir""."
1769;That Yellow Bastard part 1 tells us how hard.
1770;Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects.
1771;scene shot in glorious black.
1772;The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film.
1773;Co. starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect.
1774;explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well.
1775;a must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films.
1776;boiled cynical characters and bleak sleazy settings), excellent
1777;Quick response received on time and product was in good shape truly recommend seeing this movie none quite like it.
1778;This is an outstanding film .
1779;I'm a huge fan of Frank Miller's and I loved this flick.
1780;Thank you Amazon, I'm a big fan of yours!
1781;The story line is fit for only the insane and serial killers to love.
1782;This picture has so many gruesome characters and plots it is mind boggeling.
1783;This character segways into a bishop, who also enjoys eating the bodies of the women with his friend.
1784;"Rodriguez (the director) is proud of this work and my only response is ""God help us."""
1785;This movie is one of the best comic book movies out there.
1786;I recommend this movie to anyone who like a good action movie or just a good comic book movie
1787;The cowboy bar dance marks a moment in pop culture.
1788;at it's core, Sin City is sitting on top of the powerful thrumming engine that is film noire.
1789;Sure it's uniquely colored, sure it's got an amazing cast, and sure this movie was scripted by the unholy hand of fate itself for Mickey Rourke, but it's appealing because it taps our fantasies.
1790;"See this movie and quietly smile as Rourke pulls off ""nullo"" on a big screen in theatres across america."
1791;This is one of the best comic book inspired films released to date.
1792;unlike other films that try so hard with special effects that actually destroy their integrity,the ways and means that it is done in this format only enhances it.
1793;dark,gritty,interesting characters all intertwined in one way or another with the main story.
1794;for those of you who did not see this movie on the big screen,you are in for a real treat.
1795;i need not mention the very sexy and beautiful Jessica Alba.
1796;This movie is friggin amazing, especially if you are into killin and prostitutes with submachine guns.
1797;This movie contains a slew of extremely talented actors and directors who give a knock down drag out preformance.
1798;There's a plethora of comedy in this movie as well, even though most of it is subtle.
1799;The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie.
1800;This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work.
1801;It is a might fine film that can put you on a roller coster ride through the place that is called Sin City.
1802;culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself.
1803;the film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels.
1804;Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over.
1805;movies is great has good action and lots of women.
1806;It can keep you glued to your seat, watching a spectacle and even make you glad you spent whatever you spent for it.
1807;and all delivered in a matter of fact, self.
1808;abstract visual style, for instead of photographing the performers of these rituals naturally, or realistically, the film utilizes the look of the 'adult' comic, by severely restricting color.
1809;nevertheless, this film is entertaining as simply a series of vivid, masturbatory fantasies of a vividly and purposefully ghastly nature.
1810;It makes for an astringent kind of pornography.
1811;Nevertheless, their performances are hypnotic.
1812;"Thanks to the power and popularity of Japanese Samurai movies and Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, the genre has changed
1813;It has become crueler, more intense and utterly fatalistic.
1814;the sound is equally impressive.
1815;it so perfectly matches what was shown in the theatres that it really does this excellent film justice.
1816;which is great, because the film truly is visually stunning.
1817;This is the best graphic novel based movie that i have ever seen.
1818;the acting is great and it is extremely accurate to the books and is an all around great movie.
1819;i highly reccomend this movie to fans of the books, action fans and fans of crime movies.
1820;a plus is that it is action packed and has great acting.
1821;This movie is a dream come true.
1822;This movie brings his world to life perfectly.
1823;Frank's style is basically the natural progression of film noir.
1824;With that in mind, I would define Frank's style as Super Noir and it is a beautiful thing.
1825;This is one of the slickest pieces of film making I have seen in a long time.
1826;I love how the film is done all in black and white with color being used only when neccesary, mostly in the case of blood or the color of a character's eyes.
1827;The film reminds me very much of portions of the graphic novel that I have seen.
1828;The way each stories weaves in and out of each other reminds me of a comic book.
1829;This film has one of the most diverse casts I have seen.
1830;A unique blend of both old school actors (Rutger Hauer/Bruce Willis/Powers Boothe) and up an coming stars (Alexis Bledel/Jessica Alba/Rosario Dawson).
1831;Because he has truly become Marv and plays him well.
1832;In fact it is integral in telling each story.
1833;I highly recommend this film and you will not be disappointed and I am looking forward to a sequel.
1834;In my opinion this was a good movie, but in now way deserved all the hype.
1835;It had some powerful camera.
1836;work like The Spirit, Watchmen, The Immortals and 300 did.
1837;This film was brilliant in every aspect of the word
1838;The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.
1839;Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.
1840;created them as faithfully as possible.
1841;the film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.
1842;heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).
1843;as the movie Adaptation tells us .
1844;or just movies with an original voice .
1845;Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character.
1846;driven graphic novels of recent years.
1847;the best actor in the movie .
1848;And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny.
1849;the direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen.
1850;this is a great action movie done in a very stylized black and white fasion.
1851;it's well worth the viewing.
1852;this is a great movie!
1853;If you are a fan of the comics (which I am) you will be happy to know that Sin City the movie stays closer to the comics than any other movie based off a graphic novel.
1854;The feel of the movie is completely true to the source.
1855;Perfect touches of color in a film.
1856;noir black and white are both symbolic and appropriate"
1857;This is Sin City at its finest, and not one thing could have been better.
1858;I have been a huge fan of these kinds of movies for quite some time.
1859;I just love the gritty style it brings.
1860;Sin City is an amazing piece of work.
1861;Rodriguez brings the comic book to life beautifully and Frank Millers writing of the books is just out of this world.
1862;I strongly recommend you see this film.
1863;Once i saw this edition being released i sold the other one and bought this one.
1864;The special features are amazing however the new scenes hardly add anything to the movie.
1865;bottom line, this is a fantastic movie.
1866;Get out and see it now!!!!!!!!!!!!
1867;Sin City is an excellent movie with a great cast and a great story, actually 3 stories combined that makes one of the best movies of the year so far.
1868;The name tells the truth of this movie!
1869;They also suited this movie very well but without great actors and actress, I had ever enjoyed this film so much.
1870;hard, ungly and interesting person.
1871;Rourke really plays his role with unbelieveable emotion and skill.
1872;in my mind, Willis has always been a good action actor.
1873;In this movie he has even better survivor than Die Hard films.
1874;everyone remembers Elijah Wood on the Lord of the Ring movies.
1875;he can't escape it but luckily they were amazing films.
1876;sin City shows that Wood can also play a wicked man role well.
1877;He don't speak at all but facial expressions, fast movements, sharp nails, dark personality and his animal fried makes his role unique.
1878;i liked also woman characters.
1879;Jessica Alba ( Nancy Callahan) danced beautifully and looked captivating.
1880;finally, this movie was worth of watching and I am going to see it again same day.
1881;Robert Rodriguez's best movie in a outstanding Blu.
1882;Audio and video are fantastic.
1883;Thank you Amazon for another excellent job.
1884;Every second of this movie bled style.
1885;From its cool charicters, neat presentaion, super acting, even to corny nior.
1886;film like voice overs ad a lot of depth to the people and you know what they are thinking when stuff is happening to them.
1887;Its an awsome way of story telling.
1888;I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.
1889;on to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.
1890;"Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" that attempted the same trick."
1891;"all gripes aside, ""Sin City"" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire."
1892;With alot of action, comedy, hot girls, and just such a really great movie.
1893;ramos, and Katherine Willis are hot.
1894;An incredible cast in a swampish, dark and disturbing movie.
1895;Ok, with that out of the way, I loved this movie.
1896;The writing/dialog is fantastic, and the acting is perfect.
1897;Some complained about Jessica Alba seeming lost, but I thought she fit her role just fine.
1898;Now, here comes the REAL good stuff.
1899;, and the special edition they were putting together at the time of the interview.
1900;"This special edition really will be one, with TONS of extras, and interviews, not just a ""making of"" and a cast bio."
1901;Just love getting lost in the story!
1902;Its all about being a spectacular film.
1903;It has the most originality since Citizen Kane.
1904;The color scheme, the direction, the stylized violence, the truly well thought out characters all combines to make this one helluva film.
1905;Also the monologue of the characters was very helpful, and lent the movie even more of that comic book feel.
1906;The characters were able to tell us, in their own words what was going through their minds.
1907;to tell you the truth I was starting to wonder about Rodriguez, after Desperado and Once Upon A Time.
1908;But that is all behind us now Robert, if you ask me he has made the best film in the 20 years.
1909;Like Kurosawa you have once again risen above the ashes, to bring about a cinematic masterpiece.3 stories from Frank Miller's Sin City were chosen to make their theatrical debut.
1910;The movie is far beyond outstanding.
1911;It truly opens your mind to the darkness in the world of Frank Miller.
1912;The visuals are incrediable followed by an amazing cast.
1913;Robert Rodriguez did an amazing job with bringing this one completely together.
1914;But it fits the piece well and you become accustom to the language in no time.
1915;This work of art is definately worth seeing.
1916;The violence is intense even in its cinematic glory.
1917;If you were a fan of kill bill volume 1, you'll truly enjoy this movie in its noir setting.
1918;Personally supervised by Quentin Tarantino, Sin City is a masterpiece of cinematography with a perfect cast and action that will put you on the edge of your seat.
1919;This original unique style of filming accompanied with a narrative voice allows the viewer to willingly suspend their suspense of disbelief and enter into the world of Sin City.
1920;Bruce Willis, who plays Hartigan, is a burnt.
1921;what an extreme character compared to Wood's Frodo from Lord of the Rings, but he pulls it off perfectly!
1922;This was perhaps the best action movie I have seen all year.
1923;It's definitely worth paying the hefty price of $8.75 too see Sin City in your local theatre.
1924;Directed by Robert Rodriguez, special guest director Quentin Tarantino.
1925;If you're into comics at all you'll love this movie.
1926;I'm not sure how to recommend it to others but you certainly don't need to be a comics fan to enjoy it.
1927;I absolutely loved it without reservation.
1928;The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering.
1929;Boy, did he hit the nail on the head.
1930;Rodriguez has all the respect I can give to him because he is a conservative filmmaker who churns out epic products.
1931;Sin City was shot all digital and it aided Rodriguez in accurately capturing Miller's vision.
1932;The interesting part is that this one true love was a hooker that he spent the night with for the first time.
1933;Marv is played to perfection by Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood is absolutely menacing as the cannibalistic killer.
1934;"Finally comes my favorite plot, ""That Yellow Bastard""."
1935;Rodriguez uses light to highlight faces and shadows that make an incredible effect.
1936;wise but rather their personal thoughts to the action that is happening.
1937;"That Yellow Bastard was definately the best story of them all because it had emotion to it, ""The Hard Goodbye"" was great too mainly because of the character of Marv, and ""The Big Fat Kill"" had some shining moments too but trailed off the radar a few times."
1938;This is pure entertaining filmmaking at its best, it's all style and one hell of an experience.
1939;aCTING/DIRECTING: Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke shine in full glory.
1940;boiled and cynical, and these two played it to perfection.
1941;As it goes for the artistic vision, well, does it really need explaining?
1942;I mean, brilliant use of shadows and light, using the primary colors only when something needs to be emphasized, and capturing emotion through the setting.
1943;One of my favorite scenes was when Bruce Willis' character was framed and in jail for 8 years, he first says that he is alone.
1944;Rodriguez and Tarantino are best buddies, and really I admire their admiration for classic films and film styles.
1945;"Tarantino's Kill Bill films were tributes to Kurosawa and Leone, while Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" trilogy is a tribute to Leone's ""Man with no name"" trilogy."
1946;He gave up his DGA (Director's Guild of America) membership just so that he could have Frank Miller as a co. director, he really wanted Frank with him at all times so that they could get this one done perfect to Miller's standards.
1947;In his recent films if you pay attention to the credits you'll see Robert Rodriguez's name pop up several times.
1948;He does his own music, his editing, cinematography, writing, and directing.
1949;With Sin City he directed, did the music along with John Debney, and did the visual effects.
1950;He takes the workload to make it good, and he knows how to make it good, so I'm not gonna argue
1951;This movie is not for the faint of heart but it full of superstars and so very good.
1952;okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself?
1953;the plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book.
1954;The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.
1955;because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience.
1956;My group loves this one.
1957;one of the most creative and innovative movies of the year, so far.
1958;Even though the picture is in black and white It's a nicely done picture.
1959;It's extremely smooth and crisp and it becomes beautiful when some color is added to make certain things stick out.
1960;explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing.
1961;It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that.
1962;Let him move on to make something with a modicum of depth!
1963;My friend got tickets from a comic store.
1964;I really wanted the film to be good.
1965;The makeup on that Yellow B*st*rd was worth the price of admission to a true fanboy.
1966;There is one good part: one guy gets shot with an arrow and it's the best part of the movie.
1967;my biggest thing: If you're going to build an all digital city, make it look like its more than one block.
1968;The clean 2d style of the comic books was there in ending panels, and they looked hot.
1969;Sin City is all about high key lighting.
1970;Ok, now the big one.
1971;Instead of just rockin' action, he has an inner dialogue!
1972;and then he tells you why his own shot will be on target, and gives you extra info about that even, and then he finally friggin' shoots the guy.
1973;"I was like, ""Shoot him, Yellow B*st*rd!"
1974;Ack!My friend liked it, so this is just one person's opinion.
1975;Watch it on a small TV.
1976;Rodriguez is a genius marketer.
1977;They will be horribly dated and laughed at in the future.
1978;I enjoyed this movie greatly even though I have never read the comic.
1979;I realize that many reviewers didn't like the way that it was shot but I found it to be fresh and bold.
1980;Yeah, I don't want to see many other movies shot this way but it was perfect for this film.
1981;Not so in the case of Sin City which expressed its screen violence filtered through wonderful comic book images which were both realistic and surrealistic at the same time.
1982;Very entertaining and interesting and I rate it at five stars.
1983;This movie has a moral center, and for that I love it.
1984;It's definitely a man's film (and graphic novel), and at the center of each story is a man who will give his life to protect a woman.
1985;the movie is great by itself, but there are a ton of extras that are really interesting .
1986;costume design, interviews with frank miller and more are really great extras!
1987;A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless.
1988;pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.
1989;"Watching ""Sin City"" is kind of like dating a particularly bubble."
1990;sure she's great to look and the sex may even be fantastic.
1991;But sooner or later she's got to do other things besides look great in clothes(or out of them) like, y'know, talk to you.
1992;Upon its theatrical release the film was lauded for it's visually stunning look and on that score at least you can believe the hype.
1993;"on looks alone, no film since the ""The Matrix"" has carried with it since an incredible ""Wow"" factor."
1994;"But ""The Matrix"" also had an engaging, thought."
1995;provoking storyline and well developed characters to move that story forward.
1996;any one of these stories alone would have made for a solid, gripping film.
1997;"robert Rodriguez(""Desperado"" ""Spy Kids"") is reportedly such a huge fan of Frank Miller's work that he offered him a co. directing gig on the movie."
1998;In fact, its astounding that the notoriously sequel.
1999;What makes those movies classics is that they didn't just have style.
2000;I liked the video photography stile.
2001;Story line a little hard to follow but once you get it the story really come together.
2002;This is a pretty good version of the SIN CITY comic books.
2003;At least they did a pretty decent job of keeping to the basics of the original.
2004;I ended up loving it.
2005;the dialogue is fun and dark at the same time.
2006;The visuals are interesting, disturbing and actually contribute to the feel of the movie.
2007;I will watch this several more times and, hopefully, enjoy it as much as I did today!!
2008;"The two most powerful stories are adaptations from ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye."""
2009;Bruce Willis is great, but his voice over narration is a technical mis.
2010;The pitcure is so powerful, the voice over overly impacts the visuals.
2011;Willis is believable as Hartigan and he is the last good cop in a corrupt city .
2012;Alba is perfect as Nancy, the little girl who becomes a stripper (the only role I have appreciated Alba as an actress).
2013;The little girl who plays the young Nancy is splendid.
2014;Good finally previals, but with a price.
2015;"mickey Rourke gives the best performance since ""Angel Heart."""
2016;He is perfect for the part and plays it well.
2017;This time, the voice over narration adds to the visuals and technically works .
2018;enhancing the story and its visuals.
2019;They also show extreme evil, as a man of the cloth perverts what is good for the pleasure of evil transcendence.
2020;The supporting characyters are great, and Rodriguez provides moments to lighten things aup a bit .
2021;And in a world of evil, glimpes of love and hope do survive.
2022;The one good cop and little girl who keeps her promise.
2023;A monster showed attention by a beautiful women, and after avenging her, is shown love by the sister.
2024;Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.
2025;This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.
2026;Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.
2027;Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.
2028;This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.
2029;there are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.
2030;robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.
2031;The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty.
2032;This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.
2033;This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.
2034;Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values.
2035;I've read the comics and the movie is those pictures come alive and moving.
2036;Good performances from all the actors, and Britany Murphy (she suprised me).
2037;Comic book come to life, very over the top.
2038;Loved the black, white, grey and red atmosphere color.
2039;Very dramatic and lots of violence but it goes well with the storyline.
2040;It's nice to know someone has some imagination left.
2041;The three stories were intertwined wonderfully and my attention did not stray once.
2042;"The casting was near perfect, especially a ""creepy"" Elijah Wood."
2043;"sin City is its own entity and will easily become a ""classic"" for new generations to enjoy in years to come."
2044;I have never seen a movie like this one, comic noir.
2045;This is my first, and I thought it was great.
2046;I have never heard of him, but I loved how this movie is made.
2047;"It is definitly for the comic lovers
2048;Loved the comic book style.
2049;Dark and sinister but enjoyable and sometimes funny.
2050;Sin City is brilliant and beautiful looking!
2051;The directing by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino is brilliant.
2052;The visuals are astounding and brilliant.
2053;The music by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell, is impressive.
2054;This is one of the best pictures of the year!
2055;The cast, the filming, the dialogue.
2056;This is the first time that a director has accepted the brilliance of a comic (graphic novel) at face value and attempted to bring it to a larger audience by adapting it for the big screen.
2057;Hopefully the success of this film will be a cue to movie makers everywhere that making comic book adoptions goes way beyond using licensed character names and state of the art CGI.
2058;Sin City the film is brilliant because Sin City the graphic novel series is brilliant (Not to take anything away from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino's direction).
2059;The movie does an excellent job capturing the characters, setting, plot and overall mood and style of the novels.
2060;I knew from the preview that """"Sin City"""" was worth looking into, as I am a huge fan of noir."""
2061;Heck, parts of it suggested that it might be an animated feature.
2062;"It IS a Rodriguez film along with several ""guest directors"" including Quentin Tarantino."
2063;The atmosphere is wonderful, and I am a harsh judge when it comes to neo.
2064;The use of color is spare, expressive and stylish.
2065;The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black.
2066;white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color.
2067;made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white .
2068;the movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word.
2069;It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is.
2070;the casting is outstanding, the women exotically beautiful, unlike the typical barbie dolls who are usually cast into rolls of this type.
2071;this movie is a winning example of retro mingling with modern and doing it very successfully.
2072;I myself may never watch it again, although it is a most brilliant piece of work.
2073;I'd dub it a cult classic upon release.
2074;All I can say is, Wow.
2075;All the little things really do make a difference, in the feel and look of the film.
2076;The acting is great, let me tell you you'll never look at Elijah Wood the same way.
2077;Bring back movies with dialog and story please
2078;"top and unrealistic, but it makes sense when one considers that this is a ""translation"" of Frank Miller's graphic novels."
2079;The cast is simply excellent: Mickey Rourke brings the thuggish Marv to brutal, excessively.
2080;Most of the women are strong.
2081;willed and powerful, like Gail, Wendy, and Miho.
2082;It was shot beautifully, the sets are really cool and comic book.
2083;if you feel like watching people get mutilated for 2 hours, have a good time.
2084;Storytelling at its best .
2085;I guess it takes a graphic novelist like Frank Miller and a true movie visionary like Roberto Rodriguez to pull off the most intense and entertaining film noir of the 21st century thus far.
2086;Kudos to both, and may the collaboration continue!
2087;comic book noir at its most pulp fictiony best.4 interwoven stories that takes place in a city on the outskirts of hell,baSIN city.
2088;here,laws are up for the bidding and its best if you brought a lot of money.
2089;"he gets it in the form of goldie
2090;the last tale is about an excon with a new face and a couple of women he cant get out of his sytem.
2091;rosario dawson is the other woman.
2092;Sin City is one of the most unique movies I've seen in that way it looks.
2093;The city looks dirty and slimy which is perfect for this film.
2094;There is a ton of violence and grit, so it is definitely not for everybody, but it is a perfect depiction of a crime infested city.
2095;It's my favorite Bruce Willis role ever.
2096;Sin City is probably the single best movie I have seen in the last ten years.
2097;I was totally blown away by what they we able to accomplish"
2098;disc Collector's Edition), the deluxe package that ships with The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.
2099;Worth it, but ehhhhhh, as a fan of the blu.
2100;Frank Miller's Sin City is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel.
2101;Still, this is a world where protecting women is hard.
2102;"This movie is rated R for ""sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue,"" but that is most assuredly an R that is a whole lot closer to NC.17 than it is to PG.13."
2103;disc set goes the extra mile.
2104;That is clear as soon as you open up the box and discover it includes a mini.
2105;"This is a good choice not only because it is the first ""Sin City"" graphic novel, but also because it is about Marv and as Marv Mickey Rourke steals this movie from Bruce Willis and the rest."
2106;The two directors having a conversation while screening the film is the best of the extras on this disc, simply because I like the stories of the production a bit more than the details on how the film was made, but both are excellent commentary tracks.
2107;"With the movie broken up this way it is even easier for you to watch a ""chapter"" with Miller's graphic novel in front of you to see the extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film."
2108;"There is also a performance by Bruce Willis with a band at the ""'Sin City' Live"" cast and crew party at Antones filmed by Rodriguez with the digital camera."
2109;For cinema buffs the two treats are the movie in high.
2110;minute uninterrupted take from Tarantino's segment (Dwight and Jackie Boy in the car on the way to the tar pits) that allows a great look at how actors and directors work when shooting digitally.
2111;star movie that not only sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century but also advances the cause of digital filmmaker.
2112;"That it brings Miller's characters and story to life while remaining faithful to his artistic style is a bonus for those whose introduction to ""Sin City"" was the graphic novels, but that was what Miller and wanted and what Rodriguez delivered with his little test run."
2113;Take your graphic novel and noire films to the next level!
2114;This is a superior Blu.
2115;A masterpiece of cinematic art!
2116;Just one more thing it's never a good thing when women betray women, After you see the movie's ending you'll understand what I mean.
2117;Robert Rodriguez really brings Miller's frantic and colorful (although not necessarily in the film, no pun intended) world to life, and makes the lines between comic and movie blur.
2118;Add in some outrageous (and sometimes gruesome) special effects, and a guest directing spot by the heralded Quentin Tarantino, and you have the formula for one of the best and most original movies to hit the silver screen in years.
2119;Short of nothing, this is a must see for fan's of Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino, and the Sin City series.
2120;the story may be somewhat confusing to some as it does jump around a bit (thanks to guest man Tarantino's patented directing style), but most should be able to piece everything together because it all relates to one giant overview in the end.
2121;The cast is perfect for the movie.
2122;The characters are developed wonderfully, and each has their own agenda/means for being in the film (like many I will never look at Elijah Wood the same way again).
2123;The story flows well actually for jumping around a bit, but that is what gives the film its special feel, and one that makes the viewer know this is a worthwhile experience.
2124;The way that the story fits together works almost perfectly considering that going from one frame to the other is not exactly the easiest thing to do.
2125;As for the unrealistic qualities the movie has, like I said it comes from a comic book series.
2126;I'm guessing a lot of people who have complained this movie either don't know this, or haven't read comics/graphics novels.
2127;mindedness, but an unwillingness to accept that there are other ways to create authentic ideas.
2128;Sin City was and still is easily one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences to come along in quite some time.
2129;If you are a fan of the Sin City series, or any other movies which Rodriguez and Tarantino have been involved in, you are in for a spectacular treat, because this is definitely among the best films that either has been a part of.
2130;If you have no idea about any of what I have said or you haven't seen or even heard about anything related to the two directors, this is still a worthwhile movie to see, if only for it's uniqueness.
2131;There's plenty of interesting plot developments, likeable/ hate.
2132;worthy characters, and stunning effects to hold almost any viewer over.
2133;"I've surprised several people by telling them that I believe ""Sin City"" is one of the best movies of the year."
2134;but this movie is indeed great.
2135;It is obviously visually innovative and pleasing, taking film noir to the next level.
2136;"Because, underneath all the flash, ""Sin City"" is actually (and don't laugh!)"
2137;a sophisticated examination of the nature of morality.
2138;most notably the church and the police.
2139;"in other words, Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan are most certainly ""good"" characters in the eyes of the audience."
2140;"But ""Sin City"" is world of extraordinary situations, and these men are able to fight against those situations in the defense of an ideal."
2141;namely, the safety and redemption of a worthy woman.
2142;"In this light, ""Sin City"" caused me to reflect on my own potential actions in certain situations."
2143;Sin City does a remarkably good job of presenting three men who are each pushed far beyond their limits, and the filmmakers leave it for the audience to decide whether these men are moral defenders or just as immoral as the people they come up against.
2144;in light of this, I highly recommend this film, both to those who are looking for an entertaining movie and to those who are in search of a thought.
2145;"That ""Sin City"" can appeal to both types of people demonstrates just how great this film is."
2146;This is s perfect, and I mean absolutely perfect translation of the Frank Miller books of Sin City, a bunch of them, into movement.
2147;Miller creates his graphic novel stuff in stark black and white with splashes of red.
2148;for blood, lipstick, passion (in the form of a red dress), and the thrill of action.
2149;Red bursts through here in the film too, right from the get go.
2150;Becky wears a bright red dress, has bright red lips.
2151;to look happy ever again.
2152;They move from one frame to another, giving life to these emotions in a way that you just can't do on the printed page, even if it's illustrated.
2153;We treat each other badly and that's true even if we have a badge or a title that says we're not supposed to.
2154;But the way this film does it makes it totally fresh and unique.
2155;This is an original piece of work like nothing else out there.
2156;Let's see what Sin City 2 does, due out later this year.
2157;This with out a chance one of the best of the year.
2158;Also you will find yourself laughing more than you thought you would, trust me.
2159;For anyone seeking realistic sets, characters, or action.
2160;this film is NOT for you .
2161;but it sure is cool.
2162;and found it to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while.
2163;"book worlds translate adequately to film (Joel Shumaker does ""Batman,"" for example ."
2164;It takes the illustrator's vision head.
2165;on and makes it a moving picture, which is a new and fantastic idea, but maybe that's the real difference between a comic book and a graphic novel (well, that and 15 bucks).
2166;alright, the acting is stylized.
2167;"Nick Stahl, um, looked better in ""Terminator 3,"" but in ""Sin City"" gives one of the most sickeningly twisted performances I'm sure he'll ever do."
2168;I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, but he's good.
2169;Mickey Rourke is incredible as Marv .
2170;Sin City is definitely a great movie that brings comic book.
2171;It was very satisfying to see the extended scenes, but they should've let you choose between viewing the theatrical cut .
2172;The special features were great to experience though, as you got to see more behind.
2173;scenes featurettes, along with Robert Rodriguez and his crew.
2174;The interactive menu's were cool and creative as well.
2175;The film is all about style.
2176;It is a comic book brought to life.
2177;the film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.
2178;The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.
2179;It certainly is a departure from the norm.
2180;I need a good story.
2181;Not much on words, just a short review, Great movie, trillride from start to end, recommend to all action movie fan's
2182;It came with comic book in new condition.
2183;Rourke gives a stunning performance.
2184;I liked the books by the way.
2185;mickey Rourke was incredible and almost unrecognizeable, but I thought Elijah Wood did a great and creepy job as well.
2186;my favorite Rodriguez movie ever.
2187;so far as film making goes.
2188;the stories meld well together, although for me, there was too much Mickey Rourke and not enough Bruce Willis.
2189;Jessica Alba was gorgeous in black and white, as was Rosaria Dawson.
2190;"Sexy!Yummy violence, I liked the story telling, and I liked The imagery of it all, especially ""that yellow bastard""."
2191;a really refreshing, really good film.
2192;Action packed, dark and sexy theme.
2193;I've added this one to my home movie library.
2194;Happy endings are not always happy, and seeing with clarity does not always mean a pretty picture.
2195;If you are in to gothic noir, Sin City is the movie to see.
2196;L. Clem you obviously cant see art when its smashed into your face.
2197;This movie is by far one of the greatest ever made and i think you are absolutely disgusting for hating it.
2198;I belive that this is one of those must see movies even though its R rated.
2199;There has never been a movie adaptation this close to a comic book before, and that's a good thing.
2200;i saw the movie first, then bought the graphic novels, and now I'm in love with Sin City.
2201;I was pleasantly surprised on how well this was remastered.
2202;perfect a five star rating from me.
2203;top gore, but humorously done.
2204;After I saw movie I read some of the g. novels: very true to the original works.
2205;But I really enjoyed this movie.
2206;the visuals, the dialogue, and the non.
2207;I found the movie to be both artistic and entertaining
2208;Cinematically gorgeous in a way that a 200 million dollar Lucas epic could never imagine.
2209;Overall, a five star film that through all of the excess manages to evoke real human feeling.
2210;Granted, it wont cross generational lines for obvious reasons, however, for the college kids of America, this is high art.
2211;Kudos Rodriguez, I forgive you for the Spy Kids trilogy.
2212;It made the best holiday gift set for my best friend.
2213;The Director does a fine adaptation and makes the movie look like a real comic page turner.
2214;This is a must for all those gory lovers.
2215;This film is made for the formule of successful films which is.
2216;and enjoy the pleasure of Sin.
2217;I thought the sections with Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke were much better and more fun to watch.
2218;It truly is a wild ride!
2219;The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit.
2220;you will be amazed, I promise.
2221;as for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller.
2222;Frank Miller's popular underground graphic novel is one of the most intense, dark, and dastardly comic books I've ever seen.
2223;When I first read the comic about 9 years ago, I thought they'd make a great series of film noir tales.
2224;It 's beautiful package color.
2225;It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too.
2226;Sin City is a highly artistic rendition of a somewhat popular comic book series.
2227;I have never read the comic books, but I really enjoyed the movie.
2228;The use of black and white with splashes of color to focus the viewer is very powerful.
2229;They are stylized, comic book creations done in flesh.
2230;This is a great movie.
2231;Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba were great in this flick, also
2232;A psychogram of today's society.
2233;Besides that a brilliantly filmed movie with convincing actors in a weird story.
2234;It is a comic strip movie with real actors behaving like their sketched alter.
2235;I'd recommend it only for a very mature audience but I know that kids will watch it first.
2236;One of the best independent films of all times!!!
2237;One of my favorite movies ever!!!
2238;robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.
2239;This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.
2240;Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.
2241;Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.
2242;i prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.
2243;The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.
2244;In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.
2245;The style of the film is essentially the bones of the film.
2246;The acting was interesting, and basically terrible.
2247;i know someone who reads graphic novels and he loved this film.
2248;It seemed that the unique visual aspect of the movie overpowered the plot/storyline.
2249;The story line(s) can get a bit blurry at times and you are then flashed with a grand visual display.
2250;"It was made to truly be a ""graphic"" novel for the big screen."
2251;What stands out in my mind is how visually powerful the film was.
2252;"paced, fun and at times racy (my husband truly enjoyed Jessica Alba's ""acting""), this film is for you."
2253;I did see V for Vendetta last week (this film was also based on a graphic novel) which visually could not compare to Sin City, but had a more of a true story line, was suspenseful, bold and even somewhat political and moral.
2254;Of the 2 movies I can say I enjoyed V more overall, but was glad I saw Sin City for its visual appeal.
2255;I really thought this movie was going to be the best for the year.
2256;"It had such a big name cast and the special effects looked so cool
2257;firstly, the special effects are great.
2258;jessica alba looks great in it though!
2259;Yeah, I know there are sexy women and lots of nudity, but for these types of films a story would be nice.
2260;Also, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have done much better in the past.
2261;i used to really respect Rodriguez as a director, but ever since he got caught up in the 3.
2262;This was a very strange but very good movie to me, I honestly am not sure if its a good movie by classical standards but I sure enjoyed watching it.
2263;a really great popcorn movie!
2264;Although the photographic style shows originality, some of the violent scenes were fun, and the actors did a good job, the story is boring.
2265;This movie is completely overlooked.
2266;It is an incredible achievement and well worth the time required to watch it.
2267;Simply awfulSin City is one of the best comic book adaptations to come along in a while.
2268;It's also one of the most visually stunning films ever!
2269;The casting is pitch perfect, the entire cast does a great job.
2270;A must see for Frank Miller Fans, comic book fans, Robert Rodriguez fans, or people who just love good movies.
2271;being a fan of Frank Miller's for over 15 years (i'm 24) and a huge fan of Sin City for about 8 years I was totally pleased with this movie.
2272;I have never seen a movie based off a comic done better.
2273;Sin City is an awesome addition to anyone's collection.
2274;The acting is great and the story is fun and creative.
2275;Film Noir at its best and in the traditional Black and White.
2276;It helps to be familiar with Frank Miller's wonderful graphic novels (Sin City, batman returns,etc) to appreciate the incredible effect this movie has, but regardless this cinema delivers in full an amazing experience.
2277;Acting and casting was superb.
2278;You can't have a dark story about corruption, prostitution, murder, revenge, and redemption without some graphic scenes, but they are still treated with incredible skill.
2279;My advice is to read the books first, then marvel at the interpretation to the screen, but regardless, it's the best movie I've seen in many years.
2280;This new edition (from what I've read, mostly from a Frank Miller interview) has more special features and breaks the stories into stand alone vignettes.
2281;Loved the movie when I saw it in theaters years ago.
2282;Love that I can watch the story all intertwined, or split up into the separate stories.
2283;This movie is one for the ages.
2284;The Directing is """"creative"""" and """"magnificent"""""
2285;One in a class of its own!!!
2286;Sin City is in a class of its own .
2287;What's even better is the additional footage and Behind.
2288;They even included a whole other cut of the movie with the stories placed in the order of the comics plus additional scenes that were cut for timing.
2289;I suspend ethical judgment and take it as it is: a dark fantasy full of sadomasochist imagery, with all the id monsters running free.
2290;There are perfect details: the glasses of the psycho Kevin always shining, the white blood, the silhouettes all black or white, the nude and gorgeous girls, the unbelievable gore, the amazing prowess of Marv and Hartigan, the one.
2291;Nevertheless deep inside them there is a spark of goodness and nobility that make some distinction possible.
2292;"the whole cast seems to enjoy their own performances giving a ""plus"" hardly seen lately."
2293;Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen are top.
2294;jessica Alba is very sensual as the teen.
2295;i give this product big thumb up!
2296;When Sin City came out to the theaters I really wanted to see it but I waited, even though friends told me it was good.
2297;and it was very engrossing.
2298;"The black and white added to the ""old school"" feel and overall it was wonderfully made."
2299;I remember when a friend of mine told me about a movie (I'm not going to say the name) in which one of the characters is a hitman and killed people with a smile in his face and adding a sarcastic and cynic remark and he didn't stand it because of that , he said, human life is a precious gift.
2300;And this movie is an example of that.
2301;First of all, I give the film 5 stars, that said, the blu.
2302;Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films.
2303;Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature.
2304;Still, it's a visual feast, an excellent film.
2305;Its a weird show but also really good, very entertaining.
2306;And it has an awesome cast mickey, clive, Bruce, devon, and of course Jessica Alba.
2307;I think this movie is great to watch and really is unique.
2308;I enjoyed this movie and all its effects.
2309;I thought the movie was terrific on the big screen.
2310;Visually, unlike anything I've seen at the movies.
2311;LOVED it cant sand people that give it a 4 it needs a 10!
2312;its now one of my favorite movies, its true what people are saying it is the next Pulp Fiction.
2313;finding iut its the senators son he is sent to jail and charged for all of his sons crimes.
2314;i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.
2315;I really liked the movie.
2316;My husband did not care for it, but it enteratined me and enjoyed the twists and the changing stories.
2317;"let's get creative without the use of ""Hos"" and extreme graphic ""violence."""
2318;Parts of this film were brilliant, other parts rancid.
2319;It's got one of the sharpest looks I've seen in a film in some time.
2320;"Miller did the comic, and his codirection credit was a nod to his originality, because the credits say Rodriguez ""shot and cut"" the film (i. e., he directed it)."
2321;Of the three, I liked Owen the best: he had the spaced out look of a comic character, and registered not a single thought behind his eyes.
2322;But I loved this movie anyway.
2323;It was gritty and in.your.
2324;It kept you on your feet from intro to credits.
2325;So take an awesome storyline, add a power cast of heavy hitter actors and you've got an equation for one kickass movie!!!
2326;I wanted to like this film, i really did.
2327;It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format.
2328;In essence you get a moving graphic novel.
2329;It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace.
2330;I am a big fan of Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book series, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, pretty much all of the actors in the film, and the film itself.
2331;I loved this movie, it was like a dream come true for me, being such a huge fan of the comic and the author to see him come together with my favorite director, Robert Rodriguez.
2332;Its just a great movie, i'll leave it at that.
2333;There are three incredibly cool and creative people involved with making this movie, plus this movie is shot and put together in such a cool way, its a disservice NOT to have special features about the making of this movie.
2334;but back to the movie, the chapters with Mickey O'Rourke and Bruce Willis are great.
2335;an interesting study in how to make a movie look and feel like a comic book come to life, but some emotional depth and resonance would have given these chapters some depth, and make us care for what happens to the characters.
2336;Sure, your friends might think you hip and cool for going along with the crowd and singing the praises of Sin City, but honesty will make you more original and an independent thinker, free of the simplistic views of most of your peers.Yes, the simplistic kind of thinking (or non.
2337;The director took a little bit of Pulp Fiction and combined it with some of the gore of Kill Bill to come up with this highly entertaining film.
2338;It is like a dark comic book come to life, shot in black in white, with color only used when the director was emphasizing something.
2339;the special effects are wild, the violance graphic and the women are very hot!
2340;The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy).
2341;With out the Alba factor this is a pretty good movie.
2342;I also really like the sound leveling.
2343;Co. directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller (who clearly has a lot more to learn if you've seen his solo debut The Spirit), Sin City looks more and more impressive as flicks like Spirit and Watchmen strive to create the same excitement.
2344;Pricey but worth it for hardcore fans.
2345;Overheated and embarrassing adaptation of the classic hero.
2346;The film is undeniably a visual masterpiece.
2347;I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.
2348;Spectacular, Fun and edgy everything you want from a movie in this genre.
2349;In fact it takes it to a new level.
2350;"I became a fan of Frank Miller's work the day I opened the pages of ""The Dark Knight Returns."""
2351;Miller took the comic world by storm with his writing style.
2352;He's a film noir fan at heart and Sin City is every bit an anachronistic blend of comic book action and pulpy dialogue.
2353;movies combined, all taking place at approximately the same time.
2354;the first and last scenes of the movie perfectly capture the tone of film noir: a beautiful girl and a mysterious dark.
2355;there are too many villains to list here, but they are all memorable even in their few moments of screen time.
2356;"style, and the hired mercenary who moved from bullets to explosives because, ""you just can't go back to shooting people when you've seen a pub blow up and all the parts fly out."
2357;By staying true to the original characters, the director (Robert Rodriguez) creates an entirely new film genre.
2358;a few bandages and pills later and he's fine.
2359;The men are all really nasty lugs and the women are all gorgeous and toned.
2360;the movie is filmed in all black and white, with splashes of color for good measure.
2361;This achieves two amazing effects: it nails the feel of film noir and draws the viewer's eyes to important things about characters that might otherwise be missed.
2362;Sin City is true to itself, and it's up to the audience if they want to go along for the ride.
2363;this is the same kind of uncompromising vision that Peter Jackson brought to the screen with Lord of the Rings.
2364;"This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a ""translation"") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over."
2365;god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good.
2366;Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop.
2367;Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive.
2368;And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work.
2369;There's also a lot of Tarantino.
2370;This is the most true to the source movie ever made.
2371;I'm sure it helped that one of the directors is a big fan of the comics and the other is the creator himself.
2372;I saw this movie at a screening last night and everyone there loved it.
2373;Every one should watch this movie and see what a real comic book movie should be like.
2374;"Sin City is the most stylish movie to hit theaters since ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""."
2375;Stylish and comic book.y, directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller deliver a film that feels live a graphic novel come to life.
2376;"Shot in black and white with some reds and yellows thrown in, ""Sin City"" engages the eyes as well as the mind."
2377;willis, Rourke, and Owen are the stars in this ensemble cast.
2378;Each embodies their characters and drives their respective stories.
2379;From under a large amount of makeup, Marv's story is the emotional core of the movie.
2380;His desire for revenge against the people who took the only good thing in his life away from him is the best of the stories.
2381;Sin City is really an amazing piece of work.
2382;One can't halp but feel that he really gets the source material, and has a passion for it.
2383;"star cast, Quentin Tarintino's guest directing, and attempt to make the movie ""artistic"" and stylish, it was unbelievably horrible."
2384;Everyone's a killer and they all enjoy being killers.
2385;i have never read the comics but i got to say that this is one of the best movies ever!!!!
2386;lots of great action vilonce and some humor i loved this movie so much i have seen it about 6 or 5 times sooooo good i love this movie.
2387;i love it and i hope every one else loved it.
2388;Yes it was violent and gritty, but it was real and wonderful.
2389;I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline.
2390;I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant!
2391;"If you like movies like ""Sixth Sense"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and the ""Others"" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City."
2392;Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation.
2393;He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well.
2394;noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie.
2395;It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands.
2396;noir genre, adds to the entertainment value.
2397;Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling.
2398;lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong.
2399;noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis.
2400;It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen.
2401;In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard.
2402;Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two.
2403;This is a Great Movie, but the director announced months ago that this movie will be a double dip.
2404;Be sure that you wait if you want the extra stuff
2405;Good storyline, great characters, lots of action, and sex appeal.
2406;I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a great movie based on a graphic novel.
2407;It is visual candy to the extreme.
2408;The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it.
2409;There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2.
2410;dimensional characters and visual tedium.
2411;"Like ""Sky Captain"", ""Sin City"" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes."
2412;Sin City is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one.
2413;"on the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life ""Sin City"" does that ."
2414;Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma.
2415;Sin City is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes.
2416;Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game.
2417;The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from one movement to the other, well done Mickey.
2418;"Marv is a badass and was the best part of the film
2419;You pretty much regret that each one has to end.
2420;Les Mis comes to mind, and subsequently makes me throw up .
2421;this is a TRUE masterpiece.
2422;worldly film, which I promise, with its intense imagery and in.your.
2423;face assured direction, will be unlike any movie journey you've ever taken.
2424;Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen all do terrific jobs as embattled heroes living in a nihilistic, sex.
2425;Indeed, the film has many qualities of a good western.
2426;up commando chin and hawk nose, is the greatest send.
2427;fest of the graphic comic novels written by Frank Miller.
2428;is the film about anything other than the director's assured style as he captures the gritty world of a graphic comic novel?
2429;The film does stand for a certain kind of courage and integrity that survives in a world of corruption, lies, and nihilism.
2430;i think though that what stand out in the end is the original style, so assured and consistent throughout.
2431;This is a landmark film and I would bet that it will pave the way for a new age of graphic novels adapted to film.
2432;From the opening scene, this film grabs you by the throat, and takes you on an unforgettable ride.
2433;visually stunning, with no holds barred depictions of the violence that dwells within the souls of the inhabitants of """"Sin City""""."""
2434;The lines between good and evil are very blurred.
2435;"in my opinion, as good as ""Pulp Fiction""."
2436;undoubtably the best film I have seen in a long time.
2437;"This film represents the time and place where entertainment and artistic appreciation allowed themselves to be perfectly balanced in every realm from production design to casting
2438;The script chills while the casting humanizes every character with perfect sense and style.
2439;Every shot allows the viewer to appreciate the time and place of the scene as well as an uncanny amount of beauty within every frame.
2440;See the film with a mind geared toward literature, film, graphic novels, and all mediums noir"
2441;This is a great movie, Rodriguez and Miller make a great team in this production, this set includes one of the Sin City graphic novels and an a disc with deleted scenes on it.
2442;Just try and resist it.
2443;If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.
2444;If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.
2445;Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.
2446;A great rendition of a fantastic series by a comic writer that has created a brutally real universe.
2447;A must see fer sure !
2448;"and so on, after which the actor/actress throws a ""meaningful"" dramatic look at the bleeding victim and pull out their big gun/sword/bazooka."
2449;the women have of course their own bazookas stuck in their leather G. strings and their hair always has wind in it and they are really really badass.
2450;But if you like computer games with women fighters you probably will enjoy this.
2451;While there are 3 stories going on in this interesting looking movie, the one that makes this movie worth watching again and again is the Big Fat Kill!
2452;He meets a beautiful woman (prostitute) who treats him like a decent human despite his horrid looks.
2453;While he's having a good time with her, he wakes up the next day and finds that she's been murdered right next to him.
2454;He keeps remembering that she was the one person who treated him decent and now it was time to pay back the lowlife that took her life.
2455;marv goes to the edge of the gutter and beyond to find the answers.
2456;He makes some funny revelations along the way that will have you laughing your socks off.
2457;The other stories are really intriguing as well as managing to bring all the stories to a nice logical ending.
2458;sin City is definitely following the comic book making sure to try and hold up the comic book look.
2459;It is one of the few unique looking movies that have several well.
2460;toting characters, and an all around unique experience take a look at Sin City.
2461;"This film's over the top violence reminded me of ""Natural Born Killers"", but this film was infinitely better directed and had a much better story line."
2462;I can certainly see how many people can love this film and find it terribly exciting.
2463;This is the kind of film, even more than the name implies, is about the dark side of mankind.
2464;all that aside, the story lines are good and the film is extremely creative and well made.
2465;It was an enjoyable film, but I didn't think it was great.
2466;one of the attractions of the film was the all star cast.
2467;The most overated actor in Hollywood finally hits a Home Run.
2468;Better than expected performance .
2469;He fits his character .
2470;overall, this film is not for everyone, but if you're not too offended by wallowing in violence and discussions of raping and torturing children, you'll probably find you enjoy the film and possibly even love it.
2471;His character, indeed his whole first story, made the film for me.
2472;He is ruthless, bereft of compassion for anyone that gets in his way.
2473;At the same time, he's actually a pretty decent guy.
2474;Despite his cruel nature I liked him a lot.
2475;I can see it in a comic book, reading it, and even liking it.
2476;Scarred but noble men defending tarnished angels.
2477;Somebody gets hit by a car not once, but twice, and just walks away.
2478;This film is not for everyone, but I loved it.
2479;It's another highly stylized ultraviolent movie from that dynamic duo Rodriguez and Tarrantino.
2480;The stories are also quite good, though thematically typical of at least a few of graphic novels I've read.
2481;In a world where perverts can be the next president, corruption goes to the very top, love is bought and sold, and life doesn't seem to be worth very much, What does one cling to?
2482;All in all, once you get past the bullets, blood, and dismemberment, the stories are really kind of sweet.
2483;I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances.
2484;Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv.
2485;Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three.
2486;There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body.
2487;The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect.
2488;Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late).
2489;Sin City is a place I will be visting a couple more times before it leaves the big screen.
2490;I've seen it once and enjoyed it's dark nature.
2491;The animation/live action blend is great and the action is pretty non stop.
2492;My boyfriend loves this movie and has wanted it for a long time now.
2493;It is visually compelling but empty of meaning, interest and emotional impact.
2494;The characters (and the actors themselves) are often quite beautiful (Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy) but not in the least bit engaging.
2495;dimensional as the characters who commit it.
2496;"It resembles a comic book (or, if you prefer, ""graphic novel"") in every way: beautiful, shallow and deceptively hollow."
2497;"Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" was one of the best comic books ever written."
2498;It has these awesome ensemble characters.
2499;Each was so interesting and each had their flaws and all of them seemed human.
2500;robert Rodriguez is one of the greatest directors of our time .
2501;he stands by Tarantino, Spielberg, Craven and others as collaberator of some of the greatest films that we've been pleased enough to see.
2502;"He made amazing movies such as ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", ""Desperadoes"", 2003's beautiful and bloody epic, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"", he also makes kid's films that are actually fun to see."
2503;"He made the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy and he just finished the new 3."
2504;But his true jems are films like this.
2505;Sin City is filmed in a very interesting way.
2506;"It's Black and White, but various objects (eyes, blood, outfits, etc.) are in color, which makes ""Sin City"" a breathtaking pulpy noir film."
2507;"John Hartigan (Bruce Willis in his best work since ""Die Hard"") plays a cop who is retiring at 60 because of heart condition."
2508;This movie is worth watching just for her, she's SO HOT!)
2509;He was framed and he is spending 8 years in prison.
2510;The bloody results are anything but pretty.
2511;"in conclusion, ""Sin City"" is easily the coolest movie of the year and it provides great surprises and thrills the whole way through."
2512;disc special edition that will include new footage and much more.
2513;I bought it for about $10 somewhere, but I will be the first one there when the Special Edition hits the shelves.
2514;I have to say that it was very well put together visually and the many stories were scripted well to make the story cohesive.
2515;I love all the characters even the Eric Stahl character.
2516;It was well scripted and well directed it was true to the title and the graphic novel.
2517;This was good work Robert and Quentin, but that is to be expected with these two directors, bravo.
2518;I hope to see a sequel with some more on the Josh Hartnett character.
2519;Watching this movie on a my 42 inch Panasonic Plasma with the DTS soundtrack is one amazing experience.
2520;The stories in the movie itself are very captivating .
2521;The stylization in the movie is first class and reminiscent of previous Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks.
2522;All of Frank Miller's graphic novel vision is stunningly recreated in the film.
2523;It is providing for one's self a movies both exhilirating and seductive.
2524;Would recommend to anyone who enjoys films of the comic strip genre.
2525;Granted, he did do a guest director job.
2526;Anyways, i'm sure you all know that this film is a visual masterpiece.
2527;so yeah, see it, make others see it.
2528;Check out a sample of the comic book and you will see that it is necessary and very well done.
2529;Two words: Must have!Three words: Recut.
2530;Was very well presented both the outer packaging and the inclusion of the commic.
2531;If you like the film you'll love this version
2532;Sin City has made me more aware of the many entertaining films Frank Miller has written, produced, and or directed.
2533;"It reminds me of taking a ""R"" rated movie such as Roger Rabbit to a ""R""plus more violence rated status of the same genre."
2534;up work by K. n. b. EFX GROUP,INC. is excellent.
2535;I am so impressed by their work I felt compelled to make sure I give credit to the proper group of artist which created this work.
2536;ray Disc available to me at a great price!
2537;If you love this film you have to get this special edition.
2538;robert Rodriguez has put together an massive collection of making of's and commentaries and the stories separated into their own short films.
2539;Of course Rodriguez' and Frank Miller's commentary track is the most revealing, and the long take, is a great insight into filmmaking as you see Quentin Tarantino direct a scene in real time.
2540;They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.
2541;Hence, a comic book movie is born.
2542;probably the first comic book movie.
2543;sure there's Batman and Superman and X. men and Spider.
2544;Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.
2545;Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid.80's) and he has a certain vision.
2546;i think he got that and a helluva lot more.
2547;In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new.
2548;found appreciation of comics in general.
2549;Sin City is one of my favorite movies.
2550;Simply stated this is the best Comic to Movie adaption ever produced yet.
2551;create something that is already an established and popular media and ruins it in the process by changing the things that made it popular in the first place.
2552;Sin City looks and feels like a comic come to life.
2553;now I don't always want a cheery happy ending.
2554;but from time to time it would be nice to see a hero in Miller's world actually survive !
2555;Saw this great film on sale and since I was given a blue ray player for christmas, I just had to add to my collection.
2556;I really enjoyed this movie, I think it is the best one of the year, but it's not what I expected when I walked into the theater.
2557;heroes like in the movie.
2558;Ah well, it is still a fun and thrilling movie.
2559;I saw Sin City twice in theaters and obviously it's a great flick.
2560;Combining the visual appeal, coloring and decadent richness ofThe City of Lost Childrenand the film noir aspects ofDark City (New Line Platinum Series)andTouch of Evil (Restored to Orson Welles' Vision), 'Sin City' is a fantastically novel approach to the adaptation of graphic novels to film.
2561;Director Robert Rodriguez artfully crafts a sublime fantasy world where life is as terrible as it is richly adorned with well.
2562;developed characters portrayed by actors like Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Benicio Deltorro, and so many more.
2563;If you have somehow managed to not see this movie so far, I recommend you change that as soon as you can!
2564;boiled pulp novels he enjoyed as a youth have come to life on the big screen in the respectful hands of Robert Rodriguez.
2565;If you understand the pallet that Miller and Rodriguez used to make this film, then you might just appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.
2566;"frank Miller started out in comics back in the late 70s, first making his landmark with his famous run on Marvel's ""Daredevil"" series in the early 80s where he created one of the most beloved female assassins of all."
2567;moving on, The Dark Knight Returns brought Miller a lot of publicity which led him to Hollywood to write the two Robocop sequels.
2568;So Miller returned to comic book land and decided to draw what he wanted to draw.
2569;Taking his love of Dashiel Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane novels, Miller created Sin City.
2570;There would be tough guys, sexy women and classic cars.
2571;Miller loved it, and agreed to let Rodriguez direct the film but only if he could co. direct it.
2572;rodriguez decided to translate three of Miller's graphic novels to the film to give the world a good idea of what Sin City was.
2573;the movie is the most accurate and loyal adaptation of a comic book ever made.
2574;Filmed on green screens, the backgrounds were all animated giving the film a magical look, almost as if we are not in a real world.
2575;Mickey Rourke gives the best performance of his career.
2576;Bruce Willis is more than perfect for the role of Hartigan, and Elijiah Wood delivers a frightening performance as Kevin the cannibalistic serial killer.
2577;"It's probably one of the coolest films since Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction""."
2578;Lord knows how many times I had to explain to people that the end of the film happens before Travolta is killed by Butch.
2579;Frank Miller is one of the best comic book writers of all time and Sin City is as hard and as tough as they come.
2580;It was worth the 13 year wait!
2581;The most faithful comic to film adaptation of all time, Frank Miller's Sin City is brilliantly realized by maverick director Robert Rodriguez, combining Miller's gritty and pulpy stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) with completely rendered, digital backgrounds.
2582;The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.
2583;Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.
2584;The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.
2585;The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.
2586;Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.
2587;Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking, Sin City is a masterpiece.
2588;You more than likliy know if you are going to enjoy this movie before you even read my review.
2589;"Not everyone will enjoy this film, in fact I would go so far as to say that the movie is more of an ""aquired taste""."
2590;I commend Robert Rodriguez for having the guts to make a movie with such high production values and expensive star power, while knowing this film is far from the main.
2591;you, the reader know what kind of movies you enjoy, and If you are the type who likes the movies that your friends never quite understand, Sin City is a world you must experience.
2592;Remaining faithful to the source material is key.
2593;What makes it even better is getting a director who is a fan.
2594;bent on staying true to the comic that he actually resigned from The Directors' Guild of America just to allow Miller to be credited as Co. director.
2595;the movie boasts an impressive, all.
2596;star ensemble cast which includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Mickey Rourke, Jaime King, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro.
2597;Perhaps the reasoning behind this much star power is that each story is of its own entity.
2598;Sure his portrayal may be stereotypical at times, but he makes it work with ease.
2599;The Hard Goodbye is probably the most enjoyable story.
2600;nails bruiser who sets out to avenge the death of his hooker girlfriend Goldie (King).
2601;top, features some of the most memorable moments of the film.
2602;Keep your eyes open for an intense car scene directed by Rodriguez's good friend, the master of front seat dialogue himself: Quentin Tarantino.
2603;shot and cut entirely by Rodriguez, Sin City is a triumph.
2604;The splashes of color and it's pulpy, film noir style are both abrasive and dazzling.
2605;Combined with Miller's sensationally slick dialogue, the result is a beautiful and timeless classic, which will undoubtedly be shown in future film schools for many years to come.
2606;directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez manage to pull off the finest comic book adaptation to date.
2607;The women are sexy in a way that many may see as sexist, however as a counterbalance they are also as tough as the heroes and hold their own as characters.
2608;sin City's visual magic comes mostly from the subtle use of CGI to create a graphic and believable urban backdrop.
2609;High impact colour set against a monochrome background gives a feeling that you are literally stepping into a comic book.
2610;however what really takes this film to another realm is how true it stays to the level of violence depicted in Miller's novels.
2611;it's an interesting film to bring out in such a time of political ambiguity.
2612;sin City is most definitely fantasy cinema at its best.
2613;A great cast including Benicio DelToro,Bruce Willis,Britney Murphy,Rosario Dawson,Jessica Alba, and many more.
2614;I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks.
2615;Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.
2616;I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time!
2617;These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_ Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_ Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.
2618;"all in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant
2619;bringing the characters to life.
2620;And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless.
2621;I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness.
2622;important in a workable society.
2623;Easily the best film of the year.
2624;Great two disc set with graphic novel.
2625;What this is, is practically a frame.
2626;frame reconstruction of three of the greatest graphic novels ever written.
2627;It is pretty much a companion piece to the original artwork.
2628;The spirit here is classic film noir.
2629;It wins because the innocent are either protected or avenged.
2630;Yeah, maybe these are morality plays, but they are good morality plays.
2631;and he is still my hero now: """"That the best you can do, you Pansies?"""
2632;The primary special feature here is an interview with Miller, the other directors, and the main actors.
2633;"It is well done and their enthusiasm for the project shines through, which is unusual for Hollywood (the original ""Sin City."")"
2634;This is a great movie for those of you that have or have not read the graphic novels by Frank Miller.
2635;I bought it because it came with the graphic novel.
2636;The Bottom Line:This movie is most assuredly not for everyone, but if you appreciate this sort of thing you'll find a perfectly assembled movie that takes tropes from classic noir and fuses them with a modern, comic book sensability into an altogether new and brilliant creation.
2637;I thought the directors and the actors carried the story well, and the photography was excellent.
2638;he hooks up with a girl named goldie.
2639;all in all,i highly recommend this and hope a franchise is in the works.
2640;it's amazing, and mickey rourke back to the hollywood.
2641;Robert Rodriguez make good children movies.
2642;The CGI backgrounds are well used this time (vs. the well.
2643;but some of the shots (for example, when travelling in cars) are so stilized that take from the possible force of situations all the tension: in a fantasy world, the world of videogames and C. movies Rodriguez and Tarantino grew in, you never die even when you do and so there's no danger.
2644;"linear screenplay ala ""Pulp Fiction"" also takes out of the film its share of interest, and so we are left with the esthetics and the gorgeous girls (and maybe that was the intention of the auteur)."
2645;I don't know if the film is going to survive the relentless advancement of technological eye candy (that makes fx made for fx wonderment some years ago look like, ahem, garbage) but the undoubtful interest of Rodriguez in his material and the efforts put in the realization makes this film at least a candidate to top the comic adaptation sub.
2646;book format that is simply a more stylishly presented comic book.
2647;A real Republican, reactionary, fascist.
2648;This movie is gratuitous, occasionally visually arresting (but the style gets old fast), and loaded with disgusting images worthy of those pimple.
2649;echo of classic 40s film.
2650;this version is really worth your buck.
2651;I just did't care for the movie but thanks for offering it, will have to check out some other ones soon.
2652;Every shot could easily be transferred into a frame of a comic book.
2653;It's mostly in black and white but it's beautiful nonetheless.
2654;The use of shadows and light is amazing.
2655;Each of the stories I found interesting but it did take a little while to develop an interest in each one of them.
2656;I think the movie ran a little long but, still, I really enjoyed it.
2657;keeps your gaze fixed to the screen.
2658;I was on the fence but glad I bought it.
2659;Showed up early, and pretty much was in brand new condition.
2660;If you haven't watched the film, it's a good one.
2661;robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller then adapted said comics into a live action motion picture, with a small cameo directing appearance from Quinten Tarantino.
2662;miller's dialogue is crisp and edgy with dark humour counterbalancing the sheer splashes of blood red colour onscreen.
2663;I forgive this however with the knowledge that the movie is maybe the closest adaptation of a comic ever lifting shot for shot and almost word for word from the source.
2664;this movie appeals to the comic collecting young crowd, but also to a crowd of older moviegoers that like innovative directing, searing action, ambigous morals and plenty of action in their movies.
2665;This movie had not only a great movie, but was visual great as well.
2666;If you want to watch a great action film this is it.
2667;Overall it is a great movie, the black and white makes it look very cool and comic book like, while the hint of color in each character brings them to life.
2668;Fantasy films, shot in black and white, with a splash of color for effect, went out of fashion before they ever could be fashionable.
2669;I thought I had seen all of his movies and was surprised to have discovered this movie.
2670;a film that is black and white in it's characters as much as it is literally black and white.
2671;the most misogynistic movie I have ever seen, but it is also unlike anything else I have seen .
2672;"Recomended for guys, expecially movie ""geeks""."
2673;Sin City is one wild ride of a movie.
2674;With it's black and white filming, the unique use of certain colors such as red for blood and lipstick to accent certain people and things, it's rough but sometimes brutally funny dialogue, and it's riveting action sequences, there is nothing that has come before it that I can compare it to.
2675;It is a feast for the eye and you won't want to turn away for fear of missing a moment.
2676;So amazingly original and fresh.
2677;Rodriguez proves he is among the most talented directors working.
2678;mickey Rourke is the standout.
2679;He really deserves an Oscar nomination(and the Oscar) for his role as Marv.
2680;In all that makeup he manages to make this character so REAL.
2681;bruce Willis also exceeds expectations.
2682;You have to really see the humor in Brittany Murphy's performance.
2683;Her role is purposely over the top and high camp, excellent job.
2684;Rosario Dawson is right on the money as the diva with some serious weaponry.
2685;taking visual movies i have ever seen.
2686;either way the movie is a triumph and visually will catch you by suprised.
2687;i will definatley recommend this movie to any movie watcher.5 stars out of 5
2688;"I can only hope that the ""Dark Knight Returns"" is made into a movie."
2689;"I'd love to see a ""directed by Frank Miller"" on that one!"
2690;After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.
2691;This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.
2692;The star cast of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Anna Paquin, Clive Owen, and many more make it worth all the while.You also get this cool additional comic book, which is where it all started, isn't it?
2693;"Frank Miller also revamped Batman in the 80's with the Year One plot that became a basis for the excellent ""Batman Begins"" film."
2694;"He also directed the highly underrated ""Spirit"" from his own idol that starred Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johanson."
2695;"He also did the original comic of ""300"" and the prequel ""Xerxes"" (the latter which has been adapted into a sequel)."
2696;This one is vastly superior, about 40 percent better in my opinion.
2697;With Robert Rodriguez, you always know the disc is going to be stuffed to the gills with extra content.
2698;ray image at it's very finest.
2699;TINY price for a whole lotta awesome.
2700;the women are stunning (in more ways then one), the men are almost as ruthless and unforgiving as they are.
2701;This is a great movie and an excellent transfer.
2702;Unskippable previews makes this a 1 star.
2703;I thought for a violent but comic book feel kinda movie it was really good.
2704;if you were looking for a flick to pick up with a lot of good actors I would recommend this.
2705;Better yet why couldnt they release just one, full, definitive version like the star wars trilogy?
2706;Just be patient guys and resist the temptation!
2707;The storylines that weave in and out of each other are fantastic although the dialogue is wooden at times (although I think that this is intentional.)
2708;Overall, one of the most unique movies to come out in decades.
2709;pena come in a thin line, indeed recommend.
2710;If you love graphic novels, chances are very good that you will love this movie.
2711;It is done remarkably well and the black.
2712;The movie is very intense, disturbing with lots of slice and dice blood and gore.
2713;It still is a very entertaining movie.
2714;The unique style of filming which blends comic book style visuals with very dark overtone, makes the movie an excellent choice for the comic book enthusiast.
2715;The story line is good .
2716;The characters are excellent and very well developed and at the end of the movie you feel like you just read a 200 pages intense comic book with some richly designed visuals.
2717;Although the script(s) here are shallow, melodramatic and outrageously exaggerated (specifically in violence) this film is well worth viewing beyond its surprising entertainment value.
2718;The work here is startling and highly original.
2719;Great mini which sets up the feel of the city and hence, the feel of the movie.
2720;then, we get right to the good stuff: MARV.
2721;the Marv segment steals the show for me, hands down.
2722;hero stories, I love intense violence and gore, I love insane cannibal stories and I love Mickey Rourke (good to see him in a bigger role again).
2723;Better yet, who ever thought there would be a flick where Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood brawl!?!
2724;Marv is a superb anti.
2725;Benico shined bright as always.
2726;bruce Willis returns in a wonderful grand finale.
2727;What a sickeningly good show he put on.
2728;the stylish noir of the film is genius, the stark with the touches of burning color.
2729;this film gets stars all across the board from me.
2730;all is stunningly good and Miller's brillance was wonderfuly transported from the page to the screen.
2731;the real stroke of genius here was letting Frank Miller co. direct the movie.
2732;Rodriguez (and Tarantino, somewhere) aided with the techincal and camera direction aspect but Miller repainted the mood of his graphic novels.
2733;This is why it came out so good, unlike the bastardized versions of comics which hit theaters without consultationof the original creators (doody.
2734;Rami did great on the SPIDER.
2735;Miller was one of the best things to ever happen to Batman.
2736;I highly, highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys crime, noir, horror and overall fun movies.
2737;First, let me start off by saying that I'm a huge comic book fan.
2738;I'm even a big fan of some of Frank Miller's work and recognize that Batman: Year One is one of the best Batman stories ever written.
2739;That said, I hadn't read any of his Sin City stories and I definitely won't be reading them now.
2740;the thing that bothers me the most about the steaming pile of crap called Sin City is that it is being held up as an example of what comic books are truly about, with numerous reviewers touting it as the first authentic translation of a comic book.
2741;If you want a true example of a good adaptation of a good independent comic, go see American Splendor or Ghost World.
2742;And if you want a good example of the best that the action adventure genre of comics has to offer, go see Batman Begins instead.
2743;Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy.
2744;I did give it atleast two stars for the unusual filming techniques and special effects.
2745;It was still fun to look at, though.
2746;If nothing else, it will be cool to look at.
2747;Happy it's here, but mad they double dipped!
2748;It has 3X story, and the blood looks so cool.
2749;Jackie Boy is the best character, and he's so funny!
2750;"Robbie Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarrantino have created another ""Pulp Fiction"", and broke the mold with some actors."
2751;for how is one to take a loving sweet hobbit, who is.
2752;The visual techniques are very impressive and make Sin City a film icon unto itself.
2753;The first and most important element of any decent Sci.
2754;fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters.
2755;are all possible to achieve with visuals .
2756;Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self.
2757;top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.
2758;The film is gritty, dark, violent, and recreates the comic books its based on perfectly.
2759;I've read the other reviews, and I somewhat agree with most.
2760;"I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality
2761;I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing"
2762;The acting is excellent throughout.
2763;"This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike ""Pulp Fiction"", but a little more clever and even poetic."
2764;I thought the script was wonderful.
2765;"This is indeed a sort of ""parallel universe"" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained."
2766;rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent.
2767;Watching this was so much fun!
2768;this is easily the best use of SFX and CGI in quite some time.
2769;the Noir style of the film, with all those jagged jaws, tough women and blood splattered corpses, makes this film the most visually arresting of the last few years.
2770;It really has pushed the envelope in what can now be done to illustrate a story and create a credible world for the characters to inhabit it.
2771;Absolutely magnificent imagination at work here and all the artists should be commended for giving us such a vivid creation.
2772;This is easily the best comic.
2773;book adaptation ever committed to celluloid.
2774;and what a gargantuan task it must have been for Frank Miller to adapt most of his novels into one cohesive story!
2775;He makes the art of script.
2776;Anyone who saw the recent film THE JACKET knows what I'm talking about here.
2777;the performances are very convincing and no one actor overshadows the others.
2778;This ensemble piece is spellbinding and, once again, is there to showcase the diverse stories rather than glorifying individual characters.
2779;the music and soundstage is also carefully tailored to bring out the best details and deliver realistic sounds of a city losing it's soul.
2780;Robert Rodriguez delivers a pulpy music track that blends smoky Jazz, salty Brass and the thumping electricity of glass being cracked with bare feet.
2781;tarantino, Miller and Rodriguez have given film connoisseurs a movie that will tickle their taste.
2782;sIN CITY is a landmark film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, it oozes class and style and will give you old fashioned entertainment.
2783;Stinky juveniles should stay well away and allow adults to savour this Pulp.
2784;okay, I'll shut up for now.
2785;A good product with a lower price.
2786;There are no words to describe how happy I was, after seeing this film.
2787;There's tons of wonderful violence and super hot babes.
2788;This is just what the movie industry needed.
2789;There will be a special edition out before christmas for this awesome movie!
2790;I really enjoyed this Movie.
2791;The film is comprised of three main stories.
2792;There's a large, talented, well.
2793;the movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core.
2794;book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling.
2795;all in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie.
2796;I just hope I can write something half as compelling as Sin City.
2797;It's a gritty, film noir comic movie and one good piece of work.
2798;I like anything with Bruce Willis in it and he's good in this piece, as expected.
2799;it's great to see an overrated actor like Willis (who I like by the way) get totally blown out of the water by Mickey Rourke.
2800;I was fooled in to thinking that this was a great movie.
2801;"heart for beautiful women
2802;this is truly a comic book come to life.
2803;Sin City is simply the heroic tales of three super.
2804;First and foremost, SIN CITY is a treat for the eyes.
2805;It attempts a lot technically, and ACHIEVES it.
2806;There are a few moments in the movie (the shot of Bruce Willis leaving prison, with snow coming down on him, for example) that are beautiful, pure and simple.
2807;The movie is worth a look just for the technical aspects.
2808;But I am a fan of film noir, and what I loved about this movie was the way it melded """"old style"""" film noir narration (a la the books of Dashiel Hammett or Raymond Chandler) with a modern sensibility."""
2809;Some of them have hearts of gold, or at least, hearts that aren't totally black, and these are our heroes.
2810;I felt it most cleanly walked the line between humor, pathos and suspense.
2811;His character was an original.
2812;nearly everyone in the movie was terrific.
2813;Clive Owen (whom I've always found a bit hard to warm up to) was very good.
2814;he's darn good in them.
2815;Jessica Alba is the most important female character, and while she looks the part, her acting talents aren't totally up to snuff.
2816;she fares best among the women.
2817;"But the women are also strong and can ""take care of themselves."""
2818;A great overall visual look (Visual Effects supervisor: Robert Rodriquez), great editing (Rodriquez) and camera work (Rodriquez).
2819;Good musical score (co. composed by Rodriquez) and great sound work.
2820;There's always something fun to listen to or to see.
2821;I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am ready to see it again!
2822;I bought it because I like Bruce Willis.
2823;Seeing the movie was only half over I clicked further up the bar and came to a second part of the first story.
2824;"I may take it out and put it on the ""community table"" for anyone that wants it."
2825;A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday.
2826;Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.
2827;And what style it has.
2828;Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade.
2829;away drawn shots, as opposed to the live.
2830;There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie.
2831;For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road.
2832;II such a pleasurable experience.
2833;If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City.
2834;This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.
2835;the acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.
2836;There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.
2837;That is far better fun than a single.
2838;I'm sure they taste great, though.
2839;With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.
2840;Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.
2841;For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.
2842;The success can be traced primarily to two individuals: director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.
2843;Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.
2844;Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.
2845;This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.
2846;The movie truly is that good.
2847;Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.
2848;One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).
2849;Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.
2850;"You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, ""You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul."""
2851;each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight.
2852;Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.
2853;In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.
2854;The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would.
2855;The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.
2856;There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.
2857;"For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word ""eyes"" they go from black and white to a subtle green."
2858;i honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.
2859;But all that aside, people need to see this because it is one of the best and most original films of the past couple of years.
2860;Beautiful movie with great cinematic moments.
2861;It's stunning to watch and has a classic story feel a la 50's detective style.
2862;The acting was good and I can't wait and hope for a sequal
2863;It is certainly an excellent movie.
2864;This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity.
2865;let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art!
2866;Pay attention to the other viewer reviews, positive and negative.
2867;They're telling a pretty consistent story.
2868;As repellant as I found this movie to be, they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point.
2869;I found it pretty darn misogynistic really, but it just may be your cup of tea.
2870;Just one step below great.
2871;The visuals are awesome of courseand so is the acting.
2872;it's an action packed and gory thrill ride.
2873;All three stories manage to keep your interested throughout the entire two hours.
2874;Out of all the stories I'd sayMickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man outto get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend.
2875;it's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actuallygood at the sametime.
2876;btw, Rosario Dawson is hot in this one!
2877;And Bruce Willis seemsto be getting it back together alittle bit with his solid Bmovie Hostage and now this.
2878;mash of several of the comic's stories.
2879;How they got name stars to appear in this bomb is amazing to me.
2880;I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot.
2881;The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world.
2882;It always seems like the bad guys are rich , powerful and on the edge of winning or pulling off some unspeakable crime like child torture and killing,but the good guys take the bullets and come back for more.
2883;"it has the outline of ""Pulp Fiction"", the style of ""The Matrix"", the darkness and gritty feel of the ""Spawn"" comic series
2884;With bit of a """"Punisher"""" feel as well, if you take a look in the movie."""
2885;"It also has the whole innovative comic like feel of ""Hell Boy""."
2886;"the film is based on Frank Miller's creation of the original ""Sin City"" graphic novels
2887;Before, I watched the film I didn't real know what to aspect or hope for until, well I started watching the movie.
2888;I love the CGI animation, and the whole comic book feel.
2889;There are many other charcters as well like Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, Eliah Wood, Devon Aoki, and some others.
2890;He is up in years, but still as tough as ever.
2891;The major is crooked and of course has many connections"
2892;He wants answers, and is willing to kill his way to find answers.
2893;This film is very dark and gritty with a ganster feel.
2894;"After 7 years he's back and he is able to track down her who has really grown up and turns out to be (Jessica Alba)
2895;Basically, Hartigan is the hero like redemption story and must finish what he started years ago.
2896;the world of Basin city is very complex and explict """"Sin City"""" is very, stylish and entertaining film."""
2897;Sin City though is a little darker for some people's tastes so you'll either absolutely love the film or absolutely hate the movie.
2898;"THis film is awesome
2899;overall I will give this film a 4/5, a great film with loads of style.
2900;Acting: 5/5 I loved all the characters but especially Rourke's character, that character was pretty much made for him and heck Willis is an expert at playing the role of a cop"
2901;Loved the comic book style, with the Matrix/ Pulp Fiction feel.
2902;Absolutely loved the black and white gangster/underground feel as well!!!
2903;Kudos to (Tarantino, Rodriguez) and the creator Frank Miller.
2904;showtime Value: 4/5 Great film!!!
2905;The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain.
2906;The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested.
2907;white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post.
2908;Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based.
2909;great movie, dark and gritty, and amazingly sexy.
2910;i recommend it to anyone who likes film noir.
2911;its a lot of fun, in a dark, gloomy kinda way.
2912;I just came back from an advance screening Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch film.
2913;Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century.
2914;Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B and W with digital.
2915;I thought the style and cinematography were genius.
2916;Give people an option, and give them a break while they're at it?
2917;Lots of actors I like to watch.
2918;Lots of plot twists, if you like that.
2919;This is the film version of the Frank Miller Graphic novel and it shows.
2920;If you could take the graphic novel into the theater with you, you could read along.
2921;it helps to be a fan of Frank Miller's work when you go see this movie.
2922;The movie has some great scenes and dialogue.
2923;Marv steals the movie, IMHO.
2924;This is a beautiful movie to watch.
2925;All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist.
2926;Each time seeing more, appreciating SC's depth.
2927;this set also comes with a mini version of Frank Miller's original Sin City comic book.
2928;packaging is great and not cumbersome.
2929;existent, much like the first release of Kill Bill.
2930;Frank Miller's gritty tale of Sin City is summed up for us in this masterpiece with excellent visual effects, damn sexy women, and some of some hard.
2931;nails men narrating the stories.
2932;Even if the story was crap, it's visually stunning.
2933;Turns out though, it's fantastic.
2934;recommended if you like Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, etc.
2935;An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.
2936;I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.
2937;the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.
2938;in 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.
2939;It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.
2940;they all do fine jobs.
2941;He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.
2942;The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.
2943;it is definitely a dark thriller with a touch of color here and there.
2944;hartigan and Marv are my absolute favorite charachters in this film.
2945;hartigan is a good cop with a sense of honor that you don't see anywhere else in the movie and Marv is the biggest meanest thug in Sin City willing to do whatever it takes to avenge his love Goldie.
2946;A nice change for once.
2947;The movie is great, really hits all the parts from the graphic novel like it was taken from book to screen from frame to frame.
2948;I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert.
2949;And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it.
2950;That alone will keep me from ever watching this movie again.
2951;It is a great movie.
2952;It is SO violent, SO intense, that those with weak stomachs will not even be able to bear the soundtrack's hard jazz saxophone grunts and techno beats or the unrelenting violence that lasts throughout a vast majority of the two.
2953;studded cast, filled with men that make girls cream and chicks that make boys (like me) salivate.
2954;All of them, among many others.
2955;Also, fans of Japanese animation from ADV Films should know Jason Douglas, who does a good job on screen as a hitman.
2956;also notable is that the film really does well illustrating the atmosphere of the comic.
2957;I like his grittinesss, his unflinching way of looking at Reality, and his quiet confidence in the concept of Film Noir.
2958;and i love Robert Rodriguez' fun send.
2959;films, which bundled technical whiz.
2960;So i expected Rodriguez' Heart, Miller's Soul, and gritty Reality from both.
2961;has its nice touches: the look of the film is *great* and Jessica Alba can't be beat as a tough kid in a nasty city.
2962;The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.
2963;All of the men are murderers, even the police.
2964;There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time.
2965;The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl.
2966;"Director Robert Rodriguez said, ""Actors want to create memorable characters
2967;It is based on the short """"The Customer is Always Right"""" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers."""
2968;The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories.
2969;Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.
2970;It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received.
2971;Each of these adds to the shock value.
2972;overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.
2973;The sexuality, violence, and unusual film.
2974;making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill.
2975;"When things go wrong for the situations that happened for these 3 guys, they a
2976;I mean, this is nearly true comic brought to life.
2977;Sin City is definitly a comic book brought to life.
2978;After a couple of action sceneswith Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry.
2979;When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there.
2980;This is my first and last experience with on.
2981;demand video viewing through Amazon.
2982;While there isn't a great plot, it's so stylish and beautifuly done it's hard not to enjoy.
2983;One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals"
2984;"bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his ""Diehard."
2985;(Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc) Not me.
2986;"elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin
2987;This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.
2988;Robert Rodriguez, one of the """"young turk"""" filmmakers of the '90s, I think, now suffers from the """"Lucas Syndrome"""" ."""
2989;"Yet it was good for the movies' sake, because ""Sin City"" was yet another bold new direction for Sir Robert."
2990;Here, he made the film medium adapt to the comics, and created something new.
2991;Something truly revolutionary in film.
2992;Something that was disturbingly beautiful.
2993;He did more than make four of Frank Miller's noir series work on film .
2994;he (along with Miller, who gets a co. directing nod) made film work around the comic's artistic motifs.
2995;but we see the complete Sin City stories recut, added to, and retold, yet again in their original format.
2996;2005 came out with an exciting adaptation of Frank Miller's exciting graphic novel, Sin City, based on three of Miller's immensely popular and immensely gritty books (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard).
2997;jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.
2998;"i liked the guy who was in love with Goldie, who was murdered in his bed as she slept
2999;[END SPOILER)Frank Miller took """"funny books"""" and made them exciting entertainment"
3000;Funny, I like S. c. better.
3001;The sheer visual impact was spellbinding .
3002;In any case, I will make this part of my personal collection.
3003;If the aim of the director was to emulate a comic book, then this is a success.
3004;Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame.
3005;the stories are fun and suspensful.
3006;the best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women.
3007;I love the electric chair scene.
3008;other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it.
3009;The others are comic book inspired flicks butthis is actually a moving visualization of a comic book.
3010;this gets an A+ for the artistic effect and a B+ for the movie content.
3011;This is a very intense story.
3012;The cinematography is quite unique and provides a visually stunning backdrop that gives it a flair for the unbelievable .
3013;Sin City is fabulous at what it tries to be, a piece of noir fiction that let's us believe that the good will always win out over the bad.
3014;Only, the good people find something worthwhile to stand up for and that redeems them.
3015;I enjoyed the film as a whole but have to admit that Mickey Rourke's Marv stole the show.
3016;Bruce Willis gave me pretty much what I expected and I found Clive Owen surprisingly good in a tough.
3017;Sin City throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra.
3018;"a revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows ""Sin City"" to be told in the same stark black."
3019;white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.
3020;There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black.
3021;I'll just give you my reaction.
3022;"Sin City is one of those movies that qualifies as a ""Great Guilty Pleasure."""
3023;top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.
3024;"Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but ""they don't do nuance."""
3025;There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.
3026;"all in all, ""Sin City"" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a ""Valkyrie,"" and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard."
3027;I had a great experience.
3028;Sin City with Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba is a great flick!!!!
3029;The movie has a great cast and a awesome story line and its just a great flick!!!!!!
3030;I love this movie and you should totally get the blu.
3031;ray version because it is super crispy clear and sharp!
3032;This movie kicks but in such an amazing way.
3033;The movie plays in A black and white setting but it works very well for the tone of the movie.
3034;A good movie for anyone looking for A good action flick.
3035;I guess if you are a big fan of this kind of comic book you will love it.
3036;This is the best movie that was made this year.
3037;He did a great job playing Marv.
3038;He did a great job.
3039;Frank Miller's immensely popular noir comic books come to the screen with the perfection of a skilled film.
3040;maker, a man that has made some wonderful films.
3041;Sin City is the epitome of comic.
3042;I have never read a comic so damn entertaining and grounded.
3043;film adaptation so damn close to its source material.
3044;The tone is always dark and brooding, with a light comic touch, narrated in such a way as to mimic the style of a 50's crime novel.
3045;A beautiful woman lies next to him on the bed, naked as the day she was born, and gleaming in full color while all around her is laced in black and white.
3046;And Marv wants to know how and why.
3047;But this pedophile is the son of a powerful and corrupt senator.
3048;Crap hits the fan, needless to say.
3049;Try reading one of the comics and then watch the film, you'll be amazed at the intricacy.
3050;It is truly a masterpiece of design.
3051;Robert Rodriguez directs this film as if using Frank Miller's comics as storyboards, where all the shots were set up as many as fifteen years ago.
3052;Each actor's ability on screen shines forth with ferocity and dedication.
3053;every shot, every scene, every nuance of Sin City is like a painted picture, one that can be free of its bonds on paper and flow with grace, creating a perfect whole of film noir and comic violence.
3054;This is one of the most exciting, intense, and beautifully shot movies I have ever seen.
3055;The characters and story are wonderfully brilliant.
3056;It is an extremely graphic movie (gorey,in parts), so certainly not for everyone.
3057;I loved this movie to death, but once again the studios are trying to screw you.
3058;For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform.
3059;star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!)
3060;against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series.
3061;It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.
3062;You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff.
3063;"Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of ""The Hard Goodbye"" so you can compare the film to the source material."
3064;"Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the ""he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea"" statement."
3065;Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring.
3066;rich and unforgettable characters such as Hulk.
3067;a huge surprise for me, was the part of Kevin, the cannibal, played by Elijah Wood.
3068;Sure, it surprised me that he was cast for the role at all, but more astonishing was that he played the part so convincingly.
3069;An actor that I until recently found difficult not to associate with a gay halfling named Frodo Baggins had broken free of that mold with simply an eerie, whackjob facial expression and a welcome muteness that lasted the entirety of the film.
3070;Violent and ruthless, yet beautiful and seductive they were.
3071;stimulating perspective, surely had the most worthwhile scene of the movie, and should, as far as I'm concerned, never have to put clothes on again.
3072;to summarize, Sin City was a superb example of what the combination of great casting and a wonderfully dirty imagination are capable of producing.
3073;Thanks so much Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, and I am in eager anticipation of more sin to come.
3074;I am a big fan of graphic novels, so to see one made into a live action film was unreal.
3075;ray has a nice amount of material to kick back and watch, and even has an interactive game, which while kind of cheesy was also cool.
3076;But the content is pretty good and interesting.
3077;Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue.
3078;The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow.
3079;The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers.
3080;captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times.
3081;An original movie with a great cast.
3082;This was a great stylistic film to start out with.
3083;15 minute film school rules, commentaries rule, and the all green screen version of the film is pretty cool too.
3084;I always finish watching his special features feeling like I have really learned something about the film making process.
3085;You gotta love a director who really seems to enjoy helping others to learn about the craft.
3086;The directors Miller, Rodriguez, and the ever wonderful Tarantino nailed it (of course)!!!!
3087;A must see and own!
3088;Sit back and fasten your seat belt.
3089;This movie is a knockout.
3090;The amazing cast mixed in with the directing style of Robert Rodriguez (excluding his family stuff) and Tarantino, this is how a graphic novel should look on the big screen, and little screen
3091;They also manage to keep the dialogue and internal monologue intact which are both a merit and a major problem with the film.
3092;It also makes it easier to swallow the use of bright highlights of color and the exaggerated cartoon violence.
3093;Great Cast+Great Filmmaker+Great StoryGreat Movie, i have watched it over and overSpecial features go into great detail about film making .
3094;I saw the movie at theaters and I love it just as much on Blu.
3095;I love the extended footage as well.
3096;My prediction: Sin City will become the Road Warrior of the next 10 years.
3097;That movie also was considered a bit cultish on its release and wasn't a huge theatrical success.
3098;But through word of mouth it became one of the most popular films among young and youngish males.
3099;this movie brings to life what comic books really feel like in the mind of the reader (albeit a comic book directed at young male adults).
3100;all of the stories are interesting and visually compelling, but very violent.
3101;"It succeeds (and then some) at what ""The Crow"" only hinted at."
3102;There's a license to create a world that could only exist in comic books and that license is fully utilized.
3103;The way people talk and act and the look of the world they live in is disturbingly unreal and that's as it should be, it's based on a comic book after all.
3104;He makes us feel like a window has been opened and we are watching someone who lives in that world.
3105;I can't guarantee that you'll love this movie.
3106;But I can pretty much guarantee that, if you read all the reviews and know what to expect going in, and you still decide to go ahead, then you will love this.
3107;It had a good plot and the comic.
3108;book feel of the production worked well.
3109;I would recommend this to anyone who likes their drama with a dark side.
3110;Don't get me wrong, I'm far from Catholic but I still respect those people more than most religions.
3111;I for one preferred it the first time around.
3112;Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star.
3113;The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.
3114;It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder.
3115;i can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.
3116;Movie is awesome and the special features are cool.
3117;The creation of this film is a story in and of itself, and no streaming service is going to give you that.
3118;Great variety of actors in this movie!!!
3119;You cant beat the cast of characters in this movie, very well done!!!!
3120;I really enjoyed this movie.
3121;In fact, as far as comic book movies go, this was perfect.
3122;robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) did an amazing job with the filming.
3123;I love the way they used live actors with CGI backgrounds.
3124;This paints a very somber mood for the movie.
3125;Everyone did a superb job.
3126;"He was perfect for the role and it just feels like he was the heart of Sin City
3127;Bruce Willis is finally starting to play his age.
3128;In this he played an old cop with a heart condition.
3129;Everyone just seemed to have fun playing their role and it was entertaining to watch them.
3130;i do recommend it to all ages.
3131;great superb cast as well.
3132;roaring ready to introduce movie audiences to the mad genius that is Frank Miller.
3133;creating the acclaimed comic creator's most personal work, co. director Robert Rodriguez has given Miller's creation the chance to live and breathe using the exact hard.
3134;The end result is a mad brushstroke of digital filmmaking that is risqu enough to be considered bold, while palatable enough for exploitive entertainment purposes.
3135;conservative ideals, the film is so full of gleeful graphic violence and raw, steaming sexuality that there's sure to be some kind of backlash somewhere.
3136;The cast is a knockout, with major kudos going to Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and even a smaller, supporting appearance by Rutger Hauer as they fulfill their inspired casting choices and take delicious delight in this world of corruption and sleaze.
3137;white visuals are the real star here though, merging film noir sensibilities and dynamic comic panel storytelling with the help of a heap.
3138;load of computer graphics and inventive filmmaking to create something that's new, raw, and refreshing.
3139;Still, after years of being jerked around in Hollywood, Miller is finally given the tools to strut his stuff on the big screen and, love it or leave it, perfect or not, that's exactly what Sin City is.
3140;First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in , not color as advertised.
3141;It is a brutally violent film noir, co. directed and co. written by Miller and Rodriguez"
3142;a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car.
3143;The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending.
3144;It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.
3145;If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.
3146;"watching the video on a new Panasonic ZT 65"" Plasma set was an epiphany of incredible color grading."
3147;Now on Blu Ray, and still at a $7.99 price at Walmarts, I am very happy to have this film in my Blu Ray collection.
3148;It's funny how opinions can change after a few viewings.
3149;It is one of the best movies you will possibly see and is amongst the best graphic novel based movies you will probably ever experiance.
3150;"The movie pays tribute to the great film Noir genre, throughout the movie, the director utilizes a series of predominantly black an white color palates while using color only for specific ""popping"" effect."
3151;this movie has a wonderful gritty, deep, feel that perfectly portrays the dark underworld that it is narrating.
3152;The cast in the movie is phenominal, and the acting is amazing.
3153;This movie has the best of all possible worlds in movie making.
3154;it has violence, a deep story line, sex, and action that keeps you wanting more and more.
3155;I absolutely loved this movie, and you will too, it is phenominal.
3156;Get the unrated version, it is worth the extra money.
3157;This movie was fantastic and the blue.
3158;ray is just as good.
3159;This is a great movie and worth the price.
3160;It's nice to have many options and this disk has that.
3161;"The film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever."
3162;The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.
3163;the acting is good, though.
3164;good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.
3165;but it really worked, I've never read the comic books but I loved it all the same, the acting is good, the stories are interesting and exciting and it's just beautiful to look at.
3166;I highly recommend seeing this movie.
3167;This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.
3168;The trailer seemed made perfectly to attract the way.
3169;ward movie goers into seeing something, finally, worth seeing.
3170;Artisticlly it was a great turn for a graphic comic translation.
3171;sin City is a great movie of 2005, right up there with Batman Begins and Star Wars Ep 3.
3172;Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co. director Miller.
3173;The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity).
3174;As an experiment in aesthetics, it works .
3175;it's fun, it's technically interesting.
3176;strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style.
3177;The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.
3178;Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.
3179;But in a town this self.
3180;"The film breaths, speaks and looks just like the comic's very people and locations
3181;Furthermore, the special effects (most of the movie was filmed against a green screen) are seamless and create a look in the film that is absolutely beautiful.
3182;I also love the fact that Robert Rodriquez insisted that Frank Miller work as a co. director in the movie (along with Quentin Tarantino) much to the chagrin of the director's guild.
3183;The result is that the film retains all the richness of Miller's vision and style (unlike movies that promise a faithfulness to a particular author but in reality never deliver the proverbial goods.
3184;Sin City is definitely for mature audiences only.
3185;At any rate, along with """"Batman Begins"""" """"Sin City"""" is the best comic book movie I've ever seen."""
3186;caesar gives two enthusiastic thumbs up!
3187;Brilliant imagery, brilliant dialogue at times, and well packaged.
3188;visually stunning and with enough gross.
3189;If the two planned Sin City movie sequels are made, perhaps he will redeem himself with a broader range of character types with more depth and believability.
3190;Wow such a visually stunning movie witha superstar cast all delivering supersar performances.
3191;mickey Rourke as marve is the stand out, but all the connected mini storys are highly entertaining and charasmatic.
3192;the cinema photography is stunning with black and white being used to emphasis color of stand out features like red lips, greeen eyes, bright white blood, its like watching a comic book actually burst into life.
3193;While they all have less than respectable professions, they are all strong, unique characters, and I think that pretty much lets Frank off the hook.
3194;in a more general sense, this movie is about a film noir kind of town.
3195;Howeveer, the visual style of it all is so compelling that it looks remarkably similar to the comic opus.
3196;That said, this film is a work of art, in that it is visually compelling and wonderfully written.
3197;It is gritty and violent, but there is a beauty to it all.
3198;I just thought that the imagery in the commercial was striking and so I went to a matinee.
3199;i have read in other reviews that the movie is more of a recreation than an adaptation of Miller's comics.
3200;Now, as I have stated, I don't have any first hand knowledge of this particular comic, but I have seen enough comics to know that this is the most faithful and evocative depiction of the comic strip form that I have ever seen on film.
3201;Visually, Sin City is stunning.
3202;It is a comic strip come to life.
3203;"budget sleaze"" film, this movie is great."
3204;I just had to get used to the idea of absolutely no intelligence and then I settled in and enjoyed the spectacle.
3205;Very interesting movie with some great actors.
3206;I'd read all the reviews and hype but was pleasantly surprised and pleased that the movie surpassed all my expectations.
3207;I thought the style was quite interesting, black and white with touches of color.
3208;The narrative style reminded me of some of the old private eye radio shows.
3209;There were some interesting stories.
3210;I very rarely watch violent movies, especially if there is gratuitous, unnecessary violence (Jason movies, HellRaiser), but I can appreciate the stylized, unusual look of the film and the stories vignettes were interesting.
3211;Sin City is the closest that mainstream US film has come to capturing the essence and appeal of graphic novels.
3212;visually stunning, each frame of this movie is highly stylised, no less than a work of art in itself, to closely resemble the style of the graphic novels themselves.
3213;it is set in the twisted environment of Sin City, part modern day, part film noir era, where among the heroes are Marv (Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk of a man on a trail of vengeance) and Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis doing the kind of role he was made for).
3214;Like Tarantino's movies, the violence is a dramatic device, and also a vehicle for humour.
3215;plus, the storylines and source material are great with plenty of twists and turns that you rarely see in mainstream US movies these days.
3216;I think Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are outstanding in this film and are perfectly cast.
3217;this movie is a triumph and hopefully sets a new standard to be matched by future productions.
3218;Theme: Protect what matters to you most by any means necessary.
3219;I loved this movie a lot.
3220;They have very important roles in the movie.
3221;Its very interesting and a little bit bizarre.
3222;"But my favorite part of the movie is the segment ""Big Fat Kill"" its where Clive Owens character is very angry by the way Jackie Boy is treating his new girlfriend Shellie."
3223;This does have some confusing parts but it is indeed a very good story.
3224;Suddenly he says Becky do you want a smoke and she gets really scared and shocked then she says a dramatic I love you to her mom and she knows that will be her last conversation with her mom.
3225;It can be really confusing but i loved it anyways.
3226;Sure, the comic book imagery is great, if you're into that kind of thing, with stark black and white colors occasionally splattered with vivid red blood during this movie's many violent fight scenes and shootings.
3227;The screen is equally splattered as other characters take multiple bullet wounds without dying, in true comic book form.
3228;"Mickey Rourke offers his best performance since ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,"" while Bruce Willis shines in his best movie since ""Hudson Hawk."""
3229;stay away from this movie unles you like Black and white movies.
3230;It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city.
3231;Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself.
3232;It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.
3233;but still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved.
3234;That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone.
3235;despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i. e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well.
3236;as far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico.
3237;I always find it interesting to browse through the reviews.
3238;Everyone knows what opinions are like.
3239;New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate.
3240;The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity.
3241;Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art.
3242;The sets, the characters, and the CGI were all outstanding.
3243;almost the entire film is in deep, dark black and piercingly bright white, you really feel like you're in a comic book.
3244;I recommend this film to anyone who likes comic books, graphic violence, or just wants to see a great story and interesting characters.
3245;The film has a very unique visual style of the likes I've never really seen before.
3246;It's like a comic come to life and it was very well done.
3247;saying reviewers ), simply ground breaking and fresh.
3248;frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez take hardboiled noir crime fiction and compact it into a diamond of a movie, shot through with hardboiled lugs, an honest cop and oh.
3249;The three principle male character are all good guys .
3250;The girls in Old Town are all in charge of their lives and are quite possibly the strongest group characters in the movie.
3251;The dialogue fits perfectly to the movie.
3252;even Mikey Rourke's last line is so pitch perfect to his character.
3253;The entire dialogue is spot on for the genre.
3254;it's a movie, from a set of graphic novels.
3255;That's oh so satisfying on a fundamentally moral level.
3256;d) Jessica Alba's relationship with Bruce's character.
3257;As I said previously, all the principle male charcaters are essentially good guys and do the right thing in the end.
3258;I can quite easily accept that her affection for the one man who ever showed her kindness could, over time in a place as morally bankrupt as Sin City, become something deeper for her ( and so more difficult for him ).
3259;The characters all cross paths, that's all.
3260;to conclude, this is one of the best movies of 2005, a perfect fit of style and more style.
3261;Now, that's a mighty fine leathercoat your wearin'.
3262;"But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)""Sin City"" is much in the same way and inspiration as that of ""Pulp Fiction"" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film."
3263;"If you like ""Fiction"" you'll love ""Sin""."
3264;Sin City consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.
3265;the first two stories bookend the film.
3266;At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life.
3267;Mickey Rouke and Bruce Wills had great roles in this movie
3268;Sin City, based on a popular series of graphic novels, captures the signature comic book style of creator Frank Miller, which involves black and white images with highlights of color for dramatic effect, extreme violence, brutality, misogyny, and torture.
3269;Even Superman and Batman would wince at the parameters Miller has widened in the field of comic art.
3270;ray edition contains both the theatrical and a recut, extended, unrated version.
3271;There are a slew of bonus extras to make fans of Miller's creation happy.
3272;Everything about this film is amazing, stylish, and plainly eye candy with each action scene eclipsing the last.
3273;"This film is based on the comic book series called ""Sin City"", and this movie has such detail and is able to explain the entire world surrounding it in one movie, which is like 4 short movies in one!!!"
3274;"It is one of those films that some people will love, like, or hate
3275;It has that dark and gritty feel to it, along with an exotic take on the city, and how Basin City (Sin City) is!!!
3276;Rodregiuz and Tarantino team up to make an innovative and original film, that will change the way you look at films like it or not!!!
3277;This movie is a combination of when """"Nightmare on Elm Street"""" meets """"The Matrix"""", mixed with """"Spawn"""", along with the """"Godfather"""" feel in a comic form, with plainly awesome innovative visually effects!!!"""
3278;It also has a little bit of a mystery feel to it!!!
3279;fair trade, as he gives his life to protect her!!!
3280;What can, I say can you can tell, by giving brief descritions of the movie that this is unique from anyother movie I've seen!!!
3281;Most of this movie has that larger than life feel, in the underworld feel, with a lot of star power to top it all off!!!
3282;"It's kind of has the feel that ""Kill Bill"" films had if you know what I mean!!!"
3283;This film has a lot of creativity and will be a gem for a fan of comic books, dark gritty, action, with nice black and white visual eye candy with 4 stories in one movies along with some great special effects on disc 2!!!
3284;Love or hate it, you got admit this film is the first of it's kind and is the absolute most stylish, fil of the year!!!
3285;It was surprisind and completely unexpected, but very artsy, overall not the best, but definettly the most stylish!!!
3286;This item arrived on time and in very good condition.
3287;This is one of a very small handful of movies that I would want to own.
3288;This is a classic comic book movie, it is indefinitely the best movie based on a comic to stick to what happened in the comics.
3289;This movie is a story of revenge, lust, and murder (which yea are sins you Christians, hence the name sin city) and I absolutely loved it and I believe frank miller is a genius, and for those of you whom enjoyed it they are making 2 more at the moment, but may still make more, and I also recommended the graphic novels.
3290;Sin City is by far one of the most creative and stunningly well.
3291;They used basically no set for the whole thing, but everything looks so real (in a surreal kind of way).
3292;And, the use of color is just brilliant.
3293;The movie is mostly black and white, but other colors are sporadically thrown in for emphasis, and to brilliant effect.
3294;The flashes of red blood, the cold, murderous stare of Elijah Wood, Alexis Bledel's gorgeous blue eyes, the vivid, um yellowness of the Yellow Bastard, all are brought out wonderfully amidst a black and white world.
3295;The performances are all great as well.
3296;Bruce Willis has long shed his action hero image, for which he was once well.
3297;"Elijah Wood is just amazing as the silent but deadly Kevin, and of course we have Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, and many other lovely women with sedutive and memorable roles (I wish I'd known when they were filming this
3298;over narrations of each one help to keep things interesting, and to demand your attention.
3299;Much like """"Kill Bill"""", it sort of skips around chronologically, but I think the story is initially much easier to follow overall."""
3300;anyway, this is a fantastic movie that any fan of excellent cinema should see.
3301;"Robert Rodriguez has said that he wants to make movies of the entire ""Sin City"" series (and Johnny Depp is even slated to be in one), so I greatly look forward to the next installment."
3302;The acting is great , the movie is awesome for it's comic book style.
3303;Great film, could find so many words to describe how good it was, would take too long to write.
3304;Acting was awesome and the story was actually pretty good.
3305;I don't understand why Bruce Willis agreed to be in this steamy turd of a movie, because he is a good actor and he's been in some really good movies.
3306;There were great reviews, fantastic previews etc.
3307;first the good parts of the film: The style of the film, and the black and white colouring with some highlights in colour are maqnificent to look at and gives a fantastic feel to the movie.
3308;You really feel like you are watching the comic book by Frank Miller.
3309;So if you love the comic, this movie is for you.
3310;then the actors do a fine job, a great starcast is on board.
3311;the stories that are told in the film are cool onces and very interesting.
3312;This is the first time I can say the following of a movie:It defenitly deserves it's R rating.
3313;so all in all, this movie is entertaining, but beware:This movie is defenitly not for the onces who have a weak stomach.
3314;"Sin City, directed by Robert Rodriguez (""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Spy Kids"") and Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novels the film is based on) tells a number of stories, which share characters and themes."
3315;each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s.
3316;"like much of the ""Spy Kids"" films, Rodriguez shot most of ""City"" in front of a blue screen."
3317;The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray.
3318;They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world.
3319;This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material.
3320;Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book.
3321;"In ""City"", it all serves to draw us in."
3322;the unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe.
3323;"Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of ""Sin City"" as a `real place'."
3324;"A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story
3325;In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts.
3326;Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective.
3327;All of these actors do a great job of helping to make """"Sin City"""" all the more engaging."""
3328;"the interconnecting stories will probably bring ""Pulp Fiction"" to mind for many."
3329;The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait.
3330;I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films.
3331;"In ""Sin City"", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy, but takes it to another degree."
3332;"He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico""."
3333;"He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action
3334;Somehow, this is also fitting.
3335;Sin City is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time.
3336;It has a dazzling visual style all its own, combined with a hard.
3337;boiled story and some very good performances, """"Sin City"""" will be remembered for years to come."""
3338;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
3339;It does an excellent job capturing the essence of the Graphic Novels of Frank Miller, probably because of the close working relationship between Miller and the Director.
3340;When you watch the film it feels like you are reading a comic book where the story relies more on the visual than the dialog to advance the story, and the visuals are truly one of a kind.
3341;The film is shot so it matches the story board of the comic book frame by frame down to the smallest detail.
3342;While this movie is not for everyone people who like Pulp Fiction and comic books should enjoy it.
3343;As interesting and well done as the movie is from a visual standpoint, I couldn't have cared less about the characters.
3344;She does an amazing job with what she's given.
3345;The books were so unique, even for the comic book medium, that I knew they would be tough to adapt on film.
3346;The end result is one of the most faithful films to its source material in the comic to movie genre ever made.
3347;This helps to set the tone at the start, as well as put on a proper coda for the movie.
3348;What he finds out is both unsettling and brilliant at the same time.
3349;While I am not a Tarantino fan by any means, I appreciate his work on this film, and his friendship with Rodriguez.
3350;that Yellow Bastard Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a rare honest cop in Sin City.
3351;The true success though really has to do with Miller's characters and the way Rodriguez doesn't alter them to make them more Hollywood.
3352;The performances from the cast are first rate and help sell everything else.
3353;Like the books, the noir flavor shine through, while allowing for a dash of licence.
3354;A feature length audio commentary with Rodriguez and Miller, a second audio commentary with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Bruce Willis, and a third audio track featuring audience reaction at the premiere in Austin.
3355;The commentaries give you a well rounded look at how things came together, from both a creative standpoint and actor perspective.
3356;The reaction track is a hoot and worth a listen as you watch the film.
3357;There's also a series of featurettes on everything from Miller and Tarantino, to the film's cars, props, make.
3358;that said they are worth watching.
3359;An interactive character time line and the theatrical trailers top off the disc.
3360;disc Two includes an extended cut of each story.
3361;But there's some meaty additions in That Yellow Bastard and The Hard Goodbye that fans should like.
3362;Focusing on the CGI effects, a high.
3363;My favoritefilm this year is Batman Begins, and now I am a fan ofFrank Millers work on the Batman comics as well.
3364;And what I really love about the film is that itis rated R for just about every reason you can think of.
3365;it's got laughs, romance, lesbians, cannibalism, and somuch more.
3366;I liked the style and the stories.
3367;my favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'.
3368;To me it's the most poignant and visceral.
3369;This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people.
3370;Admittedly, this was my favorite film of the year in its original form.
3371;fully capturing Frank Miller's incredible vision in glorious black and white (and red and yellow).
3372;Everything serves to deepen and enrich the amazing world of Basin City.
3373;i haven't made it through all of the new extras yet (on the second disc), but two are definitely worth noting.
3374;The 15 minute Flic School (a staple of Rodriguez's special editions) is great and focuses on the process of shooting in the digital domain .
3375;one surprise was learning that many of the actors who work together seamlessly in the film never actually met in person.
3376;Ahh the magic of digital editing.
3377;the companion piece to the flic school is an all greenscreen version of the theatrical release.
3378;great for Bruce Willis and it shows more than the theatrical release and great special effects
3379;In order to put page to screen within a tidy two hour package, it is absolutely necessary to change elements of the comic that will get even casual fans up in arms.
3380;Also, comic books overwhelmingly tend to feature characters and events that defy reality, making special effects take front and center over the characters that are often the main appeal in the first place.
3381;Shot entirely with digital cameras and using very few sets, it is clear Rodriguez had a ball making the picture, but as all students of film know, making a good movie is about as fun as a root canal with no painkillers.
3382;Next up is Clive Owen butchering an American accent as Dwight, one of those people who doesn't seem to have a specific role in society but who still manages to get himself and an entire town full of prostitutes into grave danger.
3383;in adapting Frank Miller's excellent work to screen, Rodriguez brought everything but the kitchen sink and the soul.
3384;it is interesting that both Rodriguez and Sin City are so frequently compared to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.
3385;"Rodriguez and Tarantino are good friends, and Tarantino even ""guest directed"" a short segment of Sin City."
3386;As I watched that segment, I longingly thought of Tarantino's films, celebrations of all that is film and pop culture, bringing the best elements of both together.
3387;Watching anything by Tarantino gives you the awe.
3388;inspiring sense of watching a master at the top of his game, while Sin City just makes you sadly shake your head at a big kid playing with his digital toys.
3389;in the real world police work is a grind.
3390;Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book.
3391;to create viewer interest things are made simple.
3392;There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them.
3393;One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.
3394;First off, the visual imagery in this film is creative, true to the graphic novels, and powerful.
3395;Second, they used Mickey Rourke perfectly with the makeup and his build, he was perfect to play the character of Marv.
3396;and the film stayed true to that.
3397;The use of color in some scenes was also visually powerful.
3398;I would very much recommend this film for those who are interested in this genre (though I honestly wouldn't know how to classify this one, other than action.
3399;For fans of Jessica Alba, well, you won't be disappointed, either.
3400;This movie is one of the best movies of all time.
3401;Very action oriented with a dark grimy feel to it.
3402;One of the extras is a mini video game.
3403;By far this is one of the most visually impressive movies ever!
3404;Overall this is a movie worth owning.
3405;A fun time for all.
3406;A brilliant work, if only it was written by a highschool prodigy, but for a major Hollywood work, it only serves to reinforce the stereotype that it takes little to impress fanboys.
3407;ray edition and I persuaded her to revisit the movie in the uncut form.
3408;the bonus materials are among the finest I've ever seen, and I'm a bonus features junkie.
3409;The Recut is nice, especially when you want to watch individual stories like Marv's.
3410;You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.
3411;The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.
3412;Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co. director.
3413;Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.
3414;another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.
3415;From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.
3416;presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a bit more humor than the rest.
3417;The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.
3418;Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.
3419;there are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.
3420;Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.
3421;the film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.
3422;They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.
3423;I could go on and on and tell you the 10 billion reasons why this is one of the best films i have ever watched, but everyone else has already done that.
3424;So simply go out and see this movie and enjoy the visual masterpiece.
3425;The music is also amazing.
3426;He knows exactly how to make the perfect movie to keep everyone entertained.
3427;One of my favorite movies of all time!!!!!!!!
3428;If you're into black and white comic strip stuff with gruesomeness and cute techy show.
3429;When I put it in, I was shocked.
3430;It is an awesome movie!!
3431;The sweet digital backgrounds, the casts, the characters, the colors (and lack of)made me love this movie.
3432;Just give it a chance, you might love it like I do.
3433;She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.
3434;I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.
3435;In fact, almost all actors are excellent .
3436;Though I've never seen the comic book, everybody involved in the making of this movie did a wonderful job.
3437;Definitely great humor for those with a twisted sense.
3438;"Despite the fact that he shoots most of his films in his studio near his Southwestern home (in Texas I believe) and is a filmmaking maverick who not only directs his films, but usually writes, edits, and scores them as well
3439;Rodriquez showed the short to Miller, Miller loved it and the short became the opening sequence to SIN CITY.
3440;the casting for SIN CITY is brilliant and all of the actors do a good job for their roles.
3441;The most exceptional performance is pulled off by Mickey Rourke who plays Marv.
3442;Staying true to the color.
3443;I was impressed by the cinematography.
3444;Technically and cinematographically, the film is brilliant.
3445;It's definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, and even some who do (like myself) will discover later that it.
3446;One disc has the """"Recut"""" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature."""
3447;I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing.
3448;It was a great movie for about 20 minutes, then the novelty with a spash of color wore off, I wish he kept it fresh like Miller in the comics.
3449;He tells a damn good, visceral action tale and blows things up with startling aplomb, but that's about it.
3450;the stories of the film, which I will spare you of, as no doubt everyone else on this site has written it out in great detail, are all very engrossing and told with Rodriguez's prodigious sense pacing and intensity.
3451;What really puts the film over the edge for me, and makes it one step beyond traditional action fare, is the sense of morality and the deeply nuanced characters, all brought to life well by the respective actors, standouts being Del Toro, Owen, Dawson, Rourke and the unfortunately underused Michael Clark Duncan and Brittany Murphy.
3452;and then there are the visuals: Rodriguez and Miller, working directly from the latter's source material, have created an amazing, multi.
3453;faceted and entirely original world on screen.
3454;Never do Rodriguez and Miller let the style take away from the substance, a very admirable feat.
3455;It carrier and emotional depth, a sense of morality, and a vision of its characters that has been crafted with great care by a master hand.
3456;More than anything, this is a film that is striking in the obvious maturity and command of craft of its directors.
3457;When I Began To Watch It i thought i would end up watching another comic book movie like spiderman batman street fighter or x men but this a great movie best action movie of 2005 constatine was good but i like this a lot better Good storyline consedering that the movie Is based on Frank Millers Original Collection Of Comic Books
3458;"A movie that ""cool, enlightening"" kids and/or adults would love."
3459;"Being in High School at the time of it's release it seemed every ""popular"" kid loved this movie."
3460;Great cast, great director, not so great story line = OK movie.
3461;Walk down the right back alley and you can find anything in Sin City, the tagline of Frank Miller's entertaining B&W/Color action packed triumph.
3462;One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before.
3463;A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine.
3464;If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made.
3465;experience the adreline rush and the excitement of this must see and own comic book triumph.
3466;I have the UMD because I like this movie and watch it often while traveling.
3467;You will watch this movie for years and everytime you see it you will know how lucky you are to have a copy of it.
3468;story telling at its best with top.
3469;Well, the appeal of this movie pretty much resides entirely in the coolness factor.
3470;this works wonders in certain segments.
3471;The story of the kid who murders prostitutes, for example, has quite the well.
3472;It is disgusting, exciting, awe.
3473;It's an amazing film when I fast forward through the stupid part, but I can't really give this movie any credit for my own post.
3474;It is now official that Robert Rodriguez will be releasing a full, 2.
3475;If your a fan, and want all of the nooks and crannies, I think you can hold out until late November or early December, trust me, it should be worth it.
3476;I`ve always liked a lot what R. rodriges has been making and this film is not exception, moreover he ( with a help of people like K. tarantino and the author of the comic book ) goes further, digging real deep, exploring new levels of movie production.
3477;I just want to point out at the reaction in the auditorium when I watched this stunning and breathtaking action.
3478;but you always keep in mind that that is a comic book movie version and it`s the way it`s supposed to be.
3479;incredible feeling, I would even say there some emotions there not experienced by you before.
3480;if you like to experience new things, explore new horizons and live.
3481;This movie is heaven for the underground.
3482;See it, and you'll know.
3483;If you loved the book, you will love this tranfer.
3484;I had viewed part of this on TV and was impressed with it and wanted my own copy .
3485;The movie is extremely well done on every level .
3486;hard hitting and fast moving like a visual action comic book .
3487;the characters and acting, make.
3488;up and direction is supurb .
3489;"The one drawback to this UMD, in my opinion, is that the one special feature on it is a ""making of . . ."" featurette."
3490;I really wanted to see this movie.
3491;not because word of mouth said it was amazing.
3492;I wanted to see it because it was something new.
3493;Making film into a comic book rather than movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman where the comic book is adapted to a movie.
3494;So my mind set was positive.
3495;True, some shots looked amazing with the black and white and bits of red.
3496;The male leads were able to pull of some of the lines, but Frank Miller can't write a female character to save his life.
3497;I'm glad Rodriguez was able to but together such good actors, because a group of less talented ones would not be able to control their giggles.
3498;Clive Owen does a great job as Dwight, but the storyline is barely amusing.
3499;the greatest parts of the movie are the opening scene and Bruce Willis's final scene.
3500;The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.
3501;All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt.
3502;Sin City is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.
3503;white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.
3504;"Rodriquez, who is inventing a genre here, has set casting, thematic and technical standards that heighten our expectations (Peter Jackson met them with his ""Rings"" cycle.)"
3505;A little T and A, entertaining story lines, unbelievable use of black and white vs color and Jessica Alba!!
3506;This was by far the best movie of last year.
3507;It's amazing in every way.
3508;The cast was really good and the directing was great.
3509;Alexis Bledel and Jessica Alba both looked great in this film.
3510;I garantee you joy, for hours!The extra stuff gives you a great view over the making of Sin City, everything from the cars to the costumes.
3511;Way smaller then the original size but its still great.
3512;Loved tyhe way it shot.
3513;The black and white mixed with a dash of colors added to its great plot, and helped make this movie even better than it already was.
3514;The dialog fit the format perfectly.
3515;Sin City is now one of my top ten favorite movies.
3516;(4) What a small independent studio looks like.
3517;(5) create better lighting techniques.
3518;What's best about the movie is the visual experience.
3519;The sparing use of color, the digital experimentation, the combination of human actors and cartoon backgrounds, the voice.
3520;All this is very interesting and seductive to watch .
3521;It's ultimately a very sophisticated cartoon.
3522;well, that's also its weakness.
3523;It's edgy, stylish, energetic, its voice is low and growly, all the things boys are.
3524;I really like the way this movie is made.
3525;Lots of my favorite actors in it.
3526;I recommend this movie to cult movie fans all over.
3527;Wait for early 2006 for an extra special edition jam packed with extra discs, extra special goodies amd everything else a body needs!!
3528;"Bloody, violent, sexual without apologies, ""Sin City"" captures the essence of Frank Miller's comic book."
3529;"digitally shot, ""Sin City"" features a terrific cast including cameos from Michael Duncan Clarke, Elija Wood, Britney Murphy, Carla Gugino (who lights up every scene she's in)and other distinguished folks giving the film signficant star power."
3530;the first with co. directors Miller and Rodriguez and the second with Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino.
3531;Rodriguez's jazzy score accompanies this version of the film (played at normal speed).
3532;a hit man (Josh Hartnett)carries out his job in the beginning and ending segments of the film getting close to his subjects and then killing them almost and treating them with surprising tenderness.
3533;He wants to take the guy out as well.
3534;the pedophile is the son of a powerful, corrupt politician (Powers Boothe)and the nephew of an evil Catholic Cardinal (Rutger Haur).
3535;He also wants the one girl that got away.
3536;"a terrific film version of Miller's stories, ""Sin City"" looks brilliant in its Blu."
3537;ray debut with plenty of special features.
3538;New movie from director Robert Rodriquez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino(that alone made me want to see it), based on the comics of Frank Miller.
3539;Here's what you need to know: Uber stylish film noir with plenty of blood n' gore, a great cast including Bruce Willis,Michael Madsen,Clive Owen,Mickey Rourke(and many more) and a pretty good script.
3540;This is both a visual treat and a fun movie.
3541;Shot and edited in digital without any use of film,Exciting and fun and at times violent .
3542;While it's probably a total cliche to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year.
3543;Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic.
3544;novel series, it's an energetic slab of neo.
3545;For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action.
3546;top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.
3547;It's not really that big a deal anyway, because this movie is so impressive visually that the characters could speak in gibberish and I'd probably still be moved to give it at least three stars.
3548;Everything about this movie is utterly outsized, from the themes to the characters to the action, but in the end it's a rousing success at what it intends to do, which is entertain.
3549;"It's precisely because this movie was so utterly entertaining that I found myself unwilling to nitpick
3550;That, ultimately, is the secret to Sin City's success: it's so gripping to watch that it's hard to care about anything else.
3551;white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect.
3552;It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly.
3553;Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.
3554;top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting.
3555;The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done.
3556;Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big.
3557;Well I enjoyed it but it was sort of spooky if you know what i mean.
3558;Good acting, but Bruce Willis is getting old.
3559;Wouldn't recommend it to kids.
3560;The black and white film noir look is great.
3561;It's really nice to see a movie produced in a new way.
3562;(See, you can learn something from watching that awful """"The Incredible Hulk"""" movie.)"""
3563;This is one of the best films i have seen in awhile.
3564;Bruce Willis reminds us why he is one of the best action stars of all time(behind Charles Bronson).
3565;Rosario Dawson shows she has true gritt.
3566;The girl from Gilmore Girls keeps it real all the way to the end.
3567;It will become a film that I will watch over and over again.
3568;Sin City is a strange movie in many ways but it works very well.
3569;The many female characters (one of which is played by Jessica Alba) are extremely attractive and worth the price of admission alone.
3570;This movie gets it right on all levels.
3571;though I've never read the comics by frank miller,I think now's good time to catch up.
3572;make sure you have plenty of popcorn around for this one people!
3573;It is the typical bare bones release of a great movie.
3574;Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years.
3575;It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography.
3576;duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well.
3577;Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker.
3578;Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.
3579;Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.
3580;she's just a nice, honest girl who takes off her clothes for a living.
3581;Just about no one else is that easy to place.
3582;For one, it's at the top of the new noir.
3583;And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.
3584;it's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever.
3585;The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co. director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done.
3586;The actors put in some memorable performances, too .
3587;The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.
3588;this is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen.
3589;That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick.
3590;It's a raw story, though.
3591;It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.
3592;i watched it last night, and it was amazing.
3593;this movie is set in it's own world, in it's own time.
3594;I loved the plots, but I love revenge.
3595;And I loved this movie.
3596;thanks to Frank Miller, Author of original Sin City Graphic novels who have directed this movie too, Ciertaily it's one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen.
3597;Really enjoyed the filming style of this movie and would like to see more movies shot in this format.
3598;In various interviews, Robert Rodriguez has spoken of the upcoming Special Edition (most likely to be released for the holiday season).
3599;A wonderful cinematic interpretation of Frank Miller's series SIN CITY, this movie sinks its fangs right in your heart.
3600;It's a genre movie, one of the very best of its kind, worth having in your personal library.
3601;The fascinating thing about Miller's graphic novel series .
3602;adds enormously to its power, but non.
3603;Nobody does it better than Frank Miller .
3604;While there is plenty to find unfulfilling in this movie, Robert Rodriguez, has a unique vision that recreates the edge and darkness conveyed in Frank Miller's original graphic novels.
3605;wells but in this role, he clearly relishes the power his character possesses.
3606;this movie, while gratuitous in its use of violence and sex, is breathtaking in its presentation of that violence and sex, giving each raw energy and focus that, in such a limited amount of time, captures so much of what was remarkable of Mr. Miller's work.
3607;this is a good movie :( and i wish more people would say that without giving it one star because of no special features.
3608;Everybody that starred in this movie was extrodinary!
3609;This is one of my MOST favorite movies, and I simply fell head over heels in love with Bruce Willis after this!
3610;A great thriller, lots of action and amazing stories.
3611;A great great movie for a great Amazon price!
3612;It's Rodriguez's finest film yet.
3613;Co. directed by the master of Graphic Novels Frank Miller, Sin City is a monochrome masterpiece, with some of the finest visuals, and violent storylines ever created.
3614;Sin City is a hyperstylized piece of greatness.
3615;Co. directed by Rodriguez and Miller, the film is action packed, highly stylized, and very riveting.
3616;It's also an anthology movie!
3617;The first story focusing on Marv is definitely the best, but everything is great in this flick.
3618;This film however is easily Rodriguez's best work.
3619;It's completely appropriate because it blends with the film's style so well.
3620;the Blu Ray looks amazing too.
3621;I got this for $5 on Black Friday and would definitely say it is a must own for any Blu Ray collector!
3622;I put this movie off for nearly a decade and am happy to say I have finally seen it.
3623;I look forward to the sequel and the TV series as well!
3624;Great acting and solid directing.
3625;time favorite action heroes in it: Bruce Willis.
3626;if you liked movies like Bully and Kill Bill, you'll most likely enjoy this film.
3627;Rourke's performance was incredible, but Willis and others also pull off great work.
3628;This movie is Art .
3629;I am having directing and acting classes in the university of Rome for 3 years and all i can tell is that this movie is one of the best ever made .
3630;Perfect black and white shot with great use of technicolor and and color shot spits .
3631;The acting is breathtaking and the story represents perfect the society in which we live today .
3632;It has messeges of fenism , because it shows how can women be strong in such situations .
3633;The (mainly)jazz music fits perfect and the movie is also full of tarantino .
3634;All the actors have done great job , and they fit perfect to they role .
3635;The use of black and white stood out with incredible contrast.
3636;social, but it will give them higher standards.
