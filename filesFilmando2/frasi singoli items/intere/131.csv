3;This is a movie that at some time should have been awarded and honored.
4;This film is one of the most important ones ever made over the past 30 years.
5;It depicts life in a Turkish jail very well (its based on the true story of an American citizen who served time in a Turkish Jail) and is by and large very accurate.

11;This is a brilliant story based on actual events that occurred in Turkey.
12;Brutal torture and barbaric brutalization of people in Turkey is a fact of life and this film does a fantastic job in dramatizing them.
13;What we see in the film are real, actual events that happen to both Turks and non.

15;Brought to life a true story about as well as can be done.
16;when considering the cast for this movie a perfect plan had to have been followed.
17;This biography is a true story about a young American who gets caught in Turkey (right before he boards the plane to go home) smuggling drugs.
18;The film , just taken as a movie is great itself.
19;If you are going to make film based on a true story , you must do it properly first!
20;This is a fantastic movie.
21;I remember seeing it when it came out in the 70's and it is every bit as good now as it was then.
22;He gets caught smuggling drugs and the story from that moment on is unbelievable, intense.

26;nominated for Six Academy Awards and winner for best Adapted Screenplay and Best Score.
27;MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is powerfully directed by Alan Parker, who inspires searing performances from Brad Davis, John Hurt and Randy Quaid.
28;It is an unforgettable look at one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and one mans fight to get home.
29;"the strength of Stone's screenplay and Parker's direction is in its portrayal of Hayes' slow, steady descent into real madness
30;There's no denying how unnerving the customs sequence is to watch"
31;"The direction is particularly compact during a nervy escape attempt
32;synth score to win an Oscar), the dread.
33;the performances are interesting, if not altogether successful.
34;Brad Davis' performance mostly works and he does the turn from in.
35;But for the most part, he is a fine anchor for this graphic, vivid, forceful film.
36;Midnight Express makes its high.
37;It looks quite good, especially for a film that's thirty.
38;But within its limited saturation, the colours are rich and full and the same goes for the black levels, a considerable feat in a film this dark (a closing shot, in which Hayes emerges from a dense swath of darkness, is particularly notable, as is a wonderful silhouette shot of Hurt smoking and calling out for his cat).
39;With no compression artefacts, edge enhancement, this is about as good a presentation as we could hope for.
40;The essay is so thorough, in fact, that it covers pretty much all of the information repeated in the documentary on the disc.
41;audio Commentary In addition to the essay, Parker delivers a cogent talk in which he reminisces about the production.
42;the Producers [26:00] Part 1 of the documentary features interviews with producers Peter Guber and David Puttnam.
43;the Making of Midnight Express [7:27] A grainy, wonderful vintage full.
44;finally, superbly crafted and emotionally involving, Midnight Express often defeats the moral quagmire as presented in the film and the controversial aspects of its script through sheer movie making brilliance.
45;smuggling character into a sympathetic figure due to his disdainful treatment in a hellish foreign prison and taking liberties with a true story for dramatic and artistic.
46;Midnight Express certainly deserves the accolades bestowed upon it by its Academy Awards, though the subject matter and controversial depiction thereof makes it a rather unique film in the annals of cinema.

50;Reading some of these previous reviews is quite interesting in that in some of the critiques there is so much speculation as to what really happened to Billy Hayes in Turkey and what's a product of the Hollywood movie/money making machine.
51;All I want to do is review this movie based on,well, the movie itself.
52;the movie was very suspenseful right from the get go.
53;"giorgio Moroder's musical score,while such synthesizer work seems so outdated by today's standards now,adds to the intensity
54;The late Brad Davis was perfectly cast.You see his fine acting in the film as he transforms from a wide.
55;It would be incredible to see Midnight Express re.
56;made with Pitt in the lead role.
57;randy Quaid was also memorable as the hyper and tempestuous cell mate planning the first escape.
58;the cinematography is foreign (pun intended), gritty, grimy and has plenty of shady/sleazy characters from the consolate(actor Bo Hopkins),lawyers, and court system to the other inmates.
59;make this film with Brad Pitt and see what we get.
60;Probably shadings of other characters he's played from the lunatic in 12 Monkeys to what we see now in his latest film The Mexican and other various films.
61;give me credit for the idea if it get's done (yeah, right).
62;It's a 70's movie I wanted quite a bit.
63;I love this movie"
64;"The acting is great
65;Midnight Express certainly takes a lot of liberties with the truth.
66;I have always thought that films of this type should go one of two ways.
67;The story is intense, the pacing is perfect, and the acting superb.
68;Brad Davis was a remarkable talent i had never heard of before i recently discovered this movie.
69;Randy Quaid is also good in the most dramatic role I've seen him play.
70;It is a fine dramatic work which is given even more weight by the fact that it is based on a true story.
71;This is a movie about the strength of the human spirit against great adversity.
72;To see it remastered and with my wife in my arms was priceless.
73;the tale still holds magic today, as it did back in the days.
74;One of my all time favorites.
75;I watched the film on Tv 5 years ago and it was such an incredible night!
76;But it is also true that films just deviate from the truth.
77;so the film is just an adaptation of the truth.
78;And at that time, it was Oliver Stone's and Alan Parker's adaptation and comment.
79;That's why it is very understandable.
80;I don't really see the point what's so wonderful about the film.
81;So if anyone claims this film represents the truth, I recommend them watch tv and see the real Midnight express.
82;I am a Turkish citizen with a great love of cinema.
83;Like many of my Turkish friends, I liked this movie as a film production.
84;All the good film making elements had their good ways into this cult film, such as strong performances, cinematography, music, etc.
85;turkish propoganda, and very successfully used such names.
86;the real story of the film was that Bill Hayes was helped for his escape by an officer in American consulate, who was an old lady, working at the Istanbul consulate.
87;as I said, I liked the film, as a movie, but, I would still criticise the film makers by being tools for such propoganda makers.
88;Apart from these, if you keep this reality in mind while watching, the rest is a very nice film on screen, not a close reality of what you would see in Istanbul.
89;To conclude I think that this is a great movie (technically, actors, music) and it how the human rights can be violated in the world (I readd, not only in Turkey).
90;I remember really liking this film when I saw it as a younger man.
91;It was supposedly cutting edge and """"gritty"""" with a """"based on a true story"""" aspect to it."""
92;the major emotion upon seeing this film in its entirety a second time years later.
93;that being said the film is shot well and the story is capably told.
94;I'd recommend it to someone who hadn't seen it.
95;Really good presentation of the original material .
96;Brings back memories after all those years.
97;Given Hollywood's penchant for changing elements in stories so that they may best come across the screen, I decided, even though the film was based on a true story, to take that with a grain of salt and just watch the film as a film.
98;also appearing are John Hurt (he won best supporting actor for his role), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie from the Vacation movies) and Paul Smith (Bluto, from Robin Williams' Popeye movie).
99;Attempts by his family, his lawyer, and American government officials are for naught as Billy serves his time.
100;eventually he does, returns home, and decides to write a book about his experience, one that becomes a movie one day, adapted for the screen by Oliver Stone.
101;Ultimately, as far as prison films go, this is a gripping, sometimes harsh to view yarn, but not the best one I've ever seen.
102;One of the best, in my opinion, is Papillon (1973), starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, which, oddly enough, is also based on a true story.
103;I've only watched the wide screen format, and while the picture is good, I felt it could have been better, maybe cleaned up a little, giving us a better tone throughout.
104;watch it a couple of times.
105;He was initially sentenced to 5 years.
106;This is Oliver Stone's writing at it's best.
107;brad Davis is phenomenal as Billy Hayes and it's a shame that he couldn't get his own real life together and become the star he should have become.
108;It was quite eerie actually.
109;It looks great for the most part, crisp and clean with very few artifacts and very little edge enhancement, though some of the scenes were very dark, which is probably the way they were originally shot.
110;Kind of like if you were watching this movie in the theater and the projector got hung up for a frame or two.
111;this is a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen it.
112;This movie holds up very well for being over 20 years old and it's still relevant today.
113;You're in *their* System, baby, and that System brooks absolutely no tapdancing bullsh*t artists.
114;And the Turks are onto him: they send out half their army to block him from hopping his plane, and the fun begins.
115;the film is bitter, and very much alive, very real: Brad Davis is even more astounding, in that he very much dissolves into his character, this modern day Montecristo who realizes that penance is just not enough, and seriously.
116;searched, gutted of dignity, deeply ashamed.
117;but for every decade, I can identify one theatrical release that hit me like a freight train, and which in my mind has become a cinematic monument.
118;i have read the reviews, and a good many of them deal with political issues, and whether the film is faithful to the facts.
119;various reviewers have praised the gritty cinematography, the Oscar.
120;caliber acting, the riveting storyline, the Moroder score, and other aspects of this film.
121;To my mind, a masterpiece is born when every element of the filmmaker's art converges perfectly to create a rare cinematic experience.
122;For me, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is still the number one cinematic masterpiece of the 1970s.
123;This is a very personal appreciation, but I'm sure that any serious film student who is able to objectively analyze the film within the exclusive context of cinematic art would have to conclude that MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a true masterpiece.
124;films that thoroughly satisfy are BONNE and CLYDE, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, BETTY BLUE, BASIC INSTINCT, and CHICAGO, and they all achieve masterpiece status in my pantheon.
125;But these are the films, one per decade, that I've placed highest on my altar.
126;i highly recommend this film to the objective viewer.
127;In fact, in every way that a film can, this one will haunt you for life.
128;This is a true movie and keeps you glued to every scene.
129;Wonderful acting and a movie you will want to watch many times.

148;"ray release of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is the definitive version to own!"

150;The film features some great performances, particularly from Brad Davis and John Hurt, a taut and well.

152;One of my all time favorite movies, and I am a BIG movie person.
153;This was a very good movie to see, even though it was made some time ago.
154;April 23, 2000As you know, Alan Parker is a director and Midnight Express, won two Academy Awards in 1978, was directed by him.
155;He said that this movie was his most effective movie.
156;Sure, it directed by Alan Parker and written by Oliver Stone.
157;Billy Hayes displays true courage and strength under unbearable circumstances.
158;My guy loves this movie, though.
159;This is a well acted based on a true story that is exciting, as well as informative.
160;I just got done watching this movie.
161;Well, on the one hand, I have to admit that it was very well done.
162;The acting was believable and convincing, the settings LOOKED like Turkey (I know, I've been there) and the soundtrack was pretty good.
163;In my opinion, he broke the law, therefore he got what he deserved.
164;"Turks are indeed hospitable (thanks for all the ""tourist tea""!)"
165;A couple of the scenes are absolutely not for the faint of heart, and I can now understand why I was not allowed to watch the film on cable when I was nine years old.
166;Midnight Express is a Seventies classic.
167;"it was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, and its soundtrack produced a Top 40 hit, Giorgio Moroder's ""Chase."""
168;Midnight Express is a searing examination of the depths to which man can fall but also of the tremendous inner resources that some possess in the face of extremity.
169;I heard from friends about how good this movie is, and it does justice from what i've heard, it's even better than i thought.
170;I first saw this powerful movie when I was 17yrs and it has always stuck in my memory.
171;What carries the movie is the incredible acting and also with John Hurt excellently cast as way too sensitive for his enviroment role (with a 'here kitty kitty' scene strangely reminiscent of 'Alien')This is a truly must.
172;Even though this movie is some years ago I still find it relevent today.
173;watch this movie the best way to open your eyes of how horrific things are in those jails.
174;&how it will change you bit by bit.
175;This movie is a real masterpiece, dedicated to the human will.
176;Our hero at the end of the story succeeds in escaping after an endless suffering.
177;The film is, totally, an excellent result.
178;Brad Davis (Billy Hays) has the best role of his short life (he died some years before of AIDS).
179;Alan Parker's direction and Oliver Stone's script are unique as well as the soundtrack created by Giorgio Moroder (who composed many other great soundtracks, including the one of Electric Dreams).
180;The whole movie is very touching and I suggest it to everyone, even to Turks because I believe it could be a good lesson for them.
181;"This is a great movie
182;Parker has created a movie so schockingly realistic and brutal that leaves the viewer speachless .

188;He did, actually, work steadily until shortly before his death.
189;eluded him, despite his talent and appeal.
190;It's a very canny cinematic set.
191;And a point that can be legitimately debated.
192;Back in the 60s and 70s, there was a good deal of """"that."""
193;This is one of the most important movies ever made, in my opinion.
194;I can understand that the Turks don't like this movie, but I myself think it's a masterpiece.
195;This is an absorbing and arresting film.
196;Since the first minute of the opening sequence , the dramatic mood will live in our heart .
197;magnificent script and extraordinary performances.
198;Good thing the Constitution lets us Americans own guns!
199;being of the United States of America, China is full of men with braids, and Georgia is the state that grows delicious peaches, then you're in luck, this movie has all your values!
200;the acting was superb, soundtrack above the standards for it's time and the plot,totally striking.
201;was a good story nonetheless.

204;buttered popcorn in one hand, and the flag in the other.
205;I followed many of his later efforts on the strength of this film.
206;It's both brutally real and hallucinatory at the same time.
207;"There's a feeling of relief at the end of this movie like no other ""prison escape"" movie."
208;The film is also notable as being one of Oliver Stone's early efforts as a screenwriter.
209;There are few more extras on this edition so it's a worthy upgrade and a definite must have if one is looking for a film that's an insight to the time, the cultures and even some perspective on where we are now.
210;Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison.
211;The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns.
212;I've seen this movie many years ago, and I watched it last night again.
213;it is a true story, all right.
214;There are a lot of movies based on true stories in which the moral is all wrong.
215;Time is passing and things change.
216;And hopefully it will be a member soon.3.
217;see the movie if you want, it is a good movie.
218;I had seen the movie several years ago and still think it is very good.
219;"I read Billy Hayes original book accounting his true life experiences in Turkey
220;professed positive homosexual experiences while in prison.
221;Regardless, the film is powerful and has visually stunning cinematography, something that is lacking in today's films.
222;This is one of those films you show friends who have never seen it or heard of it.
223;It is a remarkable film achievement.
224;It's one of the top films of the 1970s.
225;and in the decade of """"The Deer Hunter,"""" """"Jaws,"""" """"Star Wars,"""" """"The Exorcist,"""" and """"The Godfather,"""" just to name a few, that's saying a lot!"""
226;"the ""spoiled"" guy got what he deserved."
227;And will continue until everyone takes the issue seriously and never makes excuses for it.
228;The acting is great, the mood is set just right, and it had me glued from start to finish.
229;Otherwise the film is great and I'm glad I've got it.
230;He's terrific in the role.
231;"I have always been a big fan of ""Based on true stories films"" so I saw this with an opened mind."
232;The script is written by Oliver Stone and Alan Parker's directing is excellent.
233;i really recommend reading the book as it is an actual account of what happened to Hayes but I recommend also watching the film purely to see great film.
234;The book I recommend for those who want to get an actual knowledge of what really happened.
235;Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has announced a 30th Anniversary of Midnight Express which stars Brad Davis, Bo Hopkins, Randy Quaid, and John Hurt.
236;This two time Academy Award winner will be available to own from the 5th February, and should retail at around $19.94.
237;It's better to watch it than to be caught.
238;It really made an impression on me as a young person.
239;"I read Midnight Express and loved it
240;billy's girlfriend Susan, who joins him in a half.
241;A year or so later she was to come into her element fully as Rose Elliot in Argento's masterful INFERNO, but here she is more subdued, though still ravishingly beautiful.
242;She and Brad Davis have got to be the hottest couple ever put on film.
243;Giorgio Moroder, whose soundtrack is one of the epochal moments of 1970s cinema, wrote a beautiful love theme for Billy and Susan, it is tender and filled with longing and frustration.
244;Maybe that's the lure of the movie, to suck you in telling you this is a true story and thus letting your moral judgments get go off the hook.
245;John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.
246;another sunday afternoon movie, curl up on the couch with a bag of chips and dig in visually on the film and dig into the bag of chips with your hands!and brad is stimulating, good looking man!

249;ray has managed to hold its value well.
250;Mostly based on a true story.
251;I always loved this movie and now the my son is older he was able to watched it, and he loved as well, is powerful.
252;Is a great addition to my collection.
253;Watch this movie and it will make you think twice about doing anything like the young man in the movie did, which is based on a real story !!!!!
254;the one part of the film I thought was most thought provoking was WilliamHaye's statement after he found that he had been sentenced to thirty.
255;stumbled on some good acid"
256;"Nevertheless, his ""postmodern"" arguement of moral relativism is still with us today."
257;But I have to say, the film brings it on home like few other documentary films do on any subject.
258;The best way to fight this type of systematic cultural deceit and dehumanisation is with counter.
259;He kept his hope alive by thinking of the 'Midnight Express'.
260;the performances are riveting, the dialogue convincing, the action and pace just right.
261;he got nailed and the story will have you glued from there on.

264;this was a gripping story of the real deal{THEN},if you get into trouble transporting drugs overseas.
265;the famliy notion in the film as touching as his father tried.
266;a stunning performance by Brad Davis and his determination along with the struggle within was as good as it gets.
267;its one i rewatch from time to time!
268;it is a well done film but I have a difficult time feeling sympathy for the main character.
269;Midnight express is (by any standard) spectacular.
270;Hard to accept, but all we get out of the speakers, is a strait Mono track, in a movie which offers one of the best in music originality.
271;Each time I am amazed by the movie's intensity and attention to detail.
272;Brad Davis gave an outstanding performance and could have had a stellar career had he followed this with a few more equally compelling roles.
273;John Hurt put in, what I feel was an award winning performance.
274;This is one of those movie definitely worth watching a few times.
275;I definitely recommend this movie.
276;It's one of the best ones I've ever seen.
277;watch this as you watch Shawshank Redemption.
278;Well, anyways, enjoy the ride!
279;I can't understand how so many people think this is such a great movie.
280;"when I first saw it, having read and enjoyed the bookMidnight Express, I waited for the incredibly exciting escape, and then went ""Huh??"""

294;Midnight Express is, in it's best moments, a stunningly wonderful celebration of the human spirit of love AND of the imperative toward freedom and justice that is at the very core of human be.
295;It is *those* moments in the film (and in life!

297;Very intense movie, wouldn't recommend for someone who is light hearted.
298;Very cool, though, that it was a true story.
299;The movie is entertaining and quite well done.
300;This movie is an old classic.
301;On the plus side: great locations (Instanbul and Malta), beautiful photography, and good acting, help create a sense of atmosphere.

307;i rate this move 4.8/5.0.
