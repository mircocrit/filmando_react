1;major stars and production values in an adult story set in tumultuous times.
2;And, one man's struggle to come to terms with his course in life, his beliefs, his awakening to the nature of power, war, and a developing love for his woman, and their future.
3;And it is about lots more .
4;all worth the telling and the filming.
5;The Special Features are most excellent in the material that goes over the history of the characters times and the filming of the movie.
6;this is a film you will watch more than once.
7;This was an epic movie.
8;Filled with a lot of action towards the end with twists along the way.
9;It keeps you entertained and interested I loved it.
10;One can't help but come away a bit contemplative about what the world would be like if extremists in all religions adopted a more reasonable tone of coexistence.
11;This video set was one our son wanted.
12;After seeing this full release the movie makes much more sense and flows from scene to scene with purpose and direction.
13;If you like the original release I recommend you seeing this.
14;If you are a viewer who has patience and maturity to appreciate a director's cut like this, this will be one of your all time favorites.
15;It goes into tremendous detail and, to be honest, it does embellish a bit excessively.
16;However to compare it to the original release, which i have now given away, it is far superior and to any fan of the theatrical version it is a MUST see and MUST own.
17;It is a true classic.
18;A must have for a true cinematic fan.
19;This movie was good as the theatrical cut, but even better as the director's edition!
20;I have loved all of Ridley Scott's films.
21;He has always had a knack for putting together gripping action films with a good story.
22;he set out to tell a grand story about a turbulent time in history (The Crusades) and he accomplished it.
23;He lacks screen presence, in my opinion, to pull off a lead role in a epic film.
24;This will give you the film Ridley Scott intended.
25;Kingdom of Heaven is certainly the most underrated film I've seen in a very long time.
26;It's so poignant for know as far as the religious fanaticism on both sides.
27;ridley Scott is a genius film maker.
28;Instead, he gives us only what we think we want and then shows us more, like all smart directors.
29;he's got an exceptional script to work with, although it's not without it's flaws.
30;The most notable is the relationship between Balian and Sybylla.
31;He's still, at that point, afraid of that measure of responsibility.
32;Jeremy Irons was the treat I was looking forward to.
33;A gruff voice with a realistic approach, he played him as a man frustrated at his position.
34;He loved and respected his king and knew that when he died, so did Jerusalem.
35;David Thewlis, in another wonderful character role, has the best speech in the film.
36;A wise voice when Balian needs it.
37;the filmmaking is also flawless.
38;There are shots in this movie I've always wanted to see, the best one being at the start of the battle of Jerusalem when the trebuchets start releasing their balistas.
39;You see them off in the horizon and you really feel their coming toward you.
40;There are fanatics on either side that push both sides in the wrong direction.
41;This film brilliantly shows that.
42;This movie, despite what some say, is historically accurate.
43;The action is intense and Orlando does a great job in his traditional .
44;The animation/CG is excellent and the acting is overall very good.
45;Good musical score as well, but the story does tend to lag a little in parts.
46;if you liked Gladiator and Lord of the Rings, mixed with a little bit of history, you'll love this one.
47;"Yes, it was ""dramatized"", yes, much ""license"" was taken with the characters responses to events, nobody Christian, Muslim, or Jew was ever that benevolent, thoughtful, or altruistic."
48;But Baldwin and Saladin did exist and the peace they held in Jerusalem was real.
49;This is one of Ridley Scott's best films, and one of my all.
50;The photography in this film is just gorgeous, the score is one you'll hear in your head for days, and the story really takes you in.
51;It ranks with some of the finest music ever written for the screen.
52;Eva Green is the mesmerizing Christian Queen of Jerusalem.
53;Together with the brilliant cinematography, the film is a visual treat for the senses whatever one may think of the story.
54;I am extremely confident that it will be at least 10 times better than the origianl version (and it wasnt that bad).
55;It is long, but it gives you the rest of the story that you left the box office wanting.
56;hand action rather than siege combat, but this was a fine Crusade.
57;I have seen both versions of this film several times, and I will say that the Director's Cut is far superior to the Theatrical Cut.
58;christian: as far as Hollywood is capable, I felt that this was fair to both sides of the debate, without offering what I might consider serious revisionist problems.
59;It correctly established that Jerusalem was brutalized by both sides, Christians when they first re.
60;"For a complete discussion of the differences between the film and history, you would need to consult a website or book on the subject
61;crafted, the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, and the plot well.
62;I feel that this film will provide one with a new take on the Middle East and the fluid, often subtle struggles that occur between the three religions in Jerusalem.
63;This film also encouraged a resurge of my interest in the Crusades, which is a worthy result of such a well.
64;if you choose to see this film, this is the version you should see.
65;i saw the movie and like it so much that I bought in 2005 the sound track!
66;Was great had a lot of bonus material.
67;Defiantly worth getting if you enjoyed the movie in theaters.
68;One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels .
69;as an action packed medieval adventure/romance .
70;and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.
71;My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:""""God will understand, my lord."""
72;it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format.
73;With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.
74;Simply put this film is one of the best.
75;The acting, the filming, the music is incredible.
76;It was the perfect gift for my grandson who is interested in the Knights Templar.
77;There are wonderful plot elements and sub.
78;plots that didn't make it to the theaters that make this a much more rich experience.
79;It even converted a friend that didn't like it originally but love the director's cut.
80;I truly enjoyed watching this movie and was inspired to read more about the history of the crusades.
81;"if you are inspired to learn more about the crusades and read about the characters in the movie, I recommend the book ""Warriors of God"" from James Reston Jr. enjoy and have fun!!!"
82;The director took a film that was good/ok theatrically and made it into one of my favorite films.
83;This cut adds to the plot and many characters.
84;These details add layers upon a film that was found wanting leaving a fill that is quite compelling.
85;A very enjoyable and entertaining film about the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem.
86;Strong performances setagainst beautiful backdrops.
87;Story line is well done, and the viewer is swept along with a sense ofurgency and doom.
88;disc Director's Cut was worth the wait!
89;The movie is a much better watch now with the scenes which were removed now restored.
90;all the extras are excellent as well.
91;documentaries on all the costumes, sets, props, the rehearsal process, everything.
92;That said the extended director's cut is simply amazing.
93;It makes my list of my favorite films of all time and is definately my favorite Ridley Scott flick, while originally it was my least favorite one.
94;I have to say I loved the Directors Cut.
95;The missing hour's worth of footage adds so much more depth to the story and characters and makes a good movie into a great one.
96;I was pleasantly surprised that in the movie, with the exception of her affair with Balian, from what I have read they stuck to her actual history.
97;Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, a prime example of that.
98;This is the best presentation of the Crusades I have ever seen.
99;The films also does an admirable job of presenting the Crusades in as even.
100;handed a manner as possible.
101;I would say this film does the best job of presenting both the good and the bad qualities of both sides, and leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions.
102;At it's heart the film is very anti.
103;the cast of this film is excellent.
104;"This is the best work I've seen out of Orlando Bloom
105;This film is epic in the finest sense of the word and deserved far more attention than it received at thebox office.
106;The Muslims are portrayed as noble, principled and physically clean, the Christians are portrayed as base, unprincipled and filthy.
107;The King of Jerusalem is a leper, symbolizing the corrupt nature of Christian rule and the one high ranking Christian prelate we see is an officious coward.
108;When Saladin's polished, very orderly army appears, beautiful flags waving in the wind, it is a stirring sight.
109;Unscrupulous Christian knights scheme against the King, each other and the peace, while Muslim leaders exude honor.
110;Orlando Bloom's love interest, Sybilla, the Queen of Jerusalem, is a slut who causes a war because of pique.
111;after days of fighting Saladin takes Jerusalem and magnanimously grants the survivors safe passage out of the Holy Land.
112;i gave this picture one star for its great cinematography and soundtrack.
113;the story is dramatized, and Scott and his writers made liberal use of dramatic license.
114;so much so that he was revered as a chivalric ideal throughout most of Christian Europe, despite being a Muslim.
115;The Hospitaller, played by David Thewlis is also a good man, and a man of faith.
116;He is a member of a religious military order, is Godfrey's confessor, and states at one point that he believes Christ would not order men to commit the crimes that the Pope is ordering them to commit.
117;I am a firm believer that the best film is the one that is released in theaters.
118;Exceptions to this rule are rare, but when I find them, they are generally fantastic.
119;i was most pleased with the extra time with Godfrey.
120;Mix in just a dab of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish conflict.
121;Wrap the whole mixture in a 2 disc package crammed full of educational features, and what do you get?
122;The message of the movie is very simple :Despite wars having taken place, despite excess having been committed and blood spelled unnecessarily, there is still plenty of room for peace and mutual respect between christians and muslims, providing one is interested in """"genuine peace"""" as opposed to """"tactical peace""""."""
123;are you brave enough to leave the beaten path ?
124;What a great expression of respect.
125;I guarantee to you that as much as you'll have a great deal of entertainment, you'll get also something else that would change the world.
126;I absolutely loved this movie, although the cuts to make the movie fit into a 2.
127;The first time I saw it, I definitely felt something was missing.
128;if you think you MIGHT like the movie, you absolutely should watch it.
129;This is one of the greatest films on a grand scale since the likes of 1492.
130;kingdom of Heaven is one of the great Films of the 2000's.
131;I liked this film in the theater.
132;Overall I thought it was enjoyable, but I would REALLY like to see the rumored longer directer's cut of the film.
133;disc director's cut I can unequivocally recommend that version.
134;din beheads Reynald, which is considered more historically accurate.
135;to add benefits to this set is a vast collection of documentaries focused on all aspects of making the film from pre.
136;production, working with actors from well.
137;What is new here is that finally the film flows and takes the time it needs to tell the story.
138;this time around, characters are introduced with more depth and the tensions are being let grow(as if they have been set free, terrific!)
139;sure, it is part fiction, part truth, but a commercial movie cannot depend on history alone.
140;in Kingdom of Heaven Ridley uses filmmaterial, color, setting, simply everything to paint a perfect picture (sometimes, I think, to a greater extent and with better results than in his other movies).
141;on top of that comes a story with characters that stay with you for days, weeks, months even.
142;Love and honor, loyalty and faith .
143;The restored and extended scenes in this version of Kingdom of Heaven make it a totally new experience.
144;while the Extended Versions of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy are superior versions of very good, theatrically released films, the Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut is vastly superior to its theatrical version.
145;I also like cinematic battle scenes.
146;So the fact that Ridley Scott was going to produce an epic about the Crusades had me frothing at the mouth in anticipation.
147;"The skinny on this film is that the Christians (or at least the believers) are bad and the Muslims and the ""secularists"" are noble."
148;Kingdom of Heaven is a decent crusade film.
149;It's grounded just enough in reality to keep me happy, but changes enough to keep me interested, and the changes made are somewhat understandable.
150;This is an excellent movie, well.
151;Many interesting twists in the storyline, which, believe it or not, are mostly true.
152;The dramatic presentation of the story is well done and draws you in even if you do not want to be drawn, and gets you rooting for the good guys, if you can decide who they are???
153;and one of Sir Ridley's best films.
154;For 10$, this is a steal!
155;The battle sequences are among the best filmed.
156;it is an informative historic movie.
157;eva green ,bloom, the invader all played their part great
158;but I find myself wanting to go back and see more of his work after this.
159;the first thing I have to mention is Edward Norton's portrayal of King Baldwin IV.
160;He's got the perfect mixture of nobility, inner strength and wisdom, youth and fatigue brought on by his illness.
161;Besides that, he's visually striking.
162;The voice Norton gives him is sweet and a little reedy.
163;He only has six scenes, and I greatly hope that the Director's Cut includes some more on Baldwin.
164;i'm also impressed with Orlando Bloom's performance.
165;He's very good in his battle scenes as well.
166;David Thewlis, one of my favorites, plays a very compelling warrior priest, the Hospitaller, who believes that right action is more important than religion.
167;Jeremy Irons is great as a good guy for a change, a war.
168;Far from being your typical Hollywood leader of the bad guys, he's shown as wise and compassionate, a match for the Christian King Baldwin.
169;The visually lush settings, splendid cinematography (the scene on Calvary Hill is luminous with stars, the battles scene with the horsemen is stirring and terrifying) the production is a treat for eyes, ears, and mind.
170;It's not just that Orlando Bloom is so good looking, I love the fact that this story seems to be an objective telling of a war for Jerusalem where both sides do good, both sides do bad, and in the end, each side retains their humanity and honor.
171;This is the third best movie I've ever seen (after LoTR and Batman).
172;I just watched this for the first time but went with the Director's Cut as I read it made an immense difference compared to the original cut.
173;The movie industry has been well.
174;this is a great movie for those who love world history or for those who love epics (like me).
175;One of my top 5 favorite movies.
176;I just love everything about it.
177;I am happy to add this to my Blu.
178;of the DC divulges many important facts and wonderful scenes.
179;"The combat sequences incorporate the most vivid of Scott's trademark cinemaviolence, and this, along with the ""Can't We All Just Get."
180;I can explain everything about these assertions and defend the movie from them, and show them that they are not only justifiable, but also necessary in order to EXONERATE THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
181;The value of the movie is in separation of Christian principles from the non.
182;"view of the Christians who aren't murderers but soldiers in protection of all white Westerners of Israel, and they defend Christian civilians who cannot fight for themselves
183;This protection is perfectly in line with Christian faith and Christian principles.
184;Attitudes determine the true character of the Christians and Muslims and why the superior.
185;east"
186;Anyone who says so is painting an inacurate picture based on their own culpabilities and not the culpabilities of the truly patriotic, nor the truly Christian.
187;this is a very good movie, an epic that rivals the scale and greatness of Lord Of the Rings: Return Of the King.
188;dressing and props covering a 360.
189;Otherwise, the film had better box office sales in foreign countries and they all felt great about the film, of particular noteworthiness were today's Mid.
190;east Muslims who seemed to appreciate the film's responsible tale as reflective of the greatness of Western culture and principles: of special note are the multi.
191;They write like their hearts and minds liked the movie and felt compelled to give a lacking star.
192;Aside from that, the special features are about the fun had by the multi.
193;national cast and crew while making Kingdom Of Heaven, and they are just as fun to watch as the movie was to make.
194;"hour road show version with entrance music and intermission, it is perfectly enjoyable, and this ""Director's Cut"" version is better than the theatrical release."
195;sir Ridley Scott is one of the top five biggest directors alive today, which is why he received an English knight.
196;"His films include ""The Deulists,"" ""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""1492: Conquest for Paradise,"" ""G. i. Jane,"" ""Thelma and Louise,"" and ""Hannibal."""
197;These are all great films in their own right.
198;The films he directed for the cinema have the greatest ratio of theater.
199;His record is a remarkable one, and his successes are not limited to popularity.
200;He receives a lot of recognition as an artist.
201;His talent as a former cinematographer and art director shows in spades in this film.
202;The color palette changes from the cool, almost black and white scenes in France to the blistering earth tones of the scenes in the Middle East.
203;the cast did an admirable job in getting lost in their roles.
204;Massoud has presence and is actually one of the few characters who seemed to go beyond the petty, religious politicking this film has piles of.
205;He makes a convincing enough knight, but never as the protector of Jerusalem.
206;but most people will come to see Kingdom of Heaven for its many battle set pieces.
207;As a military history buff I'm usually more critical of epic films depicting historical battles on film.
208;the film succeeds well enough in recreating the fight for Jerusalem and the politics involved from all sides.
209;The acting is very good overall though a few casting choices could've been made better.
210;Appearantly the old man wants to bond with his bastard son, and Bailin finds himself following his dad to the Holy Land.
211;"Adventure and war ensues
212;It's funny that Bloom is being hailed as the modern day Errol Flynn.
213;For my money, he'd be wise to watch some of Flynn's films to see what charisma looks like.
214;Kingdom Of Heaven bends over backwards to show us how wonderful Saladin and his Muslim warriors were, but by doing that, the film lacks real conflict.
215;having said that, I have all the respect in the world for Ridley Scott's direction.
216;There are beautiful moments in the film"
217;editing existing art, in this case the second.
218;guessing is both justified and well worth the effort.
219;The Director's cut of Kingdom Of Heaven is so much better than the theatrical cut, it basically represents another film altogether.
220;hour version is thoughtful, exciting and genuinely epic.
221;"Of course, the real star here is Ridley Scott and his amazing visual style and attention to period detail
222;Kingdom Of Heaven, in this new version, is a film that engulfs you in it's beauty and majesty and demands to be re.
223;catholic extreme in this film.
224;But there were also priests of conscience, peace.
225;loving monks and competent bishops.
226;You can basically rest assured that anytime a Hollywood director sets his eyes on the Crusades, the story will be told from an anachronistic, anti.
227;what would you call those little military excursions into the historically Christian, and ethnically non.
228;If you love crusader/midevil movies youll like this one.
229;Its done very well, good story and good pacing.
230;While it is """"hollywood"""", there is enough historical fact and genuine character development to keep it from being just another battle."""
231;"The romance, while a bit fanciful, added an interesting spark to please ""everyone""."
232;i say watch it and enjoy.
233;It is a very entertaining movie with some excellent acting and a few grains of historical fact.
234;This version is absolutely amazing.
235;I was so please to be able to order it on line.
236;It was for a Christmas gift request.
237;The subject matter is great.
238;The action is very good.
239;But if you own a regular movie, keep it.
240;That aside, the rest of the movie is spectacular.
241;He's sure to top it next time around.
242;ray family, this movie will make you proud.
243;ray movie tranfers are amazing due to which studio is doing the transfers.
244;ray movies look the best hands down!
245;And this movie is by that studio.
246;The theme was redemption, honor and purity of the heart and as such pointing out everything bad about another culture wasn't necessary.
247;In this way this movie is very personal to me.
248;For the record, the director's cut is substantially longer and makes better use of the characters.
249;There is a particularly good piece on mideivel castles on the original 2 disc version that is well worth watching, but it doesn't seem to be on the Director's cut.
250;ray, I jumped on it, thank you.
251;"Despite a few ""ripped from today's headlines"" speeches, the action is well."
252;done, the military conflict interesting and there are strong performances all around.
253;The climactic battle at the Christopher Gate of Jerusalem, if it doesn't quite measure up to similar siege sequences in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, is exciting and involving, even if the populism seems a few centuries early.
254;great fun with a more rounded story than the more intense Gladiator.
255;strongly recommended for fans of getting medieval.
256;The topic and the morals this movies have may be contridictory in the religious aspects.
257;But overall, the movie was powerful, the characters well defined, and human virtues and faults are revealed.
258;"up to ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", is, certainly, the best film about the Crusades ever made."
259;While this may seem faint praise about an era far removed from ours, his vision offers an honesty and timeliness that clearly illustrates how little has changed in the last thousand years.
260;while there are many historical inaccuracies, for cinematic purposes (Godfrey and Balian were not related, Balian did not have a love affair with Sibylla, etc.), director Scott unflinchingly shows much that was true (Jerusalem's 'King' Baldwin.
261;"several performances deserve mention
262;disc set that certainly lives up to expectations!
263;Any Ridley Scott film is worth owning.
264;Kingdom of Heaven stands as one of his best, so need I say more?
265;The director's cut, while still not a perfect movie, has made up for many of those problems: It gives more substance to the characters of Balian and Sibylla, and in doing so it gives both a more vivid and somewhat more accurate portrait of what life was really like nearly 1000 years ago.
266;All the rest of the actors are absolutely fantastic: Liam Neeson is once again at his grumbly, father.
267;If you liked the original, you will love the Director's Cut.
268;ray, director's cut of this film because I just love it.
269;ray looks great and I just can't say enough about this film, it's one of the best.
270;I particularly enjoyed the commentary from the director, writer and lead actor.
271;It arrived quickly and has given him great enjoyment.
272;Excellent performances from great actors and a noble and uplifting story make this an exceptional movie.
273;Of course, it can be a little anachronistic,but it makes for a higher type of entertainment nevertheless.
274;In its public version, it is a fairly good movie, well.
275;What she, as a mother, is willing to do and does for her son, that is what makes her an equal match for the blacksmith defender of Jerusalem, so well.
276;It's what makes this, in my opinion, not just a fairly good movie but a great movie.
277;ray which is directors cut, you will enjoy it.
278;The movie takes you back to the dark ages of Christianity.
279;We think of ourselves as civilized now, and it is fascinating to watch how little humanity has changed: passions, love, power, greed.
280;If you're looking for escapist costume entertainment with obvious bias, this is it.
281;Ridley Scott is such a """"great director"""" I can't put into words how disapointed I am in """"Kingdom of Heaven""""!"""
282;"Oddly he does this in what should be well known ""Christian"" history (I speak here of his treatment of the Templers as well many historical figures.)"
283;This effectively muddles the history.
284;"The end result is ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is very pro."
285;in other areas this is a fine film.
286;Scott's seige of the city is especailly well done and effective.
287;"I was greatly suprised (and impressed) to see just how well the movie was able to weave actual events into the fabric of the story (unlike say last years ""King Arthur"")."
288;The characters portayed are also (for the most part) based on real people.
289;"During the coarse of the story we meet a range of characters, some of them are the ""good guys"" and some are not."
290;Between these two groups we have Balian our hero and his incoruptable sense of honor (I had strong identification with this character).
291;"I understand at sometime in the future there will be a ""directors cut"" and I'm sure I will be interested in it,but for the time being I can't wait!"
292;It's a pretty long movie, so if you like epics then you should be pleased with this.
293;So basically, if you want a serious, fairly historically accurate film with lots of fight to death scenes and moral dilemmas then this is a movie worth checking out.
294;I liked the theater version but when I saw the long one I realized the scope of the whole story, and so enjoyed the development of all the characters that I wanted to own it.
295;It's a jewel of a movie, and I loved to learn more about how it was imagined and made.
296;d pop and revealed visual details.
297;bodied man willing and able to carry a sword or shoot a bow.
298;Costumes, the activities of women of the times, the non.
299;Balian digs wells with friends and fellow citizens, travels far and wide, sails around the hub of the world, returns to his blacksmith shop, and we have no idea.
300;Seeing as how so many other people have already done such a good job at doing just that.
301;But I will give you my opinion.
302;This movie is more historically accurate then most hollywood films based on historical events (which is usually accurate on some of the larger things, but not the details).
303;It gave a good impression of the politics that was going on during the Crusades.
304;He did a good portrayal in my opinion.
305;i highly recommend this movie!
306;The main struggle was between Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin.
307;The directors cut is 3 hours long and more complex, but the story was much more enjoyable, and had more depth and believability.
308;She actually tried to keep the peace.
309;If you want to see a good action/adventure/drama type film then this is the one for you.
310;The cinematography, action sequences, and music are great.
311;The movie does offer some interesting philosophical insights or questions that we all probably ask ourselves concerning faith and religion.
312;The characters in the movies and the period it is set during (the second crusade) did exist.
313;They also started the crusades when they invaded Jerusalem and moved in on the Byzantine Empire, murdering any who did not accept Muslim rule.
314;like I said, do not take this movie as an accurate portrayal of history.
315;But make sure you watch the director's cut and not the theatrical version.
316;It gives more insight in the character's lives and back stories explaining more of why they do what they do.
317;"and I graduated with a degree in theology, the ""science"" of religions."
318;This movie should be required viewing for all history students .
319;It also shows how men of TRUE faith and good sense learn to rise above that religion.
320;The acting is wonderful, the costumes excellent and Ridley Scott is a truly great director.
321;But it is fairly accurate.
322;The movie is beautiful and so procative.
323;Now in this time, you watch it and make up your own mind about who is the bad guy.
324;"Tolerance will make a ""better world than we have seen."""
325;This movie in an interesting adventure.
326;It contains some beautiful fight sequences and even has a little bit of a heart to it.
327;In this particular version there are also a lot of interesting extras including a developing documentary and a great featurette with historical information on Jerusalem around the 12th century.
328;"But if you are looking to kill some time, you like ""historical"" epics and great battle scenes then give this one a try."
329;Personally I found the commentaries and extras to be far better than the movie itself.
330;"Is the much anticipated ""The Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)"" worth the extra bucks?"
331;It certainly is if you are an avid fan of Ridley Scott's work, fascinated with the Crusades or appreciate medieval history.
332;although the Director's Cut is now nearly four hours long, it is a much better film in its originally conceived epic form.
333;It is nevertheless visually stunning.
334;Simplistic though it may seem, its strength lies in demonstrating that an everyman like Balian can rise above his own frailties if he so possesses the heart and wisdom to prevail.
335;"When the movie first came out to the theaters, I went to see it for two reasons
336;i thoroughly enjoyed the movie in spite of the historical inaccuracies regarding the characters.
337;I feel it is the definitive film about the Crusades.
338;i found the key to enjoyment of the film is to view it as entertainment, not as a documentary, which the director never intended.
339;Kingdom of Heaven succeeded on that level.
340;all in all, however, I found Kingdom of Heaven to be a highly entertaining historical epic, and I recommend it to any viewers who enjoy this category of film.
341;I've liked this movie for a while.
342;The director's cut is by far the superior version of this film.
343;Director Ridley Scott delivers one of the most gripping character driven epics in recent memory.
344;There is just the right balance between history and dramatization, between action and character development.
345;It is one of the most ambitious projects of it's time and the 45+ extra minutes in the directors cut puts in in the running for best film of that year, and amongst Scott's best works of all time.
346;Now, though, the true picture has been released and boy is it a revelation.
347;The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is one of the best movies you'll ever see.
348;great cast and a brilliant screenplay .
349;It adds so much more to the storyline and makes so much more sense.
350;I had seen the theatrical version many times and loved it but when I saw the directors cut I never went back.
351;It's a great film and has a great message.
352;One of the greatest directors in history (Ridley Scott) does it yet again.
353;liam Neeson is incredible, and most suprisingly of all, Scott makes pretty.
354;boy Orlando Bloom very convincing as a warrior.
355;The story is fascinating and the fights are mind.
356;Good story, interesting characters and a neat ending.
357;I was pleasantly surprised on this movie.
358;For 2 1/2 hours the storyline kept my interest.
359;Actors were excellent and a fairly good storyline.
360;Main battle scenes were well done and the movie moved on without fluff right up to the end.
361;the movie is very interesting to watch, and it has unique things to look at.
362;The first 45 minutes in France are very grim and dreary to such an excess that it is fascinating how they managed to get a new take onscreen of old Europe!
363;life leper King Baldwin, wearing a mysterious yet graceful mask is also a memorable visual.
364;very original to film, yet very accurate to history.
365;He is typecast in my mind as a great supporting actor, such as Legolas in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, or in the PIRATES films with Johnny Depp.
366;I really enjoyed the opening scenes with Liam Neeson.
367;Also, the love interest, Queen of Jerusalem, is played very nicely.
368;This is a great film with stunning visual effects and massive battles.
369;This version provides great commentary and tons of bonus features.
370;It's a major plotline and it completely explains everything she does in the movie.
371;And hers is actually the most moving story arc in the film now.
372;(The priest is actually his BROTHER!
373;It's longer, but it's definitely worth it.
374;Awesome movie, I loved the theatrical cut.
375;Much longer than the original movie.
376;This is an excellent movie with good casting, story, special effects, camera work, music, and sets.
377;If you enjoy movies like Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, Troy, Robin Hood, et cetera you will probably enjoy this movie.
378;A great deal of epic battle scenes, knightly honor, and court intrigue make this well worth a look.
379;Godfrey (Neeson) takes his son with him to the Holy City but on the way he is mortaly wounded in a fight to protect his son.
380;He gives over his possesions to his son and tells him to protect the king and the people.
381;A very interesting historical film that has great special features that tells the history with the movie if you select to do so.
382;It was well done, however a bit confusing to follow who the groups were that were engaged in the epic warfare.
383;Probably have to view it twice to catch all the nuances.
384;if u enjoyed the theatrical, u'll LOVE the director's cut .
385;If you're into historical and religious epics, which I am, this is a really good movie in spite of having a major amount of time/details cut from it for the theatrical release.
386;The Director's Cut definitely provides a much higher level of the character and plot development originally envisioned by Ridley Scott which makes the movie all the more gripping.
387;This was everything I hoped it would be, action, love, J. Irons and the story was thrilling.
388;In the end the good guys got the girl and the satisfaction of knowing they had won!!!
389;I love historical films so I was glad the gamble paid off.
390;By no means is it Scott's best work but it is a very good bordering on great movie.
391;The design of the cover and box is really nice, I haven't watched the extras but there's lots to keep you busy if you're fascinated by The Crusades or movie.
392;a good story about giving Jerusalem back to the Muslums.
393;This is a love story.
394;Ok, let me start off by saying that i enjoyed this movie.
395;kingdom of Heaven had tremendous battle scenes and swordplay and was one of the most beautiful shot movies ive ever seen.
396;The colors and environments stood out and looked wonderful.
397;and the pace of this movie, while fast and exciting, didnt give its characters any justice.
398;Bloom leaves his town so fast.
399;Kingdom of Heaven is one of my favorite films.
400;I love the history it portrays.
401;the sets are amazing, the music beautiful, the photography stunning, the costumes fabulous Ridley Scott is such a marvelous director.
402;Also the special comments are so helpful in understanding of the making of this Crusades epic
403;A good one for any collection.
404;He does well with the few lines of script that he has been given.
405;This is a good movie with much to interest those who enjoy history.
406;Ridly Scott really worked to make this as historically accurate as possible and he lets us know (in the great accompanying book) just where he padded a character out to give it more in the movie.
407;I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs.
408;In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non.
409;It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design.
410;The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film.
411;Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran.
412;which is a primary theme of the film.
413;This is actually a good message for our day and time .
414;I had seen an interview with Orlando Bloom who said he enjoyed doing this movie.
415;The main character was well developed some of the other characters much less so.
416;The film was based on historical characters and situations, and the script did a decent job of reducing the historical complexity down to a followable narrative.
417;Costuming was outstanding: it added interest and was colorful.
418;This film gets three stars for only one reason: the costuming was quite good and period.
419;When depicting a religion and culture he doesn't understand, a filmmaker should show respect and sensitivity and strive for accuracy.
420;Even Jeremy Irons, who made such a good Jesuit in """"The Mission"""" and """"The Man in the Iron Mask"""", claims at the end of the movie that God has left him."""
421;But we must remember, it's always Scott and his screenwriter talking.
422;the basic events and names of characters in this movie do bear a reasonable resemblance (allowing for poetic license and the exigencies of storytelling) to real historical events and persons.
423;It is visually impressive and carries a lot of star power, but the contentious apects of its relentless message overwhelm its virtues.
424;Good solid movie with some historical accuracy and a few totally wrong.
425;I show the last battle scene in class every time I can.
426;Orlando bloom isnt the strongest lead but the supporting cast, and smart plot more than make up for it.
427;a masterpiece of acting, dialogue, message, sound, and cinematography.
428;The Director's Cut now shows why she does what she does.
429;It also gives us a little more Baldwin IV, who is by far the most interesting character in the film.
430;And it establishes that Balian and Sibylla have a lot more than a one night stand.
431;(Balian's history is of course invented, other than the fact that there was a Balian who defended Jerusalem as you see in the film and under the circumstances you see in the film.)
432;The final battle is awesome, almost like being there.
433;The Pilgrim's Guide option made it totally understandable, explaining parts, giving background information that otherwise would not have been known.
434;This movie is very good and it has nonstop action.
435;Liam Neeson is also very good for as loing as he is in the flim.
436;The battle in the movie is spectacular.
437;The speech that Orlanddo is a very good speech.
438;I give this movie a thumbs up.
439;Delivery was timely and I still watch it from time to time.
440;I bought this four disc set to satisfy my interest in this Ridley Scott film.
441;Eventually, I will also watch the other background features.
442;This film set exceeded my expectations.
443;"Unlike many ""directors cuts"" which are released primarily to squeeze more money out of the consumer, this version is Scott's vision brought to full glory and it is a must see for anyone who likes either spectacles or just great filmmaking."
444;I won't give away these scenes, but I will leave it be said that the first thirty minutes of the film is a rich and well laid out foundation for what is to follow.
445;it is also worth noting here, that unlike many critics reviews, this film is NOT just an excuse for large scale battle scenes and carnage, but rather a carefully crafted and craftily thought out parable for our own times.
446;Scott is one of only a few master film makers active today, and part of his genius is he understands character, plot, and most of all has an amazingly complete grasp of what makes great cinema.
447;i would rate this film among the great epics ever made, alongside such films as BEN HUR, ZULU, GLADIATOR, and a hand full of others.
448;What separates this film from most other large scale action dramas, is that it contains a complex view of competing religious and moral stands.
449;And, nlike many spectacles, this film uses spectacle to make a salient point about the religious and moral dilemmas of our own time.
450;He uses the venue of an historical epic to illustrate the unending moral upheaval that has marked all of human history, between those who want tolerance, and those whose fanaticism to a moral or religious dogma blinds them and has been the cause of countless deaths and suffering.
451;"that is what makes this film great and also makes it challenging to viewers
452;great films are always parables that intend to illuminate the present through the past.
453;In that sense, Scott has again triumphed in this compelling and complex film.
454;if anyone can watch this film without being moved by it, and made to question one's own views, that one's heart is made of stone.
455;bloom, as Bailon, carried the movie pretty well.
456;It worked mostly because of a great script and great execution.
457;Saladin is a significant historical figure, and I did not know about him until I watched this movie.
458;i really liked the way this movie emphasized the theme of """"honor"""" and """"peace""""."""
459;It sends a great message for our generation.
460;But then, how many perfect movies are there?
461;Looking more like an Aragorn with a sword, Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a great knight in the making in this epic movie.
462;After losing his wife, he is reunited with his father the great knight Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), and so begins his spiritual journey.
463;He passes his sword and the sacred oath to his son: Balian, who vows to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and strive for harmony between religions and cultures.
464;In the process, he finds love, God, and becomes a courageous leader as he defends the Holy City and strives to make a kingdom of heaven thrive here on earth.
465;Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie with an epic length.
466;The acting is good, with many great actors.
467;The plot and costumes are excellent and sets the stage.
468;The battle scenes are choreographed and well shot.
469;I'm no fan of big epics, but Kingdom was a good movie.
470;This movie is great to watch, not only you learn something from the past but mostly portrayed accurately.
471;Very enjoyable and exciting .
472;this is a must to have and will recommend highly to my friends.
473;If you enjoy history, like I do, you will be enthralled by this movie.
474;orlando Bloom does a great job at portraying a heart broken man who becomes a great man.
475;I liked this movie for the obvious reasons, good direction, good acting, and good action.
476;It is more a tale of what true honor is all about, about staying true to your heart and never selling your soul out.
477;This is a message that needs to be integrated into movies, and society itself, more often.
478;This is one of those incredible movies that I want to watch again and again.
479;When the peaceful King Baldwin dies at a young age, it's hoped that the blacksmith son of Knight Godfrey will take the king's place.
480;Directors cuts are usually the best versions of movies and this is true for kingdom of heaven.
481;The story was well rounded with the extra 40+ min.
482;Good historical fiction with enough action to keep my husband engaged.
483;Plenty of big names to peak his interest to watch it.
484;having watched this latest installment by great director Ridley Scott,who is infamous for his movies lasting more than the usual hour and a half.
485;this one clocks in at 2 and a half hours, which I had to stop and start, was a great movie.
486;very great number of battle scenes, but there is a story line in there too.
487;great job by all involved.:)
488;the directors cut of this movie is honestly the only way to go.
489;I went to see this movie very cautiously, because as a Christian and knowing that Ridley Scott is an Atheist worried me.
490;in what was quite possibly one of the best movies of the year, the story of the crusades is put to life on the screen for everyone to see.
491;The settings and landscapes were simply breathtaking, and the cinematography was excellent.
492;the supporting cast, which included Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, and Edward Norton, were amazing.
493;They truly carried the movie.
494;So please, if you have any other questions about Jesus or what he stood for, go to a local church and talk to the pastor there.
495;As a history buff, I found it absolutely fascinating.
496;After viewing it (twice), I did some research and found out more about the actual characters.
497;When approaching this Director's Cut of 'Kingdom of Heaven,' it is important to note that is a completely new experience from the theatrical version.
498;The 144 minute theatrical release was a flawed masterpiece, with large plto holes and a worthy performance by Bloom.
499;minute Director's Cut is an epic masterpiece with extraordinary thematic content and a magnificent perfromance by Bloom.
500;the Director's Cut is presented as a 3.
501;But either way you look at it, he knows just what he is doing.
502;This is just another example, of a Masterpiece .
503;and still make it as good!!!
504;Sorry, on to the film.
505;but seriously, Special Features aside .
506;Certain scenes make perfect sense, with better understanding of how and why (attack on Baelian and Dad in woods prior to Holy Land, relationship between Baelian and Cybilla, etc. etc. etc.)Speaking of.
507;However, you'll usually get great visuals from Ridley Scott's movies and this one has it with some striking cinematography shots of landscapes.
508;wise it's straight across the board with particular attention to Edward Norton as King Baldwin who, like Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, manages to be captivating even when his face is shielded by a mask.
509;And the director's cut puts those scenes back in.
510;it's a pretty good movie.
511;The extended edition of this movie offers so many new scenes.
512;It truly gives important information about certain characters in the movie.
513;the editor's cut for Kingdom of Heaven is an even more informative and entertaining film than the first release.
514;I did not think I would/could enjoy anything more than the first release but was pleasantly surprised.
515;That said, this movie is amazing on blu.
516;Ridley Scott has championed another great epic.
517;It's a great film and looks fantastic on blu.
518;This movie was fantastic on so many levels.
519;The emotion, the action, and all the graphic and realistic make.
520;This is one I will watch over and over.
521;What a great movie this ended up being.
522;Masterfully put together and wonderfully entertaining, this is a movie you will want to watch over and over again.
523;"
524;I really enjoyed the theatrical cut until I saw the Director's cut which was way better.
525;Here Ridley Scott is at his masterful best bringing this epic to life.
526;With this cut the story in my opinion is explained better with the main characters and the added scenes were necessary to understand the story better.
527;Orlando Bloom fits his role as Balian perfectly along with Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Eva Green and Brendan Gleeson.
528;Also a magnificent soundtrack composed by Harry Gregson.
529;william which helps bring feeling to the movie.
530;i highly recommend the Director's cut over the theatrical version with alot more character and background issues are professionally defined in this magnificent epic that shows that Ridley Scott is truly among the best Directors of our time.
531;This director's cut fills out and expands the story, without making it feel a moment longer.
532;the deep, deep cuts in the theatrical film made so many complex political, religious and personal layers in the story and the characters just go away.
533;They are restored in this cut and it is a glorious movie.
534;While the theatrical cut is still a very good movie, this director's cut is a superior movie.
535;This is where Balian's life takes a dramatic turn, and he is drawn into political and personal machinations the likes of which he has never seen before.
536;visually, the movie is stunning and vivid, and the soundtrack is perfect for it.
537;For instance, in a couple of Balian's key speeches, the reaction shots of other characters leave you with the impression something more is coming, and it isn't.
538;It makes those key moments a bit anticlimactic.
539;the acting is superb, and quite honestly, Orlando Bloom has been short.
540;with the fantastic acting across the board, and the story told as it was meant to be, this is a movie worth watching again and again.
541;Speaking of casting, the bits on the extras where we get to see some early rehearsals are fascinating.
542;The screenwriter, Monahan, comes off rather arrogant in places, but he did put together an overall amazing script, so it's forgiveable.
543;It absolutely deserved to be.
544;bloom's acting was fine just simply mis.
545;now the message of the film was very good .
546;indulgant (especially with respect to the fighting scenes) and too characterized by feigned or affected grandeur.
547;i'm really, really hoping that there is a Director's Cut.
548;the theatrical version was a good film.
549;the extened edition is a great film.
550;The drama is better, the romance is better, all of the major characters have more screen time and the pacing is MUCH better.
551;This was a good movie overall and I enjoyed it.
552;The battle scene is great though.
553;the movie is visually stunning, and the extras are very good.
554;Becket with Richard Burton is also available on VHS here at Amazon.
555;Director's Cut is much more indepth, characters more developed.
556;I enjoyed the storyline, and the acting as a whole was decent.
557;The battle scenes as well as the scenery itself was breathtaking and even rivaled those in Troy.
558;Orlando Bloom who I will say is a fine actor handled his role well, or as well as can be expected.
559;Edward Norton as the leper king was a treat.
560;he's a great actor who can tackle anything spendidly.
561;It's a story to be told and thats a great thing.
562;I love epic pictures and this is one I will watch again and one that I am happy was made.
563;It's not like it couldn't have been better, but the point is that it's still really well done.
564;Generally I liked the movie.
565;Good effects, ok story and descent acting.
566;Also, it felt more like a kids movie.
567;Great story, great acting, and great truths to take away even today.
568;For those of you unsure wether Orlando bloom manages to look like he's a good actor.
569;But he really can hold scenes well by the strength of his acting.
570;And this movie proves it.
571;kingdom of heaven is a wonderfully done movie by Ridley Scott (Gladiator) the history is pretty much accurate, and jerusalim is breathtaking.
572;His scenes aren't long, but what he does have shines.
573;For those who have watched Gladiator this is pretty much the same.
574;Besides, its enough just keeping up with the history portrayed in this movie to keep you focused.
575;truly enjoyable, a real feast for the history buff and those that love good movies
576;This is surley the best motion picture by Scott ever!
577;It is a really great epic that is truly so close to what the bible tells us.
578;a great motion picture to say the least.
579;Gladiator fans, look out this is evenj better than that!
580;A masterpiece if there ever was one by Scott!
581;Its so well dont that I had to ask for this forChristmas!
582;Although you never see his face because he always wears masks due to his condition, his physical presence, mannerisms, and vocial performance are what make this movie special.
583;A good comparison of Norton's performance of The Leper King is what Heath Ledger did for the Joker in the Dark Knight, both movies achieve more with these character performances.
584;In this time of religious intolerance Kingdom of Heaven is a powerful reminder that all the major religions of the world are really just a path to the same destination.
585;keeps you entertained, the story line is one of the best I have seen in some time .
586;this movie has great production values,excellent acting,and an overall very warming,yet violent story about honor,religious morals,and as humans,we can learn to get along through the good of our hearts,and our mercy towards others.
587;i always wondered why 20th Century Fox did not simply have an intermission like the good ole days and keep Ridley Scott's masterpiece the way he created it.
588;i'm happy to have both.
589;the story helps us to appreciate what was happening during the """"Crusades,"""" and there are ample historical perspectives from comments by historians on the bonus disc(s), which help the viewer to know what parts of the film were dramatic elements having no basis in fact, and which parts were historically accurate as much as is possible."""
590;More importantly, it also provides a model to help envision the possibilities for peace and how that might be administered.
591;the story has one of the best morals out there.
592;The best sort of entertainment is this kind.
593;In the Director's Cut, the capacity to understand the torment Sybella had to be feeling, on multiple levels at the same time is wholly present, while in the theatrical release.
594;The story is completely tragic and yet hopeful at the same time.
595;The end is happy or not.
596;The script is top flight.
597;driven wanton lusts in the pursuit of material gain is well illustrated.
598;the Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut is one of the finest cinematic works that I have ever seen and likely will have ever seen.
599;casting is perfect, acting perfect, location.
600;chivalry is forever alive in The Kingdom of Heaven.
601;It's amazing how 47 minuntes can mean a world of diffrence to make a good film a great one.
602;I mean the true treat of this release is the film it self but it also comes with a mountain of supplemental material the documents ever aspect of the films production from pre.
603;This movie is going to go down in history as one of the great film epics.
604;The amount of development that went into this movie was amazing.
605;I thought this movie was good in theaters.
606;it made a good movie even better.
607;Kingdom of Heven has to be Ridley scotts best film since blade runner, and he's made some great films.
608;Mister Scott has done a fine job in the way this film treats the islamic warriors.
609;i give it 4 stars because some of the relationships needed to be fleshed out more.
610;The story of the film has been well discussed in other reviews so I will mention the 45 additional minutes in this cut.
611;i thought that the beginning of the film could use some additional scenes to give the viewer more of a background to Balian, and the new director's cut does just that.
612;The most significant addition to the film is Sibylla's young son who is the heir to the throne of Jerusalem.
613;There is a good deal of discussion about this sub.
614;With the additional footage in the film one can better appreciate the performance of Ms. Green.
615;We also have a final duel between Balian and Guy de Lusignan.
616;A minor addition perhaps but it helps connect Balian to his earlier life and we can observe how the people under siege believe in their leader.
617;The performances are superb: Marton Czokas is, as always, a marvelous villain, Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Tiberias and Edward Norton is an impressive King Bardwin, just to name a few.
618;The casting of Arab roles was restricted to Arab actors and Ghassan Massoud makes an impressive Saladin and Alexander Siding is very good as Nasir.
619;this is a visually stunning and beautifully acted film that held my attention from start to finish.
620;In his Director's cut Ridley Scott has created an epic film worthy of a place among the best.
621;I'm not to sure about how true this story really is but the action is intense and Orlando Bloom's Performance is just outstanding.
622;This movie is also a good drama and it has a bit of a love story to it to.
623;But the was okay and it was sort of Slow and boring, but i liked it.
624;ray format is an amazing thing.
625;the clarity of the images is stunning.
626;a very strong addition to your blu.
627;I found it very watchable.
628;"(On the other hand, the last historical epic I watched was Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" and after that, anything would have seemed good.)"
629;This is a true episode of little.
630;known history, surrounded by alot of untrue details added pursuant to artistic license for dramatic reasons.
631;Kingdom of heaven is a wonderful exercise in fantacy.
632;Ridley Scott has made a good movie about what he thinks should be the role of a knight and has chosen a figure from history to mold the clay of the character.
633;The Technical aspects of this movie were a marvel down to the last detail, the acting was superb with solid performances from supporting cast and main actors alike.
634;If one takes all the time to make sure that the armor is historically accurate and that the events show a period accuracy why not tell the real story.
635;The director's cut satisfies more than the theatrical version, offering more nuances and insights into characters and their motivations,which in turn enhances the story.
636;I wouldn't say it is as good as Gladiator, but it is very good.
637;It beats Alexander big time, and is a better movie I think than Troy.
638;One of the best looking ones I've seen.
639;Boy is this well done from Historical Standpoint during the Crusades.
640;Great actors well written love History and this is well done.
641;mone of my favorite movies.
642;This is a good movie.
643;The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets and music are outstanding.
644;Already owned the standard version but, the added 74 minutes in the Director's Cut helped to explain much more and fill in important details of this great story.
645;A great movie though not really historically accurate.
646;I recently received this as a gift and I'm surprised at the high reviews here.
647;Ridley Scott complained that the film was promoted as an adventure love story instead of a religious conflict and yet that is exactly how he directed the film.
648;pilot as a renowned director.
649;and Bloom's Balian gives us that astonished pirate look!
650;He has a particular interest in the Knights Templar.
651;While not historically correct, it is wonderful entertainment.
652;face statement that history should never get in the way of a good script.
653;Ridley Scott and William Monahan took that to heart!
654;The Costumes are wonderful, the lensing of the whole thing is stunning from start to finish.
655;He looks good, though really needed to reach deeper than his Legolas mode to pull out this performance.
656;it's an enjoyable movie if you have no anticipations, love visual impact and are a Bloom fan.
657;Will watch it more than once, as I do with Arthur.
658;It's a very good movie.
659;I can guarantee that many recent Oscar winners (not bad as one.
660;ray version is definitely worth it.
661;The detail in this sumptuous film (great cinematography, color effect) is amazing.
662;The extended version brought out a complete and terrific story in a dramatic historical setting.
663;suited for their roles, either as the moral baron, his reluctant warrior son, the great and wise desert conquerer, or the complicated Sybil.
664;Gladiator was a great film, but this one has many more fascinating and deep characters, with more than one dimension.
665;"When they finally add an Oscar for ""fixed"" films on blu."
666;As usual for a Ridley Scott film, the soundtrack is a work of art in itself, wholly environmental and involving.
667;The good guys are unbelieveably good and if the bad guys were any more evil, they'd be devouring babies on hoagie rolls.
668;"It's the sign of a weak screenwriter (and director, for that matter) when you are incapable of characterizing your creations realistically, and you must resort to basically telling the audience, ""Okay, this guy's evil because he wants to kill babies, and this guy's good because he wants everbody to love each other."""
669;It shows Christians going to the Holy Land to be redeemed for their sinns, to fight for their religious beliefs and on a smaller scale how some only wanted land and power.
670;the scenery, battles and costumes are very good and believable.
671;Also I would recommend you get the one 4 disc one because it has a buch of deleted scenes that take away from the movie and it helps explain it better, or so I have heard.
672;This Director's cut is way much better than the theatrical release.
673;I thoroughly enjoy Ridley's movies and this one ranks up there.
674;it is definitely worth watching again.
675;The whole thing just makes much more sense.
676;This was an absolutely awsome movie!
677;Great actors and great story.
678;Even my kids really enjoyed it (while they learned something!)
679;This movie was great, and the directors cut was even better.
680;While I loved the origianal theater version of Kingdom of Heaven, the Director's Cut is superior in many ways.
681;If you love Orlando Bloom then this is a good movie for you!!
682;but other then that it is a great movie!!

684;Muslims, on the other hand, are wise, peace.
685;loving, tolerant of other religions, and above all, righteous.
686;This was as exciting for me as the first time I watched it.
687;Good story, characters are right on and the message is clear.
688;This is an epic film.
689;This version actually makes the movie make sense.
690;Because god wills it .
691;I used to love Ridley Scott in the days when he created daring timeless works of art like Blade Runner.
692;Yes, the cinematography is magnificent and the thousands of extras on horsies, impressive.
693;From the director of Gladiator , it was an amazing depiction of the Crusades and the Middle Ages.
694;Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons are excellent.
695;Marton Csokas and Brendan Gleeson are wonderful villains.
696;It has turned out to be a treasure for me in my study of the characters and I have been led to learn much by doing further research and meditation.
697;The film was very well done.
698;The main actors were superb and very convincing.
699;Edward Norton is great in a small role somehow managing to express deep emotion and passion from behind a mask.
700;season movie for reflecting on religion versus holiness.
701;The mere fact that Blockbuster had a full shelf stocked with it, and the first two weeks after it came out that shelf was empty, indicated the movie was probably good.
702;the rest of the movie centers around mounting tensions between the Saladin whose army is certain to be able to conquer the Christians who now occupy Jerusalem.
703;As a result the peace between Muslism and Christians is now over.
704;But ultimately this is not a movie with a sad ending.h2>THE TRUTH/h2>Besides the fact that this is an excellent movie for many reasons, what I like is the fact that much of it is based on historical facts.
705;As an anthropology major, I love movies that are based on true stories.
706;li>I have difficulty finding the real names of the middle eastern actors in this movie despite their great performances.
707;Hollywood is great at stereotyping non.
708;This is movie is a breath of fresh air in that respect.
709;Kudos to Ridley Scott!Now back to my next question: Can Orlando Bloom carry a whole movie?
710;There are enough strong characters, great performances, memorable lines, and an excellent story line to support the movie.
711;There's a ton of bone.
712;No doubt, it's good action.
713;Few months later I bought this version and I'll tell you it is a world of difference.
714;so much is added to the story including scenes with the Liam Neeson.
715;It paints a greater picture of the characters and the way they are entangled with each other.
716;if you like the original version, I highly recommend this version.
717;The theatrical version of the movie was excellent, and contained much food for thought in a world wracked by religious wars.
718;ray edition expecting spectacular battle sequences, and I was not disappointed.
719;This is an extended version, and unlike many deleted scenes, the additional scenes in this edition make the story much more alive.
720;I felt that I understood the movie, the characters and their motivation, much better.
721;Admire the hero at lot, who displays a magnitude of honor.
722;Sometimes hard to find but well worth it.
723;This version has a lot of extra scenes and has an overall blue light effect versus the yellow light effect in the theatrical release.
724;The movie approaches the idiocy of religion, Christian or Muslim, with an expert hand.
725;Like the original Blade Runner, Scott offers us a happy ending, which does not mitigate the message of the film.
726;Only mildly retarded, so you can enjoy it after about four or five beers.
727;The battle scenes are half way decent.
728;truly epic looking crusades flick has some eye popping battle scenes and looks gorgeous on Blu.
729;Ridley Scott's a master artisan whose skills are fully on display in this sumptious production.
730;If one reads in some detail the many historical works on the Crusades (specifically the English translations) one easily sees these inaccuracies.
731;Some historians portray Baldwin IV as intelligent and as tenacious, and it is also an interesting fact that Baldwin IV was a leper from earliest childhood, but was still able to obtain the crown of Jerusalem.
732;It is true however that Saladin refrained from slaughtering the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem due to Balian's threat to destroy Jerusalem and murder its Muslim inhabitants.
733;the success of Saladin's armies in retaking Jerusalem from the Christians provoked the Third Crusade.
734;The movie ends with Richard the Lionhearted (Richard Coeur.
735;it is fair to say that the director wants to play a conciliatory role between the Christian and Muslim faiths.
736;One can be sympathetic with this goal, but a distortion of history never truly benefits anyone, despite the best of intentions.
737;Hollywood directors and screenwriters grant themselves the right to distort or falsify history in order to produce more satisfying entertainment.
738;The same magnificent director, Ridley Scott, who gave us Gladiator, has now given us another epic, historic film, a thrilling, action packed, epic of honor, passion, and courage.
739;He is succeeded by Guy de Lusignan who is married to Sybilla, the sister of Baldwin IV.
740;All of these characters are true historic figures, who do in the film as they largely did in history.
741;The fate of the kingdom of heaven is sealed.
742;Nevertheless, in 1187, Balian leads a heroic defense of the holy city of Jerusalem, knighting servants and peasants to increase the morale of the people in the besieged city.
743;He helped man the fortifications and directed the city's defenses.
744;the final battle for Jerusalem is a spellbinding spectacle and is accurately portrayed.
745;You'll have to watch the movie!
746;Let us just say that as the movie ends, the Third Crusade led by Richard I, the Lion.
747;"heart, King of England (1189.1199)
748;this epic movie is highly recommended with 5 well.
749;An epic movie that never gets old.
750;If you like BraveHeart or Gladiator you will find after watching this film, that this movie is a classic, a hidden gem.
751;Ridley Scott fans should take note, this is one od his best movies If you really like this movie seek out the directors cut with additional footage
752;def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less.
753;I promise you you will not be disappointed.
754;Heaven forbid we actually show history the way it was.
755;well, not really the guy for the part.
756;one of which I found to be the most remarkable scene in the entire movie .
757;Balian returns to the Holy Land and is confronted by the political intrigue of the Christian court.
758;She, in turn, names her husband Guy as king.
759;If you found the previews intriguing, I believe it's worth the time to at least watch it and form your own opinion despite the negative reviews.
760;Ridley Scott is primarily known for his visual style, he's a visualist.
761;The Muslims in this film are portrayed much more sympathetically, they are all good and noble people, including the leader Saladin!
762;Nice way of honoring your wife's memory!
763;This is a really deep perspective on the inner workings of the human psyche, Ridley!
764;That's one of the most basic character motivations you can think of and it works!
765;It worked in Gladiator, even though the film wasn't great, it was very entertaining.
766;williams is the composer of the score and he uses all the old ticks of the trade that Hollywood musicians know so well.
767;Now, that would be a lot more of a passionate film, don't you think?
768;Also when Sybilla approaches Balian romantically, Balian should say, """" Begone you wicked whore, I love only my wife, even if she is only a memory, she is still better than a whore like you!"""""""
769;i enjoyed seeing Jeremy Irons in the movie and I have to say that Edward Norton as the masked King was the best part of the whole film, unfortunately Ridley Scott does not know the concept of directorial restraint because he ultimately reveals the king's disfigured face.
770;If you're an intelligent filmmaker, don't strip your characters of their dignity, especially when the character actually demands it on his deathbed!Ridley Scott is a wonderful filmmaker, everyone has their ups and downs, right?
771;Orlando Bloom plays a very good hero in this movie.
772;He makes his character very real.
773;Although the story line is historical, a great deal of license was taken by the writers.
774;Still, it makes a great flick.
775;The imagery of nearly everything (Jerusalem, the battles, the massive amounts of crusaders, the blood the gore) I enjoyed quite a bit.
776;I enjoyed the fighting for what it was.
777;A learning, historic, look at religeous life when half the world was seeking answers into living.
778;Showing those in power over those who were not in power.
779;Showing a man endowed with honor and common sense overcoming the temptations one is exposed every day.
780;This is one of those stories.
781;thanks to the skill of Ridley as a director and that of his entire production team and cast, the theatre cut was in itself a feast for the senses.
782;The latter's rich complexity of restored sub.
783;right into Ridley's compelling storytelling of the world of 12th century France and the Crusades.
784;If there is one underlying message to this film, it is that you as the viewer need to and can go beyond the deceptive simplicity of faceless stereotyping.
785;When you comprehend Christians and Muslims as real people as they are so brilliantly depicted in the longer version of Kingdom of Heaven, then the utter futility of war for whatever reasons is resoundingly brought home.
786;combined with behind the scenes commentary and features on two additional disks, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven Ridley is not merely a longer version of the theatre release but rather the version that in every way deserves to be considered the definitive telling of this epic story.
787;Great movie had been wanting to get the directors cut for a bit adds a bit more to the film
788;Run Time: 191 MinutesMPAA Rating (USA): RGenre: DramaBonus Features:Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut features a new widescreen feature, commentaries and tons of bonus features on 4 discs.
789;While the cult of Orlando Bloom and his casting is a stern disappointment, the other actors and actresses are phenomenal.
790;Despite limited screen time, Jeremy Irons has a commanding presence as Tiberias, advisor to the king and commander of the armies of Jerusalem, and, despite certain physical similarities, portrays a far more believable warrior than Bloom could ever have dreamed.
791;Martin Csokas is stylishly evil as Guy de Luisignon, husband of Sybilla, and Brendan Gleesan plays a remarkable Reynald de Chatillion, the true villain of both the film as well as the historical event.
792;This movie is an epic story with grand vistas large battles and interesting characters.
793;A good choice if you like Gladiator, Braveheart, Troy and the like.
794;This movie is fanastic, and as a teacher I love it too.
795;This movie does a great job of capturing the various views on the Crusades and nicely illustrates the ideologically diverse nature of the politicos on both the Christian and Muslim side.
796;As a teacher I am infatuated with this movie because aside from showing the nature of the Crusades themselves, it does a splendid job of showing medieval warfare and seige technologies.
797;As a teacher, if you are unsure of any historical facts, the bonus disc includes subtitles that explain a great amount of the historical truths about the Crusades and the people involved in it.
798;Where to begin with an epic of such proportions?
799;Just goes to show how reliance on MBA's can really screw up a great piece of work!Second, it is important to understand that while this movie deals with historical subjects (the fall of Jerusalem and the Crusades in general), there are a number of historical inaccuracies, for the most part introduced for dramatic effect.
800;the Crusades (much like today) was a time of fanaticism and barbarism on all sides, terrible bloodshed and loss to civilization as a whole, but it was also a time of great nobility and selfless personal acts as well.
801;cinematically, this movie is a treat!
802;Brilliant filming of stunning locations, the like of which I haven't seen since 'Lawrence of Arabia!'
803;Excellent use of and appreciation for lighting effects, enormous sets and 'a cast of thousands' plus CGI, what more could you want?
804;i felt that Ridley Scott was evenhanded in his depiction of both sides of the conflict and of King Baldwin, who managed to do what few have accomplished in Jerusalem.
805;As is the case today, the militants and fanatics on both sides provoke their followers to break the peace and let their intolerance prevail.
806;Better yet, let your pastor/deacon/iman/mullah/rabbi or clergy of your choice suggest a movie that portrays their religion as morally superior.
807;The technology forces them to charge more since it cost a lot more to produce.
808;Fox and others undoubtedly will take notice to this.
809;The flow of the story works beautifully.
810;If not ask to turn in the most demanding performances, Orlando Bloom and Eva Green do a perfectly fine job, and are perfectly lovely to watch, as is the rest of the cast.
811;I'll return to this film in the future when I need another good, solid adventure rush.
812;Truly great movies don't come along every week.
813;This one is worth all I paid for it and more.
814;Yet, it has many fine points which makes it a worthwhile viscerally intense viewing experience.
815;"Likely at the time, the public was inundated with sexually appealing epics such as ""The Gladiator"" and ""Alexander""."
816;The Kingdom of Heaven deserves a closer look for its presentation of the historically important Crusades, which is the clash of Christianity against Islam in a very volatile region of the world, Palestine, now modern Israel.
817;There is a very wise and universal message here presented by Saladin, a Moslem leader, which is important for modern times for all of humanity.
818;this rich and deeply moving epic film shows the magnitude and impact of the Crusades on the lives of specific individuals, countries, and the world.
819;Her wrapped body is placed at the crossroads as an example to all.
820;Liam Neeson's performance is magnificent, he is totally believable in the role).
821;On his travels in the city, he meets a beautiful Moslem woman Sybella (played to perfection by Eva Green) on horseback.
822;Learning she is the sister to the king, who has leprosy, and is the wife of one of the more influential Europeans whose closeness to the king, gives him an advantage during the political unrest in the region .
823;their destinies are sure to cross again .
824;the battle scenes between the Crusaders and Moslems are immense in scope and depth.
825;Overall, this film has much to offer the viewer interested in an exciting emotionally engaging viewing experience.
826;I like history, and the complex episode of the Crusades is one of my all.
827;something I've noticed many reviewers criticise.
828;Ridley Scott is one of the few present.
829;day directors (or artists in general) with the courage to speak through his films about the ethical crossroads that individuals (like you and me) must face in their lives.
830;when his unknown father appears out of the blue to offer him a new path in life, Balain sees the necessity to run away from his past, and joins his new.
831;found father's men in their journey to Jerusalem.
832;and that is something important, in fact, it is all.
833;but for Balain, and for us the audience, Ridley Scott has pictured a Jerusalem that is a symbol of an individual's conscience: something that is very easy to sell or trade for a bit of power, or money, that you are tempted to betray every other day, for which you always have the best of excuses (in this case, of course, religion).
834;We see most of the characters do this.
835;What is important is that the director places an individual in a highly complex world (such as ours is) and shows how he can survive and find a sense in what he is doing thanks to a clear moral code (such as many individuals in today's world don't have).
836;Thank you for this message, Ridley Scott.
837;I can only recommend this version (extended) .
838;Ridley Scott is a talented filmmaker but, as any historian knows, this movie is a work of fiction based very loosely on some historical events.
839;surely Mr. Scott knows, as does any high.
840;so, Mr. Scott: please favor us with your enormous talents in making the prequel!
841;The Directors Cut is a must for all those who appreciate the art of story telling.
842;I love this movie, that's all I'm going to say.
843;One can draw a lot of insight and parallels to the conflict going on in the middle east in the modern times
844;Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie!!
845;I got this on sale and it was worth it the movie is great on blu.
846;ray and the special features are great too.
847;Love the added detail and story line.
848;Seeing Sybilla's side adds a whole new dimension to the story.
849;Essentially, Ridley drops us into an astonishing world, gives us a mostly fictional protagonist to guide us through it and tells a damn good story along the way.
850;But really, if I want a dissertation on history, I will watch a documentary!
851;The central theme is what is important here, which is pretty much the same as in Gladiator.
852;I've watched it several times and have loaned it to a friend.
853;"If you have seen and like ""The Kingdom of Heaven"", but you haven't seen the extended version/director's cut, it is a must see."
854;Tells a whole other part of the story, and adds a lot to it without ruining a great movie.
855;kingdom of Heaven is Ridley's Scott's way of telling us that things haven't changed as much they sometimes seem.
856;kingdom of Heaven arrives on Blu.
857;ray in the form of a Director's Cut with added content that did not make it to theaters.
858;If anything, the Director's Cut helps us to understand the circumstances that throw Balian into the events of the film.
859;As a fan of the film I enjoyed the added content but must warn: We are talking about a substantial addition that considerably adds to the running time.
860;One of the major advantages of Blu.
861;in the High Definition front, this version of Kingdom of Heaven is a true revelation.
862;Off the top of my head comes to mind the fight Balian has right after the shipwreck, where his opponent's clothing now literally glows, the yellows popping out in the desert setting.
863;Coustomes were great, acting good and story line easy to follow.
864;I liked this movie a good bit.
865;pros:lot of action, some really familier actors,and a good storyline.
866;scenes videoclips are fascinating for film buffs like me, as well as for those keenly interested in filmmaking.
867;This is an interesting story.
868;Like all interesting fictional stories set against a historical background, you have to suspend your reality beliefs and just enjoy the movie.
869;The scene in the movie is pure fabrication.
870;He and his cavalry (knights) charged through the Muslim line and escaped the slaughter.
871;Reading the book will inure the viewer to the historically insulting innaccuries, and will allow the viewer to suspend his imagination and truly enjoy this otherwise excellent film.
872;the siege scene before the walls of Jerusalem is probably more of what went on than what actually happened, but it is still an exciting and superbly crafted sequence.
873;ridley Scott is a fantastic writer and director, and all of his movies need to be watched and enjoyed solely as the fantastic fiction that they are.
874;Ridley Scott has done it again with panorama, spectacle, stupendous cast.
875;The battle scenes are the most intense of course, and it takes a bit of either past knowledge or research to get the characters straight.
876;It creeps into your soul.
877;all in all, it is money well spent and the musical score is glorious.
878;An ancient question, never gets its answer, but this movie is well done .
879;Historically, fact and fiction mixed together, a lovely and heartbreaking love story.
880;Beautiful music, beautiful people, and beautifully filmed.
881;This is the movie you must see.
882;Its magnificant use special effects.
883;Beyond the action and the breath of the pictures there is an excellent story .
884;I bought this movie in Blu.
885;ray player I don't need to tell you that the picture is fantastic and the sound is great.
886;On the one hand, it's a great movie and I've probably watched it half a dozen times so far.
887;"In this case, the message is pretty simple: organized religion is bad
888;In this sense, the movie seems completely ahistorical, a good example of Hollywood projecting its values onto the past.
889;Ridley Scott's a good director and there are moments in Kingdom of Heaven which achieve a real suspension of disbelief.
890;Ridley Scott (as usual) gets carried away with CGI effects.
891;the armies are bigger, the siege machines more powerful than they could ever have been in real life.
892;In any case, it's worth checking out.
893;A great and beautiful movie, with good actors, wonderful sets and landscapes, deep story that avoids the usual clich s about a difficult subject.
894;Of course, the director's cut is much better than the theater version, giving more time to the story and characters.
895;Love the story and special effects.
896;The director's cut is much easier to follow and is a great movie.
897;ray looks and sounds great and it's one of those movies you can put in to show off your home theater.
898;Ridley Scott scores big this time.
899;the movie was full of historical events and it was pretty interesting, and about 10.20 minutes into the movie there is a pretty sweet skirmish, and alot of continous or important information from there out
900;I have always been a fan of middle.
901;Bloom does a wonderful job as the man you want to be the hero and the one man that can save his Kingdom"
902;The man who plays the king (the one with leprocy) does such an amazing job!
903;Its almost like you don't know who is good and who is bad!Overall, a good movie with very well.
904;Although not historically accurate, it was entertaining as a MOVIE.
905;The greatest strength of Kingdom of Heaven is also it's greatest liability.
906;Ridley Scott's expensive attempt at recreating one of the many great battles by the West over control of the Holy Land is magnificent in scope, stunning in it's presentation, and strong in it's telling.
907;Humanizing both armies and the leaders (Balian, Saladin)On top of this, many of the characters are historical recreations with political events which are drawn from actual events which occurred in politically charged Jerusalem of the 12th century.
908;that being said there are many characteristics of this movie which are good.
909;the cinematography is simply excellent.
910;When a person conjures a picture of the crusades in their heads the picture which Kingdom of Heaven portrays is perhaps as close as you're going to get to that mental image.
911;Liam Neeson is portrayed in his typical mentor/father figure and excels at it despite having relatively short screen time.
912;Edward Norton as the Leper King does a simply magnificent job despite being completely covered.
913;overall, I give this movie 4 stars because it really is a monumental effort by Ridley Scott.
914;It is a great topic, but as a movie it takes on more than it needs to chew.
915;Worked well and well packaged.
916;The film touches on subjects such as redemtpion, spirituality and our personal relationship to God (amongst many others).
917;Better make sure you can play one beforehand if you are in Oz.
918;I just love this movie.
919;"Exce
920;does the film keep your attention?
921;Does the film give you a feel of the time and place that this was all taking place?
922;I loved """"The Kingdom of Heaven"""" as shown in the theater."""
923;The director's cut restores these and completes an already great film.
924;If you liked this movie at all, or if you missed it the first time around and are curious, please be sure to see this version.
925;After you see the movie, you can look up the history of the fall of Jerusalem and see for yourself.
926;This time period was very interesting in the factual form, yet also very entertaining and moving as portrayed on screen, even if not entirely accurate.
927;I finally did on this weekend and, to my amazement,this movie was actually really, really good!
928;I'm surprised it tanked at the box office.
929;But Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson delivered outstanding performances and the set up and storyline were just out of this world.
930;It gives you an idea how Jerusalem came to be what it is now.
931;i highly recommend this movie.
932;But is also has a fine script (written by William Monahan) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and, perhaps more importantly, offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem.
933;present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books.
934;the cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen, David Thwelis, Velibor Topic, among others.
935;The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes (including Bach!)
936;John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography.
937;KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring film to see.
938;I truly enjoyed this movie.
939;I have watched it several times, and each time found something else to see.
940;It was well acted, the costumes are great, as is the scenery.
941;what a wonderful movie I really enjoyed very bit of it.
942;having said that, Kingdom of Heaven is an entertaining movie for those willing to suspend historical accuracy.
943;Well filmed and well acted with some wonderful scenery, this film is not a full meal, but is certainly a good enough snack to satisfy.
944;As a history major, the last movie I wanted to see was one based on the fight between Christians and Muslims.
945;So, I took a gamble and went out and bought it.
946;Ridley Scott knows how to frame a shot and hot to get the most out of it.
947;The next thing that I noticed was the costumes that became more vivid and colorful as the movie progressed.
948;"The elaborate costumes were brought to life by the very talented Janty Yates
949;The siege of Jerusalem is one of the most elaborate and stunning sequences ever put on film.
950;Scott is a master of this type filming, I think that Gladiator was just a warm.
951;Saladin was great and enjoyed the actor who played in this role.
952;as with all of Sir Ridley Scott's movies, there heart and soul to this wonderful movie.
953;I did not see the theatrical version of this film, but I thouroghly enjoyed this three hour plus movie.
954;At the end of this film, I was stunned, I truly think that this is one of the best films of all time.
955;The fact that there is much historical accuracy also makes this movie more fantastic.
956;this is a phenoomnal film"
957;the initial storyline, which is the strongest, regards the relationship between an estranged knight (Neeson) and his illegitimate son (Bloom).
958;Once Neeson's character is gone and Bloom has to lead the movie by himself, the film changes rails.
959;the film is beautiful in the early scenes that take place in the snowy country side of France.
960;Edward Norton is a talking mask that manages to have better range and draw more audience sympathy than Orlando Bloom.
961;Still the overt political correctness is fairly easy to overlook and ultimately harms the film very little.
962;A favorite film, now I won't have to change discs mid.
963;Ridley Scott's 3 hour and 7 minute epic is a movie for any fan of the swords and sandals genre.
964;This helps make an OK film become a brilliant masterpiece.
965;Characters are now more defined with Eva Green becoming a revelation in this new cut.
966;Also Orlando Bloom's journey from blacksmith to knight is now much more credible and understanding.
967;scott's film is in my opinion a better film than Gladiator which was help by a phenomenal performance by Russell Crowe but suffered from story lulls.
968;The battle and fight sequences of which are all directed with Scott's always assured direction.
969;This great 4 disc collection is a must own including everything you could want to know about the making of the film .
970;including a six hour behind the scenes tour.
971;Warranting a whole weeks worth of viewing.
972;As a Moslem, I have to say that this movie is very accurate and objective.
973;a Movie like this one is a break.
974;therefore, Ridley Scott is a water.
975;that being said, my wife and I just watched the movie, and we enjoyed it.
976;It was visually stunning, and the story line was strong enough to keep us entertained.
977;Was it worthy of special note?
978;"I always enjoy a good action film, and this one has plenty to spare, without falling victim to the ""action movie"" plots."
979;Just a wonderful movie to watch.
980;Learned a lot from this movie.
981;the actors was so real.
982;Thank you for getting it to me in one piece.
983;"Fans of Ridley Scott's superbly cast theatrical Crusade epic, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" will be even more pleased with the arrival of an extended four disc ""Director's Cut"" from Fox."
984;As a result, roles are fleshed out, plot points are better developed and the entire film flows more smoothly.
985;Orlando Bloom's character, Balain of Ibelin, was a passively written character propelled to great destiny by happenstance and instantly loved by the cast of kings, queens, and noble knights simply for being the son of a great man.
986;in Ridley Scott's director's cut, Balain is still passive and ridiculously lucky in his relationships, but he comes off as more human due to added scenes that clue you in on his past and how he came by his forty.yard stare.
987;Hamstrung in Star Wars, Neeson returns to true Oscar calibur form here, allowing us to see the deep love he has for his son and the pain he has endured as a Crusader.
988;"Godfrey, noble, sad, and scrappy (""I once fought two days with an arrow through my testicle,"" he relates at one wry moment) is the true heart of the story and in the Director's Cut, he is given the time and care he deserved the first time around."
989;The beguiling Sybilla (played by Eva Green) is deepened via a subplot involving her young son.
990;Green is a phenomenal actress who captures Sybilla's many colors in a moving performance.
991;and all of this contriubutes to the emotional gravity of this visually sweeping film.
992;kingdom of Heaven: the Director's cut is the movie Ridely Scott wanted to make, an epic in the true sense of the word: long, bloody, gritty and thematic.
993;"Restored to full running time, this Kingdom redeems the ""Gladiator Lite"" label and hits you in the kidneys with moving characters, heart."
994;pounding violence,and a truly unique take on a historical period known more for its one sided prostletyzing than its moments of grace.
995;In a period of time known for the evil and cruelty of men, most of Scott's characters seek understanding of their supposed enemies.
996;(He also makes a great action hero, sweating, grimacing and beating the hell out of enemy knights with alpomp.)
997;This is a compelling movie, full of thrilling battles and gorgeous cinematography.
998;now completed with fully realized emotional gravity and a clarity of ideas.
999;It is a film that rewards repeated viewings (you can take in niether the physical nor moral scope in one go)and deserves a place not under the shadow of Gladiator, but alongside it as another splendid artistic achievement by one of our most ambitious directors.
1000;The Kingdom of Heaven is an enjoyable tale with Orlando Bloom as Balian, illegitimate son of Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a noble recently returned from the Crusades.
1001;This is one powerful drama of a movie.
1002;If you like to see good battles watch this movie NOW.
1003;this movie provides some insight as to the beginnings on the conflicts between Islam and the west that still impact the world today.
1004;An excellent performance by the entire cast.
1005;, but the overall pace, action and acting is done well enough to keep your interest.
1006;This movie provides some of the best combat scenes of this age since Braveheart and Gladiator, and provides the same epic scenes reminiscent of Spartacus, Ben.
1007;I highly recommend this as a part of anyone's action movie collection.
1008;This version of the movie has a smooth flow due to scenes be there that were left out of the theatrical version.
1009;I believe this version is better
1010;I can watch this movie over and over again.
1011;It is wonderfully made, historically interesting, and insightful about a formulative era of the World's religions.
1012;result: The movie was much better than I thought it would be, and deserves 4 stars on its own.
1013;Casting was very good, although some of the finest actors might have been a bit under utilized.
1014;Additionally, the Pilgrim's Journey has an amazing amount of information for anyone interested in this time period.
1015;Watch the movie if you like remembering all the while that when Hollywood meets history, history always gets mugged.
1016;Before I review this movie, I have a couple of caveats worth caveatingFirst caveat: I'm into history.
1017;I have uses for all of them, but the first one holds a special place in my heart.
1018;the review: KoH was excellent.
1019;The story line was intriguing and rang very true.
1020;What lies between the beginning and the end is a fascinating, enjoyable story.
1021;the actors (Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson briefly and everyone else) do an excellent job.
1022;I don't know who played the king but even in his leper clothes, he was excellent.
1023;i highly recommend this movie.
1024;a richer and better developed story (don't want to give too much details and spoil it for you), but rest assured, it's a long one with intermission in the movie.
1025;i'm sure the story is marvelous, but I'll never know for sure.
1026;The characters are more developed and therefore much more interesting, like giving them an additional hour actually brought them back to the spotlight, while in the two hour version they seemed like, well, just some folks playing their parts between Big Battle Scenes.
1027;I'd still give the original a three and a half (it's Ridley Scott allright .
1028;the film looks gorgeous), and this one gets an additional star.
1029;Not a masterpiece, but a whole lot closer.
1030;There is extra footing not seen in the thatrical version and it gives s better understanding of the story.
1031;The best I consider is Scott's way to direct.
1032;Let us remember this is a film and Scott and the writers have used the artistic licence to get a great film.
1033;The Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie that came out in 2005 in American theatres.
1034;This is a true Christian ethic.
1035;Godfrey even confessed to Balian when he first confronted him that he was his father and not married to his mother, but he had not forced her to have relations with him but loved her in his way.
1036;the film is one of Ridley Scott's best and is almost up there with Gladiator.
1037;The A&E and History Channel specials on the second disc make it a fantastic addition to the film.
1038;It is nice to see fact vs fiction.
1039;At one brief moment they did, certainly in the location of the central character (Orlando Bloom).
1040;Jerusalem is the focus of power struggles between the Knights Templar and the followers of Saladin.
1041;Saladin is portrayed as a reasonable man.
1042;It is an epic film with convincing action sequences.
1043;Jeremy Irons conveys a weary and gnarled strength as the Marshall of Jerusalem.
1044;"Eva Green is good as the Arabic princess in an arranged marriage to the head of the knights
1045;The movie is packed with action and battle sequences.
1046;I encourage anyone to add this movie to their collection!
1047;The special effects are insane.
1048;It's a summer action flick with a brain.
1049;a very raw look at the time of the holy land during the time of the crusades.
1050;moving and yet action packed well worth watching.
1051;one of my favorite movies
1052;I'd have loved to see more complexity .
1053;and there were some genuinely powerful moments in the film.
1054;but the whole segment with Bloom's duel with a Muslim, release of a """"slave"""" (who turns out to be a noble ."""
1055;norton's portrayal of the King is actually splendid .
1056;one of the best things about the film.
1057;Similarly, the actress playing his sister does a good job with her character.
1058;The only kingdom of heaven there is, he is telling us, is our own conscience.
1059;"the battle scenes struck me as owing rather a lot to the Lord of the Rings films, with one or two good moments, but in general, I thought, ""Goodness, I've seen this before."
1060;That piece of mendacity was clearly thought up in order to give the film a Hollywood happy ending.
1061;at any rate, I finally decided to watch the film again without thinking about the historical and religious inaccuracies.
1062;I found that I could mildly enjoy it in terms of an adventure, but that it still didn't quite work on that level, either.
1063;The sets and the whole look are fine.
1064;three stars for the look, the action, and the casting.
1065;Compared to the theatrical version (2.3 stars), the Directors Cut is a solid 4.5 stars.
1066;Was in very good conditions!You have to take time to watch this movie!
1067;Kingdom of Heaven is one of my favorite movies.
1068;I like Directer's Cut movies.
1069;Saw this one twice a while back.
1070;Excellent story line depicting historic events.
1071;even for those of us who don't agree with religions, this makes for a good action movie.
1072;ray, we discovered that the blu.
1073;What is great about it is that it has some pretty big stars before they were superstars (Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom) and the costumes/visual effects are quite stunning.
1074;The film still holds up and really does give you a feel for what an average crusader's life must have been like.
1075;The movie is a master piece.
1076;It has got to be the best medieval type movie I have ever seen.
1077;other than that small gripe, this film is a must see.
1078;ray and it looks wonderful on the big screen.
1079;Moreover, Kingdome of Heaven is a movie that is worth watching, I will not discount that.
1080;And the story only advances to introduce a new fight.
1081;the actual style and film of the movie is good.
1082;It is very well shot.
1083;The scenes are beautiful and almost take you out of the movie just because they are so amazing.
1084;I absolutely the love the way the movie looks.
1085;Certainly better than many films.
1086;I saw this movie in the theatres and enjoyed it but found it a bit choppy.
1087;Great movie, based on actual occurrences during the Crusades era.
1088;It's a fun ride to watch, with lots of action and adventure.
1089;The movie arrived within 3 days and in perfect condition.
1090;Phenomenal performances on all parts.
1091;disc Set comes packed with cool extras too.
1092;It's got a terrific leading performance by Orlando Bloom ( so far his best role), beautiful locations in and around Jerusalem and a non.
1093;stop feeling of wonder and adventure!
1094;While this director's cut doesn't drastically change any of the strengths of the original release it does have a lot more exposition and sheds some more light on the story and characters of the film.
1095;as I said the story of Kingdom of Heaven remains very strong and entertaining: after a visit form his father, a young blacksmith named Balin follows the crusader to Jerusalem and is witness to actions taken by christian templars and muslims.
1096;While I'm sure this film is far from historically accurate but it does make you think an is much deeper than director Ridley Scott's previous film 'Gladiator'.
1097;every actor is well cast in Kingdom of Heaven: Orlando Bloom is excellent in a quitely intense performance and comes off more as a reflective hero than most action fans are used to.
1098;Eva Green is well cast as the beautiful Sibylla and this extended cut gives her character even more depth.
1099;The rest of the cast including Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, Marton Csokas, Liam Neeson, and Alexander Siddig is just as strong and impactful.
1100;most people will probably prefer this extended release of Kingdom of Heaven as it fills in some character motivations and fills the plot with more exposition and I liked watching it a lot, but I still wouldn't say it's BETTER than the original release.
1101;time movie fan I was able to use my imagination and enjoy it's original presentation in theaters but if you felt perhaps the original film was missing something than this director's cut will probably satisfy.
1102;The special features are quite good as well.
1103;hOWEVER, please be aware that the 4.
1104;but again, if you haven't seen the director's cut of this, find a way to see it as it is vastly better than the theatrical version.
1105;One is his wife, while pregnant, has committed suicide.
1106;the story alone has many facets and many layers that add to the story, even more so in this Director's Cut.
1107;And, while those layers are very intriguing and well.
1108;Though the film does get a good chunk of history right, the politically correct filter of the story hinders it, keeping the enjoyment from being entirely there.
1109;filled violence and epic warfare, along with the creativity of Balian's skills at engineering and being a tactician.
1110;or so of the film i thought the assumptions were correct but after that the movie really picks up,if you liked Troy or even Alexander this movie is better than either of those.
1111;it may start slow to tell a story but hang in there you may be pleasently surprised!
1112;It takes place long ago with todays politically correct thoughts.
1113;Watch this to be entertained.
1114;"net:""Kingdom of Heaven"" is yet another huge blockbuster from director Ridley Scott whose past work has included such big beasts as the ""Alien"" series, ""Gladiator"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Black Hawk Down""."
1115;"The battle scenes are great and reminiscent of Scott's work on ""Gladiator""."
1116;You may think Orlando bloom is overblown, but he's solid, and the rest of the cast makes up for any weakness on his part (which I don't think is there).
1117;At last, the great casting was allowed to flesh out their roles and create characters .
1118;in this wonderfully told story, the interaction of the characters is richly but efficiently developed, and you finally understand what makes Orlando Bloom's character so exceptional for a blacksmith, why the Queen of Jerusalem throws in with her arrogant and homicidal husband, and why a special relationship exists between the Saracens and Orlando Bloom's character.
1119;scott achieves a marvelous balance between the epic scope of the battles and the complex and fragile relationships of that time.
1120;One leaves the film disappointed in the failures of society, but hopeful and uplifted by the promise of new beginnings for admirable characters.
1121;A man who has a son like the protagonist would have accomplished much to make the world a better place.
1122;Nevertheless, this film, while well made, can't compare to epics such as Gladiator or Braveheart.
1123;Love this movie and have watched it over and over again.
1124;I bought this one for a family member as a gift as I knew he would love it too!
1125;Such a favorite movie of ours!
1126;In the director's cut, Sibylla has a son!
1127;the one thing I liked about the director's cut was Balian's sword fight with Guy at the end of the movie.
1128;if you're able to get past this major shortcoming, I highly recommend the theatrical version.
1129;Now that I have had the oppertunity to watch the directors cut it is one of my favorite films.
1130;2) All of the actors did a very impressive job 3)Did anyone else wonder how the heck some backwoods blacksmith was able to do such an excellent job defending Jerusalem?
1131;Most definitely worth the time to see.
1132;I only saw the movie once but it was really good, I enjoyed it.
1133;I bought it for my husband and he loves it watches it over and over again.
1134;i enjoyed this movie: the colour, the music, the acting (well, most of it) and the portrayal of historic events.
1135;Hopefully, this movie will encourage viewers to learn more about the period of history represented for themselves.
1136;Many of the struggles represented here are ones we are familiar with today.
1137;Kingdom of Heaven is an incredible, gorgeous movie.
1138;The sets and costumes are just breathtakingly beautiful, with a soundtrack to match.
1139;It is even more impressive that it is largely factual, though of course Hollywood.
1140;While the theatrical version is good, the director's cut is far superior (and makes a lot more sense).
1141;this is one of my all time favorite movies, which I recommend to everyone.
1142;If you're a Gladiator or Braveheart fan, you'll definitely love this one.
1143;`Kingdom of Heaven' has the action, excitement, and interest.
1144;The story, the cinematography, and the acting are fine as well but I think the film misses its attempt to have an emotional core.
1145;The writers mention the tragic loss of the lead character's wife, and there is a very touching scene on the Mount, but then the matter is subsequently dropped.
1146;It's something he should clearly work on, it's going to keep him back from truly being a great actor.
1147;the film does have redeeming moments, such as the siege of Jerusalem and the humor only brothers.
1148;The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful, and the action is believable and exciting yet not gory.
1149;Ridley Scott's `Kingdom of Heaven' is a good epic and for those who likes this genre will enjoy it.
1150;This film had a story line that I found interesting from the start.
1151;In terms of epic scenes this rates right up there with the epic scenes in Lord of the Rings, in terms of individual fight scenes this rates on par with Gladiator.
1152;i can not defend the historical accuracy of the film, but taking a chance and saying this message in film was quite a bold move especially in these times.
1153;Usually the hollywood myth is that the good guy always wins, or White America always prevails through violence, or we always defeat the aliens.
1154;That is somewhat still a hollywood ending.
1155;This is a great movie.
1156;Its also a plus with the extra disc.
1157;This was an entertaining film.
1158;Regardless, it was definitely worth watching.
1159;Great plot and character development.
1160;I was unimpressed by the Theatrical release and with reading the reviews about how much better the Directors cut is, I wanted to see what at least visually is a good movie.
1161;Hard to believe characters like.
1162;Nice depiction of a priest.
1163;Any and all depictions of Saladin were made as if he were the picture of goodness and honesty.
1164;If Ridley Scott wanted to really be authentic, be honest in your portrayal of both sides.
1165;with this said, it was a visually nice looking film.
1166;Battle scenes were great, acting good.
1167;Some artistic licenses here and there, but overall a nice looking film.
1168;Why would a studio release a film of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras?
1169;This is one of my favorite swords and boards films.
1170;It covers a range of topics that don't take away from the overall story: family, honor, loyalty, religion, military tactics, redemption, and so on.
1171;bloom plays the main character well, without dominating the scenes.
1172;And it is nice to see Liam Neeson pop up in minor roles now and then.
1173;He deserves mention as the wise, honorable leader.
1174;I am a huge Orlando fan.
1175;Orlando Bloom's, Bailian, is a very conflicted and complex character throughout.
1176;While many male leads would have gone over the top with this role, Orlando gives a very understated performance, that makes it seem all more real.
1177;ray transfer is pretty flawless as well, complete with a lossless audio track.
1178;The sound is great, the visuals are outstanding, and the battle scenes are a must see.
1179;Overall, it is one of my favorite Blu.
1180;This movie is jam packed with action/battle scenes, and will give your home theater a work out.
1181;Your audio and visual senses will be pleased.
1182;There is a trivia track that provides historical information as the movie plays .
1183;The climatic battle sequence, the defense of Jerusalem, is one of many gruesome and exciting battle scenes throughout the movie.
1184;spoilers below, but we all know who won, and still enjoy the movie.
1185;As long as you don't take the movie as historically accurate and enjoy it as historical fiction it's a great movie.
1186;The acting in the movie is well done especially by the supporting cast.
1187;if the movie makes you interested in the subject, a good book to read isThe Dream and the Tomb: A History of the Crusadesby Robert Payne.
1188;Ridley Scott has done a good job in presenting this story.
1189;We see that both religions had their fair share of true heroes and true villians at a time when the world was in religious chaos.
1190;Religion is at the very core of human nature, and yet, Hollywood seems to hate this aspect of human life.
1191;Maybe Hollywood has become totally Atheist and they resent the fact that the vast majority of people do believe in a God and in the supernatural.
1192;Most people are religious, and it is about time that Hollywood assented to this fact!
1193;I thought this movie was a great depiction of what I would have imagined the Crusades were like.
1194;Very good movie, lots of action.
1195;One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen.
1196;Just When All Is Lost, The Glory Of God Steps In.
1197;The whole story of Sybilla's son was taken out of the final version.
1198;Nothing beats Bloom's lead role as a reluctant knight with a strong ethical compass.
1199;The cinematography is simply stunning, as it is in all of Ridley Scott's films.
1200;This is one of the best films ever made.
1201;This was a good film!
1202;This was a movie created for entertainment, not to present a balanced view of Christian and Muslim activities in Jerusalem.
1203;The acting was exceptional from the supporting cast.
1204;By far the most amazing performance here was Edward Norton as the King of Jerusalem.
1205;He is masked and his body covered completely and yet he manages with his eyes and voice to completely engage and win over the viewer.
1206;This is the most honest and detail oriented movie I've ever seen about the Crusades.
1207;While it is fiction, the essence of the story is very real, and of course very entertaining.
1208;But it is a rich movie, deep with perspectives, and I give it very high regards.
1209;Kingdom of Heaven is a snuff film made for Moslems, which our jihadist enemies must watch with delight to see the best of our White, Christian men roll around for 2 hours in self.
1210;distributed this slick and entertaining piece of self.
1211;"The West is ripe for the picking, so let us take it."""
1212;Because this movie was so well.
1213;made and visually appealing, I lament all the more its despicable self.
1214;What grates even more was the extreme distortions of history necessary to achieve such a malevolent depiction of one of Western man's most glorious episodes.
1215;And our people lap up this poison with voracity.
1216;It was a beautiful dream 900 years ago and still is today.
1217;How credible was all that?The director's cut demonstrates the importance of good editing.
1218;Both sides, Muslims and Catholics, are depicted with equal attention and understanding.
1219;This said, Ibelin's speech totally fits in the movie as you can understand he has doubts about his faith and god in general when he sees that the holy city has triggered such bloodshed.
1220;i find Ridley Scott's cut to be a true masterpiece of epic films.
1221;and please stop trying to compare this to Lord of the Rings.
1222;And Ridley Scott was already a great director before Peter Jackson even released Bad Taste!And even though Orlando Bloom may have been cast due to his appeal on younger viewers, it does not mean that Scott has been serving a cold plate: Kingdom now ranks among the greatest inspiring historical epics like Braveheart, Dances with Wolves, Gladiator,.
1223;Every step of the movie.
1224;making is shown and discussed in great details.
1225;This movie is even better with the 50 mins of added scenes.
1226;Some of the best on high def and blu.
1227;It should have the decency to include some decent special features!
1228;Orlando Bloom was an excellent choice for the main actor.
1229;it makes the story line so much better.
1230;This one is a sleeper.
1231;I wasn't sure if it would arrive in time, but lo and behold, it came, and in great shape too!
1232;I first obtained the regular cut of this film, and watched it for several years before reading reviews about how much better the Director's Cut is.
1233;While it is longer, the story comes together much better, and the film seems to have more flow, and some plot points make a lot more sense.
1234;Though he is young, the disease has ravaged his body to the extent that he fully swathes himself in fine silks and a silver mask.
1235;Baldwin's humane treatment of the conquered Muslim people of his kingdom, our knowledge of his youth, the beauty of his costumes, the gentle body language of his poses, and the tender voice of actor Edward Norton all combine to make him a wonderfully sympathetic character.
1236;As she gazes, in grief, at her brother's dead body.
1237;shrouded, as he was in life.
1238;He has just destroyed the one graceful thing in this world of violence he has created.
1239;Are these merely realistic battle scenes at the service of historical fiction?
1240;"The brutality may be as believable as any I've seen, though much I've seen (Branaugh's Henry V, for instance) is more artfully done, and thus, more effective
1241;That leaves us with Ridley Scott, the auteur of mayhem.
1242;And he was such a fine and imaginative a director in Blade Runner.
1243;i haven't given this movie one star, as some have, since Jeromy Irons and Ghassan Massoud give excellent performances, Orlando Bloom.
1244;does his best and comes remarkably close to the heroic figure he should be, and the visual spectacle is sometimes enthralling.
1245;It's a much better piece of filmmaking than what is to follow.
1246;He spared this man's life after killing his companion, a renowned fighter, in a sword fight.
1247;Now, (much, much later, mind you) Balian and the man he spared just happen to meet in the middle of a huge, tumultuous battlefield.
1248;Not such believable film making.
1249;This four disc set offers a more complete understanding of the film and the decisions director Ridley Scott made with staff support along the way to bring it to the screen.
1250;The extra disc support a picture of the actual history as well as an understanding of how the various technical teams supported the creation of scenes that viewers would believe.
1251;Visually stunning though, you are transported to the place and time.
1252;tinted, snowy landscape of Balian's home village.
1253;The extended film, as others have wrote, is looong, but worth it.
1254;ridley Scott's artistry enjoys us very much.
1255;etc), you justsit and watch, enjoy and think.
1256;the cinematography, sound, and visuals were fabelous.
1257;all the main and supporting characters were wonderfully acted in the film, specially of Ed Norton's voice of the king of Jerusalem, and the amazing Ghassan Massoud who played Saladin (Salah Al. deen),this Syrian actor has amazed me for his determined and charismatic performance.
1258;this film is a nice journey to the history and the middle ages,and still it has a contemporary message at the end of the film towards today's world events.
1259;just make a peace, a just peace.
1260;It is very well done and clearly expose the chivalry character of the time between the opponent leaders involved in the Crusades in the XI and XII centuries.
1261;ray with extended version that blows away the movie theater release, 3 hours long and worth seeing again and again.
1262;No special features on this disk but to see the full cut the way it was meant to be is well worth it.
1263;Yes, the first half hour of this movie is a little corny and could have played out better, but this movie is very good.
1264;The locations, characters, battles are all stunning and contribute to Ridley Scott's vision of the crusades in Jerusalem.
1265;This movie might not be perfect, but it's still very good and worthy of at least one view by any Ridley Scott fan.
1266;i thought the original theatrical release of this was fairly enjoyable, but having developed an interest in 'director's cuts' since those of the the LOTR movies, i was immediately interested in the possibility that the original might have been significantly improved by additional footage.
1267;this (the director's cut) is one of the finest motion pictures to come out for quite some time.
1268;it has a tremendous intellectual/philisophical depth as well as stunning cinematography which ensure repeated enjoyable viewing despite the running time (personally, i find longer running times that much more appealing.)
1269;he shows true directorial genius in his ability to make minor modifications to history to make a masterpiece of storytelling.
1270;this work should be enjoyed for his ability to do this so well.
1271;I really enjoyed this movie, but found it rather confusing at times, particularly the battle scenes.
1272;But the story was good, the costuming was excellent, and the scenery was fantastic.
1273;An actual Spanish castle was used as the main backdrop.
1274;overall, I liked the film very much, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and intrigue.
1275;There's no changing it, and it's absolutely fascinating, so they might as well give the truth.
1276;What has he done to inspire this love?
1277;Wouldn't you say this qualifies him to rule probably the most famous city in history?And that's not all folks, it gets even better!
1278;Beautiful movie, great production, trademark Ridley Scott panoramic shots that look like giant moving oil paintings.
1279;great movie and very good item since all extra movies and cinematografy is excellent
1280;It makes having movies worth while.
1281;You get an excellent feel for what Scott really wanted to do with this film.
1282;I thoroughly enjoyed it, the extra footage is well worth the price.
1283;The movie was pretty interesting.
1284;Has a pretty decent story line too.
1285;Kingdom takes modern 20th century stereotypes and forces them into a medieval costume drama, and the result are quite horrific.
1286;You should read history and you'll see that the characters are not so real with their performances.
1287;The point is that being a fantasy (that's how i call it) the movie is great, that's all.
1288;I strongly recommend this movie: the cast, special effects and acting are excellent.
1289;Orlando Bloom has an exceptional performance.
1290;It is historically very accurate and objective: most of the characters were real people and the portrait of Saladin the Islamic leader is outstanding.
1291;This movie is a must for people who like history, epic movies, good acting and of course Orlando Bloom.
1292;Here, my caution was rewarded and I was able to enjoy a rare experience undiluted and at my leisure.
1293;This is, as most reviews see it, a very good, very unusual film"
1294;Absolutely on the highest level.
1295;in the armor of the medieval Islamic period, one has the impression of watching vast Delacroix historical paintings come to life.
1296;The photography is very often breath.
1297;Affictionadoes of war or, call them ancient or antiwue battle movies with swords and spears and horses, will will be able to examine closely and to enjoy one panorama after anotehr from very long shots showing position and movement of troops over terrain, to mid.
1298;a couple plainly in homage to Olivier's brilliant charge of the Knights at Agincourt .
1299;the sets are sublime, and there are so many of them and of such wide variety, both inerior and exterior, and of widely differin scale, one's mind is overwhelmed.
1300;Nevertheless, it would probably be fair to say that the film is as profoundly spiritual and sincere as it is anti.
1301;did I mention that it is utterly engrossing?
1302;This master director knows how to utilize and synthesize both found sound, sound effects, and music with the spoken word in such a way that the ear is constantly refreshed, and the mind always stimulated .
1303;Its a kind of auditory confusion few directors can work well, but which he understands and uses like a virtuoso.
1304;The wrier had given to the director a script allowing the director to tell the story mostly with pictures, which is what a good director does.
1305;By using the camera skillfully to show the performers in shifting angles as they move through the scenery not always talking, the director is able to give us more and better information than he could were he only to film conversations.
1306;oRLANDO BLOOM: This actor is well cast in this story.
1307;The young man is obviously a genius.
1308;"Bloom plays a ""perfect Knight"", both an ideal and an idealized figure, and distinguishes himself as a Parcifal or Sir Percival of Arthurian legend."
1309;In every aspect, therefore, the choice of yet anoher heroic fighter, like Russell Crowe, or any other actor of the muscle.
1310;Orlando Bloom's masculine beauty dramatizes the differences between his character and those of the other men who have been hardened and coarsened by intrigue, battle and murder.
1311;"the cast is wonderful
1312;Whoever cast the movie accepted quite a challenge, for most of the actors' faces are interesting and have something to tell us about the story, from the stars to the extras.
1313;The faces of the Muslims were thrilling in their variety and beauty.
1314;Both hero and heoine are beautiful and beautifully matched.
1315;Most of us have seen and enjoyed his other films, and have begun to see what that peculiar gift is that he possesses which runs through all of them.
1316;His primary concerns appear to be about men"
1317;To my mind KINGDOM OF HEAVEN may well be Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece.
1318;He made them all work double or tripple duty, and the result is all for our benefit.
1319;It's incredible that an amazing film like Kingdom of Heaven couldn't have the acceptance (at the box.
1320;balanced mixture of many real facts and some fiction, the story depicts the adventures of Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), a real christian knight (born not in France but in the Middle.
1321;, but it has all the elements of a great epic movie: lot of action, excellent acting and a good adaptation of the real history, including the politics and intrigues during the Crusades.
1322;The acting, sets, and action are exceptional.
1323;But this extended version does justice to Sir Ridley Scott's brilliant creation.
1324;We have enjoyed this version immensely and we cannot say enough good things about it.
1325;This movie was a visually stunning epic.
1326;saladin was noble amongst the Muslims.
1327;It is about the great General Belisarius.
1328;based fiction, but it gives a much truer picture of the crusades than this fiction movie.
1329;I deal honestly and fairly with both sides.
1330;kingdom of Heaven, on the other hand, is mired in its own epic.
1331;"The film has 1,997,301 speaking roles, and not one of these characters is introduced properly or memorable, including the film's protagonist, played by Orlando ""Legolas"" Bloom."
1332;Everyone, including Bloom, are helplessly swept downstream by the film's raging special effects and sets.
1333;One of the only films in awhile I actually enjoyed watching.
1334;"Ridley Scott makes unusual movies
1335;But in my mind this is his best.
1336;Wow, after seeing both the Director's Cut and the original, i know which i would choose.
1337;The Director's Cut sheds so much more light on the goings on in Jerusulem then the other version.
1338;All of the main events from the original movie happen in this one, but this cut is so much more detailed and far easier to get into than the original version.
1339;For all its purported choppiness, I quite liked the original, shorter release of this film, found the script and performances to be stellar in spite of the """"choppiness"""" (like how Bloom becomes a great sword fighter with what seems to be little training)."""
1340;a classy, intelligent, well done film, perfectly cast, and if Orlando Bloom doesn't QUITE have the force of personality that can completely pull off a big inspirational speech, he is perfect at quiet grim determination, snarky comments, and struggling with pain and guilt, or when put into an awkward situation.
1341;Scott's cinematography and spectacular battle scenes succeed in just the right ways .
1342;"If you never saw the ""short"" version this one is worth the price."
1343;disc Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green and other famous actors impells me to rate this as an extremely excellent movie.
1344;The additional scenes in the two discs of the movie made the story line more enjoyable.
1345;The two additional discs provided a historical setting, the views of the director, actors, cinematographers, set and costume designers, and others regarding both the process of making the movie, and the significance of the topic of the movie made viewing it again a much richer and more profound experience.
1346;After viewing all four of the discs, I would have to rate the movie as superior both aesthetically and dramatically.
1347;I would highly recommend viewing and purchasing the 4.
1348;disc Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven.
1349;The Director's Cut fixes this issue by adding in the scenes that help the film's story.
1350;This is very true for this title, it looks wonderful.
1351;the costumes, arms and armour are perfectly accurate for both sides and the main events .
1352;Scot has however taken liberties with the characters.
1353;Tiberiade (wonderfully played by Jeremy Irons), is a fictional character based on Raymond III Count of Tripoli and Lord of Tiberiade through his wife.
1354;balian d'Ibelin (a very convincing Orlando Blum), and the Ibelin family, really existed and Balian defended Jerusalem with such determination that Saladin gave him terms, although not all of the population were granted such terms .
1355;He was perfectly legitimate, and so was his brother.
1356;Both were born in Outremer and the Ibelins were and remained throughout the XIII century, one of the main noble families in Outremer.
1357;but nevermind historical accuracy: the film is superb and exciting.
1358;The battle scenes, from the first skirmish in France to the assaults on Jerusalem, are very realistic.
1359;hugely entertaining and worth a good 4 stars.
1360;If you like films based on history (here the Crusades) and adventure stories with a lot of noble feelings anf high spirits (like I do!)
1361;i highly recommend the extended version solely because it added more depth and emotion to the entire story, blending many lives into the cause and effect of the Crusades.
1362;"this is by no means and ""pick me up, good guys win"" kind of movie which I found refreshing."
1363;this is a must have for people who enjoy movies that show a harsh reality and unabashed truth.
1364;Is this a true Blu.
1365;I have yet to see 300 on Blu.
1366;ray but out of all the movie I have seen this is by far the best looking movie.
1367;When it would show any of the scenery I would pause the movie, my friend and I would just stare at the tv because the graphics are just mind blowing, the picture is sharp and the color is beautiful.
1368;ray and the picture is amazing.
1369;The effects are good, filming is fabulously done, and it is pieced together well.
1370;williams, which means that it is a soundtrack worth purchasing!
1371;Just about all of the omissions are actual in existence .
1372;Beautiful sets, costuming and I enjoyed the story line especially the parts that came closes to actual events in history.
1373;I liked it that they didn't portray Saladin as the bad guy.
1374;I enjoyed the battle scenes, loved Liam Neesons role, sadly not long enough but Orlando Bloom played a convincing Knight.
1375;I loved Jeremy Irons as Tiberias and I didn't know that it was Edward Norton who played King Baldwin until afterwards!
1376;"With the terrific director, Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"", ""Hannibal"", and ""Alien"") at the helm for this movie, and great acting talents
1377;Many times movies live up to their expectations, especially the historical epics"
1378;committal towards their causes, and that the Christians and Muslims got along fairly well for the most part prior to the fighting.
1379;the acting was good, though not always terrific, the story never really lets the audience come to root for any of the characters, especially the lead character Balian.
1380;Overall, the fight scenes were impressive when they happened, but they seemed to be too spread out over the 2 1/2 hour duration of the movie, the acting was good, and the directing was good, but in the end the story is the let down.
1381;Hopefully, some other director will come along that has a little more guts and will tell a more engaging, less politically correct, and more accurate account of the Crusades.
1382;Kingdom of Heaven is rated R for violence.
1383;The director's cut is a welcome addition and makes it much more fascinating than the theatrical version.
1384;The best part of the movie is the production value, including the costumes, scenery, cinematography, and editing.
1385;One of the best item i had.
1386;simply minimalist Like New item with good handling and it comes perfectly, thanks a lot
1387;"Now, I consider this a ""family"" film as well!!!"
1388;Best movie about medieval times so far.
1389;The music and scenery just amazing!
1390;i will recommend the director's cut.
1391;The director's cut was great because it eliminated all the confusion of the theatrical release.
1392;I liked the extras which gave an insight into how Scott worked and also lots of detail on the costumes and how the digital additions were done.
1393;The leading characters are never engaging enough to cause the viewer to really care about the outcome, and thus the movie becomes lots of sound and fury.
1394;christians and Muslims are still fighting over control of the Holy Land.
1395;All these details give the movie much more depth.
1396;Not politics but human beings in their struggle to survive were impressive to me.
1397;one of the greatest and wisest men of his time .
1398;still gives us much to learn from, especially our generals nowadays are far away from his greatness.
1399;learning that Richard I. (Lion.
1400;"lessing's drama ""Nathan the Wise"" shows Saladin asking Nathan, what religion is the true one."
1401;Nathan answers with the famous Ring Parable that the ring's powers could prove true, to live a life that is pleasant in the eyes of God and mankind.
1402;those that promoted peace (tolerance of faith and so forth), and those that promoted (self) righteousness.
1403;It is amazing to me, interesting really, on so many levels.
1404;But really, my point is that I believe all sides got fair treatment.
1405;It scares me I think, to see this extrapolation in the world today .
1406;Needless to say, this has created much animosity between me and that part of the family.
1407;"The ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is this great place on earth that has great religious/spiritual significance for at least three of the worlds major religions."
1408;So, I liked this movie.
1409;I was actually worried that it was going to be Richard the Lion Hearts time line/events of the crusades, so it was refreshing that it was pre.
1410;"so friends, I leave you with this last thought, ""Speak the truth, even if it leads to your death."""
1411;This was a gift for my son and it is so much better than the theatre version.
1412;I highly recommend this version, especially to those that enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven in the theatre.
1413;Enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others that like movies about history and the crusades.
1414;Ridley Scott is the only Director (in my humble option) that can make a historical film believable.
1415;Excellent casting, excellent performances from Liam Neeson and Orlando Bloom (even without the blond hair and elf ears).
1416;The Directors Cut is so much better then the shorter version which was first released.
1417;Great movie for any history buff who likes a movie faithful to history.
1418;released form and the extended version is even better.
1419;"It adds a couple of story lines and several minor ""detail"" scenes that were left out of the shorter version."
1420;I am very happy that I added it to my collection.
1421;ray does NOT include the extra features that are part of the 4.
1422;When will we see the true blu.
1423;Got this as a gift for my husband.
1424;he enjoyed all the extras as well as the extended version.
1425;i found the movie striking and moving, and with powerful messages.
1426;I found this to be an extremely well done and inspiring epic of the Crusades and some of the things that have been ignored for so long about the realities of those times.
1427;Orlando Bloom, as always, is brilliant in his role and the other actors and actresses only add substance to his character by their great performances.
1428;The cinematography is beautifully done.
1429;Kingdom of Heaven is a keeper to be viewed again and again.
1430;As this book progresses Jerusalem and the Christian Crusades it is amazing in that the details are so strikingly similar between the book and movie.
1431;The book JERUSALEM BESIEGED and the Video (Movie) KINGDOM OF HEAVEN go together like great wine and wonderful cheese.
1432;But then I am an avid admirer of (in my opinion) the greatest director on the planet.
1433;"the sheer scale of this film is hugely impressive There is not a better cinematic director with the ""magic eye"" when it comes to pulling the viewer into the world without relying on exploiting multiple efx shots to do so."
1434;hopefully in the years to come there will be a re.
1435;evaluation of this movie and restore its rightful place as a true cinematic masterpiece.
1436;I did not know what to expecting going into the movie but I thought everything was portrayed brilliantly and everyone did a great job acting their part.
1437;I recommend this movie to viewers who are not just in it for the action.
1438;This is a greatly improved version of the movie, it provides more back story and explains and explores the characters much further than the film released in the theatres.
1439;The theatrical release is OK, the directors cut, with almost an hour more of story, is great, more backstory, definitely more violent.
1440;Doubt I will ever watch the theatrical release again.
1441;I love movies from the era .
1442;Orlando bloom is fantastic but Liam Neeson, Eva green, Ed Norton .
1443;All fantastically played and brings the conflict that we face today to the screen.
1444;That cinematic potential is realized in the Director's Cut version which is vastly superior to the theatrical release.
1445;top Crusader Knight which many people like me initially expected.
1446;Bloom plays the main character with such control and subtlety that his redemption in the Holy Land becomes a realistic and compelling journey.
1447;Balien's ability to successfully navigate these landmines yet still retain his humanity is the real focus of the story, and this theme like Balien is subtle and requires patience to fully grasp.
1448;It is this treatment of redemption that makes the film worthwhile.
1449;as for the film's production values, it's a Ridley Scott movie to the core.
1450;I project that in years to come, this film will be a classic period piece and with good reason.
1451;The director's cut deserves very high marks.
1452;Great price and super fast delivery and brand new as stated.
1453;I enjoyed how it started a little slow and then a sweet action packed victory emerged.
1454;Pretty neat cast and filmography too.
1455;i do enjoy the history of it, kind of hard to understand but after an hour and half i get it.
1456;Kingdom Of Heaven is brilliant!
1457;Orlando Bloom gives an excellent commanding performance and leads the cast with grace and poise.
1458;This is one of Ridley Scott's best films to date.
1459;The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent.
1460;The production design by Arthur Max and the cinematography by John Mathieson are impressive.
1461;williams is impressive, as well.
1462;One of the year's best!
1463;This is the version of the film Ridley Scott wanted you to see from the beginning.
1464;I enjoyed the theatrical release of the film but always felt it was incomplete.
1465;My favorite movie to date, has a strong message of we're our relationship is with God and them is conceptions of the Muslim faith.
1466;It is about two cultures fighting for what they belive is right.
1467;It is a fantastic movie.
1468;Overall its a great film.
1469;Kingdom of heaven was an excellent movie, this movie was something that I haven't seen in a long time.
1470;a good warfare/action movie basing itself around medieval times.
1471;right off the bat from starting to watch this movie.
1472;one of my favorite actors stepped into play as a pretty large part, Liam Nesson as the king of Jerusalem.
1473;this movie is 5 stars no problem for me, the story I thought was excellent and I really enjoyed the actual fighting scenes, it go very gory very fast.
1474;this is not a family movie, but it is a very great medieval warfare movie.
1475;"the action sequences were nice
1476;top style like many movies do these days.
1477;the acting wasn't bad either"
1478;I liked it alotMoney well spent for the movie.
1479;other than the lack of chemistry and believability of the two stars, I thoughly enjoyed this movie.
1480;Seems historically accurate, at least as much as possible while still having Hollywood fun.
1481;I'm always late to the party, but sometimes that's a good thing.
1482;i've since watched the movie a couple times more and now I can state more clearly what I feel it's strengths are and complain about my major beef.
1483;"first, I loved the scenes in ""France"" b/c they seemed so gritty and realistic."
1484;second, I thought the siege scenes were quite wonderful.
1485;One could feel the power of the treb's as they launched their missiles.
1486;fanaticism and true righteousness are throughout the movie.
1487;finally, I though the movie was well cast.
1488;All of the roles were well.
1489;played, but these seemed especially nicely.
1490;For the record, David Thewlis' Hospitaller had some of the best lines .
1491;i summary though, if you like well.
1492;made epics with lots of behind.
1493;It holds up well under repeated viewing.
1494;In general it gives a glimpse into the crusades and one man involved.
1495;Good historical facts along with good entertainment.
1496;It was well done, but historically incorrect.
1497;heroic (Pitt, Cruise, Farrel) now get a chance to play a completely out.
1498;And they are found wanting.
1499;He was born 50 years late!
1500;Bloom is credible and Eva Greene as Syballa was beautiful in the long hair or short hair version and the presence of powerful men such as Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson gave it direction.
1501;This movies is one of those movies that will always remind you of how wars don't lead to anything but suffering.
1502;I don't remember when this was film released in theaters but it is a must see.
1503;Which may have been the entire point of the film because this is the strongest message that you'll come away with.
1504;Kingdom of Heaven does a crafty job of making their anti.
1505;Their presentation may not be stylistically dramatic but at least they're honest and fair.
1506;This movie is a favorite of several members of my family.
1507;They will make great Christmas presents.
1508;com was easy and timely.
1509;The cinematography and story line are amazing to see unfold.
1510;The original cut of Kingdom of Heaven was good, but this extended edition gives a much greater insight to the characters.
1511;It is a great movie that is well worth the time and even if you have the original, you should see this version.
1512;"i liked the theatrical cut of ""Heaven"" and bought it the day it hit the stores, so when I heard that there was a director's cut coming out, I wondered why bother when the original was so good."
1513;"There is so much new info here that adds immeasureably to both the understanding and enjoyment of ""Heaven""."
1514;I definately reccommend this movie along with the original cut.
1515;But if you can only afford one, get this one.
1516;In my opinion it was a great movie.
1517;No, Orlando doesn't yet have the ability to truly carry a movie role himself, but I thought he did a very good job.
1518;I simply loved the story, the music, and the true message and meaning of this movie.
1519;The greatest story about becoming a man, since El Cid.
1520;A wonderful look at a man who never thinks God is talking to him (in a world full of people who are sure they have the word of God) and yet he is the only one that lives as God would have us live.
1521;Very few movies are eligible for 5 stars.
1522;This movie has a compelling plot, good acting, and historical prospective.
1523;The movie is shot very well and looks great.
1524;The added footage completely changes, adds to, the action and relationships.
1525;Well done Mr. Scott and many thanks for releasing this magnificent film!
1526;the computer graphics in several scenes would make Godzilla film fans feel right at home.
1527;I am saddened that so many think this film is a masterpiece or will give it a full allotment of stars.
1528;I am used to great films not mediocre ones worthy of such high praise.
1529;Wonderful story line and the action scenes are great.
1530;Love historiy and this movie, though not historically acurate, brought the past to real life.
1531;This 2005 film, Kingdom of Heaven, met that goal perfectly.
1532;the film is set in the 12th century and it's about Muslims and Christians fighting for control of Jerusalem.
1533;He will go to Jerusalem and fight for the forces of good.
1534;The king of Jerusalem is Christian and is trying to keep peace in the land.
1535;He has a beautiful sister though, played by Eva Green.
1536;She's a terrible actress but she has beautiful blue eyes and wears great costumes.
1537;It's very politically correct and tries to show that the fighting was more about personal power than religion.
1538;He's a good actor as were most of the others.
1539;There was good cinematography too.
1540;i really enjoy epic type movies (ie lord of the rings) and would definitely recommend Kingdom of Heaven.
1541;Whatever that actor's in, they look for ways to poke fun at it, even if they give some slack to very similar movies with other actors in it.
1542;the story is an interesting and timely one.
1543;Not all Christians believe this friendship is wise, and soon enough there is a large scale war going on for the city.
1544;He promptly decides to dig a well in about 2 hours they have a well with water and full irrigation going.

1546;He does reasonbly well with the lines he's given .
1547;rage at a deceptive priest, angst over a lost love, courage in the face of overwhelming odds.
1548;i love battle movies in general, and I greatly appreciated the cavalry charges, castle assaults and other such scenes in the movie.
1549;i also found it exceedingly convenient that a man who claims throughout the entire movie that he is of the utmost high moral character .
1550;I guess morals can be set aside when you've got a sexy babe in your arms.
1551;still, all in all it was a fun romp through medieval days, and the supporting cast like Jeremy Irons were great.
1552;I like how the movie tells a fair amount of the story from the Muslim side, and how the Muslim ruler is the one to pick up a knocked.
1553;The message that respect can be found for all religions is a healthy one that I'd like to see more of.
1554;but it still was a good movie.
1555;I got the movie in a decent time frame as stated.
1556;Great movie by the way.
1557;Thank you, Ridley Scott and all the powers that be for delivering a film that is a timeless masterpiece and filled with spiritual truths that still challenge the people today.
1558;I got this for my older brother for Christmas and he loved it, plus he was so surprised!
1559;My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie several times since purchasing it.
1560;Orlando is a fantastic actor and we remember him from other movies, like Troy and Lord of the Rings.
1561;Good entertainment and lots of action.
1562;Maybe the story is true, maybe it's been embellished .
1563;His father was a powerful man, and he asks his son to protect the innocent Muslims who will die if a certain Knight Templar takes power in the holy city.
1564;but overall, the film brilliantly explores the root of Muslim.
1565;Kingdom of heaven comes from Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Blackhawk Down.
1566;The movie is a historic epic of the highest caliber filled with a fantastic score, breath.

1570;The backdrop of this tumultuous time in history serves well to produce a dramatic and passionate look at events that still affect us to this day.
1571;at its heart though, Kingdom of Heaven is a small personal story within the context of huge events.
1572;time blacksmith finds the """"kingdom of heaven"""" to be within himself in his own deeds and choices and plays a crucial role in events so much larger than himself."""
1573;balian serves the King of Jerusalem, a wise and tolerant man who knows that peace with Saladin is not only practical (as they are outnumbered) but also his moral duty.
1574;"The king struggles to control fanatics like the Knights Templar lead by Guy De Leon, a man hungry for glory, power, and riches
1575;saladin, a wise and enlightened ruler has united the Arabs into a single force through his political and military prowess.
1576;Saladin himself is a quite tolerant man, and both him and the King of Jerusalem maintain an uneasy peace while religious zealots on both side cry out for blood.
1577;The story is by and large, historically accurate.
1578;While some characters such as Balian, were fictionalized in trivial ways to fit with the storyline, the larger events as well as the atmosphere itself is wonderfully portrayed.
1579;all tells a much greater truth, exploring the role of religion and symbolism in human conflict, the constant struggle between tolerance and intolerance, and how each of us can make a difference within all of it in our own choices and attitudes.
1580;the special effects are top notch and the cinematography is absolutely excellent.
1581;Kingdom of heaven has some of the finest camera work of any movie, and adds to the terrific script and intelligent dialogue.
1582;But within that larger story is the story of one simple man, who on a pilgrimage to absolve his sins finds answers to questions about life and managed to do great things and find for himself a new beginning through helping the defenseless and seeing the world through clearer eyes.
1583;And at the end, even though the cycle of violence and tragedy to be only just beginning (and still is today), he is able to start his life anew, and presumably is able to live his life in peace with the knowledge that the kingdom of heaven is within us all.
1584;To any that love huge, passionate, explorative films that respect the complexities of the real world instead of giving in to the Hollywood urge to tell only one side of a story, give this movie a look!
1585;And to anyone looking for a wonderfully.
1586;crafted modern epic filled with action, intelligence, and a meaningful commentary on the motivations that drive men to fight, then this movie is also for you.
1587;There is also a very nice feature that pops up information bubbles during the movie pointing out production decisions relevant to, and/or historical gripes and points about, that particular scene.
1588;Kingdom of Heaven is the quintessential epic film.
1589;It harkens back to many of the epic motion pictures of the '50s and'60s.
1590;Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson provide solid performances.
1591;The costuming and the extras bring the age of the crusades to life.
1592;Anyone who appreciates epic films or recreations of history will enjoy this film.
1593;for the Kingdom of Heaven I thought I did that with the 2 diskKingdom of Heaven (2.
1594;This is one movie you must own.
1595;The acting, the locations, the costumes, the story line was awesome even when it has a Hollywood twist from the historical person, events, and places.
1596;but hey its very entertaining and you will love it as well.
1597;ray transfer (also excellent), but the absence of extras on the Blu.
1598;This a movie that everytime that you see it you notice something new.
1599;It is going to become a timeless classic!
1600;Part history, part love story, part religion, part war what else do you want in a movie Drama, action, love, history .
1601;The Director's cut is something special.
1602;And the director's cut would've been my favorite film of 2005, hands down.
1603;It really is that wonderful.
1604;the film reaches out and grabs you in a way the theatrical cut could not.
1605;The characters are now rich and full and several of the plot points carry more weight because they've been given greater context.
1606;If you liked the theatrical cut, then you must see this version to see what Ridley Scott truly wanted.
1607;oh, and the fact that it's a 4 disc set and the extras are also highly informative and entertaining helps quite a bit.
1608;Kingdom of Heaven is an epic film about the Crusades.
1609;While it did not do well at the box office with a gargantuan $130 million budget this film is well worth seeing.
1610;The director's cut reinstates over 45 minutes of important scenes that greatly add to the impact of the film.
1611;It comes packed with over 4 hours of special features.
1612;A text commentary stream consisting of both production and historical notes, synchronous with film, Interactive Production Grid .
1613;Ridley Scott again shows his mettle and sure hand with action films full of the violent and spectacular scenes and melees that are his forte.
1614;Although most probably won't say this is a greater flick than his previous Blackhawk Down, I enjoyed it more, probably because of the historical connection to events present and past, and the film's story seems realistic enough so that it could have happened, and perhaps it did.
1615;All the performances were excellent, and I even thought Orlando Bloom did a decent job in his role, although up against competition like Neeson, Norton, Gleeson, and the guy who played Saladin (don't know his name, but he brought a convincing and studied intensity to the role), he has his work cut out for him.
1616;To employ an overused word, the battle is truly awesome, and reminscent of the opening scene in Gladiator, but even better.
1617;So I thought that part was quite accurate and pretty interesting.
1618;Scott deftly unfolds the events and the action, controlling the pace of the movie with a sure hand, until the final climactic scene.
1619;Overall, another fine film from Scott and worth seeing on the big screen.
1620;I thought I was a savvy shopper, obviously not.
1621;I have never returned anything to Amazon but it was a wonderful experience.
1622;I received the movie late Saturday evening.
1623;I thought I had ordered the blue ray extended director's cut with the 4 discs.
1624;This is the second time I watch this movie (original theatrical release), and I enjoyed it more than the first time.
1625;the director makes a real effort to be faithful to the historical and cultural settings.

1627;If we put our imagination to work, we can move past the anachronisms and out.
1628;place criticisms the director forces on us, and enjoy the movie as if we were right there, defending the city.
1629;For one, the film was grand in scope but this cut makes it even more impressive!
1630;It is one of Ridley Scott's best films (and with great films like """"Gladiator,"""" """"Blade Runner"""" and """"Black Hawk Down,"""" this is praise indeed)."""
1631;There is a part of the story that we didn't see in the original cut .

1634;al. din, and the people are saved by the son's cunning and kindness.
1635;I liked the interpretation of Balian by Orlando Bloom.
1636;He may actually have an acting career if he continues to take parts that require him to act.
1637;He did a good job here, and for an overall period piece on the Crusades, I would give this movie 3 and a half stars.
1638;It was worth sitting through, it is nicely done with the costumes and the scenery, and overall, the major events are somewhat accurate.
1639;the choice of the lead character, Balian, was a good one on Hollywood's part, as he is treated well by the history books as one who was respected by both the royal court in Jerusalem as well as the Moslems.
1640;The rest of the story is pretty much true.
1641;the story is Hollywood, woven around some actual facts.
1642;Probably what got this film an R rating, as I see it.
1643;There were enough bad guys in the Crusaders court to hold the story together.
1644;if you want something that is entertaining with a Crusader theme, this is a good choice.
1645;Orlando Bloom really does act in this film, proving he can be more than just eye candy.
1646;Liam Neeson is excellent as ever, as Balian' father.
1647;Jeremy Irons as the trusted Tiberias was an interesting character as well.
1648;enjoy the movie for what it is .
1649;This is the Hollywood rendition of the Crusades and the Fall of Jerusalem, and they tell it in the best entertaining way they can.
1650;If you take this into consideration, then you will enjoy this film.
1651;Great movie about the Crusades.
1652;helped me in understanding the time and the movie.
1653;Moslems are good and you best get your roman tails out of Jerusalem.
1654;The script and the story are light brush strokes on what had the potential to be a lovely colorful canvas.
1655;I am sure many will enjoy the special effects.
1656;As a movie this one has it all, love, hate, religion, action, sex, intrigue.
1657;Now that I have seen this one, the story is MUCH better.
1658;Ridley Scott is and excellent storyteller.
1659;Hopefully we'll see more of this kind of movie in the future.
1660;At times a little stiff, and glossing over on detail, I nevertheless find this to be an educational (showing the plight of religious differences and similarities that haunt the region to this day, plus the issues with travel and necessities of life like water), touching, and entertaining view of how it was possible for man to rise above the rigors of daily life and lack of education to show how actions can make up for these shortcomings in a person.
1661;Good exists in all men, even if sometimes they must do a little bad for greater good .
1662;And I believe Scott gave us a delightfully gray world.
1663;balian's motives are simple enough: He seeks forgiveness.
1664;So he just does the best he can.
1665;This film has it all.
1666;I particularly enjoyed Ed Norton as the leper king Baldwin and the steely eyed Ghassan Massoud as the wise Saladin.
1667;and there's some pretty good action here .
1668;The film does a pretty good job of ending where it begins, lessons having been learned at least by one man.
1669;I saw it in the theater and I was one of about a half dozen people there.
1670;I'd give it four and a half stars if I could.
1671;liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon.
1672;There is a red plastic piece on the right side.
1673;Those discs are inside for good.
1674;A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today.
1675;I loved the background features, the additions to the story with the son, and the changes to the whole film.
1676;Definitely worth the money, and you'll enjoy this version much more than the theatrical release.
1677;It is a little to bloody for me but the men in my life seem to enjoy it.
1678;I am a history buff so I was thrilled with the story, period costumes and the scenery, but I had many questions about the characters.
1679;Then I discovered this truly magnificent Director's cut and I got my answers.
1680;It moved my heart and left my soul full.
1681;The character development of Balian in respect to those around him had depth and richness.
1682;I believe this part of the movie developed Sybilla's character and led to the more complex interaction with Balian.
1683;This film gives you the opportunity to share the feelings of anguish and guilt felt by Balian and Sybilla.
1684;this is the movie version that should be a part of film history for its scope and range of feelings.
1685;This is a GREAT movie!
1686;The costumes, the scenery, and the sets are so AWESOME that you feel like you are actually in that time period!
1687;The characters are so interesting, especially the leper king with the mask.
1688;The story is very good, and kept me drawn to the screen the whole 3+ hours, which didn't feel that long.
1689;This is a very beautiful movie!!!
1690;Enjoy it in it's Director's Cut glory!!!
1691;Ridley Scott is a genius of modern cinema.
1692;I rate the movie 5 stars.
1693;This story has it all, Love, Ideals, and a Happy Ending.:.)
1694;I typically like Ridley Scott, but this is definitely not one of his best films.
1695;In my opinion, Kingdom of Heaven is one of the most underrated items I have come across.
1696;It is one of my favorite movies of all time and receives very little attention.
1697;The extra scenes explain the story considerably better.
1698;The movie is a steal at $10 and the picture looks really good.
1699;If you are interested in history or action movies, this is definitely a movie to check out.
1700;Throw your theatrical release out the window or sell it to blockbuster because this the definitive cut.
1701;Orlando's character, Balian, was much more convincing as the flashpoint of the story and Sybilla's character made much, much more sense.
1702;"I have to give it to Ridley, he knows what he's doing and has made this film into a classic
1703;This is now one of my favorite films!
1704;This stunningly beautiful movie by Ridley Scott was ripped to shreds by the editing demanded by the American movie industry.
1705;This Director's cut restores its integrity and incredibly rich depth.
1706;If the story of Ibelin was a little embellished, it was worth it to get an up close and personal feel to the moral dilemma of the era .
1707;This is truly a great movie to rival anything produced in Hollywood over the past 30 years, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
1708;I have watched this movie countless times , the storyline is just great , the battle scenes are gripping , awesome movie overall .
1709;Here is yet another Hollywood movie that excels in the first category but languishes in the second.
1710;Ridley Scott is one my favorite directors of all time, and when I heard he was doing a movie on the Crusades I was quite excited.
1711;Ridley's directorial hand is as sharp as ever here, and he even does a great job of turning the bland Orlando Bloom into a believable leading man.
1712;One reason I like this type of movie (even if it isn't entirely historically accurate and clashes with my Christian worldview) is that it takes me to a time in human history that I've never been to, and gives a vivid portrayal of what life was like in the period of the early Crusades, with all the brutality and beauty that piece of human history entailed.
1713;And this is the message of the movie in a nutshell: living according to the conscience that God put in you is far superior to living according to some fanatical religious creed.
1714;The """"kingdom of heaven"""" of the title is repeatedly referred to as a """"kingdom of conscience."""""""
1715;"The Hospitallers are committed to living in peace with the Muslims because, after all, ""their prayers sound like ours."""
1716;a priest, a bishop, and the pope .
1717;The Directors cut is much better.
1718;I loved Kingdom of Heaven when it came out, and watched it several times.
1719;The Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut contains nearly an entire hour of, not only scenes, but entire sub.
1720;the director's cut is the definitive version of the film that contains entire sequences of film that are utterly necessary for appreciating the character motives and some of the plot twists in the film.
1721;I highly recommend this version of the film to anyone who enjoyed the original.
1722;If you liked the theatrical version at all you'll love the directors cut.
1723;But the directors cut is a great movie that fills in all the missing pieces.
1724;(Note:For those wondering which version to watch, go with the Director's Cut.
1725;His strong visuals, contemplative themes, epic scopes and fantastic casting are always present on screen.
1726;At times Scott can reach Kubrick levels of detail in his visuals.
1727;Say what you will about that film, but it's visuals certainly weren't a problem.
1728;but when Scott can hit it out of the park, he does so amazingly.
1729;The man has done Alien and Blade Runner, two of which are considered some of the absolute best Sci.
1730;As a result, those who saw it found the DC to be a much better film than it's theatrical release.
1731;ray (one of Fox's first titles on the format) to stellar reviews.
1732;while I can acknowledge that Scott's previous works like Alien and Blade Runner are classics, I feel that KOH is the director's best film.
1733;Its sheer ambition and craftsmanship alone makes it a great film and watching all of the pieces come into place is a sight of beauty.
1734;Its gorgeous camera work, lavish set and costume design, excellent performances, strong pacing and it's thoughtful message strike a cord that most epics of this size fail to do.
1735;She's charming and seductive, but there's something obviously happening underneath the smiles.
1736;the scale of the film is HUGE.
1737;The pacing of the film, despite its three hour running time, is absolutely top notch.
1738;On top of that, damn near every character is vital to the plot with great character development to balance it out.
1739;This is thanks in part to the sharp writing provided by William Monahan (The Departed, with Kingdom being his first script no less!)
1740;Some of his speeches near the end come off as nicely rousing and even a little bit encouraging against the face of death.
1741;Eva Green's Sibylla starts off as a charming but mysterious princess in the first half but turns into a beautifully tragic figure in the second, as her world starts to crumble around her.
1742;There's something of an aura that surrounds the King, one that is both commanding and gentle in all the right ways.
1743;On the other end of the equation, Csokas and Gleason provide great supporting roles as the ruthless Templars.
1744;An extremely fierce and charismatic performance is on display here, with Massoud providing one of the most respectful performances for historical figure I've ever seen.
1745;"i could go on and on about some of the film's other great performers (David Thewlis in a supporting role as a wise ""Guardian Angel"" of sorts towards Balain or Jeremy Irons' in one of his most entertaining roles in quite some time), but to do so would turn this review into something of a tangent, so I'll move on to the next part: The film's production design."
1746;Just about every single detail in the film is put into frame under lavish direction.
1747;Scott and Cinematographer John Mathieson create some utterly brilliant vistas.
1748;Another outstanding thing about the film is its usage of practical effects rather than CG.
1749;While CG is used in spots here and there (the city itself, a massive siege that happens at the film's climax, a boat attempting to sail across the roaring waves, etc.), practical effects stand tall here.
1750;Action scenes are also exquisite to watch.
1751;Make no mistake: The film earns it's R rating well.
1752;sound also plays a big part in Heaven and it's equally up to snuff.
1753;Harry Gregson Williams' score is at once epic and grand, but also personal and subtle.
1754;It really helps highlight key moments and compliment then well, though I think his score is outshined by the film's usage of a fair amount of licensed music.
1755;Even Ms. Green, who just started out at the time the film came out, delivers a more rich performance than Bloom.
1756;Still, I think he gets the job done and his character development is enough give him a pass.
1757;Still, I felt satisfied with the one they took.
1758;It's delicate and respectful approach to the period it takes place in and Religion is nothing short of outstanding, coupled with equally great production design, action, music, script and casting.
1759;I very much doubt that Scott will ever make a film as excellent as this, but I will continue to welcome whatever comes from him.
1760;The scenery is beautiful and has moments where it is better than the movie.
1761;If you like epic or long films this one is worthy to be in your collection.
1762;I wonder if it is historically accurate.
1763;Special effects were very real.
1764;Love the movie an all time favorite can watch it over and over again really like that it has historical content
1765;It's one of my favorites movies of all time.
1766;Also the music and effects are amazing.
1767;oRLANDO BLOOM as Balian is excellent.
1768;He shows that he can handle to play the leading role.
1769;the movie has also other famous stars.
1770;He gives such an impressive performance (like he does always).
1771;eDWARD NORTON as the king and MARTON CSOKAS as Guy de Lusignan are also amazing.
1772;It has a lot of touching scenes.
1773;I think it's a REALLY good movie.
1774;i think RIDLEY SCOTT is a brilliant director.
1775;He makes so many good movies.
1776;The terms between the two kings after the battle at hattin is one of the best parts of the movie.
1777;if I was to have my top 5 epic movies, this is definitely on top of the list followed by:2.
1778;ray, this one is definitely one to go on a collection at a great price.
1779;This movie was a lot better than Alexander and just about as good as Gladiator (Rome seems to be more sexy than tales of the middle.
1780;It will turn out later that the man that he spares is the son of the Arab king and each man will continue to do favors for the other throughout the movie.
1781;"bloom ends up in Jerusalem and catches the eye of the ""married"" sister of the local king."
1782;there are some excellent battle/siege at the castle scenes as good as Troy, Arthur, Lord of the Rings and all the other movies of that genre.
1783;bloom makes and excellent hero and he seems to make the impossible happen.
1784;I really liked this movie.
1785;"Scott has a way with epic battle scenes and he does extremely well in graphically displaying the brutality of these so. called ""holy"" wars."
1786;Beautifully filmed and heroic in scope, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is one of those misfires, like HEAVEN'S GATE, that suffers from its extravagance.
1787;This is a noble dramatization of how some leaders' consciences may have played out during the crusades, and specifically, the seige of Jerusalem.
1788;The moral, religious, and philosophical approaches all held something that everyone could appreciate.
1789;I could watch this movie a dozen times and then watch it again.
1790;One of my favorite all time movies.
1791;Has many of my favorite actors and tells a great tale as only Hollywood can,
1792;On viewing the movie again, knowing how Bloom would be directed and play the part I found a whole new appreciation for the film.
1793;The film work is superb and the sound is perfectly supportive of what is happening on the screen.
1794;it is significantly longer with purpose and adds to the overall scope of the movie.
1795;The full 1080 resolution opens the cinematic detail of the film and the sound is crystal clear and detailed.
1796;I reserve 5 stars for maybe a dozen films and that may be more of how those particular films have deeply affected me.
1797;fares far better in this version, and actually makes the character come alive!
1798;I highly recommend this director's cut, which in my opinion is quite possibly the best Ridley Scott has ever made!!
1799;But somehow (and refreshingly) that seems to make it more realistic to me because dramatic and intense scenes are often more to advance the plot and are thus more artificial than representative of how people behave in real life.
1800;The movie's greatest strength is perhaps Ridley Scott's direction.
1801;The battle scenes are excellent, from the forest fight in the beginning, that reminds this viewer of the opening battle in GLADIATOR, to the siege of Jerusalem with siege towers and catapults and casts of thousands.
1802;The costumes and the sets are very realistic.
1803;For a history buff like me, it is a joy to have such versimiltude.
1804;In one scene I recall seeing a beat.
1805;That is great attention to detail.
1806;It was a nice touch in this subdued movie to have our near.
1807;mute hero Balian of Ibelin's lady love interest come riding wildly into a scene in bright clothes and then lower her veil to expose a exotically beautiful and intellgent face.
1808;On the other side, there is only a brief scene where a character approaches Saladin, the great muslim general, and reminds him of his promise to take Jerusalem.
1809;It is the writer's real task to tell it like it was in the past and, my friends, there are two sides to this story.
1810;the drama of this movie will keep you going and waiting to see the ending.
1811;What you get is a sometimes tragic yet epic look at the bloody history of the crusades which was ravaged with violence perpetrated in the name of religion and a unique character study of some very interesting and deep characters.
1812;The cast is tremendous all around with particularly good performances by it's supporting roles including: Edward Norton, David Thewlis, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons.
1813;The romance with Sibylla is also fictional.
1814;And Balian had a wife and children in Jerusalem.
1815;Kingdom of Heaven focuses on the clashes between Latin Christian (Crusader) factions who wished to live in peace with the Muslims and those who wanted war.
1816;The constant struggle between those Crusaders and Pilgrims who had been in the Holy Land for generations and learned to live with the Muslims and the fanatic new arrivals who trickled in from Europe and wanted Muslims removed from Christian holy sites is a theme that comes up throughout the film.
1817;"But ""Kingdom of Heaven""'s political and religious themes are thoughtful and instructive, and the Siege of Jerusalem is captivating in widescreen."
1818;Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.
1819;I think Orlando did an excellent job.
1820;I think he's an excellent actor.
1821;Yes, he had some great moments, but when the story ends.
1822;despite these negatives I found myself interested in this film.
1823;And the cinematography was excellent.
1824;And that's good news indeed.
1825;the background and costumes feel authentic.
1826;"when Bloom arrives in Jerusalem he finds a liberating ""world"" where Muslims and Christians live together in the heart of the world."
1827;"at it's core, KOH is about human consciousness of ""doing the right thing""."
1828;"Bloom's negotiations with Saladin are mostly true, for instance, and, phrases like ""God wills it!"""
1829;Like all Ridley Scott movies, it is beautifully filmed, has some exciting battle scenes, and is competently performed.
1830;Instead, he is the most extraordinary blacksmith that ever lived!
1831;Next, after a brief swordfighting lesson, he's able to easily defeat men who have trained since boyhood to be warriors.
1832;Oh, he also has the ability to instantly bond with royalty so much so that he's offered a kingship.
1833;Insulting Christianity is easy and painless because what the heck are Christians going to do about it?
1834;, I can think out a 24 page research of how good this movie is.
1835;"one of the best films that you'll see in this generation
1836;Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) flexes his visual muscle, and he shines in overwhemling battle sequences, aided by John Mathiesons' sweeping camerawork and Dody Dorns' forceful editing, both of which are crafted with extraordinary skill.
1837;But """"Kingdom of Heaven"""" commits the cardinal sin of epic moviemaking: it let the story play second chair to its' own visual splendor."""
1838;The Templars eventually get a golden oppurtunity, potentially spoiled by the presence of Balian, who Baldwin admires and his sister (Eva Green) takes a liking to.
1839;even though the film is fatally flawed, that does not mean it still has plenty going for it.
1840;Ridley Scott still stages battle scenes with muscular verve, and the sieging of Jerusalem is spectacular.
1841;He's blessed with a great supporting cast.
1842;but all of those strengths are peripheral to the main plotline and Bloom.
1843;Bloom, to his credit, gives the role everything he's got, trying to register the look and feel of a man caught up in extraordinary circumstances, but he simply does not having the acting chops needed to pull it off.
1844;I was expecting a great movie, based on the subject matter and the director.
1845;I enjoyed the scenery and the sets.
1846;Many scenes were interesting within themselves.2.
1847;This character was a fascinating interpretation of the real King Baldwin IV.
1848;I immensely enjoyed every scene he was in and he always kept me interested.4.
1849;Some very good large scale battles.
1850;The interesting ones are killed early, and many of the rest are caricatures.
1851;"EVERTHING goes his way from day one: King thinks he's great a first sight
1852;I can give wide latitude to an action film, but this was over the top.4.
1853;The extended version is the best.
1854;It brings certain characters full circle.
1855;I know it's not a factual account but I enjoyed the story line.
1856;This version I enjoyed the most, it gave more back ground on Balian and his father.
1857;I have the original version and then I bought this one.
1858;I've already seen it countless times because I enjoy Orlando's movies so much.
1859;I was worried because I didn't think Orlando Bloom could carry the movie, but he did a fantastic job.
1860;I couldn't get past picturing him as the elf in Lord of the Rings, but now I see him with new respect for his talent.
1861;The music, the directing, the acting.
1862;A great film for lovers of history.
1863;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.
1864;She is a huge Orlando Bloom fan.
1865;I have not seen the movie but my 22 year old daughter says it is really good and has watched it a couple of times.
1866;orlando Bloom really surprised me since he managed to grow every second of the movie and portrayed himself as a real unwilling hero, I was also happy and taken aback by the casting of Edward Norton as King Baldwin IV since he managed to project strength and pain only with his voice and I really got to love his character.
1867;this story is not only astounding in the casting that also had Ghassan Massoud as Saladin and Khaled El Nabaoui as Mullah that are totally new for me and where really inspired in their performances but it also shows a part of history that I never knew and that in this times is really important, peace, an armistice and respect between 2 great kingdoms, 2 great men and 2 religions.
1868;i think this movie is a must see, not only as a learning experience but as a entertainment since the action is a big ingredient of this story.
1869;i totally recommend and praise this story, Ridley Scott managed to create another beautiful, gorgeous and striking world in this movie with the help of the remarkable writer William Monahan.
1870;Be well and take care.
1871;The 40 to 50 minutes added turn Kingdom of Heaven from decent to a flat out masterpiece.
1872;The case is beautiful, the extras run for hours on end, and the film is finally being shown the way it was always meant to be.
1873;If you didn't like gladiator, you like orlando bloom(you have to really like him), and you like movies with no beginning OR ending, then this will be perfect for you.
1874;Much to my interest, """"The Director's Cut"""" came my way."""
1875;"Curiously, some ""Director's Cuts"" are just a few sunsets added, along with 5 or 10 minutes of some guy riding a horse across admittedly spectacular scenery."
1876;the added material in fact gives a lot more to the plot, and I agree with Ridley Scott that some of it should never have been removed.
1877;the characterisations and the depth they receive with the added material also make a richer and more rewarding movie.
1878;In some parts, Orlando Bloom seems a little contrived, but overall the acting is first class, to match the first class cast.
1879;It is very thorough in all respects, including the supporting materials on the other 2 discs.
1880;This is an excellent movie version and the package is well worth getting.
1881;"Make no mistake
1882;What we know is sketchy at best and of course viewed and skewed from the Christian perspective.
1883;A custom, the movie explains, with those who commit suicide, so their soul cannot find their way to heaven.
1884;bloom and Neeson's performances are excellent and I even pictured the bearded Bloom as a young Errol Flynn.
1885;the kings regent, Ed Norten as the leprous King of Jerusalem and Eva Green as the King's sister and Balian's love interest.
1886;this was the first movie I have seen with the lovely Eva Green since her saucy performance in the highly erotic Dreamers.
1887;Although I enjoyed viewing her in the altogether it was nice to see her clothed and moving on to bigger things.
1888;The cast overall was magnificent as were the truly imaginative battle scenes.
1889;The colorful costuming was spectacular and the sets, especially Jerusalem were superb.
1890;It gives the viewer a true feeling of the scope and majesty of the Levant .
1891;ray picture and sound is an experience.
1892;I would say it is the best blu ray film available to date!
1893;If you do, this film is pretty spectacular, though not all that realistic.
1894;For that reason I would rate this film """"well worth seeing""""."""
1895;This is a well made albeit blood.
1896;There are a decent number of medeival style movies out there and some are pretty darned good.
1897;the D. cut adds a solid amount of character development and really sets the stage for why people act the way they do and this is important in any movie but especially so in such a grand epic tale.
1898;The added scenes/footage were both neccessary and very well edited as if they were there the whole time.
1899;I really enjoyed the extra time given to the prevalent back.
1900;the storyline is very well done and doesnt have any major holes in it.
1901;Otherwise, he is very believable and you do actually care about his fortunes as the film goes on.
1902;its a very tough situation to be in and he handles it pretty well.
1903;I wouldnt say he is William Wallace material or anything, but he gets the job done.
1904;Ed Nortons unaccredited role as the King with Leprocy is fantastic and I really felt for this guy.
1905;He takes it VERY well and this makes you care even more.
1906;who played Saladin was terrific and quite convincing as a master leader and motivator with a heart.
1907;Very well casted and played!The princess Sybollah(sp?)
1908;gets a lot more back.
1909;story and it helps a lot since in the theatrical cut she just shows up out of nowhere and starts sleeping with Balian.
1910;"Now, I know her ""deal"" and appreciate her much more."
1911;the rest of the cast was solid and did themselves well.
1912;This was pretty well acted movie with good characters and character development.
1913;The movie got a bad rap in the box office, but I think this is definately worth watching especially for those interested in that era.
1914;The characters are well thought out and enticing.
1915;One of the better movies I have seen.
1916;The product is as new, just perfect!I am very happy having it ordered from this vendor.
1917;"frankly, the Director's cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is worth to watch and keep in your personal library, not only for the Medieval Ages' cinema fans, but also for those that look for real historic epic films of the Crusades."
1918;"Historically, the movie is very close to real times, scenarios and customs, and shows the ideals and corruption of knights, people, state, and church of both the Christian and the Saracen kingdoms, and the irony of all called ""Holy Wars""."
1919;Kingdom of Heaven is one of the greatest movies ever created, a perfect tale of a French man standing up for his beliefs, King of Jerusalem, Jerusalem and its people during the 2nd Crusade.
1920;Visually its flawless, and the sound is superber.
1921;A good, certainly not great film.
1922;orlando did a good job.
1923;lovely movie, just the fact that people fought ebven then and they still do in the holy land, its just what they fought for then and what they fight for now, in those days, it used to be to upkeep the peace and the sanctity of jerusalem, now its to uproot it, ridley scott does the justice he is known for, i liked the way Liam Neeson played his part, A message we all need is delivered.
1924;"Kingdom of Heaven is one of those films that needs a caveat in the opening sequence: ""Loosely based on events suggested by The Crusades."
1925;but it is still visually impressive, has some quirky performances, manages to send several messages about the importance of symbols and the meaning of honor and courage.
1926;the performances are all strong with the role of the King of the Latin Kingdoms, who has a cancerous skin condition that is slowly killing him, particularly so.
1927;The addional footage makes this a whole new movie.
1928;It explains the ties to Balian and the village better.
1929;The story and the direction is of course good !!
1930;I have to be honest.
1931;The sets were amazing and the storyline was great.
1932;even if your interest in history is not piqued, I still highly recommend this movie.
1933;It is a great movie and deserved to do a lot better in the box office.
1934;I generally think of Orlando Bloom as a wimp except for his exceptional performance in this movie.
1935;The bad guys are also fairly well developed and hatable.
1936;The production is in a class of its own as is the Widescreen arrangement and DTS mix.
1937;bang, and sound well lets just say those extra bits a second really do show.
1938;Pesntch will probably love this since his taste is for bologna.
1939;The movie itself is quite good in many aspects, but could have been a lot better.
1940;Coming out in the summer of 2005, this movie probably had more big name stars in it that most of the summer crop.
1941;Luckily, all the other roles were played well, especially the parts of Saladin and King Baldwin.
1942;"Taking place in what is now Israel, Italy and France, the movie should have been filled with grand scenes of the terrain of these areas
1943;fourth is the action scenes.
1944;These were truly amazing in every respect"
1945;In both movies, Bloom's character starts of as a blacksmith who happens to make swords, and ends up displaying very impressive combat skills.
1946;all in all a good movie and worth the 2.5 hours of watching it.
1947;the extended version is amazing.
1948;Not only is the film excellent, but the extra features are extensive and very interesting.
1949;but it's still one of the best films of 2005, especially if you are looking for an EPIC, SWEEPING TALE, with large scale battles and picturesque scenery.
1950;"The ladies will love ORLANDO BLOOMING on the screen, and guys will appreciate the fact that ORLANDO is a bit ""TOUGHER"" than he was in TROY."
1951;In fact, he really fits the profile of an action hero in this film.
1952;the film will impress, of that, you can be guaranteed.
1953;A fantastic story of self discovery and courage, and an awesomely spectacular battle scene towards the ending will have you glued to the screen.
1954;Pop down to the store, pick it up, and spend 2 hours enjoying the masterful Mr. Scott doing what comes naturally.
1955;Invest in a good history book about the Crusades and let your imagination run wild.
1956;It had a great storyline overall.
1957;The battle scenes were superb and orlando bloom did a perfect job as a portraying a leader of the kingdom towards the end of the movie.
1958;The soundtrack for the movie however didnt keep my attention at its best.
1959;But overall it was a great movie.
1960;An excellent Action film with a good Story during the Crusades from the Point of view of a Young man going to the holy land for redemption.
1961;*blows raspberry*Obviously i loved the film, great acting, great effects, and great settings.
1962;Great a lot of things.
1963;the director and writer wanted a thrilling story that gets and keeps your attention, and i am glad they took the creative license because it is exactly thee movie i want it to be.
1964;i hope you enjoyed t too.
1965;This movie truly brought out the essence of what a true knight/warrior should be.
1966;The tone of the film is greatly enhanced because its main character isn't particularly religious, and the film dissuades the viewer from taking sides, creating no demonized enemy, but rather a mesh of human beings being humans.
1967;He has only one or two expressions throughout the entire film, and he is completely surrounded by great actors who make him look silly.
1968;I have yet to see a convincing performance by Bloom and cannot understand why he is so popular.
1969;the romance is completely copied and pasted.
1970;It tells a familiar tale, but I will admit that the timeliness of the film is at least interesting.
1971;All the actors, especially Alexander Siddig, were great as well.
1972;the 4 Disc Director's Cut was fascinating, I have read a good deal of Crusades history and really enjoyed Ridley Scott's retelling.
1973;The deleted scenes enlarged the telling, the Queens relationship with her son made a great deal of historical sense.
1974;I also liked the little documentaries.
1975;So, for me, it was worth the price.
1976;This is an awesome historical event to capture in a major movie, but oh, how Orlando Bloom doesn't belong.
1977;And the rest of the cast is brilliant.
1978;I really enjoyed the movie.
1979;There was a great deal of action and character development.
1980;The cinematography was also excellent.
1981;all very well regarded actors who played important roles in the film.
1982;"This is defiantly no ""Gladiator"" but it's pretty good over all."
1983;Even so, there are a couple of really cool (if slightly clich ) scenes.
1984;After viewing this version I saw that it was a good movie so I ordered the director's cut.
1985;It is now in one of my top 6 fav movies of all time.
1986;Yes, this movie is a morality play, but it is an excellent morality play.
1987;Balian is the essence of the true knight incarnate.
1988;be brave and upright that God may love thee.
1989;"For ""A King may move a man, a father may claim a son, but remember that even when those who move you be Kings, or men of power, your soul is in your keeping alone."
1990;Yes, this is a morality play, but when is the last time you saw true morality exalted anywhere, even in a play?
1991;I found it both refreshing and inspiring.
1992;ray, the costumes jump right out, especially the lepers mask, the sets and structers look like you're really there, and the sound like I said is just so superior, if you have a blu.
1993;Excellent Ridley Scott historical piece, and for those interested in events of the 3rd Crusade this is certainly a worthwhile effort.
1994;the background of Balian of Ibelin has been fictionalized, but the historical tech is excellent, as well the portrayals of key historicfigures.
1995;Scott is a master behind the camera and this film is no exception.
1996;winning still image (or classic painting.)
1997;The Director's Cut is far superior to the original version, in that it fills in many of the holes in the story line.
1998;Rydly Scott generally directs films that are always beautiful to look at, with detailed and interesting historical contexts and dramatic panoramas.
1999;Orlando Bloom does a credible job and most of the supporting cast is exceptional.
2000;Jeremy Irons and Liam Nilson, after good performances, stumble out of the film incongruously and create an imbalance in the flow of the story.
2001;it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it has its share of enjoyable scenes.
2002;I just read the most recent review and realized I viewed the theatrical version (which i still found stunning).
2003;Balian and Sarisan are real figures from real history, for those who are interested.
2004;The pacing is good, i agree the theatrical version could use more character development so i look forward to the directors cut, but still bears the Ridley Scott stamp of reaching into your gut and pulling them out to stamp on an ethical message.
2005;The movie actually makes sense now.
2006;Incredible as it may seem, Ridley Scott actually had a better film than what was initially released.
2007;KOH is about as interesting as watching paint set.
2008;Phrases about religion and tolerance abound in the film, and this is welcomed.
2009;As in history, Saladin and the king are the most memorable characters here.
2010;It is a film of spectacle, as well as a political allegory.
2011;"If Balian is to accomplish this feat
2012;acting and Cinematography:The acting was very convincing by the entire cast and from the supporting actors involved.
2013;The set locations were visually awing and become the focal point of making this film a three hour journey of pure """"eye."""
2014;There are gorgeous landscapes and impressive costume designs that appear to be true/accurate to the time period.
2015;"As an example
2016;Plot pacing and character development is improved ten.
2017;Scenes that did not seem to make much sense can now easily be understood with great clarity.
2018;This film and its story are truly epic in scale and vision.
2019;I was immediately glued to my seat the entire time and was on more than several occasions uttering the word """"wow""""."""
2020;rate effects, gorgeous production design, and iconic, but there's just something missing.
2021;jeremy Irons was perhaps the best player in the story.
2022;As the faithful general and servent to the King of Jerusalem his supporting role really adds to the feel of the film.
2023;I really enjoy this movie and it was a great adventure to watch.
2024;The movie does a great job of duplicating the excitment the Crusades must have engendered.
2025;"It is, in fact, a ""nachtmare."""
2026;just please, please, please . . . do NOT think this is in any way actual history, or any sort of fair to middling approximation thereof.
2027;Orlando Bloom proves how pretty he is even when covered in dirt.
2028;He's actually the prettiest person in the movie.
2029;Even a step above all the female roles.
2030;This is a very good movie, if you like stories that take place around the crusades.
2031;Therefore, let me prime this by saying that the Director's Cut is far superior to the original Theatrical Version, and although I still have some reservations towards Kingdom of Heaven (KOH), if you are going to watch this film the Director's cut is the way to go.
2032;As well as the additional footage, the documentaries and featurettes are worth watching if you are interested in the film or in the filmmaking process.
2033;If you are interested in learning more about this, Wikipedia has a pretty decent rundown of the inaccuracies.
2034;conversely, when it comes to the Islamic religion an extreme amount of respect and reverence are offered by Ridley and his team.
2035;Furthermore, Ridley gives Muslim prayer plenty of face time in the film, and even shoots the Christians jealously looking on .
2036;furthermore, the additional documentary footage reveals much about Ridley's view of the Islamic religion.
2037;"For instance, he remarks during one interview that he wants to portray religion with as much respect and reverence as possible, and he clarifies, ""especially the Islamic religion."""
2038;Actually, the grandiose scale of the sets and costumes really makes the film worth watching.
2039;If anything, one can get a good idea of the feel of medieval times just from the costumes and sets.
2040;It's worth the time to watch the Featurettes with Janty Yates, as she provides insight into the huge effort involved in creating the numerous costumes for this epic.
2041;Furthermore, the weapon design team did a fabulous job, one step below Lord of the Rings but awesome non.
2042;special Effects:Again, compared to Lord of the Rings, Kingdom of Heaven is a notch below, but for technical battle scenes and vast armies it is still utterly impressive.
2043;I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great action sequences, as KOH offers plenty of eye candy.
2044;score:The score, written and conducted by Harry Gregson.
2045;williams, is both fitting and enchanting.
2046;The music certainly outweighed the theatrical release, but with the Director's cut it seems to blend well.
2047;It is probably one of the bigger flops in Hollywood history, especially considering that Ridley Scott is one of the most highly acclaimed action directors of our times.
2048;There is a 30 minute presentation by Ridley and team in the Director's Cut package that dialogues the numerous failings of the theatrical release, and it is well worth watching as the team offers invaluable insight into the disappointment and propriety involved in marketing and cutting Hollywood movies.
2049;oh well, better luck next time Ridley!
2050;This movie was recommended to me by a friend who is a staunch evangelical so I was expecting to see a lot of Bible speak!
2051;Turns out to be an action packed movie presenting us with a glimpse into the genesis of today's religious conflicts.
2052;Enjoyed every bit of it.
2053;"but the real hero is the ever ""Enlightened Pagan"" or, at best, the supremely ""Syncretistic Pelagian,"" who shows us that ""real"" men don't really need the useless trappings of the Church."
2054;or religion, for that matter.
2055;"in order to become ""real, good"" men."
2056;will be a far, far better place for you and for me and for everyone else.
2057;"It's the gateway to heaven!"""
2058;Your willful ignorance is their obscene bliss.
2059;"artistically, what we should be talking about the movie is excellent
2060;Has great acting and a true story line unlike a lot of junk you see today.
2061;In short if you haven't seen it pick it up and you will love it as well
2062;the music is exceptional and haunting.
2063;Some great acting, although if I could criticise anything I would say that Orlando Bloom was a bit too young for the part he played.
2064;i thought it was more than fair to both sides in the conflict, unusally so.
2065;Wow, director's cut is epic.
2066;IT fills in a lot of the back.
2067;if you like the movie, the director's cut is definitely worth checking out.
2068;the score was compelling and totally fitting for the mood(Harry.
2069;moral obligation(Bloom's character is driven by an honest desire to do right.
2070;great battle sequences(Although there is violence to spare,the viewer is often spared the vision of beheadings,goring,and carnage in great detail,although there is quite a bit of blood.
2071;the battles themselves are brilliant with stunning choreography and a general understanding of war tactics.
2072;the love story(Bloom's character refrains from taking the woman he loves as his own because she is married and a queen.
2073;there is only one brief scene of """"love"""" between them which is good."""
2074;his personal developement is gripping,too).
2075;the things that I didn't like were early in the movie and soon dealt with(rapid progression and unrealistic circumstances),so I enjoyed the movie quite well.
2076;entertaining and enlightening,this movie is a really good one.
2077;it is a bit long and may take patience to finish it,but it is worth watching.
2078;Despite that this movie is better viewed in the cinema, the second dic with the extra features are exemplary in this instance.
2079;There are two substantial documentaries that allow the viewers to understand deeper about the Crusades, comparing the facts against the fiction, getting a glimpse of the thoughts and reflections of the actors and actresses, planning process, production process and so forth.
2080;The gesture of Salahuddin picking up a fallen cross and putting it right on the table mindfully is a very potent symbol of his respect and tolerance of other religion.
2081;The movie brings forth a point that some people use religion for the greater good and some people hide behind the facade or religion to garner power and influence.
2082;It's quite remarkable that one of the Ten Commandments is Thou Shall Not Kill and yet, people can't still abide by TEN simple Commandments.
2083;A memorable movie that anyone should have in their collections.
2084;then twice, and I'll be watching it again and again.
2085;I was greatly impressed with each character.
2086;Each one of them brought a special link to the movie to form the perfect chain of characters.
2087;"I loved all the ""epic grandeur"" of the movie, but if you are going to make a war movie, make the sides seem more even, or have some kind of complexity or even moral ambiguity to them both."
2088;This isn't some kind of children's book, this is an enormous production and worthy of more thought!
2089;Were all Muslims such humane and philosophical wizards?
2090;Someone else will be able to come along later and tell a much more interesting and believable story, using REAL motives for that time period's characters, and do it without such an enormous heap of anti.
2091;from faith to familial love to honor.
2092;He manages to tell several stories without gratituous battle or sex scenes.
2093;The spectacular Moroccan backdrop, opulent sets and costumes support the ambience which could easily have been lost in a wash of Hollywood.
2094;turning in a quiet, well.
2095;paced but intense portrayal of what, on the surface, appears to be a uncomplicated character.
2096;adequate marketing finesse, is definitely a must.
2097;see for devotees of a classic epic.
2098;"being of a Greek origin this movie ""Kingdom of Heavens"" and Ridley Scott as its Director reminds me of another movie ""Aliens"" that introduced a new lifeform totally alien to the man yet one that breeds within a human host and kills him when it's coming to life."
2099;my prayer today is that people of this epic film will take history as their only guide, and not their pleasure and entertainment.
2100;Actually, it is easy to believe.
2101;Ridley Scott coughs up the same visually spectacular but morally ambiguous and substance.
2102;The theology presented is inaccurate for both sides.
2103;But, the armies and the way of fighting captivated me.
2104;The battle over Jerusalem is nearly historically accurate.
2105;Ridley Scott is a brilliant artist, and this feature gives a wonderful look into his filmmaking mind.
2106;From the detailed historical features, to the Ridleygrams, there is a virtual smorgasbord of interesting and informative special features.
2107;This is a perfect gift for a budding historian, filmmakers, artist, and or actor.
2108;it is, but any questions raised, and left unanswered, the first time 'round are all very neatly, and beautifully answered, by the director's cut.
2109;beautifully executed, with great skill, and craftsmanship.
2110;i've got a personal interest in the history of the Middle East and Jerusalem.
2111;up visual / cinematographic job of recreating a 12th century Jerusalem and outlining the intrigue between the King, the Knights Templar, the church, and the enemies (internal and external) of the Crusaders.
2112;Scott also nails the grand themes of the Crusades .
2113;After we viewed it once, we then saw the Pilgrim Notes, so we turned them on an watched it again.
2114;It actually takes ablout 3 nights to watch it all, but by doing this, you will have a much better understanding of this time in history and how it ties into present day issues in Israel and other parts of the Middle East.
2115;The movie with the Director's Cut is excellent and I'd recommend that version and would advise anyone not to waste their money on the original version.
2116;That film was a surprisingly accurate portrayal of events leading to the reconquest of Jerusalem by Islamic forces in 1187, which triggered the Second Crusade.
2117;It was a time of extraordinary events and persons .
2118;the Director's Cut reinserts 50 minutes of narrative and character exploration!
2119;featuring the eerily appropriate musical score of Harry Gregson.
2120;Of special note is a greater understanding of Neeson's character, and the exploration of Balian's crisis of faith .
2121;this is the masterpiece envisioned by Scott!
2122;even if you have a hard time with names and politics (as I often do) you'll still enjoy this movie.
2123;and a strong cast keeps it going even better.
2124;Kingdom of Heaven is the story of a French ironworker in early 12th century Europe who heads to the Levant to find redemption.
2125;But its almost impossible not to be impressed and intrigued with what we see in the story.
2126;It's a story that makes us think, and it's also a story that helps us learn a critical piece of history.
2127;It's a story that entertains.
2128;It's a grand work made accessible to nearly anyone.
2129;kingdom of Heaven is a panoramic epic, eminently suited to the enlarged vistas of the super wide screen.
2130;It shows its best with huge, wide landscapes of cities, troops, and landscapes, and proceeds to fill them with color, detail, and power.
2131;It is a lushly filmed piece that finds its best home in the Blu.
2132;ray format, which alone to date is able to present in the home setting the original intent of the film's look.
2133;It is gorgeous to view, with so much detail and visual activity in each scene that it will take multiple viewings to take it all in.
2134;There are few films that are as visually beautiful as this one.
2135;This means that, if you have a home studio system, you will experience a superior audio presentation, but even two channel (stereo) systems will provide a much more clear and powerful soundtrack.
2136;This is a good thing, because the musical composition of the piece is hauntingly beautiful.
2137;It's a multimedia experience when coupled with the high definition video of Blu.
2138;of course, directing and acting in the movie is first rate.
2139;an amazing work on virtually any measure, learn some history while enjoying the story.
2140;It's so much more an epic tale now, more powerful, more tearjerking, far more thought provoking and something I'm sure the cast and director Scott wished for to begin with.
2141;3 hour plus films are rare in theatre's.
2142;see it as it was intended.
2143;Fantastic film here, see it!
2144;As the title states, great action and a pretty good story.
2145;The dirctor's cut is long at 3 hours but it goes by pretty well.
2146;This movie is a good historical reference for what is occuring in the middle east at this time.
2147;Making a film about the crusades against the backdrop of the War on Terror was always going to be a delicate business.
2148;Ridley Scott got away with sacrificing history to entertainment in Gladiator because that film didn't ask viewers to believe they were watching the real thing.
2149;Kingdom of Heaven does, parading a Hollywood plot construction as fact and inevitably offending a great many people given the sensitivity of the subject matter.
2150;such historical gymnastics reveal Scott's misconception of the task facing him.
2151;Scott makes some concessions to history, including wild.
2152;orientalist portrayal, passing up the chance to explore the complexities of this brilliant Kurdish warrior statesman.
2153;"It is not void of redeeming qualities
2154;king Baldwin evokes genuine pathos.
2155;i would recommend this to any one who likes to watch time period movies
2156;i found the movie well worth watching, and would like to remind others, that if you want the whole story as told in History books, don't look for it in a movie, go to more reliable sources.
2157;I thought this movie was very interesting.
2158;I think the intended message behind this was you will find fanactics or idiots everywhere, however you will also find good people as well.
2159;There were many historical inaccuracies, however I enjoyed the movie as a movie.
2160;If you go to see this movie watch it as a movie not as a documentary.
2161;First and foremost, I enjoyed the original theatrical release, but once I saw the Director's Cut, I saw the epic that was intended, and it was good.
2162;Thus, the environments are more realistic and it really puts you in the world as you follow Balian's journey.
2163;so, in a nutshell, Blu Ray is worth it.
2164;Because the incredible extra features from the 4.
2165;disc Director's Cut version of the movie.
2166;It may feel like double dipping, but each provides a unique viewing experience that I believe to be more than worth it.
2167;Great cast, good performance, and a renown director in Ridley Scott who is famous for directing battle films, scored a great success in this one.
2168;ray restoration was excellent and it's really worthwhile to regain if you like the ancient epic battle movies.
2169;Vastly superior to the truncated theatrical release, whose edits compromised plot and characters.
2170;Even includes an overture and intermission music.
2171;It presents you with a lot of great scenes, shots, battles and with an impartial view of the conflict involving east and west, religion and insanity.
2172;It is a spectacle with fantastic and realistic battle scenes and portrays events as they were.
2173;Take a look at this version and see!
2174;The film is 45 minutes longer but it's worth it.
2175;It is not 45 minutes of dull scenes, but it makes the film more interesting.
2176;The correct term for these times is called the middle ages.
2177;centric way of viewing the world and it's history, as I was surprised to learn that Americans mostly stayed away from the theaters when this originally came out I felt the movie provided a very balanced telling of the story that did not overly villify one side or another but sought to explore the roots of a conflict that plagues the Human Race this very day.
2178;I give this version of this film my very highest reccomendation!
2179;The directors cut is 100% better and ties the whole story together.
2180;played good, no complaintshave yet to check out the special features but this version really good, it is a lot better movie than i originally thought it would be.
2181;Where AN was Russian """"Big Slavic Brother"""" nationalism via the Soviets, this movie is the last great gasp of politically."""
2182;But take anybody who gives this 4 or 5 stars a serious look.
2183;good action movie about the end of the crusade to the holy lands.
2184;The extra content in the directors cut makes this a much better film.
2185;I felt like I was watching a new movie.
2186;Filmed in the picturesque lands of Spain and Morocco, this is a film about the epic battles for control of the holyland between the Christians and Muslims.
2187;Saladin, legendary muslim commander and field marshal seeks to displace the Christians from Jerusalem, but has made peace with the Christian king.
2188;balian successfully defends Jerusalem, but then surrenders it to save the people.
2189;Sybilla and Balian return to France to start a new life.
2190;bloom is excellent in the role of Balian, though not the womanizer he was in the movie, Troy.
2191;I really love this film.
2192;i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes biblical history or action adventure.
2193;It is a first class production.
2194;The main characters are based on real people with the exception of Balian's father.
2195;this convincing visual recreation of another era catches arguments for both sides and spotlights the self.
2196;the details of siege warfare in the climactic battle for Jerusalem, the huge scale of the confrontation and the fiery catapults are a wonder of modern filmmaking.
2197;everyone I know who has actually seen this impressive film has enjoyed it.
2198;"for more on this relevant theme, read James Reston's terrific book ""Warrior's of God"" and see the superb two."
2199;The shipper did a good job in protecting the product and it arrived in good shape.
2200;Of course I gave it a shot though because I found Orlando Bloom a great Legolas in Lord of the Rings and thought maybe he could carry that magic into this film.
2201;I thought for he to play such a big role he carried it well.
2202;The battle scenes were good, at times the pictures were beautiful, the plot was well done and the actors actually were pretty well played out in their characters.
2203;Although I still consider Lord of the Rings the strongest point in Orlando's acting career, I think he did a good job with this film.
2204;it showed how much he truly can do and this will probably carry him on to even better roles so this is a good step for him.
2205;i recommend this film over many other historic films.
2206;It was edited on studio demands to make the film more palatable for mainstream audiences, on the claims that films in the 3 hour mark were box office poison (LOTR?)
2207;thankfully the Director's Cut clears all this up and the film is restored to the way it should have been originally seen.
2208;This scene has sublime editing and now means so much more.
2209;In addition to its wide.
2210;"ranging battle scenes and handsome production values, Ridley Scott's Medieval epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"" boasts a greater complexity of character and depth of theme than we are accustomed to finding in a film of this type."
2211;Although set in the late 12th Century, the film has a great deal of relevance to the world of today, seeing as how the Christian West and the Muslim East are once again at each others' throats much as they were back then.
2212;"and indeed, it is the sociopolitical parallels that the film draws between its own time and ours that ultimately lifts ""Kingdom of Heaven"" a rung or two above the ordinary."
2213;Ridley Scott isin top form with this thought provoking action film.
2214;A great cast and a great script make this one perfect for the home library.
2215;Happy to see that my order came in before Xmas holiday and I was able to included as a gift to my son.
2216;The movie is base on religion and we serve a good God who dont look at the outward of a man but the heart.
2217;Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.
2218;the villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.
2219;I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.
2220;As an avid reader of the medieval period I was excited to see that Ridley Scott was doing a film based on this subject.
2221;the movie is about the crusades which were religious wars fought over Jerusalem, but its amazing that this movie completely sidesteps attitudes about religion of the timeperiod.
2222;the main theme of the movie seems to be that if you are a good person and do good deeds, then religion really doesn't matter.
2223;"here are the good points
2224;This has to be one of my top movies.
2225;The beginning is great in that Mr. Scott comes up front and explains in short what we are about to see and why the story is what is was supposed to be.
2226;The director thought he was the right person for the job and he's the boss applesauce.
2227;Great editing, and a wonderful soundtrack.
2228;i love the way David Thewlis pops in and out.
2229;Ghassan Massoud is wonderful as Saladin.
2230;This version is an amazing film.
2231;I can verify that the amount of content has certainly increased.
2232;I thought Orlando Bloom's performance was good in the original and I didn't think it was improved even though the backstory explains a little more of his reactions.2.
2233;The people who were responsible for the theatrical cut actually did a good job now that I've seen the director's cut.
2234;Before other reviewers go crazy and exclaim blasphemy, I will say that I liked both equally.
2235;The pace is better and more appropriate to the scope of the story.
2236;This movie also portrays Christians as evil and muslims as good.
2237;In my opinion I thought this was a really good movie, I agree with others in that this movie was unfairly judged at the box office.
2238;i love war/fantasy/historical epics types of movies.
2239;the acting was pretty decent.
2240;Some real good acting came from Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Saladin, David Thewlis, The King of Jerusalem and Brendan Gleeson( He rocked in BraveHeart)The seens are very well done.
2241;but yeah overall the movie is a 4 out of 5.
2242;gladiator was far better, it had a better storyline and better acting and action.
2243;eRNESTO' and rainy ORLANDO and was able to take in the entire 3 hours+ of this RIDLEY SCOTT epic on the plane .
2244;and, I thought GLADIATOR was my favorite movie, but this Director's Edition blows GLADIATOR away by light ages .
2245;There is a deep moral lesson behind this movie.
2246;It is a true story.
2247;Would be a great movie for Christians and Muslims both.
2248;ray technology brings color to an almost colorless (besides the blue of course) world and the details that can be seen in just about everything will not disappoint!A great story as the theatrical version, but an amazing story as it should have been now in the director's version.
2249;ray, The Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut should be the one you choose!
2250;It is worth every penny and then some!!!!!!!
2251;Kingdom of Heaven is my favorite movie for many reasons.
2252;I am a history major, so I look for historical accuracy, and while it is not perfectly accurate historically, it does capture the moment very well.
2253;father to Sibylla's half sister, and Sibylla was actually madly in love with Guy, and a few other historically incorrect relationships and events take place, the major theme is very true historically.
2254;I also love how religeon is handled in this movie and was pleased to see how level.
2255;headed the film makers had remained in their portrayals of Muslims and Christians, creating heros and villians on both sides.
2256;The over all plot is amazing and is a thrill for the senses.
2257;i am very impressed cinematically.
2258;When I saw Kingdom of Heaven in the theater I tough it was a """"Good"""" movie."""
2259;After reading favorable reviews about the Director's Cut I bought it and, well.
2260;It has the soul that the other lacked.
2261;We can see much more about Sybilla which helps us to understand many other things and the beginning of the movie (when Balian is still in his village) finally makes sense.
2262;if you liked Kingdom of Heaven you have to see the Director's Cut.
2263;The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour.
2264;Thus, this film remains together with Aliens, pure fiction.
2265;meaning directors of their own crimes, much like KG children steal a chocolate bar and claim the rightful owner is the thief!
2266;I'm not sure how Ridley Scott could've put that in a positive light.
2267;The director's cut is much more fulfilling that the theatrical version.
2268;It is one of my favorite movies with a great story .
2269;although the character in the movie is very fictional when compared to the real Balian of Ibiled, the version that appears in the movie is still very interesting.
2270;regardless, its otherwise exceptional, and you seem to get a good understanding about the atmosphere of 12th century Levant and how the events of such led to the falling of the crusader state.
2271;There is quite a bit of politics, both in Jerusalem itself and in Saladin's army and court.
2272;The politics are quite interesting in themselves.
2273;The characters that you meet throughout this movie and these troubles are very interesting, if their parts small overall in the movie.
2274;"There is plenty of it, throughout the movie
2275;The Siege of Jerusalem is also well done"
2276;all in all, both in the fiction and the reality, its an excellent show, and I highly reccomend it.
2277;the historical Balian was not from France but born in Syria to an already established noble family.
2278;raymond of Tripoli is one of the great heros in the film.
2279;saladin, portrayed as a peace loving hero in the film, was nothing of the sort.
2280;Having seen part of this movie on satellite, I knew was a winner.
2281;This movie slipped by the public, more than likely because of its violence, but I found it was quite good, supurb cast and storyline, and what I consider a really well done script.
2282;This is a great film that will age well.
2283;In one respect it soars above most military and historical epics.
2284;Scott elevates the ideas of selflessness and defense of the innocent to the controlling ideas of the film.
2285;His counterpart among the Jerusalem Christians is the character Tiberias, the king's military commander, portrayed well by Jeremy Irons.
2286;His laconic humility fits the script well.
2287;In my opinion Balian's words are better, certainly more profound if not more poetic, and the humbleness of his character is key to his message.
2288;the film is loaded with fine acting.
2289;I really enjoyed the theatrical cut, and now, get ready for all the nice storylines that were deleted.
2290;So much more work is put into the establishment of Balian's character that by the time we actually meet him in the film now, we have a sense of who he is.
2291;He flashes back to when he was younger, to when he was with Balian's mother, and that one moment says all we need to know about the particular paradise that Godfrey seeks and that he knows he'll never find again.
2292;He's looking for absolution, and he figures he can find it this way, and the film shows us instead of just telling us.
2293;Balian also fights a climactic duel with Guy.
2294;ray is a magnificent release and I would highly recommend it to anyone that had the slightest interest on the theatrical release.
2295;With this cut, Scott has a masterpiece.
2296;Does it sound like a liked this version?
2297;R. Scott's director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven is much better than the film we saw in the theater.
2298;enjoying this movie a great deal!
2299;It can't give you a comprehensive knowledge of that period but it does introduce you to a few of the names and places of that period.
2300;My boyfriend loves this movie so I gave it to him as a gift!The price was great and he now wants me to find other movies for him!
2301;This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day and w/ company.
2302;It makes for a great conversation piece.
2303;It's really interesting and keeps you on the move while watching.
2304;Great historic/ romantic and action packed film.
2305;It's definitely eye candy, with spectacular scenes of massed armies and trebuchets hurling fireballs.
2306;When you take all this away, you have two or three decent performances, some lovely costumes, and a reasonably accurate sketch of the events leading up to the Third Crusade.
2307;Nonetheless it is far too reliant on cheap effects, and pays far too little attention to characterization, to be a great film.
2308;"I don't know who the ""powers that be"" that control the final cut of these movies are, but they really messed this movie up completely."
2309;I am an enthusiastic movie watcher.
2310;This authentic look at the early Hospitalers (Catholic Knights of Malta)during the Crusades and presents a very good life ethic for men.
2311;`Kingdom of Heaven' is an epic tale set during the Crusades and whilst this is rife with historical inaccuracies, it is also a fairly decent story of one man finding some peace and meaning in his life.
2312;Bloom plays the main character (Balian) and he manages to play the role reasonably well, although he doesn't seem to have enough grit at times.
2313;For all that, this is still a perfectly enjoyable film and once you settle into it's rhythm you can truly appreciate it for it's epic scope.
2314;The director's cut edition of Kingdom of Heaven gives this film its justice it so rightly deserved when it first came on the big screen.
2315;life characters that shared our world around a thousand years ago, but we learned about humanity and frame of thought way back when.
2316;Granted, this movie is not a completely accurate factual representation of characters and events, but it is factual in the sense that it tells us how we lived, how we loved, and what we believed in.
2317;A sign of a great movie is when you no longer think of Russell Crowe or Joaquin Phoenix as playing Maximus and Commodus respectfully, but when you think you are actually watching a Roman gladiator and actually watching a Roman Emperor duel it out for control of Rome.
2318;These great depictions of these type of characters is what Ridley Scott brings to Kingdom of Heaven.
2319;What was even better about the acting this time around is that not all the characters in this movie are as overhyped and well.
2320;All these other images and thoughts of Norton in his other roles came into my head.
2321;But that's the magic of it all.
2322;I don't want to go into great detail on all the characters, but it's the smaller characters of this movie that really sell this film as a great film.
2323;His claim to fame is his great acting in the Harry Potter films, yet these small scenes in which he was in, really make the viewer understand the film's message, his character's message.
2324;"The line ""What god desires is here (points to Balian's head) and here (points to Balian's heart)."
2325;And what you decide to do every day will make you a good man.
2326;While the writing was weak in some parts, mainly the ending of the film, the dialogue between the characters was superbly fitting for the time.
2327;I know zero about Crusade or Templar history but I was amazed by the profound opinions and perceptions of religions in this great movie.
2328;Without taking sides, it presents motivations and souls of both Christian and Muslim in the battle to possess Jerusalem, The Holy city.
2329;It brings up the question What is God to men in the Holy Land and What is religion anyway.
2330;I Absolutely recommend this movie.
2331;It is long but completely worth every minute.
2332;The directors cut of Kingdom of Heaven is simply amazing.
2333;Ridley Scott created a master piece that was sadley too long for theaters.
2334;If you liked the theater release of kingdom of heaven then you will love the directors cut which is ten times better.
2335;star casts, Ridley Scott handles it with amazing cinematic dexterity and visual grace.
2336;From the opening scene, you know you are in good hands.
2337;Amazing blue hues, the peaceful presence of snowflakes, and authentic costumes throw you into the world of the story.
2338;orlando Bloom plays Balian, with much improved acting skill due largely in part to Ridley Scott's directing, and the ultra.
2339;He joins a heavyweight cast of Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, and David Thewlis.
2340;Any scene that he finds himself in with these three guys, are probably the best of the movie.
2341;In any event, the sooner you suspend your disbelief that the skinny Orlando can take on vicious foreign fighters and master swordsmen, the easier it will be to enjoy the movie.
2342;what drives this movie, is the incredible adventure that Balian embarks on.
2343;But when these fights occur, they are all too surreal, visually breathtaking, and far more corrupt than any battles that i have seen in a film before.
2344;When an outnumbered band of Ibelin knights rush the oncoming Muslim tide of cavalry, the screams, the blood, the dirt, and the death portrayed is vicious and beautiful.
2345;And while visually impressive, the siege of Jerusalem may not sit well with some people.
2346;in the end, Kingdom of Heaven will draw you back to the glorious days of the epic when story was more important than battles.
2347;This movie is worth the watch!
2348;One of the best movies out there that represents it's time line.
2349;I'm a huge fan of historical dramas, especially when the filmmaker has the vision and budget to really capture the look, feel and spectacle of past events.
2350;this director knows how to manage big budgets, big sets and action scenes involving casts of thousands and get it onto the screen.
2351;Scott is a superb technical film maker and an intelligent guy.
2352;orlando Bloom, as Balian of Ibelin, is just fine in the lead role, as are the majority of others cast in the film.
2353;The Muslim actor who portrays Saladin gives a particularly noteworthy and fairly accurate account of this historical figure.
2354;Monahan finally settles down and produces some moments of clarity when Balian arrives in the Holy Land.
2355;The leper king is gentle, wise and always diplomatic, to the point where it seems he's been sedated throughout Monahan's script.
2356;to speak to the divisive nature that religion sparks in humanity and to question how theology, greed and power can corrupt peaceful cooperation.
2357;hey, the boxed set does contain a nifty full length documentary about the making of Kingdom of Heaven which is really enjoyable for fans of cinema .
2358;showing how tens of millions of dollars are spent to bring an epic to the screen, department by department.
2359;That was a fun bonus.
2360;as far as the movie goes, I really enjoyed it.
2361;ray discs I own are actually.
2362;This is easily the best authored of all the MPEG.2 discs I own.
2363;There are instances of film grain in things such as the sky, but this is minimal and given it's film origins, is acceptable for me at least.
2364;Colors are vibrant and gorgeous.
2365;When I saw this movie for the first time un cut it was fantastic.
2366;The story is much more complex and makes much more sense.
2367;I am a history teacher and though I was aware historians were crying foul of the inaccuracies (and I noticed a good amount in the film) but despite these, I was very pleased with it.
2368;I have to say that I tremendously admire Ridley Scott and the cast for making this film in these turbulent times.
2369;Yes my friends for that moment CHIVALRY was ALIVE!
2370;"Nonetheless, the moment of chivalry at the end cemented my positive review of the film
2371;And because I am such an extreme moderate and as a teacher, one who emphasizes coexistence, the historical inaccuracies were fine for me to deal with.
2372;If you know the history and watch this film, it truly has the chance to inspire us all.
2373;A masterpiece, a beautiful display of the struggle for a land that all lay claim to .
2374;When Ridley Scott goes to make a film, he always seems to have a clear view in mind.
2375;notch visual effects, some good performances, and superb battle scenes.
2376;Now, instead of a good action.
2377;epic, we get a film more on the lines of """"Gladiator:"""" a character."""
2378;driven historical epic, with fine performances by the main stars.
2379;I believe that if Scott had been allowed to release this version in the theaters, a great number of the cast and crew would've been up for Oscars.
2380;The special features are also fascinating, giving insight into the making of this epic film, and the reasons why it may have failed here in the states.
2381;"overall, this version of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a masterpiece of film that ranks with films like ""Gladiator,"" ""Alexander,"" and ""Braveheart"" as one of the greatest historical epics of our time."
2382;it was everything I wanted to see in a good crusader movie.
2383;"except for:""Overture""Beautiful, perfect intro to the movie."
2384;I closed my eyes and waited for the start of the film.
2385;20th century fox fanfare and studio logo crap!Not good.
2386;when the wall is breeched at the end of the siege and both armies swarm the opening, the seething mass of fighting men who clog the breech is a perfectly realized moment.
2387;I was surprised when the camera pulled up to an overhead shot and saw that both armies were holding back while the breech was contested by smaller contingents.
2388;now the only complaint I have about the movie is one that is really a compliment to the director:Godfrey and his knights: I understand that Ridley enjoys the fact that we are surprised that many of them die so soon.
2389;I want to see another movie with more of him.
2390;one other little thing:The fight on the beach.
2391;I always thought the movie was sort of ho.
2392;It's quite spectacular and the characters are much, much more developed which makes the character's motivations and actions a lot more credible.
2393;The cinematography was fabulously done, costuming, acting WOW and general plot line was riveting.

2395;The intensity of awe inspiring beauty, the bling.
2396;The Church's faade represents paradise of Heaven the power of God.
2397;Lovely movie to watch and shared.
2398;Kingdom of Heaven is about one man's dedication to be the perfect knight in order to protect the innocent civilians of Jerusalem.
2399;In the end he gives up the city of Jerusalem to save its inhabitants.
2400;The knight, aside from the justified murder at the beginning of the film, doesn't go through much of an arc: he is good near the beginning and stays good to the end.
2401;some ways that might have made it better: cut the entire first act prior to his arrival in Jerusalem, yes including his dad Liam Neeson so the main story gets going right away.
2402;This is the 3 hour+ version that adds 45 minutes onto the original film.
2403;here's what I thought of it: Wow.
2404;the movie is completely redeemed and now succeeds in ways that it didn't before.
2405;Much of those 45 minutes adds bulk to the movie, placing Balian in greater context with the situation at hand and his own fractured frame of mind.
2406;but they've redeemed Orlando in this.
2407;Some of his best lines have been added to and given additional weight because now we know what lies behind them.
2408;He's a vastly more intriguing and stronger character even as he feels as one player in all this and not the only player.
2409;additional scenes are added that give greater depth to all the major characters.
2410;It's a terrific female lead and a fascinating character.
2411;She's so much *more* than before.
2412;The whole sequence is bulked up and enriched.
2413;"minor characters blossom into something quite memorable even as more moments of ""art"" are added."
2414;The film is much more evocative and has visual metaphors that it didn't before.
2415;"Many more ""Ridley Scott"" moments of pure visual magic."
2416;Those moments are simply stunning.
2417;to be sure, the heart and soul of the film was ripped out in the first version.
2418;This director's cut is a terrific redo of the movie and turns KoH into one of Ridley's most complex, epic films.
2419;I absolutely recommend this version.
2420;the Director's Cut of KoH is one of the best movies of 2005 and shoots into the top 3 on my list.

2425;i enjoyed the movie sooooo much.
2426;This is one of my favorite movies.
2427;I gave it as a gift and the giftees love it.
2428;It has plenty of action and plenty of depth.
2429;the scenes of old Jerusalem were very much like those of Rome (albeit equally spectacular!)
2430;Orlando Bloom did a reasonably good job with the lead .
2431;he doesn't have quite the gravitas he needs to make the big speeches before a battle, but other than that he did a fine job (and I gotta admit, he looks even better than Russell in those period clothes!)
2432;Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons were both excellent, as usual.
2433;But I never got as emotionally involved with the characters as with Maximus .
2434;the story jumps from spectacular scene to spectacular scene without enough tying it all together.
2435;Ridley, you've got the scenery, costumes and special effects down .
2436;Bought it as a gift.
2437;Look, I love the film production values .
2438;but it manages to charm and gets away with it if you can only suspend that disbelief long enough.
2439;"What a difference 45 minutes of extra footage makes!As a fan of the great historical epics such as ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"", I had high hopes for this film when it was released in the theaters."
2440;This film is so vastly improved by the added material that it is difficult to believe I was watching the same movie.
2441;"Overall, I have a huge interest in ""historical"" movies."
2442;I would recommend this movie based on the cast alone, but there is also much merit in the film.
2443;"making that makes ""Kingdom"" worth owning."
2444;'Kingdom of Heaven' is a great movie as it leaves you off your seat.
2445;Also, if you like action it is the perfect movie for you.
2446;Even going so far as saying this is one of Ridley Scotts best works in a while.
2447;This extended version of Kingdom of Heaven is a much deeper experience.
2448;Also this is alot more historically accurate, portraying the people and the times the way it should have been.
2449;This is definitely the definitive edition of this film, and to me the original is just a trailer.
2450;Plus, as a muslim, it is an excellent feeling to see one of our greatest and fairest leaders in history portrayed in the right manner, as a just loving person who taught his people how to respect all religions, especially that of christianity and judaism for they were all the same religion in the end under the same god.
2451;Entertaining, emotional, and highly political, I recomend this film to all.
2452;I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.
2453;The actors were absolutely wonderful.
2454;The dramatization of the history, and the characters was absolutely superb.
2455;This is our favorite movie of all time and the director's cut is incredible, it adds volumes more to the movie
2456;Most of the acting is great in this film except for the lead actor Orlando Bloom.
2457;For those of us fascinated with the Crusades and the Holy Land this is a gift from Heaven (pardon the pun).
2458;If you wonder how the middle east situation came about, this movie will give you some background to build on.
2459;Treat yourself to a fascinating movie!
2460;It was actually very entertaining, which is the director's intention.
2461;I'm a Medieval History buff myself with particular interest in the Crusades, and I (like some of you) could go on about this film's historical inaccuracies.
2462;as to the film itself, I viewed for what it is and enjoyed it very much.
2463;Absolutely one of my most favorite movies to watch which tells the story of how Jerusalem was taken over by the Muslims.
2464;Very well put together and I can watch this movie over and over again.
2465;The music selection goes is perfect for the movie also.
2466;He's watched it so much, I may need to order another one!
2467;In addition, there is a bit more attention to Balian's faith journey.
2468;This is one of the few intelligent movies out there, and probably one of only three 'intelligent' epics, the others being SPARTACUS and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.
2469;By intelligent I'm referring to an extremely literate script, shades of gray politics within a world of black and white emotions, in this case the christians vs. muslims and vice versa.
2470;This screenplay is extremely well.
2471;grounded in historical fact, like the other two films I mention.
2472;win situation, are also intelligent enough to realize they are locked into a black.
2473;white world they cannot control, as most people function via stark motives, hatreds, and loves.
2474;"Saladin, portrayed here so wonderfully, was really the ""hero"" of the Crusades, being so respected in real life, even Christians in Europe would name their babies for him."
2475;Saladin was the most intelligent and mature of the rulers seeking to (re)claim Jerusalem as the centerpiece holy place of three religions, and he is treated respectfully and accurately, as is Baldwin of Jerusalem.
2476;All of the cast is well.
2477;They both have the requisite look of the period as well as the talent and especially expressive features to convey the characters' thoughts and emotions.
2478;Often the most riveting moments are when caught in close.
2479;They are also both striking looking in coloring, making them a good physical match on.
2480;So, LORD OF THE RINGS still holds the crown for the most complete set of extras ever assembled (a truly exhaustive amount).
2481;This is a fun, bloody exercise in historical fiction.
2482;Good costumes, scenery and action all included in a time we're not accustomed to viewing.
2483;overall, I think the film is decent and I am curious to see what was cut out.
2484;So, my recommendation (take it for what you will)?
2485;Epic historical war films like Gladiator, Troy and now Kingdom of Heaven (just to name a few) are a lot of fun to me.
2486;Ridley Scott does a good job of mixing fictional (Orlando Bloom's Balian) and historical (The leper king, played by Edward Norton in an excellently subdued role).
2487;Complimenting the battle sequences is a rousing score by Harry Gregson.
2488;Overall the sound fits the theme and the time period admirably well.
2489;the story is pretty standard epic film stuff.
2490;You have the unwitting hero, the possible love interest, the possible love interest's evil husband, all engulfed in the massive Crusades that are tearing apart Jerusalem.
2491;One thing I am glad for is that I feel Ridley Scott and screenwriter William Monahan did a more accurate portrayal of the Crusades by showing not only the religious side of events but also the socio.
2492;It's a pretty good epic film.
2493;There were some nice fighting sequences and the final siege of Jerusalem leading up to the climax was stunning.
2494;Personally I enjoyed it much more than Troy and Alexander of last year.
2495;fi since he created Alien and Blade Runner, two films that are superior to this one.
2496;Kingdom of Heaven is a very underrated film so pick it up.
2497;For example, how did Orlando become such a great fighter and know so many military tactics from being a blacksmith his whole life?
2498;the acting was good, definitely not great.
2499;"Orlando did his best in the movie and I really love his ""father"" as an actor but in casting, you'd think they would get father/son actors to look at least a bit more alike??"
2500;Whatever the case, I enjoyed watching Troy and a handful of other movies much more than this.
2501;The story is brilliant and fascinating, the acting (Liam Neeson in particular) is superb, and I felt that Orlando Bloom .
2502;was good enough to carry the film.
2503;a refreshing change for a Hollywood production.
2504;that said, the movie itself is excellent (enough has already been said about its superiority to the theatrical version of this film) and it looks better than ever with this Blu.
2505;A expansive telling of the story of the crusades.
2506;If you are a Christian this movie is a waxte of time, unless you want to experience an excellent example of a Hollywood attack on the Christian faith!
2507;They gloss over the small and intimate moments of the story so that just when you are getting relaxed the movie all of a sudden jerks you somewhere else.
2508;It isn't sloppy per say, I just like movies with a perfect mix of action and simple, intimate moments.
2509;There is also a number of actors and actress you'll recognize.
2510;It is a in the time of kings and queens, good and evil.
2511;a movie with plenty of action.
2512;I like this as it has a number of stories within the movie.
2513;It starts early on and moves along quickly with plenty of action and great characters.
2514;Plenty of wisdom within on top of it all.
2515;A clash of cultures that will entertain you.
2516;It is a long story but like I said, it moves along quickly with plenty of action and impressive visuals.
2517;This is a great story set during the Second Crusade.
2518;And yes, here it is in all its glory, what is widely considered to be the finest director's cut ever made.
2519;"Stacked up against ""Troy"" and ""Alexander,"" Ridley Scott's look at the Crusades holds up the best of the trio."
2520;"Orlando Bloom, who seemed to do little more in ""Troy"" than look like a chick magnet for Helen, has a lot more to do here and carries himself well as the unwilling action hero."
2521;"The battle scenes are terrific (as you would expect from Scott's exceptional ""Gladiator"")."
2522;"what really carries ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" is the supporting cast."
2523;Kingdom Of Heaven is a guy movie, and the fight scenes outweigh the need for female character development.
2524;the moral compass of this movie is also solid.
2525;"one of 2005's best, and I have a feeling ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" will gain in stature as the years pass."
2526;Their knowledge is commendable and their frustration somewhat understandable.
2527;(As far as real history is concerned, both of these gentlemen fared quite well).
2528;There always are some good people about, and this gives a message of hope for humanity.
2529;My son's and I really enjoyed it :) I received it on time and in great condition.
2530;play buff you will thoroughly enjoy this Orlando Bloom / Liam Neeson pic.
2531;This one puts all the pieces back and provides it in high definition.
2532;I enjoyed this movie completely!
2533;The acting was superb, the storyline believable and overall the movie seemed very authentic.
2534;This movie had really nice sets, and a great story.
2535;There is only about 20 minutes of action but overall it's a great movie.
2536;The photography, cinematography, and music are good.
2537;This is a big screen spectacular.
2538;The character with the most charisma is played by Liam Neesom and he does not have that much screen time.
2539;This gave great insights as to the how and why of the movie.
2540;I will enjoy viewing it again later.
2541;Being a history major focusing on medieval and Byzantine studies I really wanted to like the film.
2542;Actually, after studying history what bothered me the most is that EVERY good character had a 21st century concept of reality, freedom, rights and view of the world.
2543;That is all I can say without giving away plot and scenes.
2544;This is a film that belongs in the same conversation as Gladiator or Braveheart.
2545;Ridley Scott and his team came up with a great story using real life characters from the Crusades, and made the best Crusade period film ever off it.
2546;it is to cut up!
2547;tHE DIRECTOR'S CUTKingdom of Heaven was probably my favorite film of last year, and the 194.
2548;minute director's cut gives the film more room to breathe, but it won't make converts of the unbelievers.
2549;Closer in style and tone to sixties roadshows than Scott's Gladiator, and all the better for it, in many ways it's the richest and most ambitious of the recent batch of epics.
2550;The real winner in the extra footage stakes is Eva Green, who I think I'm falling in love with and whose part is considerably expanded and much more complex, allowing her a mass of contradictory motives (few of them noble), impulses and emotions that were smoothed away in the theatrical version.
2551;In fact, in this version of the film, there are even a couple of genuinely touching sequences.
2552;it also now comes with added Bill Paterson, which is rarely a bad thing, especially since his brief scene as a compassionate Bishop establishes the incompatibility of fanatical adherence to religious law with the actions of a loving savior that is one of the film's major themes.
2553;thanks to a strong script this is easily Scott's best film since Blade Runner.
2554;Instead, much of the spectacle is shot for real .
2555;not only is it usually cheaper, but it's certainly a lot more impressive to look at.
2556;The extra features on the 4.
2557;disc set are impressive (or what I've seen of them), including a deeply depressed screenwriter mulling over its US failure.
2558;dISC THEATRICAL CUTKingdom of Heaven turns out to be Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner, largely because for once his visuals are matched with a pretty good script that doesn't feel like an afterthought.
2559;That, and the fact that it's a film about a loser may well be part of the reason for the film's failure to find an audience in America, but it's also one of the things that makes it so interesting.
2560;Even though it's full of historical errors, it does encompass the ebb and flow of a state of mind in a point in history surprisingly well.
2561;dimensional, he does at least manage one.
2562;The supporting cast are mostly on good form, although Edward Norton seems to be doing Anthony Zerbe's leper turn from Papillon as the dying king.
2563;the film was shot largely with real extras for all but the largest crowd scenes, which plays real dividends here.
2564;John Mathieson's photography is infinitely superior to his overpraised work on Gladiator even though he does overdo the dreariness of Europe.
2565;"williams' score is competent, but it's telling that much of the film needed to be scored with several cues from Graeme Revell's Crow, Marco Beltrani's Blade and, most effectively in the ""Rise a knight"" sequence, Jerry Goldsmith's Valhalla prayer from The 13th Warrior ."
2566;Together, they let me see what I believe is the most masterful theatrical edit ever done.
2567;It's absolutely critical to understanding the context and motivation for Guy de Lusignan's machinations and his obsession with marrying Sibylla.
2568;Great movie and nice to see big actors like Liam, Orlando and Jeremy play strong roles with a biblical sense about them
2569;Then, along comes Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a knight and minor noble back from Palestine, who reveals himself as Balian's previously unknown father.
2570;i am very aware that a screenwriter oftentimes has to take creative license to make a period film more interesting.
2571;Baldwin is a good man and has been able to maintain a peaceful existence with the surrounding Muslim nations.
2572;The acting is strong through most of the cast.
2573;the movie has some great action sequences and the cinematography is spectacular.
2574;Great lengths were taken in making detailed weapons and costumes and the siege of Jerusalem is one of the most accurate scenes of siege warfare about an actual real life battle that I have ever seen on screen.
2575;Ridley Scott did a great job of bringing this film together.
2576;Characters that should be written strong, such as Balian, aren't.
2577;kINGDOM OF HEAVEN is a pretty good historical picture.
2578;It's a decent film to introducing people to the Crusades, but it's also just a fun film to watch on a Saturday night.
2579;"kingdom of Heaven"", and a special that aired on A&E
2580;The History Channel companion piece is the better of the two major special features.
2581;The Movie Real feature is anything but real and includes conversations with the actors of the film as if they are real historians.
2582;I liked the theatrical edition, but Scott's extended cut redefines the entire film.
2583;The additional character development makes this film as smart and as moving as it is visually stunning.
2584;In spite of these shortcomings, however, I still enthusiastically rank Kingdom of Heaven as one of my favorite films.
2585;There are some phenomenal scenes to this effect with some great lines, and I found the acting to my liking.
2586;I am sure this film, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven, will gain a growing reputation over the years, and become another Blade Runner, another Scott epic that initially bombed, but later became a cult item, and then a recognized masterpiece.
2587;This is such a shame, since Kingdom of Heaven had so much potential: epic story, good characters, good setting, good director, good composer, good actors (Ed Norton, among others), etc.
2588;The looks of Kingdom of Heaven is just STUNNING, and here Ridley Scott succeeded in what he does best: to create a visual epic.
2589;kingdom of Heaven is a success in this department that makes this movie simply worth watching.
2590;So this movie isn't an entire failure, since the director succeeded in what he is known for.
2591;The attention to visual detail he puts into the making is extremely impressive.
2592;All of this is based on a true story and all characters (except Godfrey of Ibelin played by Liam Neeson) existed in real life.
2593;The dialogues aren't bad, and some are in fact powerful.
2594;This was a good movie and between having to explain the true historical events and plot to my husband I found it ok.
2595;I was upset that Liam Neeson bit it so soon, but I do see how it added to the story.
2596;By far the best movie on this subject matter ever made.
2597;this is the best example this viewer can imagine ever being made on said subject matter.
2598;Probably my new favorite movie.
2599;Orlando Bloom is great, the settings are great and the overall feel of the movie is superb
2600;Its a great story, cinematography is beautiful, music is wonderous and overall, it a pleasure to watch.
2601;i watched this movie as a fairy tale and really enjoyed it.
2602;But this film is simply fantastic.
2603;The scenery is gorgeous, and the entire film is incredibly well.
2604;historical inaccuracies are certainly present, but to a much lesser degree than in many other films that shall not be named.
2605;Definitely one of the best sieges in a film.
2606;Also totally Hollywood in many ways .
2607;Anyone paying attention can clearly see they are simply curious.
2608;Prominent Catholics in the film, such as King Baldwin and Jeremy Irons are peace.
2609;the film is told from a Christian perspective and so shows, quite well, the conflict between Christians.
2610;Not all Christians are good people.
2611;Good people do good things.
2612;That's certainly true, and unfortunate.
2613;Godfrey not being sorry for one sin in his life shows that he is a good man .
2614;As is Baldwin's insistence that he will only confess to God"
2615;Crusaders who knew him in life, that is.
2616;reading books is good for one's mind.)
2617;All in all, fantastic movie that should absolutely not be dismissed as some Christian slam.
2618;Totally understandable, if not entirely historically accurate.
2619;still, I believe everyone with an interest at all in this subject matter should watch the movie, and read some books on the subject .
2620;enjoy it as a Hollywood film, because even if it weren't historical at all, it would still be a damned fine piece of cinema.
2621;The added character development and scenes really made a good film a great film.
2622;Kingdom of Heaven soars so far above our perception of an historical epic that it's not surprising it did poorly at the box office.
2623;there's no denying that this picture is a spectacular achievement.
2624;"His subject is the Christian crusades into the Holy Land (God wills it!"")"
2625;Eva Green is fetching as the king's sister, the fictional love interest and only that.
2626;scott's visuals are stunning: the windy port city of Messina, the entry into Jerusalem, and two battle sequences with sweeping views of opposing armies.
2627;Scott uses weather elements and streaming flags to enliven sequences.
2628;Scott is one of the few large scale directors (David Lean was another) able to make intimate moments between characters as meaningful as magnificent vistas.
2629;"addendeum: A new director's cut of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" extends the narrative by an hour, expanding upon character and incident and accomplishing the rare feat of improving the original."
2630;Whole characters and their story lines are restored, and scenes are enlarged to the scale that Scott intended.
2631;I love this film and have watched it several times.
2632;But I did thoroughly enjoy this movie.
2633;"However, the acting is consistent and strong
2634;Ridley Scott did a very fine job.
2635;What you will expect is a whole new movie that makes sense (sic)?
2636;It was an epiphany for me and my sons to suddenly see this beautiful movie come together in one of the great wide screen spectaculars (as it was meant to be)!
2637;i encourage everyone of the Sir Ridley Scott following to get the """"Director's Cut"""" and enjoy this well made and meaningful movie to it's full extent!"""
2638;this is a great movie, it's only fault was it was released after 911, if 911 had not happened this would have been a block buster of a movie.
2639;I am giving this movie 5 stars based on the photography, the music and the story line.
2640;I think this movie rates as one of the more entertaining era movies.
2641;It shows Saladin in a fair light.
2642;After researching this time era in history it is clear that Saladin was a man of honor.
2643;The movie was filmed well and is picturesque.
2644;The costumes used are good, though others have pointed out that not all costumes are accurate to the time period.
2645;There is plenty of action, in all portions of the movie.
2646;The story line is good, but it is obvious the story is used to make a point.
2647;The sound track is above average.
2648;The movie contains some adult situations, but is tasteful and avoids nudity.
2649;The movie is entertaining and one of a few movies that cover this time period.
2650;It is well worth the time spent to watch it.
2651;It's a dramatized work of fiction.
2652;If you can let that slide and enjoy the film for its story and action, you should be OK.
2653;political and religious themes of Kingdom of Heaven will also draw criticisms from people who zoom in on this content and can concentrate on nothing else.
2654;But it does deliver in violent spectacle, exotic settings and an enjoyable story.
2655;sometimes longer is better particularly when you have a complex story.
2656;"The result was a sprawling ambitious project that had the epic scope of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" without the narrative strength."
2657;Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut restores the material demonstrating that the original 3 hour cut was a brilliant film that played theatrical late last year after the film had bombed at the box office.
2658;Much of the background story is fleshed out and the relationships between the various characters are more clearly defined.
2659;Kingdom of Heaven is a magnificent epic film that recalls the power of David Lean's epics and allows Scott's historical drama to breath.
2660;If you've seen the theatrical cut you owe it to yourself to see this major film from a major talent.
2661;Featuring a beautiful anamorphic transfer this version of the film actually looks superior with less issues with digital artifacts when compared to the previous edition of the film.
2662;The 5.1 audio presentation sounds wonderful with both a 5.1 and 5.1DTS track that makes exceptional use of the format.
2663;You'll feel like you've put plopped down into the middle of the battle sequences in the action sequences and there's wonderful ambient sound effects sprinkled throughout the film even during sequences that are dialogue driven.
2664;special features are terrific in this set.
2665;The second part has cast rehearsals covering everything from the training with the weapons to costume tests.
2666;There's also a section on the visual effects of the film as well as various sound elements to create the unique sound mix of the film presented in various stages.
2667;Great epic style story .
2668;lots of action and great scenery and costumes.
2669;Actors and main actress will keep you interested in the unraveling saga of greed and power struggles.
2670;This movie is one of MY favorites because there is a good message in the movie and I believe Ridley Scott is an under.
2671;Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and it never seems Ridley Scott makes those lists.
2672;the directors cut of this movie is leaps and bounds better than the theatrical version.
2673;It makes so much more sense story wise because there is an aspect of the directors cut (don't want to spoil it) that's not even in the theatrical version.
2674;i found it very interesting!)
2675;I appreciated the creative cinamatography's use of small numbers of actors (extra's) to simulate the large battlefield scenes.
2676;The treatment of both Crusaders and Muslims was probably more generous than in reality, but after all, it is a movie based loosely on historical events with the usual poetic license to dramatize.
2677;what a difference the whole three hours makes in the story of this great movie!It's like watching it for the first time,everything about this epic was more detailed and made sense when watching it with a fresh mind.
2678;it was insightful and helped the viewer to understand the whole of the subject playing out before them.
2679;i could both see myself in this movie and was moved by the story.
2680;so much so in fact that I have memorized the Knight's creed(but that's just the romantic in me!)
2681;the whole of me wanted to be in the middle of the action!To fight alongside Balian,defend the city and the fair maidens.
2682;this movie also helps in understanding the differences between the two faiths and hopefully coming to a meeting point in the future.
2683;great action and again great story,this movie has it all!Mr.
2684;this movie helped me to realize that boyhood dream.
2685;This Director's Cut is a superior film in every way.
2686;I'm a fan of Scott's epic storytelling, but this movie is the best so far.
2687;I believe it compares quite well with the epic films of the past.
2688;If you have problems with battle gore, you WILL have some issues, but otherwise this is a wonderful movie.
2689;I really liked the moive as it was originally realeased but this director's cut adds so much more to the story and answers so many of the questions I had about the original story.
2690;The Director's cut is like an entirely new movie!!
2691;This costs Balian much of his Christian faith, and costs the priest his life.
2692;the rest of the story builds well.
2693;Balian enters Jerusalem, and rises in importance there.
2694;Although their voices aren't as loud, he speaks as one of the secular rulers of the city, dealing as fairly as he can with Jew, Muslim, and Christian alike.
2695;The battle scenes are dramatic.
2696;His personal honor is known and respected among the attackers, so they trade him the brick and stone of the city for the lives of its citizens, and for their safe passage out.
2697;The battles are vivid, even if parts them were computer enhanced.
2698;It's well made, with characters you can care about, and better than a lot of other quasi.
2699;i've always enjoyed Ridley Scott's storytelling.
2700;I've enjoyed his choice of supporting actors.
2701;his association with famous composers such as Vangelis makes his movies timeless (think Blade Runner).
2702;This is probably what tamed this story as well.
2703;if you liked Joan of Arc, Troy or Alexander, this one is for you.
2704;If you don't, it would be a great history lesson full of feelings and action.
2705;This was a suprise extra gift for my husnband for our anniversary .
2706;ray are great and is the audio track.
2707;Sony has delivered its promise in respect to Blu.
2708;The added scenes not only answered a myriad of questions but brought true continuity to the film.
2709;It was worth the extra time out of our soooo busy pitiful lives!
2710;Still, a great film especially in Blue Ray and the full director's cut.
2711;The extra 50 minutes are well worth viewing.
2712;The 'extra' lepracy storyline made a vivid contrast between a succeeding man wearing a mask and a young boy about to embark on a journey of great pain.
2713;the camera view of listening characters responding to key passages was a little strained at times but again such views encourage a broader perspective from the viewer.
2714;All of the scenes, especially the battle scenes look real.
2715;"The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)"" (very good), but it's not bad either."
2716;"disc Edition),"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a film that can be enjoyed just for the visuals and soundtrack."
2717;i'm no connoisseur of the crusades but I realize the filmmakers put a modern swing on the events and ideology of the characters.
2718;In any case, I was impressed that all the main players are based on real.
2719;life people and that the gist of the events is accurate.
2720;"The DC is heralded as one of the best DCs ever released, like ""Daredevil (Director's Cut)."
2721;"BOTTOM LINE: Kingdom of Heaven"" is worth it just for the magnificent visuals and soundtrack."
2722;The story starts strong and ends strong while the dramatics of the lengthy mid.
2723;section are complicated and not very compelling, but Orlando Bloom is likable as the protagonist.
2724;A great movie to watch.
2725;It's a long movie but worth the time.
2726;This is a fantastic movie.
2727;I consider it Ridley Scotts best costume film ever, even better than Gladiator.
2728;It is a rich cinematic experience that will move you to another time and place and entertain you on the way.
2729;blood characters, showcase their way of life and present historical battles.
2730;All this is tied together with a nice story by Ridley Scott.
2731;As always his stories are deeply personal but with wide ramifications.
2732;You get it all: from the everyday joys and sorrows to world politics.
2733;The movie is close enought to the historical facts to be convincing.
2734;Still Ridley Scott manages to walk the line and portray both sides in a fair way.
2735;"Actually they are the ""good guys"" through most of the film."
2736;Orlando does a good job and is quite convincing (and it is not his fault that he is good looking).
2737;And as for the rest of the cast it is top.
2738;There are also a number of actors with Middle Eastern origin.
2739;This gives the film credibility (Remeber the blockbuster TV.
2740;In Gladiator the lead character, Maximus (played by Russell Crowe), is a successful and self.
2741;confident general who falls into disfavour and as a cruel twist of fate is turned into a gladiatior.
2742;Eventually he manages to become famous in his new role and reclaims his freedom.
2743;This combination of factors infuses the whole film with a positive feeling.
2744;"However, it is their problem
2745;packed with thrilling and beautiful battle scenes.
2746;But that is a trilogy and fantasy at that.
2747;This is the real thing.
2748;It is a real feast for the eye.
2749;Ridley Scott manages also to touch on the big questions of life .
2750;life crisis, love, loyalty, moral, friendship.
2751;An undeniable mark of a master director.
2752;I really hope he makes a sequel to this fabulous movie.
2753;And both he and the script writer John Mathieson seem very keen on this as they confess on the extra material.
2754;As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.
2755;This movie is an exuberant epic uunparalelled in it's year when it didn't recieve any critical acclaim or rewards but pish posh what do they know, this movie is fantastic!
2756;Watching it through a couple times makes me like it even more a great adition to any blu ray library that captures the essence of a profound theatrical experience, with amazing costume, set design, and stunning but ultra realistic visuals, the only surreal thing about this film (on blu ray at least) is the vibrant colors!
2757;super duper viually pleasing not very realistic but very entertaining, we watch movie for enterainment not reality, unless its a documentary!
2758;the action looked good but there just wasnt enough.
2759;i dont recommend this one.
2760;well let me tell you one thing.
2761;this director cut is a true masterpiece!
2762;give this movie a second chance!
2763;Watch the Director's Cut and you will be pleasantly surprised.
2764;this is a set you will treasure.
2765;The blu ray version of this film is pristine!
2766;Orlando Bloom holds his own as the lead.
2767;Brilliant transfer to Blu Ray and fantastic audio.
2768;Again thank you for a job well done.
2769;The film looks terrific, and the subject matter is very interesting.
2770;Still, there is enough here to be entertained for an hour or two, but one viewing would be enough for me.
2771;This film has such a simple message.
2772;Congradulations upon your self appointed judgement seat over humanity.
2773;Not on religous ground but because Ridley Scott did such a tremendous job of delivering.
2774;It was beautiful, the music was top notch, and I thought the acting was great.
2775;I love war epics and this one kept me engaged throughout.
2776;the extras are nice also.
2777;I liked the A&E"
2778;i highly recommend this movie to those who liked Troy, Braveheart, The Last Samurai, and Gladiator.
