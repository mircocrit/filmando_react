I:15383;1;Michael Caine is great as usual.
I:15383;2;The story is fantastic in the truest sense of the word.
I:15383;3;`The Prestige' is an intriguing magician story that provides a spine.
I:15383;4;tingling movie experience as the film moves along.
I:15383;5;`The Prestige' becomes a taut and impressive display of tricks played on the stage and with the audience.
I:15383;6;There is also a historical rivalry between the brilliant eccentric inventor, Tesla (David Bowie), and Thomas Edison that gives the whole affair more depth and meaning.
I:15383;7;The suspense, as with any magic show, is impressive as is some of the delivery.
I:15383;8;`The Prestige' is expert at making one guess what will happen next.
I:15383;9;With plenty of steps and a few missteps, `The Prestige' offers a dark, but delightful show, even if some of the magic is too unbelievable even when seen.
I:15383;10;Two of my favorite actors and the movie is full of twists and turns that keeps you on your toes till the VERY end.
I:15383;11;Well I've got something to tell you, Hollywood.
I:15383;12;One of the best movies out there.
I:15383;13;It's even better the second and third times!
I:15383;14;The Prestige is a terrific film, in which there lies a secret, a twist, a climax, and yes.
I:15383;15;and I mean always (Empire of the Sun, Batman Returns la.
I:15383;16;and Michael Caine manages again to pull of his wise charm.
I:15383;17;She's blatantly underused, but this is after.
I:15383;18;it is quite refreshing to see David Bowie in a non Labyrinthian role.
I:15383;19;He is quite the wizard, in a modern scientific way.
I:15383;20;i liked the Prestige a lot, and yes that's a friggin overused term, but I did.
I:15383;21;excellent acting and plot .
I:15383;22;This is a fantastic movie that is only enhanced on Blu.
I:15383;23;the story is told in such a way that I would have thought would be confusing, yet I found myself keeping up fine, kudos to the writer and director.
I:15383;24;I look forward to seeing it a second time with all the knowledge I gained from the first viewing.
I:15383;25;This movie has an old film feel that adds to the intrigue.
I:15383;26;I truly enjoyed this film, and it definitely puts Bale and Jackman on my short list.
I:15383;27;Definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and one of the best I have seen lately.
I:15383;28;bale combination but the movie was stunning even when those two were not on the screen.
I:15383;29;it is one the most frightening stories in a non.
I:15383;30;But the realization of what limits a human being can go to .
I:15383;31;david Bowie is perfect as Tesla who plays his demonic role to perfection.
I:15383;32;He is in himself a force of nature and .
I:15383;33;his gift to Angier gives much more than was asked for .
I:15383;34;and also demands an exorbitant price.
I:15383;35;"when you realize what Angier is doing with his last brilliant trick and what he is ready to live through for his moment of ""prestige"", it leaves you chilled to the bone."
I:15383;36;absolutely brilliant and highly recommended if you prefer a slow building of tension and elegant horrors of the mind and character rather than MTV.
I:15383;37;Magic is a favorite theme of writers, actors, and film makers for the obvious reason that this craft so closely parallels their own, the spinning of illusion to make audiences forget for a moment what a dull, hard place the world can be by believing, however briefly, in something that is patently false.
I:15383;38;But there's enough intrigue to hold you for the big finish, and The Prestige keeps you guessing literally until the final seconds.
I:15383;39;Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson lead the way .
I:15383;40;all are excellent although Bale struggles with his Cockney accent.
I:15383;41;But magic is power, and a century ago, it was possible to hold an entire audience in the palm of your hand, if you had the right Prestige.
I:15383;42;worth watching more than once, just so you can try to figure out how they did it.
I:15383;43;I picked this up because I think Christian Bale is an incredible actor.
I:15383;44;I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's storyline.
I:15383;45;I can honestly say that this a movie that is great the first time around and even better when you watch it a second time.
I:15383;46;I really enjoy this movie (which is why I invested in blu.
I:15383;47;ray) its set at the turn of the 20th century, and is so realistic with great acting!
I:15383;48;If you have not seen this film, you must see it.
I:15383;49;It takes more than smoke and mirrorsTo produce a grand illusionMagicians have their special tricksFor crafting a delusionThe warm.
I:15383;50;The last scene where jackman talks about magic is hilarious.
I:15383;51;This movie really keeps you on your toes and interested.
I:15383;52;The ending was quite interesting albeit a little far fetched.
I:15383;53;I enjoyed watching the Prestige .
I:15383;54;"it was well cast, directed, and acted
I:15383;55;"I prefer it if a movie makes me feel good
I:15383;56;This is a good movie!
I:15383;57;This is a Christopher Nolan flick, so you will need to pay close attention or you will get lost.
I:15383;58;Some of the behind the scenes magic act stuff is interesting, and the acting is top notch from the entire cast.
I:15383;59;I especially love David Bowie's small role as Tesla.
I:15383;60;This is a must see for fans of drama, and for any Nolan fans.
I:15383;61;michael Caine is superbly understated.
I:15383;62;Rest assured that there's a well deserved Special Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in Caine's future.
I:15383;63;There are a number of plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:15383;64;If you truly want to be entertained, and you appreciate magic (as in: professional stage magic and magicians) you will adore this film.
I:15383;65;all the actors are at their best, here.
I:15383;66;And, the film holds a bit of a surprise at the end, although cynical folks will say they saw it coming.
I:15383;67;it's easy to say, after one has viewed the film, that it was all so obvious.
I:15383;68;repeated viewings do yield some interesting gems, even when one knows what happens at the end.
I:15383;69;The cast in this movie is amazing!
I:15383;70;Any movie with two powerful actors like Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is always amazing!
I:15383;71;This movie keeps your head turning at every minute and is definitely worth watching.
I:15383;72;I enjoyed the suspense and the suprising twists in the movie.
I:15383;73;which leads him to Tesla and an invention which should top Borden's trick .
I:15383;74;but at a soul rending price.
I:15383;75;never the less, the film is a wonderful blend of character study and the world of magic and magicians.
I:15383;76;The best aspect of this movie was that it gave a lot of after movie discussion with my teens about the movie.
I:15383;77;Interesting movie that is worth watching and better to discuss and speculate about.
I:15383;78;It will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end, which is unbelievable.
I:15383;79;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman give amazing performances as two rival magicians.
I:15383;80;You will want to see this movie again and again!
I:15383;81;I have enjoyed most all of the movies that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have done, so I thought that with the two of them together this film would be a great one.
I:15383;82;I saw this movie in the theater and really wanted to see it again.
I:15383;83;Great cast (who wouldn't like looking at Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman?)
I:15383;84;After watching this movie, I really wanted to talk about it with someone .
I:15383;85;Most people seem to love it, however others don't see what the fuss is about.
I:15383;86;the first time I watched the movie, I enjoyed it but knew I needed to watch it again to see what I'd missed.
I:15383;87;the second time I watched it, I enjoyed it even more because I picked up a couple of other things I hadn't seen the first go round.
I:15383;88;At that point I thought I'd figured it out, but wondered what others thought about it.
I:15383;89;And those thoughts inspired me to .
I:15383;90;And now I am supremely impressed by the Christopher Nolan's own skills as a magician.
I:15383;91;As for me, I love this film.
I:15383;92;You'll definitely want to watch it again!I loved it!!!!
I:15383;93;Became one of my favorite movies!
I:15383;94;At doing this `The Prestige' excels masterfully.
I:15383;95;He expertly crafts this film, layering each newfound discovery about these men so that the audience is completely entranced.
I:15383;96;He uses his cast as they should be, allowing them to shine yet never overpower the brilliance of the film or give away too much of themselves too soon.
I:15383;97;`The Prestige' is one of those near perfect films that comes along only once in a great while, a film that one can truly adore, stand behind and find fascinating with every viewing.
I:15383;98;That's one of the greatest things about `The Prestige'.
I:15383;99;With each and every viewing the audience is able to spot more pieces of the puzzle, things throughout the film they had never caught before but now know to look for.
I:15383;100;the storyline is engrossing as well, and that as we know is truly the most important facet to a film of this caliber.
I:15383;101;Robert and Alfred at one time worked together as assistants to another well known magician.
I:15383;102;As the magicians go their separate ways Robert's obsession grows.
I:15383;103;the acting is brilliant as well, especially on the part of Christian Bale.
I:15383;104;Bale has always been one of my favorite actors but he never seems to pick a movie that is as well crafted as his skill.
I:15383;105;In films like `American Psycho' and `The Machinist' he proves to be the best part of the film and without him the movie kind of falls apart.
I:15383;106;Here though he finally found a film worth his talent.
I:15383;107;"He is so commanding, so engrossing and just as intriguing as the film itself
I:15383;108;High Jackman is also quite impressive.
I:15383;109;He had a great year in 2006, and while I preferred his performance in `The Fountain' I must say that I was blown away here as well.
I:15383;110;Michael Caine, one of our finest working actors, a true legend, does not disappoint and delivers an outstanding supporting performance as Cutter, a mentor to either men at one time or another.
I:15383;111;There are a few women in this film, and each of them hold there own.
I:15383;112;Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as always as Olivia, assistant to either men at one time or another.
I:15383;113;She perfectly balances her own sexuality with a commanding aura.
I:15383;114;She is, without question, one of our most talented working actresses.
I:15383;115;Her performance is heartbreaking to say the least.
I:15383;116;It's one of those rare gems that just seems to fit in every possible way and soars high above the rest of the competition.
I:15383;117;I have a feeling that we are soon to see some spectacular things from director Christopher Nolan, even more spectacular then the brilliance he's already dealt to his audience.
I:15383;118;This is a fantastic film .
I:15383;119;Even my 11/13 year old sons thought it was one of the best films they ever saw.
I:15383;120;telling the story of two rival magicians over the course of a few years (starting somewhere in the 1890s and ending around 1900), The Prestige is a great story of love, revenge, duality, and mystery.
I:15383;121;"Angier on the other hand is a wonderful performer
I:15383;122;Directory Christopher Nolan, who also did the amazing Memento and Batman Begins, is a master of non.
I:15383;123;the central mysteries of the film are very well.
I:15383;124;"done
I:15383;125;everything about The Prestige is well done, from the acting to the effects to the writing.
I:15383;126;Having enjoyed all of director Christopher Nolan's other films (particularlyMemento) I was eagerly looking forward to watching The Prestige.
I:15383;127;I liked it, was thoroughly entertained, and while one of the films twists is easy to figure out, I was kept guessing up until the end.
I:15383;128;A magic trick is nice to watch, and maybe you think about how the magician did things, but at the end of the day there really isn't a whole lot of depth to it.
I:15383;129;from a technical aspect the film is well acted (although Scarlett Johansson is largely wasted), it's well produced and directed, and the screenplay is deviously clever.
I:15383;130;Recommended for anyone who like Christopher Nolan, magic, and movies that keep you guessing.
I:15383;131;keeps you on the edge and very thought provoking!
I:15383;132;Actors are phenomenonal in this movie!
I:15383;133;Most underrated Nolan movie, it is a lesson in crafty and engrossing screenplay.
I:15383;134;man, this is the movie to watch.
I:15383;135;Wow awesome movie big fan of Christian bale, but all around one of my favorite movies!!
I:15383;136;Hands down a must watch story is awesome and always able to re watch it!!
I:15383;137;This movie has a lot going for it, strong performers, strong performances, and a solid premise.
I:15383;138;Some of the twists and turns are a little easy to see through, but the film does build emotionally and I do think most people will be intrigued to see how it turns out.
I:15383;139;The Prestige is why I continue to enjoy going to the movies.
I:15383;140;Every once and awhile you get something unique and surprising and it makes it all worthwhile.
I:15383;141;A story of two 19th Century magician's (nicely played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) whose bitter rivalry is founded in a tragedy allows Christopher Nolan to do some movie prestidigitation as well, telling his tale cutting back and forth between the two men while moving forward and backward in time as well.
I:15383;142;the film offers nicely rendered period detail of London and Colorado Springs, combines a bit of lore (the magician's three acts of The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige), a bit of history (the rivalry of Thomas Edison and Nikolai Tesla) a bit of intrigue, a bit of mystery and more.
I:15383;143;It is complex but comprehensible if you're paying attention.
I:15383;144;with this as it's frame, the Nolan brothers explore the meaning and nuances of indentity, technical competence versus showmanship and presentation (Bordin and Argien, Tesla and Edison), and the creative value of obsession and the price paid for indulging one's obsessions, and, of course, the fascination of magic, that most theatrical manipulation of truth and illusion.
I:15383;145;A bit of movie magic here, I found The Prestige intriguing and mesmerizing, much like a first rate feat of legerdemain, clever and original.
I:15383;146;This is my favorite blu.
I:15383;147;The sheer brilliance of the trick is in its simplicity, I will say no more lest i give something away.
I:15383;148;The fact that Borden has fooled even the closest eye, the people who watch him day in and day out, really says something about his character, and all human characters, really.
I:15383;149;The dedication to the thing is such that I have rarely seen.
I:15383;150;The movie is about committment to love, be it for person place or thing.
I:15383;151;The competing magicians are after the love of the game, the high from performing, the competition of one.
I:15383;152;upping the other, and knowing that they are on top.
I:15383;153;That obsession, the glassy eyed look when it runs through the mind, the way the heart races!
I:15383;154;It is true of all who have ever felt that they would live or die for something.
I:15383;155;That, my good people, is the magic in this movie.
I:15383;156;The Prestige is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.
I:15383;157;Great plot, stellar cast and nail.
I:15383;158;As usual a well done atta a boy for becoming the chracter.
I:15383;159;2006 has been a quiet year for event films.
I:15383;160;The predicted blockbusters this past summer pretty much underperformed despite some being exactly as good as I thought they'd be.
I:15383;161;It's a very good thing that I had smaller films to tide me over.
I:15383;162;This year has been a very good ones for some independent.
I:15383;163;It's a novel written in epistolary format with each chapter and section written as entries into the journal of one of the main characters in the story.
I:15383;164;The novel itself is pretty straightforward as it tells the story in near chronological order.
I:15383;165;I was glad that the Nolan brothers were inventive enough to borrow abit from Christopher Nolan's first feature film, Memento.
I:15383;166;The two Nolans fudges abit with the timeline to add some backstory filler to help give the characters that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman portrays with the reason for their pathological obsession with each other.
I:15383;167;christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for The Prestige was able to keep the mystery of the story intact, but it also keeps the amount of red herrings in such films to a minimum.
I:15383;168;"Soon, the magician will follow this up with ""The Turn"" where the abovementioned ordinary object does something extraordinary in front of the audience."
I:15383;169;That's pretty much the film in a nutshell.
I:15383;170;The clues are there for the audience to see, gather and extrapolate their answer to the mystery that is the story.
I:15383;171;In fact, anyone who pays attention will be able to solve one.
I:15383;172;I've already mentioned that throughout the film their mutual obsession about each other is due to a backstory detailing their past.
I:15383;173;All of it in the name of humiliating and upstaging the other due to a tragic incident early in their mutual careers.
I:15383;174;most adaptors will try to make a story's characters more sympathetic and likable.
I:15383;175;But even these two dark characters continue to exude the charisma and strong personalities that the audience will root for one or the other.
I:15383;176;both Jackman and Bale play their characters well.
I:15383;177;Even Scarlett Johansson does very well with the part she's given.
I:15383;178;It's a part that many sees as more of a throwaway character.
I:15383;179;A piece of very good.
I:15383;180;the Prestige also has a distinct look about it.
I:15383;181;century London just before the start of the new millenium gives it a certain sense of Victorian.
I:15383;182;David Bowie portrays Tesla as an eccentric genius whose search for the secrets of the universe will lead to the discovery of what many of that era would consider magic.
I:15383;183;It's the ingenius looking technology created for the Tesla sequence which finally gives The Prestige it's root in fantasy and science.
I:15383;184;Some will see it as a thriller with twists and turns that doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience.
I:15383;185;Those people will probably be correct as well.
I:15383;186;All I know is that this is a film that delivers on its premise to confound and amaze.
I:15383;187;It also continues to validate my views that Bruce Wayne and Batman are in very good hands with Christopher Nolan at the wheel.
I:15383;188;The Prestige is easily one of the best film of 2006.
I:15383;189;borden was always the better magician by far, but he lacked the showmanship to really sell his performances.
I:15383;190;"It's an illusion he calls, ""the greatest magic trick he's ever seen."""
I:15383;191;He works with Cutter to try and figure the trick out.
I:15383;192;the Turn:Director Christopher Nolan is a master of the psychological thriller genre, and that's exactly what this film is.
I:15383;193;While many people will be watching this film for the twists and turns, the real meat is in the examination of these two fantastic and psychotic characters.
I:15383;194;Watching each of them break down over time consumed by their own ambitions and obsessions is both disturbing and fascinating to watch.
I:15383;195;The Prestige is the first film since Memento that brother Jonathan Nolan helped right.
I:15383;196;Like that film, The Prestige tells it's story in an unusual fashion.
I:15383;197;In The Prestige, just like Memento, the narrative style serves a very strong purpose.
I:15383;198;The openning of the film has Michael Caine narrating the concept of a magic act in three parts: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.
I:15383;199;Like great magicians, the Nolans let you figure out what they want you to figure out so that all the while the real illusion carries out right before your eyes unnoticed.
I:15383;200;christopher Nolan again proves he's the finest director to hit the scene in some time.
I:15383;201;When you get this kind of talent working for this kind of director, it's a given.
I:15383;202;What really makes this film is the screenplay.
I:15383;203;It succeeds not only as a top notch thriller and mystery, but also an intriguing character study.
I:15383;204;The narrative for the story is brilliantly devised.
I:15383;205;From the set design, to the costumes, to the musical score, all the production values are top notch.
I:15383;206;this is one of those films that is so hard to write a review for because to discuss some of the great things about the film is to reveal the film itself.
I:15383;207;the Prestige:The Prestige is easily one of the best films of the year.
I:15383;208;Like Memento it is a complex and tightly woven story that can't be completely digested in one viewing, though it certainly can be enjoyed.
I:15383;209;Beautifully written and acted by two amazing actors.
I:15383;210;Christian and Hugh together make a great film and this movie just keep you on your toes all throughout the movie.
I:15383;211;The movie will definitely go into my top 50 list of greatest movie ever made based on story, acting performances and scripting.
I:15383;212;Great performances and entertaining twists in the film makes 'The Prestige' a highly recommended watch for the mystery and thriller genre fans out there which will keep you intrigue and guessing all way till the end of the movie.
I:15383;213;The Prestige is a superb film which may actually be the finest translation of a work of literature to the screen that I've ever seen.
I:15383;214;The film is incredibly faithful to the themes and spirit of the novel, but not slavishly so.
I:15383;215;the film's success is built around its two protagonists.
I:15383;216;Bale and Jackman turn in supremely accomplished performances (the latter possibly in a career.
I:15383;217;best performance), each having to play a complex, driven character each of whom is carrying weighty secrets and mysteries.
I:15383;218;nolan's direction, having to handle a complex, non.
I:15383;219;linear narrative and not lose the audience in confusion, is very good.
I:15383;220;This is where the real success of the movie lies.
I:15383;221;The idea that this could be translated to cinema seems unthinkable, but Nolan delivers it here with considerable success.
I:15383;222;the Prestige (*****) is a most accomplished film, well.
I:15383;223;paced and dramatic, with a tremendous sense of mystery.
I:15383;224;It starts with the trial where one of the magicians is charged with murdering the other.
I:15383;225;this movie is very, very successful at doing that, although I had some pretty clever guesses as to what happened along the way.
I:15383;226;I didn't really figure out very much, but I think it's impressive that I got anything right.
I:15383;227;Suspenseful and interesting with an unpredictable ending puts this at the top of my list.
I:15383;228;Great acting by both leading men makes this a must.
I:15383;229;I bought this movie based on seeing the trailer and Im glad I did.
I:15383;230;The cast is great from Bale to Jackmon and Caine.
I:15383;231;The story is great and you will be watching it again and again.
I:15383;232;I enjoyed this film throughout.
I:15383;233;The suspense, the mystery, the magic, and the science of magic are beautifully crafted into a moving story.
I:15383;234;Something about the magic of illusion lends itself to the metaphor of film, and both movies played on the themes of things not being as they appear.
I:15383;235;The Prestige lingers still as the more haunting film that makes you think long after the final scene.
I:15383;236;The film did a great job streamlining the plot from the novel from which The Prestige is adapted.
I:15383;237;The cinematography is beautifully evocative of a time of magic when the world was evolving toward the industrial age.
I:15383;238;The story is pure mastery of unexpected developments.
I:15383;239;the title, The Prestige, becomes the theme of the movie, taking an expanded meaning from the book.
I:15383;240;But subtle metaphors also play into the rich tapestry of symbols that support the themes of how far one goes to create illusion.
I:15383;241;The story is an interesting one with a few twists.
I:15383;242;the acting is good as is the filming.
I:15383;243;"One of our favorite movies in my home is ""The Prestige""."
I:15383;244;It is an incredible work of art.
I:15383;245;"The movie stars Christian Bale, of ""The Dark Knight"" fame, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and yes, David Bowie."
I:15383;246;christopher Nolan did a wonderful job of creating a spooky, dark, ambiance for the story.
I:15383;247;It quickly draws you in, and keeps you hooked for the entire show.
I:15383;248;david Bowie is a standout, of course, as Nickola Tesla.
I:15383;249;Those of you who haven't seen one, it would really be worth you while to do so.
I:15383;250;Kind of slow, but good.
I:15383;251;Christopher Nolan has proved himself a master story teller.
I:15383;252;Tucked in between his first two Batman films, The Prestige, is a solid piece of writing and direction.
I:15383;253;It moves with deliberation and reveals itself in the third act as one of the greatest feats in Nolan's act.
I:15383;254;Each magician holds a secret, key to their respective acts, that once revealed, would end their careers.
I:15383;255;The Prestige takes the viewer right to that very end.
I:15383;256;as earlier stated, the writing and direction by Nolan is done with a master's stroke.
I:15383;257;All of the actors turn in spectacular efforts.
I:15383;258;Michael Cain is his usual fantastic self.
I:15383;259;Scarlett Johansson's role is especially juicy, as she makes the switch from Jackman's assistant to Bale's.
I:15383;260;the Prestige was a great piece of movie magic.
I:15383;261;At the beginning of THE PRESTIGE, Michael Caine asks us an important question, then tells us the three main stages of a magic trick.
I:15383;262;This is very important, as the rest of the movie is set up in these stages, while retaining an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.
I:15383;263;"The symbolism of the canaries is crucial, in that they represent the living ""pledge""."
I:15383;264;I find this movie fascinating.
I:15383;265;It raises so many interesting questions!
I:15383;266;Like a good puzzle, it keeps me working at it, even when it confounds me!
I:15383;267;The most notable thing about the film is the cast, including an impressive list of both young talents, such as Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson, plus venerable older and more experienced names such as Michael Caine and the brilliantly elusive David Bowie.
I:15383;268;The director, as the filmmaker for the acclaimed `Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan, is also a talent not to be taken lightly.
I:15383;269;One thriller / surprise ending movie which comes to mind in evaluating this story is the original `The Manchurian Candidate', based on an improbable premise, but so well written, directed, and acted that we form great bonds of sympathy for the main characters, strengthened, at least at the time the movie was released, by a political climate which made the film far less improbable seeming than it actually was.
I:15383;270;And, the ending was in fact a great, unexpected surprise.
I:15383;271;The strength of the surprise ending is from both the revelation of `the facts of the case' plus the remarkably devious plan to which the physical circumstances are put to resolve the conflict set in motion by the death of the magician's wife.
I:15383;272;this is better than many `special effects fests' such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Remarkable Gentlemen', and it's twists and turns will probably deserve a second and third viewing to get everything straight, but this is very good second rate moviemaking, not worthy of exceptional praise.
I:15383;273;Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground.
I:15383;274;ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared.
I:15383;275;similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.
I:15383;276;crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie.
I:15383;277;inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.
I:15383;278;the big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;279;Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.
I:15383;280;The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.
I:15383;281;I like stuff with twists and turns that keeps your imagination and intellect busy and reeling.
I:15383;282;This was a fantastic movie and I have literally thought about it over and over.
I:15383;283;It's definately one to watch many many times.
I:15383;284;The movie is fast moving and captures your interest from the very beginning.
I:15383;285;There are numerous twists and turns that come together at the end.
I:15383;286;I particularly like the historical part of the movie where Tesla entered the a central part of the theme and you saw the competition with Edison.
I:15383;287;I found the movie most enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone who like magic.
I:15383;288;driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci.
I:15383;289;Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved!A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended.
I:15383;290;Performancepmade it look like an exciting and interesting movie with lots of magic performance in it and it was really just about two guys and their feud with a sprinkling of magic
I:15383;291;I highly recommend this movie.
I:15383;292;As with everything that Nolan has his hands on, it is very stylish and brings on feelings that you weren't aware could be brought on by a film.
I:15383;293;And WOW the twist and turns this one takes.
I:15383;294;Once you think you have it all figured out there is another huge twist and throws your world out of whack again.
I:15383;295;twister, it'll keep you on the edge of your seats!
I:15383;296;Recommended to anyone who likes a real brain.
I:15383;297;Magic and sleight of hand is not really to my liking, but I decided to go anyway, mostly because of the wonderful cast and director Chris Nolan.
I:15383;298;The cast played wonderfully, Jackman and Bale both did great jobs portraying two obsessed magic rivals.
I:15383;299;Also Michael Caine did, as always, deliver a good performance.
I:15383;300;The direction of the film is equally good with mr. Nolan giving it a slightly dark edge, and the production values are top notch.
I:15383;301;They did a wonderful job recreating a victorian London environment and the film is visualy very interesting and pleasing.
I:15383;302;That being said, it is still a good film and definitely worth seeing.
I:15383;303;It is more than just visuals and more than just scifi, it's a good story of rivalry, envy and obsession.
I:15383;304;The Prestige is a work of film making genius.
I:15383;305;The plot has so many twists and turns it will successfully keep you guessing until the end.
I:15383;306;The Prestige is written by Jonathan Nolan and directed by Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;307;These brothers team up on this project along with Christopher's wife Emma Thomas, as a producer, to create a masterpiece of immense proportions.
I:15383;308;In this thrilling story two magicians, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, battle for one another's power and fame, often allowing their obsession to get the best of them.
I:15383;309;the acting by Jackman and Bale is superb, as is that of Scarlet Johansson as the charming Olivia Wenscombe.
I:15383;310;Olivia is a beautiful assistant haired by Angier to help him one up Borden.
I:15383;311;While this is the least of the questions that must be answered through the course of this movie, it keeps you guessing just as well as the rest and the answer isn't revealed until the last few minutes of the movie.
I:15383;312;while this is a wonderful story line for a movie, some of the morals taught through the events of the movie are not very good.
I:15383;313;It keeps jumping around, somewhat annoyingly.
I:15383;314;Since then I have seen it like 10 times and it makes more and more sense each time.
I:15383;315;Not to mention the amazing acting by every character.
I:15383;316;This will LITERALLY have you anywhere between the edge of your seat to an inch from the screen!
I:15383;317;He has a habit of overacting everything.
I:15383;318;The special effects were good, and some of the scenes were well put.
I:15383;319;The story is very well written and the acting is excellent.
I:15383;320;It is suspenseful and entertaining, The Prestige is a breath of fresh air.
I:15383;321;It is like a modern Alfred Hitchcock film.
I:15383;322;I was pleasantly surprised by this sleeper of a hit.
I:15383;323;What fascinated me about `The Prestige' is the inclusion of the real life visionary, scientist Nikola Tesla into the storyline.
I:15383;324;as for the all important question, which is the superior film?
I:15383;325;not the best movie considering the cast and director.
I:15383;326;but worth watching if you can't find anything else.
I:15383;327;THE PRESTIGE is one of the best films of 2006!
I:15383;328;I loved the many, many plot twists and surprises!
I:15383;329;I recommend that you view this with a friend and see if you both come to the same conclusions over what ended up happening throughout the film!
I:15383;330;it has a lot of the director's taste for jumping back and forth between flashbacks and present tense, but it is easy to follow, chronologically.
I:15383;331;this is a film about two characters who may not be that likeable in real life, portrayed by two actors who are very charismatic and likeable onscreen, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.
I:15383;332;I recommend watching the Illusionist instead.
I:15383;333;movie, the acting was great, and I'm sure most people will enjoy this flick even if they are confused at the end.
I:15383;334;I ordered this product for my son.
I:15383;335;We saw it a few years ago at the theater and really loved it.
I:15383;336;Plain and simple I would recommend that you watch it!
I:15383;337;I'm a huge Ed Norton fan, and liked the job he did in his role, but the duo of Jackman/Bale was absolutely perfectly cast for this film.
I:15383;338;Viewed in that light, this film offers some very human, and often downright frightening characters.
I:15383;339;as a period piece, it does an adequate job of placing a modern storyline into turn of the century London, but the film is certainly not a period piece at its core.
I:15383;340;The period is just a backdrop for some really good human drama, with some sleight.
I:15383;341;hand (the best of which is performed by director Chris Nolan) and science fiction elements, which are present simply to advance the story, not take center.
I:15383;342;if you pay close attention, you'll likely catch onto a couple of the 'twists' that are revealed at the end, but there is still enough going on that nearly everyone who watches the film will be entertained by all of the turns exposed late in the film.
I:15383;343;as a human drama, this film is exquisite.
I:15383;344;As a revenge story, it is excellent.
I:15383;345;But overall the film is a 5 star offering.
I:15383;346;down the best overall presentation, especially visually.
I:15383;347;This was a very well done movie.
I:15383;348;I always enjoy movies that Hugh Jackman is in and the back and forth kept you on your toes.
I:15383;349;A suspenseful and wonderous story unfolds for us in this riveting tale of two competitive illusionists.
I:15383;350;I really enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend it.
I:15383;351;There are enough surprises to keep you guessing and the ending is a big one.
I:15383;352;Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well.
I:15383;353;One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe.
I:15383;354;I love this movie so much.
I:15383;355;also, it shipped fast, and came in perfect condition.
I:15383;356;The multiple story lines made this already complex movie, just perfect.
I:15383;357;Insanely well done rendition of the book.
I:15383;358;two young talented men work together and are fascinated by the field of magic performance.
I:15383;359;He actually plays the conscious of Robert, the voice of morality and reason, that Robert sometimes hears and sometimes ignores.
I:15383;360;Testler is actually the devil, the force of evil that grants a man a superhuman gift so that the gift can bring about their downfall.
I:15383;361;His grief and desire for revenge remain his motivation for living and even keeps him blind to the advantages of loving his lovely assistant, played by Scarlette Johansson.
I:15383;362;The Prestige is a truly thrilling tale about two magicians whose ruthless rivalry stems from a tragic accident (for which one blames the other).
I:15383;363;do each other in their respective magic shows.
I:15383;364;just how far will he go to utilize it in his show, and take his final prestige with the satisfaction of knowing he has won.
I:15383;365;from start to finish, this movie will hold you in it's spell.
I:15383;366;Hugh Jackman and Christina Bale turn in electrifying performances as the battling magicians, and they each compliment each other very well.
I:15383;367;Scarlett Johannsen has a supporting role, as does Michael Caine.
I:15383;368;In the film, the two magicians battle each other to claim the greatest prestige to the most dazzling trick imaginable.
I:15383;369;throughout the film you will see the obsession within each magician grow .
I:15383;370;and you will see the price each pays for it.
I:15383;371;or will you press on with your obsession until it completely destroys you and those you love?A small sticking point is that the film *does* give the viewer enough clues to deduce the big twist revealed at the end.
I:15383;372;Even if you think you've figured it out before the ending, just sit back and enjoy the ride anyway!Bottom line, this film is fantastic, and very well written, directed, and acted.
I:15383;373;I highly recommend it because you won't be disappointed in this thrill.
I:15383;374;As soon as it's over you want to watch it again!
I:15383;375;A must own if you are a fan of Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;376;I think this is a great movie and something I will watch multiple times.
I:15383;377;therefore, i think it's a good investment.
I:15383;378;The Prestige is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:15383;379;I love the twists and turns of the story line.
I:15383;380;This movie is pretty dark .
I:15383;381;watch David Bowie as Tesla, it is a gas!
I:15383;382;Not magical, but a very nicely done movie.
I:15383;383;Nice twist, but some may see it coming.
I:15383;384;Magic is a pleasure bred deep within us all.
I:15383;385;Reading a fantasy novel can be magical, seeing a wonderful film can be magical, noticing an intimate moment in the world can be magical.
I:15383;386;the Prestige is truly a magical movie.
I:15383;387;While it's plot focuses on magic and illusions, the real magic comes in the portrayal of human emotions in this movie.
I:15383;388;"The Prestige is a story of love
I:15383;389;Love for another person or love for perfection.
I:15383;390;What one has the other wants.
I:15383;391;the acting was superb in this movie.
I:15383;392;I'm becoming more and more of a Christian Bale fan.
I:15383;393;He was amazing in this movie.
I:15383;394;The surprise performance of the movie for me was David Bowie as Nikolha Tesla.
I:15383;395;I expected his acting to be forced, but it was perfect.
I:15383;396;Hugh Jackman is wonderful as always, as is the gorgeous Scarlett Johansen.
I:15383;397;Michael Caine is wonderful as always and has that same charm that he always has.
I:15383;398;the movie was filmed beautifully and captured the era perfectly.
I:15383;399;Every scene has a eerie yet comforting darkness about it and it is the total lack of special effects that makes this movie so wonderful and so authentic.
I:15383;400;The story relies much more on human emotions and interaction than the magic itself.
I:15383;401;I would've been happy with just a movie about magic, but what makes The Prestige so wonderful is that it does an amazing job at portraying the human psyche and the lengths that we go to for obsessions and for perfection.
I:15383;402;Enjoy the magnificient acting, the superb cinematography, the pacing, the soundtrack and do your absolute best to ignore the plot holes, because there's loads of them.
I:15383;403;If you are a right.
I:15383;404;But if you enjoyed Chris Nolan's previous works .
I:15383;405;odds are, you'll enjoy this one too.
I:15383;406;Much like a real magic show, it's filled with enough twists and turns to render even the most astute observer completely powerless.
I:15383;407;It's almost as if the film is daring the audience to guess the outcome, knowing full well that they won't even come close.
I:15383;408;"maybe that's because ""The Prestige"" takes the illusory aspects one step further, first by telling the story out of sequence, second by including an intense rivalry."
I:15383;409;"As described by the illusion technician Cutter (Michael Caine), they are as follows: act one is The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object
I:15383;410;He's determined to ruin Borden's reputation, first by discovering the secrets to his greatest illusions, then by making them better.
I:15383;411;This goes double for The Prestige, which is always the most impressive act of a magic show.
I:15383;412;Cutter involves himself purely as an effects wizard and manager, rigging Angier up with the latest and greatest magic.
I:15383;413;and this brings to light a fairly intricate subplot.
I:15383;414;By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand just how important this subplot is.
I:15383;415;"He's become aware a new illusion called The Transported Man
I:15383;416;I can say this: watching it work is both awesome and frightening.
I:15383;417;A central metal sphere shoots lightening bolts in all directions, all of which gain in intensity when an object is placed in the machine's center.
I:15383;418;It's both respected and feared, like all new inventions are.
I:15383;419;The tale is mystifying, but also has an emotional depth as each magician deals with great loss.
I:15383;420;This is definitely one of the top two dueling magician movies to come out in the last year, but it is also completely unbelievable.
I:15383;421;"Because as ""great"" as these magicians may have been, I've never heard of either of them."
I:15383;422;The famous magician David Copperfield, who is based on a book by Charles Dickens (I believe it is Tale of Two Cities), once made the Great Wall of China appear in the middle of the Grand Canyon, yet I'm supposed to get excited about a trick that centers around a rubber ball?
I:15383;423;"Where's the ""wow"" factor, Prestige filmmakers?In summation, when Wolverine fights Batman, nobody wins."
I:15383;424;Exciting and adventurous it kept me on the edge of my seat and my mind in knots trying to figure out what was going to happen.
I:15383;425;also, I felt that the writer/director/whomever wanted the audience to feel sympathetic for the rival magician (the one with the two fingers.
I:15383;426;He deceived his wife and child for years for the sake of a magic trick.
I:15383;427;If you want to see a much more realistic movie about a magician, see the Illusionist with Ed Norton.
I:15383;428;The Prestige is an awe.
I:15383;429;i truly enjoyed the twists and turns thoughout the course of the movie.
I:15383;430;The movie truly takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.
I:15383;431;It actually did occur in real life.
I:15383;432;The funny thing is is that magic today is just as competitive as back then.
I:15383;433;I loved the star power in this movie, which I think gives it some credibility.
I:15383;434;Great actors, interesting script .
I:15383;435;it's a movie that holds your attention throughout.
I:15383;436;Having said that, this is a fun movie with lots of twists and turns and full of good, solid entertainment value.
I:15383;437;The acting trio of Michael Caine, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman lends a strong dynamic stability to the film.
I:15383;438;The funnest thing about it for me was the fun conversation after the movie with friends who enjoyed dissecting and speculating the storyline.
I:15383;439;This is an exceptionally well written plot with many twists and turns.
I:15383;440;Too bad cause this was ultimately one of the year's best films that at times takes too many sleight of hands but in the end is masterful in its story unfolding.
I:15383;441;Borden is the most talented magician but the one with the least charisma.
I:15383;442;"To spoil any more would be a crime and you'll see how far one can go in the name of being ""the best""."
I:15383;443;"It at times felt like ""I fooled you!"
I:15383;444;wise though this is perfect across the board.
I:15383;445;definately go and watch this and experience something that should've had more attention when it started.
I:15383;446;This movie is truly a masterpiece.
I:15383;447;The way the whole story is an illusion is brilliant.
I:15383;448;Any chance I get I always love to watch this movie.
I:15383;449;Following Nolan's career for sometime now, at least since his brilliant film, Memento, hit the screens as one of the most original stories to come out in years, my expectations were quite high, fuelled by his last project, Batman Begins.
I:15383;450;the cast is certainly impressive from Jackman, Bail and a small part played by David Bowie.
I:15383;451;art direction and cinematography in this film are excellent, as a period piece it was realistic down to the smallest detail.
I:15383;452;the ending of the film is surprising though leaned towards the absurd, suddenly turning a thriller into a Science Fiction piece.
I:15383;453;the Prestige is well worth a look at, one of those films that will appeal to a certain audience, while leaving others wondering what all the hype was about.3.5 stars.
I:15383;454;"This film and ""The Illusionist"" came out at pretty much the same time."
I:15383;455;The two then take turns taking revenge upon the other as they both begin to make names for themselves.
I:15383;456;Tesla is played amazingly well by David Bowie and his assistant is non.
I:15383;457;the last part of the film, many of the secrets are revealed and you'll be left with a smile on your face as the credits role.
I:15383;458;Jackman and Bale are wonderful as are the rest of the cast.
I:15383;459;There are many reviews here that have so eloquently explained why this film is a must.
I:15383;460;see, but I have to share my enthusiasm nevertheless.
I:15383;461;The Prestige is a dark and intense gothic thriller set during the turn of the twentieth century and it tells the story of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two struggling magicians who turn against each other after a magic trick goes wrong, costing the life of Angier's wife.
I:15383;462;His motive is revenge at first, but then it takes a life of its own when discovering Borden's secrets and tricks become an obsession.
I:15383;463;i loved this film and its dark tone from beginning to end.
I:15383;464;It isn't the typical thriller by any means, for it's got substance mostly brought on by the excellent direction of Christopher Nolan and the magnificent performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine.
I:15383;465;Christian Bale is by far the best in this film.
I:15383;466;I've never seen this actor in a film before, and in addition to his good looks and gorgeous Welsh accent, I enjoyed his delivery and I look forward to watching him in other films.
I:15383;467;There are other fine performances here, one of them by David Bowie, who plays the legendary Victorian scientist Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;468;As for other aspects, the characterization Angier, Borden and the others is flawless.
I:15383;469;That is what makes this film dark in a rather unique way.
I:15383;470;I love the cinematography, the late 19th Century England setting, and the overall dark plot.
I:15383;471;This, as I and others have already said, is a must.
I:15383;472;With dark/downtrodden sets, many camera angles, and a whole lot of action, this movie keeps you in suspense.
I:15383;473;It is a very original movie, I have not seen anyting based around a subject like this before, or at least recently.
I:15383;474;Again, casting was excellent in this film with Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansen, Hall, and Perabo.
I:15383;475;Also the very improtant spot of Nikola Tesla was filled by DAVID BOWIE, which was a great role for him, and his dark, proper, and mysterious character.
I:15383;476;Check this movie out, well worth the price of admission.
I:15383;477;I enjoyed watching it and I believe you will too.
I:15383;478;I never saw this until a couple of weeks ago, and it is easily one of the very best movies i have ever seen.
I:15383;479;Seen it over and over, ill always find something new in this movie.
I:15383;480;Director Christopher Nolan skillfully directs his cast through a fascinating plot abounding with unpredictable twists which he and his brother Jonathan collaborated on.
I:15383;481;The artfully designed sets accurately represented Victorian England.
I:15383;482;bale playing Alfred Borden and Jackman playing Robert Angier were friends and associates working under a popular magician of the time and also working on their own routines.
I:15383;483;"Bale, however, the superior magician, persevered and found immense fame with his unprecedented trick ""The Transported Man""."
I:15383;484;Jackman tried to copy the ruse but could never perform it as well.
I:15383;485;I've seen this film twice now .
I:15383;486;and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour.
I:15383;487;Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.
I:15383;488;Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.
I:15383;489;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.
I:15383;490;this is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!
I:15383;491;In fact, it has multiple layers.
I:15383;492;Fine performances are given throughout, especially by the women drawn into their lives to their eventual sorrow.
I:15383;493;This is in my top 5 movies of all time.
I:15383;494;the acting is excellent, but the story line is so spectacular, able to include and hold deep questions and ideas on life while remaining highly watchable for all audiences.
I:15383;495;I find this to be the most completely complete film by Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;496;setting box office hit, this movie, nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction) is highly entertaining and well.
I:15383;497;worth the two hours of your time.
I:15383;498;i enjoyed this movie very much.
I:15383;499;Many people might compare it to Nolan's Inception as a movie with a complex storyline that requires audience participation to understand what's going on, and as a movie you'll appreciate much more each time you watch it.
I:15383;500;nevertheless, the movie boasts a solid well.
I:15383;501;written story, good acting from a well.
I:15383;502;known cast (Batman vs. Wolverine), and cinematography and directing definitely up to Nolan standards.
I:15383;503;The Movie the Prestige is a great movie that deals with revenge,obsession, and secrecy.
I:15383;504;It has a great storyline filled with twists in every direction and has great acting which consists of Christian Bale(Batman),Hugh Jackman(Wolverine), Andy Serkis(Gollum), Michael Caine( The Butler in Batman Begins), and also Scarlett Johansson(Iron Man 2).
I:15383;505;You always hear about Christopher Nolans two movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
I:15383;506;This movie has some great twists that surprised me.
I:15383;507;Than at the very end of the movie you will enjoy it and you will say abracadavre to this great movie.
I:15383;508;This was another great movie.
I:15383;509;"more indepth than 'the Illusionists"" Seeing David Bowie come back to acting was fantastic in itself."
I:15383;510;all the actors are great.
I:15383;511;they are both valuable and highly entertaining.
I:15383;512;The movie has the benefit of adventure.
I:15383;513;Even though Borden and the viewer know that he didn't do it, the success of the movie is the intricacies of the adventure that brought them to this challenging and ultimate conclusion.
I:15383;514;they've lived lives of obsession, and this comes through well in the movie.
I:15383;515;We see wives, lovers, friends, and coworkers distancing themselves from the protagonists as they become consumed by their magic, their careers and their rivalry.
I:15383;516;The book also uses some true magic realism in its effect because it takes the time to explain it.
I:15383;517;all that said, I prefer the movie to the book.
I:15383;518;It is a movie that takes patience and asks for close attention, much the way a magic trick can.
I:15383;519;part structure, and found that individual acts in the plot.
I:15383;520;christian Bale is, as always, compelling.
I:15383;521;"Hugh Jackman is very well cast here
I:15383;522;She is an intriguing distraction who is more and less important than she appears to be.
I:15383;523;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:15383;524;The shipping was fast so I was able to watch it right when it came.
I:15383;525;A good story, well acted and some special effects that make you wonder just what Mr. Tesla could have been capable of.
I:15383;526;The movie is amazing anything one by Christopher Nolan is brilliant.
I:15383;527;`The Prestige' marks one of the finest films I've seen this year, complete in every sense of the word.
I:15383;528;It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible.
I:15383;529;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy.
I:15383;530;This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please.
I:15383;531;I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well.
I:15383;532;There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea.
I:15383;533;I've seen this movie a couple of times now and really enjoy it.
I:15383;534;This cast does a great job and gives excellent performances, but what really makes this movie for me is how it's constructed.
I:15383;535;the story is told from overlapping points of view, one inside of another, an obsession within an obsession until the end.
I:15383;536;This gives this movie its real punch and makes it stand out from contemporary storytelling.
I:15383;537;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:15383;538;Great plot with a twist that I never would have guessed.
I:15383;539;Definitely a movie i would recommend.
I:15383;540;century England, the film takes us behind the scenes, as it were, to learn the mechanics of magic, its craft, secrets, and showmanship.
I:15383;541;But this film is more about the men than their magic.
I:15383;542;They sabotage each other's performances, steal secrets, ping pong the beautiful assistant Olivia between them as a lover.
I:15383;543;They intend to destroy one another, and one of them succeeds.
I:15383;544;"After the ""pledge"" to do something outrageous and the ""turn"" of events, the ""prestige"" is ""the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."""
I:15383;545;The Blu Ray for the prestige is GREAT!
I:15383;546;it had very good special features on how the movie was made and informative stuff about magicians at those times.
I:15383;547;Most importantly the film itself is brilliant!
I:15383;548;and i strongly recommend to anyone who likes to be blown away by a very unexpected ending!
I:15383;549;Keeps you guessing till the end and just when you think you've figured it out, you don't even come close!!
I:15383;550;Outstanding movie by a director who will be considered as a reference in a few years.
I:15383;551;And I like the peculiar world of magicians.
I:15383;552;The Prestige is the far better film in nearly every way.
I:15383;553;the acting is excellent (with the exception of David Bowie and his ridiculous Russian accent), the structure fantastic.
I:15383;554;"i love films like this that jump back and forth between events and time periods as long as the jumps are done so purposefully and not just to be ""artistic"" and Nolan does a very good job at this."
I:15383;555;The film also does a nice job of toying with the audiences emotions, making you root for one character one minute and then against the same character the next.
I:15383;556;One of the more intelligent and enjoyable films from '06 that I have seen.
I:15383;557;Great direction, plot, casting, dialogue, pacing, sets .
I:15383;558;other than children, this is the kind of movie that is a safe bet for just about anyone to enjoy.
I:15383;559;magical realism as a plot device, David Bowie as N Telsa.
I:15383;560;If you haven't seen it yet, just watch it!
I:15383;561;"they will do absolutely anything to ""win!"""
I:15383;562;What this film is really about can be summed up in four words .
I:15383;563;"Being famous, powerful, ""and the best"" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul!"
I:15383;564;His genius is absolutely fascinating.
I:15383;565;A decent little film that will keep you entertained, even if you, like I, work out the twist in the first five minutes.
I:15383;566;Michael Caine does his usual splendid job of subtly stealing every scene that he's in from the two leads and David Bowie makes a beautifully underplayed cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;567;For me, this was one of the most involving movies of 2006.
I:15383;568;I finally got it while in the theater parking lot.
I:15383;569;After realizing this, I gained a great appreciation of the writing and the direction.
I:15383;570;This is a movie you see with friends and can talk about for hours later.
I:15383;571;"Where ""The Illusionist"" is, at its core, a love story, ""The Prestige"" is about obsession and the lengths a person will go to in order to overcome a rival."
I:15383;572;Alfred is the best magician of the two but it is Angiers who is the best entertainer.
I:15383;573;Both men are determined to best the other's act, using sabatoge and deception if necessary.
I:15383;574;The story takes several twists and turns, making the viewer question each man's goodness.
I:15383;575;In the end, we find out the prestige (or final act) of both men, which I think is quite satisfying.
I:15383;576;bale and Jackman are terrific as the battling magicians.
I:15383;577;And Christopher Nolan, a talent director, gives the viewers yet an enteraining and well made film.
I:15383;578;i enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it to everyone.
I:15383;579;The Prestige is a masterpiece!
I:15383;580;Christopher Nolan lives up to, and exceeds, his reputation as one of today's most talented directors.you will not be disappointed!
I:15383;581;This is a very good movie and a good meystery.
I:15383;582;From what we could determine it seemed to have an interesting story and the acting we were able to hear and see seemed good.
I:15383;583;i see many favorable reviews and truly wished we could have enjoyed it too.
I:15383;584;A Good movie with a touch of Sci.
I:15383;585;It has Interesting twists and turns.
I:15383;586;It is worth the money.
I:15383;587;The Prestige is moviemaking at its best .
I:15383;588;engrossing story, fine acting, beautiful production, and a lingering presence in your mind long after the movie is over.
I:15383;589;I saw this in the theatre on New Year's Eve, and thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:15383;590;But I found it fascinating on every level, from its portrayal of century.
I:15383;591;ago theatre to the philosophical questions it raises at the end.
I:15383;592;One of the best movies of 2006.
I:15383;593;This is a great mystery movie where you're never sure who is more crazy.
I:15383;594;Nonetheless it was a fun movie and worth watching.
I:15383;595;some moderate suspense builds over the last half hour, and then the director reveals all kinds of coincidences and surprises and mysteries as if to apologize for the preceding 90 minutes.
I:15383;596;Ever since this movie came out, I've been in love with it.
I:15383;597;After two and a half years of pleading, I finally bought them their own copy on Blu.
I:15383;598;It is interesting to me to watch this movie after seeing The Illusionist for a second time this past week.
I:15383;599;The two movies have many similarities and are both quite good.
I:15383;600;I could tell you more of the story but I think its best to go into the movie knowing little like I did.
I:15383;601;beware, this is far from a straightforward movie.
I:15383;602;regardless of any twist, the movie has other merits as well.
I:15383;603;The production values are top notch, with every scene of the movie being eye candy, with lavish sets and amazing locations.
I:15383;604;(For some reason on my second viewing of the Illusionist Edward Norton's accent seemed to go in and out) I was really impressed with Bale and Jackman in this movie.
I:15383;605;some of the highlights include the electric field in Colorado, the many magic acts and the final twist.
I:15383;606;Overall this is a great movie that works on almost every level.
I:15383;607;See this in the theater for the amazing visuals.
I:15383;608;The Prestige is an interesting film, buoyed more by the stars than the script.
I:15383;609;"I really enjoyed it
I:15383;610;The wonderful, enduring Michael Caine .
I:15383;611;gives a strong performance, as usual, as the magical engineer behind Hugh Jackman's Rufus Angier.
I:15383;612;Jackman's beautiful, wonderful, so the movie's success rest heavily on his performance, and he does well in the lead.
I:15383;613;And the White Lord Ziggy, David Bowie, puts in a guest spot that is interesting, but again a bit of waste of his talent.
I:15383;614;Angier is the master showman.
I:15383;615;He has the beauty and grace to set up a trick, which is more than half of it's success.
I:15383;616;very interesting film, one worth watching again.
I:15383;617;But I still fill like the whole film is one big trick, just like the magic they perform.
I:15383;618;great cast, beautifully filmed, but covering up what they don't want you too see, that it's a bit more flash than substance.
I:15383;619;this movie was a great mystery thriller and not be missed!
I:15383;620;This film is OK but not Great.
I:15383;621;I like Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman so I wanted to like this film very much.
I:15383;622;. . . but it was worth watching once.
I:15383;623;The film offers an interesting concept, a double.
I:15383;624;twist of an ending, and an unexpected science fiction angle involving the real life genius Nikola Tesla (he really did wirelessly illuminate bulbs at a distance of 25 miles from his experimental station outside Colorado Springs).
I:15383;625;The Prestige isn't a riveting film, but it will keep your attention.
I:15383;626;are all worthwhile, especially the venerable Michael Caine, and the blu.
I:15383;627;The Prestige is a period piece fantasy made into something resembling reality.
I:15383;628;At its heart it relies on a device from science fiction, a machine that transports people and objects by replicating them.
I:15383;629;Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far.
I:15383;630;fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination.
I:15383;631;(And one for me would be nice as well.)
I:15383;632;The trick as performed is so much less amazing than the real magic that could have been displayed, that of replicating enormously complex objects like human beings.
I:15383;633;putting all this aside, the movie is entertaining and thought provoking.
I:15383;634;stirred delineation of the plot is done well and kept this viewer interested.
I:15383;635;I also liked the razor sharp psychological tension created between Borden and Angier as they compete against each other.
I:15383;636;And the many surprising plot twists and turns.
I:15383;637;something that Nolan does very well.
I:15383;638;and the cast was excellent.
I:15383;639;Michael Caine who plays the old magician and front man Cutter was perfect, and the glimpse or two we get of Scarlett Johansson was more than agreeable.
I:15383;640;Bale and Jackson were very good as well.
I:15383;641;But I especially liked Rebecca Hall who played Borden's wife Sarah.
I:15383;642;I thought she was outstanding.
I:15383;643;On the one hand there are Nolan's artistic films, Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002) and on the other hand there are his big screen commercial successes, this film and Batman Begins.
I:15383;644;In fact perhaps the best way to look at The Prestige and Batman Begins is to recognize that they are artistic films made within industry constraints that require mass market appeal.
I:15383;645;My friends and I chose to watch this at a small get together.
I:15383;646;Beautiful filming, great twists in the plot, LOVE the actors.
I:15383;647;Also loved who I bought it from.
I:15383;648;I thought this was an entertaining, engrossing film, with enough of a plot twist to keep us engaged, and a freshing formalism to the script .
I:15383;649;The acting was quite nice .
I:15383;650;although the younger actors are all a tad callow, Michael Caine and David Bowie were both delightful onscreen, each stealing the show in his own way.
I:15383;651;In my opinion good acting, interesting plot twists, a rational (if somewhat convoluted) plot line, some fascinating illusions, great period photography.
I:15383;652;Folks, science fiction is extrapolation of known science into realms of the possible.
I:15383;653;Too bad since I really wanted to enjoy this movie.
I:15383;654;This was the most amazing movie I have seen in sometime.
I:15383;655;I loved the mystery that was not revealed until the last scene.
I:15383;656;The plot of the movie is alittle slow to get going, but once it starts it is great and continually changing.
I:15383;657;The production value of this movie is excellent.
I:15383;658;I felt transported back to a time in history when science and superstition were practically brothers in the minds of most men.
I:15383;659;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry the film splendidly, even during the very slow moments, with Michael Caine and the lovely Scarlett Johansson pitching in occasionally to give the story added lift.
I:15383;660;"This is the second film that director Christopher Nolan has worked with Christian Bale, the first being ""Batman Begins"", and as in that film the photography in ""The Prestige"" is equally dark and evocative."
I:15383;661;"The pace of ""The Presitge"" is slow going, but I found the film overall to be very satisfying."
I:15383;662;I missed this movie in the theater, but I always wanted to see it.
I:15383;663;I can say it was a top notch production, with convincing performances and meticulous details, but it's not for everyone.
I:15383;664;Really is one of those movies you cant just watch one time.
I:15383;665;I find it very interesting and entertaining.
I:15383;666;One of the best movies I have seen in the past few years.
I:15383;667;The story, the acting, the visualization and the imagination makes this an instant classic.
I:15383;668;I thoroughly love watching The Prestige.
I:15383;669;Once in a while a great movie will come along that I can watch over and over and be entertained continuously.
I:15383;670;This is one of those films.
I:15383;671;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as the main characters and the plot is just wonderful.
I:15383;672;I imagine the book is just as great and I think that the film makers did a really nice job with the material.
I:15383;673;It's innovative, deceiving, thought provoking and overall excellently put together.
I:15383;674;I saw this in the theatre, and found myself discussing it with my fellow movie goers all the way home (30 minutes).
I:15383;675;Christopher Nolan has directed my two favorite movies, Memento and The Prestige.
I:15383;676;Mr. Nolan knows how to give you all of the info without giving you the key to figuring it out.
I:15383;677;"if you like magic, ""thinking movies"", movies with a twist, and paradoxes, you will love this movie."
I:15383;678;even David Bowie was great as the part of Nicola Tesla.
I:15383;679;this is a very entertaining movie top drawer in all aspects and bear in mind it is sci.
I:15383;680;anyway it is a must see in my opinion.
I:15383;681;The Prestige features an outstanding cast, a topic seemingly tailor.
I:15383;682;Some of the more clever plot twists, including the most important one, are obscured by the time changes.
I:15383;683;the movie is richly authentic in period detail and in the mechanics of the magician's trade.
I:15383;684;Michael Caine does fabulous work as a connecting thread in the story, providing the necessary explanation for some key scenes.
I:15383;685;David Bowie has a nice cameo as a scientist.
I:15383;686;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman nicely portray their respective social class differences.
I:15383;687;this movie is highly recommended as an entertaining story, especially for those with an interest in magic.
I:15383;688;The Prestige is a very entertaining, gripping film, which is rare for me these days, as sometimes I'm more tempted to stop a dull movie and go after more worthwhile pursuits.
I:15383;689;This prevents it from being a great movie.
I:15383;690;Nolan's choice to cast two men who appear physically similiar makes a statement.
I:15383;691;There's a great deal of overlap.
I:15383;692;"Happily, he does have more of a character than he did in ""Batman Begins,"" but he could have been a great supporting character."
I:15383;693;while you may figure out some of the plot as you go along, you'll feel compelled to keep watching.
I:15383;694;I love finding a surprisingly good film among the rubble, but how did I miss this one?I'd recorded 'The Prestige' from IFC.
I:15383;695;Nominated for two Academy Awards a few years back, the film features a great cast, a good story based on the magician trade, and a couple of really fun twists, although the final surprise didn't come through as strongly as the director may have wanted.
I:15383;696;Michael Caine is great, and Piper Perabo plays a small, but an endearing role.
I:15383;697;Very enjoyable, and now I know all about the draw, the turn, and the prestige.
I:15383;698;The mystery kept me guessing until the end.
I:15383;699;Great performances by Caine, Jackman and Bale.
I:15383;700;Everyone's favorite, the beautiful Johansson and her character could have been played by just about anyone in my opinion, but I think it was just the nature of the part.
I:15383;701;Lastly, was the great Tesla.
I:15383;702;The writer's (the Nolan brothers) knew what they were doing when they took on one of the most brilliant and mysterious men ever to live.
I:15383;703;The Great Bowie is indeed the only one who could play that part off just right.
I:15383;704;This is a great movie that keeps you guessing until the end!
I:15383;705;This movie is worth the money and then some!
I:15383;706;I admit, it is clever, though obvious.
I:15383;707;While I applaud this film in all its powerful efforts, including a brilliant.
I:15383;708;it is a good idea to compare Nolan's basic premise with the premises of other past films .
I:15383;709;It is brilliant, confusing, metaphysically challenging.
I:15383;710;Again, brilliant, clear and no tricks played on us but the tension in itself is a trick.
I:15383;711;This is a real condition, and we watch as the film tracks backward through time to tell us how it all came to this.
I:15383;712;The entire film is like watching a marvelous stage illusion because that is what the plot and storyline really are.
I:15383;713;It's as if the viewer is the detective, seeing the answers unfold in a proper narrative .
I:15383;714;That is the delight: the trick was we started out thinking we'd never get it.
I:15383;715;The viewer, who is watching an objective narrative, actually begins to wonder if it is all a trick or what.
I:15383;716;You will note, each film I suggested to you above has its payoff, and one does not have to bust open one's head to understand what's being shown.
I:15383;717;In other words, to borrow Hitchcock's term, in the great films, we 'get' the MacGuffin even if we have to wait a bit.
I:15383;718;apropos of the preceding, THE PRESTIGE truly insults the wonderful, hard work of Tesla, and the work of magicians everywhere.
I:15383;719;michael Caine and Andy Serkis are stellar and well worth seeing, the era portrayed has a convincing feel which is not easy to convey.
I:15383;720;I love movies that make you think, and this one did not fail to do so.
I:15383;721;It is very well done and is great at keeping you guessing throughout the duration.
I:15383;722;Well, of course its great, it was directed by Christopher Nolan!
I:15383;723;It is very interesting, It doesn't take itself too seriously, it adds a little drama, and in the end, you start to question the two main characters.
I:15383;724;a fine novel turned into a finer film by the Nolan brothers.
I:15383;725;In the theatres, the film captures our imaginations as it should.
I:15383;726;So now, a few years beyond this, we have the BD.
I:15383;727;"Don't get me wrong
I:15383;728;the Nolens are amazing magicians of film, and I hope they may allow for more of their own impressions to be made once their films gain their next life, beyond the lifespan of the theatre.
I:15383;729;I would go with the upgrade, simply for the magnificence of the production value sunk into the sets, costumes, lighting and music.
I:15383;730;My wife keeps bringing home Hugh Jackman movies from work.
I:15383;731;"When I ask her about it she just shrugs and says ""he's cute"" and adopts this wispy, far."
I:15383;732;"pocus infused movie that is ""The Prestige""."
I:15383;733;I have not read the book which the movie was based upon, and I feel it's important to mention this because I tend to feel you can't really give the movie a fair shake until you've read the source material it's based upon.
I:15383;734;"the movie stars Christian ""Batman"" Bale and Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman as two competing magicians circa the turn of the 20th century."
I:15383;735;The movie is very dark in nature and explores how far our obsessions will make us go.
I:15383;736;This, coupled with the already mystical nature of the illusory magic trade, makes for a gritty and otherworldly combination.
I:15383;737;This is something that's going to appeal strongly to certain people and completely turn off others.
I:15383;738;Visually this is an eye.
I:15383;739;The effects are dazzling and the cinematography is spectacular.
I:15383;740;Tesla's machine is probably the most impressive sequence in the lot and really brings much to the movie.
I:15383;741;I'd love to see this in the Blu Ray format, at least certain scenes of the movie.
I:15383;742;"Even she said ""Ok, that's it."
I:15383;743;The movie gets points for being engaging and dramatic, and for makingyou think a bit in order to follow the chopped up timeline.
I:15383;744;The moviegets a bonus point for honoring the great Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;745;Jackman and Baledo good work, as of course does Sir Caine.
I:15383;746;Finnaly, David Bowie nailed Tesla, great work.
I:15383;747;A brilliant story, a stellar cast and a director with more than one ace up his sleeve.
I:15383;748;Prestige impressed me more than many of the other more popular and critically hailed films of 2006.
I:15383;749;The story immediately drew me in and I was constantly surprised at its twist and turns.
I:15383;750;larger than cameo role is a delicious surprise.
I:15383;751;A great showman in a film about great showman.
I:15383;752;one has to love the irony.
I:15383;753;lastly, the brilliant Christian Bale continues to show he is very close to the top of that list of go.
I:15383;754;"Bale just churns out one complex and intelligent performance (""The Machinist""), while managing to stuff the box office with favorites like ""Batman Returns""."
I:15383;755;"I am convinced that Bale can do it al
I:15383;756;"What is more amazing is he has been doing this since he was a child (giving a stellar performance in ""Empire of the Sun"")."
I:15383;757;worthy, and I am sure that the golden statue will one day grace his mantle.
I:15383;758;This was, hands down, one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:15383;759;(As I did with Nolan's other remarkable film, Memento.)
I:15383;760;I was completely caught up in the mood of the film, a subtle mixture of repressed emotion and obsession, and in the acting, which was just marvellous.
I:15383;761;Obsession, as Michael Caine points out, is a young man's game.
I:15383;762;"the caged birds, the multiple hats (Jackman and Bale ""wore"" several), the intricate interweaving between the magic of science, and the trickery of magic."
I:15383;763;The film successfully conveyed the complex metaphors of Christopher Priest's book without losing any of its entertainment value.
I:15383;764;the Prestige is tight, well acted, beautifully filmed, carefully thought out, intelligent, and captivating.
I:15383;765;A little dark and mixes up history a bit, but great performances make this very engaging retro.
I:15383;766;Michael Cane is great as always
I:15383;767;definitely Recommend this one for your collection.
I:15383;768;I love the historical information and the twists in this movie, it kept me interested for the entire film, LOVE IT and I'm so glad I was able to find it after years of looking.
I:15383;769;It has great acting and the story goes places you wouldn't expect.
I:15383;770;I love this movie, Hugh jackman is awesome crazy amazing one of the best magicians in a movie the prestige
I:15383;771;I really enjoyed this movie and it's great that I'm able to watch it in mi mini iPad, I look forward to obtain more of my favorite movies for download.
I:15383;772;A unique movie worth watching twice.You do need to pay attention, especially in the beginning to understand what's going on.
I:15383;773;But it's extrememly entertaining, artistic, and the acting of Caine, Jackman and Bale is just exquisite.
I:15383;774;see also highly recommended: THE ASYLUM w. Natasha Richardson and Sir Ian McKellan
I:15383;775;The Prestige is a wonderful example of how cinema is supposed to be made.
I:15383;776;Academy nominaded for Cinamatography is a true tribute to the tone of the film.
I:15383;777;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale bounce off each other great and Michael Caine in the middle makes it work even better.
I:15383;778;The film really shines in its directorial vision of Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;779;"Some of you might know him best from ""Batman Begins"" but he has done great films like ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia""."
I:15383;780;He has worked with the best in the buisness and his career is just begining.
I:15383;781;Good luck and I hope you enjoy this thriller/mystery/drama.
I:15383;782;As a huge Christian bale fan I had to have this movie when I saw that it was on sale for Cyber Monday.
I:15383;783;I definitely recommend it for movie.
I:15383;784;After telling my father all the great thing I'd heard about the movie, and its considerably high position on IMDB, he decided to watch it with me.
I:15383;785;I mean good gosh, while this movie is at least a good two hours, it feels like you're watching a Peter Jackson movie.
I:15383;786;But, on terms of mood, the movie achieves what it's going after, and the amazing visual effects only compliment it even further.
I:15383;787;And again, Nolan knows how to create the mood he wants.
I:15383;788;And of course, by the end, nobody wins.
I:15383;789;Sure Christopher Nolan is good, at creating the mood of the movie, but it's not really a great mood.
I:15383;790;I've seen this movie before and it is a great movie.
I:15383;791;David Bowie steals scenes as Tesla.
I:15383;792;An intricate tale of love, deceit, revenge, mystery and magic.
I:15383;793;In a world of illusions and misdirection this movie will keep you guessing until the very end.
I:15383;794;I thought the story line was excellent, and very well acted.
I:15383;795;In my opinion it's a pretty good movie, and will watch this one again.
I:15383;796;elegant Victorian thriller about magicians is so contorted with twists and turns of plot that it is almost incomprehensible.
I:15383;797;undertone made me stand back, as it were, and take a closer look.
I:15383;798;"I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year ."
I:15383;799;there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.
I:15383;800;Awesome acting except for Bale's accent.
I:15383;801;Terrific plot, neat costumes and wonderfully imaginable cinematography.
I:15383;802;Although, I already knew the details of the plot, that it was the story of two rival magicians in 19th Century London, and the secrets of each of their magic tricks, I still found this film to be well worth watching.
I:15383;803;As usual, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Cain also turn in excellent performances (when I read the book, I wondered if Nolan had been correct to cast Bale as Bowden and Jackman as Angier .
I:15383;804;but after seeing the film, I think he got it right).
I:15383;805;this movie is well worth watching, and if you haven't read the book, it is probably worth watching twice, just to see what you missed the first time around.
I:15383;806;LIke how Al Pacino and John Cazale also did Dog Day Afternoon in.
I:15383;807;well, the Prestige is the Dog Day Afternoon of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale.
I:15383;808;Lots of familiar Dark Knight faces return.
I:15383;809;sensical, and David Bowie makes a surprise appearance, though you'll be surprised at who he plays.
I:15383;810;Plot: Clever idea to have two ways of doing the same trick.
I:15383;811;The rivalry between the two magicians was really something fierce.
I:15383;812;science Fiction: It was a brilliant idea to present Tesla as the inventor.
I:15383;813;He invented so many incredible things, that if a teleporter could be made at that time, then he's probably the one to do it.
I:15383;814;actors: Both Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine are among my favorite actors, and they did not disappoint me.
I:15383;815;clarity of presentation: Only a grade of B.
I:15383;816;this is truly one of my favorite films.
I:15383;817;Bale is terrific as always as Alfred Borden, and Jackman delivers what I consider to be his finest performance as the obsessive, vindictive Robert Angier.
I:15383;818;Michael Caine's supporting role as Angier's ingenieur of allusions is a charming and vital, as the opening and closing narration are provided by his character.
I:15383;819;The lovely Scarlett Johansson also delivers one of the finest performances of her young career.
I:15383;820;The book goes into great and fascinating detail about the pasts of the two main characters, which was, in my opinion, a major omission from the film.
I:15383;821;Overall, the film is terrific.
I:15383;822;If you were fascinated by the film, I highly recommend that you delve into the book, which provides much greater insight into the characters.
I:15383;823;this is one of the best movies i've ever seen .
I:15383;824;This movie follows two budding magicians who become fiercely competitive and willing to make enormous sacrifices to perfect their craft and outshine the other.
I:15383;825;Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Cane do a superb job in their roles.
I:15383;826;This movie has intrigue, suspense, romance, and intelligence.
I:15383;827;Be prepared for a major twist at the end.
I:15383;828;From the opening shot it has you.
I:15383;829;Bale and Jackman are fantastic as always.
I:15383;830;which is the greater achievement?
I:15383;831;the movie kept me guessing on how some of the magic was done.
I:15383;832;The cast worked well together.
I:15383;833;I really enjoyed this movie, partly because I'm in Colorado Springs (prominently featured), and partly because a significant character is Nikolai Tesla, one of history's greatest geniuses.
I:15383;834;aside from that, it was extremely entertaining with a mind.
I:15383;835;The Prestige is another example of Hollywood's bent perspective being cast on the audience.
I:15383;836;Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have collaborated on previous projects (namely the brilliant MEMENTO) and here take on Christopher Priest's dazzling novel THE PRESTIGE.
I:15383;837;are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks.
I:15383;838;The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman.
I:15383;839;Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast.
I:15383;840;The production values are what really make the film work.
I:15383;841;Worth an evening's viewing .
I:15383;842;Need to watch it more than once.
I:15383;843;this movie is definitely for thinkers and detail oriented individuals.
I:15383;844;Gonna have to throw Caine's performance in with that of Bale's as well.
I:15383;845;The story however has moments of interest of the kind that decent science fiction is likely to arouse.
I:15383;846;David Bowie actually put in a pretty good performance as Dr Tesla.
I:15383;847;do you have the right to do it?
I:15383;848;it's a half decent film with some entertainment value, but if it won any awards for acting I would be extremely surprised.
I:15383;849;He brings to the audience a new and unfamiliar meaning to this word, as he illustrates this through his mastery of storytelling.
I:15383;850;When a magic performance turns tragic both men will go to the extreme of undermining each other to become the best magician.
I:15383;851;When Angier meets the scientist Nikola Tesla, he will fine the answer through the device that Tesla makes for him.
I:15383;852;"christopher Nolan is an exceptional director, who gives the audience his fourth movie entitled ""The Prestige."""
I:15383;853;"Nolan's style of directing and writing is much like the movie ""The Illusionist"" who keeps the audience guessing until the end."
I:15383;854;this is done quite effectively through the acting of Bale and Jackman.
I:15383;855;They completely become immersed in their passion that they have for their magic.
I:15383;856;the Verdict:This is very good film that deals with magic and showmanship but finds an underlining theme to the movie such as obsession.
I:15383;857;"If your fan of Christopher Nolan and like solving puzzle based movies then you will definitely appreciate ""The Prestige"" in which I highly recommend."
I:15383;858;The movie itself is great and you should definately watch it.
I:15383;859;Is 'The Prestige' worth seeing?
I:15383;860;Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Cain all do a very good job, as does Rebecca Hall as the love.
I:15383;861;"The overall idea of the script is terrific, although the dialogue is occasionally left wanting and ""what's coming next"" is a bit too obvious in places."
I:15383;862;Still, the twist at the end is very good, and worth the build up.
I:15383;863;If you are a Christian Bale or Hugh Jackman fan, though, or know someone who is, this IS a pretty good example of their work to add to your collection or give as a gift.
I:15383;864;Wow, what a breath of fresh air this film is.
I:15383;865;One of the most intelligent and twisting scripts in years filled with fantastic performances, particularly from Christian Bale.
I:15383;866;Just like magic itself, this film captivates our imagination and love of the extraordinary and leaves us with an impression that we have just seen something wonderful and whether or not the reality we are presented with is indeed true.
I:15383;867;Far superior to the Illusionist on every level.
I:15383;868;Very good script, intrigue and acting.
I:15383;869;"If you have appreciated ""The Illusionist"", you will certainly love this movie."
I:15383;870;It will keep you on your seat till the very surprising ending !
I:15383;871;Great acting, Great dialogue and a great story about two men with an obsession that drives them to the point of insanity.
I:15383;872;Its a very deep, involving movie, full of twists and turns.
I:15383;873;"the one thing that stands out is David Bowie's solid performance as Nikola Tesla, who was ""spooky"" smart in real life."
I:15383;874;I rarely see a film that is this well put together with such a great cast.
I:15383;875;Hugh Jackman's performance was great, starting off as the protagonist of the movie who let obsession turn him into a monster.
I:15383;876;Christian Bale puts in another great performance as the rival illusionist.
I:15383;877;also, After I watched this movie, I was curious about the scene with the cat.
I:15383;878;"I think it was a clever reference to ""Schrodinger's cat"" ."
I:15383;879;up to the reinvigoration of Batman is a classy suspense thriller that is complex and intriguing.
I:15383;880;layered mystery (or is it mysteries?)
I:15383;881;Hugh Jackman does a spot.
I:15383;882;on American accent, while Scarlett Johannsson and Piper Perabo do equally impressive British accents.
I:15383;883;Academy Award winner Sir Michael Caine rounds out the main cast, with singer David Bowie (HOLY SMOKES!!!)
I:15383;884;"written film, with plenty of twists and ""Turn""s to keep the audience spell."
I:15383;885;If you think you know how good the Nolan Brothers are together, see where it all began: with The Prestige.
I:15383;886;I enjoy period movies and books especially those around the turn of the (last) century, so I was drawn to this movie.
I:15383;887;The plot was fascinating and the acting was excellent.
I:15383;888;The storyline was well done as well.
I:15383;889;i recommend this movie to those with a bent towards period pieces and the accompanying accents and outifts.
I:15383;890;For me, this was a very enjoyable 4 star film.
I:15383;891;It is similar to The Illusionist because both men are magicians and there is some suspense.
I:15383;892;THE PRESTIGE is the year's best film.
I:15383;893;Yet,it is definitely the most intelligent film I have seen in 2006 .
I:15383;894;a year where a dozen great films came out.
I:15383;895;hugh Jackman did 4 films this year and this one is without the blossom of a doubt, his best performance till date.
I:15383;896;"I ""didn't"" think too highly of him (Considering he's done a film called Van Helsing
I:15383;897;The real charm lies in the manner in which the actor uses his arms, legs, speech, movements, reactions, etc. to actually make a point to an unsuspecting crowd.
I:15383;898;You see, I had never seen a Christian Bale film (Surprise!)
I:15383;899;The direction is immaculate and will make the hair on your back stand.
I:15383;900;it's quite humorous that Amazon forget to include Scarlett Johansson's name on the main page (film cast) She did a good job, her role was limited but it is always good to see someone so beautiful perform in a film as good as The Prestige.
I:15383;901;In all likeliness, Prestige will restore your faith in films even if it wasn't really lost.
I:15383;902;A lot of us including me guessed the twist towards the end but that still was only a part of the bigger twist altogether.
I:15383;903;The best scenes in the film include the following .
I:15383;904;overall, I'd like to say that this film as good as it is, is because it is the kind of film you want to see do good and it does just that.
I:15383;905;Not only is it a better, more creative, more captivating film but it's also a bigger film on the whole.
I:15383;906;Nonetheless, both films are definitely worth watching a few times over.
I:15383;907;Here Christopher Nolan has created a story that both socks and mystifies the viewer and treats them as intelligent human beings.
I:15383;908;Every detail is put to good use as Christopher Nolan combines history with fiction.
I:15383;909;It's worth a million bucks but I only has to pay 1.99
I:15383;910;The magic of this movie is its blend of the fantasy and that of the Stage Magician.
I:15383;911;"The Prestige was such an act but unlike ""The Illusionist"" it took a fantasy turn at the end, like something out of H. G. Wells, where fantastic things happen out of science but they have unexpected results."
I:15383;912;I did enjoy the mystery of the plot.
I:15383;913;i thought the acting was believable.
I:15383;914;Bale and Jakeman were very good as the rivals, both bent on ruining each other for the purpose of vengence but the fantasy ending was unexpected.
I:15383;915;But then that was true until I remembered that the time setting, and therefore was in perfect harmony of the turn of the century of 1900 era, when technology, as represented by Tesla was new and very mysterious.
I:15383;916;The Prestige stands as a successful film in the sense that it delivers what it promises to the audience: a challenging and fun mystery (how did Bale and Jackman pull off their respective Transporting Man tricks?)
I:15383;917;, believable tension between the two male leads, a worthwhile side story involving Bale's wife and Johanson, and a very very good red herring in Tesla.
I:15383;918;And the director juggles all these elements succesfully so that the end product is a film that masterfully balances all these into a cohesive story.
I:15383;919;By the end of the film, when all is revealed, you see how far the two men have gone to fulfill their goals and you can almost hear the mental click as everything comes together into a whole piece.
I:15383;920;in any case, overall the Prestige is a very good flick, and certainly worth a view.
I:15383;921;This is an engaging, well.
I:15383;922;acted and exceedingly clever film.
I:15383;923;I highly recommend it (and really, when else are you going to find Batman, Alfred, Wolverine, Ziggy Stardust and Black Widow all in one place?)
I:15383;924;"star, REALLY HOT, awesome cast
I:15383;925;I would have enjoyed it more had I fast forwarded through most of it.
I:15383;926;really, really loved this film!
I:15383;927;Love Thom York's tune at the end, he's the best and it fit perfectly with the whole vibe.
I:15383;928;This was a fascinating film.
I:15383;929;Definitely the type you'll want to watch a second time.
I:15383;930;The plot is clever and compelling, and David Bowie even makes an appearance.
I:15383;931;Great movie, you won't expect the end, it has a good twist but I liked the illusionist way better lol.
I:15383;932;All act of magic has three moments.
I:15383;933;Two brilliant magicians face to face, one each another trying to show the world who's the best.
I:15383;934;Each own has his secrets and this growing rivalry will lead to unsuspected levels of tension and suspense.
I:15383;935;Scarlet Johanson is a smart device among them and Michael Caine like the smart engineer conform a team hard to improve in this extraordinary and original film who will engage you from start to finish.
I:15383;936;because at the end of the projection this portrait is also the magic of cinema.
I:15383;937;"The special effects are just illusion
I:15383;938;watch it and you'll see why 5 stars
I:15383;939;The Pretige now become my favorite movie.
I:15383;940;The movie is well made!
I:15383;941;Great screenplay, cinematography, sound, cast and editing.
I:15383;942;the prestige is a magic treat, a love for magic so deep they sacrifice everything and anything to be the best.
I:15383;943;this is a keeper, the cast is great, the acting, the story, very suprising in the end.
I:15383;944;the cast alone you knew you were in for a treat.
I:15383;945;hugh jackman is one of the best actors out there.
I:15383;946;i love all of his movies and in this film his gift is clearly seen.
I:15383;947;he has a load of good movies under his belt as well.
I:15383;948;his acting speaks for itself, and his accent is nice.
I:15383;949;scarlett johanssen played her part very well.
I:15383;950;and in the end only the best will triumph.
I:15383;951;all it was said to be and more theres so much beauty and talent throughout the whole movie you just want to watch it again and again.
I:15383;952;"The magic was historic and accurate for the era (though lots of modernism and creative license was used to entertain the crowds of today, who wouldn't sit through the longer ""older"" presentations)."
I:15383;953;I found the subject matter (Magic) to be interesting and the film also had some historical validity because it concerned itself with the time frame in history when electricity was being introduced into the lives of the common man and women.
I:15383;954;The film touched upon the fascination that many of us have with magic which brings back memories of childhood, and also sparking the scientific curiosity that also dwells in some of us.
I:15383;955;The fact that the film concerned itself with Nicola Tesla shocked me , and I very much liked the climax of the movie.
I:15383;956;Great story line and fantastic acting.
I:15383;957;bale and Jackman are fantastic.
I:15383;958;its a thriller and sci.
I:15383;959;such a great storyline with a great twist at the end.
I:15383;960;The Illusionist is way much better to compare with.
I:15383;961;I personally will NOT recommend this movie to be in your collection.
I:15383;962;Great movie that's about all I can say it simply amazing, the twist and turns the whole ride was just epic if your a fan of inception or shutter island it has a similar feel.
I:15383;963;done movie that keeps you thinking after you've watched it.
I:15383;964;Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.
I:15383;965;The Prestige fits clearly into the Enlightenment setting.
I:15383;966;There is a rational explanation for everything.
I:15383;967;the philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling.
I:15383;968;Nolan is conveying a message that our senses deceive us, both in the setting with the illusionists and the view that people aren't always what they appear to be either.
I:15383;969;"i personally consider this to be both more realistic than ""The Illusionist"" and a better made movie."
I:15383;970;"That said, I enjoyed ""The Illusionist"" more than this movie."
I:15383;971;i saw this film after my University lectures, which had gone on long enough, had finished and was looking forward to ending the day with a very well made film as I enjoyed Nolan's' Batman Begins and Memento.
I:15383;972;The film was outstanding and leaves you with a great ending twist.
I:15383;973;after leaving the cinema, I was not at all disappointed and I enjoyed it tremendously and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.
I:15383;974;Great drama, emotion and the tension between the two rivals of Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman and Alfred Borden played by Christian Bale.
I:15383;975;The acts performed by these two rivals, though seeming like an 'old trick', is interesting to see how the earlier work of magicians like to baffle the audience before the turn of the century.
I:15383;976;"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is re."
I:15383;977;The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain.
I:15383;978;"although this type of film may feel like the type played by Christian Bale, but not Hugh Jackman
I:15383;979;It's a great way to show their acting ability in a film that doesn't usually conform to the types of a film in cinema today.
I:15383;980;the feel/tone of the film is based on their amounting and rising tension between the two rivals for an amazing magic trick.
I:15383;981;This can be more interesting than that of the actual trick.
I:15383;982;The tricks may seem old and antiquated, but the idea on how the two discover and elude each other is far more interesting.
I:15383;983;previously working on 'Batman Begins', Michael Caine pulls out a great supporting role of the character Cutter and assistant of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).
I:15383;984;He this time chooses to work with Hugh as his trick set.
I:15383;985;She eventually plays Angier's assistant to, as well as steal Borden secrets, his love interest.
I:15383;986;While we focus on Jackmans' part, we see how Borden, played by Bale, is coping with an ever growing jealously and pride while his rival is making new performances and while his family life also faces crisis.
I:15383;987;The two both read each other's journals, eluding each other, and striving ambition begins to show more and more between them.
I:15383;988;They compliment each other brilliantly.
I:15383;989;They must have had enormous respect and patience with Nolan.
I:15383;990;I love this kind of movie, it blow your mind.
I:15383;991;Good price and excellent service.
I:15383;992;What can I say, this movie is one of the greatest as far as I'm concerned.
I:15383;993;i was happy to see that they could not only separate the elements, but combine them as well.
I:15383;994;i won't mention what that magic twist was, but it was a great combination of the real and fake magic that really made it work for me.
I:15383;995;magicians who basically perform all the way throughout their lives.
I:15383;996;that element right there is a nice thought.
I:15383;997;above all, i liked the sci.
I:15383;998;fi twist that actually seemed realistic by the way it was created.
I:15383;999;if you are at all into magic, you will probably enjoy this.
I:15383;1000;i liked this better then the illusionist, and i loved that movie.
I:15383;1001;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were intense and brillant in their performance.
I:15383;1002;Great magic performances by both
I:15383;1003;I truely enjoyed this movie.
I:15383;1004;Action,suspense,drama and a unpredictable ending.
I:15383;1005;Very enjoyable film in my view with a good plot and a fair few twists and turns along the way.
I:15383;1006;Very good acting on the whole from all the cast and in particular from Jackman and Caine.
I:15383;1007;Worth a watch for sure.
I:15383;1008;But for real this guy wow what a movie love it and can not say any thing els
I:15383;1009;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are great along with Michael Cain and David Bowie.
I:15383;1010;Exciting and full of twists!
I:15383;1011;The tagline on the movie says that once you see it you will want to immediately see it again.
I:15383;1012;This is a must see a minimum of two times and is very entertaining.
I:15383;1013;I loved his first indie.
I:15383;1014;twists abound, gone is the fun and sense of wonder both from the world of magic as well as Nolan's filmmaking.
I:15383;1015;What follows is a series of elaborate illusions, sabotages, seductions, and finally murder as each magician tries to ruin the other while seeking to discover the secrets behind the other's illusions.
I:15383;1016;This sounds like a promising story and at first it's quite engaging with great period detail (of turn.
I:15383;1017;century England and America) and some clever behind.
I:15383;1018;scenes insights to the magic tricks of it's era.
I:15383;1019;Some people thought the big reveal at the end was clever.
I:15383;1020;the one thing Christopher Nolan excells at in all his films is his casting.
I:15383;1021;Both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are well cast and convincing as the two (unlikeable) magicians.
I:15383;1022;Michael Caine is a welcome presence as Cutter, an engineer who knew both men but works mostly for Angier.
I:15383;1023;Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Olivia, Angier's assistant who falls for Borden.
I:15383;1024;Surprisingly, David Bowie and Andy Serkis give the best performances in the movie as Nikola Tesla and his assistant Mr. Alley.
I:15383;1025;I like the idea of using stage magic as a movie theme and this film started out really strong.
I:15383;1026;"little noticed ""Memento"" many of us held our breath for the next construct of Christian Nolan's creative direction ."
I:15383;1027;and the wait was rewarded with brilliance.
I:15383;1028;"Nolan selected a great story, ""The Prestige"" which is impossible to transfer to a silver screen (or more and more, a digital one) and transformed it into a screenplay that communicates brilliantly from the screen, providing a riveting study of human interaction and truly obsessive/compulsive behavior."
I:15383;1029;nineteenth century characters, but two brilliant performances (despite Bale's inability to maintain a non.
I:15383;1030;The twists and turns of plot are thrilling and the use of a technological miracle la H. g. Wells is almost credible.
I:15383;1031;But if you are a buff of mystery, of period drama, of directorial excellence and consummate acting, this is a movie you will not just enjoy, but pull every once in a while from your library to enjoy yet again, even knowing the outcome.
I:15383;1032;the subtle nuances aside, the movie was brilliantly done, and Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine as well as Scarlett Johansson all deserve much praise for this plot.
I:15383;1033;whether you watched it, or watch it after purchasing it now, and watch it for the magic, or the wizardry of thes powerful men, you will love its suspense and plot.
I:15383;1034;Great plot, acting, and filming.
I:15383;1035;made movie takes place in the late 19th / early 20th centuries and paints an excellent picture(as far as I can tell) of what Victorian Era theater magic was like.
I:15383;1036;Its complex structure requires that you pay pretty close attention, but if you do its plot is easy to follow.
I:15383;1037;"in short, this is by far the best ""murder mystery"" i've ever seen, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes movies that twist and turn about, make you think, AND still make sense in the end(that last one is rare)."
I:15383;1038;I've rambled on enough here, so until next time, you stay classy _________(your city's name here)
I:15383;1039;This is one of the better movies.
I:15383;1040;well scripted, great cast, great acting.
I:15383;1041;This movie was captivating and enthralling.
I:15383;1042;One of the best movies I have watched in a very long time.
I:15383;1043;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both have stellar performances throughout this movie.
I:15383;1044;with a twist at the end that will leave everyone stunned!
I:15383;1045;The rivalry between the two magicians is fantastic.
I:15383;1046;It keeps the tension and action riveting, sometimes brutal and sometimes comical.
I:15383;1047;It is also a pretty good example of the movie being more compelling than the book.
I:15383;1048;Well acted, with beautiful photography, settings, and costumes.
I:15383;1049;An interesting story with compelling plot twists.
I:15383;1050;It is also a mystery, and I was trying to guess the answer all along.
I:15383;1051;"First, it implies that all science is a form of magic with no logic to it
I:15383;1052;And that is the main problem of the film: it suchers you into thinking it will deliver the profound truth and then you find out you've been conned by charlatans.
I:15383;1053;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:15383;1054;I thought I had it figured out, but continued to be very surprised, all the way up until the shocking ending!
I:15383;1055;He is a great actor and really goes the extra mile for his audience.
I:15383;1056;The entire cast does a wonderful job with this one.
I:15383;1057;This wonderful tale of two battling magicians is too wonderfully complex to describe.
I:15383;1058;The act of magic is described in its three parts .
I:15383;1059;"the pledge, in which the audience is introduced to an object of interest
I:15383;1060;But superb writing keeps the audience guessing through a maze of false appearances and hidden motivations.
I:15383;1061;Like a real magic trick, the viewer wonders how it was done .
I:15383;1062;The stakes are high: the revelation of Borden's greatest trick .
I:15383;1063;has perfected the trick .
I:15383;1064;spooky electronics genius Nicola Tesla.
I:15383;1065;The Prestige is itself one enormous illusion.
I:15383;1066;This required a prodigious feat of intelligent writing, but it is pulled off admirably.
I:15383;1067;One of the movie's special pleasures is to rewatch it knowing how the illusions are done.
I:15383;1068;"Amazingly, character motivations and actions that ""read"" one way the first time, read perfectly well in the opposite direction as well."
I:15383;1069;michael Caine was a standout in the film .
I:15383;1070;his sullen stage manner made one wonder how his character became so famous.
I:15383;1071;Bale was alternately an emotional cipher and an engaging husband, father and magician.
I:15383;1072;David Bowie made the most amazing, low.
I:15383;1073;He was mysterious, spookily intelligent and convincingly obsessed with his inventions.
I:15383;1074;it is easy to see that Hugh's character is the more polished of the two, and yet it isn't enough.
I:15383;1075;Christian knows how to perform incredibly clever illusions which seem to dazzle way more than anything Hugh can come up with.
I:15383;1076;Thus the quest to *discover* Christian's secret ferments until it becomes a full.
I:15383;1077;His experiments with electricity has made him legendary, but also viewed as a bit of an eccentric as well.
I:15383;1078;i also feel compelled to let those who see this movie know that the plot borders on the Supernatural and even skirts the realm of science fiction a tad.
I:15383;1079;maybe because of these two factors I was able to make my deduction so easily (because I enjoy sci.
I:15383;1080;I still enjoyed the acting, the pacing and it is always nice to see Michael Caine do what he does best .
I:15383;1081;even if his role reminded me of a dozen other characters he has played in the past.
I:15383;1082;Good luck, and hopefully the ending WILL surprise you more than it did me.
I:15383;1083;As story begins the two men are partners as well as rival up starts working for another magician.
I:15383;1084;Each trick has three parts the pledge, the turn and the most important, the Prestige.
I:15383;1085;"Cain's character ""Cutter"" knows the talent of these two men and tried to coach them on the finer aspects of being a magician."
I:15383;1086;"nolan weaves a sophisticated story that keeps you on on the edge of your proverbial seat and like a magic trick
I:15383;1087;The entire movie is like a magic trick, you begin with the pledge and then the turn and in the finally.
I:15383;1088;the Prestige!One of the smartest things in the entire movie is the practical approach to showing how the tricks are performed and the idea that the trick is almost always much more simple than one would think.
I:15383;1089;nolan does again, a remarkable job with humanizing the characters evolved and shows how much they are willing to risk for there obsessions.
I:15383;1090;Each man is obsessed with knowing he is better than the other, and will stop at nothing till he has the superior trick that leaves not only the audience scratching their heads but his rival as well.
I:15383;1091;in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2006 and even thou nominated for two Oscars, was over looked by most movie goes and critics.
I:15383;1092;The acting in the Prestige is brilliant without being too bold.
I:15383;1093;the mark of any great movie is how many times it takes you to watch it and catch something new and at the same time be entertained.
I:15383;1094;This movie solidifies for me the genius that is Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who wrote the screenplay).
I:15383;1095;A master storyteller and knows exactly how much to show and when to show it.
I:15383;1096;this movie is the newest addition to my top 100 movies and my favorite movie of 2006
I:15383;1097;This movie has quickly become one of my favorites due to what I feel is a very strong story and some convincing acting.
I:15383;1098;Throw in some nice special effects and the movie itself is great.
I:15383;1099;I bought this partly because of the story line, and mostly because of the three leading male stars, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine.
I:15383;1100;A First Class, highly detailed period piece set in the most part in the UK, it portrays at first the professional friendship, then the falling.
I:15383;1101;The script writers partnered with the director really did a class.
I:15383;1102;"act job on this film using a finely crafted ""flashback"" technique, leaving VERY subtle hints/links throughout the story line that."
I:15383;1103;all come together at the wholly unexpected plot twist during the climax.
I:15383;1104;The prestige is a beautiful film, that draws you into the stage of magic, in a world on the verge of a technological change.
I:15383;1105;"Directed by Christopher Nolan, and filled with his usual plethora of fine actors
I:15383;1106;Most of the drama is portrayed between the bitter conflict between veteran magician Robert Angier played by the very talented Hugh Jackman and the two.
I:15383;1107;sided, mysterious magician Alfred Borden played convincingly by Christian Bale.
I:15383;1108;from beginning to end, The Prestige is magical.
I:15383;1109;You are presented with nuances that give hidden clues that make rewatching it even more enjoyable.
I:15383;1110;The haunting loss for Robert is played with emotion and lorn by Jackman, and I give him high praise.
I:15383;1111;But Alfred has more than just revenge in mind.
I:15383;1112;His true, masterpiece, is to see Alfred's newest magic trick stolen.
I:15383;1113;The magic trick, to the dismay of Robert, is an incredible act.
I:15383;1114;How is it done, and what is the prestige?The Prestige is an amazing work, done by a gifted director.
I:15383;1115;The acting is a real high point, and the story and material, as presented, was absorbing to begin with and required no mercy from the viewer to take charm.
I:15383;1116;I was not thrilled by the description, but from the first gorgeous scene, and the story beginning with the end, is very interesting and thrilling.
I:15383;1117;I recommend this well made film.
I:15383;1118;I thought it was intriguing.
I:15383;1119;I loved the mystic of magic.
I:15383;1120;"If you like this movie you'll love ""The Illusionist"" even better."
I:15383;1121;This movie has certainly captured the art of magic, its complexities and wonder.
I:15383;1122;This storytelling is efficient and compelling.
I:15383;1123;they really have something to evoke every audience.
I:15383;1124;This fact will put you to the edge until the cessation.
I:15383;1125;Furthermore, the director presented the theme.
I:15383;1126;"This film exposes one of the best ""rivalry"" stories I have seen for some time."
I:15383;1127;As always, Bale was perfect.
I:15383;1128;Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier.
I:15383;1129;A real surprise for me was Hugh Jackman.
I:15383;1130;Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self.
I:15383;1131;The nature of the characters reflects human nature.
I:15383;1132;Films that project non contrast between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights.
I:15383;1133;At least this movie tried, and as far as I know, succeeds.
I:15383;1134;Everything in the movie is awesome.
I:15383;1135;it's a great movie from start to finish.
I:15383;1136;He's quite a good actor and of course you can't miss with Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman.
I:15383;1137;I just loved the way these two illusionist/magicians tried to outdo one another.
I:15383;1138;The ending surprised me though and that's the reaction a good movie should have on you!
I:15383;1139;Not going to go into intricate plot details, all I can say is that if you enjoy drama and suspense, this movie is certainly it.
I:15383;1140;I don't know anything about magic, and I found the premise of the film innovative.
I:15383;1141;You get a glimpse into the world of professional magic, and showmanship, as Bale and Jackman try for years to outdo each other's careers due to a personal vendetta.
I:15383;1142;Michael Kane is their mentor and does a great supporting role .
I:15383;1143;Like a good magic show, the film keeps the viewer constantly guessing, and slightly in the dark about what is really going on.
I:15383;1144;The film will hold your interest, especially when it takes a turn towards science fiction with the introduction of the physicist Tessla, who is asked to use science to create a new, and real, magic trick.
I:15383;1145;"The outcome of physics meeting magic is surprising, and the final ""prestige"" ."
I:15383;1146;of the film left me truly surprised.
I:15383;1147;"The romantic role of Bale's wife takes an overly melodramatic turn, but if you can overlook that flaw, and the overwhelming need for the films two characters to just ""let go"", the film rewards with a most unusual mystery."
I:15383;1148;way to the end, the excitement really picked up and I was very happy with the twisted ending.
I:15383;1149;I for one enjoyed the ending and found it justified.
I:15383;1150;Films that can entertain you AND get you thinking are very important.
I:15383;1151;If you like to piece together puzzles or play puzzle games in your head, then this film will definately delight you whilst watching it, and even after its over and you know the answers.
I:15383;1152;that will free your mind to enjoy the amazing cinematography and direction that this film recieves.
I:15383;1153;That should be a testament to the Nolan brothers' talent, who are quite intelligent and far ahead of their time.
I:15383;1154;The picture is alive and breathtaking.
I:15383;1155;i do not use the word breathtaking lightly, i mean the picture, if it could phsycially do it, WOULD jump out of the TV and punch you in the chest, knocking all wind out of you, its so delightfully vibrant.
I:15383;1156;the sound is equally amazing, and can be best experienced on a 5.1 surround system.
I:15383;1157;this flick really has more to it than any old flick you can pick up at your local blockbuster.
I:15383;1158;do enjoy THE PRESTIGE for what it has to OFFER, its a film that definately meets your expectations at the door, and invites you into its house, rather than yours.
I:15383;1159;Having said all that, i was delighted by the overall presentation of the film, and enjoyed it very much.
I:15383;1160;highly recommended with 5 stars.
I:15383;1161;"My view about any artistic endeavor is that every individual will view it from their own perspective and make their own decision about how worthy it is unless your middle initial happens to be ""W""."
I:15383;1162;Bottom line, I liked it, I was entertained and yes the hats kinda give you an idea of what is going on but that makes you feel good so all in all the film was worth seeing.
I:15383;1163;I learned something from the film too and that is always handy.
I:15383;1164;Probably one of my favorite movies ever made!
I:15383;1165;Great acting, directing, and an amazing story.
I:15383;1166;Overall, I thought this was quite a good movie and very interesting.
I:15383;1167;Of course, given the cast, the performances are excellent.
I:15383;1168;I initially thought David Bowie an odd choice for Tesla, but ultimately decided he was perfect for the part.
I:15383;1169;Hugh Jackman is always a favorite, as is Michael Caine.
I:15383;1170;"I've enjoyed Christian Bale in a few of his earlier films
I:15383;1171;Despite the disturbing parts, I thought it was extremely well done and very intriguing.
I:15383;1172;The Prestige is introduced with the basic elements of magic.
I:15383;1173;From that rivalry, a story is told that explores the depths these characters will go in order to keep the secrets that come with their profession and their obsession with learning each other's secrets in order to become the superior magician.
I:15383;1174;the film has an impressive cast, led by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as the rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.
I:15383;1175;The performances of both actors add greater depth and mystery to their characters, making them either more sympathetic or more suspicious depending on the event, the point of view or the reveal.
I:15383;1176;With two such intense characters, Cutter, played by the legendary Michael Caine, puts the need for secrets in perspective as their guide and mentor while adding another, more objective view of the rivalry between the two magicians.
I:15383;1177;handed and deliberate, it is also beautifully filmed with tones, sets and costumes that enhance the era of the story.
I:15383;1178;It's a gripping movie, filled with intense emotions that come from mystery, suspense, drama, romance and rivalry which make the journey extremely satisfying.
I:15383;1179;The good:it wasn't boring .
I:15383;1180;"i've seen the other magician movie: ""The Illusionist"" (twice) and found it magical in every sense."
I:15383;1181;It had a great ending, satisfying and a great surprise.
I:15383;1182;but i can tell you the story of this movie is brilliant, intriguing, full of twists, and it keeps your eyes locked on the screen thruout the movie.
I:15383;1183;brilliant acting by jackman and bale, but also by bowie as tesla.
I:15383;1184;costumes, jewellery, all so authentic, paired with great acting makes it almost real.
I:15383;1185;the story, as always, is universal story of humanity .
I:15383;1186;"There's no real winner here
I:15383;1187;First of all, Christian Bale, without a doubt, is one of the most drop.
I:15383;1188;dead gorgeous guys on the face of this earth who has also got charming talent for acting behind a movie camera!
I:15383;1189;Christian was so cute as a boy and really grew up into a major heartthrob!
I:15383;1190;I have seen him in Batman,Rescue Dawn and American Psycho as well as The Prestige and he is excellent in all these films.
I:15383;1191;He can always deliver an outstanding performance in whatever role he takes on.
I:15383;1192;He is totally convincing in every role, especially in The Prestige, playing a magician.
I:15383;1193;I recommend this to all Bale fans.
I:15383;1194;it's a clever movie, a deceptively simple tale, with several layers of intrigue and irony.
I:15383;1195;nolan demonstrates yet again that he is a master director, and the performances from the cast are uniformly excellent.
I:15383;1196;this movie does have a complex storyline, and it does require concentration.
I:15383;1197;But, like a fine wine, it opens up to be enjoyed!Well worth watching!
I:15383;1198;This is probably my favorite movie of all time, I've never heard anyone have anything bad to say about it.
I:15383;1199;This is a movie with a stellar cast, a good script, an intriguing premise and a lot of twists and turns.
I:15383;1200;It also features a climax in which it changes from one type of movie to another.
I:15383;1201;"genre transformation is a good thing seems to be very much a matter of personal opinion
I:15383;1202;Two illusionists are battling each other to be acclaimed as the best magicians of their time.
I:15383;1203;watch for yourself and make up your mind.
I:15383;1204;There's such a lot to like about the movie that even if you don't care for the ending you'll still have enjoyed the film, as I did.
I:15383;1205;I'm a huge Nolan fan and this was one of the films I was not able to see in theaters.
I:15383;1206;bale, Caine and Nolan always make a great team and Bale does deliver in this film.
I:15383;1207;His well played foe , Jackman, is also great.
I:15383;1208;Jackman did a brilliant job with the accents that I almost forgot he was Australian.
I:15383;1209;One does it on the sidewalk, the other does it on top of the Luxor casino.
I:15383;1210;It is still a decent film to enjoy and if you want to add it to your collection, then do so, especially if you are a Nolan fan.
I:15383;1211;What a treat it must have been for the ladies: two magicians, each trying to outdo the other, and both far too good looking and well built for their own good.
I:15383;1212;Yes, a good time to be alive.
I:15383;1213;But it made for a more realistic story, and for that, they get high marks.
I:15383;1214;in a nutshell, it is a story of one.
I:15383;1215;the plot meanders a bit, and the ending doesn't feel organic, but it still makes for excellent cinema.
I:15383;1216;Great twists and turns throughout.
I:15383;1217;Kept me guessing through the entire movie.
I:15383;1218;Don't get me wrong, that is all well and good.
I:15383;1219;This movie is a great mystery movie, and I recommend it to anybody who likes mystery movies.
I:15383;1220;The movie has good twists all the way through it, and the overall theme is great: obsession will eventually consume you.
I:15383;1221;Perhaps the best mind bending movie I have ever seen.
I:15383;1222;Like many of Christopher Nolan's movies the Prestige will you keep you interested and guessing from beginning to end.
I:15383;1223;The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both as good as any.
I:15383;1224;As I watched this movie, I noticed that the lighting always had two shades.
I:15383;1225;The reason I mention this is that the lighting also illustrates the duality of good and evil in this movie.
I:15383;1226;christopher Nolan continues to impress, and does a great job alternating between the two main characters.
I:15383;1227;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as the magicians, and Michael Caine once again delivers a finely understated role.
I:15383;1228;Well done, and certainly recommended.
I:15383;1229;Just see it and i dare you not to be entertained.
I:15383;1230;If you have read the book you are properly thinking the movie is terrible, but the movie is great.
I:15383;1231;This is one of those movies that has lots of twists and turns, and is played out really well, but not random, if you're really paying attention, you can figure out what's coming, or what the twists are.
I:15383;1232;Even so, its an entertaining watch.
I:15383;1233;One of those watch once every couple of years kind of movies.
I:15383;1234;Great picture on the blu.
I:15383;1235;The Prestige is what I might call an intelligent popcorn flick and was certainly worth the big screen experience.
I:15383;1236;The timeline, similarly to Nolan's Memento, was used to great effect to reveal the entire story at a nice pace with more impact.
I:15383;1237;On top of that, the historical implications of the science make it fun to wonder.
I:15383;1238;noir movies, a virtual remake of a 2005 biopic, and two magician movies.
I:15383;1239;"The first was ""The Illusionist"" a great looking film, with some good stars and a hypnotic lead played by Edward Norton."
I:15383;1240;It also had an actress, Jessica Biel, who isn't respected by many as an actress but ended up delivering a great performance.
I:15383;1241;The Prestige also looks great, has a talent.
I:15383;1242;laden cast, a very talented director,great set design and special effects, and an actress named Scarlett Johansson, who gives a very good performance despite being dissed every time she shows up in a movie.
I:15383;1243;The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan, the talented director behind Memento, Batman Begins, and Insomnia.
I:15383;1244;The movie stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Johansson, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie, all of whom are talented and underrated actors with the exception of Caine (who is very talented and not underrated at all).
I:15383;1245;Then one night Angier catches one of Borden's shows and sees the greatest trick he has ever seen.
I:15383;1246;Both Jackman and Bale are so great in their performances and are really fascinating to watch.
I:15383;1247;Caine, Bowie, and Serkis (as Bowie's assistant) turn in great supporting performances.
I:15383;1248;Johansson and Perabo aren't really considered fine actresses, but both are really good here.
I:15383;1249;Although if I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone criticize Johansson's English accent, I'd be a rich man.
I:15383;1250;But this is a fictional film that frequently reminds you to pay attention.
I:15383;1251;Watching the movie the 2nd time, it makes a lot more sense.
I:15383;1252;The Prestige is one of the best films of 2006 in the sense that it's one of the best.
I:15383;1253;"It's incredibly entertaining, great to look at, and is more likely to appeal to a broader audience than the typical ""best film of the year"" selection."
I:15383;1254;"The Prestige is a wonderful film that even though you take their warning and ""watch closely"" you will still want to watch it again and again."
I:15383;1255;"So many films that have a ""twist"" usually end up being a one."
I:15383;1256;With repeat viewings I get something new out of it, and of course it has wonderful acting by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine you don't want to take your eyes off of it.
I:15383;1257;"The imagery really ""pops"" in high."
I:15383;1258;You must see this film!
I:15383;1259;Intriging and a interesting movie.
I:15383;1260;The sign of a great movie is when you want to see it over again.
I:15383;1261;And this one fits the bill.
I:15383;1262;But watching it a second time only reinforces what a brilliant piece of writing and directing this is.
I:15383;1263;I have not yet read the book The Prestige was based on, so I can't give a comparison there, but I can tell you that this is a fantastic movie!
I:15383;1264;The acting was excellent, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the plot keeps you very interested.
I:15383;1265;This is certainly worth watching.
I:15383;1266;The movie is quiet a bit entertainment, the plot is curious and the performance of Hugh Jackman is far superior than Christian Bale.
I:15383;1267;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are an award winning duo.
I:15383;1268;Great acting, great story, great movie.
I:15383;1269;I always tend to dislike Scarlett Johansson in pretty much everything, but Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are so excellent that I can overlook her underly.
I:15383;1270;The acting was great, very subtle.
I:15383;1271;so subtle in fact that I had to see it a few times to understand fully what happened :)
I:15383;1272;The world of illusion is one that has entertained audiences worldwide for years and years, and now you will be taken behind the scenes to witness how some of these tricks are created, but also just how obsessive and dark this world can be.
I:15383;1273;"The man responsible for showing you this side of magic, is none other than director Christopher Nolan, who has become one of Hollywood's most successful director's in recent years, with his films ranging from the confusing, sleeper hit ""Memento"", to the detective thriller ""Insomnia"", to DC Comics' caped crusader in ""Batman Begins"", and has managed to intrigue audiences every step of the way."
I:15383;1274;There are several major twists within the story, with many minor ones thrown in along the way that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will be coming at you next.
I:15383;1275;In some movies too many surprises or twists can bring about a movies eventual downfall.
I:15383;1276;The Prestige avoids this pitfall, thanks to the excellent writing of director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan.
I:15383;1277;Together they have managed to successfully craft a thoroughly engaging revenge movie that is unique, in that there is no clear cut hero in the movie.
I:15383;1278;This exploration into the somewhat darker side of magic is so intriguing because it's a part of that world that you haven't seen before.
I:15383;1279;"The acting in this movie is truly excellent, and allows ""The Prestige"" to become another successful film for director Christopher Nolan."
I:15383;1280;by now, you have no doubt concluded that I really enjoyed this movie, and therefore highly recommend people to watch it.
I:15383;1281;acted, dramatic, and intense movie.
I:15383;1282;"going experience, then ""The Prestige"" is definitely one movie to watch, and if you're like me you'll want to see it again once it's over."
I:15383;1283;My boyfriend and I love this movie.
I:15383;1284;It keeps you guessing from the beginning, and it is a great story.
I:15383;1285;Very well done, and a great date night movie.
I:15383;1286;Another very entertaining movie from the director of Batman.
I:15383;1287;Not sure if you can call this underrated, but It truly is amazing.
I:15383;1288;My two oldest daughters watched this with my wife and myself and loved it.
I:15383;1289;It's even better the second time you watch it!
I:15383;1290;Really loved the film and loved the 50gb VC1 (aka MPEG.4) video codec transfer and Dolby Digital track was good as well.
I:15383;1291;I loved the cinematography and the acting.
I:15383;1292;Prepare yourself for a fascinating movie but you'll never be able to prepare yourself for the ending.
I:15383;1293;So many twists that you'll want to watch it a 2nd time right after you see the ending.
I:15383;1294;The movie is dark, (both the theme and the cinematography) and is pretty despresssing.
I:15383;1295;"My husband and I both enjoyed ""The Illusionist"" much more that this movie."
I:15383;1296;But over all the film was very clever and had many plot twists.
I:15383;1297;christopher Nolan is simply astonishing us with his direction and especially the screenplay.
I:15383;1298;and you should remember this dialog and watch it very closely to get a good grip on the story line.
I:15383;1299;of course another wonderful performances by Michael Caine as Mr. Cutter and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier.
I:15383;1300;This film kept both my husband and I riveted all the way through.
I:15383;1301;The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was very good.
I:15383;1302;I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.
I:15383;1303;As usual, Michael Caine was thoroughly enjoyable and Hugh Jackman's character development was inspired.
I:15383;1304;I love all of Hugh Jackman Movies he is the greatest actor.
I:15383;1305;It is just as great as other movies he has made.
I:15383;1306;I got the movie in great time, it was exactly what the seller described.
I:15383;1307;This is one of those that you wish hadn't just watched it, so you could watch it again, for the first time :)
I:15383;1308;The Prestige, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of 2006!
I:15383;1309;It has a very intricate plot line, in which it is, virtually impossible to understand by only seeing it one time.
I:15383;1310;I saw it four times in the theater and it is truly amazing.
I:15383;1311;Definitely some of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's best work thus far.
I:15383;1312;MOVIE: The Prestige is Christopher Nolan's new thriller and also the second film about magicians that we've seen in the past few months.
I:15383;1313;The Prestige tells the story of Robert (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred (Christian Bale), two friends who make their living as magicians in London.
I:15383;1314;He travels to see Nikola Tesla (played surprisingly well by David Bowie), a mysterious man who designed a machine for Alfred once.
I:15383;1315;What follows is a great and entertaining film, but it's really more about the tricks and the twists than it is about the characters.
I:15383;1316;the film is incredibly stylish and it has Christopher Nolan written all over it.
I:15383;1317;He crafts a great film and follows the structure of the magician's act.
I:15383;1318;Directed By Christopher Nolan appears on the screen and we realize who the true magician is.
I:15383;1319;The film is a wild ride with incredible atmosphere and great acting.
I:15383;1320;You truly are captivated by the setting of the film.
I:15383;1321;David Julyan's tense ambient score keeps things on the edge and Wally Pfister's dark and muted cinematography creates the perfect mood.
I:15383;1322;aCTING: As in terms of acting we get a fine slate.
I:15383;1323;Christian Bale steals the show and crafts a very deceiving character, which all the more helps the impact of the twist ending.
I:15383;1324;Bale finally gets to act with his native English accent, and it's interesting to hear him with it since we are so used to him speaking with an American accent.
I:15383;1325;Hugh Jackman does a superb job at matching Bale's screen presence.
I:15383;1326;The acting is great all around, and it always is when it's a Nolan film.
I:15383;1327;bOTTOM LINE: Nolan delivers a crafty and suspenseful film.
I:15383;1328;It's visually stunning with great cinematography and set design.
I:15383;1329;It's a great movie though that promises to entertain.
I:15383;1330;This movie is well worth watching, not just for fans of magic but for anyone who likes a good, character driven plot line.
I:15383;1331;This movie deserves full concentration and I found it a bit exhausting at times (but worthwhile).
I:15383;1332;Both Huge Jackman and Christian Bale are in top form, playing rival magicians, each with a special talents.
I:15383;1333;Add to that some romance, jealousy, a former friendship between the two magicians and Michael Caine as a superb wise man and observer of the whole situation and you have an excellent film.
I:15383;1334;even so, this movie is superior to so much that is out there and the actors do a superb job in delineating the dangers of obsession .
I:15383;1335;A Surprising, intriguing story that will keep you thinking throughout the movie.
I:15383;1336;This is a fantastic movie, cheaper price than what I saw in the store.
I:15383;1337;Many other reviews discussed the many merits of this film and I agree.
I:15383;1338;It is one of my favorites!
I:15383;1339;"fi, ""The Wild, Wild, West""), or love the edgier episodes of ""The Twilight Zone,"" then you will love the movie."
I:15383;1340;What we see is one odd lump of humanity.
I:15383;1341;It is the most important product of his creative brain.
I:15383;1342;Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs.
I:15383;1343;But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.
I:15383;1344;I have read several of the reviews of this film, and I have trouble seeing how anyone can give this masterpiece less than 4 stars.
I:15383;1345;It is really a great piece of work.
I:15383;1346;hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both put on top notch performances as obsessed and highly talented magicians.
I:15383;1347;Michael Cane is superb as the magical.
I:15383;1348;The rest of the cast is perfectly placed, and wonderfully directed.
I:15383;1349;Perhaps one of the most complex plots I have encountered in a while, and this was refreshing.
I:15383;1350;Seeing a good story that requires that you pay close attention to make sure you do not miss some subtle element made this film even more engaging that it already is.
I:15383;1351;Niether of the protagonist magicians is really all that likable.
I:15383;1352;factly' to be a true shocker.
I:15383;1353;But that point asside, all of the other smaller reveals that are taking place at the same time are enough to keep you at the edge of your seat though it all.
I:15383;1354;want to see it again.
I:15383;1355;I will watch it a few more times, I am sure, before I move on to another film.
I:15383;1356;this is a great movie.
I:15383;1357;so much so that i want to show it to a friend.
I:15383;1358;i bought it just so that she could see it.
I:15383;1359;i found that i already owned the movie.
I:15383;1360;This is one of my favorite movies, It is very suspenseful where Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman keep you on the edge of your seat and very confused.
I:15383;1361;I happen to think this was a great film.
I:15383;1362;the story was strong and convincing as well as the acting.
I:15383;1363;The sets and costumes were fantastic.
I:15383;1364;All the players are in fine form here.
I:15383;1365;Each one fleshes out their character quite well and play into the common theme dynamically.
I:15383;1366;if you like a good mystery that is tense and driven, then this is the film for you.
I:15383;1367;A rare trip as of late as most mysteries have to be gore or flesh driven.
I:15383;1368;All Hitchcock and DePalma fans will love this one.
I:15383;1369;It's a good movie with a lot of stars, a very good script and an rare end.
I:15383;1370;"Like many other reviewers, I came into Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" with high expectations."
I:15383;1371;He, thus far, has a pretty good track record in my book.
I:15383;1372;Batman Begins ranks highly among adult comic book movies, but prior to that.
I:15383;1373;"And ""The Prestige,"" while not a perfect film, certainly provides its leads with robust roles and delivers much to admire."
I:15383;1374;i found it refreshingly mean spirited and believable.
I:15383;1375;Jackman and Bale both give great, passionate performances.
I:15383;1376;Caine is terrific, as always, and Scarlett Johansson is perfect as a woman caught between the feuding warriors.
I:15383;1377;I figured out one of the primary surprises early on.
I:15383;1378;The film is built in a multilayered flashback structure that is interesting and rewarding.
I:15383;1379;It adds to the dramatic revelations of the final act.
I:15383;1380;But there is a science fiction element that is dropped in at the last moment.
I:15383;1381;And while I know that the film is actually based on a sci.
I:15383;1382;After so much real emotion, such a fantastic setup, so much believability.
I:15383;1383;this plot twist quickly brings what was a great film back to earth as a good one.
I:15383;1384;The Prestige is a satisfying and adult treat.
I:15383;1385;It boasts some of the best performances of the year, and is beautiful and fascinating to look at.
I:15383;1386;On second viewing, this is a good movie when viewed as the duality of good and evil in everyone, and how our motivations of our actions are more important than the actions themselves.
I:15383;1387;i loved the underhanded sci fi nature of this movie.
I:15383;1388;always happy to rewatch it
I:15383;1389;The Prestige, has a series of clever twists, and is definitely geared towards an audience that thinks about what they're watching.
I:15383;1390;The cinematography is wonderful and Scarlet Johansson really shines as a somewhat devious vixen.
I:15383;1391;If you like magic and plot twists than I recommend it.
I:15383;1392;I went into the movie theater to see 'The Prestige' with high expectations.
I:15383;1393;"The old saying ""Watch closely"" is perfectly fitting for this movie."
I:15383;1394;I was completely surprised by the ending, and it kept me on my toes the entire time.
I:15383;1395;Hugh Jackman was excellent as usual, and Christian Bale was wonderful as well.
I:15383;1396;The wisdom his character brought to the story was essential.
I:15383;1397;You have got to see this movie, what else can I say?!
I:15383;1398;Is it fascinating, unsettling and dark?
I:15383;1399;Those qualities don't by themselves equal a good movie, but Chris Nolan has done a splendid job of taking an excellent, but cinematically challenging novel and molding it into a fine film.
I:15383;1400;"winning book ""The Prestige,"" and you'll appreciate just how many original concepts and new writing went into the film script."
I:15383;1401;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both perfectly cast.
I:15383;1402;"And David Bowie does a super job of bringing the brilliant Nikola Tesla, the ""father of electricity"" to life."
I:15383;1403;One of Nolan's finest movies in my opinion.
I:15383;1404;Very nice treatment of the world of magic and men with big egos.
I:15383;1405;Pay close attention, as with all of Nolan's movies, there are important clues in the small details.
I:15383;1406;"The actors do their job (Caine and Johansson are the best
I:15383;1407;The two performers are in competition with each other to become the most renowned magician of their time.
I:15383;1408;the actors performances are wonderful and totally convincing.
I:15383;1409;this film has more plot twists than a mountain road.
I:15383;1410;It is such a good film that you will enjoy watching it a second time.
I:15383;1411;"the ""dark"" soundtrack adds so much to the intrigue of this movie."
I:15383;1412;highly recommended for a great evening of fun.
I:15383;1413;I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and it was so good that I pre.
I:15383;1414;It's one of those movies that literally TELLS you what all the twists are through strategically placed clues and hints, but they still have a way of surprising you with at least ONE of the twists.
I:15383;1415;the characters are PERFECTLY developed (much more than the book), and the actors are of course amazing.
I:15383;1416;It's best if you watch it twice, though, because then you're more likely to catch all the clues and hints that you missed the first time around, and you gain MORE of an appreciation of how much expertise and detailed planning was put into such an amazing film.
I:15383;1417;This year brought us two magic movies and both were good in their own way.
I:15383;1418;Only one of them was truly great, though.
I:15383;1419;"I enjoyed ""The Illusionist"" thoroughly."
I:15383;1420;Which makes his achievement here all the more impressive.
I:15383;1421;he has crafted a movie with real magic in it that seems to have an endless amount of thought put into it.
I:15383;1422;This movie gets better and better and better every time you see it.
I:15383;1423;off attitude is what's key to this movie's success.
I:15383;1424;It feels so fresh and alive partly because the performances seem off the cuff and spontaneous.
I:15383;1425;"Like maybe the director got together with some buddies and said, ""Let's have some fun with this""."
I:15383;1426;And much of the fun in this movie revolves around messing with your head.
I:15383;1427;The opening shot is really fantastic as it sets the dark mood and gives you an important clue in unlocking the film's secrets.
I:15383;1428;"Of particular note as well is the fine work of the two lead actors, particularly Hugh Jackman, who has displayed an incredible range this year with both his dual role here (don't ask) and his career best work in ""The Fountain""."
I:15383;1429;"These two incredibly talented guys spar with each other in a far more satisfying way than Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti do in ""The Illusionist""."
I:15383;1430;Here you feel a real danger and ferocity that hits you right in the gut.
I:15383;1431;Kudos also to David Bowie for being awesome in just about everything I've seen him do with acting.
I:15383;1432;He makes Nicola Tesla, a real man, this iconic, almost Godlike figure of mystery and genius.
I:15383;1433;This movie stands on its own as one of the best movies I've seen this year.
I:15383;1434;With Nicolas Tesla played by David Bowie, and the mix of real magic and mystery, this is a taut psychological drama, an intimate picture of the magic's burdens.
I:15383;1435;This is one of the year's best!
I:15383;1436;"Nolan has also done ""Batman Begins"" (2005), which he co. wrote the screenplay and directed, which in fact is the prequel to ""The Dark Knight"", he has also done the American remake of ""Insomnia"" (2002), and the impressive psychological thriller ""Memento"" (2000), which he, again, also co. wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan and both were nominated for an Oscar for their screenplay and he also wrote and directed his debut film ""Following"" (1998) is excellent!"
I:15383;1437;Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation!
I:15383;1438;"The music by David Julyan (who also did the music to Nolan's ""Following"", ""Memento"", and ""Insomnia"", he also did the music to ""The Descent"" (2006) is excellent!"
I:15383;1439;"The cinematography by Wally Pfister (who also nominated for an Oscar for his work on Nolan's ""Batman Begins"", he also done Nolan's ""Memento"", ""Insomnia"" and the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"") is excellent!"
I:15383;1440;"The film editing by Lee Smith (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" (2003), he has done Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" and the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"") is excellent!"
I:15383;1441;"The casting by John Papsidera (who also done the casting to Nolan's ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"", he has also done the casting to ""Final Destination 3"" (2006) is excellent!"
I:15383;1442;"The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also done the production design to Nolan's ""Insomnia"", ""Batman Begins"", and the upcoming ""The Dark Knight"", he has also done the production design to ""The Lake House"" (2006) is excellent!"
I:15383;1443;"The art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (who also did the art direction to ""The Lake House"") is excellent!"
I:15383;1444;"The set decoration by Julie Ochipinti (who was also an assistant art director on Nolan's ""Batman Begins"") is excellent!"
I:15383;1445;The costume design by Joan Bergin is excellent!
I:15383;1446;This is another one of Nolan's films that has put him in the place of master filmmakers.
I:15383;1447;This is a visually, brilliant looking movie and it is also an impressive, smart, and excellent film that makes you think and keeps you guessing and makes you want more answers and questions.
I:15383;1448;This movie is action packed with intensity and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
I:15383;1449;What I love about this movie (perfect or not) is what I love about all of Christopher Nolan's movies .
I:15383;1450;the mesmerizing sense of obsession.
I:15383;1451;aside from having a marvelous cast and an intricate plot .
I:15383;1452;If you're cerebral at all you'll enjoy picking it apart.
I:15383;1453;Very nice plot, although i doubt with seeing it one time that everything is completely clear.
I:15383;1454;looks good, full of solid acting, interesting story, but it gets a little convoluted, and the plot becomes somewhat oblique.
I:15383;1455;caine has been ubiquitous for so many years now, but you've gotta hand it to him, he's still pretty good.
I:15383;1456;worth watching if you like period pieces/mysteries.
I:15383;1457;this one was not frightening and the plot twists were entertaining.
I:15383;1458;This movie is Chris Nolan doing what Chris Nolan does best, providing you with a brilliant mind f***.
I:15383;1459;You will seriously be on the edge of your seat almost the entire movie.
I:15383;1460;If you like Chris Nolan's other works, Inception, Memento etc you NEED this film!
I:15383;1461;if you want to see a decent movie that has a magician theme to it, check out The Illusionist.
I:15383;1462;The action, suspense, mystery, drama.
I:15383;1463;Christopher Nolan is becoming one of the best directors out there.
I:15383;1464;Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine all are great.
I:15383;1465;I love the accent on Bale's character.
I:15383;1466;I really felt I knew these characters.
I:15383;1467;That is a huge credit to Nolan and the actors.
I:15383;1468;I actually think Jackman is a great actor now and not just a great action actor.
I:15383;1469;He gives a helluva performance.
I:15383;1470;Just go see this movie.
I:15383;1471;Really enjoyable movie, decent storyline, great visuals and an all star cast really made this movie shine and do well.
I:15383;1472;I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and it still seems that every time I watch it I pick up on something new.
I:15383;1473;I've recommended this movie to all my friends and haven't heard one complaint.
I:15383;1474;A movie about magicians, that should be interesting.
I:15383;1475;I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was.
I:15383;1476;I actually had to watch this movie at least 3 times, and each time, I discovered something new.
I:15383;1477;"Robert is known as ""The Great Danton"", and he obviously has more showmanship than fellow magician."
I:15383;1478;The cast is amazing, Michael Caine is a delight to see as always.
I:15383;1479;Ultimately, they both deserved each other, and they both deserved what they got.
I:15383;1480;So, it is reversed, but if you pay close attention you'll see that hindsight is 20/20 vision, so they are giving you clues to the ending the entire movie hence the line.
I:15383;1481;David is always a sight to see, and he does play the great Nikola Tesla quite classy and elegant.
I:15383;1482;Pay close attention to the dialogue and especially the characters.
I:15383;1483;Bale and Jackman do a fine job.
I:15383;1484;First of all I admire Scarlett Jhohanson and her work.
I:15383;1485;She is amazing in every role she has played.
I:15383;1486;I beleive she is very naturally talented no matter what school she graduated from.
I:15383;1487;She just has the charisma.
I:15383;1488;This is not the strongest role ever but she is very good as always in this particular movie.
I:15383;1489;the movie's subject now is very interesting and it twists in many ways to the point that you cannot really comprehend exactly what happened uless you watched it twice.
I:15383;1490;It 's a smart comlecated thriller.
I:15383;1491;I liked this move with all it's twists and turns, right up until the very end where the Prestige was revealed, then I didn't like it so much.
I:15383;1492;o performance from David Bowie as Nichola Tesla.
I:15383;1493;But this movie, I can't even adequetly describe it, is amazing.
I:15383;1494;Good for teens and adults.
I:15383;1495;kudos to Hugh Jackman for a great performance!
I:15383;1496;Everyone I have loaned it to has liked it.
I:15383;1497;Both stars played excitement roles.
I:15383;1498;This movie definitely keeps you interested.
I:15383;1499;Hugh Jackman and Christain Bale both did a wonderful job.
I:15383;1500;Very good movie, one that will keep you entertained.
I:15383;1501;A great rivalry movie, with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.
I:15383;1502;Totally recommend for those who enjoy Magic Movies.
I:15383;1503;One is good at thinking up tricks.
I:15383;1504;One is good at the showmanship.
I:15383;1505;The other man is sexy, handsome and has elan of a master showman, but doesn't have the know it all to make up tricks, so he works with Michael Cane's character.
I:15383;1506;You will really want to watch this movie again!
I:15383;1507;I love twisted deep stories.
I:15383;1508;Have loved this movie since it was released!
I:15383;1509;I am in love with anything magic or anything to do with it!
I:15383;1510;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale and Michael Caine are wonderful in this great movie.
I:15383;1511;A great story that keeps you intrigued throughout and there is even a twist at the end.
I:15383;1512;The audience is left to draw their conclusion.
I:15383;1513;See how good this works?
I:15383;1514;This was probably the best movie I've seen all year.
I:15383;1515;Mysterious, dark, and more than a little quirky, the story is riveting and ends on a surprisingly sympathetic note.
I:15383;1516;I won't give anything away here but it is a great movie.
I:15383;1517;the cast and characterizations are flawless.
I:15383;1518;As a huge Christian Bale fan, I always think each movie I see him in is his best work yet.
I:15383;1519;It is very entertaining and thought provoking, especially if you are intrigued by magic and illusions!
I:15383;1520;This is one of those movies that you really need to watch more than once to appreciate the subtle characters points and plot twists.
I:15383;1521;The performances and direction are top notch.
I:15383;1522;A very pleasant surprise, The Prestige, brings to the screen the destructive enmity between two rival magicians who will go to great lengths to settle an old score.
I:15383;1523;hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:15383;1524;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!
I:15383;1525;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.
I:15383;1526;While there are interesting elements in the film version of The Prestige, the novel is a brilliant tour de force whose legerdemain is found in its ability to, as magicians themselves do, provide just enough information.
I:15383;1527;And in fact, the novel has a glorious depth missing in the film.
I:15383;1528;the primary elements are retained from the novel.
I:15383;1529;But the novel is a devilishly clever work in which the reader is wrapped up in the intricately plotted machinations of each magician against the other.
I:15383;1530;there's no question that the film is entertaining.
I:15383;1531;who will top who, and how it will be done.
I:15383;1532;a combination of their looks and acting ability that would, as do all good magicians, put on a great show.
I:15383;1533;The entirety of Angier's diary is described in detail in the novel, but the film gives us only bits and pieces.
I:15383;1534;It is truly a masterpiece.
I:15383;1535;I love shopping using Amazon!!
I:15383;1536;He did a good job, as did the others
I:15383;1537;Take two rival magicians, then make their rivalry intensely personal.
I:15383;1538;Jackman, Bale, and Bowie each did outstanding jobs playing cold, dark characters that are passionate but somehow reptilian, with Michael Caine providing some rational relief.
I:15383;1539;This was a good movie, not great.
I:15383;1540;The acting was excellent and the magic effects interesting.
I:15383;1541;Great acting all around and a good plot kept this movie going forward.
I:15383;1542;The movie deals with betrayal, revenge, love and obsession.
I:15383;1543;It's a beautifully made film with great use of metaphor.
I:15383;1544;"It is amazing to me that director Christopher Nolan, fresh from directing stars Christian Bale and Michael Caine in the incredible movie ""Batman Begins,"" is able to turn the quest for a magic trick into a two."
I:15383;1545;Even more amazing is that even in the slow spots this movie pulls you into the complexity of the relationship between two rival magicians.
I:15383;1546;Each magician routinely finds ways to steal the other's tricks.
I:15383;1547;Borden's ultimate trick, the Transporting Man, is particularly clever and makes Borden a lasting success.
I:15383;1548;Angier believes that Tesla has the technology it takes to make the Transporting Man work, for real.
I:15383;1549;angier's return to London is phenomenally successful, sparking the rivalry with Borden anew.
I:15383;1550;"stop special effects and action, ""The Prestige"" makes effective use of lighting and sets to give this movie a moody Victorian feel."
I:15383;1551;The Prestige is a nicely directed and produced movie that combines proven movie.
I:15383;1552;making techniques with modern special effects.
I:15383;1553;The result is a unique movie that will appeal to viewers that appreciate story and characters over action and special effects.
I:15383;1554;The final science fiction twist provides a disturbing chill even to those who had a suspicion as to how the movie ends.
I:15383;1555;I really liked this movie.
I:15383;1556;It keeps you watching throughout the whole movie.
I:15383;1557;It's older but if you haven't seen it yet its worth the watch.
I:15383;1558;Although duplicate people is impossible at that time, the movie still entertain my friends and family.
I:15383;1559;It's really a nice movie.
I:15383;1560;It keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.
I:15383;1561;Interesting view on the competition between magicians.
I:15383;1562;the ending is just not expected or satisfying.
I:15383;1563;Overall the movie is interesting, sometimes thrilling and exciting, and worth the watch.
I:15383;1564;Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine and David Bowie also star in this movie about the dark.
I:15383;1565;jackman is convincing, and Chris Bale can't seem to offer a lousy performance in anything .
I:15383;1566;a truly interesting guy to watch in any genre.
I:15383;1567;"Nolan remains a captivating filmmaker to watch, but it's hard to outdo ""Memento""."
I:15383;1568;It was an intriguing movie.
I:15383;1569;Both movies are fantastic, but this one is better as it is much more dramatic and the story is more complex.
I:15383;1570;The Illusionist was much more intriguing and memorable.
I:15383;1571;Excellent period piece, costumes, scenery and set.
I:15383;1572;Pay close attention while watching, lots of twist and turns and excitement.
I:15383;1573;A rare case of a movie improving on an already good book.
I:15383;1574;The Nolan brothers' unique take on Christopher Guest's premise was just what it needed to really blossom.
I:15383;1575;In their hands the story unfolds with a thematic logic reminiscent of a classical composition.
I:15383;1576;after a first viewing we decided to watch it again with English subtitles turned on, and I would highly recommend watching it this way.
I:15383;1577;A third viewing revealed even more of the subtle, nice touches that forward and support the main premise.
I:15383;1578;this is one of my top 5 movies of the year.
I:15383;1579;The best thing that you can say about any movie is that after you finish watching it the first time you immediately want to see it again.
I:15383;1580;"Ironically the first thought that popped in my head was ""Wow ."
I:15383;1581;that was the best film I've seen since.
I:15383;1582;just as withMemento, it has intelligent use of the timeline.
I:15383;1583;and just as withInception, this film is the intelligent, well.
I:15383;1584;directed brain candy that Christopher Nolan does best.
I:15383;1585;Although recommended by a magician friend, you don't need any knowledge about magic, and the performances of Michael , David Bowie and the two leads more than outdo any magical pretensions.
I:15383;1586;so if you want to see another Christopher Nolan film that really rewards the viewer, there are few better films than this one.
I:15383;1587;alternatively, if you've never heard of him, then know that this is a film that, for a change, gets the plot and dialogue right, bringing home to you the magic of the movies.
I:15383;1588;competitive rivalry, love, and action.
I:15383;1589;Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson are great also.
I:15383;1590;For a movie about murder, revenge, and obsession, The Prestige is remarkably passionless.
I:15383;1591;The story line is sufficiently interesting, if improbable and ultimately unsatisfying, to be a pleasant enough diversion.
I:15383;1592;Despite being given so little to work with, Jackman and Bale draw you in with charisma alone, and it's nice to see Michael Caine.
I:15383;1593;now, for those of you who actually have an imagination and enjoy seeing the impossible become possible: The Prestige was probably the best picture of 2006, despite what Oscar thought.
I:15383;1594;This is an excellent movie about magic, both real and staged, revenge, science, love, and best of all, has an unsettling twist at the end.
I:15383;1595;What a way to wrap up such a fantastic film!
I:15383;1596;hour films try to do: it keeps you entertained!
I:15383;1597;This movie not only provides glimpses of the Edison/Tesla rivalry, but it gives several winks at Schrodinger's cat.
I:15383;1598;Must watch film for physicists, I believe.
I:15383;1599;This is a movie that leaves you thinking about what really happened.
I:15383;1600;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both excellent.
I:15383;1601;love the movie watch it as often as I can this is a great movie to have very intriguing love it
I:15383;1602;What a movie, all the actors were great, and it was believableThanks for getting this movie to me on time, and as advertised.
I:15383;1603;My family really enjoyed it.
I:15383;1604;That's how Robert knows when Alfred premiers his most phenomenal trick, the transported man.
I:15383;1605;It is more a character study of the two men than anything else.
I:15383;1606;The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, yet once I got the characters established in my mind, it was very easy to follow.
I:15383;1607;But the story is so engrossing.
I:15383;1608;the acting from every single member of the cast is great.
I:15383;1609;I can't single anyone out, that's how good it is.
I:15383;1610;and this is definitely a movie to own.
I:15383;1611;i am sorry I am just now watching this excellent film.
I:15383;1612;This film was very well done!
I:15383;1613;The story line captures the viewer for the entire length of the film.
I:15383;1614;The movie was very entertaining .
I:15383;1615;This is the kind of movie you will need to watch at least twice to take it all in.
I:15383;1616;It is the perfect kind of movie to own.
I:15383;1617;rate cast and a lurid magic.
I:15383;1618;There are plot twists aplenty.
I:15383;1619;"At least one of the major ""secrets"" of this film lumbers along in front of your eyes for half the film, and when it is revealed I didn't get that sense of being deliciously tricked that I got from Sixth Sense.)"
I:15383;1620;It was a good plot device .
I:15383;1621;rivals who escalate their professional rivalry into a deadly game of one.
I:15383;1622;Michael Caine's character builds the elaborate magical devices used onstage.
I:15383;1623;He serves as both supporting character and a one.
I:15383;1624;the lovely female assistant to the older plodding magician.
I:15383;1625;Tesla is played by David Bowie in a surprisingly effective performance.
I:15383;1626;The Colorado sequences are effective with the snow.
I:15383;1627;I am very happy that I was this movie because of the plot and all of the twists.
I:15383;1628;I will say that I do love this era and time period.
I:15383;1629;The competition of the magicians are what really makes this movie and the illusions that are presented.
I:15383;1630;"It did take a ""dramatic"" turn near the end and it is the ending that you do not expect."
I:15383;1631;I think that they are both excellent actors and in this one did an excellent job.
I:15383;1632;"This is a must see for anyone that likes ""movies with twists""."
I:15383;1633;If you like beautifully shot, well acted films with plot lines and twists that have more holes that one of those huge wheels of swiss cheese you find at the cheese maker, this film is for you.
I:15383;1634;The most impressive slight of hand here is that viewers thought this was a great story.
I:15383;1635;Watch it and think about it for a few minutes.
I:15383;1636;and that brings us to the identical twin that made the original transported man trick possible.
I:15383;1637;again, well acted, beautiful imagery and costumes, it's well directed, and the story COULD have been good except the screen play writers didn't really think through the scenarios.
I:15383;1638;this is a great movie picture wise, set.
I:15383;1639;The audience knows the truth: the world is simple.
I:15383;1640;if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you got to see something really special.
I:15383;1641;the world has always been captivated by magic.
I:15383;1642;The world has also been captivated by Hollywood.
I:15383;1643;Combine these and you have a FANTASTIC movie, probably the best of 2006.
I:15383;1644;The end of The Prestige makes perfect sense.
I:15383;1645;Enjoy it for what it is.
I:15383;1646;And he's the biggest critic of all.
I:15383;1647;My mother, skeptical at first, actually watched it, and she rarely likes watching movies (especially of this genre) and she seemed to enjoy it.
I:15383;1648;But after I saw The Prestige once, I immediately bought it.
I:15383;1649;You will enjoy watching it with people over and over.
I:15383;1650;I even know that was off the beaten path and that most people didn't understand him but that among other things, namely that he was a genius, makes him cool.
I:15383;1651;now, this is the kind of movie that is for the thinking audience, I saw the Illusionist and let me say its a good film, a fairy tale, but a good movie nonetheless, Paul G. is awesome in it.
I:15383;1652;But its for the not so thinking audience, its something soft and sweet to make you feel all warm and fuzzy.
I:15383;1653;I mean the comment about revenge was kind of special.
I:15383;1654;"i agree with one comment I read about ""Le Comte du Monte Cristo"" that was very true its one of those books that everyone knows, although I have yet to see someone film a version with the real ending from the book in it."
I:15383;1655;this movie is amazing, and even though I knew the heart of the trick, I still found it interesting to watch it unfold.
I:15383;1656;Its on my top one hundred movies ever.
I:15383;1657;It gets a life of its own.
I:15383;1658;One of them has to win.
I:15383;1659;The story behind this movie is compelling and gripping!!
I:15383;1660;It was beautifully told and the cinematography was awesome.
I:15383;1661;It is definitely one I would see again and again.
I:15383;1662;Enjoyed the mix of actors and the storyline was top notch.
I:15383;1663;Will recommend to anyone looking for a good movie!
I:15383;1664;I really liked the movie.
I:15383;1665;The ending was pretty neat as well.
I:15383;1666;this movie kept you guessing.
I:15383;1667;The acting was brilliant, the atmosphere drew me in.
I:15383;1668;Deception and illusion, mixed with some fantastical transportation theory really held my attention.
I:15383;1669;Certainly worth watching at least once.
I:15383;1670;Go enjoy some of the other movies.
I:15383;1671;I was really excited about this movie.
I:15383;1672;It has an excellent cast and a directer known for dark, twist.
I:15383;1673;the acting was good, but nobody's best work.
I:15383;1674;Christopher Nolan, who brought us the Dark Knight re.
I:15383;1675;"boot of Batman, as well as the cerebral ""Inception"" in recent years wrote/produced/directed this brilliant film about two magicians and the deadly consequences of their professional and personal rivalries."
I:15383;1676;The cast is flawless, well.
I:15383;1677;paced, and the use of flashbacks very effectively ties together a complex story that resolves itself in a most satisfying ending that will no doubt surprise the first.
I:15383;1678;Good cast and excellent acting.
I:15383;1679;Good story that keeps your attention with all the suspense.
I:15383;1680;This is a movie that you will watch more than once.
I:15383;1681;The Prestige, based on a novel by Christopher Priest, is a movie that surprised me.
I:15383;1682;this film, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a drama set in late 19th century London that has some ingredients that can only be described as fantasy.
I:15383;1683;the title of this movie has to do with one of the three acts of which every outstanding magic trick consists.
I:15383;1684;"The first act is ""The Pledge"", when the magician shows you something seemingly ordinary."
I:15383;1685;"The second act is ""The Turn"", when the thing that seemed ordinary is turned into something extraordinary."
I:15383;1686;"The last act is ""The Prestige"", the act that crowns the magic trick and makes it unique."
I:15383;1687;The quest of each one of them is to best the other, no matter the cost, notwithstanding the means.
I:15383;1688;"Who is the best magician, who can really achieve ""The Prestige""?"
I:15383;1689;And will he live to boast about it?On the whole, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and that I would gladly watch it a third time.
I:15383;1690;It had a unique setting, a wonderful protagonist in Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, who never disappoints, and a riveting, uncluttered story.
I:15383;1691;I found myself checking my watch every 15 minutes.
I:15383;1692;But, the difference was in the telling and the heart.
I:15383;1693;edward Norton's lovely voice was one of the saving graces of Kingdom of Heaven.
I:15383;1694;It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists and turns throughout the duration.
I:15383;1695;It was right there I should have done.
I:15383;1696;the Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie!
I:15383;1697;A big hand for all those who could.
I:15383;1698;I love Christian and Hugh .
I:15383;1699;It was a pretty suspencefull movie and having some big actors helped a lot.
I:15383;1700;the movie was Great Christopher Nolan did a great job once again i recommend seeing it, it keep you guessing till the end of the movie
I:15383;1701;If you haven't seen this movie its a must !
I:15383;1702;If you like movies that are thoughtful, twisty and keep you thinking after the last credit rolls, then this is the movie for you.
I:15383;1703;up performance in this movie and I highly recommend it!
I:15383;1704;I saw Edward Norton's The Illusionist first and really enjoyed it, though it too had a bit of a meandering problem due to the nature of the conflict.
I:15383;1705;I simply wanted more and bigger magic.
I:15383;1706;Priest is a horror/SF novelist and comic book writer.
I:15383;1707;He turned in one of the most impressive comic book runs ever when he was writing Black Panther.
I:15383;1708;the sets and the period piece work were all extremely well done.
I:15383;1709;ray and the scenes were gorgeous.
I:15383;1710;def format is absolutely the way to go for the discriminating home theater connoisseur.
I:15383;1711;the Prestige is a good movie.
I:15383;1712;People who haven't seen anything like it will love it.
I:15383;1713;Anyone who loves Christopher Nolan's films (Memento, Batman Begins) will enjoy this one.
I:15383;1714;Definitely a good film to watch with a group that likes to puzzle things out as they watch a film in the privacy of their own home so they won't disturb other paying viewers who don't like ruminations while watching.
I:15383;1715;I absolutely love this movie!
I:15383;1716;Purchasing it the movie was simple, and it arrived shortly after in the mail.
I:15383;1717;I watch it all the time!
I:15383;1718;The actors, the plot, the cool science/magic mix.
I:15383;1719;The story even brings in Houdini's water closet escape trick as well as the great scientist Tesla.
I:15383;1720;the acting is first class and Michael Caine puts in another great supporting spot.
I:15383;1721;it was an entertaining movie, however, with a few surprises throughout.
I:15383;1722;michael caine was good, as usual.
I:15383;1723;It had Nolan's name on it, and that's all I needed.
I:15383;1724;The Prestige works more as a drama/thriller/mystery.
I:15383;1725;Nolan's great at playing head.
I:15383;1726;games with you, and it's nice to see him dive intos that area of film again.
I:15383;1727;The look and feel of the film is very dark, but it looks so gorgeous.
I:15383;1728;the performances from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are perfect.
I:15383;1729;The Prestige is a total success, and then some.
I:15383;1730;"It's one of those movies that you have to watch more than once, and each time you see it (just like with ""Memento""), chances are you're going to pick up on something that you didn't see the first time around."
I:15383;1731;It ranks up there as one of my top favorites of 2006.
I:15383;1732;Nice to see that Christopher Nolan has made another fantastic movie and has proven that he's not just a one.
I:15383;1733;The movie may have a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested, but they never take away from the great story and characters.
I:15383;1734;A wonderful and well acted movie.
I:15383;1735;First time seeing it you'll never imagine where or how it'll end.
I:15383;1736;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both great in it
I:15383;1737;Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a polished American magician who performs with his wife, fellow British magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and gizmo inventor Cutter (Michael Caine).
I:15383;1738;consumes Angier and sets the tone for the movie.
I:15383;1739;But this is esteemed director Christopher Nolan we're talking about, so nothing is that simple.
I:15383;1740;The movie has multiple layers.
I:15383;1741;punch ending is worth the wait.
I:15383;1742;Wonderful characters, phenomenal photographic values, amazing magic performances, but a story that is soiled by a bizzare mix of revenge and pride.
I:15383;1743;Great movie, have watched many times over.
I:15383;1744;Received it in a timely manner.
I:15383;1745;The twist, the love, the hate, the brilliance, the emotional drama, the suffering, the sacrifice.
I:15383;1746;It is an okay movie with great actors.
I:15383;1747;There's a lot that can be said about the movie, but I'll leave that to most critics who absolutely loved this masterpiece crafted by the hands of one of the best directors of our time, Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;1748;ray version is crisp, has great sound, and is pretty much the definitive version to own.
I:15383;1749;It'll keep you guessing till the end.
I:15383;1750;It has something for everyone including a feel good ending at which point you realize who the true antagonist is.
I:15383;1751;Christopher Nolan returns with The Prestige, a movie about revenge and the obsessive minds of two rival magicians.
I:15383;1752;And what a magical experience this was.
I:15383;1753;Following the tragedy, Borden's personal life and career flourish.
I:15383;1754;this movie has everything: excitement, thrills, twist and turns, romance, surprises.
I:15383;1755;Bit by bit, everything comes into focus.
I:15383;1756;But to get there, you'll have to earn it.
I:15383;1757;you'll fall in love with it.
I:15383;1758;This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, a lot of magic and suspense, Hugh and Christian great performance.
I:15383;1759;The Prestige is a psychological thriller set circa 1900 in the world of master magicians who compete to create the most astonishing illusions using the latest technologies that will amaze and captivate audiences.
I:15383;1760;Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a masterful showman who has left a privileged upbringing behind to pursue a career in magic.
I:15383;1761;Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a brilliant, daring magician from humble beginnings who will sacrifice anything to be truly great at his craft.
I:15383;1762;The great illusion that brings the story to its startling conclusion also defies logic.
I:15383;1763;"But ""The Prestige"" is a very effective ."
I:15383;1764;Christian Bale's performance is especially intriguing.
I:15383;1765;The depth of Borden and Angier's obsession with their secrets and with each other is compelling.
I:15383;1766;Though imperfect, these two magic movies are among the most entertaining and provocative in my recent memory.
I:15383;1767;The Prestige is a gripping psychological thriller.
I:15383;1768;The Illusionist is historically inspired and visually and aurally entrancing.
I:15383;1769;part featurette that includes interviews with director Christopher Nolan, the cast, novelist Christopher Priest, and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan about Victorian era magicians, the film's visual style, themes, and Nicola Tesla.
I:15383;1770;Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French.
I:15383;1771;And only one magician can be the best.
I:15383;1772;Jackman is the polished, eloquent, well.
I:15383;1773;accented one who is unswervingly committed to the craft.
I:15383;1774;bale plays his complicated role with convincing shades.
I:15383;1775;Jackman is superb, sometimes pitiable, sometimes repulsive.
I:15383;1776;A good man who loves his career, but who is stuck between the competitive madness.
I:15383;1777;while both leads are immensely watchable, Caine and Johansson are terrific in supporting roles.
I:15383;1778;the prestige, that part of the act where the audience is befuddled and amazed and the magician gets his glorious due, the moment of wonder and the unsolved trick.
I:15383;1779;tells us we should watch, watch carefully, because the movie is about to pull a heckuva rabbit out of the hat.
I:15383;1780;unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, last year's other feature film with a magician as the man character, this one does have surprises, things up its sleeve, that you realize bit by bit.
I:15383;1781;And that's a lot of fun.
I:15383;1782;Because even when you congratulate yourself for figuring X or Y out early, you still have a ways to go until.
I:15383;1783;hand film with two dazzling male leads who keep you guessing.
I:15383;1784;"Proof positive that director Christopher Nolan, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are among the finest, richest talents in Hollywood, ""The Prestige"" is a wickedly clever and riveting tale of all consuming obsession."
I:15383;1785;This is a classic tale that simply uses rival magicians and the tricks of their trade to illustrate what all.
I:15383;1786;Bale and Jackman are terrific as the pair of rival magic men who try to destroy each other, their destructive animosity etched on their faces.
I:15383;1787;And its a showcase for the considerable talents of Christopher Nolan, who (along with his screenwriter kin Johnathon Nolan) executes one the most impressively acrobatic balancing acts in cinematic storytelling with the ease of a born illusionist.
I:15383;1788;The film, although sometimes a grueling task to follow, steadily coalesces and amply rewards the careful observer.
I:15383;1789;Besides, Wally Pfister's cinematography, which finds the right balance of elegance and grittiness, and Lee Smith's rhythmic editing practically draw the audience in.
I:15383;1790;Watch closely at the on the best films waiting to be discovered.
I:15383;1791;After starting as a kind of men compete in the mysterious business of magic.
I:15383;1792;In the quest to get more exciting tricks at least one (you can never tell whether both men) contacts tesla who creates another clever device for transporting something from one place to another.
I:15383;1793;"The tricks of both the magicians and the book become more fantastic until we have ""half people"" running around."
I:15383;1794;It cuts out about 2/3 of the book and has some pretty sparks.
I:15383;1795;Overall the movie is great.
I:15383;1796;Story is orginal and creative and keeps you thinking and wondering.
I:15383;1797;I've just revisted The Prestige after a few years and I found it quite fascinating, knowing what I did from the previous viewing and incorporating that knowledge into this viewing.
I:15383;1798;It's one of those stories with layers upon layers that you strip away a bit at a tiime.
I:15383;1799;the interplay between the rival magicians is at the heart of the film, but even though you've seen it once, when you go back and see it again with the information you think you know, you find other things you never noticed the first time.
I:15383;1800;I am certain the Nolans, in adapting the screenplay from a novel, must have felt themselves perplexed at time, like trying to make the pieces of several jigsaw puzzles all fit perfectly into one.
I:15383;1801;castingwise, it is nice to see Michael Caine together with Christian Bale (though Caine's scenes are mostly with Hugh Jackman) after Batman Begins.
I:15383;1802;Both Jackman and Bale are interesting actors.
I:15383;1803;she is lovely, in a role that doesn't require much depth,but who cares?
I:15383;1804;She could stand still for 90 minutes and still be the best thing in any film.)
I:15383;1805;Still, I'd liked to have gotten more extras for a film like this.
I:15383;1806;I thought it was incredible.
I:15383;1807;But I love LOST for the same reasons.
I:15383;1808;I loved the twist at the end!
I:15383;1809;I love when movies make you believe one thing and at the end it's something you never expected even though it was right in front of you.
I:15383;1810;this is a masterpiece of a movie, in writing, in casting, in acting, in suspense, in directing, and in setting.
I:15383;1811;Angier is the showman, while Borden has the ingenious ideas, and when Angier sees Borden perform an underproduced but mind.
I:15383;1812;The best I've ever seen .
I:15383;1813;the meaning of a good trick, as Michael Caine's character tells us, is not about learning how it's done.
I:15383;1814;And The Prestige fools us, all right.
I:15383;1815;It is an amazing film, a masterpiece in storytelling, and performs a final devastating illusion at the end that will leave the audience reeling from the impact, ready to watch it again.
I:15383;1816;This movie is a must see.
I:15383;1817;i like a movie that can do that.
I:15383;1818;If you are looking for an edge of your seat, intelligent movie, this one is for you.
I:15383;1819;I have seen about 50 or more movies this year and I have to say I enjoyed The Prestige the most.
I:15383;1820;It won't win any awards like The Departed, but it sure will entertain you.
I:15383;1821;Christian Bale is an amazing actor as always, but Hugh Jackman really surprised me here, as well as, David Bowie himself.
I:15383;1822;There are so many twists and turns I am sure you will be watching this one more than once.
I:15383;1823;While I liked The Illusionist, The Prestige is the magic film of 2006!
I:15383;1824;I have a lot of questions about this film but I enjoyed it very much.
I:15383;1825;Great directing by Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;1826;For starters, this was probably one of the best films of 2006.
I:15383;1827;This movie has so many delicious twists and turns in it.
I:15383;1828;it just makes you want more.
I:15383;1829;It's unlike any other movie, in my opinion.
I:15383;1830;Christian Bale's performance is outstanding, as is Hugh Jackman's.
I:15383;1831;The story is great, the acting is great, the directing is great, I think anyone who sees this will have to admit that it is at least very well.
I:15383;1832;I really liked how there were two twists in this story.
I:15383;1833;The idea behind Pledge/Turn/Prestige is fundamental to all art and technology.
I:15383;1834;"the climax of the trick in which the audience applauds the artistry of the performance, reflects the approval of the crowd, and the movement of the trick from the ""real"" to the ""symbolic""."
I:15383;1835;One of my all time favorites.
I:15383;1836;I am delighted, that unlike Bryan Singer and Sam Riemi, two excellent directors, that Christopher Nolan is still finding time to do normal films in between conducting one of the comic book franchises.
I:15383;1837;I loved Memento and Insomnia, and this film is another fine example of his talent.
I:15383;1838;I have yet to see The Illusionist, but look forward to comparing it with this film.
I:15383;1839;Michael Caine and the adorable Scarlett Johansson also add decent support to this interesting tale.
I:15383;1840;There are perhaps too many twists, but the two leads are excellent and it is a film that you want to watch again as soon as it finishes.
I:15383;1841;'The Prestige' is a superior film to 'The Illusionist' in many ways.
I:15383;1842;3 1/2 stars for keeping me guessing to the end.
I:15383;1843;As others have said if you like Christopher Nolan's other films you should enjoy this one.
I:15383;1844;I really liked David Bowie's potrayal of Nikolai Tesla.
I:15383;1845;I think that the reason I found The Prestige so entertaining is the fact that 1)It had a good cast of actors.
I:15383;1846;There are moments when the storyline is so seemless and dark and intriguing that I was instantly reminded of Nolan's Batman Begins.
I:15383;1847;The Prestige is a thriller.
I:15383;1848;Moving performances by Jackman and Bale.
I:15383;1849;Angier is a master showman, full of charisma, spell.
I:15383;1850;binding audiences with his charm.
I:15383;1851;Borden is a masterful illusionist, bringing the impossible alive on stage.
I:15383;1852;Each is seeking to become the greatest magician of all time, cullng their bitterness into obsession, seeking the secrets to each other's illusions.
I:15383;1853;in a time when such great cinematic distractions like Pan's Labrynth and Apocalypto were taking my attention, The Prestige was a good contender for my time.
I:15383;1854;Pure story, the way I like my movies.
I:15383;1855;Jackman and Bale have emerged a fine actors.
I:15383;1856;One of the best movies I've seen recently, the drama, intrigue and suspense in this movie are very well done.
I:15383;1857;Plus, it's filled with great actors such as Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, David Bowie and Andy Serkis.
I:15383;1858;I just saw this movie last night and it is now my favorite!
I:15383;1859;It has your eyes glued to the tv the whole time wondering what will happen next!
I:15383;1860;It's only once in a while these days, that a mainstream movie comes along that tells a defiantly original story .
I:15383;1861;entirely fitting that it should be directed by Christopher Nolan, known for his exactitude.
I:15383;1862;As the story progresses, we find ever greater depths to which the protagonists are willing to go to perfect their act.
I:15383;1863;the cast are uniformly excellent .
I:15383;1864;And co. stars Scarlett Johanssen and Michael Caine acquit themselves well, the latter especially adding gravitas to proceedings.
I:15383;1865;These quibbles are more than made up for by a fantastic cast and inventive storytelling.
I:15383;1866;fiction, and this may jar with some audiences who are at that point involved with the mystery and period detail.
I:15383;1867;other than that, a fine period mystery with superior acting and art direction.
I:15383;1868;the ILLUSIONIST was a much more entertaining period piece about magic withgood plot twists
I:15383;1869;(I hope) This is a great movie, I love to watch it over and over.
I:15383;1870;The movie was really mysterious and truly made you want to watch it again.
I:15383;1871;Im glad a bought it, it's one of those movies you have to have in your collection.
I:15383;1872;Easy and quick transaction, I got exactly what I wanted and was expecting!
I:15383;1873;Very satisfied and so was the recipient of the gift!
I:15383;1874;When I found out he was finally moving on with The Prestige, a book that he read (or maybe his brother did), I read that same book.
I:15383;1875;Movie is terrific, but if you try to watches anywhere but in a computer it will be delayed.
I:15383;1876;If you like good puzzles, then you'll probably love this film.
I:15383;1877;Good plot and mystery, with an amazing and satisfying conclusion.
I:15383;1878;Overall, a very satisfying film.
I:15383;1879;The Prestige works on many levels, as a character study and a depiction of rivalry and revenge, as a period piece that illuminates the ingenuity and sacrifice and risk required to carry off the trickery and deception of stage magic.
I:15383;1880;It is a very entertaining film, that captivated my attention throughout, was very well acted (especially by Christian Bale) and very well paced.
I:15383;1881;We accept and admire the skill and sacrifice and risk of the artists to a point .
I:15383;1882;At some level, I think this functions as an intriguing reflection on what audiences want in film: we tend to want what we see to be as realistic as possible without crossing a line to make us believe it is really real .
I:15383;1883;A film that can simultaneously do the job of being slick and entertaining, and at the same time raise intriguing and profound questions about the nature of entertainment, and of audience expectations, and of the relation between image and reality is definitely worth a look.
I:15383;1884;I know I'll be seeing it again.
I:15383;1885;It was just what I wanted and I have enjoyed the film several times since getting it.
I:15383;1886;the Film is gripping, full of suspense and mystery.
I:15383;1887;Truly its a story telling masterwork by Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;1888;This is an amazing movie.
I:15383;1889;It came on time and in perfect condition too.
I:15383;1890;$10 is definitely worth it, as I saw it three times the first week I got it.
I:15383;1891;In a way the movie forces you to get it's worth in.
I:15383;1892;This is not a movie you'll see once, I promise you.
I:15383;1893;Definitely going to watch it more in the future.
I:15383;1894;The period atmosphere is captured completely so that London of that era is beautifully rendered in low key lighting effects.
I:15383;1895;The performances are all of the highest caliber, including the principal jobs by HUGH JACKMAN and CHRISTIAN BALE as magicians jealous of each other's talent.
I:15383;1896;summing up: Definitely worth viewing.
I:15383;1897;The prestige is probably one of the best movies I've seen.
I:15383;1898;Its got 3 of the coolest actors, its mysterious and intense.
I:15383;1899;Much to my surprise, the movie soon captured my interest.
I:15383;1900;The emotions and obsessions of the two main characters was built up quite well.
I:15383;1901;The movie title is a fitting one, which can be understood once the movie has been watched.
I:15383;1902;In this movie, Tesla does manage to develop something that is truly extraordinary (in his rivalry with Thomas Edison) and the true gruesome nature of this discovery as played out in the magical act of one of the magicians is not revealed until the end.
I:15383;1903;"(As will be discovered later in the movie, this ""stunt"" has a personal effect on him and involves great sacrifice.)"
I:15383;1904;This movie is a thoroughly enjoyable one and has been compared to another movie about stage magic which recently came out called _The Illusionist_.
I:15383;1905;This movie is certainly entertaining but ultimately very gruesome and not for the overly squeamish.
I:15383;1906;It is certainly worth watching however if you can appreciate being dazzled by the uncanny individuals who practice stage magic.
I:15383;1907;There were many surprises at this year's Academy Awards.
I:15383;1908;"But a top movie it is
I:15383;1909;This is one of those movies that stands out for its inventiveness, its innovative mode of storytelling, its twists and turns at many points of the plot, and ability to make the viewer empathize with all the main characters.
I:15383;1910;Great movies have themes, and this movie has multiple.
I:15383;1911;First is obsession, not necessarily of revenge, but also of winning, of being the best, and of having what others have and more.
I:15383;1912;Both are professionals trying to reach the top of their professions, and if this means backstabbing each other, so be it.
I:15383;1913;the most impressive aspect of this movie is its mode of storytelling.
I:15383;1914;In the early 1990's, Pulp Fiction came out and introduced the circular method of showing a movie.
I:15383;1915;Overall, a great watching experience
I:15383;1916;"Once again, Christopher Nolan sets the perfect mood for the ""The Prestige"" as he did in ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia."""
I:15383;1917;David Julyan's ever present musical score is also a perfect fit in this compelling drama.
I:15383;1918;In many ways, the movie is about filmmaking, about telling a story, about suspending an audience's disbelief.
I:15383;1919;I purposely distrusted everything, and so I saw the ending far before the credits rolled.
I:15383;1920;I still enjoyed the final reveal.
I:15383;1921;On the contrary, it's quite magnificent in its resistance to being a period piece.
I:15383;1922;It's clear that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted to interpret the Victorian Age for a modern audience.
I:15383;1923;There's likely some truth to that, but there was also majesty of invention and vibrancy of ideas.
I:15383;1924;This is the era directly before television, and all of the science that would later be concentrated as entertainment was still in the raw, and it captivated and motivated many famous minds.
I:15383;1925;Interestingly enough, much of what most of us know as science comes to us in the form of entertainment, a la Mythbusters and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
I:15383;1926;The Prestige reveals the birth of modern entertainment as the meeting of magic and science.
I:15383;1927;the movie captures something else about the Victorian Age.
I:15383;1928;When you see a Victorian machine or tool, you see the labor and intellect that must have gone into its production.
I:15383;1929;In the end, I still think it was cheap, but it works because the film, as I mention above, is on some level about filmmaking and the production of entertainment.
I:15383;1930;Nolan brings a lot of people (not only actors, but much of the crew) from Batman Begins, and the result is a movie that looks very similar.
I:15383;1931;David Bowie is a pleasant surprise as Tesla, one of the greatest scientists in history.
I:15383;1932;memento remains Nolan's masterpiece, but The Prestige will satisfy a much larger crowd.
I:15383;1933;I feel like Nolan had one important thing to film, which he announces in Following and finishes in Memento.
I:15383;1934;The Prestige accomplishes this dual task quite well.
I:15383;1935;It was so great, the movie kept you guessing.
I:15383;1936;I enjoyed the intelligent character development and the creative use of Tesla .
I:15383;1937;I also had just viewed The Departed, which received rave reviews, and in my opinion lived up to them.
I:15383;1938;jackman is the initially charming performer who is eventually driven to obsession.
I:15383;1939;All actors are excellent, including Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis.
I:15383;1940;Andy Serkis deserves special recognition for his small role.
I:15383;1941;Piper Parabo has little onscreen time, but she manages to look lovely.
I:15383;1942;That's where I found the surprises.
I:15383;1943;The film forces you to be patient and let the connections unfold.
I:15383;1944;cinematography, outfits, and the setting are beautiful and add to the eerie atmosphere.
I:15383;1945;Others have compared The Prestige to Sleuth, and the disturbing competition brought Sleuth to my mind.
I:15383;1946;Its running themes were threaded into the story well.
I:15383;1947;"One theme involved us all wanting to be tricked
I:15383;1948;the title of The Prestige has an interesting significance.
I:15383;1949;I'd recommend this curious, meticulously intriguing, and troubling movie to those who enjoyed Memento and don't expect a hurried film or one with much comic relief.
I:15383;1950;Movie had you on the edge of your seat for the whole time!
I:15383;1951;Ending was great and really made you think!
I:15383;1952;anyway, this movie was amazing.
I:15383;1953;I watched the movie pretty closely so I feel confident that I can clear some stuff up for those people who have questions.
I:15383;1954;He set up 100 shows cause he knew that eventually Borden would come.
I:15383;1955;She is driven to drink by the hot and cold treatment she is getting from the brothers cause one of them doesnt love her then she kills herself.
I:15383;1956;In one scene he is telling his twin she knows something isnt right talk to her and convince her I love her.
I:15383;1957;This amazing movie has landed in my favorites/repeated watch collection!!!
I:15383;1958;Genius of a movie with a twist, even a few, movie making is high art and great storytelling, this is no exception.
I:15383;1959;GREAT movie, pay attention though!
I:15383;1960;I had high hopes for this one.
I:15383;1961;Great actors, period piece, mystery, magic.
I:15383;1962;A decently entertaining movie, but you'll really need to exercise your suspension of disbelief.
I:15383;1963;It was great to see Bale and Jackman work together.
I:15383;1964;They both did an excellent job.
I:15383;1965;Michael Caine is always superb.
I:15383;1966;Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.
I:15383;1967;This was a gift, so we were very pleased with the product and service.
I:15383;1968;This movie and The Illusionist are both great.
I:15383;1969;The pace and scope of the story is great and I enjoy the actors performances.
I:15383;1970;Hugh Jackman is one of my favorite actors.
I:15383;1971;Bought this for a friend, and will definitely want to see it.
I:15383;1972;Haven't had a chance yet, but fast, prompt service, and would recommend to anyone.
I:15383;1973;Very intriguing movie, great acting.
I:15383;1974;You have to stay focused to keep up, but well worth it.
I:15383;1975;It kept you on the edge of your seat and guessing.
I:15383;1976;I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anybody!
I:15383;1977;The opening scene tells you to pay close attention.
I:15383;1978;This movie will leave you dumbfounded at the end.
I:15383;1979;Simply drooling with your mouth open dumbfounded.
I:15383;1980;Definitely one of the top 5 thrillers I've ever seen.
I:15383;1981;The Illusionist is a better film than this one.
I:15383;1982;"By contract, ""The Illusionist"" pulls off its big finish, emerging not only as the more intelligent and well."
I:15383;1983;acted but also the more satisfying film.
I:15383;1984;I thought it was a wonderful performance with a unique story line.
I:15383;1985;Great mix of actors who all exude their talents!
I:15383;1986;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman do a great job in this movie!
I:15383;1987;The second viewing is just as good because you can see all the clues and all the foreshadowing you missed the first time around.
I:15383;1988;They will do whatever it takes and you will be surprised as to how far they will go and who comes out on top in the end.
I:15383;1989;i would also recommend other Christopher Nolan films, especially Memento and Inception.
I:15383;1990;Let me just say that I loved Memento.
I:15383;1991;It's now one of my favorites, and I'll be watching it multiple times
I:15383;1992;I gave this to my son for Christmas and he loves it he was looking forward to this under our tree
I:15383;1993;I enjoyed this movie and would rate it as the second best movie I saw in the theaters last year (after The Departed).
I:15383;1994;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play very convincing roles and succeed brilliantly in drawing you into and submersing you in their endless cycle of revenge.
I:15383;1995;Yeah, but, overall, this is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and is much darker than I anticipated.
I:15383;1996;"I've never been big on magicians, but this one definitely had me saying ""wow""."
I:15383;1997;this one definitely leaves you wanting to make peace with people.
I:15383;1998;"The film version of The Prestige actually pulls something off that's very rare
I:15383;1999;"What the Nolan brothers actually improved on, was the heart of the story
I:15383;2000;Both Bale and Jackman are excellent in their roles, as is Michael Cane.
I:15383;2001;In the book, there is a fascinating back story involving the children of the two magicians meeting years later, which has been completely left out, and the final scene in the novel is far more unsettling and actually darker then what made it onto the screen.
I:15383;2002;But having said all that, the film works on so many levels, that i can forgive the changes that were made.
I:15383;2003;At the end of the film, you do indeed want to watch it again, which is always a sign of a great movie.
I:15383;2004;ahh moment to be effective and fully appreciated by an audience, it must be preceded by The Pledge and The Turn .
I:15383;2005;ahh moment is conducted over a three.
I:15383;2006;hand, the audience has to work hard (on a single viewing) to recognize all of the co. writer/director's considerable effort and talent .
I:15383;2007;Tragedy, pride and injustice can certainly produce a compelling scene or two.
I:15383;2008;from a casting perspective, Christian Bale is probably the film's strongest point.
I:15383;2009;established cult following, but he's doubtless best known for his performance in Batman Begins.
I:15383;2010;Most memorable in that role as Bruce Wayne was the unceremonious manner in which he dismissed a group of party guests.
I:15383;2011;with the greatest respect, I think it's time for Michael Caine to turn down each and every role that requires him to speak with his native cockney accent.
I:15383;2012;rebecca Hall, as Sarah Borden, is excellent, even though her character's extreme psychological progression happens a little too swiftly.
I:15383;2013;scarlett Johansson is good and quite the temptress, though it may have been preferable to cast a less flavor.
I:15383;2014;month type of actress for her role.
I:15383;2015;It was all a bit distracting and amusing at the time .
I:15383;2016;and more amusing still when I discovered that David Bowie actually was the actor playing the role of Nikolas Tesla.
I:15383;2017;deprecating humor), I'll soldier on and offer some parting thoughts.
I:15383;2018;ahh is very well done, but not faultless.
I:15383;2019;the Prestige is an audacious, clever, clinically crafted film, and should end up a favorite amongst the twist.
I:15383;2020;I very nearly thought the film's premise was incredibly insightful .
I:15383;2021;yet which truth are we referred to?I almost thought it was a great movie
I:15383;2022;I am sure a lot of international audience would enjoy this movie.
I:15383;2023;The Prestige was one of the few Christian Bale movies that I had not seen, and it was a fun movie to watch.
I:15383;2024;It's interesting that The Prestige and The Illusionist came out so closely together.
I:15383;2025;I saw The Illusionist in the theater and totally loved it.
I:15383;2026;the cast is first rate.
I:15383;2027;Any film that features Michael Caine and David Bowie is probably worth seeing.
I:15383;2028;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both very good.
I:15383;2029;What a contrast with the inspired ending of The Illusionist.
I:15383;2030;The Prestige was a very good movie.
I:15383;2031;Had to look online for detailed explanation.
I:15383;2032;A film that lives up to its promise in all ways.
I:15383;2033;Great performances, direction, setting, dialogue, writing and editing.
I:15383;2034;"getting into, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Sleuth"" territory."
I:15383;2035;"I had a great want to see The Prestige because of my own love of ""magic"" and illusions."
I:15383;2036;I have a friend who does magic on the side and I learned things by default from hanging around him.
I:15383;2037;All the twists are what made it a wonderful experience for me.
I:15383;2038;I felt the cast was well picked and the actors gave their hearts to it all.
I:15383;2039;The movie was a delight and if you don't like this movie I feel bad for you!
I:15383;2040;Science fiction meets history in this fascinating tale of competing magicians.
I:15383;2041;The ending will surprise you, and make you think.
I:15383;2042;Great performances by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman with an ending that should surprise most people.
I:15383;2043;Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall, and Piper Perabo also give strong support as the women in the lives of the two dueling showmen, as does Michael Caine as the brains behind Jackman's Robert Angiers and later The Great Danton.
I:15383;2044;David Bowie is also competent in his appearance as the reclusive Nicola Tesla, and Samantha Mehurin as Bale's daughter is a delightful surprise.
I:15383;2045;This is one of my favorite thriller movies.
I:15383;2046;Great acting by Christien Bale (Batman) and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) Michael Cain (The Dark Knight).
I:15383;2047;Yes, he is perfect as Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;2048;the first time you watch this movie you will be hooked.
I:15383;2049;Tied up and hooked, actually.
I:15383;2050;tell you how they did it.
I:15383;2051;They lead you by the hand through the clues and make sure you know how they did it.
I:15383;2052;This is a great movie for movie lovers that love to keep their eyes glued to the screen.
I:15383;2053;Lots of twists and turns in the story to keep you watching for what happens next.
I:15383;2054;This is the movie you haver to see.
I:15383;2055;The magic is awsome and it is the best movie with a twist that I have ever seen.
I:15383;2056;It is a confusing movie so it is best to watch it when there is peace and quit so you can fully understand it.
I:15383;2057;The Prestige is a film with rich sets, high profile actors (Jackman, Bale, Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie), and other makings of a popcorn movie.
I:15383;2058;He then travels to find a new variation that may very well beat Borden's.
I:15383;2059;this is an amazing film from all aspects.
I:15383;2060;The cinematography(Feels similar to Nolan's other film Batman Begins) fits perfectly, there are mysterious sets, good acting, an interesting plot, and a building score.
I:15383;2061;The prestige works well because of the consistent build up of rivalry and desperation.
I:15383;2062;I highly recommend picking this up.
I:15383;2063;Not a masterpiece, but a great popcorn film to watch on a rainy day.
I:15383;2064;This is a phenomenal piece of cinema.
I:15383;2065;backs, and use of dialog are thrilling.
I:15383;2066;This may have come from the novel, but it's a feat to translate anything so complicated with such purity when adapting forms.
I:15383;2067;David Bowie and Christian Bale, in particular, give remarkably nuanced performances.
I:15383;2068;right down to one of the final whispers.
I:15383;2069;I was also impressed with Hugh Jackman's final scene in the film, and how earlier he made such a perfect showman.
I:15383;2070;The cinematography and lighting no doubt had a lot to do with it, but I'll give him credit for really filling out the role.
I:15383;2071;Make sure to see this before it leaves the theaters, in an auditorium with good, loud sound, tight fine focus, and a bright lamp.
I:15383;2072;The other watchable facet is that some actors turn in great performances, stuff far above and beyond what the dopey plot calls for.
I:15383;2073;It's fun to watch Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, and Andy Serkis here, because they for some reason decided to turn in excellently realistic characters.
I:15383;2074;I bought the movie so I could see the whole thing.
I:15383;2075;Although I thought The Illusionist was a good movie, The Prestige offers so much more complexity to the story and overall was excellent.
I:15383;2076;I thought the cast was a perfect fit for all the characters!
I:15383;2077;I loved the plot twist and the suspense.
I:15383;2078;the appearance of Nikola Tesla as a supporting character in the story, fits nicely within this allegory, serving as a reminder of that same obsessed rivalry between inventors Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison .
I:15383;2079;"both ""magicians"" of their day."
I:15383;2080;just like a magic act, any good movie about magicians will have misdirection, and illusion, and a surprise at the end, and I certainly thought that The Prestige delivered on that.
I:15383;2081;after just one viewing, this movie has easily found its way into my top ten.
I:15383;2082;This is a daring film.
I:15383;2083;First, it's two leads are wonderfully gifted actors but neither of them play very pleasant fellows.
I:15383;2084;There are intriguing jumps in the timeline of events that kept me seated.
I:15383;2085;Supportive characters to the drama are spot on and bear the emotional weight of the obsessive leads.
I:15383;2086;What some people reviewing this film take issue with is, to me, the daring part of the film.
I:15383;2087;The best part is that while this magician has a clear edge it is a tragic one, one that drains his humanity the more he uses it.
I:15383;2088;This is an imaginative, sad, cautionary and thoroughly unusual film.
I:15383;2089;Besides theacting being over the top Nolan knows how to keep you fascianted on what is going on.
I:15383;2090;The second time I am able to take it all in.
I:15383;2091;obsession not love (the Illusionist is a magical romance) motivates the two Magicians.
I:15383;2092;I was pulled into the story by the wonderful magic and trying to figure out what I was missing.
I:15383;2093;Before I begin the proper review of the movie itself a quick word about the director Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;2094;Nolan is quickly becoming one of the greatest directors of our time.
I:15383;2095;All his works have been quite diverse and exceptional.
I:15383;2096;MEMENTO and BATMAN BEGINS are two of my all time favorite movies and INSOMNIA was a pretty decent thriller.
I:15383;2097;"when THE PRESTIGE was announced I immediately thought ""this has to be the best movie to come out in a long time!"""
I:15383;2098;especially since I've been a huge fan of Nolan and Bale's previous works.
I:15383;2099;Simply put, both of them are among some of the most talented people in the movie business right now!THE PRESTIGE is based on a novel by Christopher Priest.
I:15383;2100;The intense rivalry and it's effect on the two men's lives and those they love is the main focus of the story.
I:15383;2101;There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end.
I:15383;2102;And I personally loved how everything was tied up in the end.
I:15383;2103;This is one of those movies where you will be compelled to watch again after it's over!
I:15383;2104;and again!The direction is wonderful.
I:15383;2105;If you loved BATMAN BEGINS, THE PRESTIGE is a treat to watch.
I:15383;2106;This is a film that's meant to be watched carefully.
I:15383;2107;picking up clues the director leaves for you.
I:15383;2108;The production values are amazing, the sets are gorgeous and the entire look of the film is a joy to watch.
I:15383;2109;"Simply, this is one of the best looking films you'll see this year!Coming to the cast, how can you ever go wrong with a cast the includes Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen, Piper Perabo, Andy ""Gollum"" Serkis and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla?"
I:15383;2110;Christian Bale is once again awesome!
I:15383;2111;He has a psycho vibe going on throughout the film.
I:15383;2112;Hugh Jackman also gives a decent performance, in fact his character was the most complex and he fit the part perfectly.
I:15383;2113;Another success for him this year!
I:15383;2114;Michael Caine is great, as always and David Bowie makes this movie extra cool as the enigmatic scientist Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;2115;It's one of the best films to come out in a long time!
I:15383;2116;Great direction, an interesting and complex plot and an amazing cast.
I:15383;2117;The film's great for eye.
I:15383;2118;candy, the cast is gorgeous and the illusions are good.
I:15383;2119;loved the one piece of history regarding Tesla and Colorado Springs.
I:15383;2120;true and would make a film in and of itself.
I:15383;2121;Both have found the ultimate trick, the transported man, involving exact doubles.
I:15383;2122;The Prestige (Christopher Nolan, 2006)I remember, back at the beginning of 2006, a lot of talk about two movies with similar storylines coming out: Neil Burger's The Illusionist and Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.
I:15383;2123;Both period pieces featuring magicians, with big stars I like in the lead roles (Edward Norton and Christian Bale, respectively), both with a big mystery at the forefront.
I:15383;2124;The Prestige also picked up a nom for Best Art Direction.
I:15383;2125;Well, I've now seen both, and while they're both enjoyable, I'm coming down on the side of the apes in this debate: I liked The Illusionist a lot better.
I:15383;2126;Much of the movie is told in flashback, showing us the manipulations that led to the trial.
I:15383;2127;"and this is its greatest weakness
I:15383;2128;"On the upside, however, you've got an amazing stable of actors (aside from the above, a quick core sample reveals Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, David Bowie, and Ricky Jay), and they all perform at least reasonably well, while Nolan's directing still seems to be climbing back up
I:15383;2129;"still, for all that, if you can figure out the time element in The Prestige, which may take a few viewings, it's got a meaty mystery, some great emotional manipulation (by the characters, not by the director
I:15383;2130;manipulative Hollywood these days), and a fun, if predictable, twist.
I:15383;2131;I won't go into the later since it leads to spoilers, but I will say that I rarely if ever enjoy revenge as a major theme in a film.
I:15383;2132;I personally enjoyed the latter more than THE PRESTIGE simply because while it also contained a revenge element, it also focused on the possibility of uniting separated lovers.
I:15383;2133;No such uplifting theme accompanies THE PRESTIGE.
I:15383;2134;Albeit a highly entertaining downer.
I:15383;2135;There is a wonderful period feel to the entire thing and it looked great from beginning to end.
I:15383;2136;Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were superb in their roles at the heart of the picture.
I:15383;2137;Michael Caine, who teamed with both Nolan and Bale in BATMAN BEGINS, is as welcome as always.
I:15383;2138;Still, it was nice to see Perabo in a decent role in a major film, playing Jackman's wife early in the film.
I:15383;2139;i definitely recommend the film and I imagine that those not so intent as I was to figure out what the future twists in the film might it enjoy it a lot more than I did.
I:15383;2140;Few films are as expertly crafted as this one.
I:15383;2141;Despite being somewhat fantastic in its story, it also provides imaginative food for thought on a few philosophical and social questions.
I:15383;2142;But what I did see keep my eyes glued to the tube.
I:15383;2143;I was drawn to this movie because I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's other movies, such as Momento.
I:15383;2144;I found the movie quite entertaining, and enjoyed piecing together the various plot clues and anticipating the 'twist' likely to occur at the conclusion.
I:15383;2145;quite to the contrary, the ending of the movie is pure sci.
I:15383;2146;fi, and it cheapened a film which otherwise featured fantastic but logical screenplay.
I:15383;2147;And I was pleasantly surprised by every possible aspect.
I:15383;2148;The film boasts a spetacular a. list cast that serves its characters in the best possible way.
I:15383;2149;I wasn't aware of the fact that the film is based on a novel, nontheless, the plot is intriguing, suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:15383;2150;"i love the fact that it does not take place in modern times, but about a century ago
I:15383;2151;I was happy to see it did well at the box.
I:15383;2152;"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation ."
I:15383;2153;a tale of two master magicians in turn.
I:15383;2154;rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co. writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel.
I:15383;2155;The solid production values .
I:15383;2156;meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography .
I:15383;2157;offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core.
I:15383;2158;scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight.
I:15383;2159;hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi.
I:15383;2160;the performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.
I:15383;2161;Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.
I:15383;2162;Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale work together again bringing us a film about two men who start as professional rivals and begin a steady decline into obsession and revenge.
I:15383;2163;Visually the film is dark, mysterious and filled with a Victorian mystique that serves the film quite well.
I:15383;2164;Sound work matches the visuals, especially during the magic scenes and moments later in the film when electricity comes into play.
I:15383;2165;acting is solid all around.
I:15383;2166;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman carry most of the weight around in the movie.
I:15383;2167;Both men are convincing and as they both begin to escalate the affairs, become more intense and disarming.
I:15383;2168;It was also nice to see Andy Serkis in a small but memorable role (and not covered up by digital effects).
I:15383;2169;Samantha Mahurin also does a great job as Bale's beleaguered wife.
I:15383;2170;The actor playing Nikola Tesla (its a fun bit of casting that I won't spoil) also does a very good job.
I:15383;2171;the script is deceptively simple, but Nolan's knack with editing makes the movie twist and turn upon itself.
I:15383;2172;At first its a bit disorienting, but once you catch up with the film its a great ride.
I:15383;2173;Anyone else familiar with Nolan's previous work (Insomnia and Memento) should be right at home.
I:15383;2174;Overall, a very entertaining film and one that could be more rewarding with the second viewing.
I:15383;2175;Neither film really benefited from it.
I:15383;2176;Nevertheless, the film does keep your interest and keeps you guessing.
I:15383;2177;"I thought the film was worth seeing and it was entertaining, but unlike many of the other reviewers here I didn't think it was ""one of the best movies of the year""."
I:15383;2178;The Prestige is entertaining but not a great film.
I:15383;2179;"admittedly, ""The Prestige"" has a lot of ground to cover."
I:15383;2180;There are a lot of tricks and counter.
I:15383;2181;i had at least looked forward to seeing how the famous real.
I:15383;2182;As fantastic as many of Tesla's experiments with electricity actually were, his results are carried to absurd extremes for the purposes of this plot.
I:15383;2183;out appearance here clashed with expectation.
I:15383;2184;but the movie does have an intricate plot with some challenging twists and turns.
I:15383;2185;So, as a member of the audience, watch closely, keep an open mind, and expect the unexpected.
I:15383;2186;realization that you will find most haunting.
I:15383;2187;She says that the day he means it makes her life worthwhile' .
I:15383;2188;you'll enjoy that more than this movie!!
I:15383;2189;His movies are always well done with smart scripts.
I:15383;2190;even though he is notorious for not having audio commentaries or a slew of special features, the movie itself is a must watch with an incredible twist.
I:15383;2191;I consider it one of the best movies ever
I:15383;2192;The movie's scenario is one of the most complicated scenarios I've ever seen, and that what makes this film special and enjoyable.
I:15383;2193;if you like science thrilling movies then this movie is for you!
I:15383;2194;This is a wonderful movie that looks and sounds fantastic on blu ray.
I:15383;2195;If you're into a really interesting story that keeps you guessing all the way through this is it.
I:15383;2196;There's a couple of pretty cool extras too.
I:15383;2197;plot,characterization,setting all work well together.
I:15383;2198;Very good acting as well!
I:15383;2199;A fine cast,that worked vry well together.
I:15383;2200;How much do I LOVE this movie?It has wonderful actors .
I:15383;2201;Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine (love Michael Caine), Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo and I just discovered that David Bowie played one of the characters.
I:15383;2202;the story line is excellent and the editing is tight, almost stingy.
I:15383;2203;every character was convincing and Bale and Jackman are extremely intense as rival magicians.
I:15383;2204;I am a huge fan of unorthodox films, particularly ones that do not follow chronological order, like 21 Grams and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
I:15383;2205;It employs the tool just enough to keep the plot interesting, revealing lots of surprises along the way.
I:15383;2206;Interesting movie with an interesting plot that makes you think.
I:15383;2207;If you're a Tesla fan, you'll be pleasantly surprised how he fits into the story.
I:15383;2208;"This film is as disappointing as ""The Illusionist"" is satisfying, surprising, and representative of imaginative movie."
I:15383;2209;part drama that comprises a master magician's illusion.
I:15383;2210;"When the trick passes this ""reality test,"" the result is an amazed and delighted spectator who asks ""how"" did they do that?"
I:15383;2211;"taste and greater respect for superior films like ""The Illusionist"" and Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks."
I:15383;2212;"argument to my position (I won't elevate the above response to an ""argument""), see the first commentary (below) by OBrien, who works out the ""logic"" of the trick with persuasive if not compelling points."
I:15383;2213;"sufficient to suggest that ""The Prestige"" not merely rivals the sophistication of ""The Illusionist"" but exceeds it!"
I:15383;2214;"it's hard sometimes to know what one likes
I:15383;2215;"Journals (words) enable any of us to defy the laws of physical reality (we constantly confront the presence of absence with language, restoring to the present the ""thing"" that is otherwise no longer physically present to us)."
I:15383;2216;so the film may be both ingenious and deeply philosophical (thereby refuting my position that it resorts to common deus ex machina, sci.

I:15383;2218;"The magician Borden tells his wife that he loves her and she answers: ""Sometimes you say that and don't mean it, which is all right because it makes sweeter the times when you actually do mean it."""
I:15383;2219;"Prestige is a word that has little to do with love and everything to do with power and, more importantly, ""pride"" (or that deadly nemesis ""hubris"")."
I:15383;2220;magnificent obsession of either one.
I:15383;2221;star rating for the magician who will put everything on the line to make his beloved reappear.]
I:15383;2222;The story is clever, the pacing is just right, sets, costumes, and acting are impeccable.
I:15383;2223;The movie itself is a great magic trick.
I:15383;2224;This movie is suspenseful and is one of those films that you want to watch again because of the ending.
I:15383;2225;"I must say it is interesting to see Jackman, Bowie, and Bale in a ""historical"" piece like this, so this movie's asset is mostly how unusual it is."
I:15383;2226;This is an entertaining movie with lots of plot twists, mystery, and intrigue.
I:15383;2227;star cast including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson and you have the ingredients for a great movie.
I:15383;2228;Hugh surprisingly holds his own and the movie kept my interest.
I:15383;2229;As much as I liked this one, I liked The Illusionist a bit better.
I:15383;2230;I had really great expectations for this film and I was looking forward to see it, especially after I saw 'The Illusionist' recently.
I:15383;2231;and that doesn't mean this movie is bad as in fact, it is a very good movie.
I:15383;2232;The acting by Caine, Jackman and Bale is just superb, and the mood is very well captured.
I:15383;2233;it's just a mystery with a suprising final.
I:15383;2234;Can't say, although I have a tendency to favor 'The Illusionist' but I guess both films are well worth watching as both films have their surprises, excellent acting, great mood capturing with good photography.
I:15383;2235;it was refreshing to see David Bowie in 'The Prestige' and too bad he hasn't been in too many films throughout his life as he's an excellent actor too.
I:15383;2236;if the interest is predominantly in magic and the ultimate tricks and illusions, then most Criss Angel episodes will be more interesting and do it more justice in this regard than both of these films.
I:15383;2237;But again, 'The Prestige' as well as 'The Illusionists' are very good films and are enjoyable.
I:15383;2238;"The Prestige is an absolutely brilliant movie
I:15383;2239;Sure, it serves as shock value, and makes you realize just how far Angiers is willing to go, but it's the sort of deus ex machina that's unexpected in a Nolan movie.
I:15383;2240;I won't retell the story, but I found this to be a very well.
I:15383;2241;made film with a lot of intricacies to hold my attention.
I:15383;2242;It is a story of competition, love, vengeance, betrayal and blind ambition.
I:15383;2243;While it could be described as a dramatic period piece, it also manages to work in a bit of science fiction.
I:15383;2244;While many seemed to be put off by this combination, I thought that it was quite well done via the appearance of Nikola Tesla (played by David Bowie).
I:15383;2245;while the story was complex and wide.
I:15383;2246;Although I figured out most of the tricks and twists before they were revealed, they were still very interesting.
I:15383;2247;but, overall, a very good film.
I:15383;2248;The Prestige is a stunning movie on many levels: wild story, well.
I:15383;2249;resolved plot, period piece beauty, great acting and a Sixth Sense style reveal that drops the steam punk tale firmly into scifi.
I:15383;2250;Christian Bale is solid, Hugh Jakcman is good, and Michael Cain is his usual sensational self.
I:15383;2251;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:15383;2252;Every turn was a new surprise.
I:15383;2253;It was a see again movie.
I:15383;2254;Nolan is a great filmmaker and this is a great film about some magicians and their obsession with beating one another by doing the best trick.
I:15383;2255;That's not a great description but just watch the movie and enjoy it.
I:15383;2256;Was a great movie and we had no streaming issues!
I:15383;2257;If you like magic and mystery drama it is a good movie
I:15383;2258;It will allow you more insight into what is already a remarkable (and grossly misjudged by the looks of prior reviews), and interesting film.
I:15383;2259;This was one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.
I:15383;2260;This is a great movie.
I:15383;2261;A great story that will keep you guessing untill the end.
I:15383;2262;The acting is wonderful and of course on Blu.
I:15383;2263;Jackman and Bale are great, they have amazing chemistry, you can feel the loathing and admiration between the two of them, the hate each other, yet are drawn together by their love of magic and one uping and humilating the other.
I:15383;2264;This movie is good from start to finish and the twist at the end is fantastic, im not sure the best man won, but you can judge for yourself.
I:15383;2265;I absolutely love this movie and was so glad to finally own it!
I:15383;2266;It will be a CHristmas present for my sister, who also loves it.
I:15383;2267;Although this film is a bit long for its subject matter, it is awe inspiring and nothing more than brilliant.
I:15383;2268;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry this film perfectly as rivaling magicians seeking revenge upon one another.
I:15383;2269;David Bowie is also surprisingly good in his role as Telsa.
I:15383;2270;it's been years since I've seen THAT kind of film that keeps you totally guessing till the end.
I:15383;2271;the characters do a good job of showing you something else to make you forget what you are supposed to be looking out for.
I:15383;2272;"It gives you that ""A. ha!"""
I:15383;2273;"Some of the tricks' secrets are revealed which will have you saying, ""I always wondered how they did that!"
I:15383;2274;The color and tone of this film definitely makes it a period piece so if you enjoy those type films, you will love this one.
I:15383;2275;Definitely a film that keeps you guessing till the end.
I:15383;2276;All three elements of magic, including an amazing prestige, are here for your enjoyment!Watch closely!
I:15383;2277;"But the end had me saying ""That's a great ending."""
I:15383;2278;The Illusionist is a wonderful movie, but it does tie everything into a nice neat and sentimental bow at the end.
I:15383;2279;magic, illusion, the modern age, it's all there for you to ponder.
I:15383;2280;One more comment, Christian Bale gives yet another great performance.
I:15383;2281;He has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business today.
I:15383;2282;This has grown to become one of my absolutely favorite movies of all time.
I:15383;2283;Great acting, great plot, great everything!!!
I:15383;2284;This is a great movie, lots of twists and pretty unexpected turns.
I:15383;2285;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:15383;2286;This had the makings of an amazing movie.
I:15383;2287;Both films leave a lasting impression of the viewer, but this one is so much more visceral.
I:15383;2288;The subtleties really sell it for me, in Jackman's last half hour we really see him shine.
I:15383;2289;Bale is solid throughout as always.
I:15383;2290;Unlike a previous reviewer I thought Christian Bales cockney accent was very convincing and Hugh Jackman without his Wolverine makeup is only just recognisable.
I:15383;2291;Both lead actors are excellent and the supporting cast are good as well.
I:15383;2292;David Bowie has an important cameo role in the film, on which the main plot hinges.
I:15383;2293;the plot is quite complicated to follow in places, so you do have to concentrate, as various sequences move backward or forward in time.
I:15383;2294;I enjoyed all the performances and I always relish seeing David Bowie.
I:15383;2295;Definitely one that still pops up in my mind, wondering exactly what happened.
I:15383;2296;Must've been something that I read.
I:15383;2297;Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with both, because both were thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.
I:15383;2298;a lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic.
I:15383;2299;in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so.
I:15383;2300;the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, as are the diabolical ways in which each rival gets in the way of the other.
I:15383;2301;hero adventure that Nolan's last outing was (Batman Begins (Two.
I:15383;2302;disc Special Edition)), but The Prestige delivers its monies worth.
I:15383;2303;my recommendation is to see for yourself.
I:15383;2304;Great acting, twists, drama .
I:15383;2305;It features many of Nolan's artistic touches, including his trademark out.
I:15383;2306;Angier is more concerned with showmanship and accolades than with the magic itself, while for Borden the craft is what consumes him, audience be damned.
I:15383;2307;The lengths each will go to in order to achieve their ideal, and simultaneously outshine the other, provides the key to the mystery that ties the whole story together.
I:15383;2308;You might guess the one halfway through, but the second is very cleverly concealed by Noland's deft direction.
I:15383;2309;Among the two I prefer the The Prestige, which I find is deeper and handled more maturely.
I:15383;2310;forward film, and while some might resent the sci.
I:15383;2311;"Both Angier and Borden are developed to a much greater extent than any character in The Illusionist
I:15383;2312;In fact, it is their very humanity, their frailties, that warp their passion into obsession, and finally into hatred and revenge.
I:15383;2313;featuring Scarlett Johansson as the love interest and David Bowie in a great turn as Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;2314;This is basically a good, but not great, movie.
I:15383;2315;There are plot twists aplenty.
I:15383;2316;Even though I figured out one big reveal early on, there were lots of other mysteries and surprises to keep my mind engaged.
I:15383;2317;"the only problem, the reason I'm giving it a merely ""above average"" review, is that it was all so cleverly done for about half the movie."
I:15383;2318;I was having fun trying to keep up!
I:15383;2319;I found that quite disappointing and it detracted a lot from my enjoyment.
I:15383;2320;I love the Chris Nolan and Christian Bale partnership.
I:15383;2321;This is a fantastic movie with great acting.
I:15383;2322;got it in the mail just as promised.
I:15383;2323;Very good condition, brand new thank you!
I:15383;2324;If you like tales of mystery, suspense, and revenge, then this film is for you.
I:15383;2325;If you're not watching again because you missed important plot points, you're probably watching it again because you really enjoyed it.
I:15383;2326;whether or not you understand the plot, this film will haunt you by the great performances of Bale, Jackman, and Michael Cain as the Engineer.
I:15383;2327;The voiceovers were done great as both magicians read both diaries througout the movie.
I:15383;2328;They draw you into the story and you wonder what will be the next move performed by each rival.
I:15383;2329;The dialogue between characters and overall emotions were done perfect.
I:15383;2330;What I mean by that is Borden and Angier and the cast of characters around them are entirely believable.
I:15383;2331;He has extraordinary potential as an actor.
I:15383;2332;Bale, being a Brit himself, managed to come up with a wildly thicker accent than he actually has and it plays in perfectly with his character.
I:15383;2333;Again, Andy Serkis is best known for his fabulous performance in the Lord of the Rings films, however he will surprise you in this one with his quirky accent and actions.
I:15383;2334;It's a complex film with intertwining stories with a tragic end.
I:15383;2335;this is a great film that everyone should enjoy, and is worth watching over and over again.
I:15383;2336;Thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie.
I:15383;2337;What a great story it is!
I:15383;2338;Great cast, lots of story layers, time shifting, and plenty of sleight of hand!
I:15383;2339;Keeps you thinking, guessing and completely entertained!
I:15383;2340;This movie is great for those who love a good challenge!
I:15383;2341;this along with the illusionist became one of the great spectacles of 2006.2007.
I:15383;2342;Featuring a great cast Caine, Jackman, bowie, and bale.
I:15383;2343;prestige is a nearly seemless look at trickery and deception that leaves you guessing to the end.
I:15383;2344;a delightful film to watch and one that will make you interested in learning your history too.
I:15383;2345;this was one of the better films of the year.
I:15383;2346;What can be said so early in the game about one of the greatest films ever made?
I:15383;2347;the Prestige is not the greatest film ever made, but it does belong in that special group of films that breaks the mold, sets a framework to be emulated and creates something within the film that is greater than the film itself.
I:15383;2348;More questions than answers are put to the viewer as the movie progresses and the film has qualities that stay with the viewer long after the film has ended, creating debate.
I:15383;2349;One wonders if these things are a matter of coincidence or strong wrangling of studio one.
I:15383;2350;Steampunk is usually defined as:works set in an era or world where steam power is still widely used.
I:15383;2351;That discussion aside, Steampunk references can easily be found in earlier works such as The Wild Wild West Television series and a few select novels.
I:15383;2352;during the late 1990's and well into the next century, film makers began to fully realize the genre and embrace it with both hands.
I:15383;2353;steampunk on film is usually represented with mechanistic devices that appear new to the eye and in perfect working order and placed in a setting that does not seem out.
I:15383;2354;genre is that the reader and the viewer both have to believe that the Steampunk elements are perfectly sewn into the fabric of the world being presented.
I:15383;2355;The items that get presented for the first time, like the brass scope on Doc Brown's large.
I:15383;2356;This is a minor distinction for the viewer and may seem tedious to read, but it is an important point and widely argued by the artists and craftspeople that spend their time making said objects.
I:15383;2357;The difference between new and used is as important for effect as moonlight and sunlight.
I:15383;2358;The two are distinct and both have their own place.
I:15383;2359;masters to believe that extra.
I:15383;2360;Future filmmaker's will most likely depend upon it heavily as the information age wanes and something newer emerges.
I:15383;2361;light romance, which is specific in centering on already established figures in history.
I:15383;2362;light romance is newly defined and the protagonists are amalgams of people that once lived and made their fortunes like the fictional Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.
I:15383;2363;undoubtedly, as all new ages emerge, they are often met with both wonder and fear as it is the unknown that approaches and the unknown being man's greatest fear.
I:15383;2364;While Roger Ebert has enjoyed a very distinguished career in the public eye as a film critic and probably the only critic within the culture that has risen to such a height doing so, thus far, he has an uncanny ability to see past some of the greatest films released on his watch.
I:15383;2365;fiction classic that ended up proving to be seen as the most perfect Science.
I:15383;2366;fiction film ever made and also one of the best films of all time.
I:15383;2367;While the community at large, often prides itself on promoting themselves as individual thinkers, if Ebert had not been so flippant toward The Prestige, it is easy, and simple, to surmise that the others would have followed suit as is often the case with mainstream reviewing.
I:15383;2368;a little slow to start but it opens up to be quite interesting.
I:15383;2369;A thrilling movie all around!
I:15383;2370;An interesting plot line, with a few riveting twists.
I:15383;2371;It's an interesting word choice and just one of several uses of wordplay throughout the film.
I:15383;2372;"The history of the change is this: Juggling tricks were once considered a sort of enchantment
I:15383;2373;the power of the film derives largely from the novel by Christopher Priest, but Christopher Nolan serves the material well with his wonderfully moody, fragmented film style.
I:15383;2374;It isn't as elegant as the similarly premised The Illusionist, but it is a good deal more complex.
I:15383;2375;But in the course of the film the word does double duty and more, growing in application until life, love, class, and ambition have build up the term's storied meaning.
I:15383;2376;the theme of curiosity and fascination (even in spite of knowing) is emphasized with questions raised by the story.
I:15383;2377;It is a basic precept of magic .
I:15383;2378;Indeed, of all the arts, magic may be the best suited to imitating nature, as it produces an innocent sense of wonder by `featuring' the invisible.
I:15383;2379;"This is important in regard to ""the Prestige"" because the film makes a point of showing all its elements quite clearly, yet still produces wonder at its implications."
I:15383;2380;"Appropriately, the name of the central trick is, ""The Transported Man."
I:15383;2381;"Hugh Jackman's character is upset upon first seeing Christian Bale's perfect trick ""The Transported Man,"" because he thinks the trick is in the wrong hands."
I:15383;2382;He says at one point that he doesn't care about his wife, only the prestige, but in this story the effect of enchantment is equated with romantic love.
I:15383;2383;"For the living Jackman, the one born of Tesla's machine, the knowledge of ""life's misery"" and that ""the earth is solid"" gradually dispels the short."
I:15383;2384;a philosophically complex and engaging mystery, though it might work just as well or better as a stage production.
I:15383;2385;You've seen these fine actors in great films before.
I:15383;2386;won this award also) by Christopher Priest, one of the finest authors in the world today, whose books defy categorisation.
I:15383;2387;These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect.
I:15383;2388;if you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out.
I:15383;2389;One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list.
I:15383;2390;I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse.
I:15383;2391;In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.
I:15383;2392;the Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises.
I:15383;2393;the two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick.
I:15383;2394;Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other.
I:15383;2395;We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price.
I:15383;2396;He calls it The Transported Man.
I:15383;2397;Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career.
I:15383;2398;Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless.
I:15383;2399;Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.
I:15383;2400;There's always something important happening on the screen.
I:15383;2401;What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value.
I:15383;2402;On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is.
I:15383;2403;The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed.
I:15383;2404;Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts.
I:15383;2405;I was completely hooked into this film right from the start.
I:15383;2406;The plot twists and turns kept me glued to me seat and the screen.
I:15383;2407;notch by all involved (especially David Bowie's supporting role), the writing was incredibly clever, and the direction was smooth and sure.
I:15383;2408;Bale's character is tender in his family scenes and that actually is disturbing as we don't see him truly hurt or sorry for his part in his partner's wife's death.
I:15383;2409;It is truly one of the best films of 2006 and should have been honored with a Best Picture nod.
I:15383;2410;"This film may not be to everyone's liking, but I loved it and highly recommend it along withThe Illusionistand equally well done film about magic that went kind of unnoticed as ""The Prestige"" was a more splashy film at the time."
I:15383;2411;Great movie, has you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
I:15383;2412;Very interesting SciFi movie with one of the creepy.
I:15383;2413;ist I got you good vengeance schemes.
I:15383;2414;this movie is very good.
I:15383;2415;the prestige is definitely better than The Illusionist.
I:15383;2416;The Prestige is a great movie that keeps you thinking and entertained every minute.
I:15383;2417;It has so many twists and turns, it truly is a magician's movie .
I:15383;2418;I had to watch it twice, it is quite complex, well thought.
I:15383;2419;david Bowie does a guest appearance as Tesla, which is a very interesting part of the movie.
I:15383;2420;Scarlet Johannsen is lovely to watch, and portrays her character as the beautiful assistant flawlessly.
I:15383;2421;The scenes of London are true to form for the turn of the century, including the lighting, costumes, and overall feeling of the city.
I:15383;2422;i highly recommend this movie, great entertainment and challenging for the mind.
I:15383;2423;Each time you watch it, you catch new things you had never seen before!
I:15383;2424;It is filled with mystery, suspense, and of course.
I:15383;2425;This movie takes some thinking to understand and appreciate, but once you understand everything.
I:15383;2426;it might be one of the best movies you ever watch.
I:15383;2427;My whole family enjoyed watching together .
I:15383;2428;you'll have to watch it for yourself.
I:15383;2429;Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both great in this movie as is Michael Caine.
I:15383;2430;In the movie, The Prestige, you learn a magician provides the audience with three acts.
I:15383;2431;(You must keep these in mind as you're watching the entire movie because it's the whole bases of what's going to happen.
I:15383;2432;the three acts are:The pledge: The performer shows you something ordinaryThe turn: The ordinary does something extraordinary.
I:15383;2433;I watched The Illusionist and liked that so I bought this when it was released.
I:15383;2434;I liked the Illusionist better and not because it's a 'chick' flick because I don't go for those.
I:15383;2435;It is good enough to give it another chance though so I will watch it again and hope I will enjoy it more.
I:15383;2436;bent on destroying each others' careers and, ultimately, their lives.
I:15383;2437;"There are many twists and turns in the plot, but each one is pretty easy to figure out before the ""prestige"" is revealed."
I:15383;2438;"despite its implausibility and opaque ""twists,"" it's an enjoyable film."
I:15383;2439;The Prestige is the better of the two sister films.
I:15383;2440;This film is a smart, creative, original, and beautifully crafted masterpiece.
I:15383;2441;the script itself is largely complex at times.
I:15383;2442;This makes The Prestige very fun to watch over and over(as MANY have noted).
I:15383;2443;I have watched the film a few times and I still have to think about the events that are going on and what is really happening within them.
I:15383;2444;It is refreshing to see a movie that can truly challenge ones mind at times.
I:15383;2445;It's astonishing how good this script is.
I:15383;2446;the acting is wonderful here.
I:15383;2447;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale have really proven themselves that they are very talented.
I:15383;2448;"Bale is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood today
I:15383;2449;His performance surprised me because of how good it was.
I:15383;2450;It is cool how at first the viewer almost roots for his character, but as time goes on that changes.
I:15383;2451;"Michael Caine is always amazing
I:15383;2452;Certainly wasn't too hard to look at either!Nolan's directing is so incredible here.
I:15383;2453;The man puts his heart in his art and it shows 100%.
I:15383;2454;The way the film is shot is also almost hard to describe because it is absolutely beautiful in every sense of the word.
I:15383;2455;The lighting and photography go beyond incredible.
I:15383;2456;The two work together perfectly creating the slightly dark mood for the film and it works great.
I:15383;2457;It really grows on you and takes some time for it to fully settle in.
I:15383;2458;It is a complex film filled with mystery, rage, rivalry, and emotion.
I:15383;2459;The film keeps a steady perfect pace and never becomes boring.
I:15383;2460;It is a gorgeous piece of art.
I:15383;2461;A near perfect film that is highly recommended.
I:15383;2462;This film was very enjoyable and added a pleasurable dimension to my chore time.
I:15383;2463;I absolutely loved this movie!
I:15383;2464;"The Prestige throws you many curve balls and you always have to ""watch the hand that's doing the tricks""."
I:15383;2465;but trust me it ALL comes together in the end and when it does, it's BRILLIANT!
I:15383;2466;Oh, this was a really good film.
I:15383;2467;It starts with a professional rivalary between two magicians.
I:15383;2468;It forces the other magician into an obsessive quest to figure out how the trick is done.
I:15383;2469;anybody who likes this movie is easy to please.
I:15383;2470;The Prestige has two of the greatest actors alive, along with the greatest director of our time as well.
I:15383;2471;The story will leave you speechless.
I:15383;2472;It will leave you questioning everything you have thought you knew about this movie.
I:15383;2473;The story is amazingly written in style.
I:15383;2474;The actors play their roles very well.
I:15383;2475;And the mystery will shock you at the very end.
I:15383;2476;The audio, meanwhile, is subdued but wonderfully so.
I:15383;2477;The uncompressed surround is terrific.
I:15383;2478;Now that the tech specs are out of the way, onto the bulk:Ever since Christopher Nolan's little seen movie entitled Following, I knew we had a director worth keeping an eye on.
I:15383;2479;pretty much par for the course.
I:15383;2480;nolan has crafted a fine story that runs like a trainwreck.
I:15383;2481;the other day, it was playing on a movie channel and I managed to catch it just as the opening credits were running.
I:15383;2482;I'll just watch a little bit of it, I thought and ended up staying for the entire runtime.
I:15383;2483;I bring this up because what I find so thrilling and interesting about The Nolans is just how well.
I:15383;2484;The continual moving back and forth in time is nothing new to them (Following, Memento), but the way it's constructed, perfectly, as the three acts of a magic trick is pure.
I:15383;2485;and watching through it a second time illuminated just how early they set up the events.
I:15383;2486;"in the end, the final lines speak volumes: ""Now you're looking for the secret."
I:15383;2487;While I find the Illusionist a better movie than The Prestige, both are good movies well worth having.
I:15383;2488;I found this movie a bit hard to follow as you really have to pay attention.
I:15383;2489;Directed by Christopher Nolan, it includes great story telling, great characters, great twists.
I:15383;2490;See if you can figure it out as it quickly moves.
I:15383;2491;There is a twist at the end that I will not give away.
I:15383;2492;David Bowie's acting is actually impressive.
I:15383;2493;The acting in this movie is excellent and so is the film direction.
I:15383;2494;got it right away couldn't wait to see it.
I:15383;2495;Its a very good movie with a lot of twist and turns, the Prestige is well worth the price!
I:15383;2496;A really intriguing film up until the final payoff.
I:15383;2497;Great cast (especially the treat of David Bowie) that ultimately almost redeems the end game plot conceit.
I:15383;2498;"act Two: The TurnWritten by brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan and directed by Christopher (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Insomnia""), ""The Prestige"" presents a complicated, involving tale of two competing magicians who are seeking to become the best in their field."
I:15383;2499;While the film is beautiful, technically outstanding and very interesting, this cold heartedness makes it way into the story, robbing the film of some emotion and some of its power.
I:15383;2500;"How many filmmakers are accomplished enough to create a film like ""Memento"" as their second film?"
I:15383;2501;"Then to follow that with ""Insomnia"" and ""Batman Begins"", well, we have a talent on our hands."
I:15383;2502;He seems to enjoy exploring the dark sides of his characters, exposing them to our gaze.
I:15383;2503;This makes these characters intrinsically more interesting.
I:15383;2504;To have a hero's dark side exposed gives us more to think about and to ponder, making them more fully developed.
I:15383;2505;"in ""The Prestige"", Nolan takes two of our most interesting actors and casts them in a battle against one another."
I:15383;2506;hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally good.
I:15383;2507;jackman's performance is very good.
I:15383;2508;Even though he is on a quest for revenge, he reveals his obsession in subtle doses.
I:15383;2509;bale's Borden has a couple of key similarities to his rival and one key difference.
I:15383;2510;But Borden wants to be the best Magician.
I:15383;2511;Without that emotional core, we just have a very good film.
I:15383;2512;Throughout, he takes on the role of wise old sage, teaching the other two men about the life of a magician.
I:15383;2513;The role is good, and a necessary part of the story, but Caine has certainly done more exciting work in the past.
I:15383;2514;As Angier's assistant, she becomes a pawn in the game of revenge and does a good job.
I:15383;2515;Again, nothing outstanding, but interesting.
I:15383;2516;act Three: The PrestigeBut Nolan is a true artist with his writing.
I:15383;2517;From the beginning, he weaves a complicated, intricate tale about the two magicians.
I:15383;2518;essentially, Nolan has created a jigsaw puzzle and all of the pieces fit.
I:15383;2519;He and his co. writer, his brother, have worked out every detail, to make sure it fits.
I:15383;2520;the framework of the story is also very interesting.
I:15383;2521;This method ensures that we only learn certain things when Nolan wants us to learn them.
I:15383;2522;It is a neat trick.
I:15383;2523;He has created a method of storytelling that essentially keeps us in the dark until he is ready to let us in on the secret.
I:15383;2524;this is a film with multiple revelations.
I:15383;2525;That aside, the other revelations are well performed, proving Nolan may just be a magician himself.
I:15383;2526;The Prestige is one of the most interesting to watch films I have seen this year.
I:15383;2527;well it made my money disappear.
I:15383;2528;It has a great plot and keeps u guessing till the end.
I:15383;2529;Christian Bale though, this man can act with the best of them.
I:15383;2530;Great movie, though you kinda saw the twist at the end coming up.
I:15383;2531;Nolan is one of the premier film makers we have in this day!
I:15383;2532;This is a great movie with terrific acting and a compelling plot.
I:15383;2533;Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan proves his skill as a director yet again in this thriller full of grudges, backstabbing, and magic.
I:15383;2534;way through, you realize the story might go anywhere!
I:15383;2535;It's got an amazingly twisty plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the actors all deliver amazing performances.
I:15383;2536;"This is such a good thriller, it almost makes up for how disappointing M. Night Shymilan's ""Lady in the Water"" was, because it more than fills the gap."
I:15383;2537;ray itself is a true visual feast as well.
I:15383;2538;It's got amazing black levels and color contrast that images seemed to pop off the screen, even on my crappy old 1080i.
I:15383;2539;This is definitely a great movie to play when you want to show off your Blu.
I:15383;2540;Definitely among the best that I have seen in the last few years.
I:15383;2541;A dark, twisted, visually appealing story.
I:15383;2542;I enjoyed this movie a lot, but I must admit, for most of it, I had no idea what was happening.
I:15383;2543;It was a cool story, about two rival magicians trying to discredit one another.
I:15383;2544;This film had the star power, one of Hollywood's best directors, and a unique story, but it's going to be hard for a lot of people to follow.
I:15383;2545;I've seen 1000's of films, and it's not often that I get to say, I didn't really get it, especially with something I enjoyed, but I guess Christopher Nolan will do that to ya!
I:15383;2546;After the release of the astoundingly good BATMAN BEGINS in 2005, it seemed clear that director Christopher Nolan's next project would be the sequel, so naturally it came as a surprise when he announced that his next project would be something else: an adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel THE PRESTIGE.
I:15383;2547;Nolan has a history of following up good projects with extraordinary projects (FOLLOWING with MEMENTO, INSOMNIA with BATMAN BEGINS).
I:15383;2548;As BATMAN BEGINS was an extraordinary project, Nolan was due for a good project.
I:15383;2549;That's what I was expecting when I saw THE PRESTIGE: a good film.
I:15383;2550;What I received was far greater than what I expected, because as it turns out, THE PRESTIGE is one of the finest films I have ever seen.
I:15383;2551;Watching THE PRESTIGE is a thoroughly captivating and ultimately haunting experience.
I:15383;2552;Fortunately, Christopher Nolan is an immensely talented director, one who is nearly cemented in my mind as one of the finest directors alive today.
I:15383;2553;He is a young master of filmmaking.
I:15383;2554;Every shot, every scene, every performance, every moment in THE PRESTIGE is flawless, and that's thanks in no small part to Nolan.
I:15383;2555;then there's the sensational cast, headed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, two very talented actors who here are at the top of their form.
I:15383;2556;screen rivalry between the two is delicious, and each character is just flawed enough so you never side with either of them for long.
I:15383;2557;david Julyan's score is very subtle, but its subtlety actually works extremely well, especially when combined with Wally Pfister's typically murky cinematography.
I:15383;2558;Lee Smith, who also edited BATMAN BEGINS, has done a similarly fast.
I:15383;2559;Advice to those planning on seeing the film: sit it through and enjoy the ride.
I:15383;2560;It's a stellar effort from everyone involved.
I:15383;2561;The film itself is the most delightful of cinematic magic tricks, the rare film that not only surpasses your expectations, but leaves you speechless.
I:15383;2562;made film, even if it is as complex as THE PRESTIGE.
I:15383;2563;Don't let its complexity put you off from seeing it, though: THE PRESTIGE is not only one of the finest films of the year, it's very probably one of the finest films I've ever seen.
I:15383;2564;I knew little about THE PRESTIGE except that it was set in Victorian London and based on a highly regarded novel about rival magicians, and that's the ideal way to see it.
I:15383;2565;the whole thing comes as one big surprise after another.
I:15383;2566;The directing, script, acting, design, etc., are all excellent, and the payoff is astonishing.
I:15383;2567;There is some very real magic going on here.
I:15383;2568;This movie blew my mind.
I:15383;2569;It was well made, well scripted, and the twist at the end made me fall in love.
I:15383;2570;In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician.
I:15383;2571;Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage.
I:15383;2572;The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted.
I:15383;2573;A movie with the power of becoming a cult classic, ''The Prestige'' is magical.
I:15383;2574;His second best film, after 'Memento'.
I:15383;2575;Christopher Nolan just seems to go from strength to strength.
I:15383;2576;The Prestige may have inexplicably missed out on a screen writing nomination at the Oscars, but it's one of the best screen adaptations in years, its excellent and ingenious script displaying confidence both in its potentially outrageous material and its audiences' intelligence, hiding all the answers in plain sight from the very first shot.
I:15383;2577;Even the dialogue pulls off the triple feat of being rich with double meanings which repay repeat viewing, right for each scene it appears in and, far from being clever just for the sake of it, naturally furthering the plot and the characters in entertaining and intriguing ways.
I:15383;2578;magic is the perfect metaphor for both storytelling and movie.
I:15383;2579;Bale has the genius but not the ability to sell his illusions to an audience.
I:15383;2580;Jackman has the showmanship but not the originality to create a truly great trick.
I:15383;2581;Still, Nolan does manage to pull off the amazing feat of getting an excellent performance out of David Bowie, through the obvious.
I:15383;2582;it technique of focussing on the singer's voice as much as his natural presence.
I:15383;2583;All interpretations seem equally valid, which is part of the fun.
I:15383;2584;And best of all, it's a delight to watch.
I:15383;2585;Well you should be because this is a movie that will keep you guessing!
I:15383;2586;Christopher Nolan has done it again, now telling the story of rival magicians at the end of the 19th century.
I:15383;2587;The cast is outstanding and draw you in almost immediately.
I:15383;2588;The special features are common for a standard edition but still manage to give some great extra time exploring this world and idea.
I:15383;2589;I've heard it said that Christopher Nolan doesn't make bad movies and this definitely helps add to that.
I:15383;2590;bent mystery will certainly love this.
I:15383;2591;It's a fun, intriguing film that is simply magical in every way.
I:15383;2592;This film is just very well made.
I:15383;2593;the use of historical characters and it's great cast really make for a story that keeps you going.
I:15383;2594;One of Chris Nolan's best films in my opinion.
I:15383;2595;"but don't worry, because the real magic of ""The Prestige"" is the seamless storytelling of Christopher Nolan, who tells the engaging story of two rival magicians of the turn."
I:15383;2596;"Supported by the wonderful cast from England and America, ""The Prestige"" is a dazzlingly entertaining film full of twists and turns."
I:15383;2597;christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are perfectly cast as Borden and Angier, formerly friends and assistants to a lesser.
I:15383;2598;"this is how I would describe the world of ""The Prestige,"" but the simple truth is the film itself is magic, or illusion, of very entertaining kind, which makes us keep guessing ""What next?"""
I:15383;2599;with a blend of real history and total fantasy.
I:15383;2600;See the character of Nicola Tesla, real.
I:15383;2601;life revolutionary inventor, played by delightfully eccentric David Bowie, and you know what I mean.
I:15383;2602;On the opposite side of him lives a contraption inventor Cutter, played by Michael Caine, whose humanity makes a great contrast to two star magicians.
I:15383;2603;"As such ""The Prestige"" is successful."
I:15383;2604;The Prestige is both brilliant and entertaining.
I:15383;2605;Thanks to a clever screenplay and a beautiful photography, Christopher Nolan creates a bewitching atmosphere, and directs a compelling movie with a great ending.
I:15383;2606;Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, perfect in their roles, are just mesmeric.
I:15383;2607;The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two.
I:15383;2608;Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing.
I:15383;2609;After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2.
I:15383;2610;Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience.
I:15383;2611;'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design.
I:15383;2612;The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England.
I:15383;2613;Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel).
I:15383;2614;Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla.
I:15383;2615;Set mostly in turn of the 19th Century London, THE PRESTIGE is a magical movie about two rival magicians who become engrossed in a lifelong contest of one.
I:15383;2616;Angier and Bordon are both plants in the audience for a trick for another magician that involves tying his beautiful assistant up and lowering her into a locked huge container of water.
I:15383;2617;One is an illusionist, the other a true wizard.
I:15383;2618;So, which witch is which?I found THE PRESTIGE to be an enthralling movie that deserves multiple viewings.
I:15383;2619;Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, have done an excellent job of adapting Christopher Priest's original novel.
I:15383;2620;"The Nolan brothers also did a good job of making the characters of Algier and Borden to be both sympathetic and despicable
I:15383;2621;bale and Jackman are at the top of their game as the rival showmen, while Caine gives a solid supporting performance as the man who assists both magicians during their deepest trials.
I:15383;2622;Piper Perabo doesn't have much screen time, but I felt she was perfect as Julia.
I:15383;2623;Johansson is a very attractive woman and one of the most.
I:15383;2624;demand actresses in Hollywood right now.
I:15383;2625;The surprise performance in this film is that of David Bowie.
I:15383;2626;His performance here is the best of his acting career.
I:15383;2627;I did not recognize Bowie at all and gives a perfect performance as the man who rivaled Edison.
I:15383;2628;It's a very entertaining film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't.
I:15383;2629;It is an incredible movie at what it does do and for that it's one of the best films to be released in 2006.
I:15383;2630;Everyone else should just sit back and enjoy it.
I:15383;2631;The Prestige may have more 'meat' on it, but The Ilusionist was far more enjoyable and had a better flow.
I:15383;2632;And the actors attached this this were all a great sight to behold.
I:15383;2633;Hugh Jackman is a man obsessed.
I:15383;2634;He is looking for the perfect trick and is insanely jealous that his former friend and partner has accomplished one.
I:15383;2635;But it is definitely worth it.
I:15383;2636;A suspenseful, surprising twisting plot that was sometimes too fantastical for its own good.
I:15383;2637;Still, it was worth seeing for Michael Caine's performance.
I:15383;2638;If you like movies that keep you guessing .
I:15383;2639;especially when you don't even realize it's happening to you until the end .
I:15383;2640;Everyone should see this movie!
I:15383;2641;"A try hard provocative look at ""obsession"", where friendly competition evolves into a rivelry of one upmanship."
I:15383;2642;I thought this was a very good movie and a good blu.
I:15383;2643;It was entertaining and kept my attention.
I:15383;2644;Not only is 'The Prestige' an unpredictable movie about magicians, but the acting is well above par.
I:15383;2645;His best performance up to date.
I:15383;2646;One of the most amazing films!
I:15383;2647;I did enjoy David Bowie's understated performance as Nikola Tesla.
I:15383;2648;Then (just like it says on the cover to be prepared to do), I sat down and watched the entire thing again, with my sister this time, enjoying the delicious feeling of being in the know and finally understanding every nuance.
I:15383;2649;The Prestige is one you'll want to watch more than once because of it's surprise ending.
I:15383;2650;Good story line and full of intrigue, turns and twist.
I:15383;2651;This movie has lots of suspense and shows you how several of the great magic tricks are done.
I:15383;2652;Great acting by the two leading male stars whose competion between themselves keeps you watching.
I:15383;2653;The end was quite a surprise and it made me watch the movie several more times to try and spot the secret.
I:15383;2654;Well worth the price and it's one you can enjoy over and over again.
I:15383;2655;Since I enjoyed The Illusionist, I went into The Prestige with high expectations.
I:15383;2656;Its director is Christopher Nolan.
I:15383;2657;As each man develops an astounding illusion, the other seeks to figure out how the trick is done and then to upstage his rival with an even better illusion.
I:15383;2658;This leads to Angier's greatest illusion and his death.
I:15383;2659;the Prestige is beautiful to watch with its dark colors and the wonderful set designs that actually make you think you're in Victorian England.
I:15383;2660;The viewers are carried inside the hidden world of magicians and allowed to see how certain illusions are performed.
I:15383;2661;They accomplish this by always being the one called from the audience to assist in the trick.
I:15383;2662;I'm going to watch the film again to see if I can make better sense of what's going on.
I:15383;2663;I just want to say once again that the acting is solid and the production design excellent.
I:15383;2664;"Review: Christopher Nolan uses the skillful magician's art of misdirection in the powerful drama ""The Prestige""."
I:15383;2665;***Featuring a number of stunning performances everyone from Jackman and Bale to Michael Caine and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla one of the first men to harness the power of electricity shines in the film.
I:15383;2666;As the tagline suggest you should watch this entertaining, clever and ambitious drama very closely as there hints throughout the film that will lead clever audience members to the conclusion before it takes place.
I:15383;2667;The leap of faith necessary for the conclusion of the film will put some people off.
I:15383;2668;after all it is played as a straight ahead mystery thriller for most of the film but it's precisely this unusual twist that makes the film so vital and entertaining.
I:15383;2669;Featuring a number of powerful, confident performances, a terrific script based on a top notch novel and sharp direction by Nolan the film continues to suggest he is one of our most talented film directors working.
I:15383;2670;"As with all of Nolan's previous films ""The Prestige"" continues to demonstrate an ambitious filmmaker whose ultimate goal is to tell an involving drama that will challenge an audience's perceptions."
I:15383;2671;My wife's reaction: watch it again someday to see if it makes more sense on a second viewing.
I:15383;2672;Christopher Nolan's darkness protrudes through the scenes while Bale plays another terrific double character.
I:15383;2673;I would recommend the movie to any of my friends and it plays wonderfully on blu.
I:15383;2674;The Prestige is another interesting effort from Nolan.
I:15383;2675;The story of rival magicians has many twists, turns and surprises .
I:15383;2676;The acting by Jackman and Bale was reasonably good, and Michael Caine and David Bowie were both entertaining in their roles.
I:15383;2677;(I found Bowie's Tesla to be particularly fascinating.)
I:15383;2678;Ignore the star power in this movie, if you can.
I:15383;2679;When you get to the last scene, all you'll want is to see the rest all over again.
I:15383;2680;It really does build up, moment by moment, in an utterly logical progression that conceals its logic.
I:15383;2681;it's intense, and just scratches the surface of a rage that gentle people will not understand.
I:15383;2682;This is an interesting movie based around in london in 1900 when the age of magicians/magic show were taking of, of course culmonating with houdini in America.
I:15383;2683;A very interesting concept for the movie, and it really did keep me guessing.
I:15383;2684;I could write a long review like many of the other reviewers, but they do a good job at summerizing it.
I:15383;2685;I can just say, Chritian Bale and Hugh Jackman do spectacular jobs at playing these roles and it was Cool Seeing David Bowie in a movie again, although I kept picturing him in that Darn Labarinth outfit as he played the role of Dr. Tesla.
I:15383;2686;Well casted, great efects, and great plot.
I:15383;2687;I won't spend too much time reviewing the movie, though I will say, I absolutely love this film.
I:15383;2688;And likewise, Christian Bale turns in another masterful performance, as he continues to rise to well.
I:15383;2689;And Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as a man gripped by obsession.
I:15383;2690;ray disc provides a stunning visual and audio experience.
I:15383;2691;This is one of the best.
I:15383;2692;though the disc is a bit lacking in extras, it still deserves a solid 5 rating, as the movie itself is captivating and most importantly, very rewatchable.
I:15383;2693;It takes on new dimensions with each viewing.
I:15383;2694;The movie contains many great lessons, magic and great performances by all the actors.
I:15383;2695;the real life Nikola Tesla was a true magician.
I:15383;2696;I can recommend this film.
I:15383;2697;Put a G. strong on that shiksa, brother, and I'm a happy nonogenarian!Personally, when it comes to schtupping though I, Yasha J. Banana .
I:15383;2698;tuner, hat blocker and one.
I:15383;2699;You have a twin brother, you make sure your girlfriend knows who's who.
I:15383;2700;see, this one magician gets a machine that he uses to clone himself.
I:15383;2701;oh no, this mensch of a director keeps us guessing for the entire movie.
I:15383;2702;can you imagine if I had such a machine .
I:15383;2703;"on every street corner you'd hear people say: ""Yasha, boychick, so nice to see you."
I:15383;2704;I'd clone myself night and day and day and night .
I:15383;2705;As I said to Sophie Tucker when I asked her to stand on a mirror back in 1937: I can see it all now .
I:15383;2706;Yash, come on now, what about justice, what about .
I:15383;2707;And do you know what I say to that .
I:15383;2708;the comparison to 'The Illusionist' is naturally unavoidable.
I:15383;2709;In addition, the main characters are much easier to understand and sympathize with.
I:15383;2710;Movie is excellant and for the price its great entertainment which is what I desire in a movie.
I:15383;2711;It is an excellant movie and I love all the main characters.
I:15383;2712;A great stay in on a cold rainy night snuggle with your honey kind of movie.
I:15383;2713;So I proudly added this one to my collection.
I:15383;2714;com, I finally got to see this movie.
I:15383;2715;This guy has got a classThe movie begins with two friends (Bale and Jackman) who are kind of disciples to Michael Caine.
I:15383;2716;He does the same with much more style.
I:15383;2717;He is has done this role with precision and perfection.
I:15383;2718;His class, showmanship and his aura in general are too good.
I:15383;2719;It's the synchronization between him and Bale that's wonderful.
I:15383;2720;See this movie for these two guys and Michael Caine.
I:15383;2721;His Kate and Leopold and Someone Like You are among the nicest movies I have seen.
I:15383;2722;A darker plot, better acting, score, and direction places this film well above The Illusionist released at the same time.
I:15383;2723;I love Edward Norton but Bale is becoming a favorite of Christopher Nolan(BATMAN BEGINS).
I:15383;2724;He delivers a powerful performance along with one of Hugh Jackman's best efforts.
I:15383;2725;Hugh is searching for the perfect act while Bale has found it.
I:15383;2726;Oh yea, did I mention that the Blu Ray is picture perfect and in uncompressed 5.1 surround, the sound effects are worth the price alone.
I:15383;2727;Director Nolan continues to deliver and it will keep you guessing until the end.
I:15383;2728;Some movies are so well.
I:15383;2729;made and incredible that words often fail to describe their exact appeal without spoiling it for everyone else.
I:15383;2730;"for a basic plot summary, ""The Prestige"" sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act."
I:15383;2731;Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness.
I:15383;2732;time great primarily because of its tremendous plot.
I:15383;2733;I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject.
I:15383;2734;with which to tell this incredible story.
I:15383;2735;In terms of overall storytelling, this may just be one of the greatest ever told.
I:15383;2736;the acting is also superb, with Bale and Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Johansson stunning in her role as well.
I:15383;2737;Caine provides a moral character to the show, while also doing a voice.
I:15383;2738;over that rivals even the great Morgan Freeman.
I:15383;2739;Even all the auxiliary roles in this one are perfectly cast.
I:15383;2740;"It even rivals Nolan's ""Batman"" series in terms of dramatic intensity, which should tell you all you need to know."
I:15383;2741;movie was exciting to watch no dull let's stay awake parts.
I:15383;2742;I honestly want to, but I disagree almost entirely with their reviews.
I:15383;2743;fetched that it belongs in the realm of science fiction.
I:15383;2744;"acting/Plot:Cutter (played by Michael Caine) describes every magic trick as having three distinct parts
I:15383;2745;"It's an interesting exercise to compare the actual theatrical illusions the magicians perform in their acts with the ""tricks"" that they play on one another."
I:15383;2746;"The multiple intermingling of ""tricks"" and their parts is brilliant."
I:15383;2747;The cast does a great job of telling the story.
I:15383;2748;My eyes and ears are not finely tuned, but the picture is spectacular and the audio is incredible.
I:15383;2749;At one point I had to pause, fast forward, and catch up.
I:15383;2750;"On the cover of the case is a quote, ""You'll want to see it again the second it's over""."
I:15383;2751;great story + outstanding actors + fantastic execution of cinematography = movie that you will watch several times again again Christopher Nolan!
