id;spiegazione
1;This movie has a great premise, full of all sorts of moral and philosophical questions, but it just didn't quite do it.
2;watched this movie and I liked it a lot it was cool with all the martial atrs thank you very much
3;There were plenty of martial arts based movies with special effects before the Matrix, and every last one of them was better.
4;as for 'The One,' it's a very fun movie.
5;I really liked the same scenes played over again with the slight differences.
6;"And when the end of a movie is clearly just an excuse to have a long shot of Jet Li kicking serious butt, how can you go wrong?To sum up
7;Though 'The One' may not have the most complex plot or the best acting, 'The One' was probably one of the most enjoyable films of 2001 for me.
8;If you are a Jet Li fan, or even a fan of Martial Arts films, I'm sure you will love this movie.
9;This is propbably Jet's best American film.
10;This was a nice surprise, Jet Li is such a great martial arts expert that it was amazing to watch the fight scenes.
11;Since there are only 2 versions left of him, both versions are equally smarter, fast and strong.
12;one really knows what will happen if there is only 1 version of him left.
13;Computer technology has greatly aided the filmmaking industry.
14;Such is the case with martial arts master Jet Li's latest offering, The One.
15;dimensional travel has become possible.
16;immediately, the premise of this film catches the audience's attention.
17;Am I as unique as I believe myself to be?
18;These are all very intriguing questions and writer/director James Wong took care to ensure that none of them were addressed in this film.
19;The fact that this is an action movie, and a martial arts flick on top of that, suggests that one shouldn't expect in.
20;Both Li's wife, portrayed by the usually brilliant Carla Gugino, and Roedecker, played by the equally talented Delroy Lindo, are executed for no other reason than to motivate Li's good guy character and fuel hatred for his bad guy character, as if the audience could tell the difference.
21;The computer wizardry that allowed Jet Li to kick his own ass was actually so flawless that I forgot to be impressed by it.
22;But with this type of movie I dont think many people look for a great story line.
23;This movie has great martial arts action scenes.
24;line is interesting, but the best parts are the martial arts performances by Li and his other self .
25;There are also some interesting new visual effects, for example, with the motorcycles, but I don't want to give it away.
26;documentaries showing how they did stunts, special effects and martial arts.
27;zealous movie goers who considered Jet Li the godsend, the one who was going to deliver us from boring cinema and keep us glued to our theater seats.
28;for the most part, I still quite enjoy his films.
29;My friend and I had just seen `The Kiss of the Dragon' and we were only TOO excited for more Li action.
30;This had to be great.
31;This came out around the time when it was cool to make your movies look like video games.
32;I never understood that, and it always upset me.
33;I'd rather see Li fight other people in a better choreographed fight scene.
34;For the past ten years, Jet Li has been acting with Hollywood Movies Actors and I owns all of them and I really enjoy watching jet Li action films in Hong Kong and as well as Hollywood, Too.
35;Let me say right off the bat that I really liked Gerry's review.
36;His angle is refreshing .
37;THE ONE is the kind of movie that I, myself have dreamed of making since more than ten years ago.
38;As an aspiring filmmaker, I have no interest in merely making a movie for profit, I would also like to make great films that people can actually get something good from.
39;THE ONE is definitely a great movie, and you can't go into watching it with the mindset of a person who has no imagination.
40;Open your mind and really try to believe everything you're seeing.
41;The One is a true """"man's"""" action movie, full of fighting which is made better by the great heavy metal music selections."""
42;Other reviewers are right, there could be a better story line, but with all of that action and one of the best endings in action movie history, story line is secondary.
43;The superbit version is awesome though, and makes the movie that much better.
44;If you are going to go with a special effects movie such as this, go with superbit, it's the shiznit!!
45;But with this type of movie I dont think many people look for a great story line.
46;This film shows Jet Li at his best.
47;Playing duo roles and playing them so real is truly amazing.
48;Jason Statham is also in this one so it is a double treat for me.
49;This movie is absolutely awesome, if you like martial arts and special effects, then you have to see The One.
50;The one is jet li's best film, the fighting in this film is truely amazing, there are patches in the film where this is not much action but I thought the story entertains you enough, I dont know why so many people dont like this film, I recommend it to any one fo'sho.
51;The One is a really good action flick.
52;While this movie is nowhere near as good as Kiss of the Dragon it has some really cool special effects and is worth owning in my opinion.
53;I thought the universe jumping renegade idea was unique and the people who brought you this movie put a lot of effort in it.
54;Now back to the movie, I found it really entertaining from an action junkie's point of view.
55;It's a thrill watching Jet handcuff half a dozen Los Angeles Sheriff's officers like he was knitting a sweater.
56;The finally fight is awesome with the good versus evil Jet Li's.
57;He moves so effortlessly that it makes sense that he's not very tall and not very muscular.
58;He looks great in this movie.
59;Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo as Multiuniverse policemen was also a nice touch.
60;Statham did a pretty decent job with the American accent and Jet spoke more words in English than his previous American movies.
61;Their relationship adds a human side to this story, but I thought it could have been more physical and she could have played a bigger role.
62;Whenever the script calls for a love interest, the relationship is presented in a subtle way, but Jet's face is so expressive that maybe that's all that is needed.
63;With this movie, I've difinetly became a solid Jet Li fan.
64;The direction and effects were superb.
65;the script was humerous and intricate enough to hold some attention.
66;Well, I liked this movie only becouse of the special effects.
67;But it has found a place in my heart, and I'll tell you why.
68;Now imagine those movies that you formed grade.
69;And that's the big break I cut for it.
70;friendly, and I think it'll serve some burgeoning movie fans well in their formative years (bad action movies are a necessity to growing boys, you know).
71;and besides that distant sense of nostalgia it gives me, it's also got some pretty darn funny accidental humor (which always works to the credit of these kinds of movies).
72;natured to look that malevolent).
73;"sandwich"" death that could very well be the stuff of legend."
74;And I hope someday I'll have a son who makes a fool of himself showing off his The One.
75;When I first saw `The One' on VHS is was introduced with its own trailer.
76;`The One' is an interesting concept which combines everything we loved about `The Terminator', `Time Cop,' `The Matrix,' `Sliders' and more.
77;Just like `Sliders' technology has made it possible to travel between alternate universes.
78;fi and Jet Li as both hero and villain is intriguing.
79;`The One' does have some good sci.
80;And that, my friends, is everything good and interesting about this movie.
81;I was touched by the honest romance between Li and Carla Gugino, but that's all.
82;This film will make you wonder why he is a star in the first place.
83;This movie does have very good fighting action and keeps you very entertained while watching it.
84;I wanted to like this movie, I really did.
85;The action is great, and the special effects look amazing, but the story seemed to be lacking.
86;Besides some decent special effects and a good musical score.
87;the film has few redeeming qualities.
88;the last survivng version of Li is Los Angeles sheriff's deputy, Gabe Law, who also has become more powerful.
89;This movie has many special effects that you can see one more time, good argument, good sounds, good scenarios, just look it and probe it.
90;The story line is simple .
91;good vs. evil, so what really carries this movie are the Matrix.
92;esque special effects and, more than anything, the martial arts.
93;This is what makes this film a treat for martial arts enthusiasts.
94;Jet Li also introduces himself as great master of those styles.
95;There are few special effects that I liked, like to make a very fast fight scene and to show it in slow motion.
96;It looks much more persuasive this way, but Jet Li is brilliant martial artist and he does not need special effects to impress.
97;"Not only do you have Jet Li doing his martial arts thing, which he does better than anyone else working in movies today, but he finally faces a worthy opponent (himself)
98;Best of all, though, we get to see Jet Li portray a bad guy, and that is something you just don't want to miss.
99;Lawless (the bad Jet Li) makes a spectacular escape from the universe cops and comes after the one remaining version of himself out there, Gabe Law (the good Jet Li).
100;Gabe has naturally been gaining in power and strength himself all this time, and this fact plus his martial arts background makes Gabe a force to be reckoned with.
101;The movie builds to the ultimate confrontation between these two selves, a nice twist on the struggle between good and evil.
102;i, for the most part, like my martial arts displays realistic and natural"
103;Consider that job done in The One.
104;There are a couple of scenes in which the animation does not look real for a moment or two, but one can easily overlook this because the things that the souped up version of Jet Li does pretty much rock the house.
105;type figures, and another look at all of the faces of Jet Li that go to form the funniest part of the movie .
106;as Lawless' crimes are detailed, we are shown photos of all the incredibly diverse and oftentimes hilarious guises of Jet Li's character across the multiverse.
107;i think The One is a fantastic, action.
108;"Just accept the premise of the whole multiverse idea
109;I am very happy with the like new condition of the product and the speed in which it was sent to me.
110;if you want an awesome fighting movie, the one is for you.
111;eight scene selections, and a widescreen theatrical trailer.
112;English and French are the spoken language options, with English , French,Chinese, Korean, and Thai for subtitles.
113;image:I give it 7 stars out of 10.
114;extras:I give it 6 stars out of 10.
115;jet Li does a passable job of acting, but the real gem of this is the fight sequences, which are beautiful to watch.
116;It seems to me that a great deal of care and thought went into the choreography of these parts, and the overall result is very well done.
117;If you like to watch Jet Li movies then this is a movie that you people should go and watch.
118;cool martial arts moves, but it succeeds in giving you an exciting ride if you want it to.
119;He's a great guy and I seriously think he's the modern day Bruce Lee.
120;He'll kick your ass if you cross the line and interfere with his moral obligations.
121;It's a great popcorn flick and will leave your mouth open in awe and excitement, but that depends if you resent the all.
122;The movie has plenty of weak spots, notably the mostly lame humor and stiff acting of most (although I don't find that Li's acting was bad at all), but the idea behind it is solid as far as sci.
123;The selling point, of course, is the fighting.
124;Unlike many movies you actually get to see something interesting: Jet Li uses Bagua Zhang, a form of internal martial arts from the mid.1800s.
125;I rate this movie 4 stars.
126;The film's biggest problem is Jet Li himself, who plays a plethora of characters, but can't manage a single worthy performance as any of them.
127;the good news is, Li looks right at home with the material.
128;The One does succeed in inciting us to question the lucidity and good judgment of its characters and writers, whose efforts never rise above juvenile.
129;Martial arts aficionados will undoubtedly embrace the film with such praiseful compliments as """"breathtaking"""" and """"eye."""
130;happily, The One delivers in much grander style than any Li film since Lethal Weapon 4.
131;Is it a cinematic masterpiece?
132;Is it an emotional tour de force?
133;But is it enjoyable, and does it deliver excitement and entertainment?
134;But director James Wong (Final Destination) is imaginative enough that the PG.13's usual restrictions aren't a big hurdle for him.
135;, the whole package is delivered with enough sense of fun to make you suspend disbelief.
136;Carla Gugino doesn't exactly get the deepest role here, but she's very likeable and provides Li with his first believable love interest, and Delroy Lindo just steals the show with a hilarious, surprising dual.
137;His second entrance is easily the funniest moment in the film.
138;And Jason Statham manages to make us forget those awful Guy Ritchie movies from which he came.
139;the script moves along briskly and the pacing is tight, the fight sequences very well staged and shot, with extra marks going to the slam.
140;Sure, some of the techniques look similar to The Matrix, but they're still fun to watch.
141;Still, if you're an action fan, you would probably enjoy The One.
142;Talking about decent plot in this movie is like talking about water on the moon.
143;Every time he has an emotion, it's the same expression .
144;I will say that the catch.22 in the movie was okay, but naturally they copped out with it in the end.
145;For a Jet Li movie, The One is most original, blending martial arts with a sci.
146;"The idea is great, and you may fall in love with ""the idea"" more than the movie itself."
147;the most memorable element of the film is that there are 2 Jet Li's.
148;the originality of this movie, the martial arts, and the good Jet Li vs bad Jet Li still give this movie a 4 stars.
149;I absoultely loved this movie when it first came out, because I thought oh who cool this is for Jet Li.
150;I love his style, the manner in which he looks into the camera, and plays his foe.
151;Go watch Twin Warriors, which is possibly the best Jet Li film ever.
152;Another good one is Jet Li's Fist of Legend.
153;The One features an extremely silly, but also very intriguing premise.
154;It's just that the movie ignores the concept in favor of big fight scenes.
155;the One does feature a few good actors, particularly Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham, both of whom are fine here, though I would have liked to have seen Statham kick a little more butt.
156;He's definitely got the makings of a top.
157;notch action icon, certainly moreso than the overrated Vin Diesel.
158;But at least we can always watch The Transporter for that (which is, by the way, a far more entertaining action thriller).
159;There are a couple of enjoyable moments, including a scene where Li handcuffs some cops together and to a chair, but there's too much CGI at work, not enough thrills, and certainly not enough brains to pull this premise off.
160;Jet Li's best American film to date is still Kiss of the Dragon, see that one instead.
161;For great Jet Li, go back to the Once Upon a Time in China series.
162;the plot is one seen before, with the world as a kind of multi.
163;There are an infinite number of parallel universes, and in each one there is one of us.
164;amazing effects, like Li's encounter with the motorcycle cops or his Matrix.
165;But it is his martial arts ability which makes this flick.
166;The movies is almost a 90 minute warm up for the Li vs. Li inevitable fight, and man, that sure does not disappoint!
167;This may well be the most amazing martial arts battle I have ever seen.
168;Not the most thoughtful film ever, but for fans of the martial arts genre, it is sure sufficient to be entertaining.
169;Jet Li is awesome in The One.
170;the action is decent, but hey whatever.
171;action fans, pick this up as soon as possible!
172;If you like those blockbuster movies, then you'll love this one.
173;Jamed packed with excitement and action, Jet Li takes you on a time traveling journey through good and evil.
174;For the moment you'll be seeing doubles.
175;This is a very good movie.
176;As one would expect from any Corey Yuen film, the action is superbly choreographed.
177;Jet Li is a personable star with amazing martial arts skills.
178;The special effects were fantastic and the movie in general, was entertaining and a lot of fun.
179;There seems to be a real inconsistency with the abilities of the characters.
180;It's fun and I recommend it to people.
181;But I would love to see some of those deleted scenes.
182;You can dodge bullets, become ultra smart, ultra strong.
183;So is THE One's plan until he meets his last version, and since both THE One and The One are both on equal power, this One might be a bit harder to kill.
184;Add a young Jason Statham, and you got a great popcorn flick.
185;The fight sceans are (a salways when you are talking about Jte Li) excellent!!
186;i (xingyi) master meets pa.
187;i master win in that universe, thus obliterating the pa.
188;i in prison at the beginning of the film with chains in hands and feet is reminiscent of the martial arts story above because the Hsing.
189;i master was also fresh out of prison where he was similarly chained.
190;"i while the ""good Li"" was doing pa."
191;Really enjoyable for those who know about these arts.
192;And I think they did a very good job at developing a story line based on it.
193;Choreography of the fight scenes, in spite of the unrealistic moves, was a good representation of the two martial arts.
194;right now, I keep playing back the practice and fight scenes of the movie, which I would always find enjoyable.
195;It is the opinion of the writter that Mr. Li should stick to what he knows best.
196;Also Cops and robbers type movies at which he also excels.
197;Leave the futuristic and science fiction movies to others.
198;So casting aside the whole idea of Multi.
199;He is almost completely successful having killed 123 of his other selves.
200;the strong point of this film is really in the areas of fighting, action and special effects.
201;It is quite amazing to see Jet Li fighting against himself.
202;it is a great action film, but with a weak plot, so if you can live with that you will enjoy the film.
203;The concept (while fascinating) is handled in b. movie fashion with an above.
204;motion camera work to a minimum, leaving us to be entertained by Jet Li's naturally fast reflexes and superb choreography, not to mention a great soundtrack.
205;existant, the action is far from Li's best, and the comic.
206;book rendering of his fights detract from his greatest strength: real.
207;i laughed every time they brought the camera onto the 'tracking device', which they did 3 or 4 times at least.
208;The director must have thought to get the most out of that particular effect by doing so, and the result is comical at best.
209;"It had a very interesting ""plot"" and the special effects were really nice as well."
210;Although some people complain about how every fight scene was done with strings, I dont mind it at all mainly because this is a science fiction movie and the goal for the main character in this movie is to become the best, become the ONE.
211;so I felt the string touch was very appropriate.
212;"although my favorite Jet Li movies are still ones like ""The Taichi master"" and ""Fong Sai Yuk"", The ONe has also become one of my favorites now."
213;I highly recommmend it to those who like action/science fiction type movies.
214;Li's latest movie is simply incredible!
215;"I raced to the theatre to catch this one after watching the amazing ""Kiss of the Dragon""."
216;This film is packed with incredible action sequences and displays Jet Li's martial arts skills very well.
217;After seeing the Theatrical Trailor in Cinema I was very excited to watch this movie.
218;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from the edge of my seat!
219;I want a part two!
220;This movie totally rocked, man!
221;I am now a huge fan of his and not just because I weigh close to 300 pounds.
222;i am a big Jet Li fan and this movie delivers what I thought that it would.
223;Great special effects and awesome martial arts fights.
224;the plot is very original and the martial art fights are great.
225;It isn't the best Jet Li movie but it's still a good movie.
226;The end's great and the fights are great fun.
227;he's pretty much great in everything he's in, so thats a given.
228;This film uses a premise that is really cool.
229;Jet Li is an interesting actor.
230;I did't really take him seriously until I saw Kiss of the Dragon.
231;On the other hand, this movie boasts some of the best action sequence special effects ever, like when he kicks 4 cops in the air before the first one hits the ground.
232;It is his third good film in America since Lethal Weapon 4.
233;I liked how they are now incorporating love interests in his movies and this one plays it off very purely.
234;the reason i give this film four stars is simple,the battle between the good Li and the bad Li near the end is great,the specal effects were pretty darn good and the very last scene was really cool.
235;In The One with Jet Li, there is a whole lotta action.
236;The way that the music in some segments corresponds with the action is amazing.
237;Jet Li is truly talented in this film with his speed and power.
238;jet Li is a good fighter.
239;This movie wastes Jet Li's otherwise wonderful talents.
240;I'm not a fan of Jet Li per se, but I do like good action.
241;"Promote Jet Li since he's at a high point, Promote ""the next matrix"" style effects, and to promote ""Disturbed's"" new album."
242;There is plenty of action and very well choreographed fighting scenes, and the story is quite decent, but the music choice is what killed it.
243;Once I was able to see it, I thought it was a very good movie, but not perfect.
244;The concept of a multiverse makes for good sci.
245;fi and this movie was definately interesting to me.
246;In another universe he is Yu Law, a man obsessed with power.
247;It may be to some people but watching it clears a lot up.
248;The movie is loaded with great fight scenes and special effects that make for a visual treat.
249;Just be patient because it does get better, especially with the fight between Gabe and Yu Law.
250;fi fan you may enjoy this movie.
251;If you just want to see a good action movie with awesome special effects, check this one out.
252;But I really enjoyed it, enough so to give it 4 stars.
253;This movie has a great concept and it has Jet Li.
254;How in the world could it have turned out so badly?The concept is a pretty cool one.
255;It's possible for people in one universe to access the others via wormholes.
256;The two that are left, sharing as they do the energy formerly parcelled out among all 125, are now really really fast and really really strong.
257;"But with a good screenplay and the right production, it could have been a good movie
258;The guy is amazing to watch.
259;it's one big Duhh after another.
260;there's more to a successful SF/cyberthriller than cool special effects, even if they _are_ copied from John Gaeta.
261;This is a realy good movie and don't lisson to the people saying that the movie was realy ZZZzzz , because it's not like that .
262;It's worth the money that you might be spending on it .
263;there are lots of good things about this movie, not least being the wonderful marshall arts choerography or the tantalising thought of Jet Li in action against himself!
264;Jet Li once again demonstrates that the martial arts genre has more to offer than the clownish antics of Jackie Chan, and that there is a more artistic and darker side to it.
265;His most recent roles suggest that Li will become an even bigger star as he certainly has a greater breadth than Chan.
266;There are some contradictions within the plot certainly.
267;all in all a pretty good movie, kept the attention and was entertaining and fun to watch.
268;Good production and good camera work.
269;The reason is that they had a great premise and a great action star, but they let the air go out of the movie somewhere near the beginning.
270;now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, especially the spec ops like fire fights and the nicely done super human abilities that Jet had.
271;Still I blame whoever for allowing the movie to rest soley on those aspects and never exploring the full potential of an Ultimate ONE.
272;That is, I can't do it, but they could have accomplished soooooooo much more with this movie.
273;still I enjoyed it at the $1 flick and I'd see it again if I was in an airplane on my way somewhere.
274;So if you like Jet Li, action, and want an escape this does all of that.
275;But if you are super creative and think you're going to get a mixture of creativity and action.
276;The idea in this movie is outstanding.
277;this is a movie worth seeing.
278;I realize now that I should have and I will be doing that with future orders.
279;There definitely needs to be more time for returning products.
280;the movie still deserves 3 stars because it is straight forward.
281;You are told what the problem is and you are able to witness how the problem is handled.
282;Therefore, the movie deserves medium credit for staying in its boundaries.
283;so, if you want to give your philisophical mind a rest, give """"The One"""" a shot."""
284;This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen.
285;The plot is fine and does make sense if you have an open mind.
286;Humanity now has the technology to travel between them.
287;By doing this, he gains the strength and intelligence of all the versions of himself that he kills.
288;this is a really good movie.
289;It combines action, martial arts, and Sci.
290;Jet Li and Jason Statham always make a good pair.
291;The One is a pretty unique movie, and is definitely worth watching.
292;The special effects were good.
293;There were actually alot of funny parts in the movie to me.
294;The last fight scene at the end was the best of the movie that was hype.
295;but the movie overall was really cool.
296;If you like the matrix you'll be sure to like the one.
297;the One was overall a pretty good movie, with lots of interesting ideas, but it had some faults as well.
298;What I liked best about it was the fact that The One was original, as far as the setting goes.
299;Other high points included the special effects, camera angles, and stunts.
300;For instance, most of the movie was fight scenes, which got old after a while.
301;For that, I give it seven stars.
302;If you like action movies with intense and good martial arts sequences, then you'll love this movie.
303;To conclude, I say that The One was an original movie that is worth taking some time to see.
304;Jet Li is the best martial artist there is, and The One shows you exactly why i think so.
305;This is the best Jet Li movie out right now, in fact its my favorite action movie.
306;with great effects and choreography.
307;What a treat to martial artists and action fans.
308;This is an excellent movie for anyone to watch over the age of 16.
309;His marital arts and acting is great in this movie.
310;I've seen his great real action in many other HongKong movies, and also known he was one fo the yngest champ in a martial art contest in China.
311;If you wanna see nice SF, then you'll be satisfied with this movie.
312;"While ""The One"" is not a film that gives me a headache from thinking too much, it is a lot of fun."
313;The commentary delves into important issues like Jet Li's hair.
314;"Jason Statham who recently starred in ""The Transporter"" does a great job."
315;"In addition to these and ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Barrel,"" he's developing a nice body of work."
316;Delroy Lindo does a nice job trying to catch Jet.
317;This is definitely for fans of the action genre who like interesting fight sequences.
318;The ending sequence with sparks flying in the factory was also beautifully photographed in addition to being a great fight.
319;Don't expect the world, but enjoy the alternate universe!
320;I bought this as a gift for my daughters boyfriend for christmas.
321;He really liked it and had no problems with the disk.
322;It came in a very timely manner
323;This is the best Jet Li movie so far.
324;If you liked the Matrix, you will like this.
325;The special effects are fantastic.
326;The martial arts of Jet Li are better than any previous actors.
327;"The one reason to see ""The One"" is for the fight scenes, which are done considerably well, looking sleek and smooth."
328;But the action is cool.
329;Kill all of them, and you become the one.
330;arts movies will find much to be entertained by.
331;wonderful special effects then you'll love this movie.
332;The One was beautifully done and the idea is great.
333;I love Kung Fu movies and I love Sci Fi.
334;I disagree, I think Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon are two of his best.
335;I think Jet Li is the best action hero we have.
336;The One was indeed a good movie but not great as many said it would be!
337;those were actually the only parts that brought the movie down, but other than that it is a good movie, lots of action .
338;Give this one a wide berth.
339;I really enjoyed this movie.
340;it had very good special effects and a nice story.
341;i mean, the fight scenes were great, visual effects are excellent.
342;i speaccially liked Carla Cugino's(Spy kids) performance.
343;she's so pretty and talented.
344;mama mia!Also Delroy Lindo was great.
345;can you imagine what is going to be his faith?
346;I'll level with you: after seeing the too.
347;This movie is able to combine the sci.
348;fi, action, and martial arts genres into one movie,and this is done outstandingly well, especially considering it only lasts 81 minutes.
349;even the fight scenes aren't entertaining.
350;though the end battle with Li and Li is great and thats what boasts it up to a two star rating.
351;I seem to recall this was a pretty good sci.
352;"i generally enjoy Jet Li's work, even if he does have a few weird or ""dark"" roles."
353;It seems every action hero has to eventually face himself.
354;The plot is complex: 125 parallel dimensions exist.
355;Seeing Jet grab two motorcycles, one in each hand, and smash a man to death with them is a thrill.
356;That's the best part of the movie.
357;this is a rare instance of a script being better than the actor can handle.
358;more than most people display in a year.
359;But that's okay, what he does is some amazing martial arts, demonstrates really cool special effects, and provides a funky plotline that inspired me enough to want to run a mini.
360;That's the highest compliment I can give any movie.
361;seen many times love it fighting scenes are great totaly great film everyone should see this movie great great fils
362;To me, this is the best thing Jet Li has done!
363;The story is great and original!
364;this is a great sci fi action martial arts film that you should really enjoy and find unlike any other film!
365;Well I'm happy to say I was wrong, its Jet Li's most innovative, and entertaining movie to date and I've seen a few.
366;His acting has really improved along with his english, the soundtrack is once again strong ala Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, thetechnical and special effects are outstanding (I especially enjoyed the afterworld created for the Bad One)and the bonus features are a must see, only then will anyone begin to fully appreciate just how special this move is.
367;One of the best new movies you will enjoy, spectacular action as good as The Matrix.
368;Very good tricks and special effects.
369;The talent just keeps getting better and better.
370;"Action lovers should love Jet Li's ""The One"" with its awesome action sequences, Matrix."
371;fi, the film works on the premise that there are multiple universes out there and in each universe we all have counterparts.
372;THE COOL THINGS:Like most Jet Li films, the action and effects drive this film.
373;Action fans will love the many Matrix.
374;The movie ending Jet Li vs. Jet Li battle.
375;Feature length commentary: Always insightful.2.
376;Multiverse: AWESOME 18 minute feature detailing how the CGI.
377;enhanced action sequences were filmed.4.
378;Many Faces of Jet Li: Cool 2 minute feature showing the various Jet Li's of the multiverse.6.
379;Filmographies for: James Wang (director), Jet Li, Carla Gugino, Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo.8.
380;decent story you can't go wrong with this flick.
381;That would have made the story much more interesting, provided a stronger attachment to the main characters, and giving more of a buildup and resolution.
382;"Instead, I recommend ""Kiss of the Dragon"", which was only marginally better plot."
383;wise, but contained many superb action scenes.
384;If you love science and the possibility of life in other worlds, you will certainly appreciate this film.
385;The One is a ground.
386;breaking special effects extravaganza with twice the explosive action, twice the gravity.
387;defying martial arts, and twice the Jet Li!
388;"But for Yulaw to become ""the one"", he will have to face his ultimate challenge yet."
389;The One is the most action.
390;"packed, most entertaining Jet Li movie ever made since ""Romeo Must Die"", ""Lethal Weapon 4"", and ""Kiss of the Dragon""!"
391;i enjoyed the Wu Tang Clan's release of Yuen Woo Ping's early masterpiece `Shaolin Drunkard' much better.
392;I thought this was the best overall Jet Li movie since he started making movies in the US.
393;At first, The One seemed to be a pretty good movie.
394;It had Jet Li in it and it had awesome special effects.
395;they were tryin to change the ways of Hollywood by making a open ended ending and its good that they tried.
396;they messed this movie up so much!
397;i thought it was pretty good.
398;As a Jet Li fan, I really liked this movie.
399;"I enjoyed this movie not this time as much as the ""KISS OF DRAGON"" or the ""ROMEO MUST DIE"" for the really cool karate movements of Jet Li, including the adventure of the film."
400;But, what really impressed me was the introduction of the pioneering idea of multi.
401;dimensional universes and time by the director James Wong.
402;This is enough to make everybody with sense of humor to watch this movie.
403;and shootouts and sweet Matrix.
404;Excellent film, it's Highlander meets the Matrix.
405;I am a fan of Jet Li and his movies.
406;Excellent fight scenes and a great plot.
407;I liked this movie very much.
408;It's definitely one(pardon the pun,again) of the best in my opinion.
409;Every once in a while someone films a movie that really does have a new take on its genre.
410;The pacing is excellent, the plotline fascinating (the bad guy's being chased by a couple of dimensional cops who have an additional concern beyond the fact that this guy's committing multiple homicides: according to some dimensional theory, if he succeeds in eliminating all the others, it will cause a cataclysm), and the action is simply top.
411;the ending is surprising, and extremely cool.
412;If action's your thing, this one will deliver.
413;Jet Li and Statham are terrific together in this multi.
414;The CGI effects are good and it has good story.
415;This wasnt very a good film.
416;"the soundtrack is awesome, with songs like
417;So watch this with an open mind and dont expect 2 much.
418;Like a preceding film Highlander, this film has a similar theme.
419;he is a former police officer of the Multiverse Authority who has discovered that by killing each of his alternate selves, he becomes faster, smarter and more powerful.
420;one, including Yulaw himself has any idea.
421;Thanks to an exploding rodent (!)
422;It turns out that each surviving alternate gets equally stronger as the power is equally redistributed after each death.
423;A full on hand to hand fight of Jet Li vs Jet Li, as opposed to all the skirmishes where the two didn't really connect up to that point.
424;The fight is extraordinary but it takes its time getting there.
425;this is one of those films that it pays not to think too hard about.
426;Like I said, best not to think of these things too much.
427;Yulaw's fate at the end of the film was intriguing though and it would be intriguing to have seen where that led.
428;They have made some great films in Hong Kong which are worth chasing down (Once upon a Time in China and Police Story 3:Supercop) and the makers of their American films should learn more from them.
429;Well known fight choreographer Corey Yuen helped create the fights in this film.
430;It's well worth seeing these to get an insight into the complexities of movies that use a lot of special effects.
431;Will Yulaw become King of the Hill?Not really a very successful as a film but worth a look for the excellent fight at the end and 3 very good features about the making of the film.
432;The movie in my opinion has one of the best opening scenes I've seen for an action movie.
433;style effects to achieve some of the fights.
434;the main soundtrack of the movie is composed by Hans Zimmer who has quite a fine reputation for doing action movie soundtracks (Black Rain, The Rock, etc).
435;The plot of the movie is original and has a lot of potential going for it.
436;Better yet, we don't know who wins, and later on it turns out that Yulaw was actually killed by the monk, but the monk himself, after beating Yulaw and 'absorbing' some of his powers and knowledge, turns to evil himself and decides to masquerade as Yulaw.
437;The likes of which had the feel of a USA network world premier.
438;Give me """"Once upon a time in China"""" any day."""
439;Bagua is used to portray the good Jet Li, Gabe Law's philosophy that life should be like a balanced circle.
440;if you are familiar with any of the major Chinese internal martial arts, you will find this film to be most pleasurable.
441;Specifically, Jet Li fighting himself by virtue of digital effects.
442;If that's what you're into, fine.
443;"dimensional chase movie and all the fun that implies, don't waste your time: most of this unfolds in L. a. And despite its similar concept, ""The One"" delivers none of the eerie mood, complex characters and philosophical musings that distinguished ""The Matrix"", which is surprising considering director James Wong and his co. writer and producer Glen Morgan both worked on the high."
444;"minded ""X. files"" and the surprisingly thoughtful ""Final Destination"" before this."
445;Oh come now, don't worry, Jet Li is always at his best and this one proves it.
446;The special features catch Jet Li playing dress up for the movie and boy does this one rock!
447;the special features are awesome along with movie itself.
448;Popular rock songs are played during some of the really fast paced action scenes.
449;This makes the movie even more entertaining.
450;Fortunately, it is really a great movie.
451;It has a lot of replay value.
452;"Would it make this you stronger, faster, smarter, with abilities well beyond normal ""men?"""
453;Sometimes his moves range in the realms of normal mean, and sometimes his moves go well beyond that.
454;In movies like Legend of the Swordsman and Black Mask, he's shown us that he can not only do the amazing, but that he can do it convincingly.
455;Some hinted that it would undo everything, too, and some hinted that it would perhaps make that one be able to accomplish everything.
456;And that motivation, the becoming of something almost godlike, was what drove the killing forward.
457;I liked that, and I liked the fact that each killing made Jet Li more efficient as the story progressed.
458;Though he is experiencing bigger things there, true fans know him through his films made in Hong Kong, and they know they are right.
459;"Like his previous film ""Final Destination,"" the film is built upon one unique premise, and here we are told in the opening that the universe is in reality a muti."
460;"Reason One: Li is a great action hero on his own, who doesn't need any other ""one""."
461;that is, why need two Lis when one is great and cool enough?
462;"received in Asia, and though we still follow the master's path, namely from ""Lethal Weapon 4"" to ""The One,"" we don't know for sure
463;if you really want to know what Li can do with his charismatic acting as one.
464;What he needs is the director Tsui Hark's flair for presenting genuinely thrilling, outrageously exciting martial arts jet.
465;on style, which makes sense given the character.
466;li uses Ba Gua (or Pa Kua as i've heard it called) which is a very fluid, moving, evading art"
467;Take one part Highlander, add some timecop, mix in some Sliders, have Jet Li star in it and basically you have the synopsis for the One.
468;jet Li stars in multiple roles, primarily though he is the good guy cop in our dimension and the crazed serial killer in another.
469;The killer has found a way to get almost immortal by going to each of the 125 alternate dimensions and killing himself in each, thus the life energy is spread to the survivors.
470;It coems down to Jet Li vs Jet Li in a pretty cool fight sequence.
471;What I liked was the storyline .
472;Think of this as a man who can pick up police motorbikes and you will be dissapointed, think of it as Jet Li being able to pick up motorbikes and you will enjoy the film no end.
473;Despite the pretty poor acting from some actors aho have already proved themselves and let themselves down, any Jet Li or martial arts fan will be over the moon with the amazing fighting scenes.
474;This film is a must in any collection due to its outragous storyline and amazing special effects.
475;I watched this movie in theatres and once I saw a room explode and heavy metal music blared in creative places matching with the visuals, I decided it was undoubtedly the best movie I had ever seen.
476;What choice did I have, right?
477;It makes perfect sense, right?
478;and you thought that was it?Well, yeah, you were right.
479;Although I like Jet Li's older films much better, The One was still great, especially for one of his first major roles in an English speaking film (Romeo Must Die was first, but it was nowhere near as dialog intensive for Jet as The One).
