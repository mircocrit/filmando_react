id;spiegazione
1;The movie came in very good condition.
2;It is a very great movie to watch.
3;I love the motorcycles and freedom.
4;I want to do that as well!
5;Take this movie for what it is: a film with two hippies enjoying freedom by riding cool bikes through beautiful scenery with cool music.
6;Add to it some good acting by Jack Nicholson (which offsets Peter Fonda's atrocious acting) and some fairly good documentation of the zeitgeist, and it's certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.
7;The funniest revelation in the Making Of documentary was the fact that Hopper's original cut of the movie was three hours long!
8;It's definitely better than the rest of the biker films of the era, because it doesn't rely on the scandalous antics of depraved Hell's Angels.
9;Back in the States they resell the powder to a very rich man.
10;[How successful will they be?]
11;This film was a popular success due to its unusual story and the many songs, which masked a poor story.
12;Amazing story of a trip discovering America the good and the bad.
13;This movie still surprises even today.
14;Though it is dated, it gives a fascinating portrayal of two hippies rolling throguh America at a time of social change.
15;Mostly scenes and intricate editing, we see a portrait of two bikers who search for freedom.
16;For me, the delight is seeing Jack Nicholson in one of his absolute best performances.
17;He steals every scene he is in.
18;It still evokes a sense of freedom and a sense of America.
19;I was utterly surprised by this film.
20;It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it.
21;You know the old saying, Guns don`t kill people, people kill people, well after watching this film, it is a very true statement.
22;We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry.
23;spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost.
24;Wake, eat, and pay the bills.
25;He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining.
26;I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters.
27;You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape.
28;Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity.
29;Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.
30;nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies.
31;I viewed Nicholson as the average American.
32;He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom.
33;He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it.
34;I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me.
35;Great picture, sound and stream.
36;This was a classic I had always wanted to see.
37;the film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.
38;Its always news to them, but real Americans are far toobusy working and living their lives to care much about whata bunch of deadbeats are up to.
39;way act, and at best he givesa B. grade supporing character actor performance.
40;I must say, this movie was interesting in how it carried itself.
41;It reflected a nice idea of how the sub.
42;culture of freedom was mashed with the majority of close.
43;There are plenty of subtle messages in this movie that you would have to think about to understand.
44;He just wants everyone to get along.
45;This is perfect, considering many pre.
46;freedom minds were treated, it was inevitable.
47;The prostitutes were fun, the idea of going out was amazing, and BAM!
48;frame they want to cover.
49;cultural classic motorcycle film that he directed, Easy Rider, was more a statement about the political landscape of the times than a male.
50;I agree with him, or at least that is how I have always viewed the film.
51;The subjects of drugs, using and selling, dressing for hippie' success, the hard road of rural communal living (or urban communal living, for that matter), and trying to cope with the squares and rednecks were all in a day's work back in the days for those of us committed to seeking a newer world.
52;Easy Rider is the cinematic take on that proposition
53;Good character development and interesting turns as you see these men just want to make it to the big party.
54;Jacck Nicholson as the drunk Southern attorney is one of my favorites of his characters.
55;He brings them to life.
56;freedom, prejudice, community, and hypocrisy .
57;Documentary on the making of the film is very interesting.
58;Driven with an excellent sound track this is a film about two guys how throw their legs across their choppers and head out on the highway for adventure.
59;His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.
60;The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.
61;In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind.
62;The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head.
63;His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.
64;It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.
65;His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.
66;jack playing Jack to perfection.
67;Weird scenes, great music, and adventerous.
68;After seeing this movie for the first time in my mid thirties I thought to myself that perhaps this is where the modern road trip movie began.
69;Endless shots of motorcycles profile, the sky, the panorama fill this film.
70;Dennis Hopper was great as well.
71;I bought it because my brother was coming to visit and it was a big hit when we were kids.
72;I thought it would be a very pleasant blast to the past for the two of us.
73;This movie is one of those rare pieces of art that became part of the era it was trying to illustrate.
74;Most interesting is that this film has ultimately become a part of the mainstream culture it sought to distance itself from.
75;This was a very interesting film with excellent actors.
76;kept you involved with the themes.
77;Great for people who are nostalgic for the 60's
78;Great music adds just the right touch to this excellent film.
79;Great movie a snapshot of an era.
80;It really captures how it was back in those days and the mindset of the youth of that day.
81;Takes you back to another time and space.
82;I finally got around to watching this landmark .
83;I'll bet I had to be there.
84;If this film weren't so revered it would be endearing as an interesting museum piece .
85;As an artifact it is as successful as a piece of Sumerian cuneiform.
86;verbal way that films can be .
87;The scene where Jack Nicholson smokes grass is hilarious for all the wrong reasons.
88;culture in an effort to intersect its participants' motivations with traditionally appreciated dispositions like joy and innocence and googly.
89;He said it was a good movie, as I have yet to have time to watch it.
90;I loved this movie when it was first released so I thought I would love it again.
91;Watching it now a good deal of it seemed.
92;Jack Nicholson's performance was still great and a lot of fun to watch but his time is brief in the movie.
93;This also has been one of my favorites!
94;Easy Rider is the quintessential motorcycle adventure movie.
95;Pretty good soundtrack as well.
96;There are only two things good about this movie: the soundtrack and the fact that this movie propelled Jack Nickolson's career.
97;This is considered the classic 60's counterculture film.
98;Released in 1969, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranks it the 88th best film ever made, Time Magazine called it .
99;one of the ten most important pictures of the decade, and the LA Times said it remains .
100;an astonishing work of art and an overpowering motion picture experience.
101;It is the movie that rocketed Jack Nicholson to stardom.
102;There are only two redeeming elements in this film.
103;One is great Rock music from, among others, Jimi Hendrixx and the Byrds.
104;In effect, he is playing himself and he does so magnificently.
105;Easy Rider is as relevant today as it was when it first showed in 1969.
106;It could have ended just there, but they had a goal to get to Mardi Gras, and moved on.
107;the meaning of freedom will always be questioned and relevant.
108;good movie like going back to the 60's good tunes just see it it well bring you back if not we'll get the feel of what it was like
109;This is still a good movie for the most part.
110;This was closer to the truth.
111;His and Jack Nicholson are worth the price of admission.
112;making, and is as an important a film as it is a Hollywood milestone.
113;Easy Rider is a biker odyssey, and the end.
114;It is not a shining example of any of the casts best work, but it has a deep message and is a window to the era.
115;I either enjoy it or I don't.
116;I did NOT enjoy this, and I ride, so I assumed I would like this.
117;Half the time of the movie is watching these guys ride around on their motorcycles taking in the scenery.
118;The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music.
119;See this as a piece of history, and maybe even entertainment, if you are nostalgic for the 60s.
120;Easy Rider it was great!
121;Just as good as it was the first time I saw back in the 60's!
122;I have got the movie poster in my home.
123;This is the ultimate journey of unbound freedom in America in a tumultuous time(Assassination, Vietnam War, Civil Rights, Watts Riots, Cold War tensions).
124;This movie is simply stunning.
125;An awesome commentary on the world in the 60's and very expertly shot.
126;I know over the years that reviewers always tend to mock this movie and stating that the best part of the movie is the soundtrack.
127;They are correct about a great soundtrack.
128;That is the feeling one gets when heading out on a long ride with somebody you want to share the experiences with.
129;It can give it meaning in a form that you could never find taking that minute by minute planned vacation.
130;Watch this movie with the attitude of going along with it, experiencing it all for the first time just like Captain America and Billy do.
131;nicholson offers an inspiring monologue concerning extraterrestrial intelligence).
132;The acting is amateurish but the script is inspired, and the cinematography and soundtrack are terrific.
133;this movie is a symbolic snuff film, and the American Dream is the victim in the spotlight.
134;the truth hurts
135;Kind of like the end of East Bound and Down.
136;I love that 70s movies don't always have happy endings but tell real 'life' stories.
137;One bright note: Peter Fonda was gorgeous!
138;This is a great movie I saw it in 1969 And it was way ahead of its time Many of the camera tricks are still used today but were done here first.
139;This was an early Jack Nicholson movie and made him a household name This was a first for great music in a movie too!
140;While it seems a little dated now, it always struck me as a great picture of that period in American history, a glimpse of the biker subculture of the time, and a fine example of the Great American Road film.
141;I look around today and see how environmental and anti.
142;This movie gives you a real picture of that era even though the war is never mentioned.
143;It also gives a good analgy of what people hold on to even today as 'Freedom.'
144;Lost souls in a lost time, in a lost place, makes for one hek of a good movie.
145;What a classic had seen it years ago and enjoyed just as much the second time around!
146;No matter how you cut it, this movie is powerful, regardless of which side of the spectrum your looking from.
147;there are modern day interviews with most everyone in and involved with the making of the film that offers a lot of insight into the symbolism, and the day to day occourance of what went into making the film, as well as the mind set of those involved at the time.
148;It arrived on time and wasn't damaged, and I had a very happy dad lol.
149;There's a scene with a commune .
150;The sound track is good and that's about it.
151;By the way as you watch the idealistic commune life.
152;Easy Rider is a truly landmark film in the true sense of the meaning of the term.
153;While many films sort of used the notion of the late 60's, drugs, sex, rebellion, idealism, as a means to make money, this seemed really the first film to accurately reflect a realistic image of the time period with an unflinching eye.
154;while watching this movie, you may get a sense that it is sort of a western, with the western landscapes and the main characters riding 'iron' horses.
155;One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning, right before Wyatt and Billy are about to embark on their trip, Wyatt removes his watch and throws it on the ground.
156;nicholson tends to steal the scenes he is in, and gives a particularly wonderful piece about what freedom is, and why people are so afraid of it.
157;along with wonderful performances, much credit must go to the cinematographer, as the landscapes are beautiful, especially the wide shots of the western scenery.
158;And the music used was exceptionally good, fitting each scene and helping to create the proper mood throughout the film.
159;the movie presented here looks excellent, in anamorphic wide screen, and includes a commentary by Dennis Hopper.
160;Also included is a wonderful 'Making of' featurette called Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage which really helps to illustrate all that went into making this film.
161;The production, at time, often reflected the turbulent times of when the film was made, and helps to give more flavor to the movie, really enhancing the overall effect.
162;All in all, Easy Rider is a wonderful slice of outsider Hollywood that captured the true essence of an exceptionally turbulent time in America.
163;I got this item because I loved the movie.
164;Worth keeping to see over and over again.
165;i got good service and the item came in the shape it was to be in, ( NEW ).
166;He now must just enjoy watching the motorcycle exploits of others and this movie was perfect for him.
167;It was an okay film.
168;I was a little surprised that so many people feel as though it is a classic.
169;The story was interesting but enough because it showed a glimpse of what the 60's counter culture was like.
170;This sets up the rest of the film for many offbeat and bizarre encounters on this free.
171;spirited travel across scenic landscapes holds up well and so does a lot of the music, especially songs like Born to be Wild and several of the songs by the Byrds.
172;In addition, the movie has some great moments including just about every scene that features Jack Nicholson.
173;The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.
174;The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.
175;A classic 60's counter culture film with a fine soundtrack.
176;Some headliner stars are in the film early in their careers.
177;_Easy Rider_ is, of course, one of the most important pioneer independent films of the 1960s film movement.
178;Thus, I have a hesitant recommendation.
179;Few other films that I have seen capture this time period with such accuracy, vision, and emotional power.
180;The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.
181;Hopper and Fonda (among others) take us behind the scenes into the magical making of this film and how it all just seemed to flow naturally, largely unscripted.
182;I was compelled to watch it because of the iconic status as a cult classic.
183;Easy Rider is one of the best releases of 1969.
184;Dennis Hopper starred, directed, and wrote this film.
185;It received two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson).
186;This film has since been held as a history cornerstone, educating viewers the true lifestyles during the 1960's, namely the hippies.
187;Its camera effects are brilliant, though some were accidental.
188;The plot of two motorbikers on a mission to make a drug deal is brilliant.
189;The people they meet and the experiences they live add a lot of originality to the film.
190;The acting is flawless, namely Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, and Jack Nicholson.
191;unknown Nicholson into higher fame territory.
192;Easy Rider is a great movie for those looking for a great classic or a great history refresher.
193;This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.
194;Well, this holds up as a picture of America at a time when social mores were changing.
195;Most impotantly, this film heralded the entrance of a new force in films, Jack Nicholson.
196;The scene where he smokes pot and explains the Venutian plot is classic.
197;The energy of this film deflates once he departs from the film.
198;It is obviously not a piece of timeless art intended for future generations.
199;It was for that time and it accomplished its goal, which was to wake up a new generation to the possibilities of life.
200;If Woodstock The Movie, or The Last Waltz have meaning for you, you'll probably get something from it.
201;Excellent film, now dated, shows a side of life.
202;I recommend that everyone under 40 check it out to see a snapshot of the time.
203;And help install confidence for the film studios that a Independent films can be successful and also a film created on a low budget can be successful as well.
204;the film revolves around two bikers Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) who begin the movie by smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles and making a very good profit.
205;wyatt hides the money in his motorcycle's gas tank and the two embark on a trip enjoying the scenery and the freedom of traveling America.
206;Throughout the trip, we see the two drive and see the scenery of the trees, mountains and the open road way with popular music at that time.
207;the independent film was also quite volatile behind.
208;scenes that will definitely surprise people.
209;For a film created back in 1968, the film looks absolutely great, not perfect but still great.
210;No blemishes and certain outdoor scenes look absolutely fantastic and for a film 40.
211;Grain is kept and for the most part, detail of the chopper's, Billy's clothing, Wyatt's sunglasses, you see that detail.
212;For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven and during my first viewing, but that impressive soundtrack that this film is known for is nice and clear, dialogue is nice and clear and the revving of the motorcycles is nice and clear.
213;Included in the film are:* Steppenwolf .
214;pages and information on the music, the talent and an essay of the importance of the film and the beginning of New Hollywood.
215;For the most part its informative but Hopper tends to not speak for long stretches in time (I'm guessing he was engrossed in watching the film) and he's actually quite quiet.
216;(1:04:51) The crew and talent of Easy Rider give us a behind.
217;when I was watching the film, you can tell how special and how unique the film truly was.
218;From recreating the hippie commune of New Buffalo (in New Mexico) of many hippie men and women with kids all over the place to capturing that Southern feel towards hippies and men in leather (the guys weren't gay but because of they were outside of the norm of that area, they were considered offensive) and of course, the music, the motorcycles, the drug use.
219;scenes making of the film and knowing how drugged out the talent were during the filming and how some improvised scenes or scenes that were not in the script, ended up in the film is quite interesting.
220;This is one of those rare films that manages to capture American culture at that time.
221;This film embodies the term sex, drugs and rock n' roll and once you are done with the film, Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage, the documentary will definitely impress you.
222;This film is highly recommended!
223;Very true to the era.
224;I forgot how good the simple and pure attempt to live a minalmist lifestyle.
225;get it and enjoy jack nickelson is funny as .
226;The added documentary of making the film is the best feature.
227;I truly enjoyed it though I wasn't a heavy pot smoker type in those days.
228;I love bikes and the idea of riding across the country in the 60's was much more of an adventure than it is today.
229;It was amazing Dennis and Peter didn't want to make judgment on the Viet Nam War by talking about it or showing scenes they could have included.
230;I believe that was good choice.
231;Us old guys remember the times like it was yesterday.
232;New young whippersnapper college students will see this as ancient history.
233;the best part of the documentary is the inclusion of real people along the way picked on the spur of the moment by Hopper.
234;They give the film far and above what any actor could bring to the screen for authenticity.
235;That's what makes this film a cult classic.
236;a legend in the movie business if you will.
237;Those real people are incredible.
238;See it for yourself as they go over those scenes .
239;shear brilliance on Hoppers part.
240;Hopper is a brilliant actor too and he really gets your emotions bubbling.
241;This brings back a lot of memories, being on the road with the wind in my face and the sun on my back.
242;In conclusion though, this movie was enjoyable .
243;I love this movie saw it first at a drive in and still enjoy watching it!
244;Great music and beautiful scenery and Jack Nicholson!!!
245;The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson.
246;I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self.
247;The three main characters are brought to life in a most excellent way by Fonda, Nicholson and Hopper who, it is rumored, were really using drugs during the filming of this movie.
248;add to this story some great actors great songs and great scenery and you have Easy Rider so just sit back and enjoy the journey
249;besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18.
250;It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic.
251;The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen).
252;And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?)
253;Great actors acting pretty poorly.
254;They both were clear and easy to watch.
255;Easy Rider resonated with film.
256;, but man, oh, man did they have fun along the way.
257;I always voted for moving on and then returning to the commune.
258;But that misgiving aside, the music's fun, especially for younger viewers who've never heard Don't Bogart Me and the movie's a classic.
259;I have seen it a hundred times and I'll probably see it another hundred times .
260;time dope dealer (played by record mogul Phil Spector), embark on a journey across America, ostensibly to enjoy a good time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.
261;Along the way, they encounter, initially, the more idealistic side of America in a New Mexico hippie commune and a farm in Arizona.
262;nicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.
263;individual freedom: They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them.
264;The other is, of course, Nicholson's star.
265;uproarious and, later, thoughtful performance here cemented his reputation as a top.
266;If one can get by its being highly dated, it still works as a period piece.
267;This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's Top 100 films of all time list.
268;That sums up the first half of the film.
269;jack Nicholson is amazing as usual.
270;He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in.
271;the cinematography is very good.
272;L szl Kov cs does good work and he captures the scenery very well.
273;It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.
274;The survivors proceed to New Orleans for Mardi gras as planned, and encounter two hookers (notably Karen Black for one), get mind blowingly high, where Hopper shows outstanding camera work and creativity in this masterpiece.
275;The sound track album was a big hit in 1969 as well.
276;as a special feature, Dennis Hopper's running commentary on the film brings special insight to one of the finest, most colorful period flicks ever made.
277;This movie captures the essence of the lste 60's and early 70's.
278;It should be required viewing for anybody that's interested in that period.
279;The concept of this movie is simple!
280;I have seen this movie several times I still think its one of the best movies ever made.
281;Think of the freedom these two felt riding those awesome bikes cross.
282;That true freedom starts with accepting yourself other people for who you or they are.
283;Both Peter Fonda Dennis Hopper did a great job in this movie.
284;I recommend this movie alot.
285;This is certainly the best independent film ever made and is also one of the best films ever.
286;This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter.
287;culture a. k. a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the land of the free and the home of the brave?
288;jack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.
289;otherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.
290;Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full.
291;thanks for getting the movie to me so fast my dad enjoyed watching it for his b. day
292;'Easy Rider' is a film which encaptures the 60s brilliantly.
293;It is a film about people and about achieving the ultimate goal complete satisfaction and freedom.
294;The film is shot magnificently and makes the world seem unreal at times.
295;Which paradoxically makes them feel they are experiencing something more real than they could ever have imagined.
296;Watch this film it is brilliant!
297;It is as simple as this.
298;This movie is about freedom and peace.
299;All I can say is that if you find yourself doing just that, then you really must delve further into the nature of freedom.
300;It is the one word of description to label it and define it.
301;this may very well be the most patriotic film ever made.
302;This movie is not just about riding, it is about counter culture and love for freedom.
303;It is their story and a remarkable road trip on a bike.
304;This movie brought us 3 great actors.
305;I love and have a passion for all motorcycles from dirt, speed and street.
306;I do ride it on the dangerous streets in the city where I live.
307;Motorcycle riding has given me plenty of confidence, and it has taught me to be a better driver in a car or a boat.
308;My husband, Darrell, suggested I learn the right way all over again.
309;I had the most incredible teacher who did not make fun of me or get angry during class and was very patient.
310;pretty small to hold up a Harley.
311;He saw I was determined and cheered me on.
312;This one person, my teacher, Daniel David Jorasz was killed on his bike this past week, riding the right way.
313;Also, respect and look out for motorcycles they share the road too.
314;A somewhat interesting movie due to the time period this movie was filmed.
315;the movie is totally overrated mostly due to the cast, Fonda, Hopper, and Jack Nicolas.
316;This movie is the quintessential on the open road and free movie.
317;I love their hippy experiences, and Jack Nicholson's character comes in at the right time on their trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
318;I actually like Jack Nicolson's character.
319;The film sets a mood for the 60's biker .
320;counterculture will like this film.
321;the girl I saw it with later broke my heart!But I still love the film!A truly original and revolutionary film!One of the best ever!
322;Easy Rider is one of those movies that took me forever to see and when I finally did I was dissapointed somewhat.
323;It featured some of the best rock music of the time in the soundtrack.
324;The cinematography is wonderful as well.
325;But it is worth a watch if you want to see some great actors before they hit their prime.
326;It's good for a viewing or two.
327;I thought it was a excellent movie and very awesome because this is another movie I watched some years ago too,and I think it's still a great oldie but goodie.
328;You can see how movies have changed today, but Peter Fonda and company did a half decent job considering they probably were independent back then and did the best they could.
329;This is a one of a kind classic.
330;They say this is a classic.
331;It's a terrific journey !
332;The story is simple but the actors (if they really are 
333;The Nicholson performance is unforgettable.
334;EASY RIDER is a CULT movie and it still explains very well how the US society was in the 70's.
335;Try to get the 30th anniversary remastered version including a very funny retrospective documentary to better understand the whole concept of Easy Rider.
336;the music was great and some of the cinematography was good.
337;I ordered this with a bit of caution because of the age of the product.
338;It arrived in the time promised and I was very pleased with that as well.
339;of Documentary Easy Rider: Shaking The Cage (feat.
340;The 80 page book Easy Rider by Lee Hill is interesting and includes all you'll ever want to know about the film.
341;He's an outsider artist , in all the sense of the expression.
342;this picture, is reflect of his own character.
343;the increase dark shadows will cover the landscape and will carry to that magnificent and poetic ending.
344;If six was nine of Hendrix, Born to be wild and the Pusher of Steppenwolf , or the weight were emblemeatic songs of its age which reflected wise and sincerely , the expecatations of a generation just in the year in which the man reached a superb scientific and technological triumph in Jul 29 1969 .
345;when my teacher said we wear going to watch easy rider i was exited because i had always wanted to see it and oh god this movie is to good to be true, from the style, the cinematography and the narrative, to the fantastic soundtrack.
346;i have always thought Dennis Hopper was a genius and after seeing this i am positive.
347;The message of peacefulness and community with its underlying criticism of those who take this concept to brain.
348;Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda all give great performances.
349;This is a very impressive BD and I know that if your considering on purchasing, you will not be disappointed with it.
350;style case with essays and photos.
351;Great classic from a by gone time, being a motorcycle rider myself It brought back a lot of memories.
352;all time classic nice bikes early Jack one.
353;Put Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson together and you have an iconic film about the crash landing that was the end of the Sixties in America.
354;the insight you get into how it was put together is both funny and amazing.
355;I can see how this may appeal more to Baby Boomers than those born after 1970, but everyone should enjoy Easy Rider.
356;The ending is powerful and makes a lasting impact.
357;It's a classic, what can I say.
358;One of a kind film with a great soundtrack.
359;I loved this movie when it first came out.
360;Even though it's dated, it's still fun to watch and reminisce.
361;The interesting part of the film is that it tried to portray the counterculture movement as the heirs to the traditional American life.
362;He then defines freedom as the ability to do what you want, when you want, without any societal restraints.
363;The Founding Fathers of the United States defined freedom [liberty] as the ability to do what was right.
364;Easy Rider and the existentialist culture succeeded in shifting the altering the concept of American liberty and freedom away from what the Founders envisioned.
365;overall, the movie is a good representation of the existentialist life.
366;However it is more than thatI admit when I first saw EASY RIDER I was not too thrilled but after seeing again and looking at it more closely I realized how great a movie it is.
367;It is a true experience of the uncensored sixties.
368;when you look at this movie it seems really simple so why was it so successful?
369;that is what makes EASY RIDER so special.
370;The fact that it is the ultimate sixties experience.
371;You will enjoy this movie.
372;Best when combined with some herbs.
373;known appreciation for New Hollywood cinema.
374;there are better films by almost any measuring stick.
375;An uncomplicated film for complicated times
376;Well, along the way the boys encounter friends and enemies (mostly the latter) until they end up in jail for parading without a permit!
377;Peter Fonda's Captain America character is a pure optimist and the embodiment of what America used to be.
378;He is accepting, caring and fiercely original.
379;Fonda turns in a strong understated performance.
380;Nicholson steals the show even for the brief amount of time he's actually in the film.
381;This is one trip you must take.
382;Dennis Hopper should've gotten the golden palm for this movie, make that picture (he did win for best new filmmaker, but he deserved the bigger prize too), that give sweeping cinematography, a superb soundtrack, acting believable: alternately funny and tragic, and a feel that is all it's own (and those that ripped it off aren't any better).
383;They sell it to a guy right next to an airport and then starts the triumphant tunes The Pusher and Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf as they go on the road with a load of money in Fonda's gastank.
384;fonda and Hopper represented something amazing to the generation that they were about, and that's what made the box office bucks
385;Must See, if only once, for anyone.
386;This is one of the best road pictures ever made.
387;With elements of realism, art style cinematography and a great sounding psychedelic country rock soundtrack that drives this film along the two lane highways of the southwest and deepsouth in this modern day western from the late 60's.
388;truly an american original film masterpiece and worth owning for your film collection.
389;nice slice of regular America as well.
390;what amazed me about the film is that it worked as an insightful allegory of the path of the hippy movement .
391;So it was wild to see the film suggest the fatuity of the movement, its self.
392;great performances by the stars.
393;just looking for the next high, the next lay, the next thrill.
394;With one world in the straight world and one in the wild world of Fonda and Hopper, he was able to see dangers that the other two were oblivious to.
395;the 35th anniversary edition is one of the very few movies whose making of segments were worth watching.
396;Luckily, wiser hands wrested editorial control from him and gave us the masterpiece we have now.
397;a great film, a fine period piece and an extraordinary commentary on a lost generation of seekers and dreamers.
398;filled resistance of the powers.
399;This film is cinematically stunning, backed by a superb soundtrack and top.
400;notch cast (Jack Nicholson's first major role).
401;Hopper ices the cake with a masterfully edited psychedelic scene that remains unsurpassed in realism and intensity, and then hits us with a chilling ending . . . the 60s has never been portrayed with such relevance or eloquence.
402;Although I am not a motorcycle rider and I have never used psychedelic drugs, I still found this to be a great movie.
403;If you have allowed these two elements of the film to keep you from watching it, I highly recommend putting those thoughts aside and viewing this.
404;the main idea of the film is freedom.
405;This something could be America, but you feel it is more profound than that.
406;jack Nicholson has the best lines of the movie when he explains that we love to talk about freedom, but we are scared to death of people who actually live it.
407;A very important idea considering the war that was going on at the time of this movie.
408;again, I highly recommend watching this movie.
409;If you love America as much as I do you will love this.
410;Even by watching this movie it makes me love America even more.
411;Makes me proud to live here.
412;If you love motercycles hey this is it.
413;Where living for the moment become an obsession, your life's work!
414;It was always in the above $70 price range but found it for $16.19 one day.
415;One awesome flick about two guys doin their thing.
416;society can never stomp out the spirit of Capt. America and Billy!Two Thumbs Up for Fonda and Hopper .
417;I'm proud to own a copy and be part of the modern motorcycle generation.
418;This was always a great story, and presented in an unusual but great way.
419;A film that can be watched over and over, and always comes out new.
420;Peter Fonda is the king of cool, as is Dennis Hopper.
421;As excellent to watch now as it was over 40 years ago, great trip down memory lane, fascinating to watch
422;Great scenes of the old west back in the 60s and a really nice sound track.
423;Jack Nicholson got his star in this movie.
424;B movie at its best
425;We know that in some circles it's considered an American classic.
426;there's some nice scenery and of course it's a product of the early 70's so if you're into that era or are a collector, add it to your collection.
427;Sound track plus movie, fantastic !
428;Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of.
429;And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug.
430;quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock.
431;So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies.
432;It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie.
433;But as far as being a great flick.
434;You gotta love Nicholson in his first movie role: young, head full of hair and brilliant.
435;I would give this one star but for the fact that the music is pretty good, it helped launch Jack Nicholson, and Fonda has gone on to do some very good movies and Hopper some great ones.
436;To me, it is a classic, but that is in my world as it is in many others.
437;But there is a certain charm in it all.
438;i think just about anyone should see this movie.
439;culture classic, Hopper's  Rider jolted a Hollywood in transition when it became an unexpected hit in 1969, encapsulating the freewheeling spirit of the times and the divide between the youth culture and the Establishment.
440;And I enjoyed the audio commentary also, but that could be because I like Dennis Hopper.
441;One of the greatest motorcycle movie, ever made.
442;To enjoy this movie, you must have a love for the open road, choppers and harleys.
443;commie And Poseur Actors:Fonda and Nicholson(Hopper is good though).
444;The best Biker Film is Hells Angels 69' and it actually has them in it!
445;good movie just thought it whould be better but i guess that it was great for its time 3 out of 5
446;Despite having aged in the last 30+ years, Easy Rider remains one of the most important and influential films ever made.
447;Written by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda (with Terry Southern) and directed by Hopper
448;Even more amazing is how detailed and elaborate this film actually is.
449;They also encounter ignorance, bigotry, and, eventually, George Hanson (Nicholson), a drunken lawyer who joins the boys on their ride.
450;He definitely steals the show, though.
451;drug culture, and has a similar grainy look and feel to it.
452;While I think Midnight Cowboy is a better film, Easy Rider is a more important one.
453;One of the best (and most haunting) moments comes in the end.
454;This is an unforgettable motion picture experience.
455;The characters portrayed in this great film represent the very epitome of the 1960s baby.
456;The progeny of the folks who won World War II, these young boomer.
457;head, drift toward New Orleans for a big drunk party, picking up along the way another equally purposeless bum (the great Jack, in a stunning role!)
458;this is a great film, don't miss it.
459;It's the anthem of a generation, the once.
460;This is an all time classic movie from the 60's and early 70's eras.
461;Really nice bikes shown in this movie!
462;The movie reveals a great friendship between two, then three, traveling partners.
463;though made with little money, the way it's shot, and the characters it produces makes Easy Rider a great classic movie.
464;If you don't understand it the first time, watch it again.
465;This movie brought back memories of that time period.
466;It was fun watching most of it!
467;But still it tells of an era in America .
468;Easy Rider captures a time and spirit in America when the people on the left were the voices of true liberation, individuality and total freedom while those on the right stood for thought control and conformity.
469;their search for true freedom in America begins.
470;As great as Jack's role is, he is merely a prop in the overall story to illustrate the complex emmotions and reactions society had about the 60's counter culture as embodied in Wyatt and Billy.
471;This is the idea that free sex and drugs are liberating to the human spirit.
472;Plus, in addition to the movie being a classic, I really enjoyed Peter's book.
473;It was nice to get to know him and his family.
474;It is an awesome movie and i loved that it was an anniversary edition, it had a sound track disk in it.
475;ld, born to be wi.
476;made for a low budget of 350,000.400,000 bucks, it nevertheless has some big names .
477;the two leads, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, plus Jack Nicholson in a best.
478;nominated role, and Karen Black, Robert Walker and Luke Askew.
479;Opposing the big names are the local talent of rednecks, sherriffs and hicks, all convincing in their parts.
480;Directed by Hopper, the movie does feature some unusual edits and cuts.
481;if you are Jack Nicholson fan, you must see this movie.
482;There is much scenic countryside shown throughout the movie, but the last shot from the helicopter is amazing for both its beauty and its ugliness.
483;i give it a solid 4 stars.
484;The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.
485;it seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film.
486;This is a true classic.
487;Truly, Nicholson is one of the greatest actors ever.
488;From Terms of Endearment to Batman, Nicholson makes almost any movie worth watching.
489;many scenes are laugh out loud funny.
490;The music is a huge part of the culture and so it is in the movie.
491;Along the way they hit the highs and lows of the then American Dream.
492;It's a poetic piece which meant a lot to us when we saw it.
493;They let us see the South they saw and listen to the rather haunting words of Nicholson.
494;the picture has now become a milestone for low budget producers saying sopmething worthwhile.
495;And a damn good sound track to boot. 
496;so I could relate to the landscape really well, and the tolerant stoned behaviour and the bigotted persecution.
497;it is that insight and the practice of sincere positive sorting out your mind and your actions that makes Free people a threat toany one in Denial.
498;technically it may have its faults but overall it got the spirit correct.
499;also the documentary is invaluable.
500;peace and go for a long ride man.
501;it is both a metaphor and a history of its time.
502;the superb music sounds like a replay of AM radio of that era, and the scenes still bring a hunger and longing of wanderlust and desire to crank up the bike.
503;The acting is, of course, what it is .
504;This movie is so great.
505;Dennis Hopper not only made a fun picture, he touched on the very issue that makes America a great place, freedom.
506;The first time I saw this film I was like, this is a classic?
507;Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda riding their choppers towards New Orleans and their quest to be free is a classic American movie.
508;Everyone should see this film and listen.
509;one always wonders about these things.
510;overall, I'm happy to have finally added this to my collection, and to be able to share it with all my similar.
511;Anyways, I love this movie.
512;Its definetely worth one watch at least.
513;i can easily say that Easy Rider is among the five WORST films I have ever seen in my life!
514;It was one of the first to really make inroads in the high.
515;Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda pretty much made this movie on their own, funded it, and then filmed themselves riding motorcycles across the US.
516;much of the movie is full of the gorgeous scenery of the United States.
517;The beauty of Monument Valley and other locations is brought vividly to life.
518;In many ways it's a celebration of the wild range of landscapes.
519;there are also a variety of cultures shown here, which is equally interesting.
520;town deep south, where the teen girls are intrigued by the strangers and the men.
521;There are the prostitutes of New Orleans, the quiet farmer and his family, and more.
522;Everyone has their own view on life and what it means to live.
523;this is definitely a guy's film.
524;Most of their talk, though, is wild ramblings due to the drugs.
525;He praised the farmer who had a wife, a family, and a quiet homestead where he was able to live off the grid.
526;It's also a powerful glimpse into time, to see the forces that were at work in the US in the late 60s.
527;I guess you have to be a pot smoking hippie to enjoy it!
528;style buckskin pants and shirts.
529;Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L. a. the two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.'
530;On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter.
531;SPOILERS AHEAD!On the surface of this searching, interesting yet self.
532;consciously cynical film are certain production values that are impressive and memorable.
533;Laslo Kovaks' cinematography is sharp and spacious.
534;their attitude towards women is ambiguous, at most.
535;The scene in the New Orleans graveyard is pure, artsy.
536;while at the same time numbing oneself to the possibility of experiencing joy through committed love, which builds the ego up and makes it feel more secure, alive, and creative.
537;like Miles Davis once said, You've got to learn the rules, to break the rules.
538;Now I get to watch it with my friends and family.
539;Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, and more star in what is considered to be the best biker movie ever made.
540;before you go there, I am very much a child of that era and the sound track is fantastic.
541;That's what I watch the movie for from time to time.
542;This movie may not appeal to everyone, but it definitely lives up to the title.
543;It doesnt reach out and grab you and force you to pay attention, but it's not boring either.
544;It is pretty relaxing to watch.
545;There really isn't much of a story, but overall, the movie is interesting.
546;Add to that the killer soundtrack and Jack Nicholson's star making (and in my opinion, his best) performance and you've got yourself one hell of a film.
547;Where they proceed to have themselves a good old time .
548;This movie is also a fasinating look at the 60's counterculture.
549;class viewing group to a younger, college.
550;This is the movie that revolutionized and redirected the industry by proving that phenomenal returns could be made from a modest investment, if it appealed to its new audience, as well as launching an interest in producing youth.
551;minded and hateful of their longhaired freedom and use of drugs.
552;The title also points to our anti.
553;heroes' rootless natures, who's capricious decision to discover their world directs them to the road's infinite freedom.
554;riding bike with a 'stars.
555;colored bush hat, fringed buckskin jacket, and an Indian necklace of animals' teeth.
556;Their names refer, of course, to the Western legends of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, and this is indicative of their personalities.
557;Wyatt is quiet, more mature, and content with any surrounding
558;A quote from the coarsely brilliant George Carlin comes to mind, who wrote The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it.
559;relish also Jack Nicholson in the performance that made him a star.
560;Oh yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom, but they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.
561;This has become one of my favorite movies.
562;story line is really good.
563;if anyone likes bike movies they will like this one.
564;All I can say isawesome, the surround sound, the widescreen effects, I satthere shattered to see a whole new perspective of this movie.
565;davidson through the States for five weeks and as I said at the Virginia State HOG Rally, 'When I saw the movie Easy Rider for the first time One day I'm going to go to the States and ride a Harley and I am doing it now'I will keep watching this movie and also listen to the great music which is part of the history of my generation.
566;ness of this film is accurate.
567;The cinematography is excellent, especially considering the age of the film and its budget.
568;The acting is really good and Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his long career.
569;the scenes at the commune may elicit confusion or even a giggle from younger members a contemporary audience, but hopefully these people will look a bit deeper than the long hair and the funny clothes to realize that these characters represented a very real subculture in the late '60s
570;Today, it is reason to pause for introspection on the larger issues: What is important to us?
571;It is a look into the fringe of society at the time of its making yet the film explores themes that are just as relevant today as it was then.
572;So there is the meaning I took from this film.
573;The pure entertainment value is awesome as well.
574;Great actors, beuitiful scenery and the development of the characters made me feel as though I knew them.
575;two friends look around to meet new people, to exercise freedom and to know native country better to a dramatic extent.
576;rather funny and scandalous than sexy and unpredictable to a contemporary viewer movie is a nice musical and historical low budget work with recently convinced Spector playing a bad boy in.
577;This is one of the best packages we bought so far.
578;An excellent movie with a splendid sound track.
579;A genuine classic and 'must.
580;Still, the appeal is the authenticity of certain aspects of the era .
581;a technique that worked truly well and certainly showed a lot of us who were used to Hollywood linear film.
582;And beyond all that is the amazing music.
583;great, original THRILLING music from the absolute golden era of rock and roll.
584;This is one classic flick.
585;It is very thought provoking,interesting, enlightening, and generally fun (until the end).
586;bought it as a gift for my boyfriend.
587;arrived as described, in a timely fashion.
588;a great film for its day.
589;I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's.
590;sure, the movie has its good points.
591;The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well.
592;Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release.
593;Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.
594;the performances in the movie are also very good.
595;Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role!
596;His acting definitely got better.
597;Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom?
598;so, the movie does have its good points .
599;the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson .
600;A classic movie with a classic story.
601;The detail of Peter Fonda's face and leather jacket.
602;the metallic paint in that beautiful bike of his.
603;wow, glad I lived long enough to have seen this.
604;It's all about wide open spaces, the open road, freedom, and of course: choppers.
605;The soundtrack is a gem.
606;But there was a time before the internet and cell phones, and easy rider is a strong youth statement from such a time.
607;Easy Rider is a legendary movie.
608;up of Fonda's face as he says Its great thing for a man to live off the land, you should be proud.
609;The stylised late sixties 'acid induced' camera work, fabulous sound track and wonderful male leads is a testament that even when people are doped to the eye balls some stories are begging to be told.
610;dennis Hopper is so wonderful in this he holds the screen.
611;It does frustrate me a bit because I like many of my contemporaries imagine myself on a big Harley cruising through the landscape, any way 'the times they are a changing' and some day I hope we will see more strong, sassy and beautiful women on the screen.
612;What do the characters and their actions signify.
613;The thesis of the film is around the camp fire spoken by Jack Nicholson.
614;Jack Nicholson and the great soundtrack are really the only interesting or entertaining aspects of this film.
615;If you want excitement, great story and script, great acting danger and an even better soundtrack from the same era, go for Performance or Get Carter.
616;Following 2 bikers moving dope and on a journey across the southwestern US, constant wanderers spending time in prison, on a commune and more.
617;An amazing score compliments expansive scenes of Western US.
618;Timeless, Historic, snapshot of an era.
619;Everything worked great and had good picture and sound it just was not my favorite movie.
620;This film represents myself, and my generation from the early 60's.
621;I understand and identify with it it completely.
622;Sometimes those timess become a little fuzzy in my memory, but a film like this brings it all back.
623;It was actually made during that time also, with actors in it who truly felt their parts.
624;Whenever I feel like like revisiting my 60's adventures, I watch this movie.
625;A great American indie that needed to be made before the 60's left us for good.
626;This is grass man it gives you a whole new way of looking at the day.
627;I understood it then and still love it's theme of 'freedom'.
628;Peter's line, toward the end, We blew it!
629;This is a historical movie telling of the dreams of a lot of us baby boomers.
630;A fantastic movie made exactly as it should have been made by exactly who had to make it.
631;Easy to believe that's the way a lot of people think.
632;a lot of my friends like the end,but I like the rest.
633;establishment film with an in depth commentary from its key players.
634;Hopper and Fonda discuss the physical and mental experience of making such a two.
635;beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image.
636;Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance.
637;which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done .
638;The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.
639;I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.
640;With a low budget and an inspired mind, Hopper and Fonda created a movie which is all raw talent, youth,and freedom.
641;Whether they are right or wrong, the film is an interesting document about America at the time of crisis, and the wishes of man to be released from cables of time and age.
642;The ending of the film is profoundly pessimistic about the prospects for freedom and independence.
643;It's also rooted in a number of great cinematic traditions, aside from the Road Movie genre which it helped to invent.
644;the performances of the cast are delightful .
645;Nicholson's is rightly feted, and Hopper's is very Dennis Hopper .
646;here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).
647;as a compare and contrast job, I think they'd make a fascinating study.
648;The Bottom Line:A deserved classic, Easy Rider functions so well as a capsule of its time that it should be used in history classes
649;great motion picture that admittedly lags a bit in its first half hour but hits the ground running once Jack Nicholson comes aboard and never stops for breath.
650;I have loved this film since it was first released and began playing at drive.
651;The teaming of Peter Fonda (his top film), Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson was pure brillance in casting.
652;the larger theme here is the perceived freedom of the sixties, which turns out at every intersection to be little more than a fantasy.
653;But I need to say right here that the filmscore for this movie represents one of the top Classic Rock albums of the 20th Century.
654;Great uncomplicated movie and nice to just sit back relax and watch somthing that wasnt to complicated
655;It is great to have the classic Easy Rider now on Blu.
656;Now I watch it on our 106 Home Theater, and my Harley is parked in the garage!
657;What an iconic movie this one was.
658;And notice how YOUNG these guys look.
659;EASY RIDER is a fairly entertaining relic from the counterculture of the sixties.
660;Fonda is the producer and Hopper is the director.
661;Along the way they hook up with a drunk (Jack Nicholson) whose performance provides some of the most memorable scenes in the movie.
662;In spite of the tough field, EASY RIDER was still able to win nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson), Original Story and Screenplay.
663;Now I took the time to order it and I fully grasp it.
664;Saw it after viewing the Wild Angels, with Fonda too.
665;Easy Rider brought back some good memories of days gone by.
666;Easy Rider is a counterculture touchstone.
667;There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.
668;The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.
669;The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand.
670;The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.
671;After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.
672;This is not one of my most favorite movies.
673;This portrays hippies in a real dramatic light.
674;Let's you in their world and wanting more.
675;I liked it and highly recommend it.
676;But few such films prove potent enough to retain the favor of audiences in perpetuity.
677;Born To be Wild'37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again.
678;I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack.
679;It was an important film but not a very good one.
680;Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one.
681;The film drew me in, such a very good film.
682;Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long.
683;I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him.
684;The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled.
685;The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film.
686;The film comes alive when George, played by Jack Nicholsen as an ACLU lawyer.
687;What a handsome dude, a purveyor of many roles to come.
688;But best of all, is Peter Fonda and the quiet, intelligent, Captain America/Wyatt.
689;Captain America and Billy find the whorehouse George directed them to and drop acid in the cemetery with two hookers, Karen Black in a great role.
690;It is a long acid trip that sets the standard for hallucination portrayals for years to come.
691;in with a few local yokels leads to their undoing.
692;But it is also an honest perspective on the counterculture movement.
693;Fonda and Hopper's portrayal of that experience is free of the romanticized tone that characterizes so many other films from this era.
694;Hopper is happy because they've made it to their destination with their drug money.
695;Easy Rider, one of the first films of its kind, was a ritualistic experience and viewed (often repeatedly) by youthful audiences in the late 1960s as a reflection of their hopes of liberation and fears of the Establishment.
696;it is one of those films that transcends itself.
697;amazing how this archetype resonates.
698;Easy Rider, the winner of the Cannes Film Festival (Best Film by a new Director) speaks volumes about the time in which it was made: the pinnacle of one of the most socially tumultuous periods in U. s. history.
699;narrative is the road, and this time a couple of longhair hippies ride it on motorcycles.
700;It's the sense of family, and community, that Billy doesn't feel comfortable with.
701;He's his own man, or wants to be, and community is anathema to his character.
702;The ACLU lawyer, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) joins the pair and finds inspiration and new joy in life from the road experience.
703;The tension between Billy the Kid and the Hippie commune can be viewed, among other things, as the cinematic representation of the struggle for true Individualism in the Anglo American psyche.
704;The film is European art.
705;Lazslo Kovakcs' cinematography is more than breathtaking
706;A fine classic to own and watch through the years, to think about and enjoy.
707;Referring to Jack Nicholson's dialogue in this movie: It's about freedom as and soon as you start showing your freedom and waving your flag.
708;They used the best they had back then.
709;Easy Rider is about freedom, freedom being taken away.
710;Sure, it's dated and funny to watch those 3 well.
711;known actors in their early days getting baked around a campfire, but it has a message.
712;This film, along with a few others, managed to capture that moment in history when a counter culture emerged during the 1960's and early 1970's.
713;Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it.
714;Easy Rider is definitely a movie for its period.
715;smoking, and other illicit drug type of movie that reflects the period that was .
716;the behind the scene commentary was interesting and insightful.
717;The road scenes were just gorgeous, and the motorcycle drive through New Mexico was quite impressive.
718;the is a film that has survived the times and should be viewed.
719;This was always a favorite flick of mine.
720;dealin' buddies, sell their stuff, make money, get bigger bikes and go cross country on two Harley's during the era of Beautify America , a time of revolution and peace, love rock and roll.
721;Rock and roll: Easy Rider has one of THE best soundtracks as well
722;I think what makes this a classic flick, the fact that when it was released we had wars going on in Vietnam and at home in the US of A, between protestors and government.
723;best movie of all time.
724;Watch for Jack Nicholson in one of his earliest and most unforgettable performances as George: the boozing, small.
725;The film editing is at times odd but other times, brilliant.
726;which best describes co. writer/director Dennis Hopper's personality.
727;It marked the beginning of my love for motorcycles (and hippies).
728;The movie has an excellent 60's music soundtrack played alongside beautiful Americana landscapes: it is a biker's dream trip.
729;There is also a strange but interesting LSD scene which attempts to show the psychotic side of a trip.
730;Peter Fonda (Jane's brother and Henry's son) is still working and gave an Oscar nominated performance in 1997's Ulee's Gold.
731;Grew up around motorcycles and riding(and I still ride ) so it brought back old memories of good times!Excellent movie!!
732;It Was Excellent great movie seen when I was a kid even better now that I'm older thanks Amazon !!!!
733;Positives are beautiful country and good music and some entertaining parts.
734;This is the blue ray book awesome tells the whole story IF THE SUN well any way that's old Amelia Lousiana this is a real good movie your mom wouldn't let you watch it's good
735;this is the most real movie about hippidom (is that a word?)
736;yea, it has great scenery, great tunes, and an interesting plot, but the reason the movie is so great is that everything is so REAL!
737;i dont see how people can enjoy movies like half baked and yet havent even heard of this one.
738;Sitting in a USC screening room with Peter Fonda, I remember seeing this iconic film before it was released.
739;Reel life was real life.
740;this film was the first big youth movie that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.
741;For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.
742;There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.
743;I liked the stoned Freedom speech from Jack Nicholson.
744;I believed what Jack said.
745;This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.
746;i still love the joyful, free, wide.
747;angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild pulsating on the soundtrack.
748;This is an enormously famous movie, one that has achieved iconic status.
749;That means it's great, right?
750;But in this birds nest of oddness there are enough true gems to put it firmly in the forefront of classic cinema.
751;In other words, you have to believe it to see it.
752;I do believe some of it, sometimes, and this movie helps me glimpse that small part.
753;any way, good flick, and it rings with an historical authenticity that is almost unequaled.
754;Its great contribution is that it was made at the peak of the era, and commented on that era very eloquently.
755;Usually the good commentary doesn't come along for many years, but Easy Rider pretty much hits the nail on the head.
756;Plus the bikes are great.
757;i highly recommend a very similar film called Vanishing Point , which is a better film, and another dose of very authentic and high.
758;cant wait to give it for a gift to a special friend who loves riding.
759;great prices, shape and received fast!
760;Loved the pace and the way the director depicted life back then.
761;Wish i was born back then.
762;The greatest film in history?
763;It'll get you that hippy vibe (the flower powery dope and love one, not the beat freight hopping whisky drinkin Kerouac one!)
764;It's a film you have to see to grasp modern American culture.
765;But it will surely give you a good evening in front of the TV and a good feeling.
766;Now I have to find her the poster!
767;Hopper and Nicholson have performed better on their respective crappers.
768;The REgion 2 edition will have great packaging, the same booklet, but instead of just the soundtrack, it will include a new master of the film and the documentary easy riders, raging bulls , which is also avaible as a paperback novel best seller by Biskind.
769;knit suits, disco and the Ford Pinto!
770;I remember seeing this movie when it first came out.
771;I'm an old hippie, so I really enjoyed the crazy memories that this movie evoked.
772;Jack Nickolson is so funny and, of course, Peter Honda and Dennis Hopper are classic!
773;If you want to know what it was really like in the 1960s, this is the movie for you!
774;But otherwise a great, classic, and fairly accurate movie about the counterculture and just wanting to be free.
775;You gotta see it at least once.
776;It was an interesting theme .
777;an interesting view point on the American motorcyclist in the late 60s by society.
778;But it is fun to see the broad cast of characters too, including Jack Nicholson, there was even an small scene with Dan Haggerty.
779;I will say the ending was quite a surprise!
780;Come with an awesome booklet I hadn't known about,with cool photos and rare interviews with the cast plus in blue ray totally enhances a classic
781;Good photography of a beautiful country.
782;As a motorcyclist, I enjoyed it.
783;I love the bikes in the movie.
784;The special feature w/ the interviews of the actors was really interesting.
785;The best acting I've seen from Peter Fonda .
786;a period piece about freedom and prejudice during those times.
787;interesting to see after last viewing in 1969.
788;and great to see jack in one of his first appearances!
789;amazing music enhanced by the sun setting over the desert scenery.
790;The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise.
791;Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling.
792;For the most part, it succeeds.
793;They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life.
794;In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.
795;the story itself is actually pretty thin.
796;This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters.
797;Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable.
798;Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free.
799;music plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel.
800;Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era.
801;The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.
802;the movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless.
803;I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.
804;ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.
805;great movie love the extras at the end found out a lot of info will share and watch again liked it
806;Every viewing of this film is a voyage in a time machine back to a time when society was undergoing a significant cultural transformation.
807;Easy Rider will always be an important film because its success helped make it possible for more and more independent films to be made.
808;I knew of this movie since I was A Kid and I Am A Motorcycle Fan but I found this movie Not to be as great as I thought It would be, because Its Not very realistic (As an up.
809;I bought this movie on VHS used and I Am very pleased with It.
810;I thought it would be a great laugh (most of us were young adults when this movie came out) along with some hot chocolate and pop corn.
811;Who know's it may be the most popular gift to exchange!
812;Was fun to see Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper in their younger days.
813;I am sure this movie had it's day and back in the time period it was filmed it was entertaining I suppose.
814;Jack Nicholson works great a comedy relief.
815;If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.
816;Hey, thanks a lot, man, I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.
817;The amazing amount of similar themes running through all three of these films is impressive.
818;The characters in all three of these movies depict a great love of adventure and a great joy of being out on the open road.
819;Also, they all have a great, cinematic and panoramic, wide.
820;Watching these films gets one out of one's own head and puts one right into the world of the film.
821;The scenery in all three films is stunning and absolutely breathtaking.
822;You get taken along for a ride that goes not only far and wide out into the world but, also, deep into the hidden spaces of one's heart and mind.
823;All three of these films will make you think about your own life in particular as well as the greater meaning of life in general.
824;They are deep, psychological films that demand conscious labor of intellectual thought and emotional soul searching on the part of the viewer.
825;You get taken for a ride, but it is definitely NOT easy!
826;brought me back to a time when I myself, like the character in the movie, was 22 years old and questioning my place in life: what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, where I wanted to live, how I wanted to live, and who I wanted to be with.
827;I realize now that I was seeking a sense of place to fit in and a community to be a part of that I felt comfortable in more than merely trying to find myself.
828;Watching INTO THE WILD hits home on all these points and more!
829;I remember having just seen The Grateful Dead in concert in Hartford, Connecticut with my good buddy, Jimmy, in May of 1997, and feeling like I wanted to just bust loose of all of the constraints of society that seemed to be holding me back from my true calling .
830;I was feeling like a wild animal caught in a trap, and I wanted to be free.
831;I was always talking about moving to Alaska, to live in freedom and stuff like that .
832;so I can really relate to what Christopher McCandless (the real character and promising young man of the true story of INTO THE WILD) was going through.
833;He never got the chance to.
834;When he reached Alaska, he hooked up with some of his old friends from Dunstable, Massachusetts who had also moved up there to make money working on the pipeline and on fishing boats.
835;He found work up there for a while, too, just like some of the characters in these three films.
836;They worked along the way to help to make their journey.
837;George ended up finding his friend, Jim Lavrakas, a famous photographer today for the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska.
838;Christopher McCandless worked out in the fields cutting grain for a while to help pay his way.
839;I have a good friend named Phil who actually did do what I had once intended on doing myself.
840;He also wanted to be free and independent of his family, like Chris in INTO THE WILD.
841;It takes courage to live alone like Thoreau out in the wild.
842;There is no way to jam with other people and enjoy music and dance when you live alone out in the woods.
843;It's a wild world, as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care.
844;The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way.
845;It's almost as if one has to shed one's former identity as a snake sheds its skin in order to take on one's true identity .
846;and this requires the taking on of a new name, one which reflects one's true identity.
847;who is very sensitive and contemplative .
848;Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper.
849;One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish.
850;but riding on motorcycles!Another theme that runs deeply through all three films is the powerful and destiny changing power of rivers!
851;The awesome power of the natural world, exemplified by a river in all three films, is undeniable.
852;Still, the injustice of the moment is profound, as one watches Peter Fonda's motorcycle go up in flames while Roger McGuinn of the Byrds sings Bob Dylan's song, The Ballad of Easy Rider,' as the lyrics flow, river flow repeat throughout the song like the flowing river itself.
853;Society itself can be in great need of a social healer.
854;On doing so, he once and for all proved to his friend, Alberto, that he was no wimp but a true man with determination and courage.
855;He showed an inner strength that inspired all of those around him.
856;How they cheered his victory over the river!
857;His nobility still shines brightly!
858;Like Alexander Supertramp in INTO THE WILD and Captain America in EASY RIDER, he had a huge heart and a great soul.
859;He truly cared about people.
860;Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 .
861;His sense of loss and isolation is profound.
862;His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him.
863;All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.
864;one last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals .
865;bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer.
866;We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.
867;coming from this bookish, sensitive doctor!Ultimately, what one comes away learning from all three of these films, and which is expressed at the end of INTO THE WILD by Christopher McCandless, is that what really matters most in life is true happiness and peace of mind, and that the only way to be truly fulfilled and happy is by sharing it with other people.
868;Happiness can only be found in community.
869;To reach a real community where you can truly be yourself and live an authentic life is a real blessing.
870;Only Ernesto reached the higher octave of societal existence and sustained a life on a higher level of community involvement through his unbending will and indomitable spirit to work for the good of the whole, as my friend, Al, likes to say.
871;He was true to himself
872;He found true freedom from the fold by transforming the fold itself, and it was life on the road that transformed him.
873;thoreau said it best: In wilderness is the preservation of the world.
874;This is a great older movie.
875;This one is a real classic.
876;Combine that with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper (deceased) you have an excellent movie.
877;Watch the film for yourself.
878;It takes you into the life of some characters you don't know, makes you see it their way and kills them off for no reason other than prejudice.
879;Normal people see freedom and it makes them scared.
880;fair to say Denis Hopper gets it relatively close!Thanks to the seller for providing us the product we paid for.
881;Best looking blu ray transfer I have ever seen,
882;Peter FONDA was never a good actor but one will still enjoy this old movie, not having seen it before i was startled at the ending
883;This is a classic that I cant live without.
884;Still one of the best buddy/anti.
885;Did'nt have much of a story line and I didn't think the acting was all that great.
886;It is a great movie.
887;But what I wanted to talk about is the added documentary Easy Rider: Shaking The Cage.
888;I loved this documentary and have watched it about 10 times.
889;Peter Fonda and Hopper alone are just great and it is cool watching these guys now in their 60's talking about making this movie.
890;Not surprisingly, his portrayal of Billy , the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's Wyatt is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.
891;filmed the year after the summer of love had ended, Rider is one of the few true portraits of the cultural landscape of that turbulent era.
892;The mellow Fonda always represents a generations quest for a simple kind of peace while Hopper, who also directed, is the fatal drive towards a futile end, always pulling away from the obvious path.
893;They ride their custom choppers like two cowboys headed through the wild west.
894;Although a notoriously frazzled production, great performances (notably Jack Nicholson), and a supurb use of some of the great rock road anthems of the day help create something fascinating, if quite dated.
895;Of course, whether you lived the era or not, today the movie stands as a great historical representation of the mood of a country during one of America's strangest periods.
896;Cultural sign posts like this are rare.
897;Rarer still to be made by the ones who lived it.
898;I liked the movie for the lesson it should teach us all.
899;everyone should see this movie at least once.
900;Does give you a peak at 60s mentality.
901;So when I had a chance to watch it I decided to see what the fuss was about.
902;Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras.
903;Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson.
904;this movie really gets much more credit than it deserves but does offer some entertainment value.
905;hippies and motorcycles never really mixed well and this movie is an example.
906;the saving grace of the music is the music soundtrack.
907;Just remember it is from the 60's
908;For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.
909;Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.
910;but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it.
911;in an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot.
912;He confessed that Easy Rider is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization.
913;He's got the easy ride.
914;liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.
915;Seek and you will find.
916;The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.
917;With a soundtrack featuring If Six Was Nine by Jimi Hendrix, Weight by The Band, Born to Be Wild and The Pusher by Steppenwolf, and excellent performances by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper as well as Jack Nicholson, this film is a true masterpiece.
918;On the way, they make some new friends, one in particular named George Hansen played by Jack Nicholson, the lawyer with the ACLU.
919;Dennis Hopper won Best New Director at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this movie.
920;This movie also introduced the world to 3 time Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson.
921;The transfer is flawless, especially for a 60's film.
922;So, take it from me, a 16 year old film buff: This movie is a true classic, and a worthy addition for anyone's film collection.
