1;this is a masterpiece and portrays the subtle despair of wanting to let go of something that we really really love and just want to hold on.
2;an excellent performance and experience
3;Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are extraordinary in Leaving Las Vegas.
4;Cage received an Oscar and Shue got a much.
5;derserved nomination for best actress.
6;I have always admired and liked Shue, she is a real and talented actress, she is good in every role even if it is a crummy movie.
7;Cage's performance just blew me away, I knew he could act in Peggy Sue got Married but this is best and most appreciated role.
8;They have amazing chemistry, they are electrfying together.
9;Director Mike Figgis did a wonderful job, the opening credits and the musical score are fantastic.
10;Leaving Las Vegas can be hard to watch but this is real and important film.
11;One of my favorite dramas of all.
12;It is a reverse fairy tale, a purely fictional account of the ravages of depression, addiction, and desperation.
13;You must leave the experience happy!
14;You must walk out of that theater feeling strong and in control!
15;These characters found happiness, if only for a brief while, why can't you.
16;There is hope!An excellent script portrayed by excellent actors and shot by a director who put his soul into the piece.
17;To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on.
18;Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer.
19;It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone.
20;It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance.
21;This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love.
22;Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the classic love.
23;story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own.
24;Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love.
25;This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone.
26;While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love.
27;All the elements are present.
28;Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe.
29;These two are in love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.
30;Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal.
31;For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forego her independence and be with Ben.
32;She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben.
33;Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls.
34;While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that Love is a very splendid thing.
35;The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood.
36;Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart.
37;It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre.
38;While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.
39;overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.
40;this is one of my favorite movies.
41;The characters are so dynamic and engaging.
42;Director Figgis deserves deification for this effort.
43;If you're intelligent and like finding meaning instead of having it spoon fed to you, I recommend this film.
44;Elizabeth is in fine form for this film.
45;Some very good visuals of her in this film which I highly recommend.You are able to sympathize with both Ben and Sera, despite the paths they have chosen.
46;Nicholas Cage was amazing and brilliant.
47;No wonder why he won an Academy Award for his performance.
48;Shue is also terrific in her role and should be applauded as well.
49;The two are explosive as a team and can really bring the house down.
50;The picture for the most part looks good
51;Leaving Las Vegas is heartbreaking, but at the same time is satisfying.
52;It's emotionally charged from start to finish.
53;She can help me through my alcoholism any time.
54;Great performance of Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue.
55;One of my favorite movies!
56;To me it is an exceptionally acted, intense, and romantic movie.
57;In a word, it is a work of art.
58;Nicholaus Cage's finest, darkest moment.
59;Great acting all the way around.
60;I found this movie both funny and sad.
61;I laughed at what a drunken [fool] the guy makes out of himself in public and at first I also found some humor in how much he drinks.
62;There, he meets and develops a close relationship with a prostitute Sera.
63;it was interesting how the two maintained a fairly strong relationship despite his insane drinking and the way she makes a living.
64;She, by the way, moved to Vegas because there's more money there for prostitutes.
65;Her job is risky enough, going into a room with an unknown man for sex.
66;But, for 200 bucks an hour untaxed at a self.
67;they call it love, and if it was, then it was love at first sight.
68;He was determined on his course.
69;I just want to say this right off the bat
70;There are just so many cinematic gems to be found within that particular year, and `Leaving Las Vegas' is truly one of them.
71;He is a very mannered, `actorly' type of an actor
72;I adored him in `Matchstick Men', a film that embellished his mannerisms and made them work to his advantage
73;`Leaving Las Vegas' is responsible, not only for Cage's finest performance, but is honestly his finest film
74;as a quick side point, that is another wonderful thing about the films of 1995
75;Films like `Leaving Las Vegas' and the overwhelmingly fantastic `Dead Man Walking' are able to crawl inside the viewer and grab hold of their beating heart with a realness and rawness that reflects real life and not Hollywood's overly saccharine fabrication of it.
76;He tells her his plan and warns her not to try and ask him to change, that he will never stop drinking, and she allows herself to comply because she needs to be with him, but as they come closer with one another her love for Ben starts to tear away at her commitment to him.
77;it feels weird for me to say this, but the strongest facet of this film is the acting.
78;Cage embodies Ben with such rawness and accuracy.
79;His shakes and stutters and tantrums are so real, so believable and ultimately so heart wrenching.
80;As good (or even great) as Cage is, Elizabeth Shue is a revelation.
81;The entire Oscar shortlist is beyond compare when stacked up against their usual picks for each and every performance nominated is worthy, even if I would replace one or two.
82;all of them are flawless and deserving of an Oscar (especially Shue and Sarandon) but there was Kidman in `To Die For' and even Silverstone in `Clueless' (such a fantastic comedic performance).
83;I mean really, 1995 is above and beyond stellar.
84;She is decent, but hardly ever mind blowing.
85;As Sera, Shue captures the fading light in her eyes that starts to shine brighter when she finds Ben.
86;She is used to having men `need' her in ways that degrade her, but Ben truly `needs' her and that truth fleshes out the real woman that is Sera.
87;Her performance is a true `tour.
88;force' if I ever saw one and unbelievable moving and touching.
89;The film is a tragic yet beautifully accurate representation of the disease that is alcoholism and the effect it has on a human spirit.

94;Their last moments together are tragic and quiet.
95;The two lead actors are outstanding.
96;Nicholas Cage is utterly convincing and revolting as a drunk.
97;Elisabeth Shue brings out a curious combination of dignity and helplessness in her protrayal of Sera, the more sympathetic of the two characters.

102;There is a very deep understanding and mutual acceptance between the two lead characters that is in many ways the true highlight of this movie.
103;'Leaving Las Vegas' is an iconoclastic love story whose control over the audience is fascinating.
104;Such is the brilliance of the performances that you feel a lump in your heart by the end of the movie .

132;Sera's love for Ben is reflected in the way she lets him complete his goal.
133;I see why so many people recommend it
134;Mike Figgis brought this touching ode to the night to the screen, imbuing it with the transient and tragic nature of those seduced and then swallowed up by it.
135;The director of Stormy Monday perfectly captures the sad yet often poetic beauty found in the shared loneliness of the night two souls in despair can find.
136;On his way down he meets a prostitute named Sera and in their spiraling despair they discover love.
137;One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when Cage is on the streets of Las Vegas seeking human contact and can't remember whether he lost everything because of his drinking or started drinking because he lost everything.
138;Cage's performance rings absolutely true and deservedly won him the Oscar.
139;He shows with great tenderness the sad realism of being an alcoholic.
140;matching Cage scene for scene is Elizabeth Shue in a brilliantly realized role that should have won an Oscar.
141;But when Ben finally pushes her away in order to save her, she realizes that if she lets him, she may very well lose this power to love and her connection to being human.

143;There is both truth and poetry here though for those who know this life.
144;Anyone who has ever been devastated by a loss and known a Sera or a Ben, or a combination of both in one, will be moved by this heartbreaking journey into loneliness and despair.
145;Figgis has made a masterpiece for all those who have walked away before the night swallowed them up completely and they were lost forever.

149;A full and detailed synopsis of this film can be found in any one of several reviews on this page, so I won't repeat it here.
150;one reviewer writes that this is an excellent example of unconditional love.
151;Elizabeth Shue's character, a high.
152;Give the film credit for showing each of them grappling with this, but in the end they wimpishly stick to their agreement to allow themselves to wallow in their pathetic circumstances.
153;It's fascinating to watch and scream at the characters to grow up and do something about their doomed lot in life, but only once.
154;I was shocked that Nicholas Cage actually won a Best Actor award for his performance in this film.
155;It moved me not because the movie was depressing, but because the love between Ben and Sera is something very few people will ever experience.
156;Real, compelling, Cage at his best.
157;This is a film any decent human being wants to hate.
158;I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling.
159;Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone.
160;But that moment, my god, wow.

171;The characters are realistically portrayed, and the story is excellent.
172;The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is exceptional (I'd rate it a 5, vice Amazon's 4), and the background music is both well.
173;If you have a 5 or 6 speaker Dolby Digital setup, you'll feel as if you're actually in the movie, with the jazz music and sound effects emanating from all around you.
174;Incredibly performed Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue will draw you in as they spiral to lows beyond what many of us can imagine.
175;Leaving Las Vegas is an Oscar winning movie that takes what should be repulsive material and spins it into gold.
176;The story is about an alcoholic who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and while there he forges a strong relationship with a prostitute.
177;Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for this role, and he really deserved it.
178;Sometimes he makes you laugh with his drunken antics, but often times you absolutely cringe.

180;She knows he is trying to kill himself, but she has to accept that.
181;The look on her face when she returns is so poignant.
182;I don't know if you've a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, but I thought maybe we could get some dinner.You have two extremely powerful performances here, Cage and Shue, or rather Ben and Sera, are two messed up people, but this is also a tender love story.
183;There is a lot of great jazz on the soundtrack, like for instance Sting does the ballads Angel Eyes and My One and Only Love.

200;I have personally revolved my life around the theme of this movie for the past two years.
201;Played by Nicolas Cage and Elizebeth Shue respectively, their characters are always authentic and are often rounded with heartwrenching emotion.
202;Cage won the Oscar for it, and I think so should have Shue.
203;There are sequences between the two so good that I dare not begin to describe them.
204;this film is more or less a remake of the classic Midnight Cowboy, with the added romantic edge.
205;There are hard scenes to take, but there are also great uplifting scenes, and nothing that happens in the end is really all that shocking.
206;This is just a great film of connection, love, and understanding, and everything inbetween.
207;I have been sober for the past 12 years, and have experienced a rebirth in myself, and I thank God for that every day of my life.
208;This was a powerful movie, and the director, and the performance by Nicholas Cage were able to evoke tears, trembling, cringing, anger, fear, and depression for days afterward, which might have caused my blood pressure to become elevated.
209;Yes, Nicholas Cage, and Elizabeth Shue played powerful, and undoubtedly emotionally draining roles for this movie.
210;i'm too intelligent to ever let that happen to me . . . Respect alcohol, it is more powerful than you.

216;Shue is still alive and has had this marvelous experience of not coming home to just mouth wash.
217;the truly stellar performances turned in by Cage and Shue are what make this story go even more than the story which is top.
218;The movie could have so easily turned into just a vile look at what humanity is capable of but the performances keep it alive and moving.
219;I give Cage's portrayal as an end of the road alcoholic 5 stars.
220;He deserved an Oscar for this movie.

226;I like Nicholas Cage and he is really good in this movie.
227;I am really big Cage fan and my opinion is this one of his greatest acting ever.
228;If you haven't seen this movie before and want to, go and get it right now.
229;LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a truly heartbreaking story about a man, determined to drink himself to death, and the hooker who falls in love with him.
230;One of the things that is great about the film is that it flips the plot and moral cards on us.
231;Normally in a film like this, the Prince Charming who saves the princess from her life of whoring is lifted up as the moral superior, brining life and love into the life of a hooker.
232;It is a wonderful reversal and I was happy to see it.
233;the film score is perfect for the movie.
234;The jazz music lends the film the romance and sadness that it needs.

262;The honesty in this dark movie is what makes it soar above any other film.
263;This film effortlessly makes you care so much for the characters because it presents them as flawed human beings who want nothing more than to feel love and to give love.
264;This movie is touched me so deeply because it was a visual representation of feelings of my own life when I am forced to drop my guard and examine my own life and person I truly am.

281;LEAVING LAS VEGAS is raw, brutal, and gutwrenching, yet poignant enough to allow the viewer to sincerely care about the two tragic characters.
282;LEAVING LAS VEGAS is an exceptional film.
283;Out of all the movies I have seen, this one is probably my favorite.
284;The acting is great (look at the difference between Elizabeth Shue's acting here and in The Hollow Man, it's like night and day, she is horrible in the Hollow Man but great in Las Vegas, the Hollywood phoney effect I call it).
285;This movie is real life and it is refreshing to see such a great movie get made and why didn't this movie win the Academy Award?
286;This is one of the rare occasions where I think this movie was actually better than the book.
287;So since neither character has any pretense, any ego, or anything really to lose, they are able to come together and love each other in a sincere and unconditional way.
288;There is love, pain, language, A surreal glimpse in the dark and light side of too many or too few peoples lives.
289;This movie as noted by many reviews is not a feel good but it is however amazing and a must see, *****.
290;But this is undeniably one of the greatest performances of the 1990's.
291;Elisabeth Shue also turns in a raving performance, as a Vegas call girl.
292;Along the way he meets a beautiful call girl by the name of Sera (Shue in her Oscar.
293;This movie works on many levels.

302;What's really astounding is how the two play the most .
303;with a heart of gold .
304;It's better viewed than it is described.
305;I guess you can't be all things to all people, and this movie is a good example.
306;I do know that when we lived in Illinois, my wife and I must have watched the film fifteen times together.
307;While Las Vegas has plenty of openings for Boulevard of Broken Dreams, as any large city does, it's still a rollicking fun town to live in.
308;Since this film covers human emotion big time, and wrings you out like a dishrag by the time it's over, I would classify it as art, and very good art.
309;In fact, it's one of the most brilliant scenes ever shot that uses nudity.
310;She comes up with the brilliant idea that maybe if she becomes the booze herself, he will finally get the idea.
311;based on what both lead actors have done before and since, this film will probably be considered the high.
312;water mark of both of their careers.
313;They got what they put into life, and much of the time, you're lucky to get even that.
314;A good price, here when promised, arrived in good shape.

316;Sad ending to this awe driven movie.
317;His system of care became believing to knowing that his symptoms were going to kill him and held on to the hope of knowing that Sera would not leave him.
318;i really enjoyed this movie.
319;This Oscar winner works on two main levels.
320;The first is Cage's portrayal of an unapologetic drunk who realizes that he is trying to kill himself with alcohol.
321;He won the Academy Award that year and deservedly so.
322;I love the Las Vegas emphasis.
323;But Nicolas Cage is making the best performance of his long career, and I say 'Thank You' to him and the film makers.
324;Cage vaults to the level of Al Pacino on this one.
325;I loved the opening, it really sets up Cage's charactor.
326;A film worth seeing, but in moderation.
327;Elezabeth Shue is always good, but Cage was pathatic.
328;found it on the sidewalk.
329;crappola plus,thats why it got one star.
330;It is, many critics and fans say, a story of unconditional love.
331;It is also one of the most profoundly overrated films to emerge from 1990s Hollywood.
332;they are actually remarkably good in their roles.
333;This movie is a very good drama about two people who are suffering under the affliction of their life styles and become best friends and fall in love at the very end.
334;nicolas Cage gave a great performance in this movie.
335;elizabeth Shue was outstanding as always.
336;A moving experience of the cold reality of the state some people are reduced to.
337;A sterling performance by Cage Shue.
338;are why movies as genuinely moving as this one become rarer by the year.
339;Sera, whose behavior throughout the film manifests classic symptoms of the self.
340;selflessness, redemptive devotion, unconditional love .
341;An avowed alcoholic, Ben drank away his family, friends and, finally, his job.
342;On the strip, Ben picks up a street.
343;smart hooker named Sera in what might have been another excess in his self.
344;This is a thoroughly entertaining flic that I think I've seen more than a dozen times.
345;The direction and editing add immensely to the production.
346;Best role for Nicholas Cage.
347;Elizabeth Shue was extraordinary .
348;he has one goal, to drink himself into oblivion, and she see's something about him enough to help him cope with his serious depression, only to fall in love with him.
349;Good plot (which saves the movie), acting is good, and photography so, so, but is entertaining.
350;Cage's work is really superior.
351;Sera felt empathy with Ben and the love story began with their understanding and acceptance for each other.
352;Even though Sera might have taken Ben to hospital for diagnosis and treatment etc., she didn't, the reason is that Ben's will is always her top priority.
353;I'm amazed at Sera's altruistic mind and realized what true love is.
354;the film applies a sentimental approach to protray this tangible love story.
355;It's like a reflection of the modern society.
356;And let's appreciate how the flow of the movie is managed by means of music and cinematography.
357;the film is suitable for everyone, especially right now we're dealing with despair under the global economic recession.
358;a very bold film that inevitably recalls us the eternal beacon in the darkness: Billy wilder 's Lost weekend with Ray Milland (a winner too), Blake Edwards ` Days of wine and Roses with Jack Lemmon (a nomination , he lost with Peck) and finally that jeweled film of the early sixties, Le feu follet (Fire within) with Maurice Ronet and directed by Louis Malle.
359;notch punch, and so show us the analogy of the contraries.
360;I, on the other hand, found it to be so well.
361;acted, and so intense, it really took my breath away.
362;One of my top favorite movies.
363;I have never seen a movie that shows somebody's problem and addiction in such a round and honest way.
364;With both Cage and Shue, these were the performances of a lifetime.
365;This was a very daring and original film.
366;Its R rating is well.
367;good movie of the year at all.
368;It is just an incredible film with very depressing elements.
369;I give it five stars for the performances, the dialogue, the directing, the makeup, and the film as a whole.
370;Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue give great performances.
371;The directing is excellent, but it's the story you will keep coming back to.
372;Makes me appreciate my life.
373;This movie is one of the best displays of genuine addiction and codependency.
374;Great to show in substance abuse groups or to watch for entertainment, well acted.
375;This movie paints a great potrait of an extreme alcholic.
376;It is the type of movie that you watch and think about the rest of the day.
377;This movie works on so many levels.
378;A great movie, the girl from coctails topless, and a insane drunk.
379;It has all the makings of a masterpiece.
380;The most ridiculous part is that he won an oscar!
381;They respect each others life styles.
382;Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue pretty much give up on life.
383;Like I said I liked Elizabeth Shue's acting and the story line was somewhat decent.
384;worth checking out no doubt about it but I personally thought HollyWood pumped this movie up way too much, and hyped Nicholas Cage's role as Stunning, or amazing.
385;Cage and Shue are both raw and complex, the soundtrack is lush, the photography is meaningful, the script is almost irrelevant as the actors are giving everything they have.
386;Cage just nails his role, and so does Elisabeth Shue.
387;In the midst of the dark underbelly of Los Vegas, two broken people find love.
388;Filmed on a shoestring by Figgis, who also contributed the haunting jazz score, Vegas is a fearlessly downbeat love story about desperation and despair that was rapturously received at the box office in 1995.
389;Cage won an Oscar for his gritty, go.
390;broke portrayal of the suicidal Ben, and Shue made the leap from TV's Melrose Place to the big screen with her convincingly raw, Oscar.
391;I found this film very hard to watch.
392;finally, Sera realises something about Ben.
393;She asks him to seek help.
394;cage puts in a truely outstanding performance as Ben.
395;He really is totally convincing.
396;the final reason that the film is so compelling is the source material.
397;Excellant performances by both Nick Cage and Elisabeth Shue.
398;Mike Figgis direction of this video was superb and kept the viewer in tune and kept the flim on an pace perfect for the story.
399;Always keeping the viewer interested in the developing plot.
400;Also the soundtrack for the flim really help set the mood and made the flim much more emotional for the viewer.
401;Sting also lends his help to a few tracks during the movie.
402;Overall this was a great movie, having not only a great story but also top notch directing as well as acting.
403;It confirms what I have always thought: no matter what, the bottom line is that a human being is essentially love, and life revolves around it.
404;ben's mind boggling drinking may seem too excessive, a expressway to death, but there is so much you can fit into a movie.
405;Cage's interpretation is real, yet giving him an Oscar for that remains questionable.
406;sera's performance as a hooker brought .
407;once again, yet with an astonishing evidence .
408;Sue's acting is a masterpiece of profound conflict between business at any cost (the executive at the bar counter and the rape from the football players)and the real, love thirsty and sensitive Sera.
409;But as a message (and all real movies should convey one), it would be healing to see, even without an happy.
410;end, that those disturbed beings could return to Life through Love.
411;elisabeth Sue deserved an Oscar for her amazing, beautiful, sensible and shattering interpretation.
412;The screenplay, direction, and fabulous performances make this film worth 5 stars!
413;the story in a shot glass: An out of control alcoholic (Ben) hits bottom, decides move from LA to Las Vegas to commit slow suicide, but finds love and some closure to his life when he meets Sera.
414;Sera is a street wise yet hopelessly co. dependent (first to her abusive pimp, then to Ben) hooker, who finds a glimpse of self worth when she learns to love and receive it in return.
415;Sort of a gritty, street smart Beauty and the Beast but without the fairy tale ending.
416;cage is outstanding as Ben, the alcoholic in the hopeless, final stages of his disease.
417;Cage's Best Actor Academy Award is well deserved, but Shue is even better (she got robbed by not winning also).
418;The pain showing behind the smiles she forces seems completely real, as she watches Ben slowly kill himself.
419;while others described the ending as depressing (it is), there is closure
420;If you lean more toward American Beauty or Fight Club, this is a must for your collection.
421;now I actually help others who are in bondage to alcoholism, and show them how I found the way true way out through Christ!
422;He has a way of commanding the screen and drawing you into his deeper self.
423;The people he portrays always seem to be touchable and real.
424;But it is also a movie about 2 people finding happiness, even though it is short lived, in this crazy world.
425;I have always said that a minute of happiness is worth more than a day of dispair.
426;all in all I liked this movie and would recomend it to anyone who likes movies with a deeper meaning.
427;I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
428;He falls love with a prostitute, she loves him too.
429;Right up my alley love it hope it happens to me.
430;I also had a fascination with prostitutes and so, you see, I was fooled by the two main characters.
431;I thought it was a really good movie.
432;There's your noble sacrifice to ease your infinite pain.
433;She decides she loves the man who wants to die so bad that he drinks an insane amount.
434;all you people calling this film beautiful or honest, please explain a) why these characters can be believed AT ALL, and b) what is beautiful about suicide and apathy.
435;please everyone, wake up to the realizty of movies like this.
436;Physically beautiful characters combined with nice cinematography, stirring music, plus titillating scenes do NOT equal a beautiful creation.
437;Their chemistry mixes wonderfully and you come away, feeling like the proverbial fly.
438;wall, experiencing everything with them.
439;ray before we can take the Blu.
440;A great look into the soul of addiction and desperation.
441;Seen it several times now.
442;Cage and Shue are great in this flick.
443;I generally steer away from a Disney movie.
444;But I also draw the line at 100 million dollar films that want to tell me that life is hard.
445;Human courage in the face of adversity.
446;This film is a masterpiece.
447;It is a comedy with the hilarity of any Police Academy number ever made.
448;It is a weepie with soul but still suitable for men.
449;this film stars an actor who within his career was defined to no brainers like Con Air and The Rock but no doubt about it this film is an exception, in this he is excellent as the alcholic Ben Sanderson, who after being fired he decides to go to Viva Las Vegas to drink himself to death .
450;This actor is teamed up with Elisabeth Shue who also excels herself, she is the prostitute who decides to find love in the mild.
451;She is perfect for the role as Sera, and after mishap after mishap after mishap, even one where she is raped by a gang of 'college jocks' (anal intercourse involved .
452;It is original therefore making it even more interesting.
453;and if you haven't figured it out by now the actor is Nicholas Cage and he proves in this film that he can act properly, he deserved his best actor oscar I think although he did have competiton from The Usual Suspects so I suppose he was lucky.
454;But even with this competiton it deserves a five star for its superb acting, soundtrack (by sting) and for its simply manificent presence on screen.
455;This is a touching movie that looks at real life issues.
456;The movie is not for kids but is very entertaining.
457;Leaving Las Vegas is completely itself and whole, a masterpiece of filmmaking when you consider the challenges and circumstances of its production.
458;Cage's Ben is a fantastic piece of work.
459;That is what makes this movie special.
460;Even when the characters go through the motions of sentimentality, and sincerely so, the stark truth is always in the room e. g. as Sera sheepishly prepares a meal of vegetables and plain rice, Ben zombie walks into the kitchen to the fridge and walks out clutching two!
461;There is no pleasure here.
462;Its a well acted movie about a sad man's downward spiral who actually fines a small taste of happiness.
463;Elizabeth is delightful and gloriously seductive
464;that being said, Leaving Las Vegas truly is a fantastic movie.
465;nicholas Cage was absolutely incredible in this film.
466;Throughout the entire movie his character was drunk and Cage portrayed this character with as much talent as the world's best actors.
467;Leaving Las Vegas is by far his best movie.
468;The female lead role is also somone you wont relate to.
469;Few movies will leave you with a deeper sense of gloom than this one.
470;the success of this story may lie in its simplicity.
471;His decision to drink his way to a swift oblivion is strangely understandable, though grim to watch.
472;packed well and arrived promptly.
473;This film has, by far, the wrost sound.
474;Nevertheless, its still a good film, despite the above.
475;As tragic as it is, this is a very beautiful and well.
476;done film that keeps your attention to the bitter end.
477;An unexpected bond is formed between the two and love falls upon them that can only end in tragedy.
478;You are able to sympathize with both Ben and Sera, despite the paths they have chosen.
479;Nicholas Cage was amazing and brilliant.
480;No wonder why he won an Academy Award for his performance.
481;Shue is also terrific in her role and should be applauded as well.
482;The two are explosive as a team and can really bring the house down.
483;The picture for the most part looks good
484;Leaving Las Vegas is drama at its best.
485;It's heartbreaking, but at the same time is satisfying.
486;It's emotionally charged from start to finish.
487;The writing is poetic, the acting is electric, and the directing is fantastic.
488;If you want a powerhouse drama that will keep you emotionally involved, this is the one for you.
489;A terrific and amazing film on every front.
490;i could go on and on but i wont, the facts are a) this is probably the most dramatic movie ever made and b) nic cage is the best actor on the planet.
491;holy smokes was he amazing in this and elisabeth shue is perfect by all standards.
492;good job all around tonite i decided this is my favorite movie.
493;which might last a week but it will remain top five forever.
494;Any time a film can do that, it's usually a pretty good sign.
495;There are scenes that at the end you'll be like oh.
496;Another film that does this to you is Requiem For A Dream.
497;the tart with a heart
498;grab an Oscar jury by the throat.
499;I can speak from experience.
500;it's a good reminder of where I came from.
501;I've seen this movie several times, but I'm sure I'll see it again.
502;Well, actually I can believe it after watching it based on the plot itself.
503;One of the finest films not only of the 90's independent spirit but in all of film history.
504;An original, brilliant, beautiful, and visceral film that will push your buttons like few others can.
505;Even though it ultimately portrays alcoholism as the dead end that it is (this story does not end happily), it is more complex than that, delving into those issues which concern us all: love, lonliness, despair, and hope.
506;Combined with incredible Jazz music, an original screenplay free of cliches, and unforgettable scenes, this is a movie you will not soon forget.
507;One of my top ten favourites and I have seen many thousands.
508;nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue are superb portraying their characters and their skill is the driving force of the film.
509;one particularly important aspect of the film is the relationship that forms between Cage and Shue.
510;The natural thing for both of them to do when they meet is to seek refuge in each other.
511;I'd recommend this film to anyone older than 17.
512;Nicholas Cage's performance in this film (that's film, not movie) is simply incredible.
513;He manages to perfectly capture the image of a drowning man on his willful downward spiral.
514;This by far is Nicolas Cage's best film ever!
515;It is a film that to this day I keep telling everyone that they need to watch.
516;It is so raw and the emotions are so real it reaches the depth of your soul.
517;Once you see it you will understand and appreciate this masterpiece of a classic!
518;It is NOT a very easy movie to watch, but it is worth at least seeing this movie once.
519;The Bottom Line:A pair of virtuoso performances and innovative direction help elevate this story from a simple story of boy.
520;girl to something far more profound and affecting
521;I found it to be one of the better movies out.
522;One of the best preformances by him.
523;He is truly one of my favorite actors.
524;One of the best movies in its class.
525;But best of all is the great directing and fantastic acting.
526;Leaving Las Vegas is one of those films that gets under your skin .
527;For Nicholas Gage this his tour de force performance .
528;he's simply briliant as is Elizabeth Shue in a heart wrenching performance that's equally brave and unforgettable.
529;well written, directed and deeply compelling .
530;Leaving Las Vegas is one of those films that leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.
531;This is excpetional story telling at it's best and a must see for most any film buff.
532;It's a watch alone movie or share it with your girlfriend or boyfriend
533;a trait that few people in life seem to master well, (even with people without the issues that the characters Ben and Sera have).
534;but the performances of Cage and Shue are incredible and touching.
535;It is a powerful movie which reflects true unconditional, albeit tragic, love.
536;He has vowed to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death.
537;One very powerful early scene, finds Ben downing a whole pint of booze in one shot at a bar and sinking into a hallucinogenic state.
538;The scene is filmed in a hazy blurriness that captures the moment perfectly.
539;They connect with one another and soon Sera finds herself becoming attached to Ben.
540;Mr. Cage and Ms. Shue are brilliant in their roles and both garnered much acclaim.
541;But as great as Ms. Shue is, this is Mr. Cage's film all the way.
542;He is a commanding presence on screen and gives one the best acting performances in the last twenty years.
543;For his troubles, he won the 1995 Best Actor Oscar.
544;Ms. Shue was nominated for Best Actress and Mr. Figgis gained two nominations, one for Best Director and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.
545;This film was a surprise and so far an anomaly for Mr. Figgis.
546;They start off as friends and she really wants to help him.
547;I liked this movie a lot because it is real and this happens to millions of people everywhere.
548;It makes you feel good about your life .
549;I saw this movie several times in the theatre and bought it when it came out on video.
550;I imagine that many people who enjoyed the movie could somehow relate to it, even if in an abstract way.
551;Nick Cage's portrayal of Ben, a man who has hit rock bottom and has lost his will to live, is incredibly powerful and moving
552;along the way he meets Sera, a prostitute, and seems to feel a personal connection with her.
553;Their bond becomes passionately deep and Sera gets attached to Ben emotionally.
554;Ironically, Ben is smitten with Sera, and he knows he could start a new life and love with Sera, were it not for the fate he has indomitably accepted.
555;although most people would judge and condemn a man like Ben in real life, I was very sympathetic to the character and his pain.
556;Ben has touched her in a way that no one has, and though at first she accepts Ben's death wish as a condition for their new relationship, Sera becomes conflicted about losing Ben.
557;this is a great movie with excellent performances from both its stars.
558;Just don't expect to walk away feeling hopeful or happy
559;Mike Figgis' Academy Award winning film still stands after 5 years as a truly remarkable and realistic film on the true accounts of a washed up screenwriter.
560;Shue as a prostitute meets up with Cage, an alcoholic, whom both live together to share their deteriorating lives.
561;Also there is a 'hidden feature' which when you do find it, you wont be happy to say its hidden, nor worth the while to make it so.
562;Roger Ebert thought it was the best film of 1995.
563;Out of sight, out of mind.
564;Some of the best works of art are all about suffering.
565;Oh, I got so turned on.
566;there are great dramas in the 1950's about alcoholics.
567;The audiences were entertained and possibly illuminated.
568;I enjoyed this movie, even though it had made me really thirsty at times.
569;I thought Nicolas Cage's acting was exceptional.
570;she's a decent actress, but are hookers really that hot?
571;The top part was almost up to her tits.
572;Overall the movie was great because I cared about the characters and wanted to watch the thing till the end, which is a rarity for movies these days.
573;Highly recommended for alcoholics and non.
574;Nicolas Cage is THE best.
575;Now of course that's just my opinion, but i feel strongly about it.
576;This is one of the most beautifully touching movies of all time.
577;You can tell that the Cage and Shue characters are really in love.
578;The love scenes, are very touching.
579;Cage is in top form for this film, and it shows.
580;THAT is pure dedication to acting.
581;If your idea of being entertained is to be brought as emotionally low as it is possible to feel, this is your perfect vehicle for getting there.
582;This is Nicholas Cage's best movie, he plays the role to perfection.
583;When I heard that someone had finally made a movie based on the Cheryl Crow hit I'm Leaving Las Vegas , I knew I had to see it.
584;destructive alcoholism is funny, then get ready to laugh your head off because that is what Nicolas Cage's character is all about.
585;Since most of the moving scenery were locals a good cross section of the communites were in the film, so the showings were sold out for the first few days.
586;Leaving Las Vegas is a terrific tragic story.
587;Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue play their parts extraordinary.
588;It could be because the musci was LOUD while the dialog was soft, but it really got on my nerves.
589;its just Nicholas cage at his best.
590;Hes funny when he's drunk.
591;Yes its dark but isnt that beautiful?Forget about the ending, the first 30 minutes is brilliant.
592;I could identify with parts of it, because we have alcoholism in our family.
593;I kept hoping for a miracle to happen.
594;But, Nicholas Cage did a fantastic job of acting!
595;It is kind of a tear jerker.
596;Well, Leaving Las Vegas is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
597;I was so impressed by it.
598;One of cinema's greatest love stories,which could follow in a line with True Romance,Badlands,Bonnie and Clyde,The People vs. larry Flynt and Show Me Love(which I haven't yet seen,but have a gut instinct about).
599;Leaving Las Vegas is a story about unconditional love.
600;the 'i'll accept you no matter what' kind of deal.
601;due to it's incredible realism.
602;but despite this,the couple find something in each other that is hard for us as outsiders to understand,but I couldn't help but feel somewhat touched by the way the relationship was acted out.
603;who moved me to tears more than once with his astounding performance as the drunk on a mission to drink himself to death but along the way,wins the hooker's heart.
604;A brief two words to sum up this movie as a whole.
605;Hard for anyone who hasn't been there to comprehend the horrors of an overpowering addiction
606;This is a great movie, its kind of a crazy yet intriguing yet disturbing movie.
607;Cage and Shue played great parts
608;I love both the leads and was instantly rapt with the subject matter.
609;This movie is very emotional and will leave you in tears by the end, however, it will cause you to think from beginning to end.
610;This may sound a little morbid, but this movie is uplifting to me and causes me to realize that life is better than it looks.
611;around for him and why it ever garnered Oscar attention.
612;Steer clear of this flick.
613;It will only frustrate you and deny you of your happiness.
614;Movies are an escape for most of us.
615;We enjoy the exhillaration of relating to the characters and blowing stuff up like Arnold or getting the girl like James Bond.
616;Extremely gritty and powerful film, with some amazing performances from the two leads.
617;It is also a film that pulls no punches, and is very raw and explicit .
618;Nicolas Cage's performance is his best to date, and to prepare for the role, he went binge drinking for two weeks while he had a friend videotape him to record his mannerisms and speech patterns.
619;I guess it paid off, because it's one of the most authentic and heartbreaking performances ever caught on film.
620;i guess you could say that this is one of my favorite films, and this is not because I find it entertaining.
621;I call it one of my favorites because it is so powerful that, every time I watch it, it stays with me for days.
622;and you are reminded that people like this do exist, that nobody is perfect, and that Christ loves these people just like he loves you and I. recommended for adults only.
623;This kind of movie is an acquired taste.
624;that said, every emotion in this film rang true forme.
625;it spoke right to the deepest part of the human condition.
626;this is a rare work of art that will outlast us.
627;If you are in love with an alcoholic, you should watch this movie.
628;sera is a beautiful person, she wants to live.
629;she takes Ben with her and she wants to take care of him.
630;i thought this was going to be a redemption movie.
631;my favorite type of movies.
632;great songs by him and the rest.
633;and in the end the love you take it's equal to the love you gave.
634;in the oscars, when Cage won, E. shue was there and she was very happy, waving her hands for him.
635;she deserved the oscar too, but then, Susan Sarandon made a great performance at Dead Man Walking .
636;5 stars for this masterpiece.
637;Many people misunderstand this movie.
638;I am not a Nicholas Cage fan by any stretch, but he owns my fullest respect in this insanely realistic performance.
639;Cage deserved that Academy Award for Best Actor x 10.
640;as for the movie itself, Leaving Las Vegas is wonderful piece of cinema.
641;A dark and depressing drama, that at times haunts the viewer, but nevertheless a remarkable movie.
642;As for the acting, well it is top notch.
643;Elizabeth Shue's acting was also very good, a big leap from Adventures in Babysitting, Cocktail and The Karate Kid.
644;I also enjoyed Julian Warlock Sands as the Latvian pimp, and why Richard Lewis was in this movie puzzles me as much as who's the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.
645;I find it interesting that Shue's character was ravishing, sophisticated, unpolluted, insightful and moral, for a prostitute.
646;Though if you want to see Nick Cage drinking his soul out and Liz Shue, a call girl with a heart.
647;Then this absolutely is the movie for you.
648;i did find an interesting conduit with this movie
649;I guarantee you will get it.
650;In The Karate Kid her name is Ally with an I. Therefore the name is Ali.
651;Leaving Las Vegas is a work of art.
652;This movie captures the nature and mentality of an alcoholic.
653;He captured the essence of an alcoholic and brought to life the struggle of a lost soul who has given up on life.
654;Elisabeth Shue also does an admiral job playing his love interest.
655;They both shined in this film, and I'm happy Nicholas won the oscar.
656;It was very accurate as to what truly happens to people living in those worlds!
657;This movie was incredible in all aspects, cinematography, acting, plot, etc.
658;Nicolas Cage's character exemplifies a unique view on life, and his involvement with Elizabeth Shue's character brings into question much of what we take for granted in life.
659;An excellent movie that I recommend to everyone.
660;This has to be one the best movies made in Hollywood.
661;The acting of both Cage and Shue is excellent without doubt.
662;The thing I don't understand about the film is what good does it bring to us.
663;This movie is inspirational in a dark sense.
664;Great acting performances all the way around.
665;Great acting and a movie you won't soon forget.
666;Well done movie with an especially engaging performance by Elizabeth Shue.
667;The script painted itself into a corner, in that any outcome more optimistic than the one we got would have been contrived, a happy ending for the sake of a happy ending.
668;This is a nicely executed picture of a pocket of spiritual and emotional pus, but it's a god.
669;wrought film that achieves an elegiac tone, one that stays with you for a while.
670;I have seen this movie many times and will watch it again.
671;Truly enjoy the acting (what happened to beautiful Elizabeth Shue?)
