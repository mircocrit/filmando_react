1;one of my top ten movies.
2;Steven Spielberg really gets carried away with himself here.
3;I read the book after seeing the film and I was quite pleased with how faithful the movie was.
4;I saw it with a friend who had studied Chinese history and was pretty skeptical about the movie before we saw it.
5;The transformation of the boy (Jim) into a man who is completely reduced to the bare ammorality of survival is stunning.
6;Jim's gradual slide into madness is amazing to see.
7;I really liked how his fascination with airplanes was portrayed in the movie and the aerial scenes had my hair standing up.
8;Raised with a silver spoon in his mouth, Jim has never really had to take care of himself.
9;Sure, Christian Bale and John Malkovich are good in the film.
10;He salutes the Japanese Kamikaze pilots and embraces a plane.
11;Yes, all of this is very interesting, but I the movie just didn't resonate with me.
12;overall, good movie, but not something I would really care to see again.
13;"The book might be interesting
I:8942;14;Steven spielberg, who was successful at only entertaining movies, has made a multilayered movie which has you thinking about it long after watching it.
I:8942;15;This is another Spielberg gem.
I:8942;16;I highly recommend this epic.
I:8942;17;For me, Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's masterpiece .
I:8942;18;a notch above Schindler's List and Amistad and several notches above anything else he has directed.
I:8942;19;It's a crime that the film took so long to garner a following"
20;All three films were made during the 1980's, when it was still possible to make films with huge casts (imagine the costs of filming something like this in Shanghai now!)
21;, and before the technologies of the 1990's rendered it easy and affordable to produce glitzy effects in virtual locations.
22;Empire of the Sun is what Hollywood (and Spielberg) can be and rarely is.
23;In addition, it contains one of the greatest performances in all of film by a child actor.
24;But note that for a few bucks more, amazon.
25;It was a great movie!
26;All together it was a good movie to learn about that time in history.
27;Spielberg takes a kid actor and holds you tightly for a wild trip.
28;A must see for any film buff.
29;"With ""Empire Of The Sun"", Steven Spielberg built the foundations for his best movie to date ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg took the strongest points in ""Empire Of The Sun"", for example: excellent music, outstanding cinematography, great set designs, remarkable performances (Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson), so it's fair to say that ""Empire Of The Sun"" gave to Spielberg a lot of experience for subsequent productions."
30;As the film moves along, Jamie gets more experience, bravery and intelligence, an excellent performance by Christian Bale I must say (perhaps his best yet).
31;"other actors shine in ""Empire Of The Sun"", John Malkovich is the standout, although there are other big names like Joe Pantoliano and Miranda Richardson (Ben Stiller appears briefly)."
32;This is a great movie.
33;The acting from all the cast is very good.
34;The direction of Spilberg is also great.
35;Bale was showing from a young age, that he would be a good emotional actor.
36;I always tear up at the ending scene.
37;the transfer of this movie to blu ray is very good.
38;Great movie to watch as a family with kids 10 years or older.
39;"scenes featurette for Saving Private Ryan, director Steven Spielberg admits he has an ""obsession"" with World War II."
40;ranging from the comedy 1941 to the Oscar.
41;long fascination with the Second World War.
42;the story is told from the point of British schoolboy Jamie Graham (Christian Bale), a well.
43;At the turn of the 20th century, the West's imperial powers had carved out sectors of Shanghai and transformed them into small, self.
44;screenwriter Tom Stoppard adapts Ballard's novel quite faithfully, and Spielberg's directorial talents carry us along Jamie's journey from the streets of Shanghai to the confines of a Japanese internment camp for civilian prisoners.
45;The December 1941 sequence is terrifying and technically challenging, while the Kamikaze Dawn scene is awe.
46;In this amazingly beautiful scene, Jamie .
47;The most precious assest of this film is that, the world was seen entirely through the eyes of young Jim Graham, who was wonderfully player by Christian Bale (and I can't believe I actually thought Haley Joel Osment is the only great child actor), and it definitely benefited from not taking any sides, but subtly pace out the transformation of Jim.
48;"provoking"" and ""deep and meaningful"", seldom offers as much humanity as this one."
49;Without the thrills and high.
50;techs, this is Speilberg at his best, and I only hope to see the great director tops it, even though it will be a tough task.
51;see movie for anyone who cares about great film making.
52;Have seen this movie several times and everytime find it to be one of the most wonderful movies ever ever.
53;This is an awesome movie and I have been trying to find it for a long time.
54;I love and adore this movie and will keep it forever.
55;this is Christian Bale as a child actor and he is AMAZING!So funny to hear people call Spielberg a God now.
56;John Malkovich is Christians co. star and he is incredible as well!!
57;The acting and the directing transform this story into an unforgetable movie.
58;Stephan Spielberg's scenes are great!
59;I am enjoying the movie!
60;"From a reviewer who cannot stand Steven Spielbergs'over sentimentalized trashing of history
I:8942;61;From beginning to end it is moving and well told.
I:8942;62;A slice of history that needs telling.
I:8942;63;Incredible performances, especially by John Malkovich.
I:8942;64;A must film to see.
I:8942;65;In parallel, there comes high class British rich people, and the usual greedy Americans.
I:8942;66;I recommend this movie to anyone.
I:8942;67;this is an Amazing Movie incl, a very young Batmans Christian Bale.
I:8942;68;For some reason there is a huge circle of film snobs (cinaphiles, movie buffs) who absolutely hate this film.
I:8942;69;Yes, even the vilest of movie critics"
70;the film tells the story of young Jamie Graham, a twelve.year.
71;He was able to capture the youth within his character, and, while making him mature he never lost it.
72;"Most young actor's today struggle with finding that balance between youth and maturity
I:8942;73;so, there is much to love here, even aside from Bale's dynamic performance.
I:8942;74;There are some very strong supporting performances by the likes of John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano, and there is a beautifully sincere and moving performance given by Miranda Richardson who was robbed of more screen time.
I:8942;75;Malkovich is very hit or miss for me, but here he lands a strong hit as the devious yet genuine Basie.
I:8942;76;Joe plays Frank, Basie's right hand man, and he demonstrates a believable mix of frustration and jealousy.
I:8942;77;She sadly only has a small amount of screen time, but she uses it to the full, delivering a very well rounded and complete performance, one that spans emotional terrain with effortless ease and comfort.
I:8942;78;and then there is the gorgeous cinematography provided by Allen Daviau.
I:8942;79;His steady hand helps add so much depth to emotional impact provided by each frame.
I:8942;80;This can be a good thing, but it can also be a slightly awkward thing.
I:8942;81;While it worked beautifully in the later film, it seems to take away from the grit of a film of this nature.
I:8942;82;so, with that said, I can recommend this film without hesitation.
I:8942;83;It really is enjoyable and it sports a brilliant performance by Bale (where is his Oscar?)
I:8942;84;This has always been Spielberg's underdog movie.
I:8942;85;This movie has stunning cinematography.
I:8942;86;Great for WW2 buffs as well to have a better understanding of the impacts of the WAR in Asia.
I:8942;87;But you can see from this film that the boy had major talent even then.
I:8942;88;that the American boy and the Japanese soldier, despite the battle around them, found time to develop a friendship (very interesting) given the history between the Americans and the Japanese at the time.
I:8942;89;Fortunately, every other aspect of the movie is breathtaking.
I:8942;90;This is one of Spielberg's best movies, which wonderfully depicts the harshness of the War with Japan through the eyes of a young child.
I:8942;91;The cinematography is wonderful .
I:8942;92;Combined with this we have an excellent screenplay and moving music .
I:8942;93;Chopin and the beautiful choral scene of the young lad singing in the choir.
I:8942;94;This is a classic historically.
I:8942;95;the cars were beautiful, I mistakenly thought the Packard was a Rolls!
I:8942;96;model fighters, good flying scenes.
I:8942;97;/ Richard and Arlene Norman(born in 1932"
98;This movie is unbelieveably amazing!
99;Once again, Steven Spielberg uses the brilliant technique of telling a story through the eyes of a young, simple boy (played by the wonderful Christian Bale).
100;The photography is amazing too.
101;This film provides a primer on how to perceive the events (good and bad) that occur in this world using metaphors.
102;Perpetually, I've considered Steven Spielberg the best director ever because of his ability to create masterpieces in any genre he wishes to dabble in.
103;There is a lot of similarities in both films.
104;Of course, the cinematography in Empire of the Sun is top.
105;All in all, Empire of the Sun is a wonderful David Lean type of a picture.
106;Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him.
107;The novel Empire of the Sun by J. g. Ballard is considered by some the best British novel ever made about WWII.
108;The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because the film looks wonderful.
109;Saw this movie years ago.
110;Enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed it the first time.
111;Would recommend it to other people.
112;Movie night with a friend and a good story.
113;Christian Bale pretty amazing but characters seemed a bit extreme to be believable Early Speilberg with a lot of crimson shots.
114;Empire of the sun is a tru masterpiece.
115;Christian Bale delivers one of the best child actor performences in the history of cinama.
116;This is an excellent movie, well performed, about growing and learning to understand the world in all its glory and sorrow.
117;By the end, you g Jim shows us that wisdom and age do not necessarily go hand in hand, as he becomes someone he can be proud while recognizing that the man he thought he Admired was not worth his time.
118;This was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
119;John Malkovich comes in second in his believable job coming and going in a young British boy, Jim Graham's life.
120;The film takes place in China when the Japanese invade and changes the lives of many, especially young Jim Graham.
121;He will eventually be put into an internment camp and survive in his own way.
122;The most moving scene in the film is when he discovers the American aircraft flying over the camp and Christian Bale does a SUPER job that should have at least given him an Academy nomination performance.
123;He didn't get it but after 20+ years Christian will receive an Academy Award.
124;The movie is also well made.
125;An often overlooked Steven Spielberg opus, this wonderfully enthralling account of J. g. Ballard's semi.
126;autographical novel of a British boy in Japanese occupied China, makes it a must see.
127;With riveting performances by John Malkovich and a very young Christian Bale.
128;"`People will do anything for a potato'When I think about the films of Steven Spielberg, ""Empire of the Sun"" ranks among my all."
129;time favorites by this director.
130;"there's so much to take in here, from the story and acting to the sets and cinematography that ""Empire of the Sun"" is also one of my all."
131;set during World War II, the story centers around Jamie, a boy from a well.
132;he's spoiled and takes advantage of those charged with his care.
133;you see all the wear and tear the aircraft went through.
134;"Color(check out the ""costume party"" scene) and contrast and sound are excellent."
135;One of Steven Spielberg's best movies that wasn't that successful when introduced in theaters.
136;ray, it's finally achieving the recognition it deserves.
137;so I'll defer to previous positive reviews.
138;Most of these reviews are written far better than I would.
139;the one thing I will add was how impressed my wife and I were with the young Christian Bale!
140;He's in almost every scene, and is absolutely brilliant.
141;A natural actor at such a young age.
142;I remember saying to my wife that this young man was going to be a superstar one day, if he decided to continue acting.
143;A win for him and a win for me!
144;while I am not an expert on Mr. Spielberg and his works, I have often wondered if this was one of his first true attempts to move from entertaining his audience to perhaps influence and educate them.
145;You must remember this movie was produced just before his critically acclaimed movies such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan which he released just a few short years later.
146;So while this movie isnt as popular or as well known, I have often wondered if it was laying the ground work within Mr. Spielbergs creative mind for those later movies.
147;For some reason, this show always caught my attention .
148;and when I finally got to see it online, I discovered why.
149;It told a story, based on a true story, of a boy's experience in a historical circumstance that I hadn't learned about yet .
150;Being a Spielberg film, the direction and cinematography are, of course, stunning.
151;Great effort was put into making this film appear realistic and it works wonderfully.
152;Empire Of The Sun successfully shows us glimpses of the brutalness of war but it also allows us to keep a constant feeling of hope and determination.
153;He makes the viewer feel what he feels.
154;There is an amazing amount of passion in his performance.
155;Please do yourself a favor and see it as well!
156;Just read a few of the reviews for this Spielberg opus, and amgratified that so many have found a place in their hearts for this special movie.
157;A comparison worth noting: both Private Ryan and Empire depict a search/quest against the panaramic sweep of the greatest war ever fought.
158;For Tom Hanks, it's his singular mission to find and bring back alive the last surviving son of a family of four young soldiers.
159;Christian Bale is magnificent and unforgettable in Steven Spielberg's memorable yet slightly flawed tale of lost innocence and maturity gained through tragedy.
160;The raw coming of age tale of a aristocratic child growing into a somber and mature young man is a powerful denoucement of WWII and the attrocities committed during all wars.
161;John Malkovich again plays a memeorable antagonist, and John Williams complements Spielberg's direction with a melancholic score.
162;The film's searing first person perspective of the boy's instantanous losses and continuous attempts to stay alive add a forebodding intensity which is reminescent of Spielberg's best work.
163;Though the film has some narrative and pacing issues, Empire of the Sun presents a dramatic flare that Spielberg eccentuates in later masterpieces Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.
164;A very good film and a shining hint at thing to come.
165;Watch this film for a good cry.
166;A very good WW11 Movie depicting a young boys experiance of war in the fareast during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai.
167;Every bit as good as Saving Private Ryan but on a more intimate level.
168;Christian Bale should have won an Oscar for his remarkable film debut.
169;John Williams's score is one of his best ever, too.
170;is as powerful as any ever filmed.
171;It is a very moving and touching movie.
172;It was good for them to see what this young boy went through because he didn't listen to the instructions given him by his mother.
173;I am purchasing it because my children still talk about how good it was and I want my grand children to see it.
174;One of the best war movies with a child actor I have ever seen.
175;Great story line, great acting, amazing scenery.
176;This is the best movie of war, by Spielberg, better than Ryan Soldier or Schindler's List.
177;Pay special attention on sound, long silence moments and the soundtracks!
178;This film is, in my opinion, one of Spielburgs best.
179;the true story is moving and heartfelt.
180;in my top 20 fav' films.
181;Bale's performance was so exceptionally superior to anything I'd ever seen by any actor!!!
182;The entire movie was mesmerizing, and I thought the story was told very elegantly and sensitively.
183;The movie as a whole was beautiful, but Spielberg was able to draw stellar performances from the entire cast, especially the young Christian Bale.
184;wrenching that I tear up just thinking about it.
185;hard Christian Bale fan, and it proved that, even though not all Steven Spielberg movies are big money makers, it still takes a great director to tell a beautiful story!
186;Steven Spielberg has made great, entertaining movies, yet many seem to promote a particular comic book.
187;Christian Bale plays the young boy and does a phenomenal job doing so.
188;Empire of the Sun is a breathtaking experience.
189;Based upon and faithful to English author J. g. Ballard's brilliant novel of the same name, EOTS details Ballard's childhood adventures as a prisoner of the Japanese in occupied China.
190;EOTS overflows with stunning images: Young Jim, dressed like a Turkish dandy, blunders into a company of armed and dangerous Japanese soldiers.
191;A midnight air attack on distant Japanese fortifications, seen from the safety of his internment camp barracks, becomes for Jim a vision of wonder and beauty.
192;Christian Bale as Jim, and John Malkovich), scoring, editing.
193;One of the great movies.
194;A young Christian Bale is brilliant in this movie, making this one of my top 5 favorites.
195;The transformation of a hateful and bratty little kid to a highly efficient and intelligent (as well as some.
196;what traumatized) young man with a better understanding of what the real world is actually like and what it takes to survive is absolutely shocking as well as stunning to watch.
197;This movie sticks with you and leaves a lasting impression that will change the way you view your world long after the movie ends.
198;I lived through this era and this protrayal of a young mans struggles and adaptation to the complex and powerful forces and activities of the adult world enveloping his young life was extremely well done.
199;Such a great movie that shows courage under the most uncertain circumstances!!
200;I loved this movie since I was 8.
201;this is a true story of a child seperated from his family during world war 11.
202;this is a very heart.
203;A story about the separation of a British family living in Shanghai, China during the Japanese invasion of China.
204;One of best movies out there.
205;Whenever I'm asked what my favorite movie is , I'll almost always put this in the top 5.
206;this is a riveting and heartwrenching story of a spoiled and naive English boy caught in one of the most explosive and confusing frontlines in WWII (Shangai, China).
207;I will say however that the cinematography, music, acting, and set design are some of the best I've ever seen.
208;Loved this movie the first time I saw it.
209;Suffice to say the film is amazing, it was nominated for several Academy Awards, but took home zero .
210;Spielberg considers this film one of his most profound.
211;ray is stunning to say the least.
212;There are also some stunning shots in and around the prison camp and airstrip.
213;The sound is also well updated and will give your sound system a workout.
214;Interesting, but self appreciative to say the least.
215;But I suspect the price will drop, as usual with the major studio Blu.
216;I remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it was first released.
217;I thought for sure this young kid deserves an Oscar.
218;Highly recommend this film for not only its acting, but also the photography and music score.
219;The young Bale delivered a brilliant performance as the irrepressible privileged schoolboy living in Shanghai, during the Japanese occupation of WW II.
220;As this was Christian Bale's first feature film, although he has developed into a mature and versatile actor, this particular performance, in my opinion, is simply magnificent and unforgettable, deserving of an academy award and really should have been acknowledged more so than it actually was back in 1987.
221;john Malkovitch as Basey, the charismatic American con man who teaches the young Jim the rules of the street and how to survive, delivered a stellar performance, as he is that type of character we don't want to like but cannot help liking despite his many shortcomings.
222;amazingly, this film is just under twenty years old, and it was a pleasure to watch again, particularly the realistic street scenes, when the city was conquered and occupied by the Japanese.
223;There are some impeccable shots in this film .
224;I believe Spielberg was aiming for the epic grandeur of a David Lean film, such as Laurance of Arabia or a Doctor Zhivago, and to my mind he achieved it.
225;there was a controversy when the film first hit the theatres back in 1987, and that was young Jim's respect and awe for the Japanese pilots.
226;The famous scene when they arrive at the camp and the John Williams soundtrack movingly transpires as magical sparks and light explode behind the Japanese plane like a holy vision.
227;spiritual experience seeing the plane, as the Japanese pilots salute him, perceiving the little boy's awe and respect.
228;He loves planes and the romance of being a fighter pilot.
229;"As a child, his allegiance is to the ""ideal"" of flying, and not to any nationality."
230;This is a highly moving film about courage, tenacity, resourcefulness and hope.
231;Thank you for the speedy service.
232;Jim sees beyond the difficulty, the politics and the conditions and maintains optimism and further, a dream which makes him one of the shining lights in the camp.
233;jim manages to hold onto a dream of a better life in the prison camp due to its proximity with a major airfield.
234;"He gives the film time and space, and the score from John Williamson is excellent
I:8942;235;how the director of a piece of rubbish like """"Saving Private Ryan"""" could have earlier directed a film as restrained, as underplayed, as subtle and as brilliant as """"Empire of the Sun"""" is beyond me!If you liked relationship style, character based, era evoking films such as """"The Thin Red Line"""", """"Cinema Paradiso"""" and """"Shawshank Redemption"""" then this one is for you."""
236;It's one of the best movies i have ever seen, I always choke up at the end.
237;It's kind of a long movie but the greatest ones are worth it, and i recommend people watching it the 1st time to make sure your focusing on the movie so you can really see everything that goes on.
238;But I'm 16 and I love it!
239;I have always liked this movie.
240;Well, that is a powerful scene.
241;here we also get a terrific performance from John Malkovich as the scavenger Basie.
242;This petty criminal is also pretty smart and takes a liking to young Jamie.
243;He probably sees something of himself in the boy and maybe that he likes doing something good.
244;He helps Jamie survive in the camp after a fashion.
245;Send him off at the first opportunity to live with the men, but, well, you will have to see the movie.
246;dr. Rawlins (well played by Nigel Havers) also protects the boy as well as the camp members.
247;And for a boy raised with such protection and privilege, well, surviving in such an environment is a real achievement.
248;i would love to talk about the movie with you.
249;It is a very rewarding film even if a great deal of it is done without dialogue.
250;At first, it's a bit of a child's dream.
251;he takes up, Oliver Twist like, with two American shady characters (a young John Malkovich and Joe Pantolino).
252;but he also takes to other parts.
253;He befriends a Japanese or two.
254;He also shows the isolation of the ex.
255;i strongly recommend this film to history buffs, particularly those who enjoy WW II films.
256;If you like John Malkovich, you'll love him here.Yes the movie moves a bit slow at times.
257;But overall, I found it to be a wonderful experience.
258;My brother, my husband, a co. worker of my husband and myself, think this movie is a superb piece of art.
259;At his tender age of thirteen years, he delivers such a wonderful performance that makes me think he was born to be the one who would make this film.
260;I hope my english is satisfactory.
261;It is also one of the few movies that have brought me to tears.
262;"Spielberg's brilliant at popcorn movies like ""Back to the future"" and ""The Duel"", the rest (seen ""AI""?!)"
263;The cinematography alone makes it worth a look, but it is a look at one aspect of WW2 that I wasn't aware of.
264;It is a moving depiction of the strength of the human spirit and will to overcome great problems.
265;It has great actors , humor, just about everything you could want in a good movie!
266;Spielberg crafted a great movie about world war II.
267;John Malkovich gives a performance of his career!!
268;A great movie to watch over and over!
269;It is one of the best I have seen.
270;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
271;It was a breathtaking masterpiece.
272;A superb piece of filmmaking.
273;Christian Bale was a wonder.
274;John Malkovich, who stars as the one nutcase weirdo he befriends, is perfect as always.
275;the cinematography, the locations, the amazing sets, all add up to a masterful 2.5 hours.
276;"Yes, there are some moments that probably could have been cut
I:8942;277;It takes the willingness to sit and watch a long film, and it takes the desire to step back in time and watch a real """"movie"""" as opposed to the studio."""
278;This movie made Christian Bale a legend.
279;Malkovich is Superb in a way that few actors can be.
280;Spielberg at his best with the best of co. workers and actors.
281;Timeless and touching, this film must be watched in silence and no disturbances.
282;A very respectful piece and portrayed to perfection.
283;"As far as I'm concerned this film is one of Spielberg's best
I:8942;284;The story is of a young English boy separated from his very well to do family during their escape from the soon to be Japanese occupied Shanghai China.
I:8942;285;The young lad portrayed by a much younger Christian Bale is captured by the Japanese and thrown into their camp.
I:8942;286;You'll see a youngster of wealth and privilege learn the true meaning of life through his interaction with fellow captives and the Japanese Army, which has enslaved them.
I:8942;287;There is a gradual transformation of a rich brat into man, which I believe will produce a laugh or two and possibly a few tears for most of you who watch this exceptional film.
I:8942;288;John Malkovich and the other supporting actors do a very fine job, though I feel Christian Bale is undeniably the shining star in this movie.
I:8942;289;This flick is worth watching.
I:8942;290;this movie is great, Spielburg directing, Christian Bale phenominal performance, Malkovich perfect in this role, all great acting as far as I'm concerned, excellent subject matter, a part of war easy to overlook, no big heroes just day to day survival of the craftiestpeople in an unbelievable environment.
I:8942;291;When i sat down to watch this i figured it was a dumb film, by the time i was finished i was crying, it literally won my heart.
I:8942;292;john malkovich is brilliant and christian bale is unforgetable.
I:8942;293;it's plot is full of character development and twists.
I:8942;294;This is definitely one of Spielbergs top films.
I:8942;295;Sweeping, emotional, beautifully shot and scored and acted .
I:8942;296;it really is a great film.
I:8942;297;it was overlooked when it came out, because it came out the same year that The Last Emperor was released, which got all the attention, both from the critics and from the movie.
I:8942;298;for me, the emotional heart of the movie is when Jim realizes that he can't remember what his mother looks like .
I:8942;299;See a very young Christian Bale (about 12?)
I:8942;300;This movie is truly a classic that will never die.
I:8942;301;this is a fine film that shows a lot of what life was like in China durning World War Two in a Japanese Prison camp.
I:8942;302;Why this lullaby still haunts me just goes to show you how expertly Spielberg and production team wove together the horrors of war with the universal longings of humanity for love, family, forgiveness, harmony, and peace once again.
I:8942;303;This irresistably sweet melody replays at various times throughout this movie depicting young Brit Jamie Graham, given the name """"Jim"""" by his more seasoned fellow survivalist Basie (played intriguingly by John Malkovich) for his """"new life"""", as they desparately try to stay alive, along with the other captives of war, mainly British in this movie, who were finally captured after attempts at escaping out of country."""
304;but the movie takes you inside the many struggles over which Jamie (now Jim) amazingly prevails, as a gifted boy coming of age during the tumultuous time following Japanese attacks on Shanghai in December of 1941.
305;one of my favorite scenes (of so many) was when Jim stands behind barbed wire and gets a peek at the renowned ritual of the Japanese sending their young pilots off to their death, in what we now recognize was so formidable to the Allied strategists .
306;Lengthy movie but very good, probably requires an audience that has an appreciation of WWII history and the events surrounding Japan's invasion of China.
307;The story spans from the boy's comfortable lifestyle living as a foreignor in China to the end of the war.
308;A remarkable sequence features an attack by U. s. Air Force fighter planes on the Japanese airfield adjacent to the boy's prison camp: it is startling as the boy sees visions of hope during this battle.
309;The movie is emotional and the ending is touching.
310;A classic movie on the irresistible power of the human spirit !
311;Goodness is a power that brings with it its own tremendous blessings!
312;"I don't know why EOTS didn't win Best Picture of 1987
I:8942;313;The quiet scene where he watches Mr. and Mrs. Victor attempt intimacy shows us the young man he's becoming in the midst of camp life.
I:8942;314;This whole film, cinematography, music score, and performances, is a fabulous winner.
I:8942;315;This is one of the best movies to come from my generation.
I:8942;316;This story grabs you from the very beginning and pulls you powerfully through a story based in WWII Colonial China.
I:8942;317;This is a movie everyone should watch at some point.
I:8942;318;Spielberg adds just the right amount of artistic design to carry the real life horror throughto the clear message in the boys eyes at the end.
I:8942;319;Very clear direction and understatedcreativity that doesn't overpower the very real circumstances but helps.
I:8942;320;This film is terrific, with wonderful music, acting, camera work, and images.
I:8942;321;I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves a good drama.
I:8942;322;it is also gives a glimpse into what it would be like to be in a work camp during a time of war.
I:8942;323;smarts and developed enough intestinal fortitude to regard his imprisonment as an exciting adventure.
I:8942;324;The story ends in the final days of WW2, with very emotional scenes that make thi movie really unforgettable.
I:8942;325;We have always enjoyed this movie, very well done, even though it is now about 25 years old, if you have never seen it, don't pass it over.
I:8942;326;Good story line and accurate events for the WWII timeframe it takes place.
I:8942;327;Chris Bale truly did extraordinary acting!
I:8942;328;If your a Speilburg fan this very well could be one you must have.
I:8942;329;christian Bail give a great performance from beginning to end always keeping you wondering what is around the corner
I:8942;330;beyond impressive performance by a young boy who has dialogue in almost every scene, how he was able to take intense direction from Spielberg incessantly is the sign of a genius, did christian learn anything from him other than EMOTE!??
I:8942;331;his cool reserve and complete immersion in future roles certainly demonstrate his mastery of acting.
I:8942;332;recommend for Christian Bale fans, Malkovich was so.
I:8942;333;so, China allied force history, British imperialism, and a how.
I:8942;334;One of the directors best efforts on film.
I:8942;335;It was better the second time.
I:8942;336;Good story line and very good performances by Christian Bale and John Malkovich.
I:8942;337;The fall to humility is a great teacher as young Christian Bale discovers.
I:8942;338;it is very entertaining and will hold your interest throughout.
I:8942;339;Excellent film depicting the struggle of a young boy trying to survive in the world of war.
I:8942;340;I just finished watching this film and really enjoyed the setting in Shanghai when the war started there.
I:8942;341;How this boy survived is well told and excellent graphics.
I:8942;342;Put it in your watch list, you will enjoy it.
I:8942;343;Many others have said the same that this is a great movie.
I:8942;344;but I will add one more thing, unlike many other movies of today, it really sticks in your mind.
I:8942;345;and the ending is a real tear jerker.
I:8942;346;Stephen Spielberg is a superior filmmaker so basically his films are a no.
I:8942;347;see regardless of the subject matter.
I:8942;348;It's a good thing to know about but the person who did it should be looked into.
I:8942;349;Nigel Havers adds much to some of the films finest moments as Dr Rawlins.
I:8942;350;Jim learns how to get by in prison, yet retains some elements of youthful innocence.
I:8942;351;He sees the brutality of the Japanese, yet remains friendly with them.
I:8942;352;He stays close to the American prisoners, but recoils at their disdain for Japanese life.
I:8942;353;visually this film is stunning.
I:8942;354;The musical score by John Williams matches the feeling of each scene precisely.
I:8942;355;Its' ending is most fitting.
I:8942;356;this film is simply magnificent.
I:8942;357;Under the direction of Steven Spielberg, Empire of the Sun promises to be stunning spectacle of life in China in the cocoon of the British ruling class in Shanghai.
I:8942;358;Jim, or Jamie, is played by Christian Bale who lives in this world of privilege and wealth attending public school and singing in the choir so popular in the Church of England.
I:8942;359;He ingratiates himself with the Japanese, befriends a Japanese youth across the wire, is sheltered by the British and encouraged by Americans to take risks that involve personal danger, he gains the admiration of the latter, and is taken under the wing of Basie, a man he idolizes, played by John Malkovich who makes room for him in the American quarters.
I:8942;360;You're an American now, kid.
I:8942;361;The Japanese become harsher in their treatment of these civilian interns as American forces draw closer, and the camp commander gives a beating to the British doctor (Nigel Havers) who has become a father figure to Jim.
I:8942;362;It introduces Christian Bales who turns in an outstanding performance.
I:8942;363;Sun Gn, a Welsh lullaby, is the theme song and is sung beautifully by James Rainbird.
I:8942;364;Nigel Havers, Miranda Richardson, and Joe Pantoliano are excellent in supporting roles.
I:8942;365;Finally, Steven Spielberg's direction is classic.
I:8942;366;What detracts from the song is that Steven Spielberg's direction is classic.
I:8942;367;It was also one film that was better than the book.
I:8942;368;See it for the music.
I:8942;369;I'm a huge Spielberg fan, so this review is biased!
I:8942;370;But EOTS is a gorgeous and classic Spielberg with its dramatic programmatic score by John Williams (Bravo!)
I:8942;371;and cinematography, Spielberg also has a knack for eliciting the best from kids.
I:8942;372;Christian Bale debuts as Jamie/Jim and is transformed from spoiled English boy to resourceful inmate to vapid/lost boy.
I:8942;373;John Malkovich is brilliant as Bale's America friend, over whom we vacillate between disgust and sympathy.
I:8942;374;Bale's exchange with the Japanese boy is a touching side that reveals the innocence of Bale's core, and his perhaps innate acceptance of others regardless of race.
I:8942;375;strings and draw a tear or 2.
I:8942;376;One of my favorite I return to regularly!
I:8942;377;though there are many who believe it is his best, like myself.
I:8942;378;What I love about this movie is not only the amazing visual effects and the outstanding acting, but also the wonderful style in which it was filmed and the style in which the story was told.
I:8942;379;I give this movie 5 stars.
I:8942;380;Great acting and the story is remarkable.
I:8942;381;Young Mr. Bale is quite exceptional in this movie.
I:8942;382;Malkavich dose his usual great job.
I:8942;383;In 1941, the world changes for a British boy after the Japanese invade Shanghai, China at the height of World War II.
I:8942;384;Without question, stunning is an understatement.
I:8942;385;See because as an actor I think you must understand the complexity of the world around you.
I:8942;386;You are not only portraying another's life, but also are part of a world, albeit make believe, however astute to a new and wonderful enviornment.
I:8942;387;Empire of the Sun will be and forever live in our love of film.
I:8942;388;form fitted with notions of pre.
I:8942;389;gentle reader, the great complexity of the years that have gone by, is the wonderment of how film lovers through the years, those that simply dance between the raindrops, hail this as one of the finest films in the history of cinema, and surely isnt it?
I:8942;390;Um, huh?Christian Bale perhaps, arguably gives the finest performance by anyone under the age of 18, save Jean.
I:8942;391;The very last scene in Empire resounds in many minds eye of one of the most moving and touching ever recorded on stock.
I:8942;392;The music fits every scene like a love glove in the county jail, So then?
I:8942;393;quid pro quoEasily Spielberg is a visionary giant, duh, a seemingly endless cache of lucid fairy tales, dreams, genuise and intrigue, that is UNPARRELLED in film.
I:8942;394;He touches our senses and digs deep into the portals of our imaginations, like very, very few do.
I:8942;395;He has shaped our lives, literally with his fascination to pure, endearing journeys.
I:8942;396;For the few, the proud who hail Empire of the Sun as one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8942;397;Well there is a reason, and you understand its magic.
I:8942;398;John Williams' score is magnificant, and Steven Spielberg delivers his usual top.
I:8942;399;I'm amazed at how many people love this movie.
I:8942;400;Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances.
I:8942;401;I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.
I:8942;402;A fascinating subject I will read J. g. Ballard's award.
I:8942;403;winning novel, the sequel, and his autobiography too but I recommend skipping the movie.
I:8942;404;The film contains a very compelling story about a young British boy who soon finds himself alone when the Japanese take over Shanghai during World War II.
I:8942;405;The boy (played fantastically by a young Christian Bale) goes through some incredible changes in his life, and this is where the story becomes very intriguing.
I:8942;406;i'm not really a fan of Spielberg, but this film is just one of his few films that I truly admire.
I:8942;407;It has a solid performance by Bale, a stellar supporting cast, some beautiful music, realistic sets, and breathtaking cinematography.
I:8942;408;It's a very good film, and it deserves its recognition among the general public.
I:8942;409;This is a gripping story of one young boy's experience during this very tumultuous time in Chinese history.
I:8942;410;Christian Bale was excellent in this.
I:8942;411;Christian Bale's introductory performance is genius, bolstered by great characters played by Joey Pants and Malkovitch.
I:8942;412;i first saw this in the theater when I was 14, and it hit me pretty hard.
I:8942;413;Great movie, story line and history, compassionate, heartbreaking, but stillEncouragement.
I:8942;414;The film itself is based on the bestselling novel by J. g. Ballard, whose own recollections as a young child in China are brilliantly brought to life in the form of the talented young actor Christian Bale.
I:8942;415;the film gives the viewer a very gritty look at how the civilian population had to survive now that hostilities existed between Japan and England.
I:8942;416;i found the cinematography to be outstanding.
I:8942;417;There setting for this film are very realistic, and one gets the feeling that they have indeed been transported through time to 1941.
I:8942;418;The cinematographers did an excellent job on this film.
I:8942;419;moreover, I found this films narrative to be both a masterpiece of storytelling, and a masterpiece of visuals as well, and Steven Spielberg was able to utilize these visuals to the hilt in this film by recreating WWII China, and it's subsequent occupation of the Japanese forces in the film.
I:8942;420;As for the story of a young British child named Jamie (Christian Bale) caught up in all the misery from which he was never exposed, his portrayal was superb.
I:8942;421;Also, I not only believe the entire film was great, but the supporting cast of Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank (Joe Pantoliano) enhanced the film's story and made this a masterful film.
I:8942;422;This is a great film.
I:8942;423;It is possibly Steven Spielberg's finest film .
I:8942;424;managing to capture a sense of the terror, brutality and despair endured by both the Chinese civilian population and the European internees in China during WWII and the magical.
I:8942;425;horrific journey of survival of a young British boy amidst it all.
I:8942;426;the provides a snapshot of pre.
I:8942;427;indulged son of a China.
I:8942;428;savvy, if still precocious, orphan of the war.
I:8942;429;Christian Bale's rendering of Jim is simply a revelation, beautifully capturing both the terror of loss and abandonment alongside the wide.
I:8942;430;ray release is simply stunning and does a magnificent justice to some of the most incredible cinematic images that Spielberg has captured on film.
I:8942;431;like images of Jim's sheltered world amidst the chaos of Shanghai are wonderful to behold but are easily eclipsed by the aerial scenes involving the internment camp and the nearby Japanese airfield later in the film.
I:8942;432;I came back a few hours later to watch a bit more and it did improve and actually become interesting for a bit.
I:8942;433;It definitely has it's high points and John Malkovich is always great to watch.
I:8942;434;Was decent enough to watch using the stairstepper.
I:8942;435;Talk about a favorite video, this is the one.
I:8942;436;It's always been a favorite to me.
I:8942;437;this sleeper classic of 1987 reflects the genius storytelling of Spielberg before his Director skills were recognized by Hollywood and his Oscars!!
I:8942;438;in Summary: A 12 year old rich, spoiled, totally dependent, English boy Jim Graham (played brillantly by Christian Bale) who idolizes Japanese aviators, the Japanese Zero aircraft and the supreme air power of the Japanese Military.
I:8942;439;He now idolizes the new world power America, the American aviator the P.51 Mustang aircraft Cadillac of the Sky .
I:8942;440;This movie totally consumes us and the John Williams sound track adds to the story telling.
I:8942;441;is Steven Spielbergs documentary A China Odyssey .
I:8942;442;A great background featurette showing us the detail and history of Shanghai then now!!
I:8942;443;This is a great film and now can understand the EMPIRE IN THE SUN .
I:8942;444;Excellent story of a young boy caught up in WWII.
I:8942;445;The acting is great too.
I:8942;446;i think Christian Bale was one of the greatest child stars of our time, and John Williams provided Music to still the soul and heighten the movie to it's zenith.
I:8942;447;Christian Bale as a youngster is good.
I:8942;448;A bit sappy at times, but great overall.
I:8942;449;I would recommend this movie.
I:8942;450;All of the positive reviews above are right on the mark.
I:8942;451;cGI sets, the number of extras, and the use of real military craft.
I:8942;452;Christian Bale does a fine job of acting in this film (it's uncanny seeing features in young Christian that I recognize in the adult Christian Bale), but still, he's a 12 year old kid who is prone to doing 12 year old kid stuff.
I:8942;453;spielberg brings some clever camera angles to the table, and given the source material it is well.
I:8942;454;made, well scripted, and well.
I:8942;455;amazing acting by Christian Bale.
I:8942;456;One of the few movies that I liked John Malkovich in'Dramatic show of clash of cultures.
I:8942;457;Excellent movie with Christian Bale, child actor, in the starring role.
I:8942;458;It is truly a masterpiece of acting by Christan Bale.
I:8942;459;He is truly a gifted actor, the absolute best of his generation.
I:8942;460;He is generally very particular about what projects he's involved in.
I:8942;461;And the movie, just a masterpiece of filmmaking.
I:8942;462;He saw his mother and so gently removed her hat to touch her hair, then her mouth.
I:8942;463;The relief that was expressed in his eyes was so simple a gesture but so powerful.
I:8942;464;Empire of the Sun, is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8942;465;It is definitely one of the best films Steven Spielberg ever directed.
I:8942;466;The story itself was touching and almost brought a tear to my eye.
I:8942;467;This movie's story was touching and gave you some insight to the human soul.
I:8942;468;I have seen it several times and it is now one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8942;469;If you haven't seen it, it's a must.
I:8942;470;A great film for the whole family, especially children.
I:8942;471;There is so much meaning and content to this film, you can't help but think about it for hours after watching it.
I:8942;472;This movie, in my humble opinion, is the greatest masterpiece Steven Spielberg has ever created.
I:8942;473;sentimentality (despite some good moments of truth)and children.
I:8942;474;Because its based on J. Ballard's semi.
I:8942;475;It has gorgeous cinematography, realistic art direction, and brilliant acting by a largely British cast,and the always exceptional American, John Malkovich.
I:8942;476;Christian Bale is very very good at a young age, and that wasn't a surprise.
I:8942;477;That he has managed to preserve his independence and abilities is also a testament to a good actor.)
I:8942;478;And finally, John Williams' score is more restrained than usual, and the use of the Welsh lullaby """"Suo Gan"""" at the beginning of the film was a nice touch too."""
479;So, if you are interested in seeing a thoughtful, beautifully filmed and acted historical drama, where the tears fall for real reasons not sentimental ones, please see this film.
480;"And know that Spielberg was a master director long before ""Schindler's List."""
481;Beautifully shot, nicely scored, well acted, and .
482;above all else, well written and put together.
483;Script and dialogue are definetly above average, and are executed as they should be.
484;in sum, it is a very stylish production throughout.
485;A moving and interesting story.
486;It isn't the only film of its kind, but it does stand out as one of the best.
487;In my personal opinion this is a better achievement for Spielberg than Schindler's List.
488;An excellent film that has been underrated in my opinion.
489;Watching the young British boy mature amid the ravishes of World War II is a poignant experience.
490;Stephen Spielberg expertly creates the era and the place and takes us into the heart of the boy Jim.
491;He was twelve or thirteen at the time and already had a strong enough screen presence to match John Malkovich scene for scene, and that's quite a feat.
492;"worthy movie (after ""The Color Purple""), something with historical or social impact."
493;"well, along came Christopher Nolan and ""Batman Begins"", a fabulous movie at so many levels (""."
494;"winning ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", both great movies IMHO ."
495;christian Bale, as an adult, playing Batman with grace and subtlety, free of Spielberg, is so much better as an actor.
496;I'll give Spielberg credit for even visiting these black marks in history .
497;This is a beautifully shot movie with striking imagery and strong production values, all classic Spielberg hallmarks, and yet it is deeply hollow inside.
498;One sees the welcoming enthusiasm of the Chinese people in opening up the city of Shanghai for the first time for filming by the Great American Director Steven Spielberg.
499;One gets to see images of Shanghai, circa 1986.87, right at the cusp of its re.
500;This is a great story for all ages.
501;Not only is this timeless, it reminds us of what our destiny should be.
502;Beautiful film overall with lots of history woven throughout the personal story of an adolescent just trying to survive.
503;My favorite Spielberg and Bale film.
504;generally, I liked the story it told.
505;it got on my nerves.
506;the ending was emotional and happy.
507;Christian Bale, even at 13, played Jamievery well, like some tough, smart kids I've known.
508;when Kids are involved, I like a happy ending.
509;It is a treasure and seeing 26 years after its initial release only enhances the impact this film made on the world not yet ready for such an epic.
510;tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel `The Empire of the Sun' which tells the story of a boy, James Graham (Christian Bale, very young and very talented), whose privileged life is upturned by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, December 8, 1941.
511;Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him.
512;It is a deeply moving film, beautifully captured in cinematography and musical scoring .
513;a film that belongs in the library of all film buffs.
514;Great movie with a young but talented Christian Bale.
515;This film is a masterpiece, perhaps Spielberg's most underrated film.
516;This is Spielberg's great WWII film, not Private Ryan.
517;Christian Bale gives a truly amazing performance as the boy here who is left behind in Shanghai when the Japanese take over.
518;John Malkovich is great too as the cunning, cynical American who, in many ways, runs part of the prison camp.
519;This is harrowing, yet poetic at the same time.
520;It has great source material (it's based on JG Ballard's autobiographical novel), and the screenplay is by Tom Stoppard, one of the great British playwrights/screenwriters.
521;I have always liked this film, and continue to do so.
522;This is one of Steven's best films.
523;This version is the one I have waited for.
524;I am amazed at the fantastic cinematography and the outstanding acting performance by a young Christian Bale.
525;He should have received an Oscar for his role.
526;Christian Bale stars as the young hero of this Spielberg masterpiece.
527;More than anything James/Jim (Bale) loved aircraft.
528;a touching tale of friendship and perseverance during a miserable time in the world's history.
529;The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate.
530;The sound is also quite good.
531;The widescreen format has been enhanced for large screen TVs, so the film fills most of the screen area.
532;'Empire of the Sun' looked quite good on my 46.
533;Highly recommended film to watch again and again with the family.
534;jim, the main character, and his prestigious family live in Japan during the Japanese.
535;He loves planes, bombers, B1's, planes of any kind.
536;Jim characteristically has enough charm to wriggle free of most enounters, such as this one to survive.
537;oddly, in the camp Jim is the true survivor.
538;He learns the ropes of the camp quickly and does well pleasing himself and others.
539;One quote from the movie that hit me emotionally is when Jim is asked what he learned best.
540;"The ""camp"" becomes Jim's whole life, and he makes the best of it."
541;"There are enough outstanding , ""little miracles"" to keep the rhythm of this movie flowing to the end."
542;Both are fabulous, real, and substantial.
543;Let's just say that it is one of the best movies ever made and with the hundreds that fit that description, it's impossible to give this one a number.
544;Jim stays in his home for a while until the food supplies run out.
545;One of the most memorable scenes of the movie occurs on that runway.
546;Jim is caught with is hands on a Japanese aircraft is about to be shot by a guard and aircrew come along and stop the guard.
547;Jim salutes them and they salute back.
548;Where to his delight cylinders full of good fall.
549;Though I think Saving Private Ryan and Shindlers List are better.
550;Would win Best Picture in 2014 tooIt Is absolutely wonderfulAnd Christian Bale deserves best actor too .
551;I can recommend this edition without hesitation.
552;The Blu ray book also looks gereat and has some interesting facts and movie stills in it.
553;old students, and they loved it.
554;I looked forward because I heard this was a great movie.
555;It is NOT a great movie.
556;the ususal Spielberg special effects are good, but, damn, a good story that made sense would have been a lot better.
557;This has a clearer picture, enhanced audio,and is much cleaner than the VHS tape I previously owned.
558;I got caught up in this movie, even so very dramatic!
559;Great story and i really enjoyed the acting in this movie.
560;This is a movie for the whole family.
561;A compelling story, beautiful cinematograhy, and all star cast make this film one of Spielberg's best films
562;The first and best of Spielberg's historical films (and, possibly, of all his films).
563;The motion picture exhibits a great screenplay (by Tom Stoppard), great direction, and superb acting (notably by a young Christian Bale).
564;Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Lincoln, and others.
565;are also extraordinary for depth and insight, but not as extraordinary as Empire of the Sun.
566;This is a very realistic portrayal of the happenings prior to the US involvement in WWII in Japanese occupied China.
567;I can identify with the boy in the story.
568;very well played by a young Christian Bale.
569;this one is well worth the price.
570;Great acting, action, and cinematography.
571;This is a film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg.
572;This review should actually be for the 'Keepcase' edition as my copy includes the second disc of special features that are worth seeing.
573;This is actually extremely good, you know, Speilberg.
574;Great movie!I was suprised to see what a good actor Christian Bale played at such a young age.
575;a little on the long side but still very watchable.
576;One of my top 10 Favorite films.
577;apocalyptic feel is very nice as well.
578;A gripping tale of perseverance and survival in the midst of turmoil and chaos.
579;An amazing performance from Christopher Bale when he was a child.
580;Beautifully filmed and a story told extremely well.
581;creation of Old Shanghai is really something to see (and something we will probably never see again, given the city's massive development in the last fifteen years).
582;It is really Spielberg's tribute to one of his admitted heroes, the great epic chronicler of imperialism David Lean, but EMPIRE OF THE SUN shows almost none of Lean's interests in the corroding effects of empire among the colonized.
583;Jamie's love of planes and toy planes is clearly a point of sympathetic entry for the director (who loves boys and their toys), but it is given little emotional meaning for anyone viewing the film since Jamie's love of planes always creates danger for himself and everyone else.
584;The film is structurally very daring for Spielberg because there's so little dialogue in the script, and he does manage to convey quite a lot without it.
585;the beautiful and gravefaced Christian Bale gives a sterling performance in this film that has been widely and justly praised, although Spielberg does require him to yell his head off a bit too much (this was also Spielberg's problem more recently with Dakota Fanning in WAR OF THE WORLDS).
586;One of the best historical war films.
587;I saw this in the theater when it first came out and thought it was pretty good.
588;After watching it again at home I have to change that opinion.
589;It is excellent, a great story beautifully filmed with a top notch cast throughout.
590;A beautiful film with great acting and accompanying soundtrack.
591;You can see from this film why Christian Bale is now so highly regarded as one of our best actors today.
592;Who knew he was such an extremely talented actor, but when you see this movie you will be moved as I was.
593;I had to have this movie in my collection so that I can watch it anytime I feel like it and be taken into another time and place for a few hours.
594;i really love this movie.
595;A wonderful story that grips and holds your attention.
596;A dynamic story well worth the read.
597;They can sway elections and bring down good people.
598;They need to keep America down to stay in business and to please their real owners.
599;This movie lets us see the way we would be living, if Obama had his way and forged a new malitia, which is a personal army of his own to do away with you and train your children to do his dirty work to keep him and his people in power.
600;Ever wonder what America at its very best looks like to the rest of the world?
601;This film will show you.
602;Airplanes and their role in WWII serve as a metaphor for a higher power in Empire of the Sun, and airplanes also serve as a vehicle for several personal epiphanies on Jamie's part that I won't give away.
603;this film, like so many great films, cannot be properly enjoyed in a room full of talking people, with dropped popcorn, ringing cellphones and other distractions.
604;I give it my highest recommendation, and in my mind it deserves a place in the top 100 best films ever made.
605;This movie is discriptively beautiful and always surprising.
606;An epic tale of surprising depth.
607;He see's traits that he admires, that of bravery and stoicism.
608;He watches great battles in the air, in which even the camp is set in the battle, where mustangs are seemingly playing in the sky, as he did with his toy planes.
609;Making playful circles and tipping their wings boyishly.
610;He lives years in the camp while others pass, and makes a new family.
611;All of this works from the real passion of the actors and juxtaposing soundtrack.
612;everything works in this film.
613;Spielberg was granted with a wonderful gift, and he seemed inspired to make this film.
614;One of the most unfamiliar Spielberg films, and definatly his most underrated film.
615;It just captured my attention and made me more aware of things outside of my little world.
616;Great movie and a great story very touching, real life Chris Bale great acting, Real story that happen during WWll
617;This movie was a good movie to show any young person an example of what it was like to live overseas during the war.
618;This movie is a good example of survival and leadership.
619;This movie was a good example of leadership in that the young boy named Jim learns to do for himself and survive without his mom and dad being around.
620;He learns to craft ways to help others survive and keep a positive look on the crumbling world around them.
621;This movie inspires and teaches one self to always consider others and keep a postive look on life, no matter what is going on around the world.
622;I recommend this movie to families, but especially to the kids in the family, so that they appreciate what they have and why they have what they have today.
623;It's a reminder of ethics and consideration of human life, freedom, and survival.
624;I therefore viewed the situations with a child's attitude, similar to Jim's.
625;I did not know what an atom bomb was, so I still thought he DID see Mrs. Victor's soul going up to heaven.
626;"(get the soundtrack
I:8942;627;Now in my 20s, I watched the film for the first time again recently and found myself deeply moved.
I:8942;628;I am able to watch and appreciate the film from both an adult as well as a child's perspective, which gives it much more meaning than I thought possible.
I:8942;629;This movie is outstanding and Christian Bale is simply too outstanding to attempt to explain.
I:8942;630;Empire of the Sun is more than a favorite movie"
631;This is an excellent epic movie.
632;I identified with the main character, a British boy who spends his adolescence as a prisoner in a Japanese concentration camp.
633;It truely is a portrait of the human spirit.
634;i've watched this movie 5 times and enjoyed each time.
635;I remember being moved to tears fifteen years ago when I saw this film when it was first released in theatres.
636;this is perhaps his best film.
637;it's an epic on the grand scale .
638;but the story itself is quite intimate.
639;It is, in essence, a coming of age story about a young privileged English boy who is forced to learn some of life's harshest lessons while in some of the direst of circumstances.
640;In this case, most vividly represented by John Malkovich's Baisie , an American thief, not unlike Jude Law's Gigolo Joe in A. i. Unlike Spielberg's most recent effort, the boy in this film, Jim, finds a more 'realistic' solace in the end as opposed to the 'virtual' reunion of A. i. the performances are outstanding, most notably a very young Christian Bale as the boy, Jim.
641;The cinematography is stunning, particularly Spielberg's rendering of Shanghai in the weeks before the Japanese invasion.
642;Now married, my wife has become interested in The Pacific War and also found this a compelling, rather factual drama of that period.
643;Highly recommend this Spielberg Classic featuring Cristian Bale in his first film.
644;This movie was nominated and won so many awards because it deserved it, although I wish Christian Bale had received more attention at the time!
645;A star in the making!
646;This was his first movie and he was spectacular!
647;John Malkovich, also, delivers as usual.
648;This is a great family film, that takes you on a wonderful, and sometimes emotional and thought.
649;recommend to anyone who likes World War II movies, too, as it takes place at that time.
650;From the cinematography to music to performances, everything was done well!
651;I found this to be a touching and poignant film, with qualities nearing those of an opera.
652;An example is when the boy is watching the plane fly, and meets the Japanese boy, communicating only through their common love of flight.
653;It is beautiful and disturbing at the same time, and especially gripping to see the horror of war through the eyes of innocence.
654;Historical achievement for WWII, with a soft touch.
655;As another reviewer so aptly put it, Empire of the Sun is a movie that stays with you.
656;Somehow, on some level, you will be deeply affected by this movie.
657;Christian Bale and John Malkovich are perfectly cast.
658;empire of the Sun is Spielberg movie art at its best.
659;I could write a novel about how good this movie is.
660;Christian Bale is amazing, stunning, I could go on and on.
661;This is a beautifully made and acted film.
662;It is somewhat dependent on the touching performance of a young, inexperienced Christian Bale, but many movies center on one character, and the supporting actors are great also.
663;the musical score by John Williams stands out as exceptional.
664;Like all the best Spielberg, Empire of the Sun directly touches the heart while almost incidentally conveying powerful insights about war, survival and the human spirit.
665;It is an underestimated gem!
666;i found myself emotionally rapped up in the story and enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
667;"A film by Steven SpielbergFilm critic Ernest Rister has written a brilliant review of ""Empire of the Sun"" where he details the unreality of the movie, how the viewer cannot trust what we are seeing on screen because it is the impressions of a 12 year old child and Spielberg gives us enough hints and allusions and images in the film that with a little bit of work, the viewer should be able to figure this out."
668;They are happening as a twelve year old boy is seeing them, heightened and slightly distorted.
669;"Fortunately, ""Empire of the Sun"" works on two levels: as a straightforward film, and also on the level that Rister discovered and Spielberg intended."
670;Steven Speilberg has made so many films to be proud of, but this has to be my very favorite.
671;"The story, the music, the cinematography, the characters, and the recreations of pre WWII China are simply phenomenal
I:8942;672;great movies have a lasting effect on you.
I:8942;673;i live in Oregon, so it's pretty doubtful I will ever see Steven Spielberg hanging out at the local Starbucks.
I:8942;674;This has to be one of Speilberg's best movies, ever!
I:8942;675;I have used this movie in my world history classes"
676;John Malkovich does an excellent job as well.
677;Empire of the Sun is an epic tale to be enjoyed by the whole family (PG).
678;I ordered it for my family (including Vets) to enjoy for Memorial Day weekend.
679;Spielberg is KNOWN to have dramatic, feel good endings, and I really thought that this movie needed a nice payoff.
680;The casting in the movie is superb!
681;Young Christian Bale is OUTSTANDING in this movie and really steals the whole entire movie, even though he is the main character.
682;John Malkovich here is also good, but Christian shines above them all.
683;Also, we see a side in Spielberg that we would see in his blockbuster movie Schindler's List, and we see that he shows the cruelties and hardships of war.
684;So yes, like every movie, this has its faults, but it truly is a golden movie, and I wish more movies like this could be made to show people that it's okay to let a little tears flow during movies!
685;I love this movie about an English boy trapped in China during the Japanese invasion.
686;i challenge any human being, man or woman, to NOT choke up and shed a tear when viewing the happy ending of this movie!
687;A remarkable story of an intelligent but self centered boy who after loosing everything over the course of a war comes to find compassion.
688;Christian Bale as Jim gave the best child actor performance I ever seen.
689;Every teen age boy should see this film.
690;Dont expect a feel good ending here.
691;movies don't get any better than this, this is a great story with a fantastic cast.
692;this film should be an all time favorite with all, young and old.
693;I like this tale, I always have.
694;But it is an amalgam of several peoples experiences in that region during those war years.
695;This is a classic movie.
696;I already knew I loved the movie, that's why I bought it.
697;I would definitely recommend it to others to watch.
698;I was very pleased with the product and with the speed of delivery.
699;i recommend to fellow film buffs.
700;Christian Bale is awesome, very strong performance by the future Batman, LOL I would really recommend this movie who is fan of Steven Spielberg s flicks
701;I have read the book, but it is the film that gives you the feeling you are looking through a window in time.
702;The camera work and the acting are excellent.
703;A grand, sweeping film of epic proportions, this stands the test of time in more ways than most films do.
704;Christian Bale gives us a sneak peak at his extraordinary presence as an actor, something he did not really realize again until the release of American Psycho in 2000.
705;In truth, Empire of the Sun deserves renewed respect.
706;It is one of those movies that makes you wonder if it was based on a true story.
707;People of all ages can enjoy this film about coming of age in a time of war.
708;It has beautiful imagery and uses its soundtrack very effectively.
709;Beautiful work from a younger Spielberg.
710;The movie starts with a boy (Jim).
711;Whom is a very wealthy English boy living in China during the early 40's.
712;Upon the invasion of the Japanese into China Jim is separated from his family.
713;Jim is eventually moved to a camp of sorts, not really a concentration camp, but a prison camp nonetheless.
714;Jim adapts well to his new surroundings and makes friends with the American's in the camp.
715;Jim is eventually returns to his former life, but not until he witnessed the atom bomb drop.
716;Quite a good movie, although the movie is slow in spots.
717;Overall well done and a great soundtrack.
718;Starts out as a spoiled brat and ends as just a great kid.
719;Empire of the Sun is directed by Steven Spielberg and has the makings of a masterpiece.
720;It's got Spielberg directing it, it's a semi.
721;The film has a couple tense, action scenes though.
722;Malkovich is, as always, fun to watch (although he doesn't have a lot of screentime.
723;The movie's biggest flaws are its running time and its happy ending.
724;The happy ending seemed so out of context to, it seems almost as if a studio overpowered Spielberg.
725;Anybody who loves John Malkovich or Steven Spielberg should like the film though, it is worthy of checking out.
726;It's kind of interesting to see him.
727;This is good filmmaking, but awful story.
728;"I hope he got a director's share and a producer's share in the profits, because without him this would have been ""Reds"" or ""Ishtar"" or the directors cut of ""Brazil""."
729;It was an enjoyable movie.
730;It is pretty old but the story line still impacts.
731;For the price, I recommend.
732;"Liked for historical content and especially that the film was based on true childhood events of author J. g. Ballard, but mainly liked for incredible acting by young Christian Bale
I:8942;733;In my opinion, this is one of Spielberg's best ever films.
I:8942;734;Bale at only 13 or 14 is amazing in display of emotions, compelling, both subtle and dramatic, and totally believable as this courageous boy trying to survive under horrific conditions of WW II .
I:8942;735;These are my favorite type of movie to watch.
I:8942;736;did this movie really tell you something meaningful or important enough to be remembered?
I:8942;737;this young boy roamed in and out of the gray zone with his flexibility to kiss everybody who could give him some benefit, and his survival instinct was so amazing, better than most of the adults.
I:8942;738;I love this classic film and now I have the chance to watch it when ever I want.
I:8942;739;This was a fantastic film when I first saw it in the theater.
I:8942;740;I watched it the other night and it is still an amazing, moving film.
I:8942;741;are completely believable and the actor gives a brilliant performance.
I:8942;742;The one thing that doesn't change is his wonder with flight and planes.
I:8942;743;The child Jim and his fascination with flying and planes and his ability to adapt, while still retaining some child.
I:8942;744;like innocence and loyalty, keep the film from becoming gloomy.
I:8942;745;Christian Bale makes an excellent performance in Empire of the Sun.
I:8942;746;empire of the sun is well written and keeps its audience intrigued.
I:8942;747;This is a drama/action movie.
I:8942;748;christian Bale's performance is excellent.
I:8942;749;Christian Bale can fight, fly, do magic, and sing.
I:8942;750;This is one of my all time favorite movies and I was so excited when it came out on blu ray.
I:8942;751;It is a wonderful story about a coming of age and survival of a young boy during the war.
I:8942;752;recognized gem by Steven Spielberg.
I:8942;753;This is the first movie I have seen Christian as a young actor.
I:8942;754;This movie was so heart.
I:8942;755;wrenching, that I cried throughout the movie it is every bit worth more than 5stars.
I:8942;756;however, I would certainly rank it up there as one of Spielberg's better films.
I:8942;757;It also showed that he could shoot some fantastic scenes.
I:8942;758;The scene where the Kamikaze pilots go up is fantastic.
I:8942;759;This film is an outstanding example how Speilberg can make big budget Hollywood films into powerful art pieces.
I:8942;760;This is by far the best example of that.
I:8942;761;The acting is superb, the visuals are beautiful and yet neccessary.
I:8942;762;Also, unlike Saving Private Ryan, the scenes that raise emotion are subtle in direction and intelligently crafted by the director.
I:8942;763;It makes Saving Private Ryan look like an action film.
I:8942;764;steven Spielberg is an emotional, sentimental director who isn't afraid to pour his beliefs onto the screen.
I:8942;765;not only the most underrated Speilberg film, but perhaps the most underrated Hollywood masterpiece ever.
I:8942;766;Before you watch this film, it's probably a good idea to understand a few things up front.
I:8942;767;For one, the film is about a boy of British decent.
I:8942;768;The family is quite rich, and has many Chinese for servants.
I:8942;769;somehow I found it hard, at first, to know exactly what was going on.
I:8942;770;It does help to know this going into the film.
I:8942;771;I think I'd have enjoyed it alot more to understand that is was a partly true story.
I:8942;772;Anyone loving airplaines would love looking at the old ones.
I:8942;773;Scenery is nice, shot on a nice location.
I:8942;774;If you love history and/or ever experienced childhood insecurity, as so many of us have, you will love this movie.
I:8942;775;One of my all time favorite movies!
I:8942;776;Christian Bale was an amazing child actor and this movie is proof of that.
I:8942;777;one of my favorites of ALL time.
I:8942;778;Magical Best wartime movie , this movie deserved much more credit than it received.
I:8942;779;Christian Bale gives the best performance of his career in this movie in MHO.
I:8942;780;One of my all time favorite movies and will watch again
I:8942;781;Good story, unusual angle for a WWII film.
I:8942;782;Excellent Spielberg film that I (think) debuts Christian Bale's acting as a young boy.
I:8942;783;one of my favorite movies of all time!!
I:8942;784;good classic family movie .
I:8942;785;I love all of Spielberg's work and still consider Jaws and the original Indiana Jones his best works and have watched each over 25 times.
I:8942;786;To show grace under pressure is divine.
I:8942;787;This reinforces faith in the human condition.
I:8942;788;Jim's face reflects divine peace and happiness and is resplendant from the light from heaven.
I:8942;789;Christian Bale should have received the Oscar for best actor that year.
I:8942;790;I will now have to add this sweeping soundtrack to my library.
I:8942;791;This joyous music stays with you.
I:8942;792;This touching move also will.
I:8942;793;When my children get old enough to watch, they will also be blessed by this timeless story of good vover evil.
I:8942;794;To everyone else who hasn't seen this movie, I highly recommend it.
I:8942;795;scenes, real history lessons I learned in my regular high school and college classes.
I:8942;796;com is so easy to work with.
I:8942;797;A most excellent film of this era long forgotten in history books.
I:8942;798;It has many laughs and you will also find some tears coming down your face.
I:8942;799;Plenty of great cast members including a very young Christian Bale.
I:8942;800;Spielberg was spot on with this one!
I:8942;801;Most underrated movie of all time.
I:8942;802;steven Spielberg gave us another great movie.
I:8942;803;A classic movie and christian bale to boot.
I:8942;804;I love a good steven spielberg movie to help me remember why I like movies.
I:8942;805;I is a intense drama.
I:8942;806;Emotions are touched all the time.
I:8942;807;It is recommended for viewers of good movies.
I:8942;808;Christian Bale's performance is truly haunting.
I:8942;809;A truly underated and underappreciated film.
I:8942;810;I've been looking for this movie and its beautiful music for a long time and finally found it.
I:8942;811;An amazing film, with stunning locations (early 1940's China), and great performances by John Malkovich and a young Christian Bale.
I:8942;812;era, Japanese occupied China is the setting for J. g. Ballard's best.
I:8942;813;It is a triumph of human spirit!
I:8942;814;After witnessing a flash of intense light in the sky, and believing he has seen a human soul rise to heaven"
815;The movie is filled with such images, and is an intensely beautiful visual masterpiece.
816;Empire of the Sun is still crisp and relevant today!
817;"This is a ""must"" have movie in any collection."
818;This is one of the master works of Steven Spielberg.
819;Christian Bale makes his stunning movie debut in this Spielberg directed film as Jamie, a 12 year old British boy, who grows up in luxury and opulence as the son of a wealthy textile factory owner in China during WWII.
820;An extremely bright and resourceful boy (played brilliantly by Bale), he uses his natural leadership and aggression to stay alive and become indispensable to the American who becomes the unofficial leader (godfather) of the prison camp.
821;The camera work, acting and screenplay are exceptional, not to mention the music.
822;The film loses a little something (I think) when Spielberg gets a little too artistic and surreal but this is still one of Spielberg's best.
823;Overall, a very interesting and worthwhile movie about another slice of WWII and how the human spirit adapts when it is put into survival mode.
824;He shows great talent at a young age and the story is admirable but seemed slow and tedious.
825;The story is somewhat interesting, and Jim has a wild imagination that gives some interest.
826;"The ""Empire of the Sun"" is based on a real."
827;life autobiography and Steven Spielberg directs.
828;This was an incredibly emotional movie with excellent acting.
829;In my opinion, this is Spielberg's best film.
830;"empire of the Sun gets lost sometimes in the film snob's library
I:8942;831;Much like Blade Runner, the audience misconceives what the movie is really about, and many film.
I:8942;832;goers absolutely refuse to empathize with a bleeding.
I:8942;833;sure, the film tugs on the heart strings.
I:8942;834;If this movie were released today, it would win Best Picture in a heartbeat.
I:8942;835;I saw this film many, many years ago when I was young and it was the first film that truly moved me.
I:8942;836;I didn't just shed a tear, but I sobbed and sobbed!
I:8942;837;And most recently watching it as an adult, I still found the film just as powerful and moving.
I:8942;838;The most touching scene to be where Christian Bale sings the Japanese anthem across the fence looking at the Japanese soldiers.
I:8942;839;The acting, directing, cinematography and settings are all just fantastic.
I:8942;840;This is my kind of film, there are many painful scenes and happy ones, either way, both were extremely moving.
I:8942;841;i found great pleasure in Christian Bale's recent comeback to box.
I:8942;842;this film, without a doubt, is in my top 5 films of all time.
I:8942;843;I haven't seen it for awhile but it is a classic.
I:8942;844;A young Christian Bale stars as Jim, a young boy of British descent who is caught up in the Japanese invasion of China.
I:8942;845;I found the movie beautifully made and there are scenes which make me weep.
I:8942;846;I read the book after seeing the movie the first time and it remains one of my favorite novels ever.
I:8942;847;I also learned about civilian life during World War II in Asia.
I:8942;848;This is one of the best movies i ever seen.
I:8942;849;The actors are great and is very emotive.
I:8942;850;in fact this is by far the best Steven Spielberg movie.
I:8942;851;i do not recommend it for people who loves movies in Hollywood's styles.
I:8942;852;I enjoyed every aspect of this film.
I:8942;853;Story,talent and production were spot on.
I:8942;854;Great addition to any film library.
I:8942;855;This film should have been awarded an Academy Award for Best Film of the Year in my view.
I:8942;856;He is utterly engaging, chatty, infinitely curious, enterprising, resourceful, generous, eager to please, polite, and without bias.
I:8942;857;It takes him a while to connect his love of airplanes and pilots with their destructive power.
I:8942;858;old view of this slice of history is convincing and separates this film from other war movies.
I:8942;859;i recall thinking then what a good performance he gave for being a young.
I:8942;860;It was wonderful watching it again on Amazon streaming today knowing what a successful career Christian now has.
I:8942;861;Of course, everyone knows Christian as Batman.
I:8942;862;It is a feel good movie with outstanding performances by Christian and John Malcovich.
I:8942;863;I watched it when i was very young here in sweden and i loved it back then and still do.
I:8942;864;I saw this movie in 1987 and loved it.
I:8942;865;this came on a day when my cable went out, so I loved seeing it again.
I:8942;866;This documentary played a clip of some of Steven Spielberg's movies set during World War 2.
I:8942;867;when I heard the beautiful John Williams' score play on my TV and a boy watching a lone fighter plane soar across the runway, I was immediately captivated and sat in awe as this boy cheered on the fighter plane.
I:8942;868;the movie itself is a visual masterpiece with never a dull moment.
I:8942;869;This movie contains some of the most memorable and beuatiful scenes I have ever seen anywhere.
I:8942;870;The story itself is full of drama, action, and suspence that captures your heart and never lets go even after the end credits are rolling!As usual, John Williams delivers with one of his greatest scores ever.
I:8942;871;The visual effects are astounding and perfectly executed to enhance the storytelling of the movie.
I:8942;872;i disagree with some of the negative reviews that plague this underrated epic.
I:8942;873;EMPIRE OF THE SUN is my favorite Spielberg film.
I:8942;874;but EMPIRE is really high on my list.
I:8942;875;What an outstanding (and underrated) film!
I:8942;876;The film, in all of its forms, has stayed with me all these years.
I:8942;877;first, Spielberg has a top.
I:8942;878;EMPIRE OF THE SUN is deeply moving.
I:8942;879;Thematically, Spielberg tells us the story of growing up, losing one's innocence, and learning that people will do anything for a Hershey bar.
I:8942;880;When Jim throws his suitcase containing all of his boyhood possessions into the river, he makes an important choice in life.
I:8942;881;And yet Spielberg, who is a sentimentalist, reminds us that after surviving life's hardships we all still need a hug from our mothers.
I:8942;882;eMPIRE OF THE SUN is one of Spielberg's best .
I:8942;883;if not THE best film he's made.
I:8942;884;He has become a very big cult favorite, as he will become A. listed after he stars in Batman Begins, this Summer, and in November along with Colin Farrell, The New World.
I:8942;885;the rest of the cast is great as one would think when you are seeing a Stephan Speilberg film you can't get any better.
I:8942;886;This movie deserves alot more respect than it gets, i believe when it came out it should of one the Oscar for Best Picture, and Best Supporting Actor Chirstian Bale.
I:8942;887;This is a great movie check it out.
I:8942;888;This is an incredibly moving, meaningful, literary film.
I:8942;889;It rewards every viewing with fresh insights.
I:8942;890;christian Bale, as Jim, won the National Board of Review, USA, Best Juvenile Performance, and the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture .
I:8942;891;He is in the moment, every moment, as he gets separated from his family, at the tender age of 12, taken from his protected life in the foreign compound, and faces a new life as a POW.
I:8942;892;Jim: I was dreaming about God.
I:8942;893;When I say turn right, turn right!
I:8942;894;[After Soochow, everyone is moved to the Airfield.
I:8942;895;Jim, a virtual orphan now, bunks with battle.
I:8942;896;Would you like a Hershey's bar?Jim: Yes please, Basie.
I:8942;897;Jim: I was dreaming about God.
I:8942;898;jim: Perhaps He's our dream.
I:8942;899;the shot of the distant detonation was so beautiful, like the Aurora Borealis, that it could have been THE prize.
I:8942;900;I was stunned first of all by the cinematography: gorgeous sunsets"
901;i couldn't lose: this is a movie which appeals to the mind and senses and I could pay little money for it.
902;i was also interested in viewing again the geography of Shanghai, since the movie was shot on location in China.
903;Is it as beautiful as the cinematographer films it?
904;Probably I'll never know and this is the closest I can get to the reality of Shanghai.
905;His adolescent years are portrayed in a brilliant performance by English actor, Christian Bale.
906;the acclaimed actor, John Malkovich, plays Jim Graham's mentor.
907;Malkovich's character is an American opportunist who is on the shady side of what is honest and upright behaviour.
908;What can I say of Malkovich's performance except it was true to form: he is Malkovich which means he gave a flawless performance.
909;An important element in the film is the boy's attraction to airplanes.
910;Their eyes and smiles meet and they recognize a fellow plane lover.
911;On the other side of the fence is a friend of 'the other side' who approaches adolescence in ways that Graham does.
912;They have the same enthusiasm for air ships.
913;graham's love of flying means that in one scene, he salutes the Japanese pilots.
914;He still has a lot of growing up to do, since he remains unaware of the life style differences that lie between the American opportunist and the British upper.
915;He touches his mother's face.
916;They hug and the look on his face shows relief.
917;He has lived beyond love and softness and privilege, and his look causes the viewer to wonder if it is too late for him to relate to love and softness, ever again.
918;Empire of the Sun is the charming yet frequently haunting tale of the casualties of war.
919;"Spielberg never gets the credit he deserves for this film
I:8942;920;pounding action sequences and creatures he's better.
I:8942;921;But it is also a film capable of getting inside one's head (and heart) and staying there, one you remember months and years after seeing it, and it captures without over.
I:8942;922;cheeked young boy with a fiercely aristocratic English accent and the gleeful twinkle of zest for life in his eyes.
I:8942;923;school boy of twelve to a hardened, almost feral survivor of fifteen is remarkable for its believability and natural feel"
924;Jim grows up before our eyes, almost without us realizing it until the change is so complete that we can barely remember the plucky, rosy.
925;His eyes in particular are brilliant at drawing the viewer in: they can be wide and enraptured or tear.
926;filled or coolly calculating but always demand our attention, making us feel what he feels.
927;but Bale handles it with artful aplomb and vitality.
928;he is supported by a remarkable set of actors, particularly John Malkovich in a rare role as the good guy Basie, and Miranda Richardson as a delicate Englishwoman who takes Jim under her wing in the camp.
929;"I quite liked the relationship between Basie and Jim
I:8942;930;the film looks beautiful too: Spielberg can frame a shot like no one else, and his remarkable talents are on display here as much as in any of his other work.
I:8942;931;ups particularly are put to excellent use: Spielberg has extraordinary actors at his disposal here and is wise enough to sometimes let their faces do the talking.
I:8942;932;The feel of the locales, whether it is 1940s Shanghai, the British Enclave, or the Japanese prison camp, is wonderfully captured.
I:8942;933;i think perhaps this film is often overlooked because it doesn't seem to take sides"
934;"dry mentality that WWII inspires in viewers, and that is reflected in Spielberg's own ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a far inferior film to this."
935;Empire of the Sun is unlike, really, any other film Spielberg has made, but it is for this reason I feel it is his finest achievement: restrained, elegant, yet passionate, it is a beautiful story that engages the attention and imagination and stays with one long after the credits roll.
936;In my opinion, Spielberg's best film and one of the best I've ever seen in my life.
937;In addition, the undoubtedly best performance played ever in a movie by a child.
938;Besides, the rest of the cast, the photography and the music are totally stunning.
939;and he has.:)This movie has stayed with me all these years, especially the haunting look in his eyes at the end.
940;"On the surface, Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" seems like a deceptively simple and earnest coming."
941;and yet it is more, o so much more, substantial.
942;Empire of the Sun is a resonant, realistic film of epic proportions.
943;biographical novel of the same name by J. g Ballard, is a film remarkable not only for the power of the story it tells, but the also for the depth of of it's characters, namely the protagonist, Jamie (James) Graham.
944;"Burgess was referring specifically to the art of fiction, and yet his statement is exemplified perfectly by ""Empire of the Sun""."
945;Another accomplishment for Spielberg (and one made all the more impressive by the fact that this is one of his early efforts, made before he achieved wide.
946;At it's simplest level, we are watching the emotional evolution of the human animal, and it is exciting, because not only does it allow us to identify with similar journeys we have all taken at some point or other in our lives, but feeds a primitive hunger and thirst for adventure and experience as well.
947;Empire of the Sun is a very poetic film, filled with countless lyric and powerful moments, and highly recommended to all who enjoy an absorbing and entertaining adventure parable.
948;Certainly it is one of my favorite films, and is of the sort that will be interpreted in a multitude of ways by a number of people.
949;Whatever it's flaws, chances are watching this be will be a moving and compelling experience.
950;This is a beautiful, complicated, searing film, and as such can be difficult to watch.
951;Christian Bale is simply extraordinary as Jamie .
952;hands down the finest performance I've ever seen from a child actor, and one of the finest performances I've seen from any actor.
953;He is so utterly vital and alive, and seems nearly to spring from the screen.
954;"(His performance, moreover, is no fluke
I:8942;955;The film is worth seeing for Bale's performance alone, and the beautiful cinematography and score are a bonus.
I:8942;956;Okay, so it's a Steven Spielburg movie, which means it's a given there was talent involved.
I:8942;957;The last 20 minutes was good, but it took a while to get there.
I:8942;958;One scene imparticular moved me and made me feel child like again.
I:8942;959;The music and the wonderful camera movements made me feel like I never have before.
I:8942;960;Watch this movie more than once.
I:8942;961;It touches the heart and you will never forget it.
I:8942;962;They'll steal the scene every time."""""""
963;The immediate peril is that Japanese troops have invaded China.
964;Jim's family flees the advancing troops.
965;Even in crime flicks, where the protagonist is a crook, the crook has a likeable side, something we are drawn to so that we wind up pulling for him.
966;Having Jim behave in a way that few real kids would in real life, is pure audience manipulation and director Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.
967;This is an excellent movie set during the Japanese occupation of China.
968;It's an intriguing story that speaks to the heart.
969;There are a lot of poingnant scenes.
970;Christian Bale does an excellent job developing such a deep character at such a young age.
971;This is such a great movie.
972;Christian Bale is a great actor, even as a child.
973;This is an awesome and amazing movie.
974;The film is brilliant .
975;But hey, the best art can't be forced on people .
976;Empire is much more meaningful than Saving Private Ryan and much more personal and expressive than Schindler's List.
977;Those two oscar winners are the kind of straightforward narrative that are more generally aimed for mass.
978;Although Empire is not so neatly packaged as the excellent Schindler and Ryan films, it is far bolder, more sophisticated, innovative, and for those who can understand it, more POWERFUL!
979;The best art always takesrisks, and thus won't be appreciated by everyone.
980;This movie was touching and worth the money!
981;This is an incredible movie if you haven't already seen it.
982;Empire of the Sun is an inspiring, emotional, and action.
983;packed epic of a small boy in a great war.
984;Jim's love for planes and unconquerable spirit soars high and free above the harsh confines of the camp.
985;empire of the Sun in my eyes is one of Spielberg's best films ever.
986;It is based on the real life experiences of J. g. Ballard and really illustrates what he had to go through.
987;The set designs and shot locations are incredibly realistic to the time period that the film took place in.
988;the friendship that builds between Jim and the rest of the Americans is great.
989;It was the first role of his career and in my opinion it was his best performance.
990;The most incredible thing about it, was the fact that he was just a boy.
991;The role was very demanding, and he did a great job with it.
992;Christian Bale also does a nice job singing along with the musical score in this film.
993;John Malkovich turns in a solid performance as Basie.
994;Basie is the leader of the American soldiers within the camp, and befriends Jim taking him under his wing.
995;I CANNOT recommend this movie enough.
996;this movie was THAT moving (but in a good way, not sappy), yes!
997;A true gem that went WAY under.
998;It's a favorite in my family, but especially my Father's all time favorite (He's a big Steven Speilberg fan).
999;I recommend this movie to anyone who loves watching movies that are truely a masterpiece in the making.
1000;Only Steven Speilberg could have made this movie the way it was captured, and being able to move the audience and touch thir heart.
1001;Christian Bale demonstrates incredible talent at such a young age.
1002;Lots of other great talent as well.
1003;A thought provoking trip with a young boy captured by the Japanese in Singapore in the summer of 1945.
1004;"even though this movie isn't filled with blazing guns and lots of explosions,this has got to be one of the best fictionalized ""Human Drama"" stories of WWII."
1005;It's directed by Steven Spielburg, so it has amazing action scenes and special effects.
1006;During this time, James does a lot of growing and makes friends, including John Malkovich.
1007;I won't give away all the details of this exciting true story, but I highly recommend it.
1008;Spielberg explores concepts such as friendship, loyalty and .
1009;courage, and comes up with a movie which might well be one of his best pictures ever.
1010;And it gets better with each viewing.
1011;Christian Bale (whom some of you may know from American Psycho and Batman Begins) made his breakthrough in this movie, playing the lead role with an assurance and maturity that quite takes your breath away.
1012;The music is first rate.
1013;It has WAY more substance and depth.
1014;when I first saw this I thought it was a bit long, but with the benefit of a few repeat viewings it's actually just right.
1015;This is not so much a film as an epic journey of the heart.
1016;A truly amazing and beautiful film.
1017;An excellent job was done by the actors, the directors and the entire production team.
1018;It is heart wrenching and truly makes you feel for the boy.
1019;This film is a true masterpiece and never got the accolades it deserved.
1020;Christian Bale is amazing acting well beyond his years in this film , John Malkovich was solid as ever as the american pirate.
1021;The visuals of this film are incredible the scene when Jim watches the americans bombing the Shainghai docks at night ,and the scene where P.51 mustangs are bombing the airfield that they were forced to build.
1022;Speilberg was at his usual best when he made this film thats why its such a mystery that this film was'nt more appreciated.
1023;With the exception of Schindler's List and Jaws Steven Spielberg's films have always been a ham.
1024;Here working from dark material by J. g. BALLRAD wholly unsuitable for his purpose the film is wonderful almost despite his efforts to turn the story into sentimental slush.
1025;Spielberg ofcourse ignores this and goes for a big emotional moment with swelling music and tearful close.
1026;And for all my complaints about Spielberg's handling of the dramatic side of this film, the man is without a doubt a visual master.
1027;The film is a wonder to look at even when the impressive visuals are at complete odds with what is being said.
1028;Throw in a fixating performance by Christian Bale, and the always ace Malckovich and you have yourself a must see.
1029;I didn't realize that Christian Bale was in this film and I believe his performance alone makes it worth seeing!
1030;The film is well produced and the cast is excellent, but I did find some scenes to be a bit too long.
1031;There is also a lot of Japanese Dialogue without sub.
1032;it's a good film, but it's not perfect.
1033;Bale's terrific in this and he is truly gifted!HAPPY 4TH OF JULY EVERYBODY!
1034;J. g. Ballard (author)My absolutely favourite film of all time and it's Spielberg.
1035;so awesome he stars in a film about John Malcovich.
1036;is in this movie and I shall, for I need, say no more on that score.
1037;I love Leslie Philips the old rouge), Nigel Havers (beloved of the French.
1038;P51, Cadillac of the skies, whereas it was.yer well you know what I'm about to say by now.
1039;An excellent film which was shipped promptly by Amazon.
1040;"This is a great movie
I:8942;1041;It's the best Spielberg movie I've seen, and I highly recommend it to everyone out there in front of your computer screens.
I:8942;1042;My 14 year old son enjoyed this movie and learned a lot about WWII.
I:8942;1043;He was surprised a very young Christian Bale in the starring role.
I:8942;1044;A great and unique film about WW II Japanese invasion of Singapore.
I:8942;1045;One of the best war films I've ever seen.
I:8942;1046;You will laugh and cry.
I:8942;1047;The outcome displayed a great amount of perseverance, and endurance.
I:8942;1048;This movie is simply brilliant.
I:8942;1049;I recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8942;1050;Excellent film One of my favorites also !!
I:8942;1051;Such a good story about a young boy, who in the midst of an attack by Japan, is caught up in the mess that war causes.
I:8942;1052;This movie is in my top ten movies of all time.
I:8942;1053;He does a wonderful job.
I:8942;1054;I highly recommend this movie
I:8942;1055;EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a gem of movie.
I:8942;1056;Visually arresting from start to finish, given a sumptuous musical score by John Williams and some of the finest cinematography ever seen, it is hard to understand why the film is not as highly acclaimed as it ought to be.
I:8942;1057;it's a sweeping epic but depends on capturing your interest by giving the main burden to the young Christian Bale who certainly has one of the great child roles of a lifetime as Jim.
I:8942;1058;pack of prisoners interred by the Japanese.
I:8942;1059;It is a spectacularly staged evacuation scene that is topped throughout by other scenes of visual splendor and poignant moments that stay in the memory long after the film is over.
I:8942;1060;The boy's fascination with the beauty of planes and the horrors of war are well documented.
I:8942;1061;technically, the film is a brilliant achievement in all of its World War II details.
I:8942;1062;And Christian Bale certainly deserved an Oscar for what has to be one of the strongest performances ever given by a child actor, with never a false step, every nuance just perfect.
I:8942;1063;From the point of view of a foreign boy, the film provides insight into how China and foreigners living there were ill.
I:8942;1064;treated by the Japanese during WWII.
I:8942;1065;The narrative is rich with humor, calamity and adventure.
I:8942;1066;A young Christian Bale plays Jamie Graham, and his performance is energetic and convincing.
I:8942;1067;Not the best movie ever made, but the P.51 scene towards the end of the movie IS one of the best ever.
I:8942;1068;Just breathtaking, the Mustang is.
I:8942;1069;This movie shows a pampered young rich boyput into a surviver mode by the Japanese occupation of China.
I:8942;1070;He is resorceful and able not only to survive dire circumstances, but help others along the way.
I:8942;1071;The story line is based in occupied China, on J. G. Ballard's semi.
I:8942;1072;autobiographical novel this movie is a marvel to behold.
I:8942;1073;a young Christian Bale makes his movie debut, with John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, and Nigel Havers in supporting excellent roles!!
I:8942;1074;The actors act very well, but the boy's behaviors and lots of scenes are cnfusing in the movie.
I:8942;1075;I do not recommend it to anyone.
I:8942;1076;and it is an adaptation, make no mistake, taking many creative liberties.
I:8942;1077;I'm honestly not a huge spielberg fan.
I:8942;1078;I like his early works.
I:8942;1079;If you like WWII dramas (not for battle scenes, although you will find them here also), but the human dramas, you must see this classic.
I:8942;1080;Set the story aside and simply revel in the unique visuals that this film offers such as watching Japanese Warships shell Shanghai from atop a high.
I:8942;1081;The spectacle of P.51's strafing the adjacent air base and Jim shouting with crazed glee """"P.51 Cadillac of the Sky"""" is unforgettable."""
1082;And the scene of the Hiroshima blast is unforgettable.
1083;This movie draws me to watch it again and again.
1084;I'm sure you'll take away a scene from this film that will replay itself in your mind for some quite time.
1085;I am happy with what I got so I will say it is good.
1086;Very moving history and beautifully done.
1087;camp since the Fall of Hongkong in 1941, and yet knows all about the P51 Mustang fighter, obviously from the well.
1088;This movie has so many outstanding gifts.
1089;that in itself makes this movie a wonderfully fascinating experience of this young mans ability to survive.
1090;this movie is a wealth of education for the young people to see and experience.
1091;analyzed and used as a study discussion vehicle.
1092;so as to strengthen, and bring our young people into the experiences.
1093;an awesome movie!I gave this as a gift.
1094;Christian Bale gives the finest acting job of anyone his age.
1095;A must for thoughtful movie watchers.
1096;It is my personal opinion that Empire of the Sun is one of the greatest movies ever created, and does not recieve enough credit for its stunning story, gripping plot, and amazing acting.
1097;I liked the movie until they got to the main camp and you see people playing golf and women doing laundry like there at weekend camp site.
1098;This is a good movie.
1099;I have been a huge fan of Christian Bale for years.
1100;His acting in this movie is incredible.
1101;This story has a lot of connections emotionally and mentally for me.
1102;there are a lot of paralles in our stories.
1103;John Malkovich was the perfect foil in a great period piece.
1104;There's a terrific story by J G Ballard in the middle of this movie and Spielberg missed it.
1105;An amazing amount of talent down the drain.
1106;This is an excellent depiction of WWII occupation by the Japanese of Shanghai, China, and their treatment of the British and American expatriates and the indigenous Chinese people.
1107;This is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, much underrated at the time it came out.
1108;The main theme of the film, in my opinion, is the emotional and psychological impact of war on civilians and children in particular.
1109;In that sense, the film leaves a lasting and indelible impression.
1110;This film is one of the best that I've ever seen and has become my favorite film.
1111;I have viewed it more than once!
1112;The visuals are strikingly beautiful and well done and the music by John Williams is superb.
1113;I recommend this to anyone, ages 13 and up who wants a better understanding of war and this particular segment of World War II history.
1114;this is a moving film about a boy who is seperated from his family in singapore during the second world war.
1115;the film then shows how he survives in a japanese prison camp.
1116;brilliant and very moving film.
1117;It has brilliant acting, wonderful cinematography, and a story and characters that just hook you in from the get.
1118;Christian Bale gives the best child.
1119;actor performance I have ever seen, and the supporting cast is great, especially Miranda Richardson and John Malkovich.
1120;known movies is arguably his masterpiece, the most visually poetic film since Lawrence of Arabia, and possibly ever.
1121;It contains literally stunning images and sequences, not for their scenic beauty but for their emotional impact and Spielberg's genius at composition and at telling stories with pictures.
1122;Spielberg at the peak of his talent devises images and sequences unlike anything else in the movies.
1123;Another, which follows shortly thereafter, involves the son, Jim (future Oscar.
1124;winner Christian Bale, in a terrific debut role .
1125;In yet another, Jim, who is fascinated with aircraft, spots a Japanese Zero on the ground and approaches it.
1126;A mechanic is welding part of the fighter and the sparks create the effect of a shower of stars.
1127;"controlled models, the sequence is likely to take your breath away
I:8942;1128;Beautifully shot by Alan Daviau, and featuring a magnificent score by John Williams, this movie will haunt you long after the fadeout .
I:8942;1129;I've always loved this film, was very glad to see it available on Prime.
I:8942;1130;(Sam Waterston plays Schanberg, and Dr. Haing S. Ngor is Dith Pran, winning a much deserved """"Best Supporting Actor"""" for his first film role.)"""
1131;"both directors convey a great sense of place
I:8942;1132;i give both movies four and a half stars.
I:8942;1133;This is one of my wife's favorite movies, and for a good reason!
I:8942;1134;making on a grand scale.
I:8942;1135;Amazing use of available light.
I:8942;1136;When I mentioned on a forum that I enjoyed the book, another forum member mentioned the movie.
I:8942;1137;I usually have found movies made from books to be very disappointing, but in this case I was impressed with how well the movie followed the book.
I:8942;1138;Years ago, I saw the movie and loved it.
I:8942;1139;ray now and appreciate it more!
I:8942;1140;The young Christian Bale acting is of Oscar.
I:8942;1141;Most of all, the story is very compelling, from a small childs view of the great WWII in China, involving four countries (China, Japan, England, and America).
I:8942;1142;It may not be politically correct, but is politically true.
I:8942;1143;Yet, he acted as morally possible as he could during the wartime a noble soul, as we all possess within (how we act out.
I:8942;1144;this is not only an epic movie, but also a deep discussion on human nature, morality, life and death, and the relation with The Higher Power (God in this movie).
I:8942;1145;it is interesting that Jim cited in Latin during his tried times (he learned when he attended a Catholic school).
I:8942;1146;i am moved and touched by the story, and felt the triumphs and despairs wholeheartedly as Jim went on his life adventures.
I:8942;1147;Spielberg paid great attention to details, in lines and in scenes.
I:8942;1148;ray version brings wonderful colors, high definition, and fantastic sound to the movie A successful transfer from the 1987 original.
I:8942;1149;it is a totally enjoyable movie, whether you enter it from the shallower or deeper end.
I:8942;1150;Empire Of The Sun is one of Steven Spielberg's least successful films.
I:8942;1151;Unlike some of his other commercial failures (1941 Hook to name two), Empire Of The Sun is an excellent film.
I:8942;1152;Christian Bale is outstanding as the twelve.year boy and his transformation from pampered rich kid to a streetwise survivor is stunning.
I:8942;1153;John Malkovich is equally brilliant as the boy's mentor.
I:8942;1154;The movie was generally panned at the time of its release in 1987, but in the fourteen years after its release, it has gained the respect it so richly deserved at the time.
I:8942;1155;Filmed on a grand scale using actors who can act and a screenplay that does not pander to the lowest common denominator.
I:8942;1156;This is a wonderfully constructed and acted movie.
I:8942;1157;based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical book of the same name, the movie is actually better than the book.
I:8942;1158;it has the virtues of a REALLY good novel.
I:8942;1159;the characters are sharp and interesting, and they develop believably.
I:8942;1160;the movie is a stunning indictment of war.
I:8942;1161;even the """"good"""" war, WWII."""
1162;and the movie contains by far Christian Bale's best acting: he actually moves and displays emotion.
1163;I had this in my queue for a couple of years and finally decided to watch it with my family.
1164;It was the most amazing performance by a child that we've ever seen.
1165;He was heartbreaking and funny and hopeful and sweet.
1166;"He's a guy you'd want with you because he has the most base survival instinct of an animal
I:8942;1167;The way their relationship plays out is fascinating.
I:8942;1168;this movie was amazing and the story is so compelling that as soon as the movie ended I bought the book.
I:8942;1169;I was surprised to learn that the story is basically true .
I:8942;1170;autobiographical book to the screen with artistry and passion, preserving its unsettling, matter.
I:8942;1171;Unique and compelling with stunning imagery and soaring music by John Willilams, Empire of the Sun is a moving experience not to be missed by movie fans of any persuasion.
I:8942;1172;Although the book shows a negative view and the movie shows a positive view of the spirit, in my opinion Spielberg did the right thing in making the movie as he did.
I:8942;1173;When the supplies are dropped and the boy finally gets something good to eat at the end of the war is a scene that really sticks with me.
I:8942;1174;I'm telling you, this is one of the greatest movies ever made about war and the human spirit.
I:8942;1175;Every time I watch it I cry.
I:8942;1176;and feel good about it!
I:8942;1177;This is a Steven Spielberg movie and follows his superb reputation as being a great movie.
I:8942;1178;The background music is good too.
I:8942;1179;I found this movie to be beautiful, poignant, and perhaps amazing.
I:8942;1180;Then I read here on Amazon that it was basically the first movie in Spielberg's war trilogy that included Shindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, two of my favorite movies.
I:8942;1181;The movie was not depressing, it was incredibly touching.
I:8942;1182;second, even though the film is based upon a novel, the film is pure Spielberg storytelling.
I:8942;1183;With amazing detail Spielberg demonstrates the chaotic turmoil war inflicts upon the life of one boy about to enter adolescence.
I:8942;1184;Although the boy is forced to mature quickly to become a survivor, he holds tight to his one boyhood love throughout the movie"
1185;As a former Navy pilot maybe I could relate a little too much, but the scene when he first touches an airplane in the presence of pilots is Spielberg at his absolute finest, a scene that will stay with me for a long time.
1186;wiser people than me say people, places, and things come into our lives at just the right moment when we either need them or can appreciate them the most.
1187;"After twenty four years I'm thankful ""Empire of the Sun"" is now part of my life and I truly appreciate the artistic expression Spielberg created with the movie."
1188;Although one of Spielberg's least successful efforts, this underrated film follows the WWII adventures of a 12 year old named Jim (brilliant portrayed by Christian Bale), caught in the throes of the fall of China.
1189;The British boy, living a well.
1190;class child to an imprisoned, desperate, and feral boy, is stunning.
1191;Bale's impressive performance is supported by powerful sets, cinematography, and potent, sometime overbearing soundtrack by John Williams.
1192;based on the autobiography by J. g. Ballard, Spielberg turned EMPIRE OF THE SUN into a sweeping war drama that marked his own first steps of artistic growth towards his future epics Saving Private Ryan, and Schiendler's.
1193;Having read a number of histories of the struggles in the Pacific, this film is a visual awakening for history buffs.
1194;It is extremly well done as a tale through the eyes of a youngster who lived to tell the story.
1195;i strongly recommend this film.
1196;It tells a probable true story of the life and times of those taken up in the empire building of the orient.
1197;There is little foulness of language associaded with modern cultural pagan Hollywood so it is a delight to watch if for no other reason.
1198;the tale of two young boys, each on the other side of a barbed wire fence, is compelling.
1199;Empire of the Sun is one of the few movies that makes my eyes water with tears throughout the screenplay.
1200;The movie contains classic visual montages such as the harrowing car ride through mob.
1201;Spielberg's vision was never sharper, and the words and music never more piercing.
1202;Yet despite this artistry and heart.
1203;And what a wonderful movie this is.
1204;It is fascinating film and I enjoyed it very much.
1205;A wonderful movie, with many typical Spielberg touches.
1206;Overall fantastic, but it might be a bit slow in parts for some viewers.
1207;this is one during which you have to settle in, to enjoy for its character portraits and history.Young Christiam Bale is amazing in his portrayal of Jamie.
1208;And no one does crowd panic scenes like Spielberg.
1209;It is a story of triumph, an hommage to the resilient child who never gave up Hope.
1210;It is a wonderful, moving, amazing story with the great performance of young Christian Bale and impecable John Malcovich.
1211;This epic film is the first of Spielberg's World War II trilogy that includes Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.
1212;Spielberg tells a beautiful story of the horrors of war, how families are uprooted and separated, and how the human spirit overcomes adversity.
1213;Christian Bale is superb in the film.
1214;John Malkovich is his usual fantastic self as a fellow POW who becomes Bale's Long John Silver, a sly comparison to the classic Treasure Island.
1215;The film is beautifully photographed and has a subtle and moving score from Spielberg stalwart John Williams.
1216;It is a must for fans of the director and those who appreciate masterful storytelling.
1217;One of the best hidden gem movies ever produced.
1218;I hope more people will become aware of this great achievement by Spielberg as a director and Christian Bale's first movie role.
1219;The transfer to blu ray is absolutely seamless.
1220;I got this as a gift for my sister.
1221;It is one of her favorite movies and she had had it on her wish list for Christmas.
1222;It is very entertaining yet very sad.
1223;I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who would like to know some of war's ugly sides.
1224;This is Spielbergs overlooked masterpiece.
1225;The acting is great, the story powerful, and the music incredible.
1226;Jim encounters a young Japanese boy whose plane has gone over the fence and befriends him also, this is the first time Jim sees the power of the Japanese planes and he respects them.
1227;This is a great movie that deserves the respect that Spielbergs newer movies have gotten.
1228;This is one of the best dramas I have ever seen.
1229;Christian Bale gives a remarkable performance as a boy who goes from a priviledged existence to a struggle to survive the occupation.
1230;John Malkovich is convincing as a coldblooded, hustling American merchant caught up in the Japanese invasion who manipulates Bale's character for his own benefit.
1231;the scale and ambition of the film is huge and some of the scenes of the evacuation and bombing are incredibly well done.
1232;overall a rewarding film about a part of WWII that has been explored less by Hollywood than the European war.
1233;screened it and came away convinced that it is one of the best war films I have ever seen.
1234;heroic characters and a sensitive, energetic child who understands he must survive and whose point of view is the most important in the film.
1235;The boy is tempted by his charisma and natural leadership, to the point that he risks his life to impress him, and then faces another decision at the end of the war.
1236;There is also a wonderful contrast between the British and American communities in the camps, food for discussion on their respective cultures (an issue in my family as I am American and my wife British).
1237;But it also has a thoughtful and thought.
1238;Christian Bale as the young hero gives a wonderful performance as does John Malkovich.
1239;As usual, the John Williams score is hauntingly beautiful and integral to the story.
1240;never let us take for granted the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of freedom.
1241;that is invested in all of us and all our loved ones, preciously inherited perhaps, but never granted, always won.
1242;if Mr. Spielberg is available, would he please take a bow, just about.
1243;I like period pieces and this was a decent one.
1244;Excellent cast and well acted.
1245;On the same day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, they also rounded up all the American and British residents of Shanghai and put them in prison camps.
1246;"EMPIRE OF THE SUN, is Ballard's story and arguably Steven Spielberg's most personal and revealing film and the first of his WW II trilogy that continues with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."
1247;Originally dismissed by the public and the majority of critics, this underrated and poignant film asks and answers the question: What if you once had everything and lost it all in a single afternoon?
1248;"There is however en extra on this disc, ""The China Odyssey: Empire of the Sun,"" a wonderful behind."
1249;the scenes documentary (credited to Spielberg) that shows the director at work along with historical footage of the fall of China when it was occupied by the Japanese.
1250;"Empire of the Sun was Spielberg's admittedly first attempt to helm ""a mature story a la a David Lean type epic."""
1251;These and many other shots reveal a lot about Spielberg's love of pure cinema and the difficulty of growing up in a world where reality can shatter the dream and thus the need to remain emotionally distant to real events .
1252;There's a lot of Spielberg in this widescreen Rorschach test.
1253;"Empire of the Sun is to Spielberg what ""Vertigo"" was to Hitchcock."
1254;It's a remarkable achievement and a brilliant, complex film worth adding to the digital home library.
1255;There is some fine acting, a very fine script and great photographyin this griping epic of a young boy's survival against the odds in aninternment camp.
1256;I reviewer the book above.
1257;Christian Bale is an amazing actor and should be appreciated more than he is.
1258;I loved all of the Batman movies and I liked American Hustle.
1259;He sure didn't look like himself in that movie but he was amazing.
1260;I would recommend it for ages 15 and up, because the ravages of war are very graphic.
1261;Spielberg it obtains one of its greater successes with this Movie.
1262;history is narrated of reliable and vertiginous way, and within the same one it excels the performance of John Malkovich and Christian Bale.
1263;Since this, is best movie of the director.
1264;This movie is truly one of Mr. Spielberg's best.
1265;If not the first then one of the first movies with Christian BaleVery well produced .
1266;iconic sceneWatch it you will love it
1267;"perhaps a faint shadow of a Japanese Zero and a P.51 flying underneath him reminding us that humans can transcend personal and national hatreds and soar
I:8942;1268;But """"Empire of the Sun"""" is altogether another story, perhaps his most complex and sophisticated, watchable and rewatchable film."""
1269;First of all, it's a coming.
1270;There isn't any enemy, no bad guys and good guys: there are only planes and the pilots who fly them, concentration camps and courageous and resourceful people who manage to bear it out to the edge of doom, and then beyond.
1271;In one particularly moving scene he joins in with a kamikaze pre.
1272;She joins him in a prone position, Spielberg does a time dissolve back to her dead body illuminated by an eerily bright sky, and the boy interprets the sign as God's welcoming her to heaven.
1273;"Later we find the ""scientific"" explanation for the source of the light."
1274;Spielberg has pulled out all the stops of his technical cinematic magic, unashamedly embraced a melodramatic mode in its truest sense (drama with music), and produced a work of singular imagination: it's equal parts realism and fantasy, toughness and soul, heroism and redemption, courage and grace.
1275;Personally I think that it's a unique movie and in its way a masterpiece, but not easy to understand.
1276;Indeed to understand well the movie it's good to read the book `Empire of the Sun' by J. Ballard ( one of the most important and controversial writers of our age ).
1277;As the book does, also in the movie, things and facts are distorted by the point if view of a child with a lot of imagination.
1278;The Movie is full of these hallucinations and symbols.
1279;He become what they call `the war child' and they despise him because he has learned to enjoy the camp.
1280;Again what we see is not a real representation of Japanese pilots, what we see in the movie is the dream like image of the Japanese pilots in Jim's mind, an idealized representation of the solitary and brave men he admires , dreaming to be one of them.
1281;I think that it was very difficult to transfer a so deep and dark book in a satisfactory movie, but Spielberg did a very good job with the story and with the young actor.
1282;For me, this is one of the best movies I ever saw, but it's not a movie for everyone.
1283;If, after watching the movie, you feel a deep sadness and you are willing to watch it again, as it happens to me, then you entered in the spirit of the movie.
1284;I did enjoy viewing this movie!
1285;The acting,setting and plot were entertaining.
1286;Empire of the Sun is an amazing movie!
1287;Christian Bale is phenomenal in this movie!
1288;The music and visuals are stunning also.
1289;This movie shows this and keeps the images in your head for years to come.
1290;"This movie is one of the reasons that I decided to become a history major in college
I:8942;1291;This is a Spielberg movie that came out before Schindler's List, and I wonder if that has something to do with the lack of critical respect that it deserved.
I:8942;1292;While it had some of the classic Spielberg whimsy and flash, the storyline and acting were excellent.
I:8942;1293;Though not on par with the likes of Out of Africa and a A Passage to India, there is something in this movie that is just as epic as those two films.
I:8942;1294;Christian Bale's performance was amazing"
1295;John Williams soundtrack for this movie is one of his best.
1296;Europeans caught in between the Chinese and Japanese during World War II is an interesting aspect of the movie, duplicated somewhat in a more recent movie The White Countess.
1297;It really is a good film and I highly recommend it.
1298;Loved this movie as a kid and still enjoy it as an adult.
1299;I still remember seeing this movie when it was first released.
1300;Went with some friends who wanted to see it, and I didn't know anything about it.
1301;This is my favorite Spielberg movie.
1302;Filmed in China, it beautifully depicts in full detail a part of WWII that is seldom viewed.
1303;This is a great classic movie with John Malkovich and Christian bale for the acting, cinematography and sound track.
1304;Good for kids who are closer to teens because of the strong themes of war.
1305;Movie was in great shape.
1306;Great history intertwined with the story.
1307;"I never understood why the movie was so poorly regarded then
I:8942;1308;I loved this movie when I was a kid so I found it on Amazon now I can watch whenever I choose!
I:8942;1309;This movie has been one of my favorite movies ever since I saw it in the theater with mom and dad.
I:8942;1310;Thirteen years later I'm still in love with this movie and still slightly upset that both the movie and Spielburg never got the credit they should have.
I:8942;1311;The soundtrack (altough I don't listen to classical) is possibly even better than the movie.
I:8942;1312;James Rainbird gives a stunning vocal proformance.
I:8942;1313;How this movie ever got skipped over is truly beyond me.
I:8942;1314;One of the few movies I can watch time and again.
I:8942;1315;The framing sequence in Saving Private Ryan , the precocious kids in any number of his films.
I:8942;1316;And to be fair, there are a couple of those moments in Empire.
I:8942;1317;That said, I feel that this is easily his most restrained work.
I:8942;1318;(Fun fact: Bale does the voice of Thomas, the nervous young soldier in Disney's Pocahontas )Props must also go to the stellar supporting cast, led by the (as always) brilliant John Malkovich.
I:8942;1319;And John Williams' epic and unforgettable score almost plays a physical part in this film.
I:8942;1320;It's easily one of the most moving and memorable scores in recent decades.
I:8942;1321;To me, this film completely established Spielberg as a truly great director, rather than a merely successful director.
I:8942;1322;Empire is an Art film that succeeds in a fairly linear context.
I:8942;1323;The casting was one of many brilliant components, with a young Christian Bale delivering what was probably the finest performance by a child actor in the history of the film industry.
I:8942;1324;He also proved exceptional a few years later in the Charlton Heston.
I:8942;1325;autobiographical book, but then so did director Sally Potter when she made the utterly stunning film version of Virginia Woolf's Orlando.
I:8942;1326;This is perhaps the clearest indication that these Industry parasites who do not have the intelligence or the ability or even the courage to create something of their own, cannot recognize true genius even when it is right in front of their piggy eyes.
I:8942;1327;one of the best films of any genre I have ever seen.
I:8942;1328;I bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts.
I:8942;1329;But I have written to them and requested that they watch it right away and get back to me if there is a problem.
I:8942;1330;I liked this movie since i was small, so its great.
I:8942;1331;I recommend it, see what you think.
I:8942;1332;I plan on getting one of those new LED Samsung's and hopefully it will come out in Blue.
I:8942;1333;I logged onto the amazon.
I:8942;1334;Maybe it's the fact that upon any sort of character development I like to become emotionally attached to the story and actually care what will happen next.
I:8942;1335;I have loved this since I was a kid.
I:8942;1336;I thought it was an outstanding movie and then found it on Amazon and ordered it.
I:8942;1337;I've loved this film from the first time I saw it.
I:8942;1338;By their very nature they are more complex than films and go into much greater detail (If The Hunt for Red October had followed every detail of the book it would have been a 5 or 6 hour movie), yet here Spielberg, in the time allotted, weaves a compelling story of a young boy learning to survive in a very contradictory world.
I:8942;1339;To him, while WWII China is horrifying, he still finds in it a sense of adventure.
I:8942;1340;The young actor, Christian Bale, who plays the lead turns in a very convincing performance and John Malkovich and Nigel Havers are excellent in supporting roles.
I:8942;1341;The soundtrack is worth picking up also for the Welsh hymn Suo Gan and the closing choral music.
I:8942;1342;All in all a superior piece of film.
I:8942;1343;One of my top ten favorite movies.
I:8942;1344;Glad I bought it and have in my small collection.
I:8942;1345;I have watched it many times and will watch it again.
I:8942;1346;Christian Bale is excellent as is Malcovich and others.
I:8942;1347;this is a truly gorgeous film, beautifully shot with tremendous acting by the entire cast.
I:8942;1348;I agree with others that Christian Bale is superb.
I:8942;1349;Malkovitch is outstanding as well.
I:8942;1350;so many memorable momments: overseeing the adult couple making love, the saluting of the Japanese fighter pilot, the toy airplane at the custom party, the slap by the servant who is caught looting Jim's house.
I:8942;1351;The end of the movie was perfect.
I:8942;1352;this is one of my top 100 movies, if not top 50.
I:8942;1353;i hope you enjoy it when you see it.
I:8942;1354;Have this on VHS but just packed it away and thought well I wont get to watch this anymore, then saw this deal and couldnt resist getting it.
I:8942;1355;The seal of approval that author J. G. Ballard gives to this production speaks volumes for the treatment given to this incredible story.
I:8942;1356;But when the Japanese invade Shanghai, he suddenly finds himself alone and having to fend for himself.
I:8942;1357;inevitably, Jim and his new found companions are interned and it is in Soochow Creek Prison Camp he really learns to survive, finds courage in pursuit of doing what is right and earns genuine respect from his captors.
I:8942;1358;jim is a complex child but under the guiding hand of Steven Spielberg, Christian Bale delivers all of the traits and emotions that make up this character in a powerful performance .
I:8942;1359;the supporting cast is equally well chosen and combine to make Empire of the Sun what it is .
I:8942;1360;a 5 star movie of astonishing brilliance.
I:8942;1361;To not see it is to deprive yourself of a real piece of cinematic excellence.
I:8942;1362;This is a spectacular story and as usual, Spielberg touches this piece with his excellent story telling.
I:8942;1363;Use it in history class.
I:8942;1364;It does so much more than just telling about a boy in war.
I:8942;1365;good movie, my wife's family was in that internment camp during the war, it was very interesting to see what they went through.
I:8942;1366;This is a wonderful movie with cinemetography that is awesome.
I:8942;1367;Christian Bale was EXCELLENT as a child actor, it's amazing how perfect he is in the lead role.
I:8942;1368;This is one or those rare movies that will move you, and leave you awestruck at its storyline.
I:8942;1369;It's classic Spielberg, where the children are the innocent visionaries and all adults are corrupt.
I:8942;1370;This film has a permanent place in my top ten, sandwiched between Wild Strawberries and Breaking the Waves.
I:8942;1371;This is the perfect role for Malkovich who just this year traded in his trademark sneer for a baffling, doelike look of vulnerability that must have something to do with middle age.
I:8942;1372;All that remains of his childhood is his fascination with flight.
I:8942;1373;Jim, formerly trading on his priviledged childhood, is now in the business of surviving.
I:8942;1374;Then there's the extraordinary trek through what looks like the Gobi to the stadium in which the dazed POWs stumble among the spoils of war, the former trappings of imperialism.
I:8942;1375;top score by John Williams to shame.
I:8942;1376;There is, at least, the veneer of restraint.
I:8942;1377;This is a beautifully photographed film.
I:8942;1378;it is an interesting movie about his survival and it is based on a true story.
I:8942;1379;I chose this rating cause not only is it a good movie, but Amazon delivered it quickly.
I:8942;1380;A WWII era theme and great music.
I:8942;1381;words to accurately describe this movie escape me.
I:8942;1382;I honestly can't think of a thing to recommend this movie!
I:8942;1383;but even it is wasted) For a really good movie about the Japanese occupation of China I recommend """"Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre""""."""
1384;a far superior and grittier movie than this nonsense!
1385;After viewing the film a couple times I then read most of the reviews.
1386;It will open up a world of understanding about this film.
1387;"John William's fabulous sound track, especially his composition of ""Exsultate Justi."""
1388;"The rich treble voice of James Rainbird singing ""Suo Gan."""
1389;It is an excellent portrayal that follows one British family and their son.
1390;Christian Bale is perfect for the role of the boy left behind.
1391;Saw this when I was a preteen in the 80's, but have a new appreciation for it as an adult.
1392;Beautiful photography, interesting history, and a message worth repeating.
1393;All the actors did a great job as well as the crew.
1394;last viewed about 12 years ago, i found it very impressive
1395;We found the movie to be engaging and informative.
1396;A young Christian Bale is outstanding as Jim, a young boy adrift in the panic as the war with Japan flares into reality.
1397;I saw this film when it first came out, and reviewing it again this time, I liked it even more.
1398;The plot is great and the fact that the kid loves Japanese Zero fighter planes even as a capitive of the Japanese makes for an interesting perspective.
