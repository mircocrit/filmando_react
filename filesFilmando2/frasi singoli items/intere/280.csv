1;I just got done watching HITCH.
2;I really enjoyed this movie.
3;It was kind of cheesy at times, but overall it was really good.
4;I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a nice, light romantic comedy.
5;i saw this movie before in theaters and it was very good.
6;will smith was very hilarious in this movie and i hope he makes another one like this.

12;will smith was very hilarious in this movie and i hope he makes another one like this.
13;you just slide, you just slide, wild wild west, gettin' jiggy withit .
14;The scene is funny cuz white guys don't know how to dance, get it?
15;And finally, this movie has one part .
16;but the best part of this movie is the surprise ending!
17;He can fight aliens, robots, true love, and still always bring his own identity to the big screen.
18;This movie was a true mix of emotions.
19;This movie has a unique twist on comedy, love, and the never ending search for something you feel is out of reach.
20;And so many of us can relate to this movie it was just fabulously plotted, well scripted, and done perfectly.
21;By far I feel it is Will Smith's best work yet.
22;Hitch is one of my wife's favorite movies, and I found it to be an entertaining and somewhat unique movie.
23;It breaks from many of the standard 'chick flick' conventions and is a genuinely funny and entertaining romantic comedy.
24;Because the movie serves as a list of actual information to men about what to do, or not to do if they want to have a good chance with women, or increase their percentage of success at least.
25;As always, Will Smith is charming to no end and only helps men who really like women.
26;go ahead and charge a fortune for the movies, but at least make them the best possible.
27;there's a decent chance a Sony exec of some kind will read this, and if so, I hope you have the cajones to do what it takes to make your media platform a success.
28;"but I've seen this movie before and the most memorable example is the 1972 Herbert Ross film based on Woody Allen's stage play ""Play It Again, Sam""."
29;He coaches men on how to be cool.
30;He tells them all the rules of dating.
31;american actor who has a great amount of box.
32;He thought she was the love of his life and he made sure to repeatedly tell her he loves her to which she would appear uncomfortable.
33;So he decides he will help men get the women of their dreams.
34;And I thought it was all done without any big laughs.
35;"Well in theaters there is Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", and if you like animation, and even if you don't, please, please, please go see ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and I also recommend ""Cinderella Man"" and the new ""Star Wars"" movie."
36;Albert is really much more wise in the ways of love than Alex. Who saw that bombshell coming?What little joy there is to be milked from this ancient cow comes through the grace of lovely Allegra, Amber Valletta, and Albert, Kevin James.
37;The character of Allegra is a preposterous concoction, but Ms. Valletta gives it authenticity, quite an achievement.
38;As to Kevin James, this is one fine comic actor who seems completely natural and comfortable on camera.
39;He is both gifted and skilled with a marvelous way of achieving the virtually impossible task of making comedy look easy.
40;Frankly, Smith is likeable and non.
41;hitch the movie, I'll just watch the trailer.
42;This is a funny romantic movie.
43;Will Smith is great in this role.
44;John Goodman and David Spade are a great voice team for this movie.
45;Great story line and lots of adult laughs too.
46;You see, despite a charming story and adorable actors, I didn't especially love it, and I'm not sure why, considering my love for anything featuring Will Smith.
47;will Smith plays the sexy, self.
48;confident lead role of Hitch, a date doctor who only takes on clients who are truly infatuated with a woman for all the right reasons.
49;confident reporter who leads such a rewarding life reporting on celebrities and socialites that she doesn't need a deep meaningful relationship, either.
50;Naturally, they're born for each other.
51;And I'll admit, it was cute and I enjoyed it for the most part.
52;Overall, I'm glad I watched it, because it was sweet, and I'm a sucker for a cute love story.
53;The only good thing I can say about this film is Kevin James was great.
54;Come to think about it, I've enjoyed most of his movies, I think that Wild West one was pretty much a total flop, but other than that, he's done pretty well in the films he's signed up for.
55;i know Will Smith bugs some, but I've always enjoyed his characters and I think he's a good actor (provided he's in the right role).
56;Anyway, back to this one, what was I saying about it?Oh, the chemistry here was good, I liked the co. star, but can't recall her name at the moment, or where I've seen her before, but anyway, this is a good date film, one of those chick flick type movies that guys can enjoy as well.
57;i watched it with my girlfriend, case in point, and while that means I missed a couple scenes along the way, I did enjoy the movie and give it a recommendation.
58;Very enjoyable and entertaining I thoroughly enjoyed some of the truths he revealed and the way he revealed the in the movie.
59;but they are just basic common sense advice on how to successfully date a lady
60;"This film is a perfect ""date"" or anniversary movie."
61;Will Smith is perfect as the date doctor who assists helpless other males find their perfect soulmate.
62;"And it is clear from early on that Smith is not just helping these other guys ""score."""
63;This film is cute, charming, touching .
64;"Also, I always thought that George Clooney was the new ""Cary Grant,"" and he may indeed be."
65;He is absolutely perfect at the smooth, sophisticated banter.
66;No date is perfect and the perfect person for you might be the one you least expect.
67;This movie made me laugh so many times!
68;Really funny and interesting :) .
69;I'm really glad i got it and i would recommend this to everyone i know.
70;"Hitch, Alex Hitchins, is known as the ""date doctor,"" a consultant that helps men create opportunities to captivate the women they fancy."
71;just the all around nice, sincere ones.
72;With Hitch's help Albert's prospects begin to look up, and Hitch finds himself falling for a high.
73;powered New York gossip columnist.
74;will Smith is always a joy to watch, but it's really Kevin James that makes this movie.
75;His schlub act is spot.
76;The physical comedy in this film, from James and Smith, is another highlight.
77;I found myself cackling uncontrollably, and I don't do that in public if I can help it.
78;"As per most ""date"" movies there's a formula:1."
79;While `Hitch' may not be the most original romantic comedy to hit the big screen it's one of the most enjoyable.
80;Will Smith is always entertaining and effortlessly captivating, but this time, with the pairing of the breathtaking beauty known as Eva Mendes and the hilarious Kevin James, Smith is brought to the top of his game.
81;The script is sweet and refreshing, the dialog is smart and funny and the acting is top notch.
82;She keeps proving with each role no matter how thankless that she is more than a pretty face.
83;The real standout though is Kevin James who outdoes himself.
84;I've always loved James' standup and his show `The King of Queens' but here he really blows me away with his natural charm and humor.
85;With Hitch's help Albert begins to woo Allegra and a mutual attraction between the two is formed.
86;All is good though and the ride is a fun and entertaining one.
87;The chemistry between the entire cast is fantastic.
88;Smith may be the star but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co. stars.
89;It's fun and breezy entertainment suitable for the entire family and will go down as one of my favorite romantic comedies of late.
90;A couple of redeeming things about this movie.
91;Will Smith is his naturally charming self, which he plays in every movie I've ever seen him in (exception for Ali).
92;The writers of the movie did come up with some clever dialogue / dating tips for those of us who are single.
93;The movie was enjoyable up until about a third of the way through.
94;Sara's friend is seduced in to a one.
95;stand by a real creep.
96;Great Hollywood victimization logic here.
97;Will Smith certainly picked the right story for his first Romantic Comedy role!!
98;Kevin James is a hoot!!
99;Great story by Kevin Bisch!!
100;A funny, contemporary love story!!
101;Enjoy it with your honey.
102;I looked at the cover and was not so impressed, but hey, it was Will Smith, so it would be worth a few laughs.
103;We just got done watching this movie and I laughed more than I have laughed at a movie in a while!
104;"Does it cross into the ""cute"" realm a couple of times?"
105;It is not perfect, but it is a very good movie.
106;will Smith does an awesome job in the character.
107;player, but he pulls it off perfectly.
108;Kevin James is priceless and almost steals the show from Will Smith!
109;He is the ultimate underdog that you can't help but to cheer for!
110;An excellent Valentine's Day movie or gift!
111;Will Smith is fantastic as Alex Hitchens a nerd turned matchmaker.
112;The Date Doctor as Will's character is known helps super.
113;The beautiful and funny Eva Mendes plays gossip columnist Sara Melas, the object of Alex's attention and love.
114;But it is definitely entertaining along the way.
115;The world oldest subject LOVE is what drives the comedy and the touching moments in the movie.
116;kudos to Will Smith's wardrobe consultant (Marlene Stewart) she does an excellent job.
117;A must see movie and definitely worth 5 stars.
118;And I almost forgot Kevin James (The King of Queens) does the funniest dancing I have ever seen.
119;My wife and I were in tears laughing and I bet you will be also.
120;I am totally entertained by Will Smith and this film.
121;This film was totally entertaining to me.
122;I love Will Smith and think he did a great job.
123;This film was totally entertaining to me.
124;I love Will Smith and think he did a great job.
125;Will Smith and Kevin James are a HILLARIOUS combo in this film!
126;Although each one is a stand alone comic, in this film, they compliment and enhance each other's funniness to the max!
127;This will be a classic in years to come.
128;You gotta live Will and Kevin!
129;Will Smith is suave and sexy.
130;of course he can do a romantic comedy.
131;He helps otherwise helpless guys find true love in only three dates.
132;the movie centers around Hitch and one of his clients named Albert (played by the hilarious Kevin James).
133;Hitch thinks this is crazy, but agrees to help, knowing how passionate Albert is about her.
134;it's a romantic comedy, so it's fairly predictable.
135;Will Smith is wonderful, come on, you knew he would be.
136;"Kevin James is so funny
137;This is such a fun movie, a great date movie.
138;wow, I'd even say a perfect date movie.
139;The first 3/4 of the movie is feel good and funny with a small hiccup at the end.
140;I expected a good movie.
141;What I got was an even better movie.
142;The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible.
143;Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!The movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly.
144;Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm"
145;well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.
146;what I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable.
147;"The ""date doctor"" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top."
148;the funny parts are hilarious.
149;and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.
150;i totally recommend this movie.
151;This movie is gut wrenching funny at times .
152;Will Smith does a great job .
153;Hitch is a wonderful romantic comedy focusing in on two relationships in the show.
154;Will Smith is at his best in this movie, and works along with a spectacular cast.
155;Hitch is a perfect comedy movie.
156;thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.
157;He's funny, versatile, charismatic, great comedian what else to say gotta meet that word limit.
158;Kevin James was hilarious dancing.
159;He was very happy with it and watched it the very day it arrived.
160;Hitch is a feel good movie that'd be a safe bet to watch on a first date.
161;With its gently rolling presence, slapstick humor and decent acting, it'll tickle you without going into crudeness.
162;Will Smith does a great job of seeming like a normal guy instead of just another arrogant hollywood nutjob.
163;And Eva Mendez is a real cutie.
164;This movie will keep your attention from start to finish.
165;Because all of Kevin James' scenes are great and funny, while Will Smith's scenes are very boring.
166;Smith and James play their parts almost perfectly, but I guess James just got better lines.
167;When James is in the dancing scene, it's hilarious.
168;When Smith is teaching James how to kiss, it's hilarious.
169;Hitch was great and the pairing of Kevin James and Will Smith was surprisingly good.
170;I think Kevin James steals the show with his dance scene and overall hilarious acting, but Will Smith does make it funny as well.
171;"I never stopped laughing, which was the most important part, so it was well worth the time devoted to a pretty good ""chick flick""."
172;Another fine Will Smith movie, that has some real dull spots with nothing but talk.
173;kevin James sometimes would disappear for long periods of time and he was the comedic presence in this movie.
174;(I see an opportunity for a new professional industry.)
175;I found myself laughing outloud in the theater at several times and left the theater really happy and upbeat.
176;there are definitely some silly scenes, scenes that aren't realistic, and some scenes that are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes.
177;wishing a society good truly be accepting, open, good.
178;willed, and open to love.
179;while the ending is a little bit of an after school special (the message that 'Hitch' did nothing) it stays with the comedy and style of the movie without being corny.
180;one of the best movies I have scene since 50 First Dates.
181;I can safely say it was worth seeing, through the entire film there was consistent laughter despite the cliche pattern it followed (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back).
182;Eva Mendes was excellent in her role injecting the appropriate amount of humor and snootiness.
183;Kevin James is always hilarious but when paired up with the equally hilarious Will Smith, well that's just cinematic magic.
184;He exudes such personality that its hard to not like him.
185;As for Kevin James, he's just funny as heck, he reminds me of a little tamer version of Chris Farley.
186;The women in this film hold their ground surprisingly well, Eva Mendes is pretty funny and Amber Valetta shows real potential.
187;Then after Eva prints the article about Will, that was a bit slow as well, but each scene bounced back nicely.
188;So when all is said and done if you can handle some pretty cliche movie moments, this movie is well worth seeing.
189;this is a great romantic comedy that should be watched and considered in its own light.
190;Smith does a great job and the storyline is believable.
191;The movie brings out emotions, which is a sign of a good movie.
192;The premise, itself, is a good premise, being more uplifting, and leads to a feel good sense at the end of the movie.
193;It is also refreshing to see a movie where it is the woman that messed things up, rather than the man, even though it was the man that had to go to her in the end.
194;A fun loving, feel good romantic comedy that I would definitely recommend.
195;This film is absoutly wonderful!
196;HITCH is great becuase it is geniually funny.
197;The cast is very entertaing and funny.
198;"whatever I don
199;The romance was great and the laughs were constant.
200;As with most of Will Smiths movies this one is part of my collection.
201;I highly recommend if you like or need to laugh.
202;Its funny, sweet, and makes everyone smile.
203;also the fact that it arrived in 3 days made it so much better.
204;Will Smith has made a great comical come.
205;talking fellow who knows his business and performs it well.
206;smith is the star of this movie, and he fits the part very well.
207;I felt they all played their respective roles quite nicely, although I did find Eva Mendes character a little annoying after a while.
208;On the other hand, Mendes is the one person who provides some suspense.
209;She is a gossip columnist and the love interest of Will Smith.
210;You don't really know what she is going to do from one scene to the next, and this makes her character a little more entertaining.
211;what I like best about Hitch is that it gets you thinking about certain issues about dating, attraction, and ethics.
212;There is some truth to this.
213;But overall, """"Hitch"""" still ranks as a good, entertaining motion picture."""
214;The performances and the messages it sends about dating make it worth a look.
215;His movie is fun and funny.
216;Will can do everything went to date the women.
217;maybe its the fact that a good movie in my mind has a least one gun fight.
218;hitch is completely opposite of what i like in a movie but i still enjoyed it.
219;I have to say I have always enjoyed Will Smith, but this is one of his best roles.
220;A special romantic comedy that most couples will love.
221;I think even kids will probably find parts of this amusing.
222;His co. star Eva Mendes is not only beautiful, but does a wonderful performance as his romantic interest that very much has a mind of her own.
223;Support roles by Kevin James and others are outstanding and make this an above par look at the rigors of dating.
224;"If you enjoy the romantic movies without the fluff like ""50 First Dates"", you should like this one."
225;This movie will make you laugh and cry.
226;It genuinely touches the heart and funny bone.
227;Great acting, script, locations, camera work, and music make this a keeper.
228;Hitch is a terrific movie that is acceptable for my teenagers to watch.
229;Since generally Will Smith is charming, versatile, and generally deserving of his celebrity status, this movie is never intolerable and is enjoyable enough the first time around.
230;slick master of the same scene.
231;it was adorable and funny.
232;and like the title states, it really is a chick flick for men!
233;Will Smith is one of my favorite Hollywood characters.
234;Oh my goodness, this was a fun show!
235;One of the most enjoyable, cleanest, good.
236;Will is a natural in the romantic comedy role, and I think we'll certainly be seeing him in more.
237;i would most certainly recommend being on a date when you watch this movie.
238;spouse, girl friend, boy friend, best friend, it doesn't matter.
239;It's just a fun, clean, pick.you.
240;up and make you feel good kind of comedy.
241;You'll laugh a ton and enjoy yourself immensely.
242;one of the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies.
243;a fantastic show all around Enjoy!
244;basically, I liked the movie.
245;Instead of mining that comedic vein and making it work, the writers thought they could add two other story lines in there.
246;Anyway, I didn't laugh out loud too much, but the idea was a good one.
247;He showed himself to be capable of sophisticated comedy and physical comedy in this movie.
248;Hollywood needs to write him a movie that allows him to really showcase those talents.
249;This movie was alright I expected more little bit, this is more of a chick flick, there some funny parts in this film which I laughed alot.Yes this is probably one of Will Smith's best performances but not his best movie.
250;I really suprised to see such a wonderful performance from Will Smith.
251;It is a very good comedy.
252;He helps them to achieve their objective.
253;They start to work together and somehow miracle happens.
254;It is a comedy that you can watch it many times and laugh again and again.
255;Bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because I generally enjoy Will Smith's movies.
256;All the funny scenes are in the preview, but this movies still has some cuteness that saves it.
257;It's witty, entertaining and refreshing.
258;THE best Will Smith movie I have seen yet.
259;I really only saw 3 movies that were made in 2005 and all 3 were very good I thought.
260;I liked this movie because Will Smith did a very good job against.
261;he goes to talk to a guy Kevin James who wants a women who is a smart heiress that is a tributary for the company that he works for.
262;He is a really big dork and Will gets him hooked up.
263;He has so much charisma that it would seem that he would have done about 10 of these type of movies by now.
264;He has helped many men, and then comes Albert (Kevin James).
265;will Smith does a great job as this character.
266;screen charisma makes him the perfect choice for this character.
267;The person that steals this movie from him is Kevin James.
268;Most of the movie's big laughs came from his antics.
269;this movie would be definately worth the watch, especially if you have a significant other to view it with.
270;It is funny and romantic, but I wouldn't say that its a chick flick.
271;So there you go guys, this one is okay to watch.
272;:) Will Smith plays a guy who consults people on their dating habits and who best fits what they are looking for!!
273;The two hook up and snare this lovely lady and the rest is history.
274;Great Lovable Family Movie about love, life and the ups and downs between men and women.
275;I've seen this move 50 times and I'll see it 50 more.
276;This movie was an instant classic.
277;There was lots of funny scenes in the movie and there was also some good scenes in the movie.
278;First off, the part of Will Smith as Alex Hitchens was a great acting part and a great casting pick.
279;This is a Will Smith movie that I like with no aliens.
280;Another great actor that was in the movie was Kevin James (King of Queens).
281;He played an amazing part as Albert Brennaman.
282;He was funny and showed a lot of spirit into this acting part.
283;I never watch his TV Show, but I liked his acting part and thought he was funny.
284;Another great actress in the movie was Eva Mendes as Sara Melas.
285;She played a great part again in a comedy.
286;That is all I have to say about this movie.
287;"It really has become noticable to professionals in the film industry and his legion of fans across the world, that Will Smith, since his role in ""Six degrees of Separation"", (1993) in the role of Paul, a brilliant performance, and Independence Day (1996) as Captain Steven Hiller, this energized and gifted actor cannot set a foot wrong."
288;"Smith's latest release in the adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, ""I am Legend"", is absolutely extraordinary."
289;"However, ""Hitch"" (2005), reveals Smith's versatility as a comedic and dramatic actor."
290;"Hitch is a light a breezy romantic comedy about an anonymous ""date doctor"" who teaches nerds to get the women they desire."
291;in terms of plot, this is a typical boy meets girl film with a joyful ending, but what makes it is Will Smith and Kevin James, a great and unexpected brilliant comedy team.
292;i saw this movie before in theaters and it was very good.
293;will smith was very hilarious in this movie and i hope he makes another one like this.
294;In Hitch, Will Smith proves he has what it takes to be a great romantic.
295;comedy lead: he's attractive, engaging and very charismatic.
296;This movie is sweet without being maudlin, and much funnier than the average romantic comedy.
297;Eva Mendes makes a great partner for Smith and Kevin James' infatuation/relationship with Amber Valetta is hilarious.
298;Hitch is a perfect date movie.
299;He is very successful until one day he meets someone that he is interested in for the longer.
300;there are painful moments, there are hysterical moments, and in the end, it is a very good movie to watch and own.
301;Hitch is a romantic comedy that has many enjoyable moments, some good laughs, and stops just short of being a chick flick.
302;Will Smith has a wonderful screen presence as Hitch (Alex Hitchens) who has a private consulting practice of helping feckless men pull things together enough to get a shot at the woman of their dreams.
303;kevin James is terrific as Albert, one of Hitch's biggest challenges.
304;played with humanity and worldly knowing by Amber Valleta.
305;sara, played with energy and charm by Eva Mendes, who is a gossip columnist after stories about Allegra Cole.
306;She notices this ordinary guy with Allegra and wonders what is up.
307;i will let you discover for yourself the rest of the hijinks that ensue.
308;the ending is weaker than the middle acts, but this is a romantic comedy so who really cares.
309;Just enjoy the show with someone you care about.
310;What it is is a great romantic comedy with impecabble timing despite its typical premise.
311;with something of a twist.
312;It's the moments between Will Smith and his fellow actors that make this a real joy to watch.
313;Will has such a personna and way of making the comedy work with his mannerisms you can't help but laugh.
314;He turns ordinary dialogue into great comedy.
315;It is one of those movies I will watch over and over again.
316;I recommend it to anyone that wants to see a feel good movie.
317;It picks up my spirits every time I watch it.
318;First off, this movie is just great.
319;My wife and I watched this for the second time last night (first was in the theater) and we had forgotten how great this movie really was.
320;The chemestry between all the charactors is perfect.
321;He just has a way of making you laugh at EVERYTHING.
322;The great thing about this movie is that no matter who your watching your going to be laughing.
323;The movie as a whole is just really entertaining and very well put together.
324;Will Smith is always a good actor, very funny and he has that charm that makes you watch him.
325;Watch this movie with that special someone, it's the perfect date movie and is a movie you can recommend to pretty much EVERYONE.
326;Hitch is a movie that hooks the viewer right from the start.
327;The plot is original and fun.
328;Will Smith plays his character, Alex Hitchens, brilliantly!
329;"I found myself actually rotting for ""Hitch"", otherwise known as ""The Date Doctor"", to help his clients attract the attention, and hopefully love, from their favorite members of the opposite sex."
330;smith has once again proven his ability as a star on the big screen.
331;I judge all movies by how well the film grabs me, taking me on a ride that I forget it isn't real life I'm seeing.
332;Hitch has such great chemistry between the actors and actresses that I actually forgot I was watching a movie and just sat back and enjoyed the interaction between characters.
333;The director did a good job cutting out some of the scenes originally included in the filming.
334;when Will Smith and Kevin James are on screen together, they are hilarious.
335;Now throw in the amazing Eva Mendez and this turns into a film that just can't miss.
336;I think the entire cast did very well including Mendez.
337;If you haven't seen it, you must see it!
338;a Will Smith star vehicle at best.
339;smooth grin, daring your expectations to be anything above waist.
340;Will Smith as the Date Doctor, selling his charm to nobodies.
341;The writing abounds with cleverness and laugh.
342;Finally, Smith gets a role where his mastery of gesture matches smart dialog line for line.
343;And true to Hitch's belief in non.
344;verbal communication, the movie boasts some great physical comedy.
345;Dare yourself to give this movie a chance.
346;It's hilarious and true, the best Hollywood surprise to come along in years.
347;All the performances are very good, particularly Kevin James, who comes across as more real than anyone else in this flick.
348;It's a good story and the pacing is lively.
349;A great movie for watching at home!
350;Add together the number of 1960's R&B tunes (double the points if tunes are used in a wacky lip.
351;"Mulitply the number of songs by the number of ""gay comic relief"" characters in the movie."
352;If you score above 10 points with this formuala.
353;"i had a great time watching ""Die Hard"" last night."
354;Every role is perfectly cast in this romantic comedy/buddy movie.
355;Kevin James and Will Smith are funny, but never over.
356;top in roles that could have gone silly with less capable actors.
357;the movie is also a love affair with Manhattan.
358;by the way, the soundtrack for Hitch is great, too.
359;This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again .
360;it's very funny and entertaining.
361;Will Smith is so absolutely expressive in everything he does, and of course Eva is BREATHTAKINGLY beautiful as well as a fantastic actress.
362;I've seen this three times now and the third time was JUST as funny as the first two.
363;I loved this and I didn't think I would but my partner recommended it.
364;I'm so glad I agreed to see it because I couldn't stop laughing and Will Smith is brilliant as Hitch.
365;He should do more romantic comedies as he is a natural!
366;He proves once again that he can take any role and make a great movie out of it.
367;I never really saw him as the romantic comedy type but it works for him.
368;Hancock was definately no masterpiece but it was definately funny.
369;We need more good romantic comedies with black people.
370;LOL, Hitch is a very funny movie that anyone should be able to enjoy.
371;why this is a great film.
372;For starters Will Smith and Kevin James III have a great rapport, and their scenes sizzle.
373;I can imagine that they improvised a lot of their scenes.
374;Will Smith and Eva Mendes look like they are in love, and both produce great performances.
375;Anytime I feel low I put this on, and it always produces a smile, and a lot of laughs.
376;Will Smith is an awesome actor.
377;He does a very nice job of portrayin the kind of guy that is needed for that role.
378;Lots or comedy and romance.
379;Very comical, heart warming, easy to watch.
380;I loved how will smith taught people with no self confidence to find love with beautiful woman!!
381;First of all: Will Smith is WONDERFUL in this movie.
382;"I felt that his character was a noble man in that he liked women and made it his life work to help other men (not guys) who also liked women become confident in their pursuit of their ""Heart's Desire""However the Love interest of this movie is an unforgivable bitch."
383;Watching Will Smith apologize to this person makes the ending that much more heinous.
384;so let's see, 5 stars for will Smith and his clients, a serious Turkey for the love interest.
385;My wife picked this movie and I reluctantly watched it.
386;I was on the fence, but in the end I decided that it did merit a couple of comments.
387;Set in New York, I would discribe the movie as fun, sweet, cute and innocent.
388;Watch it with someone you love for the feelings it will invoke in you.
389;The movie will leave you with a smile on your face and joy in your heart.
390;Smith continues to prove that her really is a big screen actor.
391;He is charming, relaxed and easygoing in that real.
392;There is a genuinely sweet sincerity in this film, that really makes it work.
393;Eva Mendes is lovely and more serious than most of the girls chased in these films, Amber Valleta proves that she can actually deliver dialogue without being laughed at and James is the comically sweet loser/everyman.
394;I have always liked Will Smith and Kevin James.
395;put the two together and you get a classic.
396;It was funny, cute and charming.
397;My husband even liked it!
398;So it is a chick flick for all!
399;I hope Will Smith does more romantic comedies.
400;The female leads were great too.
401;worked fine and was a great gift for my mom, she loves this movie so had to get it for her.
402;Yes, that is what I called this movie .
403;why did this idiot give the movie 4 stars?The 'Bargain Bin movie', for a change, is a good thing.
404;A good deal for a good movie.
405;As a guy who likes 'guy movies', it takes a lot for me to say this.
406;'Hitch' is a chick flick that I enjoyed.
407;It is not the greatest movie, but it is definitely funny, 'cute' and a good 'chick flick'.
408;Very pleased with how fast this was shipped.
409;It was cheap, and perfect!
410;I have seen it now 4 times with various people, and enjoyed it each time.
411;What I will do is tell you Will Smith is just amazing as a Date Doctor , and if the women and men in the audience listen to him, they will get some insights into what the other side wants.
412;seriously, the movie is full of fun insights about the opposite sex, which really made the film fun and appealing to me.
413;it's a wonderful romantic comedy.
414;I really loved the soundtrack selection, as well as the original sound recordings for this movie.
415;He plays every part he's in perfectly, and I wish we could see more of him.
416;And of couse, Kevin James steals every scene he is in.
417;He really is a great physical comedian.
418;Commentary is great, and enjoyable.
419;I liked learning about the decisions about soundtrack, especially since I enjoyed it so much.
420;great twin storylines between Hitch and the Kevin James character.
421;I liked the dance scene at the end, at their wedding.
422;I really liked this movie!
423;I was surprised to find that I liked 95% of this movie.
424;What you get is a good structured film with some very funny moments.
425;The scene when Albert gets back to his office after quitting his job is extremely funny.
426;i would still recommend the movie as there are some very funny moments.
427;This was a great romantic comedy that I greatly enjoyed.
428;"Will Smith is perfect for the role of Alex Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" who can help men have a successful date."
429;It is a lot of fun to witness their love story develop, as is the love story between Sara (played by Eve Mendes) and Alex. there was one part of the movie that I was confused about, however.
430;The movie is also about how a pretty average guy and a society glamor girl can live happily ever after together.
431;I found this to be an excellent movie, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good summer flick.
432;Th comedy is seriously funny here and i waited a few years to replace my VH S version, but worth the cost to keep it in my library
433;This movie was very cute.
434;If you like romantic comedies, this is the one to see.
435;"I liked this much better than, for example, ""Monster In Law"" which had two big names in it in the form of Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda."
436;anyway, Will Smith does an excellent job as Hitch, a man dedicated to helping good but clueless men get the woman of their dreams.
437;will definitely takes this role as his own while Eva Mendes does keep up with him quite nicely as her character has issues of her own that she deals with during the film.
438;Its almost suitable for families to watch.
439;Make no mistake though, it is hilarious!
440;While February is often not a great month for blockbusters, it is the season for the romantic comedy, what with Valentine's Day and all.
441;And every once in a while, the ever elusive GOOD romantic comedy shows up, with the right level of sweetness, humor, and drama to make good movie entertainment.
442;He teaches the Regular Joe how to be suave, cool, and get the attention of a desired female.
443;heels for the beautiful celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).
444;Your actions and body language can say more about you than anything you can.
445;So guys, take some notes at this one.
446;"But ""Hitch"" works at two hours because its story is complex enough, and the characters are endearing enough, to last that long on screen without seeming like a drag."
447;It's nice to see a so. called romantic comedy devoid of bathroom humor for once, but the whole warm.
448;It's got some nice platitudes, and an overall sweet theme, but all that sugar might be a little unhealthy.
449;"First off I have to admit that the big reason I went to see this film was because Of ""KING OF QUEENS"" Kevin James, but it also helped that the very talented Will Smith is in this to."
450;Director Andy Tennant did an excellent job with this film.
451;Various types of humor are incorperated into the film as well as the romantic factor for all you date movie people.
452;we will start with the star Will Smith, I for one think it is great to see him in something else other then a big budget sci.
453;And he did a excellent job in his first role in this type of film, his preformance is amazing.
454;His charisma and screen precence make his character very belivable.
455;What can one say about this brilliant preformance.
456;Kevin's preformance is so good, so brilliant, so belivable it is nothing short of a classic preformance.
457;His nice guy shy role fits him perfectlly, so much so that when he isn't on screen you are left waiting and wanting more of Mr James.
458;Most of the films best moments happen because of him, the ending is a perfect example, or his early dance scene with Will.
459;which brings me to the on screen chemestry of these two brilliant preformers.
460;When both are on screen you will laugh with out a doubt.
461;"The chemestry between the two is amazing, no team I can remember has done so well together since Samual and John on ""PULP FICTION""."
462;Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)This is a good review.
463;I received in the time promised in good condition and very good packaging.
464;Really good comedy love story about a love stunted man and woman and the people who show them the way back.
465;But it is very good entertainment.
466;the three lead actors do an incredible job of portraying in a comical way what most of us go through and would do to meet the person of our dreams to spend our life with.
467;He steals this film in every scene he's in.
468;man to Kevin James' Albert, and the chemistry works.
469;With his coaching he believes he can help any man land his perfect soul mate.
470;With Alex's help Albert is able to get up the nerve to ask Allegra Cole out, and the rest is comical genius.
471;Kevin James dance instruction sequence alone is more than worth the price of admission.
472;He did a terrific a job.
473;And Pursuit of Happyness just keeps you wanting more Will Smith.
474;It's a romantic comedy with class.
475;You may even increase your chances with the lady you want if you watch closely.
476;I do not care what other reviewers said about this movie, but in my opnion Mr. Smith and James do a great job in entertaining us.
477;"like the recent summer flick ""Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle,"" this is one of those few gems capable of helping us take ourselves a little less seriously, laugh at how silly we are and lighten up about the big things: life, love, desire."
478;a romantic comedy is the last sort of movie you want to burden with ambitious expectations.
479;"Will Smith's alluring confidence is on display here, trading in the malodramatic and brooding pomposity of ""I, Robot"" for a far friendlier and memorable role as a ""love Doctor"" capable of turning any man's wildest dreams into reality."
480;James is the big surprise of the film, but Smith carries himself just as well.
481;i was surprised at just how consistently entertaining this film was without giving in to the temptations that most films like this can't resist.
482;Hitch makes for a fantastic date movie and might even give some cynics like myself a glimpse of the bright side.
483;My feelings are good not great on this one.
484;The speedating scene is amusing as well.
485;And they really charged alot to see this in the theater???
486;Hitch is one of those movies youll watch once.
487;On the side of this Kevin James's character meets this famous and rich person and needs help getting her to notice him, so he calls up Hitch.
488;recommended for the entire family.
489;Will Smith, although has done a little bit of Romantic Comedy in other movies, this is the first full length movie he has done in that genre and does a fine job.
490;Playing a successful date doctor but has a little trouble himself when he meets Sara (played by the beautiful Eva Mendes), the scene when he kicks her in the face when on the ocean is hilarious.
491;A lot of great scenes done by both Will Smith and Kevin James.
492;The kissing scene was amazingly funny.
493;This movie almost falls into that trap a few times but it does have a great appeal with such a powerful cast, and a lot of great comedians pushing the movie on.
494;Not the best movie of all time but definitely a great start to the comedy movies of 2005.
495;I wanted to watch something light and fun.
496;Will Smith is fantastic, but Kevin James (Albert) steals the show.
497;It appeals to both sexes.
498;My brother and his guy friend loved it too.
499;I'm giving it five stars because it did the job of making me laugh, making my heart melt just a little bit, and all without being cheezy or corny.
500;Perfect story for Will Smith's first romantic comedy!!
501;The character played by Kevin James was hilarious, and very cute, at first.
502;He did a great job really!
503;The movie really is highly recommended because you'll find yourself easily smiling throughout the whole of it.
504;it's a perfect movie to watch on a date!!
505;when Will Smith gets together with Eva Mendes is especially touching.
506;if you're looking for something romantic funny and sweet don't miss this one!
507;I would love to see Kevin James starring in more movies solo.
508;They are starting to use Kevin James as an supporting actor right now.
509;Hitch is a fairly good movie.
510;I'm sure you all know the plot from other reviews, so I'll spare you.
511;"this is one of those movies you go to when you're in the mood to see something ""cute""."
512;"A few scenes will have you giggling, and others will make you go ""Awww""."
513;Hitch is the best romantic comedy yet!
514;He is great in action movies and even better in a romantic role.
515;Will Smith and Eva Mendes were smokin' hot in this movie and had great chemistry.
516;Eva Mendes is a hard headed, successful, and independent woman who hasn't experienced love in a long time.
517;There were many ups and downs to the movie but SO many laughs.
518;this movie is a must see with your significant other.
519;Even men will get a kick out of this romantic comedy.
520;This movie was great and had some great messages to send BUT the ending was horrible.
521;Its an allright movie to add to your romantic comedy collection.
522;It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through.
523;I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you.
524;"and that is, precisely what it happens in this clever comedy about the role of hitch
525;Hitch's mission is to support and essential information about the women's psychology, what they really want, wish and expect, the use of the body language, the importance of a look, and the adequate employment of a phrase in the right moment.
526;funny, original and smart entertaining film that links with that Trufautt ' s lovely film """"The man who loved women"""" and showing that the author cinema is coming back, fortunately in USA, because the creative process has been growing in the last decade, at short steps, if you want but that means something."""
527;I love hitch it the best cute sweet movie ever.
528;This movie was brilliant and funny.
529;Kevin James as Albert Brennamen and Will Smith as Alex Hitchins, were great together.
530;All the sequences are memorable .
531;You will laugh, and there is a great story to be learned.
532;It's one of my favorites of all time.
533;Invite your special one over for a night order out Pizza and a nice wine pop this one into your player and have a great night.
534;"memorable romantic comedies in the recent past, I find ""Hitch"" to be somewhat refreshing."

536;going humor but also maturity, something that isn't seen too often in his other works.
537;James' performance is entertaining in his unabashed goofiness.
538;But otherwise, this is good bang for your buck if you want something light.
539;Very good : it is hard to find (VHS) movies.
540;What you are about to see in no way resembles real life.
541;There is no way a beautiful and famous movie star would hook up with an unemployed accountant the way they did in the movie.
542;but I do have a bone to pick with the humor of this movie.
543;All that was left was the kind of funny parts.
544;I've always loved Will Smith.
545;"He has a charisma that carries naturally on the screen and I look forward to every movie he is in (okay, I haven't caught ""Ali"" yet)."
546;For a first venture into a romantic comedy I think he did well with the script provided him.
547;"I haven't watched his show ""King of Queens"" and I don't know of any movie he has done, but I really hope to see more of Kevin James."
548;He did his role well and I couldn't think of anybody else that could have played that part better.
549;Kevin James nailed his character perfectly.
550;I see a great star rising.
551;Well, anybody who likes a decent romantic comedy or even a regular comedy should watch it once.
552;His newest client Albert, Kevin James, a clumbsy lawyer is in love with a beautiful, rich, famous woman named Allegra.
553;Kevin James is so funny, and he and Will Smith have excellent chemistry on screen together.
554;Eva Mendes also does a great job as Will Smith's love interest.
555;I love anything with Will Smith and this one didnt dissappoint me.
556;But I slipped this one through on Will Smith's merits and it was a joy to watch.
557;He's a real professional, his methods are a great success but of course he doesn't have a girl.
558;"When he finally sets his heart on someone, he takes her on the most amazing day out in New York, it had me swooning ""oh I wish for that kind of romance"" (I really am pathetic!)"
559;It's a complete disaster, especially when she finds out his profession, but leads on to a very satisfying conclusion.
560;i loved this movie and highly recommend it!
561;"In this comedy, Hitch, the ""date doctor"", helps discouraged single men connect with women."
562;he hangs around and monitors their performance.
563;"the ""date doctor' succeeds with even seemingly."
564;"She reacts with contempt when she learns of the very existence of a ""date doctor"", and then is furious with Hitch when she learns that he is in fact the one."
565;At the end of the movie, Hitch makes a statement that is very ironic in view of what he had been saying all along about men, dating, and women.
566;Will Smith in his comedic best.
567;ray this is a steal
568;hitch is a great movie with a great storyline.
569;if you love will smith you will love this movie!
570;Anything Will Smith does it great, and this movie is no exception.
571;I don't think I have seen a Will Smith movie I have not liked, he is a very talented actor and does well in any type of roll.
572;I would recommend this to anyone.
573;If Kevin James was in more parts, this movie could be funnier and more entertaining.
574;and that's what this film does with the romantic comedy subgenre.
575;night stands) while he can't make it work for himself is outright hilarious, such as when he shows Eva Mendes where her great.
576;It's on a par with pretty much anything that John Cusack's put out on the same subject.
577;thank you very much Amazing AmazonPERFECT CONDITION, SAME PICTURE TOO.
578;thank you very much Amazing Amazon
579;Will Smith was born destined to play this role, he expands his great horizon of rap, hip.
580;hop, action and comedy movies into the romantic category.
581;this hilarious, passionate and educational romance story is one for the ages.
582;Will Smith stars in this funny film about dating and falling in love.
583;He helps men find dates.
584;He has been rather successful at his work, as evidenced by the pictures of couples he helped get together hanging on his wall.
585;This is the beginning of a friendship between Hitch and Albert.
586;Soon, Albert is going to fancy art galleries and New York Knicks games with Allegra.
587;Meanwhile, Hitch has found a woman that he likes.
588;She works as a newspaper gossip columnist.
589;What will happen with Sara and Hitch and Allegra and Albert?This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while.
590;Will Smith was the perfect choice for the role of Hitch.
591;His funny disposition really makes the character shine.
592;Kevin James does an equally outstanding job as the bumbling but lovable Albert.
593;Eva Mendes and Amber Valletta are also very good as Sara and Allegra.
594;i recommend this movie very highly.
595;I'm a fan of Will Smith's music and movies, and he delivers perhaps his finest performance in this movie.
596;"This is the perfect ""date"" movie, so if you're looking for something fun to do on date night, put this movie in, relax, and see a really great romantic comedy."
597;"The casting was a stroke of genius with the smooth and charming Will Smith as a much sought after ""date doctor"" who can make love bloom for everyone but himself, the strong but sultry Eva Mendez as a gossip columnist who uncovers his idenity and threatens to break his heart, and the always funny Kevin James as a nerdy accountant chasing his dream girl."
598;This film is funny all the way through, warm hearted, romantic and smart.
599;Will Smith did a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that the viewers were expecting.
600;He was definatly right for the part and had the feel for the character.
601;I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith.
602;Kevin James makes an impressive first outing with movies, he is hilarious in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is.
603;Andy Tennant, Director, did a good job but.
604;There are definitely some silly scenes, which some aren't quite realistic, but the other are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes.
605;the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies.
606;Hitch is great for (almost) all ages (due to little language) but it is worth having.
607;Very funny and worth the time to watch!
608;Enjoyed the lightheartedness and charisma of the plot.
609;A must see for someone who's looking for something to laugh and have fun with.
610;Now I can watch it on the go on my iPad
611;It has comedy and alot of heart!
612;One of my favorite Will Smith movies.
613;My daughter will be pleased when she gets it for Christmas.
614;Just one of the fun, feel.
615;This was certainly a chick flick, but as far as chick flick's go this is the best one I have ever seen.
616;The film is broke into three parts, when will smiths character is on the screen with his love interest, when kevin james character is on the screen with his love interest, and when kevin james and will smith are together (will smith teaching kevin james how to get and keep his love interest).
617;But overall this is a good movie, and will keep you entertained the majority of the time.
618;Hitch is about a love doctor (Will Smith) who helps geeks get the girl.
619;He's smooth and cool and Smith plays him well.
620;He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women.
621;So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool.
622;Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most.
623;James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen.
624;He's great in the King of Queens but also shows here that he could have a bright movie career.
625;Him teaming up with the Rock could make a pretty entertaining movie.
626;Hitch is a great pick.
627;me up, laugh out loud movie that appeals to both men and women.
628;Will Smith is just perfect and Kevin James, his lovesick client, is hilarious.
629;It's no easy task to get my husband to sit through a romantic comedy, but this one is great.
630;a buddy movie with romance maybe?
631;g2g for all you Will smith fans.
632;p. s Will Smith's best movie was I,Robot
633;This film had its very funny moments, even though it was dumbed down to about seventh grade humor.
634;Will Smith is a pretty good actor and it's fun to watch what his character will do next.
635;Kind of a formula picture, but it's good and fairly innocent fun.
636;Kevin James is really a very funny man and while this is a Romantic Comedy, this film is just funny.
637;I have a rule, if it comes on TV, I watch it.
638;It is just plain fun.
639;did I mention, it is just a great time at the movies?
640;When it comes to his own happiness, Hitch takes the road less traveled, one filled with hilarious potholes and the occasional speed bump.
641;Even when dark clouds of contrived plot complications arrive in the third act, Smith still shines.
642;hitch exudes confidence as he guides New York's lonely hearts into each other's arms, taking on his biggest challenge in good natured slob Albert Brennaman (Kevin James).
643;He is smitten with beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), who only sees Albert as one of her corporate accountants.
644;Watching Smith and James (The King of Queens) go through the motions is a hoot, especially when it comes to the more delicate matters of the heart.
645;writer Kevin Bisch finds plenty of humor in the premise, and even though he uses shorthand to get the ball rolling, never shortchanges the characters or their motives.
646;when Hitch isn't being silly it's actually quite smart.
647;He's slick and effective, something Hitch lacks when the tables are turned.
648;james is equally effective and sincere, making us believe not only can someone like Albert win the heart of someone like Allegra, he deserves to.
649;Likewise, Amber Valletta equalizes the rich bitch socialite role with a sympathetic nod, turning a caricature into flesh and blood person.
650;will Smith was good in this, He was right for the part, and He had the feel for the character.
651;I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith.
652;Kevin James makes a impressive first outing with movies, he is the most funny in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is.
653;I also felt that the Director was doing a good job but.
654;The writers needed to write something original, and instead of the cliches', they could've actually formed a decent romantic movie.
655;"Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the ""date doctor"" who helps men get to first base with the woman of their dreams."
656;will Smith is one of the most likeable personas around and he exudes his usual easy charm here.
657;Hitch is charming and witty with a woman but letting her inside is a bit too scary.
658;The training sessions with the two of them are probably the most enjoyable of the whole movie and certainly enjoyable.
659;this is an easy movie to watch and an easy movie to like.
660;Hitch is funny, entertaining, and has a good.
661;Will Smith is as good as expected, but Kevin James plays a critical role in providing warmth and vulnerability in a movie that could otherwise have come off as slick and cynical.
662;loved the chemistry between the stars, as well.
663;would recommend this to anyone.
664;I enjoyed this movie, but it went on for about a half.
665;"All the stuff at the beginning was good: the conceit of Will Smith being a ""dating consultant"" who has the secrets of letting ""any"" guy get ""any"" girl he wants."
666;What is good about the film are the performances from Will Smith and .
667;It was also cute how Will Smith, as the expert, looses his cool around the girl he likes.
668;Couples will get together, break up, and magically reunite.
669;This is one hilarious movie.
670;It is a very funny movie in which Kevin James does a great job.
671;Will Smith does a great job and has some very funny scenes too.
672;All in all this is a very good comedy that I would definately recommend.
673;Thought all the characters were great, and the production had the perfect balance of humor and tender romance.
674;This is a great movie, had to use it for an assignment for school.
675;It has a great story line with love thrown into the mix.
676;fi, thrillers, etc. (what you would basically expect from any guy), I can honestly say that I very rarely choose a romantic comedy, and never a musical.
677;Hitch is the story of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith), a man whose job is to find ways for a man to successfully woo the woman of his choice into a successful dating relationship.
678;Hitch is a man that is good at his job, but never really finds the time for his own dating life.
679;"those are your basic elements (give or take one or two) to almost every romantic comedy these days, and ""Hitch"" contains several of them."
680;"existent that you find yourself already knowing how the movie will end and checking your eyelids for holes within the first 30 minutes due to boredom, ""Hitch"" keeps things going at a very steady pace with plenty of laughs and clever dialogue that I never got distracted by getting ahead of the story, and remained entertained throughout."
681;Probably the element I enjoyed the most of the movie was the way the character of Hitch had taken a by.
682;the performances by the cast were uniformly strong, Will Smith and Kevin James out.
683;Eva Mendes was very endearing as the woman that Hitch is trying to start a relationship with, and she shows a great on.
684;screen chemistry with Will Smith that made their couple very believable.
685;The story as I said earlier contained many of the familiar elements of most romantic comedies, yet still entertained me, and I never felt like I'd seen it all before.
686;"with all of that being said, ""Hitch"" isn't the most original romantic comedy, but there are numerous elements that are unique, and allowed me to overlook the same old elements that are so tried and true to this genre."
687;It was a very entertaining movie, that provides you plenty of laughter and leaves you feeling good, which is what these movies should do.
688;A funny movie that is for both women and men.
689;Will Smith and Kevin James who is one of my favorite comedians are great in this movie.
690;Very funny and is a perfect date movie to take your girlfriend or wife which I did take my girlfriend, her cousin, and her cousins boyfriend to see.
691;She liked it, I liked it, her cousin liked it, and her cousin's boyfriend liked it.
692;Cool story line where the teacher ends up becoming the student and everybody gets the girl in the end.
693;"Will Smith is the ""Date Doctor"", a man who knows everything about coaching other people towards romance."
694;He knows all of the angles and he shares them with male clients who are in love and feel that the object of their affection is out of their reach.
695;His main client is a klutzy accountant, played by Kevin James, who is in love with a wealthy divorcee.
696;Meanwhile Smith is using all of his romantic ploys to win over a gossip columnist, played by Eva Mendes.
697;This movie is full of laughs and, although the end is predictable, getting there is lots of fun.
698;Alongside the 'cool' Liberal .
699;Found the movie light hearted and entertaining but with a message that is true in the real world.
700;Will Smith plays this role well and the movie has just the right amount of humour without making it too corny.
701;Romantics should enjoy this film.
702;Awesome movie about men and how women see them.
703;Will Smith has done it again.
704;It is amazing how this guy can pull off any role, even in a non.
705;Hitch is a funny and watchable movie.
706;"smith is a ""date doctor"" who helps people sort out their romantic problems and he has his formula pat down successfully."
707;In this case, Smith's succesful dating formula starts to unravel when his client's successful love life becomes the talk of the town.
708;eva Mendes and Kevin James did a fantastic job in their respective roles.
709;I really liked James in this movie, and his dance moves are a definite highlight of this movie.
710;it is a great film to catch on a girls night out.
711;"in the ""goofy guy gets the hot girl"" genreHowever the particular steps along the way are a lot of fun."
712;Lots of clever lines and very funny scenes.
713;Charming as ever, Will Smith carries this film through many pitfalls to come out shining like a new penny (as usual).
714;clean portrayal of a dating expert working to help men get to know women who would never give them a second glance intrigues and holds the viewer's interest through the entire film.
715;Eventually in the movie, he realizes that the best way to get women to like you is to simply be yourself.
716;whats nice and new about this movie is all the practical tips given on how to impress a women.
717;the movie is fine, with few funny scenes.
718;Its a romantic comedy filled with a cast of great actors and actresses who make this movie memorable which is why I gave it 5 stars.
719;The relationship dynamics between men and women are relatable and funny.
720;If you enjoy romance, comedy and the beauty of friendship, this movie is for you.
721;Cupid flutters around spreading happiness with his arrows of love and affection.
722;Love changes everything, as it means commitment, trust, and mutual affection when the love is answered.
723;Hitch (Will Smith) is the human cupid, as he works his magic as a partner consultant that helps men get noticed by the woman who is the target of their love.
724;He is a true gentleman that helps others find their opportunity with love by shooting his arrows of affection.
725;Carefully Hitch helps the men with how to approach the women, what to say, and how they must behave around the woman they love.
726;Everything is thoroughly planned, as it all comes down to one moment .
727;hitch is a warm comedy about love, affection, and the connection between people.
728;Will Smith is perfect for the role as Hitch, as he easily drifts into the gentle and cool character.
729;His performance is well balanced with the supporting cast, and Kevin James complements Will Smith by making the two look like contemporary Laurel and Hardy.
730;In the end, Hitch will offer an easy comedy with some great laughs, but also an interesting notion in regards about the opportunity of love.
731;I would just like to say this is a great clean commedy, with the exception of one curse word.
732;I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend that anyone looking for a great laugh, see it!
733;hop dance moves to Hitch.
734;There were some other scenes that were worth a chuckle or two.
735;Probably would make a good date movie for most couples.
736;I know my girlfriend liked it.
737;Will Smith is very enjoyable as the smooth talking dating coach in this light.
738;his overweight client the accountant Albert Brenneman (Kevin James from sitcom King Of Queens) is perfectly cast and highly entertaining.
739;fetched, is a great deal more tender and humorous than the budding relationship between Smith and Mendes.
740;there are some classic scenes and it is all amusing, although there is not a great deal of chemistry between Smith and Mendes, nothing like the sizzling air in How to Lose a guy in 10 days with Kate Hudson and Matthew McConnaghy.
741;if I could rate a little under 4 I would, but I can't, and it's better than 3, so girls, it's worth a look.
742;This is the first time I've ever seen Will Smith in the lead on a romantic comedy.
743;this movie will offer a lot of laugh out loud moments and the relationship between Hitch and Sara is very well done.
744;"up of the cast was indeed crucial to this story and it was fun to see ""the geek"" (played by Kevin James) really get the girl and how Hitch (Will Smith) had to work for it."
745;this really is a feel good movie and one that will entertain while at the same time not insult the viewer.
746;Will Smith delivers yet another AWESOME movie!!!
747;Had only seen one preview for the film and thought it looked decent, since I love many more of Will Smith movies didn't see any harm in giving this one a shot!
748;A Old time favorite for me, I am a Will Smith fan along with Eva Mendez, so happy to own this
749;This is another outstanding performance by Will Smith.
750;This is one that I will watch again and again!
751;A definite feel good movie!
752;I chose this movie because it was starring Will Smith.
753;I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised in watching this movie.
754;I liked Eva Mendes alot already.
755;It's a good movie overall that keeps you interested the whole way thru.
756;I recommend it to all Will Smith fans.
757;Eva Mendes was a pleasant surprise.
758;There are a couple reasons I took off one star here:1.
759;looking guys ending up with absolutely gorgeous women.
760;It is a fun romantic comedy which starts off very cleverly, and then devolves into a standard formula driven romantic comedy.
761;I enjoyed it, but had problems with numbers 1 and 2 above.
762;"The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a. k. a. the ""Date Doctor,"" and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten."
763;hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.
764;"Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first ""date,"" you have no trouble believing he is the ""Date Doctor."""
765;Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).
766;"But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e. g., ""shock and awe""), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics."
767;James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.
768;He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.
769;He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.
770;For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?
771;But I have rarely seen a film whose self.
772;Will Smith is a cute, funny, and charismatic actor who has charm to spare.
773;It is, therefore, surprising that Hollywood has never before cast him as the lead in a romantic comedy.
774;He takes on clients whom he then coaches in the mysteries of finding one's way into the heart of a beloved, but seemingly unattainable, woman.
775;It appears that he has fallen for the gorgeous Sara (Eva Mendes), a local gossip columnist.
776;"will Smith is simply terrific in the role of ""Hitch"", playing the role with insouciant charm."
777;His likeability quotient can't get much higher, and he certainly infuses the role with his effortless charm and humor.
778;As his love interest, Eva Mendes is certainly a gorgeous leading lady, although her character is not always likable.
779;Still, she makes the most of her role as the feisty Sara, and I look forward to seeing her in more films.
780;i totally enjoyed seeing Kevin James in the film.
781;He is the star of the long.
782;He is simply a big, cuddly, teddy bear sort of guy that you can't help but love, which helps make his on.
783;screen pairing with Amber Valleta believable.
784;They are simply adorable together.
785;Amber Valleta successfully infuses her character, Allegra Cole, with a certain vulnerability that makes her very likable.
786;kudos also go to director, Andy Tennant, whose deft direction contributes to the success of this film.
787;acted romantic comedy that is highly enjoyable.
788;Co. stars Will Smith and Kevin James have great chemistry in the film and are excellent foils for each other.
789;I enjoyed this film tremendously.
790;A light hearted love story with just the right amount of humor added.
791;Will Smith and his co. star are so funny in this film.
792;It'll keep you laughing and at the same time it might remind you of time when you where trying to get someone's attention of the opposite sex.
793;Hitch brings to the screen the story of a consultant who helps guys on their dates.
794;Things get a bit more complicated when he finds himself in need of help.
795;it is not very unique, nevertheless, it is quite pleasant.
796;Will Smith, Kevin James, and Eva Mendes give good performances.
797;I don't know what it is about these type of movies but I like them, this is a good movie.
798;If you need a good laugh at the end of a hard week, this is the film for you!
799;Hitch is a remarkable combination of humor and sensitivity, enjoyable for both men and women.
800;There is also good old slapstick and laughing at our own human foibles and weaknesses.
801;Thankfully the humor is clean, even though the movie has its share of sexual innuendo and God's name misused.
802;But I was really impressed by the emphasis on honorable, respectful behavior in Hitch.
803;His job is to help people have the time to talk and listen to each other, growing in passion because of common interests.
804;Friends of his are willing to speak candidly with him, challenging his assumptions about love and life.
805;i highly recommend this movie as one of my top romantic comedies, finding the innuendoes and language the only major drawbacks.
806;After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie.
807;I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie.
808;I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film.
809;It touches the heart and leaves you feeling good.
810;Will Smith is brilliant in his comedic timing about how even the love expert can be a fool in love.
811;hes so original and unique with great comdeic timing.
812;But Kevin James totally steals every scene.
813;Great acting, directing, writing and editing.
814;Super perfectly paced film and fun fluff.
815;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a laugh!
816;All in all, it's a pretty clean movie.
817;As for the extra features, they're pretty good.
818;It's worth having in your collection
819;Bought this at a great price for a blue ray.
820;I can watch this movie over and over.
821;This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again .
822;With Will Smith as the charming ladies man and love doctor, Eva Mendes as a sassy gossip reporter, and a hilarious Kevin James playing a hapless romantic who employs the services of the love doctor, this romantic comedy never fails to entertain.
823;That is exactly how you will be behaving after you have watched this film!
824;Will Smith`s mellow, optimistic presence makes this movie enjoyable .
825;and that`s good news for a couplet in the infatuation phase.
826;Podgy accountant Kevin James, receives love lessons from a unusually sophisticated Smith who would relish a go.
827;All very fascinating, but the irony of it is that Smith`s love life is similarly made into a muddle.
828;But this makes it all the more amusing that advice is emitted from one whose love.
829;attache` Mendes has Smith in pursuit, James vigorous attempts to impress his dream.
830;But what all this adds up to is merely a stylish date movie, harnessing both the young and old audiences.
831;Smith and James equally share a love.
832;Will Smith performs well, as per usual.
833;Despite that, I still recommend the movie as it was a mostly decent experience.
834;"Alex Hitchens, ""Hitch"" to his friends (Will Smith), has a wonderful job."
835;"Dubbed the ""Date Doctor,"" Hitch operates by word of mouth."
836;Sara is a tough cookie to crack, however, because her job reporting the break ups of others has made her extremely cynical.
837;even more importantly, the journey along the way was fun.
838;He is so smooth it is remarkable.
839;The acting was great, which really helped.
840;this is one of those rare romantic comedies that everyone seems to enjoy.
841;So if you are looking for a light film, give this one a chance.
842;As far as Will Smith movies go, its one of his best.
843;Eva Mendez is the saucy Sara, a gossip columnist who is so busy and successful at her job that she hasn't thought about romance for years.
844;"for a movie like this to work, there has to be a generous and believable dose of ""heart"" and ""Hitch"" has it."
845;The actual character has professional morals and ethics.
846;How Hitch sidesteps the guy is the right mixture of heart and machismo.
847;But there were some honest belly laughs, and more thought than usual into the wittier than usual script.
848;The Mrs. and I give 2 thumbs up!
849;Kevin James, stealing every scene, really makes a great combo with Will Smith.
850;if you're a good guy, you will enjoy this movie.
851;I think he's really good on action/comedy movies.
852;Hitch is a comedy based on a formula going back decades and decades .
853;But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable.
854;Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.
855;Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success.
856;His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress.
857;It's the performances that make this movie work.
858;Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny.
859;My sister went to the movies and saw this movie with her boyfriend, they both had really liked it and thought it was one of Will's best films.
860;My husband had wanted to see it (well sort of he was going to give it a shot b/c of Will Smith) so when it came out of video we watched it and oh boy it has got to be one of the most funniest movie that Will Smith has been in.
861;"It is the perfect ""date"" movie it his aimed at guys and gals."
862;"at the end my husband looked at me and smiled, ""Now that is a chick flick I can handle!"""
863;"It tries a bit too hard to feel like Jerry Maguire (there is even a scene where one of the characters is watching the famous ""You complete me"" scene), but Will Smith is admirable in the lead as a ""date doctor"" who encounters a little trouble when trying to find love himself."
864;crafted and there are a few funny moments, especially in some of the scenes with co. star Kevin James.
865;It starts out a little slow, but then once the plot thickens, it gets really funny and stays that way till the end.
866;When I left the first one, I said I wanted to see it again and that is unusual for me!
867;This movie has an interesting storyline to keep you entertained.
868;Whether you're watching it for the first time or the tenth, the story and characters will make you want to watch it again and again.
869;I went to see this with a friend of mine.
870;It has a great story line and many hilarious and unexpected scenes.
871;Great for all ages, and has little language.
872;"Will Smith has so much charm and charisma
873;In this movie, he plays Alex Hitchins, """"Hitch"""", a date doctor who helps guys with two left feet shape up so that they can make a good impression on the women they want to win."""
874;Eva Mendes is smart and feisty as Sara, who is supposedly a predatory gossip columnist.
875;The film has two (well, three) intersecting sub.
876;This movie is great for teenagers, women and men as well.
877;It is a laugh at loud, romantic comedy that anybody who has been in a dating situation can relate to.
878;Will Smith delivers in another great movie, and Eva Mendes is surprisingly a good actress as well as amazingly beautiful.
879;This is definitely a yes movie!
880;It was funny and it was heartwarming !
881;This was one of the best comedies that I have seen all year!
882;Hitch is a great movie, hands down.
883;Will Smith was born to play Hitch.
884;This movie is very funny and uplifting, you wont be disapointed.
885;This movie has its bright moments and some of the film reminded me of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor and Boomerang.
886;Will Smith is entertaining as the date doctor who secretly helps a lot of guys win girls that they would never have a chance with otherwise.
887;"His big assignment is to help a basically nice though ""bumbling"" guy win the heart of a Paris Hilton type heiress."
888;Many of the training scenes were in the trailer but are still extremely entertaining seeing them again in the film.
889;Granted the exchange between the two during their first meeting in a bar is excellent.
890;"James goes to Smith for help and Smith takes him under his wing telling the ways he has to get her attention and James succeds as he starts to become her new ""man""."
891;It's a good Romantic Comedy but I dont think Mendes is the right one for Smith.
892;Kevin James is great and Smith redeems himself from the rubble that was I, Robot last year.
893;"You is a very fluid concept right now, states ""Hitch"", a dating consultant, who calls himself the ""dating doctor""."
894;He helps a variety of guys meet the love of their life by setting up circumstances to help get them noticed and on dates, and the rest is up to them.
895;The results are often hilarious.
896;while the movie is funny, and Will Smith is his typical self, this one has some real relationship depth to it.
897;The characters likable, and the courtships and dating are at times awkwardly realistic.
898;This movie is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is enjoyable from the opening credits to the end.
899;In this day and age where most comedies have to resort to crass and offensive humor, this one is a gem.
900;Its nice to know someone out there still knows how to make a decent comedy.
901;Good acting, good story, good plot and a good ending.
902;He will show you just what you need to do to win her over, and tell you what mistakes to avoid.
903;He knows all this from observation.
904;He has seen what works, and wants to share his knowledge.
905;will Smith does a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that movie.
906;Kevin James steals almost every scene that he is in as the unlucky in love Albert.
907;They are the reasons that this movie works, and is very funny at times.
908;Hitch is a good date movie, and a funnier than average film.
909;is good in this movie.
910;he is a great actor and was extremely believable!
911;The movie brings back all those times you look like an idiot in front of the one you are trying to impress and they still like you!
912;hit film, one more notably found during a time period at the box office that has been particularly dead.
913;anticipated, film but the question still remains as to whether he truly has what it takes inside to deliver the hit film the studio needs whenever they demand it of him.
914;His philosophy of relationships is actually quite simple .
915;comedy feature that has come before its time, adhering to the same basic blueprint storyline and committing the exact sins and vices as has been accustomed for audiences, boyfriends at least, but in turn does so with such convincing style and flare that it does not become a hindrance at all.
916;Andy Tennant, the director who also helmed the Reese Witherspoon surprise.
917;hit, Sweet Home Alabama, has clearly acquired a knack of sorts for this particular genre, or maybe it actually is more along the lines of hand.
918;picking the right actors, or actresses, in the lead roles that allows these films to connect with audiences so readily.
919;hours effort worth the price of admission, especially on a Valentine's Day weekend.
920;will Smith is positively charming, witty, and, must it be said, stylish in the role of Alex Hitchens, also known as the date doctor.
921;comedy genre, or comedies in general, is the precise arena in which Smith should use to his benefit his charming comedic stick as opposed to dramas of a semi.
922;Now if only lead roles, of which he will receive in the not too distant future, will be as easily accomplished as this.
923;But, on the more optimistic side of things, this film does conveniently provide with an opportunity to take that special someone out to catch a charming, if not often clich filled, romantic comedy.
924;Here is yet another example of a high.
925;This helps separate this picture from the rest of the drawn.
926;flicks' past that this film has managed successfully to avoid is the bubble.
927;line, Hitch gets its point across though in the fact that through our lives we will have the fortunate opportunity to meet a wide.
928;Hitch shows Will Smith at his best .
929;funny, original and at times sophisticated.
930;As Alex Hitchinson (short Hitch), he is the date doctor who shows poor souls how to impress women and treat them well.
931;The visually appealing couple hits it off after some smart but sincere moves on the part of Hitch.
932;without wanting to spoil any of the essential parts of this movie, it's a hilarious flick for guys, girls, couples and just everybody interested in a quick LAUGH that lasts the whole two hours :))The dance scene at the end is hilarious.
933;new York looks beautiful in many scenes.
934;When this movie was not taking itself too seriously and almost spoofing the romantic comedy, it was very good.
935;It was funny in a lot of parts, and the actors had very good chemistry.
936;He was never afraid of making a fool of himself, and you could tell that he and Will Smith were having a lot of fun working off each other.
937;Eva Mendes played bitter very well.
938;She also showed she has very good comedic chops and was not just eye candy.
939;It is a good date night movie.
940;But the extraordinary charm of the three lead actors make up for a great deal, if not for everything.
941;If there's ever been a black Cary Grant, then certainly it's Smith, with his smooth, airy yet masculine charm and seemingly effortless gift for comedy.
942;"He and his leading lady, Eva Mendes, have loads of sexy chemistry together, while as one of Smith's ""Date Doctor"" clients, Kevin James is the most lovable cinematic overweight slob since the late John Candy."
943;life overweight slob, I salute him.)
944;So this movie gets three stars.
945;i Loved this movie and We ALL Love Will Smith.
946;He has humor, class, and intelligence along with appeal!
947;Perhaps one with his wife would be a fun comedy.
948;There are definitely some quotable quotes in this movie!
949;Will Smith is charming as Alex Hitchens who helps relationship.
950;You will enjoy Hitch's charm as much as his crazy exploits in trying to capture a woman of his own.
951;This film is original, and that alone recommends it, but if that's not enough, you have an entertaining storyline and stellar performances by the entire cast.
952;It is pure entertainment at its best and relatively cleanest!
953;I also enjoyed the music on this film, but I think it could have been made unforgettable with a special theme song.
954;He is pretty much the bright spot of the film&that ain't saying much.
955;the story line was cool.
956;This was kind of funny in certain parts but it's one of those old tales I keep seeing in Hollywood: boy and girl meet, boy has a secret, girl discovers it, there's a misunderstanding, they hate each other and then they love each other.
957;many funny scenes in the previews, many expectations of the actors, and many people telling me how good it was.
958;The movie followed through and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
959;The plot was original, and creative, and pretty darn funny.
960;hearted comedy, I'd recommend this movie for any audience.
961;I thought this movie was very funny.
962;The story was interesting enough to keep me interested.
963;I've always thought that Will Smith is a great actor.
964;Will Smith will always be Will Smith in his movies.
965;Most of the funny scenes are the ones you see in the previews and the funniest of them all is the second dance scene that happens right before the end credits.
966;This is a great date film that most guys will enjoy too.
967;sappy in parts, but there is enough relationship humor to keep it interesting.
968;Got it at a good value, delivered right on time, and arrived in perfect condition.
969;One of the better romantic comedies I've seen in a while.
970;I was very happy to see Kevin James in this film.
971;He really steals the show considering the screen time devoted to him.
972;The relationship between Kevin's character and the upscale object of his affection is very believable.
973;Will Smith is very good as usual and his story adds a good contrast to the people he helps win their dreams girls.
974;All in all it is a funny lighthearted film that I enjoyed.
975;"A ""date doctor"" helps a loser get the girl, but can't help himself get one."
976;"i thought all the ""deep advice"" on how to get a woman was kind of funny and over the top some of the time."
977;I am hard to please when it comes to comedies, but this movie shines with me!
978;This was a very cute, lighthearted movie.
979;Everyone delivered solid performances in this movie!
980;There were NO forced jokes, everything was genuinely funny!
981;Funny, cute, lighthearted, and entertaining.
982;Hitch has proved to be a very good date movie!
983;This is one of those movies that someone in the house, and often all of us, will watch once a year.
984;Our late teenagers and ourselves find it funny, clever, original .
985;perfect on one of those nights when you don't want to think about the movie and just enjoy it.
986;He never really has done a romantic comedic film until now and newsflash.
987;Alex Hitchins role seems to be made for Will Smith by the way that he can harness and make the role his own with a lot of his own personality evidently being drawn through this part.
988;"alex Hitchins is a consultant ""love doctor"" that helps out love struck men land the ""girl of their dreams"" despite their own geeky and clumsy persona."
989;the movie has a very good mix of comedy with romanticism.
990;I have seen him and actually loved him on the tv series King of Queens.
991;He is an amazing, loveble and funny charecter and am so glad he made this step in to the Hollywood Movies.
992;I myself give it 2 thumbs up.
993;HITCH is a great movie.
994;I love Will Smith, but Kevin James steals the show!!
995;What fun to watch these two as they interact.
996;Two great comedy actors Kevin James and Will Smith together in one movie, I doubt this movie can be THAT bad.
997;And as I thought, its not bad at all.
998;Will Smith was just great, but I didn't expect anything less.
999;an enjoyable and refreshingly charming and funny movie.
1000;There's good laughing and then there's just.
1001;Watch this movie, its worth it.
1002;This is the best romantic comady that i really enjoyed and i hope that girls from all ages learn to be open minded and give a chance for every cool guy that cant express himself infront girls .
1003;this film best part for me is when they say it loud and clear that men are not all the same and that men try their best to get the girl that they like and the girls should give 'em a chance and take their time to know the guy .
1004;"Will Smith and Kevin James, (TV's ""The King of Queens"") are awesome."
1005;loud funny, has romance and drama as well.
1006;Great movie over all, in my opinion.
1007;Last week, I got the chance to see Hitch, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, and Amber Valetta.
1008;"In this movie, Alex Hitchens (Smith) serves as a ""date doctor"" for men looking to impress the women they love."
1009;It will take all of Hitch's charms, as well as a (literal) leap of faith, to find out what love really is all about.
1010;All of the characters are likable and entertaining, particularly Kevin James as Albert Brennaman.
1011;(James does alot of cute physical comedy, and he's a very relatable character.)
1012;It would be a great date flick, and there are happy endings all around.
1013;Hilarious movie that my husband and I enjoy watching together.
1014;It is rooted in the Capitalistic.
1015;This I call the creation of a beuty ideal: causing both men and women to look for a certain beuty ideal, created by the media, and so, eventually, every person they choose to spend their lives with, would be a compromise.
1016;On the other hand it serves that very ideal that prevents any guy to get any girl, and vice versa.
1017;as a movie it was nice.
1018;It was funny and charming and exciting, although it could've been shorter, in my opinion.
1019;I personally thought the movie was cute and I laughed at a lot of the scenes.
1020;He's cute, adorable, and oh, yeah.
1021;And of course, Will Smith played Will Smith.
1022;And though this film does just about everything right, I found myself frustrated with the end.
1023;Still it was a good movie.
1024;Hitch is a 2005 romantic comedy film starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valletta.
1025;"alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Will Smith) is a professional ""date doctor"", or consultant as Hitch terms himself, who coaches other men in the art of having the perfect date with the woman of their dreams."
1026;night stand with her best friend.
1027;"Hitch, reflecting on love's unpredictability, addresses the audience in the last line, ""Basic principles."
1028;"[3] The working title of the movie was The Last First Kiss, referring to a line that Hitch delivers to Albert: ""This could be her last first kiss."""
1029;highest grossing film of 2005.
1030;It also grossed $368,100,420 worldwide and broke Sony's record for best opening weekend for a romantic.
1031;The movie is recent, the content is tame and very bright.
1032;So if you are watching on a projector or some other form of hi res screen, you can actually see the difference.
1033;The good thing about both is that they are shipping now!
1034;The Bottom Line:Though fans of the romantic comedy might like seeing Will Smith work his charm on Eva Mendes, anyone who prefers that movies make an attempt to rise above formulaity will be disappointed.
1035;Hitch is one of these movies that goes for the heart and is quite successful for the most part except where a few scenes towards the end overrun it a bit.
1036;The introduction of Kevin James as Albert marks a new comedy actor on the rise and we can be sure to see plenty more of him.
1037;class fashion slave acolytes and executive board members make up Hitch's main customers and so we are definitely on `Sex in the City' ground that has taken a few lessons from old movies with the same sort of theme.
1038;This `Love Doctor' comedy is easily one of the better pleasantry surprises you will see in 2005.
1039;The first time I watched, I laughed out loud.
1040;Kevin James and Will Smith are a great duo!
1041;One of his main focuses during the movie is an accountant played by a thinner Kevin James (compared to the first couple of seasons in King of Queens).
1042;Kevin's character is attracted to a beautiful heiress played by Cameron Diaz.
1043;the movie's greatest feature is being able to show just about every aspect or viewpoint one would have about starting a relationship, from the lovesick to the downright sick of love individuals.
1044;the writing and acting are very well done, mostly because they keep Amber's lines to a minimum.
1045;i would highly recommend this movie for a date, especially a first date.
1046;Like I said, it's a great date movie.
1047;Will Smith's 2005 movie, HITCH had a pretty good story line.
1048;Smith was delightful in the title role.
1049;But it's Kevin James (TV's The King Of Queens) who steals the show.
1050;Great movie for a couple who are in love or experiencing problems in a relationship.
1051;The movie is in excellent working condition with no issues.
1052;I just love this movie so i'm happy there were no scratches.
1053;Played right though with no issues.
1054;In his words, he creates the opportunity for them.
1055;One of these guys happens to be Albert who has a thing for Allegra, the rich and beautiful multi.
1056;Meanwhile, Alex meets Sara who's a gossip columnist and sparks fly.
1057;The thing with this kind of movies is the story.
1058;A good romantic comedy should evoke some kind of emotions.
1059;The starting 10.15 minutes was great, and I was actually looking forward to the movie.
1060;And most of the funny scenes are actually in the movie trailer.
1061;kevin James, who I really like in King Of Queens is underused here.
1062;If you want good romantic comedies, get Hugh Grant's movies.
1063;Being a fan of both Wil Smith and Kevin James, I came into watching this one with a positive attitude, but was still pleasantly surprised at how (comparatively) good this thing was.
1064;This one is a surprise, with a lot of good dialogue, mostly well.
1065;rounded characters and capable direction.
1066;Feel good chick flick that is made for guys.
1067;Nice to see the dance move seen again.
1068;"I know it was always Paris that held the title of ""The City of Love"", but with this charming film, New York City could be a contender for the honor."
1069;Too often, Hollywood delivers a beautiful love story that can leave an audience yearning for such feelings in our own lives.
1070;Hitch shows another side of romance movies.
1071;That's just one factor that makes this movie worth watching.
1072;"Will Smith plays a ""date doctor"" whose advice I could certainly use and want and Kevin James plays a love."
1073;This cast tells their story against one of the finest backdrops in the world, New York City.
1074;The location and the cast's talents make this a truely romantic story worth watching over and over again.
1075;At one point, Will Smith's character believes that his real talent is simply giving guys like Kevin James's character the confidence to get the woman of their dreams and suggests that this is no big deal in the big picture that is a subsequent relationship.
1076;"confidence is a huge part of it and I'd certainly like a ""date doctor"" to help me out in that department."
1077;I really enjoyed this movie.
1078;Will Smith was great and there was plenty of laughter coming from the audience.
1079;I laughed throughout the entire movie.
1080;It's a must see movie for those who like comedies.
1081;If you love Will Smith and romantic comedies, you'll love HITCH!!!
1082;I love this movie and have watched tens of times.
1083;This certainly fit the bill.
1084;breaking funny at points, sad, sincere, optimistic.
1085;Not to mention great acting.
1086;Not just a date flick, but a fun laid.
1087;I cant really say this is a great flick because at the beginning when he meets the girl you know he will win her at the end.
1088;Great movie and I highly recommend it and it was hysterically funny.
1089;Will Smith was great in the role and a gray dating storyline.
1090;But to make her happy i agreed to watch it and i have got to say i was shocked because i liked it.
1091;He made a life choice to do it for a living helping out guys who without his extensive knowledge of women wouldn't stand much of a chance.
1092;Enter Kevin James who plays an accountant who is absolutely in love with a rich and famous girl.
1093;He went to hitch for his help.
1094;this film is surprisingly good.
1095;It really makes you think and im sure it is a great confidence boost for guys who have issues talking to girls.
1096;This film will have you laughing one minute and the next hoping the relationship works out.
1097;the acting is all great, Will Smith did a great job playing a guy who knows a lot about women and getting people into relationships but is afraid of relationships of his own.
1098;Eva did a great job of playing the sexy but emotionally unavailable workaholic who is falling in love with Smith.
1099;this movie wont disappoint you it is outstanding 4/5 stars.
1100;Its great for a date night or a romantic night planned for that special someone who may not want an action movie and rather a drama.
1101;The film does however have a marginal understanding of relationships coupled with some pretty good acting.
1102;In actuality, he maintains his composure only occasionally screwing up, but he always seems to screw up in good will, making understandable mistakes.
1103;the film pays special attention to the characters' self.
1104;It understands how hard it is for a man to start a meaningful relationship with a perfect stranger, but it also shows that women go though the same feelings.
1105;Between the two, Virgin is the superior film, but Hitch still works.
1106;Hitch is definitely worth the watch.
1107;the action is silly and funny.
1108;I had to watch it twice!
1109;It was well worth the second viewing!
1110;This movie was an absolutely funny comedy!
1111;I absolutely love this movie, I can really recommend it!
1112;go and see it, it's worth your money.
1113;It's about a man( Will Smith)who really got it going on, who has his act together so to speak.
1114;He is smart,sophisticated and not forget to mention good.
1115;cool Hitch to teach them how to capture the hearts of women.
1116;Hitch is good at it, too, an impressive number of his clients have gotten 'hitched' to the ladies of their dreams.
1117;The man certainly needs help.
1118;Hitch is a good afternoon's fun and definitely worth watching.
1119;Until the final ten minutes of HITCH, this was one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a long time.
1120;The premise was fairly original, though in a way an inversion of the Cyrano de Bergerac theme.
1121;how nice to see Will Smith in a romantic role!
1122;And how refreshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!
1123;Interracial relationships are common today, so it is nice to see Hollywood stop pretending that they don't occur.
1124;Smith has never been funnier than in this one, and the scene in which he suffers an allergic reaction to shellfish is about as funny as I have seen in a while (the make up is exceptional in that scene).
1125;She is much better served in this film, and she acquits herself admirably.
1126;She has a feistiness and projects a confidence that I really like.
1127;Model Amber Valletta is fine as Allegra, the object of Albert's affections, but since she is quite attractive in an arm.
1128;trophy sort of way, she was perfect for the role.
1129;"Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him ""bang"" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on."
1130;i will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.
1131;That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.
1132;Anything with Will Smith is awesome and worth it.
1133;(I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co. worker sidekicks is a light.
1134;you want to know what a good girl wants, watch this movie!
1135;Besides being hilariously funny and inspiring, it definitely helps guys to understand what a girl is looking for in a mate.
1136;Ok so you are probably wondering what I thought of this move .
1137;this is a great story and the perfect vehicle for Will Smith to play the cool and world smart tutor for men who have no hope in the world of ever developing a relationship with a woman.
1138;this is definitely a 'date' movie or one could say a 'chick flick' but trust me it's a hoot and the viewer never really knows wher in the world the story is going .
1139;it certainly has been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a great story, great movien and great acting .
1140;third, anyone loved by family and friends recognizes how it feels to be loved without sex, so love with or without sex will find them again.
1141;in the movie, Hitch loved and was deeply hurt early in life, so he decides never to love again, but to help other dorks avoid his prior mistakes and find true love.
1142;Hitch is a paid consultant in love: new teeth, work outs (or liposuction), new hair, new clothes, new glasses, new dance steps, confidence, power tie, power suit, power car, power hand shake.
1143;"The resolution of this hilarious movie is heart warming psychobabble: anyone who can appreciate you as yourself probably loves the genuine you
1144;hitch sees externals as first attractants only: meeting is a matter of luck (orchestrated by Hitch or your local plastic surgeon), keeping a relationship happily intact relies on the old standards: mental health, duty, responsibility, honor, fidelity, probity, commitment to doing what is right and true to the best of one's ability, being yourself.
1145;Laughingly recommended with 5 stars.
1146;be yourself: empathic, trustworthy, honest, impeccable in your ethics and morals, and willing to humble yourself enough to make changes in preconceived notions of what is desirable.
1147;If love finds you, it is karma, if not, you are still a remarkable unique human being, there will never be another you (Rosemary ClooneyThe Rosemary Clooney Show: Songs from the Classic TV Seriessinging inThe Lake House (Full Screen Edition)).
1148;Perhaps you will find a way to share that specialness with the world.
1149;You are perfect just the way you are, be well.
1150;also seeThe Family Man,The Story of Us,Departures, August Rush, Dan in Real Life about men allowing love to find them after they've found themselves
1151;I ordered the movie to watch on my Kindle during a flight, and was completely captivated the whole trip.
1152;It will leave you smiling and feeling good.
1153;Will Smith does an incredible job in playing Hitch and I've found myself laughing over and over at the antics both he, and the other characters, present.
1154;I went to see this movie last Sunday, it was a dreary, nasty day outside and we decided to brave the elements and walk the 4 blocks to the theater.
1155;It was totally worth it.
1156;Will Smith is great, as is Kevin James and Eva Mendes.
1157;There were several other unknowns who did a great job.
1158;I love the """"rich heiress who has a heart"""" ."""
1159;I highly recommend this if you're looking for a light.
1160;it is a good date movie!
1161;His latest client also stands to be his biggest triumph as a goofy account Albert, played by Kevin James hires Hitch to help catch the eye of the socialite, Allegra Cole, who is a client at his firm.
1162;but Hitch's greatest success could be in trouble when he meets a jaded woman that he tries to woo who just so happens to have a gossip column that regularly focuses on Allegra's dating life.
1163;But since this is a romantic comedy, hilarity ensues instead, or at least tries too.
1164;overall it was a decent movie with a couple good laughs even though most of the movie, much like every romantic comedy, was extremely predictable.
1165;The Greatest movie i ever Saw.
1166;A love doc who helped others, later fell in love, and eventually found out what love really was.
1167;It stood above the rest because of, first, the chemistry between the ever enchanting Will Smith and the main supporting actor who played a fat lousy accountant going after a beautiful blonde celebrity, and second, the very intelligent scripts, such as:.
1168;60% of all human communication is non verbal body language.
1169;A beautiful woman doesnt know what she wants, until she sees it.
1170;It's the moments that take your breath away.
1171;Anyway, this is a good movie to kill time.
1172;The several minutes in the opening will definitely become a classic.
1173;Will Smith nailed the role for this movie and it was a cute feel good romantic comedy!!!!!!
1174;Will plays a love doctor by the name of Hitch and he makes love connections for those that don't have a special someone!!!!!!
1175;If you love romantic cute feel good movies then you really need to watch this movie and who knows maybe you should watch this movie with your love one!!!!!
1176;The movie has a great cast and the story is charming and i love that they filmed it in New York!!!!!!!
1177;It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene (minus the above antics), and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through.
1178;I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you.
1179;This is a movie about dating and it's a good time movie for all.
1180;Will Smith helps others find the right mate and it shows Ellis Island where a lot of people entered the United States.
1181;Eva Mendes does a great role in here too.
1182;Will Smith is the best, and this movie has all the right stuff .
1183;comedy, romance, drama, a mix of happy and sad moments.
1184;I thinks it's a great date, or family movie.
1185;There are no explosions, or car crashes, but most guys I know really enjoyed this movie.
1186;Good movie for anyone, and something we can all pretty much relate to.
1187;Hitch is better than a lot of the trying.
1188;"Will finds his own ""challenge"", and the comedy of Will and his prot g acquiring their respective women makes for an awesomely realistic, modern day (macho!)"
1189;He's become a veteran entertainer.
1190;Kevin James (King of Queens) is hilarious as the accountant, trying to win the heart of his boss.
1191;Eva Mendes is a lovely presence on the screen as the gossip columnist who uncovers Hitch's secret.
1192;The story is wonderful, original and doesn't take itself too seriously.
1193;It's a refreshing change of pace and will entertain all who watch.
1194;I'm a Will Smith fan.
1195;He has good timing and a fun style.
1196;That said, this is a pretty good departure for him.
1197;His leading lady I could have done without.
1198;She totally DID mean to hurt him!
1199;, but overall it kept me entertained.
1200;`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour.
1201;The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style.
1202;From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.
1203;Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for.
1204;will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor.
1205;Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics.
1206;the movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!RecommendedA.
1207;Hitch is the perfect date movie or a movie for a guy who's having low self.
1208;Andy Tennant (director) did a wonderful job making this movie.
1209;This is the Best Movie you will ever come across to spark the beginning Year of 2005.
1210;The movie has everything in it, comedy, romance, action(few), ect.
1211;I have nothing else to say about this movie but that it is the best dating movie ever!
1212;I bought this movie for my dad for Christmas.
1213;Will Smith is awesome and the movie has lots of laughs.
1214;A romantic comedy that makes you fall in love with the characters, each one becomes special, Will Smith never fail he has great taste in movies.
1215;Why do they do that?Hitch is a date advisor who gets geeks hooked up with gorgeous girls who wouldn't look at them otherwise.
1216;This is a funny movie and the service and satisfaction I receive from Amazon always fully meets my expectations
1217;Movie came sealed with outer wrap and stickers on the outside.
1218;tall, dark, handsome, suave, outgoing and humorous.
1219;"This is quite a change of pace for him since Will is such a huge star of some of Hollywood's biggest action blockbusters (""Men In Black"", ""Independence Day"", ""Bad Boys"", ""I, Robot"", ""Enemy of the State"")
1220;He's good at what he does, but only because he was once very much like his clients .
1221;He is able to parlay his skills into a very lucrative yet inconspicuous career for himself and he wants to keep it that way.
1222;He is secretly in love with a rich heiress/socialite, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta, """"What Lies Beneath"""", """"Premonition"""")."""
1223;I thought the scenes between Will and Kevin were hilarious, and they have great on.
1224;Hope to see them paired up in something again in the future.
1225;Having his heart broken years earlier has left a lasting impression on Hitch, so he doesn't allow himself to get too close to people he's attracted to .
1226;i really enjoyed this movie up until three.
1227;It has its flaws, but it is definitely worth watching, and one of the better romantic comedies that have been released in the past few years.
1228;This is a movie that both men and women can watch and really enjoy .
1229;I also loved the music and being a lifelong native New Yorker, it was fun recognizing the locations where almost every scene was shot.
1230;This explains why the actress who played her, Robinne Lee, is listed as a major member of the cast in the opening credits .
1231;This is a fantastic story about a love doctor and his client with a lot of heart and comedy!
1232;I'm not one to easily be made to laugh at a movie.
1233;Well, its gotta be pretty darn funny.
1234;Will Smith and Kevin James are immediately likable as contrasted characters who become buddies.
1235;cool act and perfectly delivered one.
1236;Kevin is so endearing with his sincere adoration and brilliant comedic facial expressions and line delivery.
1237;Creative fun and big laughs all the way through!
1238;"thanks)I am here to tell you that ""Hitch"" is a very good romantic comedy and you will enjoy it, especially with your Spouse."
1239;this movie has 2 stories, you see the hilarious ways that Alex and Albert interact during their times together as Alex teaches albert how to dance, kiss, be suave, cool, be a ladies man and a overall good date to try to catch the attention of the rich woman.
1240;And you see Alex who for other people is a good advice giver but for his own love life he can't seem to do anything right.
1241;kevin james plays a great supporting role alongside Will smith,As his On.
1242;"hitch is a Very Smartly written movie, it kind of feels like your watching a ""Dating for Dummies"" movie with all the tips you get from Alex but it's one of my favorite for 2005."
1243;screen chemistry between Kevin and Will+some hilarious moments+Will Smith at his bestNegatives.
1244;"Another favorite part, Will taking Eve to Ellis Island and finding out about her relative who first come to America and all
1245;Hitch (Will Smith) is a professional date doctor.
1246;Hitch spots her in a crowded bar one night and strikes up a conversation.
1247;Hitch, released rather fortuitously the Friday before Valentine's Day, broke a number of box office records it's opening weekend.
1248;Everything about the film is designed to make women go `aaaah, Will Smith is so cute.
1249;'The film is a pleasant diversion, but it only works sporadically.
1250;The film is at it's best when the story centers on Albert, the Kevin James character.
1251;He has a couple of scenes of inspired comedy, which surely must have been adlibbed.
1252;One scene, in which he demonstrates to Hitch how he would dance is the funniest thing I have seen in some time.
1253;Smith and Mendes are certainly likable enough as actors, and their first date is slightly amusing.
1254;It brings the entire film down.
1255;the funniest bit with Smith is the very beginning of the film as we eavesdrop on him working with three clients.
1256;Its fun to watch how he helps them win the ladies of their dreams.
1257;the technical aspect of the film is okay.
1258;The fairly straight forward approach works for the story.
1259;Everyone lives in a great apartment in New York City, enjoys going out all the time and are basically burning up the town.
1260;What """"Hitch"""" does well is provide a very nice portrait of New York City."""
1261;It looks like a fun place to live.
1262;Love, love, love Will Smith and paired with Doug from King of Queens makes it even funnier!
1263;This is a clever romantic comedy that has something for everyone.
1264;Great for some laughs, a good story and movie to relax with.
1265;Will Smith does a great job!
1266;I think this is one of the better romantic comedies I have seen.
1267;I thought the concept was fresh and new.
1268;It was great to see a movie about dating from a man's point of view (and not the point of view of just hooking up with the girl and ditching her!)
1269;He helps regular guys get girls that wouldn't normally give them a chance.
1270;I loved Will Smith in this role.
1271;We are big fans of Kevin James and Will Smith!
1272;a great moment of fun with great acting from will smith.
1273;a very positively minded romantic plot with a lot of laughing.
1274;"It's an oldie but a goody
1275;There is something in this movie for everyone.
1276;The cast has great chemistry.
1277;This movie has comedy as well as a metaphor.
1278;I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
1279;If you happened to be a romantically challenged person like myself, Then """"Hitch""""sounds like the best movie worth seeing."""
1280;There are some parts of the movie where I laughed and laughed some more This was a Brilliant film for Will Smith.
1281;Kevin James was great in his big.
1282;Eva Mendez looks absolutely great She'll probably be THE sexiest woman.
1283;One of the best parts of this film happens to be Will drop.
1284;This is indeed a good date film You won't be totally disapppointed!
1285;This is a very cute romantic comedy.
1286;Yes, boy and girl come out happy in the end.
1287;the film has two stories, both of which are not particularly original, but told with a delightful touch and considerable energy.
1288;in the other, we find more unique story and talents .
1289;a date with a celebrity, beautiful and (very) rich female Allegra (Amber Valletta).
1290;The big problem is, Albert, so smitten, so good.
1291;the direction of Andy Tennant ('Ever After') is a strange mixture of slapsticks, witty dialogues, and romantic mood.
1292;And very funny and likable Kevin James as Albert steals almost every scene in the film.
1293;A bit familiar as romantic comedy perhaps, but very cute 'Hitch' with equally cute characters reminds us that this city is and will be a beloved place for every film lover.
1294;Overall, a very good movie.
1295;Lots of laughs and well written.
1296;"Displaying that he can handle the lead role in a romantic comedy just as easily as he can handle every other genre in the field, Will Smith shines in HITCH as Alex Hitchens, aka ""The Date Doctor."""
1297;Hitch helps average guys gain the attention and win the hearts of the women of their dreams.
1298;Allegra Cole is a celebrity and has all the money, fame, power, and beauty that comes with her station.
1299;This is a romantic comedy, so even the most improbable scenarios become likely and soon Albert finds himself dating the famous Allegra Cole.
1300;Hitch is a true genius at setting up scenarios for his clients, but all of the tricks he uses to help his clients have the opposite effect when he uses them with Sara.
1301;There's no better way to explain it because Smith is Hitch.
1302;Every gesture, move, and spoken phrase seems perfect.
1303;Hitch is a role that Smith was born to play.
1304;Eva Mendes is a beautiful woman, but she's also incredibly talented.
1305;She holds her own against one of Hollywood's most powerful actors.
1306;Kevin James does an excellent job as the film's pivotal.
1307;i tend to like most genres of movies as long as there is a good story involved.
1308;The movie has a good story, great actors, and solid direction.
1309;It's both funny and tender.
1310;Unlike many movies in he genre, HITCH is a movie that a person can enjoy watching by themselves just as much as watching it with a loved one.
1311;recommended for fans of romantic comedies, fans of Will Smith, fans of Eva Mendes, and fans of Kevin James.
1312;I was pleasantly surprised at this movie.
1313;Will Smith stars as a modern day matchmaker type, who has a deep romantic streak himself.
1314;There were some very funny moments in the movie, some very touching moments, and some scenes very unpredictable.
1315;kevin James did a great job as his role in this movie as an accountant in love with a celebrity and their courtship.
1316;He is an actor that nearly always makes me laugh.
1317;great, fun film to watch and have a laugh at.
1318;This movie has style and though the plot is predictable, the characters are engaging and believable.
1319;"smooth as Alex Hitchens, a ""date doctor"" who mentors nerdy."
1320;honestly, Kevin James is fabulous in this movie as Al.
1321;His relationship with Allegra is occassionally more engaging than even the feature romance between Hitch and Sara.
1322;the dialogue is well executed.
1323;There is a great scene when Hitch first meets Sara in a bar after Sara has dismissed a guy who tries to pick her up.
1324;Because the dialogue is so witty and fresh, the movie comes off easily.
1325;all in all, this was funny, original, and great to watch.
1326;I bought this for him for Valentine's gift.
1327;Funny and witty as always.
1328;"Otherwise ""Hitch"" is a great movie."
1329;Great movie, arrived in perfect condition.
1330;I laughed a lot and the connection Will Smith and Eva Mendes have is only exceeded by the chemistry that Albert Brennaman and Will have.
1331;this movie is absolutely nauseating.
1332;As much as I didn't want to like this film, I loved it.
1333;will Smith is Handsome, Gorgeous, and any other adjective you can come up with to describe fine!!!
1334;His acting was excellent and his costars were great.
1335;and 30% raw physical humor.
1336;30 is good, hang in there.
1337;one personal image consultant for those one.
1338;He's found out by a member of the target sex (hetero, so that means ladies here), and bad things and happy endings follow.
1339;Eva Mendez ('Sara') is pretty and earnest.
1340;walks away with the show in his pocket.
1341;He does a lot in this movie, all good, but it's his physical humor that grabs the show and drags it home behind him.
1342;He has mastered the prat.
1343;pants scene, the embarassing dance, and the million other daily experiences of the human male.
1344;important mugging (c'mon guys, did your date ever get you onto the front page?
1345;The Date Doctor's advice is worth heeding, too.
1346;I thought this was a good comedy about how men and women communicate and how little things tend to get in the way of a great relationship.
