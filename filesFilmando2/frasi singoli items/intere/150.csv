1;He is one of the best actors in the whole world!
2;What a fun film and a great exercise in social studies.
3;But Hoffman is the best what range.
4;This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time.
5;This movie is one of Dustin Hoffman's best, right up there with The Graduate and Rainman.
6;Bill Murray has some priceless moments as well.
7;I believe it also contains Geena Davis's very first movie role.
8;Mr Hoffman does an excellent job in a representation of the hard time actors and actresses have to get a part or a roll to a paying acting job!
9;I must have seen 'Tootsie' over twenty times and the more I see it the more brilliant it is.
10;i love everything about it.
11;the comedy,the meaning and THE CAST!!!!!
12;all turning in terrific performances.
13;leading to this movie's funniest moments.
14;and as not to offend Julie further he finds a way to maintaina friendship with Les who admits to finding Michael Dorsey to be 'okay company'.
15;i think outside the laugh a minute comedy and the twists and turns this movie has a nice message to it about understanding sexual sensativity and the opposit sex.
16;it has to to with male/female relationships and the resulting twists and turns.
17;"I adore Dustin Hoffman and count him as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen, and even though his recent choices are less than impressive (what has happened to these acting giants
18;His comedic performance in `Tootsie' is certainly one of his grandest.
19;the performances are all outstanding, especially from Hoffman who is not only hilarious but also very connected to the emotional journey both of his characters are going through.
20;Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her performance, and while I don't consider it `amazing' it was tender and genuine and deserving of admiration (but I'm not so sure of an Oscar).
21;His performance is so sincere and moving that the Academy should be ashamed for passing him over.
22;the rest of the supporting cast is also wonderful, from the late Sydney Pollack to Teri Garr, Bill Murray and a pre.
23;the script is brilliantly crafted to be both comedic and heartwarming, and when the Dorsey/Michaels revelation is finally revealed you will find yourself on the floor in the most painfully side splitting uproarious laughter that you will feel compelled to watch the whole film all over again just so you can see that scene in all its glory (you have to watch the whole film for a proper setup).
24;Hoffman and company really deliver a film that is more than just a comedy, it is a landmark and one of the most influential and recognizable films to the 80's.
25;And so many other great actors helped make this movie a top favorite that stands the test of time.
26;It's one of my all time favorite movies.
27;Dave Grusin's music sets the mood perfectly for the various emotional rides.
28;Dustin Hoffman is, bar none, one of the finest actors in cinema today.
29;Talented, bold, daring and unafraid to take roles that truly challenge his abilities as an actor.
30;The Graduate, """"Midnight Cowboy"""", """"Kramer Vs. Kramer"""" and """"Rain Man"""" all demonstrate Hoffman's fearless attitude quite well."""
31;Dorothy auditions for the role on a popular daytime soap, and wins it.
32;things unfold in a wild, hilarious and touching manner in thsi gem of a film.
33;Hoffman is at his best and the rest of the cast lends solid support.
34;Tootsie is classic if there ever was one.
35;In my opinion, this is one of the best comedies ever made.
36;It's somewhere between the blatant slapstick of The Great Race and the witty sophistication of The Pink Panther , and it doesn't have a car chase in it, but this movie is nonstop funny from beginning to end.
37;There is humor in just about every scene, and funny lines abound.
38;Dustin Hoffman, one of the best actors of his generation, gives one of his best peformances as a tempermental actor who can't get a job and secretly tries out for a female role on a big daytime soap opera in drag.
39;Not only is Hoffman excellent, but the rest of the cast is also outstanding.
40;Jessica Lange got a best supporting actress oscar.
41;The oscar for best picture should have landed here, as well.
42;If you've never seen this one, do yourself a favor .
43;This is one Hollywood's best comedies.
44;One of those films that I could watch every few months or so.
45;My daughter said she had never seen it so we watched and laughed once again in spite of the slow streaming.
46;accurate depiction of the lot of New York's City's starving actors.
47;Hoffman's transformation into Dorothy is amazing and you can tell the cast is really having fun making this movie.
48;dustin Hoffman is fabulous as a woman!!!
49;My mom knows I am the go.
50;to person for getting her movies and she enjoys this movie very much.
51;This is such a classic movie that you should see.
52;Dustin Hoffman gives on of his funniest and greatest performances ever.
53;This film is funny and sometimes dramatic.
54;Great comedic supportive cast, writing and direction.
55;Dustin is great as Tootsie !
56;Always been a fan of Dustin Hoffman, and this movie is my favorite.
57;and the 25 year anniversary with interviews of actors made it very interesting
58;Funny lines, terrific acting, great direction.
59;to a fascinating and Oscar award.
60;winning film maker Sydney Pollack (1934.2008).
61;It still makes us laugh, cry and feel after all these years.
62;This movie is the best cross.
63;Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best (certainly his funniest) performances, and is the real star of the picture, the movie's success is largely his.
64;Jessica Lange and Teri Garr are also great.
65;Bill Murray delivers a very funny performance.
66;Sidney Pollack is perfect as Dorothy's agent, and he directs with great ease and comic flow.
67;A brilliant Oscar nominated screenplay also helped.
68;One of the few masterpieces of the 80's.
69;Very funny and touching, great fun.
70;Extras: spot a young Geena Davis in a bit part.
71;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
72;I showed this movie to my 13.
73;old son, and he absolutely LOVED it.
74;Some movies are timeless classics, and this one is great.
75;This movie is an old favorite classic hit favorite of mine.
76;It has good humor and fun.
77;I recommend it to everyone, young and old.
78;This is an adult movie in my opinion, and I mostly enjoy the interestingstory line.
79;It was summer and we were both home from college.
80;everything is in the film,Great Acting,fantastic soundtrack,and one of the greatest comedies of all time.
81;It's a movie filled with great humor, the human condition of HOPE, the promise of a better tomorrow and down right FUNNY!!
82;"I rate ""Tootsie"" 5 stars because it's humorous, the music is uplifting and the acting is superb!"
83;work actor played by Dustin Hoffman, who decides that women have it easier when getting movie parts, so he concocts a scheme unbeknowst to his agent.
84;i highly recommend this 80's film for anyone who is either a Dustin Hoffman fan, or who likes a light.
85;*(Recommended for ages 18+ above due to adult themes).
86;I saw this movie when it came out in the 80s and loved it.
87;He laughed all the way through it as I still do.
88;fun and entertaining then and now.
89;I loved this movie the first time I saw it as a kid and when I saw it offered on amazon so inexpensively, I had to add it to my (ever growing) movie collection.
90;He's a great actor and is the only one I could see doing the part of the main character.
91;TOOTSIE is the tale of Michael Dorsey, a brilliant New YorkCity actor who is unemployable, because he is so disagreeable to work with.
92;tOOTSIE has a complex and superb script, and great performances all around.
93;tOOTSIE is a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of MRS. DOUBTFIRE, highly enjoyable, and very watchable too.
94;TOOTSIE is now well and truly over 25 years old, but still remains as fresh and funny as it was when it first premiered.
95;Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray and Teri Garr star in this keenly observed Sydney Pollack gem with a genuine New York showbusiness background.
96;"Michael frocks up as ""Dorothy Michaels"" and lands a job on top."
97;"who has well and truly taken the endearing ""Dorothy"" to heart as her best friend ."
98;This is mainly due to the incredible performances but props must also be given to the outstanding screenplay from Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal.
99;Dustin Hoffman is so good at playing altar.
100;This is a great story and the actors do it justice.
101;I have watched this film about 6 times and still find new things and scenes.
102;what a wonderful role for Dustin, and the rest of the well chosen cast.
103;Always loved it, can now add it to my collection of favorite ones.
104;Another of the many superb performances by legendary film actor Dustin Hoffman.
105;This is a very funny and entertaining film about a male actor who is down on his luck as far as his career goes, and decides to take an extreme measure by assuming a female identity to land a lucrative position on a daytime soap opera.
106;"At first, the charade works
107;Hoffman really shines here as the bitter, tempermental actor who alienates the entire showbiz world.
108;My family propped up our feet and laughed and laughed.
109;Next year we can do it agtain.
110;Dustin Hoffman is priceless in this film and quite believable as a woman.
111;Tootsie was an outragiously funny movie.
112;I had blast watching this movie with two favorite women in my life.
113;Dustin Hoffman was so great in this movie.
114;He really new how to pull off a dress and heels.
115;Great performances, clever script idea.
116;female talent agent, female actor who can't get work.
117;If you need a good laugh with top notch actors add this movie to your collection.
118;this movie is a great message to both men and women in terms of identity and relationships.
119;Dustin Hoffman is just amazing in this movie.
120;So many funny lines and Terri Garr's best film ever, except maybe Young Frankenstein.
121;It's strange how seeing a man dressed up as a woman always seems to be funny and popular with the audiences.
122;Milton Berle helped make television a hit with skits like this on his early 1950s show.
123;It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.
124;helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role.
125;I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe.
126;this was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too.
127;Hoffman, a fabulous actor, has always been able to play diverse roles.
128;In fact, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
129;Bill Murray plays his roomate, and is very funny in this role, one of the funniest I've seen him in actually.
130;This movie is always a treat to watch.
131;It was great to get to watch the making of this movie.
132;Terri Garr is so awsome as his friend Sandy and Bill Murray is sublimly funny as usual.
133;Great addition to your video library .
134;The anniversary edition has a great """"making of"""" bonus that I have really enjoyed watching."""
135;OK, one extra down, two to go.
136;Truly incredible to compare the two performances which are roughly 3 years apart.
137;"2nd extra down, last one to go: ""The Making Of"" documentary."
138;"We learn that this movie is one of those amazing occurrances where the right creative team comes together
139;As the Director, Pollack supplied this excellent guidance, and rather than play the movie for bawdy laughter, he went for honesty and truth.
140;Bill Murray and Terri Garr gave many classic improv moments, and Jessica Lange gives a very sweet and honest """"straight"""" performance."""
141;Nice job and a move in the right direction, Columbia!
142;It is funny all the way through.
143;I think it is some of Hoffman's best work ever.
144;It's entertaining, educating, beautiful, funny love story.
145;This movie shows a lot of understanding for both gender, but especially for women.
146;The message that empathy can combine with sticking to your principles to create real power is timeless.
147;Worth watching ever year or so as a reminder.
148;One of the funniest movies ever made.
149;Moreover, the movie is far more than just funny .
150;it also explores very worthwhile aspects of gender politics and taboos, and the script is extremely well written and believable (there are no false lines).
151;In almost any other year, Hoffman would have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal, and the movie itself would have won the Best Picture Oscar.
152;also, one final correction to a previous review .
153;He and the rest of those responsible for this film are to be commended.
154;Was worried that it would seem a bit dated for them, but they loved it.
155;If you want really a good laugh, this is the movie.
156;Hoffman is so darn funny, and throw in Bill Murray, this movie is about an out of work actor, can't find a job, he dresses up like a woman and gets on a soap opera.
157;She fixes him up with her father, now this is hysterical, then on top of that one of the older male actors gets the hots for him.
158;There is so much more to this movie.
159;watched it and works just fine.
160;very happy with my order.
161;The superb acting of Dustin Hoffman and the hilarious lines turns this into a classic.
162;dustin hoffman shows his knack of being able to cover very well the broad spectrum of his acting abilities.
163;It was a close race for Dustin Hoffman, in 1982, when he was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, along with Ben Kingsley, for Ghandi.
164;This is a great, great film that I think is enjoyable on many levels.
165;Michaels is an outspoken, dowdy and very sassy middle aged woman who lands a major part on a daytime soap.
166;not only is the humor fast and furious, in this movie, but it is also a touching portrayal of a man best.
167;"He has to do some soul searching as to how he relates to women in the world, and the general attitude men in society have toward the ""weaker/second sex."
168;This is Dustin Hoffman's best movie.
169;This movie has been voted the one of the best comical films of all time!
170;Brief nudiety so beware if you have children with you when you watch!
171;This movie is funnier and more clever than when I saw it 25 years ago.
172;The ingenious story and directing and acting are more affirming than ever.
173;I thought Mrs Doubtfire was good but then i saw this and discovered Mrs Doubtfire was just repeating every comedic act from this movie.
174;dustin Hoffman was funnier at doing a lady's voice than Robin Williams.
175;this movie is still a must.
176;Even better than I remembered.
177;Jessica Lange was and shall always be a beauty.
178;Tootsie is one my all time favorite films.
179;It has one of the best actors of all times, Dustin Hoffman playing drag.
180;I think this is probably his best acting ever.
181;He is hilarious as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels.
182;He decides to dress in women's clothes and try to get a job as a woman.
183;He does a better job there!
184;dorothy/Michael takes things in stride and soons learns a great deal about himself and how he is with women.
185;This is one of the best comedies of all time.
186;The screenplay for this movie is awesome.
187;Hoffman gets some of the best lines ever heard on film.
188;Bill Murray gets a couple of good lines too.
189;He was very good in this movie.
190;Jessica Lange was outstanding, and very deservant of her Best supporting Actress award.
191;She was perfect in this film, not a single flaw.
192;The acting from everyone was just great.
193;When Dorothy decides to reveal the real truth on live t. v. is one of the best movie scenes of all time.
194;This whole movie is wonderful from start to finish, a truly great comedy that I think everyone should add to their video collection.
195;This is simply the best comedy of all time!
196;Dustin Hoffman is spectacular in this movie, why he didnt win an oscar I'll never know.
197;This is one of those movies when the script was right,they had the right cast,the right crew, everything.
198;I would recommend this movie to everybody!
199;Hoffman, as always, is a thrill to watch!
200;Jessica Lange, Terri Garr, Geena Davis and more make this film a total success!
201;The digital anamorphic picture is excellent as is the newly remastered Dolby digital 5:1 sound.
202;besides the excellent video and sound transfers .
203;I forgot what a great cast this movie has and it wasn't akward to watch with my teenage daughters.
204;This is a must have movie for comedy romance viewers.
205;This is a hilarious movie with intelligent dialogue and a great message.
206;Dustin Hoffman is brilliant and Bill Murray appears as Hoffman's roommate in one of his funniest and most underrated roles ever!
207;The special edition of Tootsie is great!
208;"I'm so glad there was an opportunity to conduct interviews with Sydney Pollack before passed away
209;The interviews with Dustin Hoffman are also hilarious and insightful.
210;At first it causes pain but ultimately honesty is the way to go.
211;This film was reminiscent of screwball comedies and it had some very hilarious moments.
212;The most important similarity though is that both films age pretty well and remains entertaining to this day although """"Victor/Victoria"""" in my opinion has the edge in terms of better aging and retention of entertainment value."""
213;"inducing which is why ""Tootsie"" is so good in that it is still able to retain much of its humour and entertainment value like all classic films should."
214;The scenes with Pollack and Hoffman I found to be the most entertaining and humourous and I was impressed at director Pollack's acting skills as I thought he was very, very funny in his role as Michael Dorsey's agent.
215;The cast in general was also very good which is not surprising when you have Bill Murray, Jessica Lange and Teri Garr on board.
216;Still an amusing and enjoyable film to watch.
217;mate played by Bill Murray, it would still be worth watching.
218;Add Dustin Hoffman's performance and Dave Grusin's terrific score and you can understand why this is such a true classic.
219;This is one of the best and funniest films ever made.
220;Everyone in this film is awesome!
221;And I do mean awesome!
222;It left me laughing and I can see why it was such a great hit.
223;This is classic comedy, well deserving of its status.
224;It's a gem and yes, Dustin Hoffman was robbed.
225;He should have had the Oscar for best actor.
226;This one of the best comedies ever made.
227;This is a classic movie, with Dustin Hoffman superbly playing the part of an out of work actor with a big ego.
228;it is a must for any collection.
229;Dustin Hoffman delivers an amazing dual performance as struggling actor Michael Dorsey, and his famous alter ego.
230;Bill Murray, Terry Garr, Jessica Lange, Dabney Coleman and Geena Davis lend a great supporting cast to this comedy classic.
231;Anyway, it's a funny film with great memories for me.
232;It was as funny for me today as it was when it first came out.
233;Really, what more do you need.
234;Throw in Bill Murray and get ready to laugh, a lot!
235;bender, role reversal flick will change the way you see the opposite sex.
236;"hysterically funny, but with a great romance and gender politics to boot
237;winning role) right down to George Gaynes and Bill Murray ( I wouldn't play hard to get. )
238;"
239;Lovely at the same time.
240;Probably the first movie that has a man impersonating a woman featuring Dustin Hoffman in the leading role in what can surely be claimed to be a classic that has spawned others like Mrs. Doubtfire.
241;i am definitely a fan of Hoffman's and this movie did very well for all concerned,i am forever grateful that he put away that dress and hairstyle having said that.
242;The story was fun, interesting and insightful.
243;Since this kind of misogynistic behavior continues today, this movie continues to be relevant.
244;Tootsie is one of those movies you watch and see something new in every time.
245;it is a great comedy.
246;This movie has perfect timing .
247;just that rhythm that makes you laugh.
248;Scene after scene just works.
249;Sidney Pollack, playing Michael Dorsey's agent while he directed, gets some amazing laughs.
250;The producer of the soap is great.
251;Somebody really cast this movie incredibly well.
252;Oh, and Teri Garr is perfect.
253;The whole premise is that Dustin Hoffman's actor is a self centered perfectionist, and that he figures a lot of things out (about women, about himself) while he's wearing his wig to make a buck.
254;cutting it short: Tootsie is the only romantic comedy I can think of that really deserved a Best Picture award.
255;This movie is still funny after all the years.
256;It is great to watch when you feel at all discouraged.
257;Although he has won plenty of acclaim.
258;Playing an actor (or actress!)
259;who is playing another role is never easy, yet he handles the multiple layers brilliantly.
260;The scenes between Hoffman and Sydney Pollack (who also directed) are the best part of the film, probably due in large part to their very real off.
261;This film also boasts the right amount of Bill Murray (not too much!)
262;Jessica Lange won Best Supporting Actress for what was in my opinion a fairly shallow role (Teri Garr deserved it more!)
263;This movie is one of the most fun cross dresser movies up there with Some Like it Hot , Victor/Victoria and Mrs Doubtfire .
264;surprising that Dustin Hoffman is not a totally unattractive woman.
265;Tootsie is still pertinent today and just as wonderful as it was all those years ago.
266;Watching this movie made me remember how the classic directors know how to tell a such a good story with such seemingly simple moves.
267;Show it to your children and they will laugh and then you'll all think about something really important.
268;How wonderful that a movie could be hysterical and groundbreaking!
269;Tootsie was one of the great movie gems of the 1980's.
270;Hoffman was great but I really like Bill Murray's role as his roommate.
271;It wasn't a big role but it was an excellent part.
272;It introduced a whole era of cross dressers.
273;Tootsie is a hysterical movie.
274;Tootsie is one of the best comedies ever made.
275;It is also extremely touching.
276;This new found romance awakens a new found sensitivity in Michael Dorsey.
277;Lange won a well deserved Academy Award for best supporting actress for this role.
278;Bill Murray, Teri Garr, and Sydney Pollack gave great performances as well.
279;concealed sexual identity and issues arising from it and give it a contemporary spin.
280;The film grabs you with its conceit and creates a laugh riot most of the time.
281;Unique, one of a kind comedy by an excellent director and cast!It stands alone in its class in humor and plot.
282;Dustin Hoffman made quite a transformation both physically and psychologically preparing for this role.
283;Getting a little dated but still great.
284;May be the best thing Hofffman ever did.
285;go, Hoffman's character challenges preconceived notions about gender roles and has an enlightening journey that teaches him about how to treat women.
286;it's funny, it's socially relevant, it's smart, and it's written with characters and dialog that feel real.
287;a trailer for the film.
288;One of the best films ever made?
289;"He very nearly steals the film!He's kind of a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action here and there, very wittily too I might add: ""You slut!"
290;It probably is the best film he has ever been in.
291;what I like most about this package is that theres an hour long Making of Tootsie.
292;But quite a lot of interesting stuff gets covered .
293;I know its a supporting character, and hes only in it here and there, but hes really quite wonderful.
294;You get the action of the film ending on a street with passers by, very rich detail.
295;The apartment kitchen is tiny, hardly a mirror to look at yourself into, wonderful improvised scene with Sandy there.
296;And Dabney Coleman plays a jerk so wonderfully!
297;But the story if affecting, the support work is wonderful.
298;the situations that Dorothy (Dustin Hoffman) face with the people she work with, marking her style, sudden improvisations and a strong an resoluted character under their surprise and admiration2.
299;the friendship between Dorothy and Julie, with the crossed feelings of a simulated woman and a real man that the first has3.
300;"while seeing tender images from Dorothy in and around Julie Nichols father's home we hear the touching song ""It May Be You""5."
301;the great end between ex.
302;the music while the train imageThis film and its soundtrack it's worth the money.
303;"I recommend also Dustin Hoffman's ""The Graduate,"" ""Midnight Cowboy"" (with its mythic soundtrack and Jon Voigt's first role and superb acting), ""Little Big Man"" and ""American Buffalo."""
304;Dustin Delivers a performance of a lifetime in this half.
305;farce that deserves its place in Cinmea's pantheon of Best Films of all Time.
306;Only Hoffman, doing what he does best .
307;force that also teaches us something about life in general.
308;Some of the sequences are phenomenally funny, while others fall flat, but Hoffman shines in every single frame.
309;Odd film but good acting.
310;"That's probably why ""Tootsie"" is the number two comedy of all."
311;dustin Hoffman turns in one of his best performances as a womanizing, self.
312;this is one of the first movie that demonstrated great acting to me.
313;Even Sydney Pollack's (the director himself) banters with Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels are remarkably funny, something that many other movies has imitated afterwards.
314;Strong script, great actors, fantastic direction, good song.
315;What a combination, but it worked.
316;Tootsie is an extremely funny, well.
317;made movie for ages 15 and up.
318;It is an inside look at acting and the acting market as well as a look at people and life itself.
319;"The acting and direction are top rate
320;It is funnier today as it was then.
321;The interviews, with Dustin Hoffman specifically, will offer insight into just how brilliant these professionals are.
322;It takes the piece to the highest level of creativity.
323;I really enjoyed this movie when it came out.
324;It is one of the best comedies of the 80's.
325;I thought my 23 year old son would enjoy this classic!
326;Each scene is very crafty and gives an amazing prospective to what getting a job based upon your looks really means to the entertainment industry.
327;One of my favorite Dustin Hoffman movies.
328;A great add to my collection.
329;Like """"Moonstruck"""", """"Some Like it Hot"""", and a very small handful of other rare gems in the comedy/satire genre, """"Tootsie"""" is a perfect movie from the first frame to the last."""
330;From concept to script to cast to production, the result is a flawless and often hilarious film that (like the aforementioned efforts) you will probably end up watching many times.
331;but he often gets it right, and in this instance got it sublimely right .
332;dustin Hoffman, in a brilliant and unforgettable performance, plays Michael Dorsey, the gifted but cranky and out.
333;His solution, revealed toward the end of the film, has become a classic scene.
334;The message and the narrative are seamlessly entwined.
335;a faultless supporting cast, headed by Bill Murray as Hoffman's playwright roommate, Teri Garr as Michael's despairing protegee, and Dabney Coleman as the obnoxious, chauvinist television director, make substantial contributions to the delightful experience that this movie is with performances that could have been two.
336;Funny and touching, this film deserved its nearly instantaneous rank as a classic.
337;This movie is a good one for those rainy Saturday nights when you have nothing to do and can curl up with someone you love and have a few good laughs.
338;I must be honest, I am not generally a Dustin Hoffman fan, but if I had to say, I'd rate this movie as one of his best.
339;There is some absolutely priceless interplay between the characters here.
340;This movie really makes one wonder what one values in a relationship .
341;, which contains a wonderful commentary track by Mr. Sydney Pollack.
342;tootsie, what a truly entertainment.
343;not only did Dustin Hoffman do a GREAT performance of being a WOMAN.
344;bill Murray, as Dustin's room mate in the story, he is so funny.
345;1982 saw the release of Tootsie, and luckily I got to see it in the theatre.
346;It is a hilarious tale of an actor donning drag to get a job , and learning some valuable lessons about life.
347;You can watch this with anybody.
348;This is another one from my era that I enjoy.
349;The cast is good and it makes me laugh throughout the movie.
350;I have enjoyed seeing this movie over and over.

354;Dustin, as always, is incredibly funny.
355;I love this movie because of the convincing and great acting by Dustin Hoffman, Terri Garr, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray.
356;After I ordered it from Amazon it came quickly and was very well priced.

358;Dustin Hoffman is hilarious as an actor doing what he needs to do to get the job and the girl.
359;glad its now in my library of best movies.
360;I love this movie, always have!
361;dustin plays Dorothy with such heart.
362;We worked our way through all 100 movies of the AFI top 100.
363;Hoffman is a brilliant but tempermental actor that nobody will work with any more.
364;In the movie, he pretty much talks to his agent (an equally brilliant Pollack), is told there's no work, and POOF the next morning he decides to be a middle.
365;the acting is brilliant here from all sides.
366;on with their emotions and relationships.
367;The dialogue is great as well.
368;It's a joy to watch.
369;It is staggering how rare a female.

376;If you like Mrs. Doubtfire, you'll love this movie!
377;have liked this since i first saw it .
378;It's a classic for good reason.
379;Clever writing, great acting, touching scenes.
380;Funny, yet doesn't seem like it's trying too hard for laughs unlike much of the poor, insipid screenplays out there.
381;Would of been 5 stars a few years ago, but it's still fun !
382;Jessica Lange is awesome as well.
383;The music score is awesome and it's fun to see bill murray
384;This is an excellent film.
385;It's been around nearly 20 years and what features do they give us for such a special movie and special performances??
386;In my opinion, special features move and talk.
387;I loved it ~ This is a great Anniversary Edition in addition to already being a great movie!
388;Love story with a cute twist.
389;Dustin Hoffman is so perfect for the part.
390;A great movie with a great cast.
391;Even 25 years later, the humor in Tootsie still manages to impress.
392;dressing movies is seriously mistaking.
393;With superb acting, hysterical script, and great direction Tootsie is the funniest movie ever created.
394;The timing Dustin Hoffman has makes the whole movie worth watching over and over and over again.
395;Dustin Hoffman is Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels in this classic comedy.
396;Everything from wedding proposals to falling in love with a female co. star on the show named Julie(Jessica Lang) Sydney Pollock directs and co. stars in this brilliant comedy the will have you laughing the whole time.
397;A defiant classic and must.
398;Jessica Lange is perfect as the beautiful soap actress and love interest.
399;Charles Durning is perfect as the sweet older man who falls in love with Dustin's Dorothy .
400;Bill Murray is great in his few scenes .
401;this is one of the first movies where we actually got to see him act .
402;Dabney Coleman is perfect as the arrogant director of the soap who cheats on poor Jessica.
403;Director Sydney Pollack wisely casts himself perfectly as Dustin's exasperated agent.
404;(The scene early on where he informs Dustin that NO ONE will hire him because he's too difficult is fantastic.)
405;Lastly, Dustin Hoffman is perfect as the actor who becomes a better man by pretending to be a woman.
406;just watch this movie .
407;up job is terrific and Dustin's so very real after his abrupt sex change .
408;It's great laughs and it's great entertainment for the whole family.
409;And: The fun doesn't wear off when watching this movie again.
410;and love it every single time!
411;A superlative example of how comedy can be successfully combined with warmth and pathos.
412;, and terrific comic gems, one of the best being when in an attempt to strengthen his soap opera character Hoffman spontaneously creates his/her own dialogue.
413;A classic in the sense of 'Some Like It Hot'.
414;I ordered it as a surprise for my mom and myself to watch.
415;It arrived timely and great shape Great film!
416;I finally got to see this movie.
417;it had great acting by all.
418;a must see for everyone.
419;This is such a wonderful movie.
420;dustin Hoffman is a terrific actor!
421;and Bill Murray is so hilarious.
422;Tootsie was monumental and new when it was first shown.
423;"In 1982, Dustin Hoffman played one of his most memorable roles as Michael Dorsey in the hilarious comedy, ""Tootsie""."
424;"with an excellent script, superb acting and a hilarious story, it was completely unsurprising that ""Tootsie"" earned 10 Oscar nominations, including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (Syndey Pollack), Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay."
425;Of all the Oscar nominations, only Jessica Lange won the Oscar.
426;Dustin Hoffman won the Golden Globe for Best Actor, as did Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress.
427;"if you enjoy films such as ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959) and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (1993), you will more than likely enjoy ""Tootsie"" equally as well."
428;It's a great commentary and spoof of soaps and acting classes and actors as well.
429;A really lovely romantic under.
430;I love how he grows and learns about himself and the opposite sex by becoming Dorothy.
431;Considered one of the funniest movies made, TOOTSIE after 20+ years still achieves that honor.
432;"Dustin Hoffman in a role that should have won him an Oscar is brilliant
433;His handling of the typical feminine prejudices is wonderful and his suffering in his longing for Jessica Lange (in a deserved supporting actress Oscar role) is touching.
434;All are matched perfectly to their roles, but ultimately it's Hoffman's show.
435;And it's a brilliant one!
436;Definitely just as entertaining today as it was years ago.
437;Had a very merry Christmas!
438;Dustin Hoffman and the outstanding cast are superb in this movie.
439;I will not give away the plot, but it is a great movie.
440;This cute movie is already a classic.
441;He does this so wonderfully that he becomes a star female actor almost overnight.
442;A series of humorous scenes as a result of this career change is a great treat for the viewer.
443;Dustin Hoffman shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all.

445;he plays his character very well.

454;it's pretty amazing how well this film works as both popcorn entertainment and as a feminist classic.
455;The comedy never lets up in """"Tootsie,"""" but Michael's (Dustin Hoffman's character) growing sympathy and understanding of what it's like to be a woman is always there."""
456;I was pretty surprised at how much this picture meant to Hoffman when he interviewed for it on CBS.
457;i don't want to ruin any jokes, so I'll just repeat that it's a very funny picture.
458;All the performances are excellent, especially Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange.

461;In a classic Say WHAAAA???!
462;He gets the part and now has steady work, but he becomes a phenomenon with the public.
463;There are so many screwball comedy antics and hilarious things going on you almost can't name them all.
464;Terri Garr has a nice role as his all of a sudden girlfriend (in one of the greatest recovery scenes ever when she catches him about to try on her dress), and Bill Murray, the only one who knows the secret, plays his typical exasperation and subtle humor that only he can deliver.
465;And the special features show Dustin Hoffman's transformation from a scary drag queen to a more believable one which is a must see as they test shots.
466;Have a good time with this.
467;It's simple yet so effective.
468;Tootsie is one of theose rare comedies that could have been slapstick about a man in drag, but turns out to be a genius comedy.
469;Insiteful and heartfelt as much as hilarious, Tootsie delivers on so many levels, the best comedies do.
470;Hoffman is so convincing in the title role, that you forget sometimes he isn't actual a woman.
471;the entire cast does an excellent job, especially Murray as Hoffman's room mate and the overlooked Charles Durning in an underappreciated role.
472;it will zap you in the pah.
473;the script is an absolute delight, and the acting is the best.
474;His portrayal of Dorothy Michaels is astounding.
475;he truly makes this somewhat dumpy middle.

477;"One of the most enjoyable films of the 1980's, ""Tootsie"" remains as good today as it was 20 years ago."
478;"While ""Ghandi"" was certainly a superb epic and probably deserved best picture, I will never understand how Ben Kingsley won for best actor over Hoffman."
479;a much greater challenge for an actor and frankly a performance more deserving of an Oscar.
480;One wonders who was sleeping with who to even consider Davis for the nomination.
481;This is a classic and great to chill out and watch on a rainy day.
482;Funny and sad at the same time.
483;Therein lays the strength of the movie: also in Dustin Hoffmans monumental performance playing it straight as it were .
484;Tootsie is so rife with moments of sheer comedic brilliance it catches the viewer almost by surprise.
485;What is quite miraculous about Tootsie especially for someone who has seen the movie now more than twenty times is Hoffmans ability to so completely immerse us in his character and his alter ego that somewhere along the way we can still forget this is Hoffman playing a part.
486;George Masters impressive makeup can only go so far.
487;"The rest of the assimilation from man into woman comes entirely from within Hoffmans ability to get inside Dorothy Michaels
488;Some thirty plus years after its debut, Tootsies social critique remains fresh and as plainly astute as ever.
489;It's as real and as perfect as movies get"
490;While some scenes look remarkably vibrant and exhibit very fine tonality, contrast and a good solid smattering of film grain, others appear with wan colors, heavy grain and even a visible age.
491;Tootsie is a seminal comedy to be enjoyed and reviewed over and over again.
492;This movie is always entertaining.
493;The bonus features on how the movie was made is very interesting.
494;I love this movie, Dustin Hoffman is a nut !
495;A story about friends keeping thing's from each other.
496;impressed me again with his excellent acting chops.
497;The story line was still fresh and the editing was wonderful.

499;Actors will especially appreciate it!
500;A movie that Is so refreshing to watch.
501;Dustin Hoffman, does such a wonderful job playing Tootsie.
502;You really come to enjoy the part of Tootsie and can understand why everyone really enjoys her.

514;He said to his wife that he had to play the part and she asked why.
515;He said because he would make an """"interesting looking"""" woman and he began to realize all of the wonderful women he never had a chance to know in his life because of their interesting appearances and just dismissing them, as Dorothy was dimissed."""
516;It is still as fresh and funny as the first time I saw it.
517;Marvelous performances by great actors (Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Sidney Pollack and others).
518;I have to say that this performance is one of Dustin Hoffman's best of his career.
519;He was absolutely outstanding .
520;This is still one of my all time favorite movies.
521;Dustin Hoffman's performance in the lead role is quite simply stunning and Jessica Lange has just the right touch of aloofness as a soap actor and love interest.

530;The rest of the supporting cast is quite good in the film especially Bill Murray as Michaels roommate Jeff and Teri Garr as a neurotic actress, Sandy.
531;The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Actor for Mr. Hoffman, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture and two Best Supporting Actresses, Ms. Garr and Ms. Lange, but Ms. Lange took home the films only Oscar.

539;Tootsie is a complicated film to say the least.
540;in the wrong hands, this could've played out like a daytime drama, but smart dialog, careful direction, and brilliant performances give the film a clever grace that raise it above the trappings of its plot.
541;great movies for a husband and wife to see,we loved it.

547;Under Pollack's direction, all of the cast members provide brilliant performances, notably Bill Murray as Michael's friend Jeff and George Gaynes as John Van Horn, another cast member.
548;Jessica Lange was selected to receive an Academy Award as best actress and deserved it.
549;Much of this film is hilarious, it is always entertaining, but as I indicated previously, having seen it again recently, I find it much bolder and more thought.

565;This movie also makes a heartfelt and delicate statement about the woman and man in all of us.
566;This is a classic movie, one to be cherished.
567;The movie was very comical.
568;I love Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray in this movie.

575;To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.
576;The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.
577;He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.
578;the characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.
579;The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.
580;i will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life.
581;aged actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is having great difficulty finding employment.
582;"material such as this has the potential to be treated in a lame or stupid way, but 'Tootsie' is a smart film
583;The humor is wonderful, oftentimes relying on subtle timing and inflections of tone, and the way the characters and story evolve is captivating.
584;She knows him as her matronly co. worker, and begins to lean upon him as a friend.
585;In his disguise of Dorothy Michaels, Michael Dorsey finds himself responding with genuine compassion and understanding to another person.
586;Dustin Hoffman plays his role with force, energy, conviction and humor.
587;Jessica Lange brings warmth and thoughtfulness to her character, and Bill Murray is a riot as the deadpan roommate.
588;The screenplay gives them intelligent things to talk about, and explores not only what it's like to be a struggling actor, but issues of personal identity and gender politics.
589;Tootsie is a clever, delightful and thoroughly enjoyable film.
590;What a tightly scripted, beautifully acted, finely paced comedy!
591;Throughout the film, there's always a pleasing sense of cynical humor (e. g., I dont believe in hell.
592;the from Morricone has a somewhat grating refrain of Stephen Bishop's It might be you but I guess it perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to the actor's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities .

594;at any rate, it's a great addition to any movie collection.

596;His success rate at both tasks is becoming evermore elusive and impossible.

601;If you love a good laugh w/ heart, this is a must.
602;I watch this every so often and it is just a joy.
603;I love movies about mistaken identity and similar themes.
604;It is always so hilarious to see the other characters' reactions when they find out the true identity of the central figure.

626;The first time I saw this, it was so good I wantwd to see it over and over!
627;I have loved this movie since it was out in the theaters.
628;I was really excited to get the anniversary edition.
629;I have always loved this movie and wanted to wait until I could get it for a good price!
630;(I've got to write 7 more words, and this should do it.)
631;It has always had a special place in my heart even after watching it many times.
632;A film this age is usually better sounding with a lossy sound decoder such as """"Multi Channel Stereo"""" or Dolby PL II."""
633;"Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor and in ""Tootsie"" he proves how versatile a performer he can be."
634;"In ""Tootise"" Dustin shows his comedic chomps and to this day his portrayal as a man who cross dresses as a woman to garner a role on a daytime soap is widely regarged by critics and fans as an intelligent and poignant performance."

636;Tootsie has found a niche for itself on the list of the best films ever, and upon its release became a huge boxoffice smash.
637;this new 25th Anniversary Edition features interviews, trailers, commentary, and more.
638;THis movie is one of the best of all time.
639;The acting was superb by the entire cast, especially Dustin Hoffman.
640;I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.
641;This is one of the best and funniest comedies of all time.
642;i've read the original script and it's brilliant.
643;Bill Murray gives the role some of the film's biggest laughs, but it's also fun to picture a droll, academic.
644;It was good to see Jessica Lange win the Best Supporting Oscar but DUSTIN HOFFMAN SHOULD HAVE WON FOR THIS MOVIE!
645;but TOOTSIE is the role where you see a master at work.
646;There are times I watch this movie simply to watch his expressions.
647;It's a part that works on numerous levels and Hoffman is funny on every one of them.
648;director Sydney Pollack not only flawlessly keeps the timing of the humor going, but he also contributes an authentic performance as Michael Dorsey.
649;Director's commentary, actor's commentary, even the writer's commentary.
650;all would be fascinating, I'm sure.
651;TOOTSIE is a smart, intelligent film about the roles and characteristics of men and women.
652;Lots of good humor mixed with excellent acting and important messages to consider about societal roles and living a meaningful life.
653;This movies is just as good as it was years ago on the big screen.
654;We has so much fun watching it again and laughter our heads off.
655;This movie is one of the best movies ever made.
656;The plot is as good as any plot ever written and the cast gives one of the best performances in Hollywood history.
657;one of the most famous in modern movie history.
658;Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity.
659;Dustin Hoffman is pure genius in this movie.
660;Tootsie is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men.
661;The editing is particularly crisp, often adding a comic punctuation of its own.
662;As the film's director, his principle duty is to make sure that the film coheres into a logical narrative.
663;Similarly, as Dorsey's agent, he provides a lot of that necessary narration.
664;Not only does he direct with great comic assuredness, his character crucially makes Dorsey's madness believable.
665;It's incredible to me that such a seminal work can be so bereft of even a simple director's commentary.
666;He even has a man want to date him as the woman
667;Dustin Hoffman is a fantastic character actor, one of the all time greats.
668;He is superb in this movie.
669;The cast thinks he is a woman and it really was funny watching Hoffman try to keep them from learning he was a man.
670;This movie was really funny and yet it had a lot of drama and humanity included.
671;i found his portrayal of a woman more interesting and likable than that of the male character, in fact, there were times that I would get so wrapped up in the character, Dorothy, that I would forget that he was a man acting as a woman.
672;The cast, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, Charles Durney, Geena Davis, were all great.
673;this is one of those movies that will be remembered for years to come!
