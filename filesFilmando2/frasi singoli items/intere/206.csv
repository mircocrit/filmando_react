1;He directs, writes, and acts as the film's main protagonist in Garden State, a film with flashes of near brilliance.
2;He is no doubt worth looking out for and deserves quite a bit of credit.
3;He meets old friends and reflects on his family life before he left his hometown.
4;He then meets a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman) who helps him realize what is really important to him.
5;Performances from Portman, Braff, Ian Holm, Peter Saargard and others are genuine, at times amusing, and overall pretty solid.
6;Portman is especially enjoyable to watch but you really wonder how long she can be the potentially great actress everyone has been waiting for.
7;Anyway, it is worth watching if you like the talent in this movie.
8;It shows some budding talent from Braff and some solid actors at work.
9;It also happens to have a smart sense of humor that I suppose I appreciated.
10;Thesoundtrackwas great but also felt pretty consistent with Braff's hipster.
11;teenager affair a la Mrs. Robinson, a couple of surreal airport visits, and.
12;Back in Jersey, he meets up with some of his quirky stay.
13;"cute encounter at the neurologist's office with the quirky Sam (Natalie Portman, with Spock ears intact, a bit of Naboo still in her eyes, and a sign on her forehead reading ""I'm seriously nuts"") introduces Andrew to the kind of family he wishes he had."
14;"warm, loving, lots of hugs, adopted African student (making ""Garden State"" the second movie in very recent memory."
15;to establish a family's big heartedness by plunking an African adoptee into the middle of the love.
16;In Sam, Andrew's finally found the kind of girl who's bound to change his life forever if only he'll let her inside the walled garden (get the double.
17;Lots of fun follows as Andrew introduces Sam to his shifty pals, but before you know it, Andrew's four.
18;i think this movie won some kind of big award at The Sundance Festival.
19;This is a hidden gem.
20;A great movie that was never publized.
21;Easily worth the price of admission.
22;This is a fine example of what can be done outside the studio system.
23;Recipe for a great movie.
24;Funny in a subtle way with a cast that is top notch.
25;I work in a similar field so the take on this was interesting.
26;Scrubs was very good and now over.
27;Sarsgaard's semi dark role was spot on.
28;Dude in the suit of armor was surreal.
29;soundtrack is a real plus.
30;Very good and integrated well.
31;this is on my favorite list for sure.
32;Zach Braff is an amazing actor and his writing and directing here are almost perfect.
33;She was adorable and well.
34;It addresses the concerns I seem to recall having as a teenager, it handles everything very well, and I laughed more than once.
35;Yep, I can certainly see it being beloved by some teens.
36;I saw some bits that were very effective, and some humor that worked quite well.
37;so yeah, a fine movie, and I'm not even in its demographic.
38;This is a dark romantic comedy.
39;This is a great film.
40;Zach Braff wrote this film very well.
41;He also directed this movie well.
42;Natalie portman did a brilliant job.
43;She really changed her personality for this film.
44;Also, Method man is in this film and also did a good job, even though he was there for like 5 minutes.
45;Garden State may resonate with older classic films like The Graduate, or more recent ones like Beautiful Girls, but the film still manages to carve out its own beautiful identity through wonderful characters, rich performances, and the meticulous, careful eye of its writer and director Zach Braff.
46;"It was also impressive enough to snag Braff The national Board of Review's award for this year's best debut by a director.You may know Braff as the wacky Dr. John ""J. d."" Dorian on the excellent sitcom Scrubs on NBC."
47;Though in Garden State, Braff does a complete 180 turn on screen and behind the lens, taking us on a journey of rediscovery, redemption, and love.
48;"Don't fear
49;connecting with the familiar places and people of his past, and is ultimately transformed by Sam, a free.
50;spirited, Shins loving pathological liar wannabe, played by a wonderfully funny and touching Natalie Portman, who steals almost every scene she's in.
51;She accompanies Andrew throughout his visit home, and ends convincing him that life and love do indeed exist after Zoloft.
52;garden State is further enhanced by great supporting performances by a superb Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Andrew's childhood friend and companion throughout most of the film.
53;The film is also rich with small, quirky performances by all the people from Andrew's past.
54;All of that, partnered with a truly awesome soundtrack featuring the likes of the aforementioned Shins, Nike Drake, and Simon and Garfunkle, make for a long.
55;It's a small film with a huge heart, and one of the best films of the year.
56;Zach Braff's directorial debut has similarities to the groundbreaking, timeless film """"The Graduate""""."""
57;There is an almost immediate sense that these two are soulmates .
58;that they can laugh together and cry together.
59;I especially loved the scene where the three main characters (Peter Sarsgaard is the third main character) visit a couple and their baby in an old ark.
60;like boat located next to a natural wonder, a very deep chasm.
61;, conveying that Andrew is in the process of discovering his own true nature and path in life.
62;When Andrew impulsively kisses Sam, it seems moving,real and tender .
63;one of the few truly romantic screen moments that you want to relive over and over .
64;This entire scene is perfect.
65;The music helped create the mood.
66;With a few rare exceptions, every character in the film sounds like every other character.
67;You could take any line spoken by a character, and give it to almost any of the other characters and it wouldn't sound out of place.
68;One of those that was good to see the once.
69;Best soundtrack of all time.
70;The movie is pretty cool, too!
71;I know there are people out there that say this movie isn't satisfying or whatever but I honestly feel that you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy Garden State.
72;I just love it and there's something indescribable about it that I love.
73;This movie is a bit interesting in that it's sort of quirky.
74;A couple of scenes in the movie have a somewhat surreal tone to them either because of the backdrop of because of what happens in them.
75;In the end, most of the characters seem likable, even a few who appear to be unsavory at first.
76;This is an amazing movie that is easily worth $5.
77;The soundtrack is also top.
78;This created an opening to Andrew's eyes and mind.
79;This small breach leaked out light to Andrew's gray character.
80;All his feelings that were bottled up from his youthful past finally spilled out before him and to people he loved.
81;it is worthwhile to see how Sam and Andrew help each other out healing each other, and learning life's most important purpose.
82;This movie was worth its time and I'd recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are seeking a possible meaning to Life.
83;As a sidestep, the acting surprised me in a good way, and the cinematography was slightly better than your average film.
84;"Garden State is just a great movie
85;I know several people similar to Mark, played by Peter Sarsgaard, and have met a few cool yet kind of strange girls such as Sam, played by Natalie Portman.
86;The movie does a fine job of combining drama, comedy, and romance without going too over the top.
87;talented man and he really shines here.
88;zach Braff stars and directs this almost charming film about an actor who has numbed his mind in various ways to block out some a tragic point in his life.
89;well as the relationship grows Braff finds himself beginning to deal with himself and touch on his repressed feelings.
90;in the end he does and the pair both find comfort in eachother.
91;it's definately worth seeing once for sure because it deals with how human beings can put repress their true heart on a dime if it suits them.
92;so watch this and follow it with something more comedic.
93;Garden State is such a great movie on so many levels.
94;It has its moments where it is funny, sweet, and sad yet is done in such a way that it flows very well.
95;actor Zach Braff does a good job of capturing moments in these peoples lives that have a heartfelt and lasting impact long after the movie is over.
96;Braff used a great selection of mostly indie bands including coldplay, the shins, nick drake, and an excellent cover of 'Such Great Hights' by Iron and Wine.
97;Continuing on in my `all things Sarsgaard' I'm actually getting to one of his greatest performances"
98;"I enjoy the film, and I remember when it came out I actually loved it and found it an amalgam of jovial fun
99;It remains one of those clever films that, over time, proves itself less clever and more pretentious and even superficial.
100;In fact, to be honest, the acting in this film is rather remarkable from all parties.
101;He was so focused on creating a visually appealing film complete with `hip' music and clever tricks that he lost focus on creating a moving STORY.
102;I do wholly believe that some of the best films are built around beautifully constructed sequences of memorable events, even if those events are mere images that burrow themselves in our mind and keep us in rapt attention, but where `Garden State' fails to live up is in the area of cementing those `sequences' with heartfelt purpose.
103;like I said, the acting is sublime.
104;Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar this year for her work in `Closer'.
105;She is stunning here as the hyper Sam, an intriguing character with flaws and demons of her own.
106;He steals every scene he is in and just proves that a great performance can help carry a rather shallow film.
107;so, I can understand the draw for this film, but I strongly feel that the love for it is blind.
108;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
109;the music, the mood of the entire movie, the humor, it all works beautifully.
110;Zach Braff did a wonderful job with this picture.
111;He wrote, directed, and starred in this and that is an amazing accomplishment, especially when the outcome is a film as beautiful as this is.
112;I don't normally watch a lot of independent comedy/dramas, but I love Garden State.
113;There's something about the film that's not too pretentious and I feel like everyone can relate in some way to the characters.
114;I recommend it for fans of The Royal Tenenbaums and 500 Days of Summer.
115;But it does to speak to many 20 something year olds.
116;Many of us have felt that, especially after we are done with college and try to find a job we'll like.
117;Every 20 something has the dream of meeting that special someone"
118;Yes, it's our fantasy that gets played out in this film, and many older folks will fail to see it, and just think of it as a cop.
119;"For many 20 somethings, we are still looking for our own family and home, as the moving quote from the movies goes ""maybe family is just a bunch of people who miss the same imaginary place."
120;A differnt movie for sure.
121;Natalie Portman is brilliant I have to say.
122;It's very easy to empathize with the quirky characters, and see a little bit of yourself in each of them.
123;It reminded me how beautiful imperfection is.
124;"I know people who didn't like this movie because they didn't find an obvious plot, or because they thought it was ""weird,"" but I think their criticisms really get to the heart of what makes Garden State so special."
125;This is delightful film about character.
126;"garden State is not perfect
127;if you are a soul that feels a bit awkward, that never really completely fit in, but find beauty in the dissonance/melancholy of life, and yet still have hope . . . this movie can be a great travel companion down that uncertain path of life.
128;A wonderful film, very philosophical and heartfelt, a rare film that really explores human emotions and the anxieties of a college grad in an entertaining way
129;I've heard so many great reviews and I wanted to likee this movie.
130;It seems that every few years, somebody has to make an independent, critically acclaimed version of that classic, Dante's Inferno.
131;This is one """"Inferno"""" that took me by surprise."""
132;Sam is openly flawed, funny and compassionate.
133;She challenges him to look for truth in everything, even his pain.
134;It is a turning point that leads to important revelations.
135;i loved the way this film was written and paced so that Andrew's feelings of being lost and confused are infectious to me, the audience, yet it never becomes morose or dark.
136;This same slowness did work against it at times, but there are also some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely touching scenes.
137;Overall though, Garden State was a well.
138;crafted offering for the cult.
139;Generally recommended for generations Y, X and Portman fans.
140;First and foremost, a little bit about myself.
141;The cover graphic didn't suggest anything of great interest, but the word of mouth was pretty good.
142;The film was great and had to be watched multiple times.
143;what makes this movie so unique is the richness of the characters, the development of the plot, and the geniune emotions that are evoked.
144;The humor is not overwhelming, but very tactful and sometimes hidden, making for a much more authentic emotion.
145;the soundtrack to the film is great, .
146;"every single song is nice to listen to, especially the Coldplay's opening credits, and the ""Let Go"" of the end credits."
147;i DO NOT recommend Garden State.
148;"The soundtrack is excellent
149;I would recommend this film.
150;Hey, I admit, I really enjoyed this movie too, but I think that we can all relate when it comes to holding unrealistic expectations for a movie because others built it up so much.
151;Best party scene in a movie, ever made for 30something's.
152;One of my favorite actors.
153;Lots of laughs,and great feel good movie, enjoy!!!!
154;of girlfriend at the time suggested we watch it I said ok just to be nice to her.
155;I was pleasantly suprised when i Really, really really liked the movie.
156;The story isn't anything overly exciting, but it is quirky and charming, as are all of the characters in their own unique way.
157;This movie is quite funny at times, although not a comedy.
158;The dialogue is constantly amusing, and I feel like i could relate to a lot of the characters and events that occured iwthin it.
159;The love story is reflective to a lot of things that have happened in my life.
160;I know what its like to be leaving your loved one at the airport never expecting to see them again.
161;I woulnd't say this is the best movie i've ever seen but I definitley thouroughly enjoyed it and would rank it 9/10.
162;I would recommend it to all, because i believe almost everyone could sit down and watch this movie and truly enjoy it.
163;The ending scene is beautiful, and the main characters find what I think we are all looking for in life: Love.
164;this was quite possibly one of the funniest movies that i have ever seen.
165;From the initial meeting of Portman and Braff up to the very last scene, every moment is authentic and true.
166;for a director, Braff's acting is quite good but few actresses are capable of putting forth a performance like Natalie Portman.
167;She is utterly amazing and by far the most compelling character in the movie.
168;Portman is an idealization of the pleasant, playful, penetrating coquette we've all read about but rarely meet.
169;Frankly, it's a joy to have her on the screen.
170;garden State is a movie about love, friendship, life, and family and its effect is total gratification.
171;oh I loved the music and wasn't the movie just darling.
172;ridden notebook actually are funny and clever.
173;Ultra hip is what this is.
174;Oh and the """"near the end"""" scene where main characters get up on the caterpillar rig (or whatever it was) and yell and scream: god that was touching."""
175;Showgirls did as good of a job as this movie did.
176;That movie won a rasperry award and so should have this.
177;But hey there was some good music in the movie, so I better give it 5 stars (the Shins are good, but if they are life changing then my whole review must be retracted and I will bow down naked to the indie rock god Zack Braff).
178;I truly enjoyed this movie.
179;I even bought it, and watched it a few more times.
180;the one thing I thoroughly enjoyed was how you noticed his attitude about life changed.
181;Towards the end he was smiling and enjoying, and BEING in the moment.
182;Every so often there are films that come along and are able to elicit very strong emotional reactions from viewers based on specific scenes or characters that can be related to.
183;This movie came out of nowhere and gobsmacked audiences with it's raw tenderness and sincerity.
184;While hom, he has a chance meeting with a girl who embodies an energy and spirit that is something that he hadn't realized had been missing from his life, and everything in his life is turned upside down.
185;Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and Natalie Portman offer excellent supporting performances as characters that go beyond the typical cookie.
186;Despite being genuinely touching, the movie has great elements of humor and clever wit as well.
187;Much like The Breakfast Club and Reality Bites before it, Garden State is a great representative film for it's generation and will doubtlessly become a classic.
188;It is one of those rare movies that you just can't quite get out of your head after you see it for the first time, whether you relate to it personally or not.
189;My teenage son recommended I watch Garden State, so I watched it, and I've watched it again, and it continues to grow on me.
190;Little things have stayed with me about GS, including the powerful soundtrack.
191;natalie Portman was born to play the female lead.
192;The humor was fantastic, and I understand, alot of the material was autobiographical.
193;Somehow, this is all forgiven, given the otherwise sincerely of the script.
194;The good include meeting up with old friends and meeting Natalie Portman.
195;It's one of those films that will either bore you to death, or you will enjoy every moment.
196;Best to just watch it with an open mind.
197;There are plenty of comedy moments as well as sad ones.
198;The soundtrack is excellent (if you like Chillout music like Zero 7) and there are plenty of slow motion effects (to music).
199;all in all Garden State is a nice chillout film that is like eating a bowl of Ready Brek.
200;Watch it, and then get up and glow.
201;Holy cow, this movie is a breathe of fresh air.
202;If the movie is good, then it's good.
203;It's a very paced, clever, funny and emotional experience.
204;There it is, pretty simple right?
205;Well, yeah, it is simple.
206;His connections with them are very ture.
207;the gorgeous Natalie Portman joins in after a little while and the story really takes off.
208;I'll just say that my favorite parts were the Mideval Times, and the bow and arrow scenes.
209;There is a decent amount of swearing and some drug use, but it's all done with class.
210;This is a great movie for when you're feeling down or lost.
211;It's a strange and wonderful movie.
212;I think Firedancer's review hit it right on the nail.
213;I thought this was going to be great with everything positive that I heard.
214;well put together ,perfect cast.
215;i think he did a fantastic job.
216;This movie is sooooo good!
217;i mean i will admit it is kinda a common indie film plot (commin of age) but wow i thinks it stands above the rest it funny and insightfull.
218;and i honestly beleive he is one of the most taltented actors out there.
219;the story is unique, and I really felt that I understood the main character.
220;zack Braff and Natalie Portman performed well as usual, and their romance was sweet.
221;i also liked the Peter Sarsgaard character: offbeat, edgy, with attitude.
222;Although I give this film 4 stars I was dissappointed in a lot of it.
223;I got this thinking that Zach's style and humor from Scrubs might be fun to see in a film.
224;if you love Scrubs (good family humor) and you are looking to find that here, keep looking.
225;Garden state is an excellent heartwarming film.
226;Zach Braff and Natalie Portman's performances are superb.
227;The cinematography and directing are excellent.
228;The soundtrack is also great (Academy Award Winner for Best Soundtrack).
229;It's a movie that should be viewed more than once to truly appreciate it.
230;I watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.
231;It's a little quirky, but I like quirky.
232;He constantly shows on there what a good actor he is.
233;With his movie Garden State he shows us what a great director and writer he is.
234;I especially liked the writing in this.
235;There's a lot of very clever stuff in this movie.
236;She's VERY likeable in her role.
237;Her and Braff have great chemistry together.
238;it's a really good movie with a nice mix of drama and comedy.
239;Best of all, it left me feeling good at the end of it.
240;Zach Braff is amazing in this movie.
241;Great story of finding ones self and falling in love.
242;Portman is excellent as always, Zach Braff has made me definitely want to see him again and the rest of the supporting actors were cast perfectly.
243;I am not going to get into the storyline since it has been thoroughly explained previously, but Garden State is worth owning.
244;Many of the reviews give it a thumbs up.
245;garden State is a great movie.
246;The part that makes this movie stand out so much to me is the feeling of REAL that is in it and the rich performances from the actors in the film.
247;Give it a shot .
248;not your typical blockbuster romantic comedy, but a smart and thoughtful look at life.
249;i love the way it doesnt explain things right away.
250;brilliant work by zach braff, genius.
251;i look forward to his next project.
252;It's a cute movie (and great soundtrack).
253;"There is a bit of a ""Hollywood"" ending."
254;when I saw it i was very impressed.
255;I thought the movie was very well made and very entertaining.
256;Seeing Natalie Portman helped a lot.
257;this has been my favorite movie so far to come out in months.
258;If you loved the movie you are going to love the soundtrack.
259;Both are great and both I bought.
260;Garden State is the eccentric journey of a 26 year old back to his hometown.
261;His realization is sparked by the inquisitive Natalie Portman, whose happy go lucky nature is coupled with her kind spirit, as is demonstrated by her affection for her many house pets.
262;The characters, their histories, and their fragile emotions blend well into an interesting and engaging plot.
263;Portman helps to catalyze his return to the emotional with her bright smile and their feelings for each other.
264;braff finally starts to move into the future by sharing his poignant memories of the past.
265;On his last day in the Garden State, he finally realizes that the destination is not all that important, it's the journey that matters most.
266;I enjoyed it and thought it was very well made, especially for a first time write and director.
267;There are some very funny moments but it is not hilarious as I've seen some reviewers say.
268;It is a very good character piece that is quirky and odd but not too much so that it turns you off.
269;I liked the way the romance was underplayed and yet was integral in Braff's character beginning to come to terms with things in his life.
270;I thought Portman was great in this movie, although the character could be slightly annoying.
271;overall, Garden State is funny, but not hilarious.
272;It's very well done, if a little too slow in pace at times.
273;Easily my favouite film from the last year, this film by Zach Braff succeeds completely on it's own terms.
274;By turns it is wholly engaging, hilarious, sad, touching and profound.
275;natalie Portman plays her very best role here, in fact the entire cast seem to completely understand Braff's universe and relish his attraction to faulted but ultimately endearing characters.
276;just a willingness to understand the chaos that makes people what they are.
277;i recommend this film to literally anyone .
278;the soundtrack is perfectly married to the film (one of the best in years) and while the aesthetic is that of a quaint indie production it cuts through to anyone with a heart and a sense of humour.
279;This is a very mellow movie, don't expect action in any way.
280;Braff's adventure in seeking the town he is from and his relationship with his father is remarkable.
281;Meanwhile, Andrew's father (Ian Holm) wonders what happened to the happy son he had, but Andrew wonders where his father got the idea that he was happy once.
282;director Zach Braff has crafted an excellent film that I think perfectly captures the feelings of restless youth.
283;Nothing can be done fast enough for us.
284;Can't wait to be rich and famous.
285;the performances, in my opinion, are brilliant, in that they are subtly nuanced.
286;braff has a bright future ahead of him if he continues to make films.
287;He is able to shift between comedy and poignancy at the drop of a dime, and doesn't cheat to get the desired effect.
288;My husband and I love love love this movie!!!
289;We also love love love the sound track. . . .
290;which we have and listen to it quite often!
291;A beautiful little love story . . . . .
292;"The set of deleted/shortened scenes was extensive
293;He was medicated his whole life, then he came off.
294;I often talk about films with simple but altogether moving stories, like The Breakfast Club and Adventureland.
295;This is one of the finest first features from any director since Sam Mendes' American Beauty.
296;thou girl(but one with a true soul that's uncovered not.
297;She is MUCH more than a """"love interest""""."""
298;"this film is truly about renewed life
299;That last message should be enough to warrant that you see this film if you haven't"
300;The characters compliment each other and the new romance that blooms slowly between the leads is delicate and sweet not forced and overpowering as many movies thrust at you.
301;Definately a movie you will come away from with a sense of self and growth.
302;I'm a 25 year old male and I love this film.
303;very touching, funny and sweet.
304;i'm learning to respect Portman more as an actress.
305;She keeps Sam's quirkiness believable, even saving some dialog that's a bit clumsy and melodramatic by making it part of her melodramitic, clumsy, and insecure character.
306;I love Kevin Smith movies .
307;and the MUSIC is GREAT!
308;This is a perfectly good student film.
309;I see movieslike this getting five stars .
310;This is one of my very favorite movies.
311;I am dissatisfied with this product, and the service at this point in time.
312;If I hear from the seller about returning or exchanging the item, I will definitely update my opinion.
313;Zach Braff's directorial debut, Garden State, is the essence of an independent film.
314;there is an audio commentary by Braff and Portman that is quite engaging and personable.
315;The Making of Garden State examines how Braff put his movie together.
316;There is quite a bit of decent behind.
317;For a Making Of featurette it is refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie that always pad out the running time of these things.
318;there is also a fairly amusing collection of blown lines and bloopers.
319;garden State is a film bursting with ideas, keen observations on life and memorable images that make most other films look inert by comparison.
320;A surprising winner in my book, Garden State is entirely likable, and also one of those films that is capable of being simultaneously deep and funny, light and fun, welcoming and imposing, all as it slips out from behind its misguiding exterior and brutally confides things to us we'd almost as soon not know.
321;Writer Zach Braff of NBC's Scrubs was equally great as director and actor, playing the part of a young man named Andrew Largeman, who has returned to New Jersey after nine years of living in California, where he has won moderate fame on a TV series playing an intellectually.
322;"handed compliment in the movie has someone telling Andrew, ""On that show I really thought you WERE retarded."")"
323;Above all else Andrew unexpectedly finds love, and it is the story of this love that gives (the almost dreary) Garden State its well.
324;"Andrew and Sam are the sort of people it's impossible not to root for, and the entire film has a ""what will happen next"" feel that's rarer than ever for any writer to accomplish."
325;I love movies like this, movies that may not have much in the plot area but more in the mental area, making you think about life and the mundane things that can take over.
326;WHile he's in town he hangs out with friends (Sasgard) and Sam (Portman in an amazing role for her!)
327;i thought that it was a great, coming of age film and is worth a watch by anyone interested in exploring the reality that is life, no matter how boring you find yours to be.
328;That said, it's a pretty pleasant viewing experience until about 15 minutes from the end, when a son.
329;I was genuinely surprised by Zach Braff's _Garden State_.
330;I found myself laughing my ass off at a few lines in particular and thought the entire movie was delivered with a nice touch of humor.
331;Moreover, it is a comedy in the sense of the overall arch of the main character.
332;it is a bit of a dark comedy about reconnecting with the world again.
333;there are a few scenes in this film that are superbly well done, parts where the script connects with the audience and everything comes together.
334;With wonderful acting, a great oddball script and premise, and what is quickly becoming acknowledge a stellar soundtrack, _Garden State_ delivers exactly what it promised and much, much more.
335;It was nice to see a movie that didn't depend on special effects and technology.
336;The relationship between the main characters was really genuine and they didn't hop into bed first thing and that was a plus.
337;I would recommend the movie to most anyone.
338;Zach Braff puts forth a noble effort in his writing/directorial debut.
339;beyond the plot weakness, Braff does a good job of acting the emotionally numb lead role while Natalie Portman (whose previous acting I don't care for) gives her best performances to date in the supporting role.
340;Somehow, a romance seems to bring them together and balance them out a bit before the story ends.
341;There's also some interesting but subtle commentary and insight which illustrates the potential overuse and mis.
342;the cinematography, visual imagery and soundtrack also do a good job of keeping this movie slightly above average.
343;The soundtrack featuring Coldplay and The Shins does an excellent job at capturing the mood of the generation.
344;Many generation x'ers seem to have enjoyed the soundtrack more than the film itself.
345;the documentary about the making of the film is also worth watching.
346;"writer Zach Baff's ""Garden State"" is a consistently engaging film although not a perfect one."
347;The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced.
348;The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship.
349;Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy.
350;In smaller roles some older actors shine: Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother.
351;who really deserves 5 stars, the performance is that radiant, fresh and heartfelt.
352;What a difference a director makes!
353;The ending was consistent with the storyline.
354;"top dramatic second half of the movie because I was rolling my eyes so much (case in point: ""Hey, good luck exploring the infinite abyss.
355;Oh, those young people, with their kissing.)
356;Ray is coming of age, and through Ray we explore universal 'coming of age' crises and conflicts.
357;Little wonder that the stress of Ray's constant soul.
358;again, a universal rite of passage into adulthood.
359;Hey, that's a new one!
360;kooky, unpredictable woman gets a repressed guy to open up and show his emotions and even cry!
361;Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time!
362;It's nice to know that she got such a fun role after (before?)
363;The whole film has a grittier feel than """"Spanglish"""", which helped make it more to my taste."""
364;The movie also has an interesting mental health aspect at its core and should appeal to those who've lived with someone who's under a psychiatrist's care.
365;I loved this movie, mostly because it wasn't a polished pop.
366;tart package but, rather, a portrait of where I found myself in life on the day of its release.
367;zach Braff is a genius, and he's pretty hot, too.
368;He plays the role of Large superbly .
369;on the silver screen, you look into his eyes and just see his confusion and apathy and yet his spark that keeps him going.
370;He is talented and charming.
371;I was extremely excited to see his debut as both a writer and producer.
372;i found the majority of the films quirkiness to be refreshing.
373;Braff's personality and humor really shined through and provided much needed comic relief.
374;It takes a very special talent to both star and direct a film, especially one attempting to challenge human emotion paradigms.
375;Hopefully he has learned from his rookie mistakes and will turn out a more even and compelling film the next go.
376;This movie is, hands down, the best director.
377;debut film I've seen in the past 5 years, and one of the best movies I've seen in my life (reguardless of how experienced the director is).
378;the visuals are beautiful without being overbearing.
379;The dialogue is funny and realistic without being stylized.
380;The characters feel like the people you grew up with.
381;The girl is what every guy wants: cute beyond words, funny, friendly, and amazing in an indescribable way.
382;well, the music quite possibly makes up the best soundtrack of preexisting songs that has ever been assembled for a motion picture.
383;there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film.
384;Garden State won't cheat you, it's interestingly creative, genuinely sweet and beautiful without having to be set in nazi Germany.
385;If the critics say this is a great movie, maybe it's because they do that for a living.
386;This Movie is truly beautiful.
387;Making her character so believable.
388;If you're a fan of 500 Days Of Summer, Moulin Rouge, and Juno, you'll love this movie.
389;I love Zach Braff's character on Scrubs and was suprised to read that he wrote and directed this.
390;very impressive characters, great acting and a nice story line.
391;i'm not really great on giving reviews on serious independent movies so I won't bore you but this was a great movie.
392;The same can be said for Portman's character, she is sweet and fun but ultimately unbelievable.
393;This is a triumph for Zach Braff who directed, wrote, and also stars as Andrew Largeman who finds that love beats the holy heck out of lithium and assorted drugs bizarrely prescribed by his unfeeling father who just happens to be a shrink.
394;Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked.
395;She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power.
396;with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world.
397;Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.
398;the movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear.
399;More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist.
400;And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track.
401;see this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received.
402;This movie expresses how some teenagers/young adults, the few among the many may find peace and happiness among each other, finding a right path as the few who DO end up find regardless of the extent of their emotional struggle ( Andrew's family issues ).
403;It's witty, charming and not preachy.
404;It truly is that clear cut.
405;With Garden State, he accomplishes a lot.
406;He writes, directs, and stars in his own first feature.
407;And he gets to show people what great musical taste he has.
408;There are lots of musical interludes that don't advance the story.
409;Signal strength was very good, so I started watching.
410;All was well until about 10.15 minutes into the movie, the picture froze.
411;He is certainly a game changer, I can't wait for his Kickstarter.
412;I really enjoyed this movie.
413;This movie is like pure water in that it is honest, honest, honest.
414;"It is a great ""movie."""
415;But this film, it embraces the fact that it's a film and can show something in a certain way.
416;in doing so, it comes across as a movie close to what real life is and sounds like.
417;And did I mention the dialog!
418;The way characters sometimes talk in this film makes you laugh at the true sincerity.
419;There are a lot of wryly funny jokes.
420;Several good and interesting songs can be heard in the movie.
421;There are many memorable scenes and images in the movie .
422;The chemistry that should have developed between her and Braff just fizzled.
423;"I still thought ""Garden State"" was worth seeing, worth hearing, and worth thinking about afterwards."
424;This is truly a movie for everyone.
425;We both thought it was incredible.
426;It is rare that a movie can make you think.
427;This movie did so beautifully.
428;I highly recommend this movie.
429;One of the best I have ever seen.
430;This movie was as funny as re.
431;I cant believe so many people liked this movie.
432;The story itself was interesting and the characters were fantastic.
433;Yes, I laughed a few times.
434;Maybe if you are someone who is looking for the meaning of life, this is a good movie.
435;Mostly, I want to laugh and enjoy the movie.
436;Cliched metaphors are shoved in the viewers face throughout the film.
437;the film moves fluidly between humor and pathos, and fortunately Braff knows when to avoid making the story more heavy.
438;And the alternative rock soundtrack, while terrifically evocative, also creates that aura of creeping irrelevance.
439;But Braff is smart enough to know to focus primarily on his characters, and that's the film's saving grace and greatest strength.
440;strumming Mark, Peter Sarsgaard proves again what a fiercely intelligent and versatile actor he is.
441;Jean Smart has a funny cameo as Mark's blowsy mother, and they have a hilarious scene around the breakfast table talking to Mark's brother about his medieval castle job and speaking Klingon.
442;As Sam, Natalie Portman is charming throughout, even though her character's random eccentricities constantly threaten to overwhelm her appeal.
443;Braff himself seems less assured as a leading man perhaps because he sets up his character to be more of an observer until he comes to life in the concluding scenes, yet he does create a sense of good will that makes you want to know what will happen to him throughout the story.
444;But on the plus side, Braff captures his childhood environment and adulthood angst with pinpoint emotional accuracy.
445;There is a good making.
446;A promising debut, rather flawed but still highly recommended.
447;Oh good heavens, if you like intelligent well.
448;written comedies, if you love nuanced performances and.
449;I'd assumed this movie was going to be this deep, intense, intimate excursion into a young success's reluctant but eye.
450;For starters, the movie is an abyss of the beginnings of really great characters.
451;Obnoxious performance by Natalie Portman.
452;"something star of a slightly better than average sitcom with big ideas aspires to create a new generation ""Graduate,"" a wake."
453;But, alas, Garden State just may be the best film you'll see all year.
454;Writer/Director Zach Braff gives a fantastic performance as an anti.
455;A travesy to be sure, as this is a movie that everyone desrves to see.
456;Garden state is quirky, hilarious, and yet totally heartwarming!
457;It's a movie that makes you reflect on your life and live through it with a huge smile!
458;The soundtrack is amazing, making every scene look that much better and more meaningful.
459;From the soundtrack to the perfect casting, this movie finds a connection to an interesting shift in everyone's life to adulthood.
460;I find every time I watch it, I love it even more.
461;Typical Indie flick with perfect dry, well.
462;Perfect date night movie too!
463;I guess it happens everywhere though and honestly, that's refreshing.
464;I think he does drama better than comedy actually.
465;I just loved this movie.
466;If you are still immature enough to get excited and fall in love with a movie just because it shows the occasional joint smoking, this is definitely for you.
467;Garden State is possibly the most realistic film to portray the depression that hits many of us in our mid.
468;In Zach Braff's film Garden State, he perfectly reveals the sadness and fear of being lost in a confusing time.
469;Amidst the sadness, Garden State exudes humor and hope, and the encouragement that life should be lived fully, even in the face of pain.
470;Garden State is a great movie.
471;It is very touching, funny, interesting and original.
472;Zach Braff did a really good job directing this movie and who can help not loving Natalie Portman.
473;Garden State also has an amazing soundtrack to go along with the movie.
474;good movie with memorable lines and scenes.
475;Zach Braff's movie Garden state is exceptional.
476;Not only does it have Natalie Portman in it, but it's one of those rare movies which really combines a good story with good, maybe even seminal, humor.
477;It's also full of really amazing observations, an outstanding script, also by Braff.
478;Perhaps because it plays at a slower tempo than movies tend to do these days, but I think it was absolutely the right choice.
479;i am extremely impressed that such a young man made such a wonderful movie.
480;This movie is amazing !!
481;The history it's very interesting.
482;the perfect example of how a good story can make a great movie.
483;I recommend it to everyone but don't expect Zach to be 'scrubs'.
484;I watched Garden State yesterday after hearing great things about it from my brother.
485;driven movie (the kind I typically like), more about everyone's quirks and interactions than about any actual events.
486;for the most part, Garden State is very well.
487;Ian Holm (as the main character's father) and Peter Sarsgaard (as an old friend from high school, Mark) fare particularly well, creating vivid people out of a relatively small number of lines.
488;Holm is of course a veteran of considerable stature in the craft, fresh from his turn as Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings.
489;Sarsgaard is another excellent actor, whom I had already seen in Center of the World.
490;Whether he plays a leading role or a supporting one, Sarsgaard is always a pleasure to watch.
491;It's tough to sympathize with this kind of person, and the viewer consequently feels almost as detached from him as he feels from the rest of the world.
492;for all its flaws, Garden State does boast some memorable dialogue and the soundtrack is very nice on the ears.
493;it's nice to see Braff put together a competent movie, as writer, director, and leading actor.
494;Garden State will resonate best with emotionally stranded twenty.
495;braff creates a story that is honest enough to be touching, quirky enough to be real.
496;his imagery is both profound and effective, almost primarily because of the sometimes dry, sometimes laugh out loud silliness of the dialogue and situations used to carry it.
497;if you like amazing music, talented actors, and incredible cinematography, this is the movie for you.
498;stunning technical elements aside, i walked out of garden state feeling good.
499;It was a very moving movie for me and most people that I know that have seen it.
500;It hits a college kid on a very personal level by addressing the fears and complications that we have experienced or are experiencing.
501;It opens your eyes to the simplicity of life and the things that matter.
502;It takes you through a journey of one guy that has been battling with his life and his unhappiness for most of his adult life until he finds a very querky, awkward girl.
503;i think that everyone should at least experience this movie because it is a very off the wall, touching movie.
504;It captures the feeling of going away and starting your own life at college or after college and coming home to hang out with the same people you did in high school.
505;garden State is a movie that will open your eyes to the world we are all living in.
506;It makes you feel very good after watching it and opens up the door to certain feelings that you didn't know how to address.
507;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think that any one who has ever gone away from home and came back later with a new life and new experiences will find that this movie really touches that part in your heart.
508;I feel that if you are ages 18.22 this movie will completely effect the way you feel about your life and what you really want out of it.
509;It will take you through the feelings you felt and then bring you to a point where you remember what it was like to finally figure it out.
510;"You ever have one of those ""wow"" moments after a movie?"
511;It's like a good song or a good book: you just feel satisfied when it's over.
512;It's a love story of the highest sort.
513;It's the story of the most significant journey in a man's life.
514;Zach Braff, who also directed and starred in the film, brilliantly crafted a screenplay that both connects you with the characters and allows you to examine your own life in their context.
515;In fact, you often laugh despite yourself throughout.
516;this is due only in part to the writing, as the acting is also superb.
517;Natalie Portman shines as the quirky, lovable Samantha who absolutely transforms Andrew's life.
518;the soundtrack also gets an honorable mention.
519;It adds to the mood and meaning of the movie.
520;a number of characters in Garden State talk about doing something unique, something like nobody else has ever done.
521;"best quote: ""Maybe that's all family really is."
522;Garden State, Zach Braff's directorial debut, is an impressive achievement.
523;"I have, since I saw the film last summer, become a huge fan of Zach and the music of ""The Shins,"" a band featured prominently throughout the Grammy."
524;The character played by Natalie Portman is quirky, but no less charming.
525;He returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral and reunites with old friends.
526;sweet, romantic, cool, and visually engaging.
527;"After reading some of the reviews here that trashed it, I found that I liked ""Garden State"" more than I expected to, though perhaps not for the ""right"" reasons."
528;The lead character, Andrew, returns to this for his mother's funeral, after having achieved a moderate amount of success as an actor in California.
529;inflated egos actually believing that viewers really care about their every move, what they had for lunch, etc.
530;I really enjoyed this unique movie.
531;I loved Natalie Portman in the movie and thought her acting and role was fabulous.
532;"It was very well thought out and a very ""smart"" movie."
533;The camera treatment is quite good, better than the picture.
534;well, you can figure that much out.
535;Wonderful story of a young man coming into his own.
536;Zach Braff and the cast of characters around him are nearly perfectly drawn.
537;Largeman returns home as the conquering hero, resting mostly on the laurels of his made.
538;"garden State is bizarre at times
539;It's a cute little film worth looking for.
540;What a relief from mainstream movies!
541;I do not want to give anything away but I will say that this will take you through a journey of laughter in this coming of age film.
542;It is one of the coolest movies of the year and not conventional.
543;A fun movie I used to love.
544;It has a stellar cast of people though that shows sometimes by doing big budget crap that on occasion stars can do movies that feel right.
545;I am a fan of Zach Braff and I think that he's very funny, but this movie did not make much of an impression on me.
546;A great, feel good, movie with the greatest freaking soundtrack ever.
547;It is rare when a film is conceived, written, directed and acted by one person and the result is a unique and timely little treasure like this one.
548;the action is fast, with pauses for some absolutely ludicrous events that are at once hilarious and tender.
549;All of the actors are superb, with Portman, Braff and Sarsgaard the most outstanding.
550;It may take a while to filter the storyline and process of filming through your mind: this is creative filmmaking at a new level.
551;But the ultimate effect is a piece of work that deserves repeated viewings and serves notice that Braff is a talent to watch.
552;I like the simplicity of the story, yet the characters are complex.
553;The movie takes it's time and calmly portrays the crazy lives of these folks in a subtle, yet interesting way.
554;I like the message of the movie, the characters are all interesting and funny in their own quirky way, and the soundtrack is great.
555;Strangely I feel everyone of us can in some way or the other relate to certain feelings of mixed emotions.
556;I think the direction in this movie stands out and the characters are just very interesting and un.
557;It has some really amazing music being played throughout the flick.
558;I've seen it once and I cant wait to give it a second watch.
559;This one stands out cause its somehow very serene and enjoyable.
560;I simply love the actress for her true to herself nature that never comes out.
561;I just came here to give it 5 stars.
562;This is a fantastic film and is thought.
563;provoking, funny, has an incredible soundtrack etc.
564;This is a very good movie.
565;Natalie Portman's character was also very interesting.
566;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
567;It's a beautiful and poignant portrayal of what it truly means to be human and the reality of our interdependence.
568;This movie is wonderfully written, very well acted, and a true reflection of everyday life, both the highs and the lows.
569;The more I watch this movie, the more I love it.
570;I've learned a lot about myself and the ways that I want to live and I owe much of that clarity to this film.
571;This movie has been one of my favorites since I first saw it in about 2005, and it continues to be one of my favorites!
572;Every time I watch it, it has the same emotional impact on me, and I always find something new with every viewing.
573;I recommend it to everyone.
574;thanks to the unrestricted rules of the conventional circuits .
575;films that breath a warm poetry, a fine artistic feature, surrounded of an accurate sense of existential vertigo.
576;That sad reencounter with his family and circle of friends dates him back to his origins, but besides will allow an unexpected love.
577;nathalie Portman steals herself the show with her memorable acting.
578;She looks so natural through her dialogues, absolutely identified with her role that constitutes one of the sever highlights of this unconventional portrait of what the lack of love may infringe on the human behavior and at the meantime how this same feeling brings him back to the normality.
579;a film that must be seen due its ambitious proposals.
580;One of the best soundtracks I've ever owned, unique dialogue, quirky and fun direction, and Natalie Portman and Zach Braff both hit their roles right on the head.
581;I saw this twice in the theaters and loved it both times .
582;one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still love it.
583;I have been recommending it to all of my friends and I will continue to do so.
584;Zach is beautifully awkward as Andrew, giving a convincing performance as someone who is gradually waking up after years of living life in a fog.
585;Natalie Portman is stupendous and glowing.
586;She manages to be goofy and beautiful and sad and joyful without overplayingn or being maudlin or sentimental about it.
587;The chemistry between Andrew and Sam seems authentic and the supporting cast certainly holds their own.
588;The soundtrack is amazing, rich, and well matched to the action in the movie.
589;Yes, the movie has its small flaws (the dialogue is occasionally stilted and awkward, and a couple of scenes seem a little forced), but overall I thought that the movie's heart more than made up for any of that.
590;It may be, though, as a friend and I decided, that you'll have to be in a certain stage of your life or identify with Andrew's situation in some way to truly appreciate it.
591;Could have made it more appealing to watch.
592;after those first 15 minutes or so, the movie took a wonderful turn for the better.
593;I've only seen it once but feel I need to one or two more times to fully understand everything.
594;natalie Portman did a wonderful job, leaving the audience to simply adore her and her character.
595;i found the ending to be so cute.
596;This is a great movie for people who feel they are floating their way through a meaningless life.
597;And for anything who just wants a great movie.
598;The positive press came pouring in.
599;What's admirable about the film is its setting, these are real characters with awkward lives.
600;digging friend is funny and scary.
601;It is nice that Holm gave this young director a chance, that shows that Holm is an artist willing to take risks.
602;It shows potential for Braff, and his co. star Portman.
603;Wow, what a great first outing for the filmmaker.
604;It's not flashy, but he captures wonderful performances.
605;Wow, it's like a 2 hour fortune cookie, how deep man.
606;garden State has such an amazing message attached to it as it subtly encapsulates what it feels like to be 20 something and lost.
607;It could be a simple throw away movie of boy meets girl, but Zack Braff puts so much heart into the script, acting and music that you can help but feel it strike a chord.
608;Every character feels real"
609;While there are comedic elements in the film, this is definately very dramatic.
610;He thought of everything except the passing of his mother.
611;The game soon requires a beautiful girl to kiss him, and she does so with more than just willingness.
612;spirited young woman whom he meets in a doctor's clinic.
613;Interesting how she is better at therapy than drugs or psychiatrists.
614;a film like this is a showboat for acting ability, especially for the film's writer and director, Zach Braff, in the engrossing role of Andrew.
615;And let it be said that Natalie Portman delivers what has to be the most colorful and energetic performance of her career.
616;She handles the role of Sam with a graceful aplomb in a role that should be talked about and studied for years to come.
617;"Placing Sam in this universe of delicate detail is something that Braff did with care
618;directors are as passionate about their films as he is.
619;Just imagine Roy from """"Matchstick Men"""" coming across a few of them and you'd have a spinoff worth seeing."""
620;I loved the dark and almost mysterious environment.
621;I just found reality and truth and honesty that are often pushed aside for a pretty story in most movies.
622;If you like movies that make you think, that make you feel raw emotions, this is for you.
623;He's been on multiple types of mood.
624;When he returns home, he meets a girl who is his opposite.
625;this film is funny, serious, romantic (in a non.
626;cute way), clever, artistic (without being too pretentious) all at the same time.
627;While a few things seemed a bit strained (I don't think that the main character really *needs* to be on drugs to feel alienated from his hometown, father, emotions, etc. it seems a bit gimmicky in a way, though overmedication is definitely a real problem), in all it flows really well and is believable in its dialogue.
628;twenties can relate to it, as well as people who can still remember what that time in their life felt like.
629;it ended up being a really funny movie that was just a story about normal people doing.
630;well, some strange things, but still about people who you can see yourself with everyday, because thats who you are with every day, normal people.
631;to sum this all up, i highly recomend this movie.
632;its very funny, entertaining, and moving.
633;Not only has Garden State topped my fave films of 04, it also eased it's way into my number 9 spot, of my favorite films of all time.
634;But above all, during a chance encounter, Andrew befriends a quirky cute girl named Sam, brilliantly portrayed by Natalie Portman, in a performance that should have got an Oscar nod.
635;Sam brings out a part of Andrew, that he though never existed in him.
636;this is a heartwarming, tragic, sad, hilarious, and everything.
637;A great film for whatever STATE your in.
638;Zach braff is makes this movie great.
639;So happy I got it for a great price too!
640;Underneath the incredibly odd surface are characters that feel real, and that you can relate with.
641;It is touching and seems to be the entire point of the film.
642;This is just the beginning of the bigger journey.
643;The blooper reel is obligatory, but still pretty funny.
644;Zach and Natalie are adorable and the feature commentary is highly interesting as well.
645;The two have amazing chemistry, and it is Natalie's acting and Zach's vision that carries this movie.
646;Who knew within the confines of Zach Braff's mind rested such a beautiful, moving script as Garden State.
647;And who knew he had within him the directing skills to pull off such a powerfully quiet performance and movie.
648;Garden State takes off with a vision of quirkiness, and lands nearly perfectly on its two feet at the end.
649;like Largeman is placed in the middle of his many issues, having at once to begin to deal with them.
650;You can trust Braff's unpredictability throughout the movie, because it's rich and gentle at the same time.
651;There are too many moments in this film that are memorable, and visually stunning.
652;In the meantime, sit back, relax, and enjoy spending time with the oddness of New Jersey in Garden State.
653;I have always been a big Scrubs fan so I had to see this movie.
654;The movie was so good because it felt so real.
655;I do not want to give away the movie, but it really had a good take on life.
656;For example, in a touching part of the movie, Braff's character defines love as a Mother giving her sleeve for him to wipe his nose.
657;They truly love each other, but they love each because of and in spite of their flaws.
658;This simulates real life and real love in comparison to the type of love that Hollywood generally protrays.
659;Great film and great accompanying soundtrack.
660;Garden State is a delightful, quirky film, geared to entertain with its eccentric characters and bizarre, dark humor.
661;age tale long overdue, this is a magical, edgy romantic comedy, (that guys will enjoy), with some hilarious moments, as well as a few tremendously moving ones.
662;And the acting is excellent!
663;I was left with a warm and fuzzy feeling for hours after the conclusion .
664;a welcome change from the film I saw prior to this, which gave me a headache!
665;zach Braff wrote the intelligent screenplay, directed it and plays Andrew Largeman, a twenty.
666;All Dr. Largeman wanted, and wants, (so he says), is for his son to be happy.
667;He's best known for his role as a retarded quarterback in a TV series.
668;In his heart and mind Andrew knows you can't go home again .
669;His mom (Jean Smart) is, literally, a space cadet.
670;Into this crazy mix comes the luminous Sam, (Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific here)!
671;spirited Sam at the doctor's office.
672;She is totally charming, fresh, and epileptic .
673;He gives her a ride home and she invites him in just in time to bury her pet hamster.
674;The combination of zero meds in his system, the knowledge that he can indeed cope without the prescription cocktail, and Sam's warmth, courage and acceptance, allows Andrew to open himself to emotion again.
675;He is even able to confront his father.
676;Garden State is a perfect date movie, also good for rainy days and Saturday night at home with popcorn.
677;The scene at the abyss is memorable .
678;I really enjoyed this movie.
679;I thought the acting and directing were wonderful, especially for a first time director/writer.
680;Zach Braff has a brilliant way of getting his point accross in a way that is easily taken, even when the material is a bit more difficult.
681;The bottom line for me is that I own this movie.
682;It's a bit dark but hopeful too.
683;I'm happy to have it as part of my film.
684;I was under the impression this was a comedy.
685;It was funny, but it's really more of a drama with some pretty funny scenes.
686;When his mother dies, he returns home to New Jersey from LA, where he must confront the reasons for his numbness.
687;There he meets impetuous, sweet and adorable Sam (Natalie Portman), a compulsive liar and epileptic who is far from numb.
688;Their relationship helps him wake up and face his pain.
689;as the movie unfolds, so does Andrew's story, and the reasons why he is the way he is.
690;I found the movie entertaining, intelligent, interesting, funny, and certainly moving.
691;On his directoral debut, Zach Braff hits home with this dramatic comedy aka a dramitey.
692;So after a while they become real good friends and we get all theses amazing sences of akwardness and amazing acting.
693;The movie is supurb and the soundtrack is great.
694;A couple of days ago I was thinking about it, and I was just simply like I have to see it again.
695;So I went and bought it, and I watched twice the next day.
696;While he's at the funeral he runs into a couple friends and the fun begins.
697;it's kind of a coming of age story as well as a comedy and a romance.
698;I thought the writing was good, soundtrack was excellent and cinematography did not take away from the story (as is the case with so many other films these days).
699;some are funny, some are poignant and some explain plot a tad bit better.
700;all in all, a most enjoyable movie.
701;On his silly comedy, Scrubs, with 2 second takes and plenty of post.
702;I'm so Indie and quirky.
703;and I want you to know it!
704;And they will cling to every new fad as much as they cling to their own unoriginality.
705;Great performance by a young Natalie Portman.
706;A tender movie that captures the angst and charm of suburban simplicity.
707;This movie makes you feel human again!
708;It has a wonderful sense of humor and a LOT of heart.
709;This will be in my top 20 favorites of all time.
710;"i found myself really impacted by the artistic pauses and snapshots of the ""human."
711;It had me so entranced, that I was as glued to my TV during the credits as I was during that long middle part.
712;When nothing's going right in your life, Garden State will go well in your life!The film has great style.
713;It seems like it's the kind of movie that would be dated pretty quickly, but it still holds up strongly 10 years after release.
714;My Wife wanted this movie, so i got it for her.
715;The opening scene sets up the story.
716;He meets some old friends and makes some new ones.
717;The friends and strangers are interesting.
718;The movie even takes the viewer to interesting spots in Newark, New Jersey.
719;Real life is in experiencing the pain and the joy.
720;It has some nice surprises, touching moments, and small laughs.
721;This is a very impressive directorial debut for Zach Braff.
722;garden State is, simply put, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
723;The movie is fresh, it's original.
724;the acting is superb, the jokes witty enough to require thought, and deep enough to be watched several times in the space of only a few days.
725;It reminded me of being young, having crazy friends, hanging out and meeting girls.
726;If you enjoy love stories with happy endings and a little quirky humor, you will definately like Garden State.
727;This movie is a classic.
728;I absolutely love the story, the character development, and the wonderful soundtrack.
729;This film is one of the best films of all time.
730;I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was great.
731;The escalators heading in two directions at the end, the making of a completely original dance, the touching of the father, the arc on the edge of the abyss, the silent Velcro.
732;natalie Portman is a great actress and I enjoy watching her on this films and others that she previously done.
733;Playing the role of a goofy, epileptic but cute, hometown girl, she steals the show.
734;She hits all the right notes.
735;wheel of a loved one, she habitually lies, and she's slightly crazy, but Andrew and we can't help falling in love with her.
736;"even so ""Garden State"" is well worth watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever."
737;Movies like this are either rare or one of kind.
738;I saw one episode of Scrubs and I thought Zach Braff had a lot of talent and potential.
739;Incongruous is the word, I believe.
740;"The movie is just amazing
741;It's warm and tragic, fun and real all at once.
742;My favorite line: Have fun exploring the infinite abyss.
743;It's such a traditional Hero/Fool journey.
744;He's given permission from the Guardian to explore and learns an important TRUTH which he takes back with him, to the 'real world' and he is transformed.
745;I give it 100 Gazillion Widgets!
746;the visual artistry in this film comes from framing and set design.
747;emotionally stirring coming of age story about a 20.
748;the visuals are arresting, but the young man at the center of everything, played by Braff, is disconnected and passive.
749;gARDEN STATE evolves into a marvelous, emotionally satisfying ride with offbeat characters and a unique sensibility.
750;Portman is wonderful as the girl who rescues Braff from a life of perpetual sleepwalking, and the two of them onscreen are pure magic.
751;I think Zach Braff is a brilliant genius.
752;sam, played by Natalie Portman, is adorably comical.
753;She knows she has imperfections, especially lying, yet she almost seems flawless, and I think there is an instant connection with this character"
754;I think a lot of people, especially with the way society is today, can even identify with Andrew's decision to finally live life, whether that means leaving a lithium induced haze, or finally appreciating everything around you.
755;You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for your kids, for the family you start, it's like a cycle or something.
756;It will make you laugh, it could make you cry, but overall, it leaves you with with this feeling that you are okay, and life, if not perfect, is okay.
757;The screenplay was amazingly well.
758;written, and the soundtrack is phenomenal .
759;i think this is a movie that many people will feel a strong connection with and can relate to, because it portrays everyday events .
760;simple and complicated ones .
761;What makes this movie so wonderful is that these events are shown with such beauty and poignancy, you can't help but feel for the characters in the movie.
762;This is a movie that will make you smile, laugh, cry, and, at times, a viewer may be awe.
763;struck by the creativity and vision that went into making this movie .
764;a superb directorial debut for Zach Braff!
765;This was an amazing movie.
766;I think first time writer and director Zach Braff did a wonderful job.
767;The movie was perfectly cast.
768;Natalie Portman's character was so real and alive that it seemed as though she was not even acting.
769;i saw the movie when questioning things in my life and I felt as though it helped me.
770;It is like watching someone come to life and seeing just how important living and feeling every emotion is.
771;the soundtrack is also perfect.
772;Each song matches each scene and gives a feel for what is going on.
773;I recommend purchasing the soundtrack, I did and I love it.
774;The more I watch it, the better it gets.
775;The two start hanging out which in turn turns into a very passionate relationship.
776;I thought it was very quirky and fun.
777;Natalie Portman has never been so beautiful to me.
778;I saw Zach Braff in a new light.
779;I never thought he was much of a charmer until now.
780;The soundtrack is great as well.
781;I was very impressed with this movie.
782;I liked this movie because I identified with its atmosphere of late twenty.
783;Even the people who didn't like the film laud Portman's performance.
784;The soundtrack is great too.
785;Gorgeous and stunning and heartfelt from beginning to end, scenes I'll never forget, dialogue that still rings in my ears and songs that are playing in my head every morning when I wake up.
786;Love and peace and hope.
787;"the quest for these is in every minuet and great detail of a person's life
788;I have never been so touched and inspired by a movie than I was as I sat in the theatre watching Garden State.
789;This movie is extremely funny, wonderfully romantic, and undeniably intelligent"
790;This movie is a must.
791;Every character in this movie is very well acted and each serves as a piece of the puzzle which makes this movie fit together so well.
792;This movie will always be in my top 10 favorites.
793;It is the type you can watch over and over again and get something new from it every time!
794;I love this movie, it is so unique and great.
795;I have to say that Garden State has instantly become my favorite film of all time.
796;I'm a cinema buff and really watch a LOT of films every year, but there are just a small hand full of films that I hold in very high regard.
797;Zach Braff has really constructed a fine piece of art that was just a breath of fresh air from start to finish and breaks the mold in almost every concievable way.
798;There are themes in this film that people of all ages can appreciate, and that's the real genius of it.
799;I didn't even smile once!
800;I give one star for the motorcycle with the sidecar, which was really cool.
801;In the space of four days he revisits his friends.
802;Amazing movie, wonderful price and service.
803;this is a classic, one every person should own!
804;I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the film perhaps even more than I did the first time.
805;When I spoke to her afterwards, she said she enjoyed it but that she could see that it was Braff's first effort behind the camera.
806;garden State was definitely the best movie I saw in 2004.
807;that is, waiting tables and getting bit parts.
808;He also meets Sam, played absolutely brilliantly by Natalie Portman.
809;Portman evidently shocked Braff by wanting to be in the film and I have to say, if this is how she acts in every film she's in, then she'll be winning Oscars very soon.
810;The character Sam is very vulnerable, yet strong.
811;andrew's father is also brilliantly played by Ian Holm.
812;What I found odd about this film was the way it was reviewed by the mainstream media.
813;But the fact is, the film truly speaks to people who are under the age of 30 and understand what it's like to be that age in the early 21st century.
814;it is rare that I see a film that I feel so strongly about once it's over .
815;"Garden State is one that I really feel like I ""get."
816;The soundtrack is excellent as well and the songs are in the exact order that they are in the film, as per writer.
817;Nothing stimulating or redeeming about it.
818;Braff does an excellent job in crafting a story that is connectable yet very off the wall.
819;His performance is equally as striking as the emotionally distance twentysomething.
820;She's smart, delightful, vibrant and off.
821;"the soundtrack is fabulous, especially Frou Frou's ""Let Go"", ""Such Great Heights"" by Iron and Wine (a postal serivce cover), and ""Don't Panic"" by Coldplay."
822;this is really a story of the human condition.
823;It's also about companionship and love.
824;It's about finding that person that brings out the life in you, the vitality.
825;i love this movie, because it's so original and really thought provoking.
826;They are original and real, like real people.
827;This is a beautifully written, directed, imagined and presented work of art.
828;Something that I hope Zach is proud of, and something that you MUST see.
829;I love showing this to friends that have never seen it.
830;the soundtrack is one of the best movie scores!Natalie Portman is absolutely adorable.
831;time actor, best known for playing a mentally challenged football player in a television movie, drops everything and heads home to New Jersey for the first time in eight years.
832;directing debut of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), is a finely.
833;tuned character study that has a lot to say about the human condition.
834;All jokes aside, Garden State emerges as a breath of fresh air in a stagnant late August, a film that not only has something to say, but does so in a refreshing, off.
835;As director, Braff has picked a winning cast who bring his characters to life.
836;Each and every one draw us into Braff's world, hitting just the right pitch to match the script's unique blend of dark comedy and raw emotion.
837;braff peppers the script with casual insights and bits of business that captivate us with their simplicity and honesty.
838;There are revelations, but their design isn't to slap us across the face but expose us to another level of the truth, and it's this sincerity that makes Garden State so inviting.
839;once home, Largeman makes the rounds, connecting with old friends (Peter Sarsgaard, perfectly laid back), new loves (Natalie Portman, sweet and engaging), marginal acquaintances (half the town thinks he killed himself), finally settling down for the much dreaded father.
840;braff is to be admired for making a film that is as entertaining as it is thoughtful.
841;His talent and connections have afforded him the opportunity to create rather than regurgitate.
842;For something to happen, that is.
843;meets neurotic yet beautiful and funny young woman .
844;i give it two stars because the cinematography and acting is good.
845;This movie is fantastic, acting, story, music mostly.
846;This movie has the best soundtrack in any movie I've ever seen.
847;Shows emotion and is unique.
848;And alot of memories comes with his return.
849;see some old friends and just relax from the stressy life he got.
850;Thanks to Sam, he'll eventually re.
851;discover the beauty of life, love and to finally get Through with some of the feelings about his childhood that he never could with the medication and never dared getting Through with in the first place.
852;Sam gives him courage, joy and makes him eventually realize what life is all about.
853;Garden State is a cute drama with good plot, character developments and interesting issues that touches the audience.
854;It reminds me of alot of European films with their simplicity but often so rich plots.
855;It also fot a few memorable scenes not to miss.
856;Other then great performences by Braff (who also wrote, directed and starred in his first lead role) and Porter who's wonderful!
857;"While ""Garden State"" may not have been one of the most watched films of 2004 it certainly is one of the best and warmly recommended to be seen at home with your family or friends."
858;To live in Los Angeles, one has to put themselves into a Garden State just to emotionaly survive the day .
859;Zach Braff has an amazing eye for everyday american life, especially the long road home of searching for ones self.
860;I hope Zach makes many more films from the heart.
861;I found so much of this movie answered the questions i had been having in my life.
862;It made me feel so good about what I have and ok with what I don't have.
863;It made me see what is important in life.
864;It sounds cliche to the maximum, but I laughed, I cried, and.
865;This is a spectacular movie.
866;"Garden State is a prototypical ""independent film,"" and I mean that in a good way."
867;marks of an independent film: quirky, funny, odd, off.
868;Writer/director/star Zach Braff is best known as an actor on the wonderful NBC sitcom, Scrubs.
869;(He brings the same comedic sensibility to this film.)
870;Like Kevin Smith before him, Braff has made a feature film homage to his native state of New Jersey .
871;Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen.
872;The movie meanders a bit and is probably better viewed at home, but still it is an impressive debut.
873;I thought it was a great movie, insightful and poignant.
874;I really enjoyed this film.
875;The actors are great, the story is interesting, the soundtrack is awesome.
876;Zach Braff did a great job in this movie.
877;It is a touching story about an actor who has come home when his mom has passed away, and about his not so great relationship wiht his dad, and a new relationship developing with Sam, played by Natalie Portman.
878;Portman did a great job as Sam, a girl who lies a lot and likes has an interesting life.
879;I really enjoyed the story in this movie and found it entertaining with touching moments and some funny ones too.
880;The best thing about this movie is the fact that the characters are interesting and have a real depth to them.
881;I think the whole process of Large stopping taking the medication and starting to feel and find love is nicely portrayed.
882;this is a big part of the film.
883;aND what delighted me more than the plot was the artistry that was exhibited in the story telling.
884;Actors filled supporting roles and cameo roles with incredible intensity and flavor, take Jean Smart, who played the mother of one of Andrew Largeman's best friends from his home town who now spends his time taking hits from a bong while at home and digging graves while at work.
885;after.year was admirably played by Ian Holm.
886;i was completely wrapped up in the storytelling .
887;"i adored ""meeting"" Sam with all her beloved eccentricities ."
888;in Newark, NJ and another line I will carry with me forever .
889;"Have fun exploring the infinite abyss and exactly the perfect response, ""You, too."
890;or your neighbor, your best friend.
891;Natalie Portman did an incredibly subtle and believable New Jersey accent.
892;I hope you will watch it with your heart and mind wide open.
893;and enjoy exploring the infinite abyss.
894;In the doctor's office, he meets Sam, who is played by Natalie Portman.
895;I have seen Natalie Portman in quite a few roles, and of all of them, the character she played in this movie is my personal favorite.
896;It turns out that Sam is an epileptic pathological liar with a love for all things animal and works in a law firm.
897;Throughout the movie, the two of them get to know each other better, and strong romantic feelings develop.
898;I definitely put this at the top of my list of must have movies of the year.
899;One of my favorite movies, I can relate a lot to Andrew in the movie.
900;affectionately known as Large to his friends.
901;the film moves at a moderately slow, but steady pace and its scored with a superlative soundtrack thats very effective.
902;Its rarely, if ever, dull, quite funny, very refreshing, sad at times, always unpredictable and excitingly original.
903;If you're under thirty you will love this film.
904;"The story reveals more with each repeated viewing, and the music ranks amongst the best soundtracks ever
905;treat yourself and get this one.
906;Maybe it was the fact that I greatly identified with Zach Braff's character, I don't know, but what I do know is, is that I loved this movie.
907;Zach Braff just made an excellent movie.
908;It moved me to tears, to words beyond speaking.
909;(""""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"""" for instance, is an excellent example of how this formula can be twisted around and made almost unrecognizably new.)"""
910;Portman and especially Sarsgaard are both such amazing talents that it's almost impossible to see how little they've really been given to work with in the way of character development from the script.
911;Braff obviously has a lot of talent, and I look forward to seeing what else he can come up with.
912;A beautifully told, soulful, brutally honest story of how a young man becomes his authentic self.
913;Appealing to men and women, not a chick flick but deep and moving.
914;zach Braff is a master of his craft.
915;This review is dedicated to those like me and serves only as a warning.
916;What's funny about watching a group of people engage in illegal voyeurism (peeping): the incident where the Bellboy wants his buddies to shut.
917;Best movie ever, a movie you could watch over and overGreat soundtrackZac Braff is a great writer and actorNatalie portmans is awesome!
918;Watch it when you want to feel happy and it will put you in a beautiful state of peace.
919;This movie helps you to stop, take a step back and see the world, not for what the media shows you, but as it from a real and ambient perspective.
920;The Garden State was funny, sad, full of excellent dialogue and has an awesome soundtrack .
921;Congrats to Zach Braff the writer/director of the best movie I've seen all year.
922;Great writing, great actors, and great everything.
923;Beautiful, this is what love should be like.
924;And why is that dysfunctional guys always get the good.
925;If you are into deep movies that are kinda weird with great music.
926;Jach Braff is amazing in this movie!
927;I saw this for the first time last night and today I have watching it 4 times.
928;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
929;I just liked that the movie is real.
930;My brother is taking a film class in college and they review movies in class all the time.
931;Andrew Largeman returns home after 9 years to attend his Mom's funeral.
932;He meets a girl named Sam.
933;He soon learns that she may hold the key to his future happiness.
934;this is a great movie.
935;It's a very cute romantic comedy.
936;Actually, it is more of a comedy than a romance.
937;It does, however have some sweet moments and a very touching conclusion.
938;It's a conclusion that is very powerful.
939;Garden State is a film that everyone should see.
940;The first half hour of Zack Braffs debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope hell get to make more films soon.
941;It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper.
942;middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as Ive seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling.
943;after that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but its still full of goodies.
944;Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated.
945;this story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well.
946;Great use of music as well.
947;but all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost.
948;The best part of the movie was the end credits because the movie was finally over.
949;While watching the movie I was confused during almost the entire thing, but at the very end I finally got it.
950;I thought the movie was awesome and surprising a really good movie.
951;I would recommend this movie to anyone b/c I thought it was just really good.
952;Garden State is a funny, slightly charming comedy about coming back home, finding yourself again, falling in love and letting the emotion grow where it was stopped dead by an event in your past.
953;i'll give the movie some credit as far as interesting characters and catchy dialogue go.
954;And there were some pretty funny parts throughout the picture.
955;But this is just the kind of film I watch, enjoy it to an extent, and completely forget about it the next week.
956;Must have in an good feeling collection!
957;I was totally impressed with this movie.
958;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
959;Its very well written and has a great plot and overall theme althought at times it can seem like another overated indie movie to some, I thinks its a refreshing change from the romantic comedy norm, particularly with the romance being a constant undertone until the very end.
960;It is one of my top 5 movies.
961;Its original, touching, and funny, and has 2 of my favorite actors in it (Zach Braff and Natalie Portman).
962;I highly recommend this movie.
963;Terrific characters, Great acting, great story!
964;Watching a young man unravel and find himself as he lets go of the psychiactic drugs he's lived his life on.
965;You feel at ease again when the story beautifully undulates and cleanly unfolds, again treating you like an adult.
966;The movie is like a great book to cozy up with and a coming.
967;age story you will find comfort and commonality in.
968;The relationship between father and son is one of the ways we can gauge the progress that Andrew is making in the film as he finds his own voice again.
969;"i keep hearing that ""Garden State"" is ""The Graduate"" for this generation, but instead of seeing young Dustin Hoffman I keep thinking young Ray Romano (heavily sedated on drugs) every time I see Andrew."
970;If you do not cotton to its Indy sensibilities and sense of humor, then there is a good chance this film will not click for you.
971;Garden State is a dark comedy, stopping well short of being a black comedy, but just like eating chocolate some people will find it to be to dark to enjoy.
972;"A symphony of melancholy shots set to the beautifully arranged track ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou (a band that this movie has helped me 'discover') I knew from then on that I would do whatever it takes to see this movie in theaters."
973;I gathered some friends and we road.
974;tripped to see this movie.
975;This was one of the most emotionally touching film's I've ever laid eyes on.
976;Zach Braff has already proven to the world that he's a talented visionary of a director and did an absolutely amazing job writing and acting as well.
977;I'm very excited about this film's almost surreal success as it will most definelty provide more opportunities to zach to share with us some more heartfelt and meaningful content.
978;I still watch Scrubs every tuesday because, like Garden State it's a show that has hilarious shennanigans to show you, but at the same time, provides a powerful message.
979;It is refreshing to see such a beautiful movie get so much attention.
980;Braff tells the story of an emotionally distant young man learning to reconnect with life, as he returns home and faces his old life and a fascinating girl.
981;the beauty of its execution stands alone.
982;The acting, set design, cinematography and music are perfectly chosen.
983;All of this gives the movie an ethereal air to it .
984;it is honest, beautiful and slow.
985;it does not move along at a fast pace and is content to tell a story in a very beautiful way.
986;Those who do connect will be greatly rewarded.
987;This movie is probably one of the best of year in my opinion.
988;While far from perfect it is a fairly impressive script and I think the movie definitely connects on an emotional level.
989;i also found the believable dialogue to be one of the stronger points of the movie.
990;establish your bearings coupled with the residue of many years of pharmaceutically.
991;"While it can be said that some of the scenes could be accused of being shot for ""cuteness,"" this is a romantic comedy (albeit of a somewhat darker grain) after all."
992;I think it is thoroughly enjoyable and emotionally touching movie which should not be missed!!
993;This is an interesting movie worth seeing.
994;his most interesting friend is Natalie Portman, a young woman with an odd sense of humor that has her making up tall tales.
995;I'm fine with her sense of humor.
996;Zach Braff wrote it, directed it and starred in it.
997;The film did well and it even got a couple of awards.
998;And that's the nicest things I can say about it.
999;In other words he's passive and wide eyed and an observer of the world rather than an active participant.
1000;Along the way he meets Natalie Portman and a romance develops.
1001;And so I managed to see it all, hoping it would get better as it went along.
1002;i went to this movie with absolutely no idea what it was other than a few friends telling me it was good.
1003;I was that kid who moved to Hollywood, and when i came back to my Jewish family, i met up with old friends, and everything dramatically changed.
1004;this movie will be as good for you as you WANT it to be.
1005;it will change your life i promise you.
1006;something is allowed to flourish into a touching coming of age story.
1007;"the premise is simple and effective: Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a young man who has recently decided to ""take a vacation"" from the numbing antidepressants he has been on for a decade."
1008;As Andrew reimmerses himself back in his home town in the Garden State, he must deal with old friends, new love, and deep family issues.
1009;Natalie Portman steals every scene, with her charming lies and intense facial expressions.
1010;I feel that Garden State is more of an artsy and emotional film than anything else.
1011;While in New Jersey, he meets up with some old friends and also befriends the free.
1012;spirited Sam, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman.
1013;"She helps him in his quest to find himself and ""break free"" of the medications that have been holding him back his whole life."
1014;i didn't really understand the purpose of some of the scenes in the movie (for example, the party at the beginning of the movie), but otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.
1015;"From first hand knowledge of living in LA, Zach got the entire soundtrack from KCRW, the local ""hip"" music station in the area."
1016;The fact that there isn't one around AND that she prefers you, then it means shes absolutely, completely f*cking insane.
1017;This is a quirky romance with emotional depth to it.
1018;It also has a great deal of humor to it.
1019;The characters were unique and unpredictable, and well.
1020;The things I liked most about it were that it had unique plot and characters at a time when so many movies seem to be a recycle of older stories, and it used humor effectively during characters' hard times.
1021;"modern classic with an intriguing ""below."
1022;"radar"" approach to touching your brain that has become the calling card of Zach Braff."
1023;"funny lines such as, ""Are you really retarded?"
1024;"Because that Corky actor is really retarded in real life, and you're a better actor than him"" ."
1025;Nothing to relate to here.
1026;"Because it's ""cool"" to be a director, I guess."
1027;Even the cheesy happy ending is incredible.
1028;Everything about this movie is awesome.
1029;This movie is story driven and you want to follow it to the end.
1030;The writing is top notch, acting superb and photography well done.
1031;That is both perceived and real.
1032;His portrayal of going home and meeting old friends and family seem very realistic to me.
1033;beautiful Natalie Portman enter into his life and she starts to accompany him during his last days with his friends of his youth.
1034;Her character as well as some quirks she needs to work through.
1035;The movie takes us through a range of emotions.
1036;And yet there are a couple of classic scenes that you will find yourself laughing at.
1037;the soundtrack of this film is as enjoyable as watching the film was.
1038;A mix of golden oldies and fresh indie.
1039;pop, this is a mellow sweet collection.
1040;"But the beautiful music of ""Garden State's"" soundtrack serves as a poignant reminder of the movie."
1041;unlike other's who have written bad reviews I think that this quirky movie stands on its own and is worth seeing.
1042;Watch it with a date.
1043;"I like Zach Braff
1044;His show """"Scrubs"""" is one of my favorite sitcoms on television right now."""
1045;When I heard of this movie I was excited to see Zach directing in a film in which he plays a serious part.
1046;zach Braff is likeable in this film.
1047;Zach plays the character very well.
1048;He proves that he can play a comedic role as well as a dramatic one.
1049;top character takes a while to tolerate, but never fully becomes likeable.
1050;While watching the movie, I patiently waited for a scene where the characters show some heavy emotion, but every time one was about to happen, I felt that director Zach pulled back by adding some quirky humor.
1051;"the ""adventure"" the characters go on, if you can call it an adventure, felt kind of forced."
1052;however, despite these setbacks, the film has strong moments.
1053;One of them is the opening dream sequence of a plane going down with Zach's character in it.
1054;One of my favorite scene is one at Portman's backyard pet cemetery.
1055;This scene was probably the strongest scene emotionally.
1056;the soundtrack is good and the imagery and sets are good to look at.
1057;I would recommend this film to someone who wants to see it so they can make their own judgement.
1058;i do give credit to Zach Braff for making a decent directorial debut and for giving a superb performance.
1059;I look forward to seeing his future work and hope his next film will be much better.
1060;"You can be cute a la ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with random quirky scenes, or you can be cute a la an endearing Ferris Bueller."
1061;Give me a catharsis or a twist of an ending, and I will Ponder.
1062;"Listen up you ""geek"" filmgoers."
1063;You and the critics latch onto something in these type of movies that simply isn't there.
1064;The characters and story have been told a hundred times before in a more original and unique way.
1065;Go to any colleges film festival and you'll see this type of film made by most of the students.
1066;Garden State is truly a movie that borders on genius.
1067;depressents, in this world where he can't even feel anymore, yet, it is presented with a sweet and lighthearted nature that is so absolutely needed in a picture like this.
1068;Natalie Portman SHINES as Sam, a highly spirited, optomistic, good.

1070;religious experience, and it is one of the most wonderful moments in any film of 2004.
1071;I took a chance, and it was a wonderful decision.
1072;It is truly a gem.
1073;Zach Braff makes his directoral debut in this amazing film about love, death and life after medication.
1074;The soundtrack that accompanies only adds to the journey this film takes you on.
1075;Braff, with an outstanding supporting cast (Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm), shows you that life isn't about where you're going, but about where you are and who's there with you.
1076;The emphasis is on the eccentricities, and unexplored corners, of small town life.
1077;town characters is more realistic than the traditional Hollywood paean to the wackiness of rural life.
1078;for all the serious subject matter, this is actually an uplifting movie, with plenty of very funny comedic scenes that make and happy spots to make us feel good.
1079;One scene in particular, featuring a Medieval Times Knight who romances his friend's mother in Klingon, is very funny.
1080;this is the kind of movie that abounds in independent film, but which has combined art and realism with the commercial value and production value that make it viable for a major studio to get behind it.
1081;I remember those when I was a kid.
1082;I thought they were pretty stupid back then but it was funny that the makers of this movie remembered them.
1083;"Although the acting is quite good and the cinematography is excellent
1084;Look also for a good performance by Ian Holm.
1085;samantha and Andrew befriend each other and slowly Samantha's warmth and natural charm make Andrew feel true emotions again"
1086;garden State is truly a film for those of us who like romantic comedies.
1087;"The acting is quite convincing
1088;In addition, Zach Braff should be commended for writing a solid screenplay.
1089;time director Zach Braff also stars in and wrote the screenplay for """"Garden State"""", 2004's most original and charming American romantic comedy after """"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""""."""
1090;Overall, though, it is a satisfying delight.
1091;He works as a waiter in a trendy restaurant.

1093;Along the way, Andrew meets a very unique girl [Natalie Portman].
1094;depressants and therapy for a dozen years, break free and become himself for the first time?The cast is sublime and manages to override all of the mostly minor script deficiencies.
1095;The music is exceptionally appropriate.
1096;"for everyone who has ever been estranged from their roots, then found a route home, ""Garden State"" is a real find."
1097;The characters were real, with sincere emotion exuding from their dialogue and action.
1098;Braff definitely has potential in writing, and his directing is decent as well.
1099;It's an all around good movie.
1100;well I just have to say that some people are not very good at critiquing art, just criticizing the artist and cutting down people that appreciate the artwork to make themselves look intelligent.
1101;Natalie Portman is awesome in this excellent movie.
1102;Probably my favorite movie of 2004 that no one has heard of.
1103;"Now, maybe the movie would be better if people hadn't told me it was ""amazing"" ""the best movie ever"" before i had seen it, because it definetly IS NOT."
1104;something actor living in L. a. figuring out his life.
1105;His character, Andrew Largeman, is a 20.
1106;Yes, I know, he's kicking his own over.
1107;the story is quite simple.
1108;He also meets a new person in his life, the girl Sam played brilliantly by Natalie Portman in one of the best roles I've ever seen her in.
1109;If you are into indie music you will love the soundtrack.
1110;It is so good that it even won a grammy award.
1111;Each time I watch it I get something more from it.
1112;It's one of those movies that you grow attached to the characters each time you watch it.
1113;he meets up with quirky Sam (Natalie Portman) and starts a friendship that blooms into a touching warm relationship.
1114;functional scenes are covered up with clever camera shots and FANTASTIC music.
1115;It does have a happy ending with Large realizing he needs to stop with the prescription drugs and deal with the problems at hand and maybe share a life with Sam.
1116;Zach Braff and Natalie Portman give performances that are hilarious and touching.
1117;I would recommend this movie to anyone who like a good story to add to their collection.
1118;In fact that's really funny, I should make a movie about that I'd be rich.
1119;Now I love many kinds of movies, but I can only take so much art house cinema.
1120;This movie is probably one of my favorites.
1121;She said I should go see it and boy am I glad I did.
1122;Natalie Portman and Zach Braff play people that are so realistic that you feel like you are in the movie and hanging out with them.
1123;If you havent seen this movie then see it.
1124;And if you have, then see it again.
1125;This one came fast and in perfect shape.
1126;It is so rare these days to find a film with this kind of honesty and beauty and truthfulness.
1127;a film with a soul .
1128;"Filled with raw emotions, incredible humor and fantastic film making, Zach Braff has made one of the most Real"" films I have ever seen."
1129;How powerful love can be.
1130;"With an amazingly impressive soundtrack I highly recommend this film to anyone."""
1131;I had high hopes for this movie, after all it had gotten such great reviews and Natalie Portman is in it, one of the more promising young actresses in Hollywood today in my opinion.
1132;I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Real Women Have Curves, and Tart.
1133;packed' plots, and they all could have been about real people's lives.
1134;So since this movie falls into the same genre I thought for sure I would like it.
1135;It makes me wonder: if I made a movie about my life, would it sell this well?
1136;This movie will change the way you feel and think about love, life, sex, drugs, family, and death.
1137;It is an amazing, moving movie that will shake your very soul.
1138;this is a must see for everyone!!
1139;I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a more indie feeling film .
1140;I heard a lot of good things about it, though, and the soundtrack rocks, so I finally decided to watch it when it was on cable, and OH MY GOD!
1141;This is SUCH an amazing movie!
1142;Braff wrote the script as well as directed and starred in the film, and he did a fabulous job.
1143;Braff's character, Andrew, is a small.
1144;"braff, Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast of ""Garden State"" are amazing in this film, but Portman steals the show with her hilarious performance as Sam."
1145;This movie is very touching but also very funny, and I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row!
1146;It's a wonderful story about seeking out what you want in life and making the most of it.
1147;All that I will become rests in her hands, and I have to let go.
1148;This cage that has held me still must be broken, and he has to set me free.
1149;And in return, I will forgive him, but that perfect portrait of happiness will remain only in his memory.
1150;And it is now my turn to let go, touch down, and finally feel what it is like to be alive.
1151;I have to say this is one of the best that I have seen in a long time.
1152;It's a feel good movie with out the cheesyness and I found myself laughing at the dry humor throughout.
1153;He kind of day dreams through the ceremony at the cemetary and then goes out partying with heavy drugs with his friends.
1154;the movie has some really hilarious parts and I understand that Zach was the actual writer/director.
1155;Zach Braff (The Broken Hearts Club, Tv's Scrubs) wrote and directed this funny, emotional and great movie in which he stars as a kid who comes home for a few days becayse his mother has just passed away.
1156;In the process he sees old friends and meets a sexy hyperactive Natalie Portman (Closer, Mars Attacks!)
1157;shes exceptional and Peter Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Center Of The World, Shattered Glass) gives yet another good supporting role as one of Braff's old buddies who still lives at home with his druggy mom and has a job as a grave digger.
1158;he imbues the movie with such beauty, class and meaning.
1159;the best movie that I've seen this year!
1160;This was obviously a labor of love.
1161;His efforts to start living are fueled and aided by a beguiling and vital young woman played by Natalie Portman.
1162;All the performances are first rate, and the emotional punch and suspension of disbelief are never hampered by the belly laughs.
1163;See it with your special someone.
1164;That pretty much sums up his life.
1165;Okay, that last job is cool.
1166;Away from his drugs for the first time in his life, he begins to wake up and the audience is encouraged to wake up with him.
1167;The film's music, dialogue, and camera angles shift from dreamy floating sequences to a much snappier pace.
1168;She turns Sam into a living, breathing woman and a worthy counterpart to the not.
1169;They go to a lot of parties, visit some wacky characters, and go on a quest for a treasure at the bottom of an Abyss (Braf played Dungeons and Dragons, I can tell).
1170;The beginning is slow and meandering, but that's on purpose and appropriate for an art film.
1171;Which is a good thing too, because otherwise we'd end up with the same kind of non.
1172;somethings, my husband and I absolutely LOVE this film.
1173;and Natalie Portman is spectacular, as always.
1174;Sure there are success stories, but those who take make the leap gamble their future career opportunities in Hollywood.
1175;Now a moderately successful actor, Andrew makes the decision to go cold.
1176;As anyone who has ever embarked on such a cinematic challenge of the limits of both patience and ambition, even for those not in their initial effort, can tell you, achieving the proper tone and style in which to win over the audience is an intricate balancing act so rarely achieved in the modern mainstream Hollywood environment.
1177;With that in mind, Braff's efforts in the role of Andrew Largeman, the protagonist of the picture, are like those of the character himself in that they are only moderately successful.
1178;Natalie Portman gleams with this illuminating radiance in the role of Sam, the romantic interest of Andrew Largeman, and is suited perfectly opposite Braff in the charming subplot of the film, though it was felt as if this portion of the screenplay could have been expanded upon earlier rather then later in the picture, but in any case it works out fine.
1179;as long as you play a hooker that is, she is a treasure to watch onscreen in this film nonetheless.
1180;ian Holm, the brilliantly talented British actor more commonly remembered for his recent appearance as Bilbo Baggins in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, is greatly underutilized in the role of Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman.
1181;The rather intense interactions and conversational engagements held between Holm and Braff sprinkled sporadically throughout the film are intriguing and poignantly insightful into how divergent the relationship between father and son can become as a result of elevated variant emotions in regards to a single incident involving a loved one.
1182;Putting it more sincerely, Garden State is not exactly a fantastic film, but there are enough memorable moments contained in it to make it at least recommended for someone else to watch.
1183;Although one can certainly argue that the modern generation has evolved into a society which has sought quick.
1184;It really is a great romantic comedy, but really it's more than that.
1185;There is a nice blend of drama and comedy through out the film.
1186;Some of the film will bring a small smile to your face, but other parts will have you laughing out loud.
1187;In my opinion this is one of the better comedies that came out this year.
1188;It's atleast worth a try.
1189;I related to the film on a more personal note.
1190;Its simple but also very complex, two concepts which are hard to balance.
1191;The film portrayed reality more vividly than anything I have seen in a while.
1192;The soundtrack is also amazing.
1193;The Shins avante garde compositions tie the film together.
1194;Garden State (2004) Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Ron LiebmanRated R. (off color moments)Spectacularly quirky Indie film with something important to say.
1195;sad, romantic, odd, charming and brilliant.
1196;New every time I see it.
1197;garden State is about as irresistible as an offbeat film can possibly get.
1198;highly original and free spirited.
1199;It is definitely its own brand of movie, so very original and thoughtprovoking throughout, with a real heartfelt bent.
1200;the scene in the doctor office waiting room with the dog is a real hoot.
1201;Funny, sad and everything in between.
1202;Good acting and worth the money.
1203;Some unique camera tricks, such as when the main character does drugs at the party.
1204;Garden State is a quirky Generation.Y love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff.
1205;Garden State is one of those films that is populated with idiosyncratic characters.
1206;Jean Smart has a couple of good scenes as Mark's mother.
1207;Ian Holm mostly creates an impression, rather than a character, as Andrew's father, because he has so little to do.
1208;This supporting cast is so impressive that it left me feeling that their talent had been underutilized.
1209;"But ""Garden State"" belongs to the genre of ""quirky love stories"", and that is what it delivers."
1210;Many of the film's best moments are found in its absurdist humor.
1211;The love story is sweet.
1212;And the characters are distinctive.
1213;Both commentaries are casual but interesting, without long lulls between remarks.
1214;If you listen to only one, I recommend the second, technical, commentary, which is a little more engaging and substantive.
1215;Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.
1216;Quirky, funny, and melancoly at the same time this is a highly enjoyable film.
1217;"Natalie Portman is so good in this it's almost enough to make you forget how bad ""Phantom Menace"" was."
1218;I was impressed by most fo the film.
1219;(guess that's the part of me that likes to laugh .
1220;i also learned that zach braff can act and portray someone other than JD (scrubs) and he can be very good at it.
1221;early 20 year olds taking charge of their life is moving than by all means watch this.
1222;"I'm sure the words ""real"" and ""personal"" appear quite often in subsequent reviews of this film."
1223;but for what it is, a first effort for a very young writer.
1224;director, it is quite good.
1225;this is Natalie Portman's best acting since The Professional.
1226;it does get a little syrupy in the end, but I think you'll agree, that the appealing nature of the lead couple, earns it.
1227;One of my favorite movies!
1228;I love watching this over and over.
1229;There are some really artful moments captured by Braff, whilst Andrew's friends seek to null themselves in drugs he inversely begins to wake from such a state.
1230;Finally some indie rock getting the attention it deserves.
1231;A lovely, sensitive movie with great music about self.
1232;this movie has a heart.
1233;The camera effects were amazing!
1234;Get ready for the most differnt romatic movie of all(in a good way) that is just a great explanation for life!
1235;It wasn't a particularly funny movie, but it was very real and that is what I loved about it the most.
1236;I felt the characters were unique and realistic.
1237;absolutely the best movie I've seen in years.
1238;Garden State is my favorite movie of all time.
1239;Everything about this movie is fantastic, and it all comes together incredibly well.
1240;There is so much charm and heart in the movie, and while at times it is a bit sad, it is filled with brilliant comedy and convincing characters.
1241;The music is just another amazing part.
1242;Every time I watch this movie, I notice adorable new details and take away interesting new meanings.
1243;do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
1244;Writer/Director/Lead Actor Zach Braff has put together one of those films that makes you excited for what he will do next.
1245;Garden State is a quirky, inventive, and ultimately moving Comedy that has real heart.
1246;The smart dialogue, subtle humor, and heart.
1247;tugging emotional scenes make this film a must see.
1248;the acting is what makes this movie so incredible.
1249;Natalie Portman gives a career defining performance, Zach Braff is stellar, and Peter Sarsgaard rounds it out with another brilliant performance.
1250;The featurette on the making of the film is also good.
1251;braff is funny and he does have some good scenes in this movie but it's like he had a stand up act and decided to build a movie around it.
1252;Whenever I rate a movie, I base it on two things.
1253;It has pretty rounded out characters and plot, IF you're into this sort of story, which I'm not.
1254;I found it really meaningful and sad enough to be touching.
1255;I'll definitely rewatch and mull over it many times.
1256;Video came in good condition and in timely manner.
1257;ALthough it is an overall good movie it is a little drawn out and nothing much happens from the beginning of the movie to the end.
1258;I'd have to say that this is my favorite movie of 2004.
1259;Just give it a chance.
1260;Zach Braff has done something remarkable for a debut film project, and its an achievement he should be very proud of.
1261;This film is a wake up call.
1262;Emotional pain is a burden everyone has to work through and deal with, and finally accept before moving on.
1263;the great thing about this independent film, as in many independent films, is that it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula.
1264;He meets the lovely and quirky Natalie Portman at the doctor's office.
1265;"see this film and ""Closer"" and you will be captivated by her range."
1266;"I loved her performances in both films, but she especially has unique charm in ""Garden State""."
1267;there are many quirky characters in this film and a couple of them seem caught up in some pyramid schemes.
1268;My favorite small performance is by Method Man, who almost steals the film by his very brief, but hilarious scene.
1269;That's because the overall message of the film is simply powerful and one we should all take to heart.
1270;We should live a life that's uniquely ours and seek moments where we attempt to do things no one else might have ever done before.
1271;See this film again and again.
1272;Its simply amazing and Zach Braff deserves huge kudos for making this film.
1273;The film is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and never tire of it.
1274;The soundtrack is also very well put.
1275;together and makes each scene that much more enjoyable.
1276;Within about 10 minutes into the movie, I knew that whomever directed this was definitely talented, and whomever had written it was equally talented.
1277;By the end of the movie and the credits, I realised who was behind all this, and I was surprised.
1278;even though the main plot is relatively simple, this movie has truly compelling bits of weirdness and oddities.
1279;"If you're into details, you'll probably love this film as much as I do
1280;The direction is splendid and the substance is pure, not to mention the soundtrack which lets you know that someone is a tasteful listener of music (that being Mr. Braff, again).
1281;natalie Portman is absolutely stunning in this movie.
1282;She truly is amazing and talented"
1283;well they're just a fantastic pair.
1284;compared to most movies, this one comes as a breath of fresh air.
1285;"It's inspiring too because it does so much with ""so little""
1286;Honestly, I put very much hope in him.
1287;But somewhere along the line, you see """"Ordinary People,"""" """"Fight Club,"""" """"The Graduate,"""" and any other number of movies about a young man going through finding himself, having turned off his senses either intentionally or unintentionally to the world around him, and you realize that there is a sensitive, intelligent, observant, brutal/poignant, honest, and to be frank, much better way to tell this same story."""
1288;the plot develops at a pointedly and pointlessly quirky and uphill pace.
1289;And he's got about the mental and emotional development of a newly hazed frat boy.
1290;"turning at it's highest points and I think is best described by one of the other reviewers as ""mastarbatory."""
1291;I think my girlfriend also summed this movie up well as Scrubs.
1292;The movie starts well, with some unique perspective on characterization and techniques in revealing the alone.
1293;What is there is merely the romance plot, which, inevitably leads to whole movie to end in a commercial way, like many others high.
1294;Portman gives an impressive performance, which really revives my memory of her in Closer.
1295;This movie has great characters, sympathetic and real while also being a bit quirky.
1296;The story, the events, the realizations, and the growth of the characters all form a solid cohesive whole.
1297;The soundtrack is also great, capturing a nice snapshot of music at this point in time that will likely be a touchstone for decades to come.
1298;I found it rather cute, and yes, there were some situations and characters I could relate to.
1299;Natalie Portman also gives a rather good performance as Zach Braff's love interest, and if her quirks seem a little over.
1300;But in all honesty, Sideways, a much more complex and emotionally rich film about forty.
1301;somethings, moved me much more (to tears almost).
1302;Definitely has a Jersey feel to it .
1303;"one warning is that there is a strong ""drug theme"" to this movie."
1304;"i recommend the ""Station Agent"" instead of this film ."
1305;The director did a good job picking the actors and their own quirks.
1306;I recommend you watch this movie with people you care for.
1307;It touches the heart and teaches some valuable lessons about everyday life and the loved ones around you.
1308;I loved this movie, I found it to be a very reflective experience.
1309;aldous Huxley's book 'Brave New World' is referenced in the story.
1310;Andrew Largeman, Zach Braff's character decides to escape his soma/lithium existence and finally open his eyes, start feeling again and actually find community, identity and stability.
1311;What an excellent poignant and comedic debut by Zach BraffA couple of themes explored are: 'being homesick for place that doesn't even exist' our idea of what should be, but often isn't, and finally coming to terms with that.
1312;"And the other as sung by Frou Frou ""There's beauty in the breakdown', change takes courage so Let Go."
1313;two great young actors, Peter Sarsgaard as Mark and especially Natalie Portman as Sam are prefect bookends to Andrew Largeman.
1314;There are many great little visual touches, such as his neurologists having so many plaques that he hangs one on the ceiling.
1315;I found Garden State to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1316;The uniqueness and creativity throughout the entire movie reflects the genuis of Zach Braff.
1317;He is definatly one of the greater writers of our times.
1318;The love aspect of the story is also fantastic (Its a romatic comedy).
1319;In fact, I found Natalie Portman to be an outstanding actress in this movie.
1320;"She plays the part of ""Sam"" flawlessly."
1321;"Peter Saarsgard, who played ""Andrews"" friend, was also very good."
1322;the soundtrack is outstanding as well.
1323;Even if you don't like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack.
1324;They integrate it with the movie very well.
1325;The appropriate songs are played at the appropriate times.
1326;Just a good flow all together.
1327;the entire movie has a very real yet, silly overtone.
1328;Its things like this that make the movie great.
1329;All the metaphors were well thought out and truely unique.
1330;bottom Line: Truely outstanding movie.
1331;Some of my friends hailed it as the best movie they have ever seen, some the most romantic.
1332;Does it live up to expectations.
1333;A journey of self discovery ensues.
1334;while the story is hardly groundbreaking, I actually fell in love with this movie, largely because of the fantastic cast and superb dialogue.
1335;Zach Braff's directorial debut is actually very good.
1336;The characters are a delight to watch.
1337;They have their share of good moments and self doubts, just like us.
1338;Zach Braff, who practically typifies wackiness in Scrubs does pretty much the same here, but toning it down a level and it works wonderfully.
1339;Natalie Portman, who I feel is one of the best actors of our generation (or my generation, at least) is great as Samantha.
1340;Portman has been in such diverse roles in her short career, and she pulls it off very well each and every time.
1341;"Her performance here adds a whole lot of ""heart"" to the movie."
1342;The rest of the cast, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and even Jean Smart provide memorable supporting performances, that stays with you even after the show.
1343;Watch how something you've always thought as petty, turn into something thoughtful.
1344;"An example of this, is the idea of a ""home""."
1345;They went hand in hand, the shots of the neighbourhood were beautiful, fitting the story exceptionally well and Zach Braff has an ear for good music.
1346;A nice selection of songs that leaves you with some sort of emotion, for the characters and their experiences.
1347;all in all, a good movie that's worthy of my recommendation.
1348;Just take it for what it is and enjoy the moment.
1349;This movie is magnificent and all should see it.
1350;Truly a beautiful piece of film making.
1351;Personally I think this movie proves that we need some sort of eugenics program for film, so future generations could enjoy this kind of art.
1352;I guess I should start with telling you how amazing this movie is.
1353;this is a compassionate tale of a dysfunctional family that through a series of tragic events may have found a way towards functionality.
1354;It was great to walk out of this and just feel good.
1355;zach Braff does an excellent job as an actor and director.
1356;and Natalie Portman is just amazing as Sam.
1357;She constantly made me smile.
1358;and the 'original moment' scene was classic.
1359;the love aspect of the film is done nicely.
1360;I felt this film had a quiet flow from beginning to end, sudden patches of brilliantly delivered dialogue, and interesting characters who were neither over.
1361;Peter Sarsgaard's performance was outstanding, and his character's complexity was mesmerizing.
1362;"My favorite scene in the movie is set in the quarry, when the 3 main characters stand atop an abandoned piece of equipment and shout into the ""infinite abyss"" before them, after which the awakened hero embraces and enfolds his lover in one of the most tender, realistic, and heartfelt kisses I've ever seen on film."
1363;"It was also quite unexpected and delightful to hear ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" by Simon and Garfunkel for the first time in decades."
1364;Not exactly original in concept, but carefully constructed, directed, and acted.
1365;Missed being a real masterpiece by inches.
1366;This movie is thought provoking and one of the BEST movies (and soundtracks) I have ever seen.
1367;What I found very profound was the plot lines concerning anti.
1368;depressants, disability and hidden family secrets.
1369;I've seen thousands of movies in my 35 years and can't remember another that touched these subjects in this subtle way.
1370;The scene with the kids on X. tasy was interesting.
1371;"the romance between the main characters was sweet and ""feel good"" with a slightly unexpected and non."
1372;that's where the joy is.
1373;But it's so much more than a message film.
1374;this is a deceptively simple story but it's so wise and so well told that it really touches the heart.
1375;I will look for his work in the future.
1376;Braff very skillfully walks the line between humour and pathos.
1377;The whole cast is super.
1378;It was great to see the wonderful Jean Smart in a small role, as the mom of his grave.
1379;much of the joy and magic of the film goes to Natalie Portman who plays the wonderfully screwy epileptic girl, Sam, who helps the Braff character come back to life.
1380;The role is well written but it could have been butchered in the hands of a lesser actress.
1381;Her naturalness really made the character touch your heart.
1382;This is the sign of a good actress and good direction.
1383;there's more I could say but there are a lot of excellent reviews here.
1384;I predict this film will become a classic, 'cuz it has such enduring qualities of real humanity, humour, wisdom and warmth.
1385;My favorite scene: the family watching the video of Sam ice.
1386;This was one of the cutest, most well.
1387;acted movies I have seen in a long time.
1388;But before I do something like that I always have to clear my head and go in story unknown.
1389;Having said that, this movie has a lot of character, which in turn makes each character more interesting.
1390;You've got yourself a good movie.
1391;All in all great film, it has rewatch value out of anything.
1392;Zack Braff did an awesome job.
1393;he maintained his somewhat quirky, humorous side, but also introduced his ability to take acting to a more serious level through his somewhat emotional and depressing character.
1394;She really captured her character and I can't imagine anyone else.
1395;Everyone should thoroughly enjoy the story and relate to it.
1396;In the end it makes me feel very happy.
1397;It's a romantic comedy with a bit of the darkness and irony of real life.
1398;The idiosyncrasies and eccentricities of the characters will make you laugh even more when you realize that they are basically just like everyone you know.
1399;It's a good story and a must.
1400;Some people thought it was 'ok' but for others it captures life itself.
1401;The thing i most enjoyed about the movie is the soundtrack.
1402;I recommend watching Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind if you're looking for a unique romance.
1403;As others have said, the soundtrack is one of the strongest points.
1404;(Not surprisingly, Zach Braff was also in charge of the soundtrack, and the cohesiveness of his vision is one of the reasons the movie is so good.)
1405;"Indeed, the whole thing has a ""genuine"" feel that lets you see the tragic and uplifting parts as equally touching."
1406;It brought even more depth to Andrew's character.
1407;"truly a movie for the ""lost"" generation."
1408;Blame this in part on my being on the other side of the generation gap.
1409;"there is a tremendous heart to this film, characterized when Braff, Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard's characters both literally and metaphorically unleash a scream into the ""eternal abyss."""
1410;determination, we risk blinding ourselves to the great redeeming aspect of our existance: the love of the people around us.
1411;natalie Portman as Largeman's girlfriend, Sam, is utterly luminous here.
1412;your spiritual daughter and future heir is growing up quite nicely.
1413;"the film's great heroic act belongs to Sarsgaard's character who leads Largeman and Sam on a bizarre odyssey through the small town's seamy underbelly in quest of an equally bizarre ""gift"" for Largeman."
1414;His gift becomes an understated but moving act of redemption.
1415;The fact that each of us posesses the power to in some way redeem one another is the movie's great hope.
1416;And a whole lot larger.
1417;Garden State is a smart, well acted movie.
1418;Incredibly impressive that Braff wrote, starred in and directed it.
1419;I didnt get the opening sequence, but by the end of the movie i finally got it all.
1420;the tone of the movie, the photography and the acting are really good, Natalie Portman standing out (As usual!!!)
1421;The humor is candid and the script is nothing less than beautiful and smart.
1422;This movie is about coming to terms with our lives, living the moment and taking life for what it is.
1423;And there, dear friends, is where its beauty lies.
1424;Watched it with a friend.
1425;Has a lot of subtle funny things and overall it's intelligent and well done.
1426;Watch this movie and take a drink every time Zach's face is full frame looking straight ahead past the camera with a blank expression on his face.
1427;It was an interesting movie.
1428;I mainly bought it for Amy Ferguson's brief appearance and stayed for the rest.
1429;"The central character is a bit actor living in California (his big claim to fame is having played a ""retarded football player"", so lets just call him ""retardoactor""), who earns his living as a fake Vietnamese waiter in an oriental restaurant."
1430;The most amazing thing in the whole movie is that he actually goes home to New Jersey for the burial .
1431;"His ""best friend"" is a pot and meth or crack smoking fellow who we find out earns money for his drugs from shoplifting and stealing the jewelry from the corpses of the people he buries."
1432;His is the success story in the movie.
1433;There's great acting by Natalie Portman and Zach Braff who also wrote and directed the movie.
1434;I recommend this movie because we all don't know how to handle life sometimes.
1435;After watching this you will definitely have food for thought afterwards.
1436;"This is one to rival ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" as one to watch over and over."
1437;A call from his father (Ian Holm) and Andrew is on a plane headed back to New Jersey for his Mom's funeral.
1438;while exploring his old home, Andrew gets caught back up in the party scene with his old friends.
1439;Some have grown up and moved on to other careers.
1440;It's a far deeper comedy than I would have expected and also has some excellent numbers for the soundtrack.
1441;They will have you laughing until you've got tears in your eyes.
1442;Garden State is a heady combination of innocence, saccharine sweetness, indifference, and inexpertise that never quite jells into a finished product.
1443;He's got nothing better to do, and so commences the strange round of reconnections with friends, family, acquaintances and strangers.
1444;while he's at the doctor's, Andrew meets a local girl, Sam.
1445;They begin spending a lot of time together.
1446;admitted pathological liar, lives with her mother in a cloyingly pink house, and harbors her own medical history.
1447;"She usually accompanies her stories with gems of advice like ""You always have to laugh at yourself"" and ""Life is what it is."""
1448;a tribute to the genuineness of the girl herself.
1449;A junkyard owner living at the bottom of a quarry turns out to embody wholesome family values.
1450;I gave it 2 stars because Natalie Portman is really cute.
1451;in addition to scenes of real warmth and tenderness scenes that brought me to tears.
1452;a gem of a movie.
1453;much like the well done spotless mind movie jim carrie handled so well.
1454;and i was quite happy to enter the garden state and go along for the ride !!!
1455;this more than qualifies and has many laughs along the way.
1456;braff is an intelligent funny guy.
1457;he wrote a great little script here.
1458;what it does have is great ensemble players inhabiting convincing if quirky( its a movie !!! )
1459;characters bringing them to life with all the wit and charm of its auteur !
1460;good thanks to the brilliance of james mason and shelley winters.
1461;2001 and the funny bomb one.
1462;but he wasnt into creating charmng witty heartwarming movies and couldnt if he wanted to !
1463;aha but it is new !
1464;delivers the goods in spades !!
1465;jean smart brings her usual sexy brilliance to the set with her.
1466;another well wrought character in his own right.
1467;a movie that is so underrated in my opinion.
1468;all in all a real surprise of a movie.
1469;that thanks to people w vision and the great gifts necesasary to get something like this done !
1470;kudos to the producers for knowing what a real gem this whole idea of mr braffs was.
1471;u just need one good scene to make a decent movie.
1472;2 or 3 and its something special.
1473;well this is a pearl necklace.
1474;for those with ears and eyes and sensibilities still intact and not driven into the numb oblivion our culture can deliver so many of us too to.
1475;but thats another movie !
1476;this movie is a delight .
1477;but its a funny tear jerking ride i thoroughly enjoyed.
1478;Like so many movies involving a trip home, this one becomes a journey of self.
1479;depressants so that he can feel again, he meets a charming yet quirky girl who has her own set of problems.
1480;plot in a movie is not the same as execution, but luckily the film is executed marvelously, maintaining a perfect balance between funny but quirky weirdness and emotional authenticity.
1481;The film is full of laughs, but it is much more than just a collection of laughs.
1482;All in all, it is a very impressive movie.You have to love what Zach Braff did in this film.
1483;What is remarkable is how well he managed all three.
1484;I think if he manages to stay within the range of that fundamental likeability as an actor, he is going to have a remarkable career.
1485;The general feeling is that next year will be the last for SCRUBS, which while a great vehicle for Braff is probably keeping him from the movie career that beckons.
1486;I hope that at some point he returns as well to both writing and directing.
1487;natalie Portman is enjoyable in her role as Sam, the epileptic girl he meets and falls in love with.
1488;This isn't one of her most impressive performances to date, but it is further evidence of her considerable talent.
1489;I'm very anxious to see what she does from here on out.
1490;gARDEN STATE contains one of the most celebrated soundtracks of recent years and it isn't an accident that it has enjoyed considerable success on its own.
1491;It is a very well chosen selection.
1492;I've often wondered how much of a role, if any, he plays in the music selection of music on SCBUBS, which has some of the best music of any show on TV.
1493;all in all, this is a superb movie.
1494;If you like intelligent, serious yet eccentric comedy, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.
1495;The actors do a wonderful job and really pull you right in.
1496;It makes you laugh and cry (in a good way) throughout the story.
1497;I stongly recommend this movie to everyone.
1498;zach Braff is actually given that role.
1499;"****1/2""Garden State"" is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy."
1500;Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.
1501;As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.
1502;"it's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience ""Garden State"" turns out to be."
1503;It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it.
1504;or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman.
1505;What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do.
1506;He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them.
1507;The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.
1508;consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good.
1509;He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end.
1510;In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.
1511;"Garden State provides a subtle little homage to ""The Graduate"" in its closing line ."
1512;a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema.
1513;"But ""Garden State"" is a visionary film in its own right as well."
1514;this is Natalie Portman's best performance yet.
1515;I thought this movie was really boring and I almost turned it off, but I thought the person I was watching it with liked it.
1516;"I hear it's a great coming of age story
1517;I hear it's a great story about someone moving forward with their life"
1518;it had the most wonderful story line, and an interesting plot.
1519;a romance, comedy, and drama all into one simple yet powerfilm.
1520;Garden State is an amazing movie.
1521;on a side note, the soundtrack is amazing.
1522;What go me the hardest was the innocence amidst such tribulations, in a town he left a long time ago, he finds himself imediately immersed in serious things, but soon thereafter meets Sam (Portman) and through the movie you can see her innocence affecting him.
1523;There is real emotional developement to this.
1524;All the stages are there, they don't just hop in bed and immediately love each other.
1525;there isnt a person that can tell me that is always how it works in real life.
1526;this is a good, real depiction.
1527;What I'll say is that the plot is a familiar one and I was dissappointed by that fact.
1528;The cast is pretty stellar.
1529;natalie Portman gives a top notch performance.
1530;He is such a great actor.
1531;highlights though were Peter Skarsgaard (sorry folks, have to mention him again), the scene where they went in search of the going away gift for Andrew, and the soundtrack is spectacular.
1532;"Over all it's really an impressive effort from first timer
1533;I just loved this movie all together"
1534;I felt so draw to each part as it just gets better and better.
1535;"They become close friends in little than a day
1536;I found this film to be highly enjoyable, I think any age group will find it more than a """"Been their, Seen that"""" It will open your eyes."""
1537;is essentially a beautifully shot, well.
1538;acted movie that makes fairly conventional themes (death, love, angst) fresh through its youthful, unabashed, ironic playfulness and earns a sentimental ending through its characters and script.
1539;This is helped immensely by a superb soundtrack and assured performances by both Natalie Portman and Zach Braff, who pulls off an unlikely feat in not only writing and directing but also starring in his own feature film.
1540;But it's funny and romantic without being a romantic comedy, sweet without being sappy, and for me, at least, that's more than enough.
1541;This movie is absolutely amazing.
1542;The story line is so simple yet so beautiful.
1543;i find it amazing that Zack Braff has the talent to not only write but also direct and star in this movie.
1544;Don't expect an amazing plot or anything but do expect to feel as though you can relate to everything in this movie, I feel as though i can connect to the characters more than any movie I have ever seen.
1545;I love how everything in the movie is filmed.
1546;The shots are constructed and carried out beautifully.
1547;The plot sometimes leaves you wondering what's next but it was still an original and beautiful film about the sometimes cruel ups and downs of life and starting over.
1548;I thought Natalie's Portman's portrayal of Sam was brilliantly acted and shows much potential.
1549;medicated young man who comes to terms with the tragedy in his life and finds love.
1550;His supporting characters are interesting and totally believeable, adding to the overall charm of the film.
1551;The soundtrack was perfect and coordinates beautifully with the story.
1552;To sum it up: touching, real and refreshingly original.
1553;Best movie I've seen in years.
1554;Its just another twnetysomething angst/finding love story.
1555;It has that im awake but still dreaming kind of feel.
1556;The film however is easy to watch and really is visually stunning.
1557;each one worth about half a second of chuckling.
1558;on a positive note, I have to say this movie has really opened my eyes on how to rate movies.
1559;It makes it so much easier!
1560;Yeah, I bet that's it.
1561;successful actor now reduced to waiting tables in a Vietnamese restaurant.
1562;See through the romantic plot and you have one and a half hours of entertainment wrapped in clever dialogues and clever humor.
1563;Braff has good sense of detail wich makes this one of the most intelligent movies I've seen lately.
1564;As a film fan, this is a quirky, funny, heart.
1565;wrenching movie that is as rewarding as can be.
1566;Usually, characters who are eccentric and a little odd come off as phony or are forced or over the top, but her portrayal was sweet, honest, and arresting.
1567;Plus the soundtrack is the best I've heard since the Crow.
1568;The overall result was not bad at all, since even though I did not feel strongly identified with the characters, I got to see an interesting story that is mostly driven by its well.
1569;He was relatively successful at first, but things cooled down and now he is working as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant.
1570;Now he has to go back home to New Jersey and face the world he left behind, including his friends and family.
1571;"In the process, he meets Sam (Portman) who has issues of her own
1572;zach Braff undoubtedly meets expectations in his debut as a director and writer, with an engaging script and a well.
1573;His performance as Andrew is inspired and completely believable"
1574;These two guys are complemented by an array of colorful characters that add spice to this film.
1575;The result is a production that is filled with funny situations and that has a considerable degree of emotions involved.
1576;Peter Sarsgard's perfomance is particularly good, and Portman also does well in her hopeful effort to break away from wooden Star Wars roles.
1577;(But it also had terrific soundtrack to help it along.)
1578;And you know the story: quirky boy or girl in quirky unexpected plots filled with quirky friends, with lots of dead stares (usually one or two from a couch) suggesting some kind of existential void that will be filled by movie's end (inadequately of course, since that is Life, but recognizing that fact is itself a victory .
1579;but director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive.
1580;"the humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain ""detour"" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant."
1581;even if it doesn't click with you it is a very enjoyable story.
1582;Braff and the crew are give a splendid performance and kudos to him for pulling this off on his first go.
1583;I'm one of the most open.
1584;But never have I seen something advertised as a beautiful, sensitive film about self.
1585;Not only is he a great director and writer, but a great actor as well.
1586;The movie is funny and serious, a nice balance.
1587;Braff really knows what he is doing.
1588;Garden State to me is a twisted and warped but amazingly beautiful fairy tale.
1589;That is until he meets Sam.
1590;Sam and Andrew fall in love and Sam teaches him that life is all you've got so you better make the most of it.
1591;the visuals in the movie are awesome as is the dialog.
1592;Zach Braff knows exactly how to make the perfect movie.
1593;I love his acting but I hope he goes on the write and direct a lot more movies.
1594;I found the movie quite wonderful!
1595;I ended up suggesting it to friends and family.
1596;"You really do have to be in the right mood to watch it and have to have the more, what I call, an artistic mind, or enjoy the ""thinker"" movies."
1597;But, I also enjoyed Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind.
1598;I love how this movie focuses on the relationship that builds between two incredibly odd people.
1599;The movie has a great soundtrack that is perfectly woven into each scene like inTime and Tide.
1600;Watch this movie and get the soundtrack.
1601;You might be shocked, but J. d. from Scrubs can actually write and direct a memorable and touching movie.
1602;I wouldn't call it a typical love story, but it is a great movie to share with one you love
1603;I found this movie entertaining and quirky, but overdone.
1604;Because it was his first film, he should have stuck with one of these aspects and developed it, rather than trying to do everything right and complete.
1605;He is adorable and Portman is irresistable, though.
1606;It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro.
1607;"The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots ""well"" than making a decent movie."
1608;This is a great film, especially considering it's Braff's first attempt at writing and direction.
1609;It also has some funny laugh out loud moments, so you get a good mix of emotions in the one film.
1610;What's more it has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film for ages.
1611;Well worth giving a go!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1612;So great, the music is fantasticacme Zac braff knows how to male great films.
1613;Truly a classic movie for our generation
1614;Zach Braff has hit his stride in this movie, proving not only his diversity as an actor, but his brilliance as both a writer and a director.
1615;This movie has three dimensional characters who you can tell were painstakingly crafted, a simple but extremely emotional plot and a story that speaks volumes in our generation's quest to feel something real.
1616;and the soundtrack is equally as good!
1617;This film is one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time, it speaks to me in many ways.
1618;I recommend this film to anyone that is still confused on what to do in life this will give you a little guidiance and if not at least youll get a great night of entertainment.
1619;Zack Braff directorial debut is stunning.
1620;This film quirky charm and artsy cinematography takes you through the transformation of Andrew Largeman(Braff), a drugged up second.
1621;He returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral and reunites with some of his high school friends.
1622;He also finds love during his visit in the sweet but idiosyncratic, Sam, played by Natalie Portman.
1623;Portman was absolutely spectacular in this role and her performance was fantastic.
1624;This film is a perseptional masterpiece.
1625;"Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" is a small and simple tale about a pair of lonely souls finding happiness in each other's company."
1626;establish his relationship with his son but Andrew chooses to keep company with his circle of old friends instead.
1627;As their relationship develops, Andrew finds the courage to come to grips with his tragic past.
1628;"the success of ""Garden State"" is due primarily to the three performances at the center of the story."
1629;Zach Braff gives just the right touch of poignancy to Andrew and Peter Sarsgaard brings a likeable, roguish charm to Mark, one of Andrew's old friends.
1630;It is Portman, however, that shines the brightest.
1631;Her offbeat and touching performance gives the film its eccentric identity.
1632;"While the melodrama in ""Garden State"" gets a little too heavy at spots, its universal story about moving on with one's life still is told well enough to make the film worthy of a viewing."
1633;It was in the original packaging and is in excellent condition.
1634;I am very satisfied and I highly recommend this seller and product to everyone.
1635;This is a great movie!
1636;This was my favorite film of 2004, and i almost never saw it.
1637;It's a movie so powerful that, even as you're not commited to watching it, it grasps you and pulls you in.
1638;key energy spread throughout Garden State that makes it a quietly special film.
1639;Here he meets Sam (Natalie Portman, wonderful in this role), who is full of everything he is not: emotion, energy, life.
1640;Peter Sarsgaard costars and is terrific as well.
1641;The stirring film captures Largeman's journey back to life's surface as he deals with pain, joy, and anger in real ways for the first time.
1642;This movie is deep and heartfelt with superb acting and directing.
1643;It only takes place over a few days but it sucks you right in.
1644;The soundtrack definately improves my rating from 4 to 5 stars.
1645;The songs were perfect for each part in their movie .
1646;"This is a sweet little film
1647;I want to say it's all because of Natalie Portman's character and the eventual """"relationship"""" that evolves between her and Andrew that makes this film work, and I believe it to be true."""
1648;I just adore this couple's chemistry and the truly real way they connect.
1649;"But because of the touching way Andrew begins to relate to Sam all is ""forgiven"", right?"
1650;"Zach Braff is extremely talented
1651;I watched it the first time and was pleasantly surprised.
1652;After my sister bought it, I began watching it constantly, finding new levels of depth within the layers that Zach Braff created.
1653;Zach Braff's work on the movie is truly astonishing.
1654;his humor, while subtle, compliments the movie and uses sarcasm as a tool to develop his character Andrew Largemen.
1655;worthy and shows depth in her acting abilities never readily seen before.
1656;I didn't know what to expect, but thought it would be a light romantic comedy and mildly entertaining.
1657;Instead I found it alternately heartbreaking and hilarious.
1658;I was moved to tears several times, and to side.
1659;It's a wonderfully entertaining and heartwarming film.
1660;a note to the masses: The great thing about this film is its simplicity.
1661;I LIKED this flick, but it isn't stunning.
1662;Interesting, worth seeing and keeping an eye on what Zach Braff does from here, but not worth raving about particularly.
1663;just because it is the kind of little story that is often done in many countries, but somehow this one is elevated because of its country of origin.
1664;hollywood American film is good by its difference.)
1665;There are a lot of foreign films (which this is for me) that can convey that with breathtaking results.
1666;that said, I thought a lot of the writing was good and how it was put together.
1667;probably people do get locked into apathy and ennui by medication, but is true happiness just a matter of stopping?
1668;see it, but keep it in context.
1669;garden state is officially my new favorite movie.
1670;zach braff does an amazing job with writing and directing this coming of age story.
1671;natalie portman stunned me with a stellar performance.
1672;she is an amazing actress.
1673;natalie portman has a huge range.
1674;the movie was hilarious, the soundtrack kicks major [.]
1675;Well, in a way it reminded me of one of my other favorite movies also featuring Natalie Portman.
1676;Beautiful Girls (if you haven't seen it.
1677;of course, this is a great story.
1678;I mean, it's so human.
1679;It's the past in this movie that really keeps it flowing.
1680;really give Oscar worthy performances.
1681;other than they were so real.
1682;I think Zack deserves to at least be nominated for an Oscar for such a well.
1683;out, well put together, funny, sad and interesting movie.
1684;The music was also chosen perfectly to fit and the cinematography gave the film a very artsy feel.
1685;goers will enjoy the movie and it's story.
1686;Because it's a story with a lot of heart.
1687;If you like movies that make you fall asleep and uses bad language then get this but otherwise it sucks!
1688;I would rather give this 0 stars if I could!
1689;They are very worth while and you learn a tremendous amount about the movie and why things ocurred.
1690;Overall, this is the best movie I have seen in a very long time and would encourage everyone to watch it.
1691;It will definitely change your life.
1692;He finds himself at home for the first time in years meeting old friends and making new ones, in particular Sam (Portman).
1693;The relationship between father and son is also enjoyable to watch, raising questions on just how much control a father should have.

1697;Braff is best known for his starring role as J. d. in the television comi.
1698;The film is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a great directorial debut.
1699;The film has several shots that just in and of themselves are pure art"
1700;There are also several interesting filmmaking techniques incorporating throughout the picture that shake up the pace and keep things interesting.
1701;But the heart of the movie is the meaning behind it all.
1702;Large's life is like millions of people throughout the country.
1703;he has just been existing in a dream.
1704;enhanced state since the time he was a child.
1705;Add in a mix of a beautiful soundtrack (Braff was also the soundtrack producer) and some high.
1706;Garden State has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1707;It's got good writing, a true to life storyline, believable characters, and that something else.
1708;You can really relate with the characters and the story.
1709;That's Garden State and it's an excellent movie.
1710;And his job is fantastic.
1711;There he is faced with a lot of things, namely his dad (Ian Holm), who has had him on numbing medication for most of his life.
1712;"There, one day in the doctor's surgery after a party at his friend's house, he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a quirky girl with a love for The Shins, lying and doing things that are ""totally unique""."
1713;The rest is yours to discover.
1714;It's sweet and endearing, but funny and real at the same time.
1715;there are some great visual sequences in the film and I give Braff credit for his cinomatic eye.
1716;"My viewing of Garden State was pure happenstance, I went to see one film and changed my mind once I got to the theatre
1717;i loved this movie probably more than I should"
1718;the acting is brilliant, real, and heartfelt (welcome back Natalie, Peter brilliant as ever, Zach you are so much more than a loveable clown), the script witty and smart, the cinematography, beautiful and the composition of some of the scenes are astounding considering this is Braff's first feature film.
1719;the story is simple .
1720;the redemptive power of choosing to live ones life .
1721;There is so much power in that choice, to live life without reserve, without fear of failure, without the fear of giving and receiving love.
1722;an impressive debut Mr. Braff, thank you.
1723;This movie has some very funny and enlightening moments in a movie that isn't exactly fantasy or reality.

1729;She's versatile and full of life and bubbling with humor.
1730;It's just that its done so lovingly, with great care and craftsmanship.
1731;He's done that, and this one will last as a favorite just as Say Anything or Heathers or Edward Scissorhands has.
1732;And yes, the soundtrack is great, setting the mood and tone of humor perfectly.
1733;This movie has a huge following in my highschool, and i think it's because you can especially identify with it, being a teenager.
1734;It's one of those rare movies that knows how to show all the random feelings and images that represent confusion, solidarity, numbness, and also compassion.
1735;This movie just shows that, and it's in it's own category because of it.
1736;Some create alternative realities with drugs and parties, and some just dream of what could be.
1737;His nostalgia is for a home he never knew and joy he never felt.
1738;She promises the rewards of non.
1739;stealer, Portman's irresistible performance will remind viewers of her break.
1740;portman's livewire Sam fits nicely in this sometimes somber and slow.

1743;garden state is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.
1744;garden state is a beautiful rendition of events that could actually happen and change your life.
1745;the characters are real and rather than explosives and special effects, garden state focuses on lifes real meaning, love.
1746;I had to travel about 45 minutes to go see it and I am so happy I did.

1756;It's got a little bit of everything and it's just an overall great movie.
1757;"The fact that high school kids think it's so ""deep"" baffles me."
1758;The only think appreciatable about this film is the decent cinematography in the first 20 mins.
1759;Whenever I watch a movie, I ask myself this question.
1760;There is nothing sympathetic about story's hero Andrew.
1761;Her presence is the only saving grace.
