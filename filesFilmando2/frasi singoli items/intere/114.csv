1;Gladiator is the best movie I have ever seen.
2;I was so impressed with the story, cinematography, acting, and special effects that when combined witht the action scenes and the attention to historical detail in Roman culture.
3;It is a powerful movie too.
4;It is a wonderful story about love, honor, revenge, and betrayal.
5;The bonus disk that comes in addition to the movie is superb and very insightful.
6;A 5 Star sword and sandal summertime blockbuster fantasy/action flick and classic morality tale.
7;Except for the realistic fight scenes!
8;crafted morality tale of honor, loyalty, and betrayal with some cool fights.
9;Director Ridley Scott has brought to us some of the most gorgeous films of the last 30+ years.
10;If you don't own this yet, please ADD TO CART now.
11;com> for which I wholey trust and respect the opinion of Bill Hunt, editor.
12;A screenshot represents 1/24 of a second of film.
13;no matter how well intentioned .
14;hand, in context, in full motion, presented on proper equipment.
15;I was able to pick up the discs this morning, and I've since gone through the transfers in some detail.
16;I'll do that in more detail next week, and I can tell you with confidence that the extras on both discs are absolutely first.
17;Color and contrast is fine at all times.
18;The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital.
19;The extended edition scenes, however, look fine .
20;In this Gladiator transfer, you can see it in the image.
21;arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next.
22;ray is quite watchable .
23;score in the 18.19 range.
24;So while this disc is watchable, that's just not good enough, either for the format as a whole or for most fans and enthusiasts
25;the great idea was Rome .
26;a man of courage and honor .
27;rise against the mighty Roman power and rescue mankind's greatest and grandest dream from remaining a dream forever?This is what Gladiator, a magnificent, dramatic and compelling epic is all about.
28;Gladiator is unabashedly concerned with the projection of a positive hero whose stature remains undiluted to the very end.
29;the performance by every character in the film, particularly Russell Crowe, is wonderful.
30;it has profoundly and undeniably important philosophical.
31;this combination of a historic perspective with a definite political viewpoint
32;biting,terrific and terrifying story .
33;this superb combination makes Gladiator one of the best films of the recent times.
34;I found it to be one of the best movies I had seen in a while.
35;It was brilliant in its mastery of reinacting the life of a gladiator and furthermore it had some of the most powerful speeches and thought provoking ideas that I have heard since braveheart.
36;Great depiction of roman politics and war as it was in the day.
37;The best scenes, in my opinion, were such simply because of the difficulty of the production.
38;there are plenty of fine films that have already been made.
39;good set design and costume dosen't make a good movie.
40;Want to see a good movie with elabourate sets and costume?
41;Want to see a good 'journey of the hero' movie?
42;In the Movie the claim is that he is from Spain.
43;So can someone help me here please.
44;The battle scene at the beginning of the film is so impressive and realistic it will give you chills.
45;From watching how the Roman soldiers are assembled on the battlefield to how they devastate their enemy, every sequence is done with historical accuracy.
46;It gives you a true sense of what made the Roman Empire so powerful.
47;The story is tremendously gripping and sucks you into Maximus' (the main character) life in such a way that you feel vindicated at the movie's climax.
48;Gladiator is one of my all time favorite movies and I honestly can't wait to own this 2 disk collection.
49;Original and haunting at the same time.
50;The tension and suspence are timed perfect with the pace of the film.
51;Amazing is a good description!
52;Kudos to the Director of Photography.
53;so he gives the job to the general privately.
54;this is true by the way.
55;some even involving tigers!he becomes a big sensation with the people.
56;a cool quote iswe're all just shadows and dust,maximus.
57;its a bit long but action packed.
58;I received this movie on time and packaging was in excellent condition.
59;I was pleasantly surprised to see that this Gladiator stands on its own two feet quite well.
60;Russell Crowe is appropriately meloncholy, and you can really cheer for his battle to regain the dignity taken from him.
61;You'll be at the edge of your seat wondering how the players will resolve their conflicts until the last bittersweet moment.
62;Definitely one of the best written movies of the year.
63;The days of the Roman Empire were brought to life in full color and sound, and for a short time I was allowed the priviledge of living in one of the most exciting times in world history.
64;old struggle between good and evil, and when all the odds were seemingly against him, he eventually emerged victorious.
65;My girlfriend also enjoyed the movie immensely, and she reflects upon it from time to time.
66;It is now one of our treasured topics of discussion, and to be able to share such precious intellectual time with a loved one is priceless.
67;Gladiator is destined to become a cinema classic.
68;There is so much happening that is beautiful.
69;There is so much happening that provokes thought.
70;I will enjoy this first viewing for what it's worth, and then I must see this again.
71;Then flowed the rivers of blood and fire and brightly colored banners.
72;a general who loves a king, a king who loves his sister, a slave who defies his heart and his master, but keeps his promise.
73;As a teacher of English and a student of the language, I love this one.
74;The film shows Imperial Rome winning a battle in the Black Forest.
75;after the battle we see some high level intrigue among the leaders.
76;Handing power to a popular military leader is the antithesis of a republic!
77;Like many other films, the action picks up when the story line lags.
78;This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time.
79;After winning a great battle against the barbarians, the old king, Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), decides to make this brilliant general the Caesar of Rome upon his death.
80;He orders Maximus and his wife and son killed.
81;After he escapes, he is captured by a man who organizes gladiator fights to turn a profit.
82;Maximus was to participate in one of these events
83;Not only by staying alive did he achieve victory, but he also won over the crowd.
84;The acting is excellent all around, especially Crowe and Phoenix.
85;The scenery and costumes are all outstanding, bringing the Roman Empire to life.
86;This movie is nothing less than a classic
87;It is definitely worth purchasing here.
88;a fine combination of literate messagery and light entertainment.
89;My friend who is really into movies kept on telling me to see it.
90;Afterwards I was like wow what a great movie.
91;In all the commercials about the movie they portrayed it as being an action packed movie and being basically a guy movie.
92;The plot of this movie is the best part.
93;The action seen are great but the plot is by far the best i have ever seen.
94;It is my new #1 movie.
95;This movie has everything action, drama, suspence, and an A++ story line.
96;This movie should go down in history as one of the best ever.
97;This movie is one of the best films I have seen this year!
98;The visual effects of this movie are outstanding, but nothing can compare to Star Wars Episode I.
99;The movie mainly talks about Russell Crowe, (I forgot his name) who starts out having a wife and a son, and is apart of a war, which he and his men win.
100;Once the Gladiator wins the fights, he finally arrives in the Coliseum, and does a lot of fighting against man and beast.
101;The king is very jealous that the Gladiator is winning all these fights, and finally, at the end of the movie, fights him, and ofcourse, looses, and dies.
102;The really awesome thing about this movie is the visual effects, the action, and the acting
103;Maximus is a man troubled with loves past and desires nothing but to go home once the barbarians are destroyed.
104;What starts out as a terrific victory, Gladiator follows Maximus' decent from the heights of high protector of Rome, to a slave in chains.
105;The acting and plot is combined brilliantly by Ridley Scott to make this movie one of a kind.
106;This is a legendary film.
107;ray, you really feel like you are a part of the action.
108;Everything about this movie is stunning, but especially in Blu.
109;The only way to some up this movie is to state how soon it shal be considered a classic.
110;The actions scenes are realisiticly intriguing and it is exciting to watch.
111;Hans Zimmer's music is perfect, along with Russel Crowe.
112;It was nice seeing Oliver Reed (R. i. p), and Richard Harris in action again.
113;And the score by Hans Zimmer was simply sublime.
114;The movie Gladiator is a good one and has a good plot.
115;The movie has a good plot and keeps you on your toes.
116;The battle scenes are great and so are the backstabbing liars in this movie.
117;Many people have their heads cut off and you can see their heads laying on the ground.
118;This is another reason I rated it four stars.
119;The production of the movie is fine, but I am not understanding what is this movie going to tell me.
120;It incorperated many fantasy aspects as well, and the part i like most about this movie is the ending isn't what you would expect.
121;the special effects are great, the storyline flows well, acting is supurb, everything is just magnificent!
122;you must see this epic film.
123;I thoguht it was a great movie, though.
124;Gladiator made my eyes water not much with sadness, but at the beauty of this remarkable storyline of strength, honor, betrayal, and the fall of both the hero as well as the villain.
125;This one's a keeper and a treasure in anyone's movie collection.
126;This is clearly the best film Ridley Scott has ever directed, and I think in his heart, he knows this.
127;Watch this one without expecting it to totally change your life, and you will see the reason for most of the good reviews.
128;The amazing visually effects made possible the breathtaking grandeur of Rome, specially in its beating hard, the Coliseum, shown as it had never been seen before, the 360 degrees shot of the Gladiators entering the Arena is the visual climax of the film.
129;Russell Crowe brings freshness to the all to used classic Hero (who's unbreakable in his believes of moral and honor), wining the Academy Award for Best Actor (even though Crowe's performance is excellent, his character was the most simple of the nominees, there for, he didn't deserved the praise).
130;The supporting cast shines also, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, also brings something fresh to the also all to used pusillanimous villain.
131;A short appearance by the late Richard Harris (one of his last films), in the indispensable Marcus Aurelius role, gives elegance to the cast, the also late Oliver Reed, brings sharpness to his last role: Proximo.
132;maybe not the best film of 2000, Gladiator is a great visual experience, certainly one of the best films of its year, and a great come back for the genre.
133;and so too with Gladiator does Scott Co. involved triumphantly deliver the moviegoer the good's transporting us successfully to the first grand (sand,sandal toga) tale for over some thirty years.
134;A captivating cinema going experience with first.
135;budget hollywood extravaganza at it's very best filled in with glorius cinematography and effects work, stirring musical score and effective screenplay populated with acting pool talent ensemble and in my opinion Ridley Scott's latest and best directorial effort to date.
136;GLADIATOR is epic movie story.
137;telling brought thrillingly into the 21st century by a film.
138;Its a simple plot, brilliantly executed.
139;I liked the way Russell Crowe played the character .
140;But I suppose everyone knows that by now.
141;the emperor, on the other hand, was also acted well.
142;I am really not a fan of blood, guts, testosterone driven movies, but I do love this movie.
143;But I can respect the people who care enough complain and boycott just for the principal of the thing.
144;braveheart, on the other hand, is absolutely one of the best blu.
145;rays I've ever seen, and worth collecting if you're a collector or cinematic awesomeness.
146;I absolutely love this movie and it just came in, and I opened it today.
147;I am still watching it as we speak because I love the movie so much but I'm pretty upset that the frames are messed up.
148;Bottom line: you may get a Gladiator movie that works good, you may not.
149;This is great historic license in a time where historical records abound.
150;Gladiator has to be the best sandal and sword epic ever made!
151;even though Gladiator is a send up of those past Hollywood mega productions the main difference is Russell Crowe his raw energy and stocky apperance lend a natural flow to the believability of the film.
152;The direction by Scott is breathtaking i have never been a fan of his due to the fact in almost all Scott's movies outside of Thelma and Louise all the characters seem under developed and the main attraction is the violence but here there is a brilliant balance!
153;But thanks to great acting by the ENTIRE cast never once is the fighting or personal strife unnatural.
154;The cinematography is also great.
155;And I will name my first son Arelius because of this movie alone.
156;or learn good film making .
157;The story was good and cast of characters were put together well.
158;This film is good, but it is no Braveheart.
159;This said, the movie fulfills it's most important task: It is entertaining.
160;There is a lot of action, which looks good, (although again, the scene with the tigers features to much CGI at times) the acting is okay, with a splendid last performance by Oliver Reed and the costumes are a feast for the eyes.
161;If you thought the archers' scene in Robin Hood Prince of Theives was a good one, you'll love how this movie opens up although it's a couple of shades darker.
162;the heart of this movie is the jouney of a man named Maximus .
163;the acting performances are absolutely superb, as is the story.
164;Richard Harris' brief role is also a memorable performance.
165;the cinematagraphy is splendid as is Hans Zimmer's musical score.
166;Rousing fight scenes(watch out for those tigers)
167;rUSSELL CROWE is ideally cast,what else can i guy want?Maybe a virtual collesium can convince you that this is actually ROME.
168;well, sometimes they do, but curiously we discover that we didn't missed them that much.
169;Gladiator is one of those movies that doesn't just stun and amaze you, but adds something significant to its genre.
170;In Gladiator's case, it's in the action scenes.
171;Along with some camera techniques that I can't begin to describe, this makes for possibly the most visceral and engaging action sequences since, well, Seven Samurai.
172;As for the story, it is surprisingly well done, and while many discredit the movie for its historical inaccuracy, it is sure a whole lot more historically accurate than say, The Patriot.
173;Actors are generally strong from the indomitable, electrifying Crowe to the loasthome yet, admittedly, effective Phoenix.
174;A broad range of realistic characters is well represented here.
175;The musical score is stirring, ominous, and, when necessary, complements the action very nicely.
176;Definitely for those who have been starved for some really engaging swords.
177;The battles, I'll admit, are slightly gory, but who really cares when it's the most stunning masterpiece of our time.
178;And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
179;best quote from any movie I've seen to date!
180;After watching it a second time, however, it became my favorite movie of all time and that still holds true today almost 10 years removed.
181;The real story is Maximus' enduring honor, pride, and devotion to family, country and his morals.
182;Great production
183;What can I say, this is the best movie I have ever seen, when I saw the trailer on t. v I knew it was going to be a box.
184;office hit at least, but when I saw the movie, just for the first scene, the Battle, I knew this was the best movie of the year and the best movie yet.
185;But lets talk Gladiator, Russell Crowe is great, no wander he won the Oscar for his performance, I would have lost all my respect to the award if he didn't.
186;The rest of the cast is also wonderful, specially the late Oliver Reed, too bad we lost this great actor, he may had won the Oscar for this performance.
187;And the soundtrack is another proof that Hans Zimmer is a genius.
188;These movie, to me of course, in one of the best movies of these year, Russel is one best acor in this moment
189;This movie is a great action movie of the toga.
190;the true history of Commodus is much more exciting, imaginative and colorful than the trite story line we are given in this film.
191;the emperor Commodus was heavily muscled and bearded and considered a model of male beauty at that time.
192;the depiction of the gladiators, like all American productions relating to this period of history completely and purposefully distorts the facts of their daily life and exercise by censoring, hiding and refusing to allocate nudity and the strong presence of sexuality, both heterosexual and homoerotic that was part of that world.
193;When will we see that our present day ideas on the topic had NOTHING to do with the way these people lived??
194;all of the above taken into consideration, the movie is an entertaining, fast.
195;action fantasy that has escapist value.
196;Russell Crowe never looked better and he does do an extremely convincing characterization of a provincial, country.
197;loving, old fashioned virtuous and somewhat brutish Roman general of the type the Romans themselves always liked to praise with great respect.
198;gladiator pays homage to Spartacus, Ben.
199;The tone of the other films has some lighthearted parts.
200;However, two is hardly enough: Hamlet, a dark play by any standards, has some great laughs of all stripes.
201;gladiator is a good movie
202;Ridley Scott, who directed Gladiator, took some of the best elements in classic movies like Ben.
203;hur and Spartacus (the set designs, the big production values, the man.
204;man combats, the huge number of extras), and combined them with modern elements inspired by movies like Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan (the digital effects, the realism of the battles, the man fighting for his country and seeking for revenge).
205;Gladiator is a modern epic with good performances and good direction work.
206;The cast includes solid actors like Russell Crowe, who dominates his role, specially in the physical aspect where he really looks like a warrior.
207;Oliver Reed as Proximo, he also gave a memorable performance.
208;The sound and the music are very good, and it reflects in a more realistic movie.
209;Gladiator is a very good movie, it's a very good way to introduce younger audiences to a classic genre.
210;If you liked this movie, then you should see the classics, like Ben.
211;The movie is a little sad but, it had some good action scenes.
212;It's kind of like Braveheart.
213;If you liked braveheart you'll like this too.
214;It has two disk one for the movie and one for the special features.
215;Many of my friends and family had loved the amazing tail of Maximus and his journey to reek revenge on Commodus.
216;With superb acting and outrageous battle seens I would have to recommend this film to people of all ages.
217;Its definitely one of the best films of 2000.
218;The uniqueness of the story comes with the Roman setting which is breathtaking and realistic.
219;Russell Crowe leads a wonderful cast, including Joaquim Phoenix as his nemesis.
220;The performances are strong, the plot is good, and the action is intense.
221;Ridley Scott does his movie justice with this 2.
222;Keeps you on the edge of your seat
223;I loved this film when I heard Russel Crowe say on my singal unleash hell.
224;This movie for me was fun.
225;I enjoyed seeing the rise and fall and rise of Maximus the great.
226;It showed the strength of the human spirit and a man with a good soul will be able to be at peace with himself in the end of the day as Maximus was when he was dying.
227;My God it is an entertaing movie and with a great plot.
228;Some people watch movies for messages, I on the other hand watch movies to be entertained!
229;dISC label above the PARAMOUNT logo on the back of the slip cover.
230;Skin tone appear natural with good detail, especially Cassius robe and all the armors!
231;dISC label above the PARAMOUNT loge ON THE BACK OF THE SLIP COVER, give it a spin for a physical check!
232;One should be fine to order now.
233;I just set through the Extended 171 minutes version, and it was fantastic!
234;He's old enough to succeed (historically, that is).
235;Ridley Scott's film is beautifully mounted, and took enormous pains to present equisite details of ancient Roman life.
236;The acting by Crowe and Reed is especially outstanding.
237;great epic film about a former roman general turned gladiator by a corrupt ruler.
238;Intense fighting, memorable characters, and good soundtrack make this a must see.
239;stellar Film, Fine Features Make It a Home.
240;span guy like me found this meaty film downright riveting.
241;In a sense, this is the kind of epic 20th.
242;an epic scope, taut plotting, and performances worthy of the dialog: alongside Crowe, featured actors include the late Oliver Reed, the ever.
243;slithery Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus, and wonderful Derek Jacobi as the elderly Senator who views his nutso new emperor with the detachment of a patrician and the fear of someone worried about the common people's welfare.
244;thanks to computer animation and lots of graphic design, we are put in the middle of a quite realistic 50,000.
245;(The bells and whistles special.
246;generated imagery [CGI] played such a foundational role in it.)
247;And needless to say the scene when Maximus confronts Commodus, who had given him up for dead, is remarkable.
248;al allen smalling /This is just one wonderful flick!
249;First of all, this movie is pretty gory.
250;But make sure you tell the kiddies to go play with their barbies or something.
251;the best part of the movie is how it truly captures the terror of being a gladiator.
252;i though the movie overall was a good experience.
253;Gladiator is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
254;I loved it from start to finish.
255;Excellent movie, amazing, great actors and the amazon instant video works perfect!!
256;Gladiator is a sweeping epic I saw on the big screen.
257;When I went to the afternoon matinee,I enjoyed the spectacle of Roman warriors,political conspiracy,and Russell Crowe.
258;Gladiator isn't exactly deep (if you want a deep Ridley Scott movie,get Blade Runner instead)but it is good sword and sandal fun.
259;It also has a good message about defending family and freedom.
260;Russell Crowe is sexy as the lead,worthy muscular eye candy.
261;This was one of the best movies of 2000 from the battle for Germany lead by Maximus to the final battle between Maximus against Commodus the Emperor of Rome.
262;Australian Russell Crowe has done an outstanding performance as Maximus and I soon learned that he did his own stunts in that movie.
263;It truly deserved Oscars for being the #1 movie in America.
264;One star for powerful story, One star for great action, One star for brilliant acting by Russell Crowe, one star for spectacular visuals of Rome, and one star for all the hard work that Ridley Scott did to make this movie a success.5 stars is my rating and there is no good reason why you cannot rate this movie one star.
265;He is captured by a slaver who specializes in Gladiator fighting and Crowe (Maximus) becomes a Gladiator who eventually comes face to face with his enemy.
266;this is a great movie that I think you will enjoy and I absolutely love the costumes.
267;I cried and I got scared, it's full of emotions and battles at the same time.
268;Russel Crowe plays very good and he is very handsome and sexy in this movie.
269;It's powerful, action packed, and well.
270;Great directing by ridley scott (legend, bladerunner, G. i jane, thelma louise, Alien.)
271;(braveheart is a great movie too though).
272;now not only is the movie great, but the two.
273;Crowe is great, plot is great, music is great.
274;You respect Maximus as a leader and just feel for him as a person.
275;Really great hero done wrong flick and highly recommended.
276;Gladiator is a great film that has what all movies need: great acting, great plot, great sets and effects, all pulled together with that special flair that makes it a memorable viewing experience.
277;These scenes add some extra depth and dimension to the characters and the film over all that I valued enough to justify the added cost of this version.
278;otherwise the film is a ten star work of genius.
279;Ave atque vale, Oliver Reed!
280;There were a lot of surprises in this movie that I didn't expect!
281;Of course the movie itself is timeless and a classic.
282;Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience.
283;Great writing, great acting, no obvious cgi.
284;The story just draws you in from the start.
285;He was one of the finest directors (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend) and i hope he will be again after his more recent works (White Squall, G. i Jane).
286;The cinematography is wonderful, ranging from harsh to poetic.
287;The acting is without any minor failure, and the Soundtrack is one of the alltime best i've heard.
288;this movie is well deserved one to add to my Best Ever List , along with Blade Runner and My Neighbor Totoro.
289;ray version of Gladiator is spectacular!
290;The scenes in the Colosseum, especially during the re.
291;enactment of the battle of Carthage, are so vivid they are almost three.
292;By all means, get this one!
293;The costumes (which won an Oscar!)
294;It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called historical movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids.
295;Gladiator opens with a captivating and impressively filmed first scene.
296;The acting is captivating, and excellent, the special effects also excellent.
297;I will wait for this to be done right.
298;Phoenix was fantastic as the perverted, maniacal Comodus.
299;Crowe was utterly fantastic in his roll as Maximus.
300;The story held together from the opening sequences, and Scott's brilliant artistic direction made this an all.
301;It is so loaded with extras that it has a second disk for the special features.
302;Russell Crowe gives a stellar performance.
303;The movie is action packed and full of graphic fighting scenes.
304;This movie is about love, but the love that the trailers are refering to.
305;The love in this movie is Maximus' love for the old emporer and for his family.
306;The violence in the movie is extremely graphic, but the story line is terrific and it is wonderfully done with terrific acting and a great musical score by Hans Zimmer.
307;It is well worth the money.
308;IE: the one that looks pretty.
309;the steelbook case is nothing overtly special, but it is fairly cool for those interested.
310;The case was a nice bonus.
311;Made in the style of Cecile B DeMille type sweeping saga's it IS a very good movie, with a great script and wonderful performances all round, especially from Oliver Reed, in this his last movie.
312;Russell Crowe's performance is both powerful and believable, and the camera work is both stunning and inventive.
313;This is a good movie, but one can't help feeling that many viewers will find it somewhat protracted and a tad on the long side.
314;This was one of the most exilarating and action packed film that I have seen.
315;It has a very interesting storyline and shows how important the loss of a family is.
316;It has spectacular special effects and the digtal image of Comodus is very easily mistaken for an actual face, and I hadn't been told about the fact that Comodus had died during the filming I wouldn't have noticed the difference.
317;Great movie to begin with and great price for the blu ray.
318;This movie was really touching and hard to stop watching, even with blood flying and heads falling.
319;Anyway, I was impressed, as usual, with Russell Crowe, and Director Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing.
320;I watched this movie for the first time in Latin class, . . . The second time I saw it, it didn't seem nearly as bad and I really enjoyed the true message and meaning.
321;Gladiator was without a doubt the best movie that I have seen all year, and also the best that I have seen since Braveheart all the way back in 1995.
322;I would, because that's a nice connection!
323;You can really see how made.
324;up some of these stars are.
325;If they can make this picture better, I'd sure like to see it.
326;As always, see it with your own eyes and decide for yourself.
327;the first time i saw this i did fall aslepp but the second time i watched it i was amazed this is one of the best films ever made.
328;the directing and acting are amazing!
329;Have the power, strength, and wisdom to have all whole world, and the integrity to let it go.
330;Anyone who knows me knows my unwavering devotion to this film.
331;In fact it was this film that introduced me to the man I now consider a god among men so it will always hold a special place in my heart.
332;That aside though I can honestly say that `Gladiator' is a masterpiece of a film, from start to finish, utterly amazing to witness.
333;This of course is a result of the iconic performance by Russell Crowe who breathes so much life and realism into Maximus.
334;i've always been drawn to epics of this nature.
335;The swords and sandals type war films have always intrigued me and I can honestly say that I have yet to see one that reaches the grandeur that is `Gladiator'.
336;Maximus' life was going well for a time.
337;what Ridley Scott has done here is create for us a beautiful and intoxicating story of love, betrayal, devotion and revenge.
338;As `Gladiator' unfolds we watch the story of a man and his plight, his determination fueling our interest.
339;We develop our own loathing for Commodus (thanks in part to Joaquin Phoenix's fantastic performance) as well as our deepest sympathies for his beautiful sister Lucilla.
340;Lucilla has a lot at stake though.
341;Lucilla also has to detour her brothers sickening advances towards her in hopes of spawning a perfect heir.
342;russell Crowe delivers one of the most powerfully moving performances of his career (I'm still sticking by his `Insider' work as his finest) and definitely turns out the most impressive performance of the given year.
343;Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a spot on portrayal of the evil Commodus.
344;He perfectly captures the immaturity within Commodus' every move and that lies behind every motivation.
345;Connie Nielsen is wonderfully reserved as Lucilla.
346;With her restrained performance we can see the underlying emotion within her each and every step.
347;The supporting players also deliver on all fronts.
348;Oliver Reed is hilariously entertaining as Proximo and Richard Harris is effective as the dying Marcus Aurelius, but it's Djimon Hounsou who really shines here.
349;With his moving portrayal of Juba, a fellow gladiator, he brings to us a glimmer of hope amidst the doomed affair.
350;as wonderfully effective as the cast truly is there is no star like the amazing cinematography.
351;With each and every passing of the camera lens the screen illuminates with detail unlike any other.
352;The Italian country side is gorgeously captured, the Roman Coliseum (as digitally remastered as it is) is fantastically accurate and the set designs are breathtaking to say the least.
353;What I found amazing was that each and every actor looked dignified and authentic, which is hard to do when you're running around in togas and fighting in sandals.
354;i'm sure there are plenty of individuals who will find fault with this film but this is one of the only times where I wholeheartedly agree with the Academy in their choice of best film of the year.
355;`Gladiator' is, in my humble opinion, the best film to be released in 2000, and in some areas the best film to be released in the past decade.
356;Whether or not you worship this film as much as I do I'm sure you at least have to agree that it is, above all else, stunning.
357;After winning an Oscar(c) for Best Picture, this movie is just perfect for that title.
358;Even though Gladiator is not for the 'squelish' (battle scenes show much violence), this movie is certainly the best movie I have ever seen and anybody who watches will agree 100%.
359;The decent action scenes are the reason this thing got 2 stars.
360;ray version, you'll see that in image 3 (with the Germania caption) part of the spear on the left.
361;processing software thought that it should blend in with the tress in the background.
362;Nice use for the device :) So much for reading.
363;I like this movie, for an epic battle flick it is pretty good although it is a bit long and the battle scenes.
364;GLADIATOR is an enjoyable film with great acting (of course) by Crowe, who carries the film with his singularly massive screen presence.
365;The locations are great and the script is good if forgettable.
366;This probably should NOT have won best picture, but you already knew that.
367;Even so, it remains one of the better films of the year.
368;The second disc is packed with material which you can read about if you so choose.
369;Well for me the movie was great from start to finish.
370;The special effects and the actors and actress were wonderful.
371;I myself found myself crying in two parts of the movie,it takes a really good movie to get me to cry.
372;The depiction of the gladiators and Rome back then is pretty good as well.
373;Love the acting, and the movie was well made.
374;The product was very good.
375;I know that Hollywood Execs think that we viewers have short attention spans but this masterpiece of a movie would be even greater with the deleted scenes put back into the movie.
376;Gladiator is a fantastic movie.
377;Russell Crowe is a great actor who delivers an excellent performance as Maximus.
378;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
379;When I look at a movie based on true, historical events, I look at it from two angles.
380;from an entertainment point of view, this movie was fantastic.
381;It kept we on the edge of my seat, and it offered a wonderful glimpse into the mind set of the Romans during the peak of their empire.
382;The fight scenes were the best of have seen in any movie, and the plot was wonderful.
383;After that, the movie pretty much disrgarded the actual events, and continued on into a very enjoyable, but largely inaccurate story during the reign of Commodus.
384;enjoy this movie for what it is, a great story LOOSELY based on history.
385;For a complex film, Gladiator can still be taken for a simple heroic story.
386;not only is Maximus a proficient General but he is also skilled at personal combat.
387;And so, we have a classic revenge scenario.
388;This sort of plot can become laughably predictable but thanks to a decent script and Crowe's outstanding performance, we are forced into the cauldron of hate along with Maximus.
389;It is the fact that the Emperor himself presents the award in person, a clear avenue to consummation of his vengeful goals.
390;As his fame spreads, he draws the powerful to him
391;a lot of people have praised the special effects and cinematography of Gladiator.
392;Everything seemed too newly minted
393;It rests squarely on Crowe's shoulders and he successfully carries it beyond the realms of mediocrity, raising it up to become a modern classic.
394;A great ensambel cast rounds out this incredible battle of heart and spirit vs. evil and jealousy!
395;ray and cheer on Crowe in all of his battles to the end.
396;But when a movie is filmed in your homeland and is all over the press then one must see it.
397;The advancement in technology and special effects are in Gladiator's advantage but so is the casting.
398;The story of a General's fall and rise to Arena champion in his pursuit of vengeance is powered by Russel Crowe's great performance and Ridley Scott's impressive direction.
399;This 2 Disc set does the film justice.
400;Another impressive effort from Dreamworks.
401;the video transfer presented in anamorphic widescreen is extremely impressive.
402;The opening battle is also complemented by the earthy tones present in the transfer giving the film a gritty and realistic look.
403;The Dolby Digital track is very impressive.
404;The clarity is there and it makes an impressive use of the surrounds.
405;eS 6.1 Discrete soundtrack is amazing.
406;The sound is absolutely amazing.
407;The 3 documentaries are very interesting.
408;As well as plenty of storyboards and trailers and TV Spots.
409;The Spencer Treat Clark journal is actually quite interesting so give it a read.
410;Lastly the commentary with Ridley Scott and the Cinematographer and Pietro Scalia is very interesting and entertaining.
411;Gladiator is a good movie.
412;A good movie, not a great movie.
413;Russel Crowe, as usual, was very good.
414;So, I give it the good rating for action production values and a good cast giving okay performances.
415;The acyion sceans were toataly cool and the story was general but when they were wraped up into one seqence it made a really good moovie.
416;GLADIATOR is one of the best movies of the year 2000 If you are going to see only one movie, it better be GLADIATOR.
417;This movie is amazing, don't miss it
418;The story broke my heart, but it was full of action and looked deep into the characters minds and personalities.
419;determined storyline, it was still an amazing movie.
420;Among the best movies of all time.
421;fi director only associated with Alien he has outdone himself with this astounding piece of cinematic art.
422;ridley Scott put the viewer in the middle of the battlefield with this technique!
423;actor Russell Crowe has definitley cemented his bonafide great actor status with this role.
424;connie Nielsen as Lucilla also proved herself very worthy !
425;actor or Sir Richard Harris gives a very fine and strong performance that does bring some classy ambiance to Gladiator when the heartwrenching story is anything but
426;the Hans Zimmer soundtrack is one of the most haunting and evocative scores that will stay in the viewer's mind for quite some time.
427;it is both compelling and ethereal in nature that exquisitely expresses every nuance, emotion, and motion of the film and characters precisely.
428;The day by day diary of filming by one of the actors is an enjoyable read (if your eyes don't strain from reading your t. v. screen).
429;This movie is one of my absolute favorites.
430;Happy to have it in my collection.
431;It goes by so fast and leaves u wanting to see it again.
432;It has everything adventure, action, romance, elements of horror, fiction, non.
433;fiction and a few comedic moments.
434;This movie is compared to Braveheart, The Patriot Conan the Barbarian and other movies and it stands up to n e on of those.
435;Conan is an extremely gory movie (very good movie but gory) and Gladiator would be a joy to watch after, to get away from all it's blood shed.
436;I prefer my flicks to be a bit more subdued.
437;on the good side, the cinemaphotography is breathtaking.
438;Really lovely shots that I kept imagining framed and on my wall.
439;Acting is well done and Gravitas (Oliver Reed) was splendid.
440;scenes, and cutting room floor extras that make it an outstanding value.
441;It was really well done.
442;This is one of the better movies you'll see all year.
443;joaquin and Russell work amazingly well.
444;It is hard to distinguish a better performance between them.
445;They are two actors at the top of their game.
446;It is amazing to me the transition Russell Crowe made from his last role (in the Insider) to the role of Maximus in this film.
447;Richard Harris is brilliant as Marcus Aurelius, and Djimon Hounsou is incredible as Juba, one of Maximus' allies in the gladiator ring.
448;the special effects are unnoticable, which is the highest compliment a special effect can receive.
449;The pairing of Commodus and Maximus in the final bout was unexpected, yet perfect.
450;the bottom line here is that this is a superb picture .
451;it riles and stirs your emotion, and demands your attention.
452;It is truly a triumph.
453;This movie was beautifully mastered and a great adittion to my collection.
454;This is my favorite movie by far and would recommend the extended version for sure.
455;Gladiator is a Hollywood epic at its best: an action.
456;packed adventure story with good guys versus bad guys, and some kind of uplifting moral message.
457;i don't deny that Gladiator is a great movie.
458;In order to make Maximus a morally upright person, Gladiator has to portray him almost as a Christian!
459;He prays to his gods or ancestors in Christian fashion, acts a bit like Jesus turning the other cheek before smiting his enemies, and ends up in Heaven.
460;despite these inaccuracies (which I as an annoying smart alec just have to point out), I nevertheless recommend this movie.
461;Definitely recommend this awesome movie on high definition.
462;What fascinates me about this film was the heavy use of computer graphics in the making of the film, including the stunning remaking of the Colosseum.
463;unlike Titanic however, this film is actually blessed with good performance, a decent script, and a fair amount of historical research.
464;Everytime I see one of these mega.
465;by the way, If you want to see a great battle scene with a wonderful score check out Ran by Kurowsawa.
466;He turns the battle sounds off and turns up the score, for a truely amazing experience.
467;I'd rather read the book and use my imagination.
468;i give it one star for the effort it took to stage the opening battle scene.
469;There is an excellent story line here.
470;the movie is about Russell Crowe's main character Maximus who gets majorly shafted after many years of good service to the Roman empire.
471;He does a wonderful job.
472;richard Harris was an excellent pick to play the role of Marcus Aurelius and plays the wise leader with great finesse.
473;the set design and special effects were wonderfully done.
474;i can see why this film was so well applauded when it first came out.
475;The acting was superb, by the leading actor and actress and also the supporting actors.
476;This type of movie has not been done in a great while, so it was great to see it's kind, once again, brought to life on the movie screen.
477;The conversing between characters truly draws you into the movie's tale.
478;And the ending, while it was not extravagant, was well done and complimented this movie perfectly.
479;To reitterate, Truly an Oscar winner.
480;While hearing both of the tracks (DD and DTS), they were both stunning to say the least.
481;This film made the Roman Army real.
482;One of the Best Movies ever made.
483;ridley Scott and Russel Crowe + amazing cast did so well that, i will show this movie to my kids as part of their education.
484;From beginning to end i was taken in with the stunning fighting sequences and wonderful story line.
485;Oh and i can't forget to mention the monumental size of extras and special features that occupy disc 2.
486;Gladiator is certainly the greatest movie ever made.
487;But, Gladiator is a much better movie all around.
488;It has a very strong story line and very talented actors.
489;If you see only one movie in your lifetime, see GLADIATOR!
490;this is an awesome great movie.
491;it really help me in that time.
492;There's a picture of Marcus Aurelius.
493;I do have to admit, the fight sequences were very well done, and the technique Ridley Scott used to give the film that look of quickness ( I don't know how to descibe it) works extremely well.
494;The acting is excellent and the storyline is great.
495;I went to the theatres and watched it and after it was over I was amazed because I have never in my life see a movie like this and withouta doubt this is the greatest movie of 2000 and one of my favorites of all time.
496;anyways watch this classic for yourself and it will just turn your prospective of movies upside down, Russel Crowe glows in this classic.
497;I give it a 5 star for action and raw emotion.
498;I love Russell Crowe in just about any action flick.
499;I watch very very few movies these days.
500;But, I really enjoyed the story (even though it was fiction with historical characters thrown in) the setting, the costumes, the acting.
501;I really liked the warfare in the beginning and seeing what technology they had available at the time.
502;i thought this was a good action adventure movie with a fascinating historical setting as a backdrop.
503;I love movies but this one in particular surprised me with the ending that I would typically dislike but somehow they pulled it off REALLY well.
504;This is in my top 10 of all time.
505;The film was created to make money, not to stimulate our intellect and I understand that and in the end I said to myself, i could see this again, only for the ability of Crowe to convey to us the power of loss and imprisonment and especially for the stunning battles sequences that are exciting.
506;Gladiator definitely deserved to win the Oscar.
507;The drama and action compliment eachother quite well in this film, which is often hard to find in recent movies.
508;The fight scenes are amazing, but are made even more amazing because of the drama and emotions that flow beneath the action.
509;Russel Crowe is amazing in this film and definitely grabs the audience and brings them into this ancient civilization.
510;The movie represents the time they were shooting for and has really great effects.
511;The battle scenes themselves are worth purchasing, especially with all of the extra footage and bonus disc!
512;ray of Braveheart, which looks extremely good!!
513;It's beautiful to see a package that puts it all together.
514;For one thing, the movie utilizes scenes from the collective consciousness to great effect and give the movie a sense of dignified closure that I've never seen elsewhere.
515;Honest, my favorite scene in the movie is the brief opening shot of Maximus with his hand running through the wheat.
516;The use of such visual tokens keep the emotional tension in the movie going until its perfect release at the end.
517;also very notable were the performances of Crowe Phoenix.
518;he was perfect in this role.
519;Gladiator is a great film, a must for anyone's library if they call themselves a student of film, history and/or entertainment in general.
520;the film is a beautiful representation of the Rome of our dreams and a brief period, the age of Commodus, within that grand vista.
521;I thought this movie was amazing!
522;Russell Crowe's performance was breathtaking and I was completely engrossed in the movie the entire time.
523;Also, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is great!
524;But definitely worth a watch, if not several!
525;The last five minutes of this movie is my favorite.
526;Superb acting, great dialogue, and that song.
527;This movie is one of the classic great movies of all time.
528;Ridley Scott is a great director and he is teamed up with Russell Crow, who gave his greatest performance to date.
529;A stirring, moving film with a simply fantastic score.
530;It's Oliver Reed's last performance and one of his greatest but it pales behind Russell Crowe.
531;Prepare to be deeply moved, and also to fall in love.
532;It's my favorite, and I never tire of viewing it over and over.
533;You gotta see this movie!
534;But its still a great disc, and a must have!
535;This is too good of a movie with such great effects to watch on one.
536;What's up with this widescreen format.
537;this comes from an action fan, and this aint no action film i was expecting something to keep me excited and on the edge of my seat.
538;Well written (apart from some of the historical error's, but it is hollywood), well acted and brilliant effects.
539;The story really gets you involved and makes you associate with the characters.
540;Dispite a few minor error's in the history the rest is very accute (eg the brutalness and the slave trade) and makes you want to know more about Roman History and makes history enjoyable.
541;You will enjoy every moment of this and go through every emotion.
542;First off, the extras are spectacular.
543;With these, you can actually see how this movie was made, and it'll take you at least 3 days to review all the stuff on this disc.
544;This is also a very good movie, not great, but good.
545;The movie was remastered really well keeping the original essence intact.
546;Its a delight to watch and brings back the wonderful memories of old times
547;It's a good thing though to familiarize modern audiences with the likes of Marcus Aurelius, however, and the movie deserves the accolades that it got.
548;Russell Crowe is magnificent here as was Joaquin Phoenix.
549;The latter's career is rising at present in the same manner as the mythic creature with the production of outstanding work in both The Village and Walk the Line.
550;They're both excellent actors and are perfectly cast in this epic.
551;Gladiator has about all you need from a film with constant action, beautiful sets, and an intriguing plot.
552;It's a quick couple of hours and you'll find yourself surprised at how soon it is over.
553;this gladiator movie is for today's audience and may someday become a classic.
554;Instead of having a splashy image like John Wayne, Russell Crowe has to blend in with the movie and the story.
555;He must be ruthless and compassionate almost at the same time.
556;See Joaquin again as Johnny Cash in Walk the Line.
557;This is a great movie.
558;Russel Crowe is fantastic in it.
559;This is definitely one of my favorite movies, even though if you don't like blood and gore it probably is not for you.
560;There are some intense scenes that could distrube some people.
561;But the story line is great and the characters are well develop.
562;this is one of my top 5 favorite movies.
563;But it also has a rich moral and ethical thread that I think most films lack.
564;russell Crowe is the heroic general Maximus, who doesn't succumb to the tempatation to kill just to kill, but sees the bigger picture.
565;The secenry of Morocco in NW Africa is gorgeous as anyone who has seen it can attest to.
566;there are no perfect movies.
567;Others have shared what they remember and liked about the film, and I agree with most of them.
568;I always wanted the nice, clear picture of Blu Ray and now I finally have it.
569;It is a great tale,perhaps historical, i`ll have to go o computer to decipher it!!!!
570;Maximus the great!More words is tooo much folderal!
571;I don't watch many movies, spend most of my time writing and reading, but this movie captivated and held my attention.
572;Few movies carry you through the gamut of emotions from anger, disgust, hate as well as happiness and satisfaction as Gladiator.
573;The story line will stay with me forever.
574;I recommend this to anyone looking for a powerful movie, one that you will want to see more than once.
575;This movie has everything, great story, wonderful actors.
576;This is a truly awesome movie.
577;From the dynamic beginning the surprising ending, this is a terrific movie all the way through.
578;Once in Rome, well, you'll just have to watch for yourself.
579;This is one of the best movies I have seen and definitley the best of 2000.
580;ray that contains this movie with 2 others running for about $25.00!
581;Its watchable if you like a one man army show like the rambo style movies.
582;I love Russell Crowe and I love gladiator movies!
583;I have seen this movie around 50 times and still love it.
584;I highly recomend this movie
585;this is one of those movies that when it ends you sit there and think about it and how amazingly good it was.
586;inducing, while some of the Colosseum fights, one involving tigers, are quite something (albeit very similar to WWF matches).
587;She does well in an otherwise dull ensemble.
588;there is no way Gladiator could have been a great film on the level of Spartacus or Ben Hur.
589;I'm a bit taken aback by the fact that this film recieved so many oscar nods, but it indeed is a film that is immensely enjoyable, and both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix give outstanding performances.
590;There are good movies and there are great movies.
591;A great movie has the ability to transport the audience from mere spectator to participant.
592;He is a storied hero, a man with integrity and values, honorable to his lord, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
593;Although the film is not completely accurate in its historicity, Scott gives enough fact to send the audience back in time to ancient Rome, during the reign of the Caesars.
594;the film begins on the battlefield with Rome engaging in one last conflict.
595;A victory will further expand the Empire and secure its quest for world domination, a worthy achievement for a Roman emperor.
596;Let us hope for the last time.
597;Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, would soon take over the reign of the great empire and almost instantaneously, the dream that was Rome would disappear.
598;gLADIATOR is a great movie, and one of epic proportions.
599;It is so good that it can be watched repeatedly, with the audience standing in awe, learning something new with each showing.
600;This is a film with plenty of action thus satisfying those with a lust for bloody fight scenes.
601;Men especially will enjoy watching Maximus in his gladiator battles, but women will be enamored with his softer side.
602;He is a loyal family man, honorable, and a man of integrity.
603;Scott paints a vivid picture for audiences as he is acute to historical detail, such as the scenes from the Roman Colisseum, which give the audience a real sense of being there.
604;Moreover, Scott touches on some philosophical and sociological issues that will appease the intellectual mind as well.
605;gLADIATOR is a great movie, because it has a fine cast of actors, beginning with Russell Crowe (Maximus) in the lead role.
606;Crowe is perfect for the part, having lost around 40 lbs.
607;His performance was outstanding and the success of the film depended on it.
608;Moreover, the supporting cast was wonderful from top to bottom, but add two seasoned veterans like Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed (Proximo) to this list and you get a great movie.
609;His role as Proximo, the trainer of gladiators, was excellent as his character was both tough and funny.
610;GLADIATOR belongs in every family's movie archive, yes, it is that GREAT.
611;Gladiator is one of the greatest films of the last several decades, a cinematic masterpiece transcending time and genre.
612;Part drama, part historical, part action, it is all excellent.
613;A superbly crafted tale full of spectacles, twists, and intense drama, it is set in one of the Roman Empire's most interesting times
614;Very few films have pulled me in so completely
615;much has been said of the battle scenes, and they are indeed among the most brilliant ever filmed.
616;notch, the actions are performed skillfully, and everything .
617;Above all, it is unusually realistic, so visceral we almost feel it.
618;This is far from the usual light Hollywood fare
619;That said, it is important to remember that the film is set in a particularly bloody part of the always bloody Roman Empire
620;The story of Maximus, one of modern film's more believable, immediate, and deeply stirring heroes, is incredibly rousing.
621;perhaps even in part because of it, which says much about the film's remarkable subtlety.
622;His struggles and triumphs move us greatly
623;Perhaps Gladiator's most notable aspect is diversity
624;packed as it is, it also has more than a little romance and even some humor.
625;rounded films in recent memory, strongly pulling us in many directions.
626;also highly noteworthy is the vivid Roman Empire recreation.
627;Director Ridley Scott of course had the benefits of CGI .
628;but wisely avoids overusing it.
629;Nearly any other director would have relied on it to realism's detriment, but he skillfully mixes it with sets and straight footage, creating a stunning montage.
630;Few films are so visually breathtaking
631;The coliseums are also well.
632;It takes a rare film to bring a distant era so vibrantly to life, but this succeeds beyond all expectations.
633;Verisimilitude is what makes it work, but it is important to keep in mind that, despite being a historical film, it is not strictly historical.
634;The important thing is that everything seems plausible and is well.
635;level history will be disappointed, but Gladiator does the important service of making an important time seem interesting and relevant
636;pressed to find another film with such consistently fine performances.
637;dimensional film heroes one can think of, and he pulls off all the angles with mesmerizing force.
638;Crowe has a presence that few actors have and most would give nearly anything for
639;This comes to the fore, as he moves from a tough guy persona worthy of any pure action hero to thoughtfulness to tenderness and seemingly everywhere else.
640;His Commodus is one of the most fearsomely convincing villains in screen history
641;notably Proximo, played by Oliver Reed in his last role .
642;all told, Gladiator deserves to stand with the all.
643;time great films
644;I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman.
645;on the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non.
646;incestuous sister was very attractive.
647;Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.
648;Beautiful visuals, exciting action, great cinematography, standout score!
649;Naturally a very predictable storyline, but the fact that you've seen so many movies from this genre and it still moves you speaks volumes!!
650;A magnificent and wholly believable performance by Russel Crowe.
651;provoking masterwork with intense,harrowing,awesome battle scenes both on the field and the coliseum
652;worthy performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix
653;It's good and Ridley Scott does a great job at directing this big film because that is what it is!
654;Anyways Maximus is a true warrior in the film and I love the old fashion tactics they used when fighting against the herd of monsters from within the colesium.
655;The visuals were very good, but that's about it.
656;And everybody thought it was a good movie.
657;Because you can have the best idea in the world for a movie, but it's all in the execution.
658;Russell Crowe is one of the best things about the movie Gladiator, because with all of its spectacle and grand battle sequences, it lacks in the dramatic sense and its special effects are so video game.
659;Some of the sequences involving the colosseum are so see.
660;A film like Gladiator is graded on the superb nature of its art direction, cinematography, battle sequences, the courageousness of its hero, and the length of the venomous fangs of its villain.
661;On those levels, it succeeds as well as any Roman epic ever made.
662;Russell Crowe does make the perfect hero, and Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Commodus.
663;The dramatic highpoints, which we always know are coming, but the payoff is worth the wait, are very well written.
664;vision, they are extremely intense.
665;The art direction is fabulous.
666;And of course, a film like this, on such a grand scale, needs a director who has directed many influential films over the years.
667;Gladiator has Ridley Scott, who has directed such films as the 1979 sci.
668;He has also directed Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise.
669;( He'll give them death, and they'll love him for it. )
670;This much goes without saying, but Gladiator does have its fair share of surprises, and those pleasant events make the movie worth watching.
671;Gladiator doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar, that honor, I believe, belongs to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it is truly heroic filmmaking of the highest calibur.
672;I just would've liked to see something with better visuals and a better handled sense of drama.
673;Add in the fact that this is a fantastic movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it should be clear why this movie deserves a spot on your shelf!
674;Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea!
675;Americans, to remind ourselves of honor and sacrifice for our country's original values.
676;`Gladiator', directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe succeeds, like `Spartacus' and unlike `Troy' because it is less about action and violence than it is about politics and righting a wrong.
677;In fact, it is a great treat to see talented special effects put to good use on something other than star destroyers, Nazgul, and vampires.
678;They added lots of very effective touches such as the relatively recently discovered awnings used to shade the fans in the upper bleachers.
679;Combat, both in pitched battle in Germania and in the arena is very well researched.
680;It was an excellent little touch to see Maximus loose a sword, only to instantly draw a backup sword from his saddle and continue reigning death and distruction on the barbarians.
681;It's amazing how a minor inaccuracy can ruin the effect of some of the very best movies, such as when modern tanks were used in battles between Americans and Germans in North Africa in `Patton'.
682;note that most of the special effects really succeed better on the small screen than they do on a big theatrical screen.
683;hour interview, he revealed a greater insight into the craft of acting than the interviews of William H. Macy, Robert Redford, and Robin Williams all rolled into one.
684;the three veteran character actors, Oliver Reed as the gladiator master, Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and Derek Jacobi as the Roman senator, Graccus, competently carry out their roles, but none are quite as convincing as the second string actors in the great Masterpiece Theatre series `I, Claudius'.
685;historical characters need both powerful performances and recognizable faces so you instantly know this is an important character, since they will probably be on the screen for less than a quarter of the movie.
686;all of this is interesting to gab about, but the real meat of the movie, again, is politics.
687;Crowe's description of the genesis of the character in his interview convinces me that he is pure invention, which the writers were to name `Narcissus'.
688;i must say that the music written for the movie, especially for the dream sequences when Maximus anticipates returning to his family in Elysium (heaven of Roman religion), is especially effective, even if the tunes and the vocals have a very strong Gaelic sound to them.
689;The dream melodies would fit quite nicely into the elven scenes of `Lord of the Rings' as they do in ancient Rome.
690;`Gladiator' may not endure as a classic like `Spartacus', but Crowe's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
691;The movie works at every level.
692;It is a compelling story told by a strong cast, backed by breathtaking cinematography and a haunting musical score.
693;It is an unparalled blend of action, morality and romance.
694;The movie presents without preaching what every man should want to be, heroic without conceit, loyal to self and family without compromise, cognisant of duty without ambition.
695;It is a movie that will cause you to pause and think weeks after you see it.
696;The direction was excellent, and several of the scenes were (for a lack of a better term) really COOL.
697;What most people don't realise is that you have to suspend belief somethimes to truely enjoy a movie.
698;overall good story that may lag a little at times.
699;joaquin Phoenix should have won Best Supporting Actor for this role.
700;One of the best movie Heels ever.
701;a true Classic movie from modern times.
702;I love history so that's probably why I loved this movie so much buteven if yournot a history freak like me you will still like this movie.
703;Loved the movie in the theatre.
704;The movie pauses and jerks around in the middle of the movie.
705;The movie is awesome and is definitely a 5 star movie.
706;I came here to check and see if others were having the same problems and it appears so.
707;It was definitely worth my money.
708;it has everything an epic needs.
709;The movie is about honor and survival(and some other stuff that I couldn't remember since I watched it several months ago).
710;The movie was realistic in that it got some of the less savory sides of humanity in it.
711;One of which is the fact that the prince is in love with his sister.
712;I would give it 4.5 stars.
713;Hope you find it just as good as I do.
714;I decided to just pick one and thankfully made the right choice the first time.
715;Gladiator revisits the epic genre last seen in Ben Hur and in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus.
716;Scott's Gladiator successfully explores the formidable savagery of the Roman gladiator games and the ageless and universal appeal for violence.
717;having proven his valiant commitment to Rome, the great General Maximus (Russell Crowe) earns the respect of his army and of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
718;gladiator is the product of the carefully choreographed sword fights, of magnificent set design, especially the reconstruction of the Coliseum, accurate costume designs, and weaponry design.
719;The character's strength and appeal derives from a well.
720;developed role and from Crowe's accurate personification and skillful performance.
721;gladiator, however, owes most of its success to its clever exploration of the notion of spectatorship.
722;Consequently, Gladiator manages to lure the viewer into reacting as the Roman crowd does, ultimately rejecting the villains and sympathizing with the inspiring hero, as the Roman crowd does.
723;All in all, Gladiator is a spectacular film that cleverly uses its poignant images and its powerful characters to create a dramatic story that speaks of the corruptibility of the human mind and the redeeming powers of love and justice.
724;This is the best movie I've ever seen.
725;There is never a dull moment thanks to the outstanding direction of Ridley Scott.
726;The cinematography is equally amazing as is the performance of Russell Crowe.
727;The story is rivetting, thrilling, captivating .
728;It has all the ingredients of the perfect guy movie: a villian that you develop a seething hatred for, and a hero with such courage, strength and conviction that you can't help but feel his every pain, share his every emotion, and admir.
729;I was so impressed by the movie I had to go back in the theatre and watch the very next showing.
730;This is my favorite movie of all time.
731;Definitely a classic to own and watch once a year (or more).
732;once in a rare while, Hollywood outdoes themselves and creates a timeless classic that can be watched over and over.
733;right up there with the stand out movies of the century.
734;everyone should own this just to see the Coliseum scenes.
735;This is probably Ridley Scott's best since the original Alien, though some would probably argue that this is an even better film.
736;hur, but this is far better, especially the final scene in the Coliseum, an appropriate climax to such a grand film.
737;Great and historical movie, plus it's got Russell Crowe in it so that's your selling point right there is it not?
738;This movie never gets old to me, everything about it is just perfect.
739;The sound effects are great and really immerse you into the movie.
740;GLADIATOR is the best movie I have ever seen.
741;It is grand in scale, with an excellent cast and plot.
742;He then must become a gladiator to win his freedom.
743;His quest for freedom will make for a great film.
744;this film has grand special effects that transport us back to Ancient Rome.
745;We are able to see the splendour, the atrocity, and moral decay that was Rome.
746;We look past this, as we see a great man's struggle for freedom and justice.
747;This struggle is the main point of this masterpiece.
748;If you like violence, fighting, or period pieces you will love GLADIATOR.
749;this is a drama of life and death that is worth your time.
750;My favorite movie of all time.
751;Russell Crowe is epic in his performance.
752;Some of the more ambitious shots look about as realistic as a CG cinema from a video game.
753;I don't see how a lot of citics think it's one of the best movies ever made.
754;The only Acadamy Awards I would give this film are Best Actor for Russel Crowe, Best Director(the screenplay is not Ridley Scott's fault), art direction, and costume design.
755;Gladiator will definitely be nominated for Best Picture but I hope it doesn't win.
756;If you are a real man,this movie is all about honor and the betrayell of that honor.
757;and ladies,this is how you want a man to love You!
758;An awesome movie about ancient Rome, and quite possibly the greatest empire of all time.
759;Please, do yourself a favor, and EXPERIENCE this movie!
760;Gladiator is an epic that never dissapoints.
761;With the score by good ole Hans, and Ridley Scott directs.
762;release this film in all of it's splendor.
763;As Maximus rose above in this film, we too should rise above this atrocity and demand a re.
764;This Extended Edition is getting 2 stars for the following reasons
765;Contrast was properly set up and the movie is sharp.
766;That's right, the DTS version.
767;Gladiator has one of the best DTS tracks ever on it, everything is so clear and perfectly balanced.
768;Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and nominated for an additional seven, Gladiator is one of the best produced and directed films of its time.
769;Reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Braveheart, it creates a world so seemingly realistic, that you find yourself drawn backward in time to the glory days of Rome.
770;The musical score, the costumes, and the sets form a synergy that, with lifelike animation, serves to replicate life in early millennial Rome.
771;the opening scene of Gladiator is simply awe.
772;inspiring as the Roman legions advance on a band of rebels resisting the empire from the outskirts of Gaul.
773;The scene invokes more memories of Desert Storm than an ancient battlefield, and it visually illustrates the overwhelming power that was once the Roman Empire.
774;the leader of this battle is Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Roman general loved by his men and admired throughout the empire for his impeccable character.
775;a magnificent fighter in his own right, and enjoying the aid of friends in the legion, Maximus manages to escape his death sentence.
776;at this point, the true action of the movie takes hold, as Maximus (ideal soldier of the Roman Empire) runs roughshod over his opponents in the gladiatorial arena.
777;Meanwhile, Lucilla (sister of Commodus and former lover of Maximus) works as a power broker behind the scenes, attempting to bring the Senate and the army together in order to remove Commodus and restore the power of the Republic.
778;The action sequences provide endless thrills, and the dialogue between the characters is wrought with political intrigue, lust for power, and conflicting realities.
779;Russell Crowe is superb in his role as the hero Maximus.
780;Noble in his intentions and powerful as a leader, Maximus represents the ideal of honor and chivalry.
781;One of those rare films that forces the audience to root for its characters, Gladiator is a definite must.
782;If you liked the movies Braveheart or The Patriot, then you'll love Gladiator.
783;This movie has it all (strong characters, action, revenge, and cool computer animation)!
784;Fun, good story, great acting, it earned the Oscar it won.
785;It is an expertly mounted and eye.
786;thirsty movie goer
787;I was reminded of Camelot many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis.
788;Joaquin Phoenix gives a bone.
789;Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed.
790;His work in Gladiator is a tour de force performance
791;It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeds expectations in that regard.
792;I thought Crowe would be great, like he's a great actor!
793;The only one I liked was the slave that helped out Maximus(Crowe), he was pretty good!
794;Looked stunning, sounded stunning .
795;and my son came away from his first viewing ever of this masterpiece with a simple, one.
796;What can I say, this is one of my favorite movies.
797;Great story, great soundtrack, gladiators fighting in the arena, and now it is on Blu.
798;I agree with everyone's review on this movie, it's enthawing!
799;This is the movie everyone should view as I've seen it more then several times, and right now HBO is showing it again and I do not tire of Russell Crowe's excellent performance as he and he alone makes the character General Maximus believable at epic proportions and it's no wonder he won an award for his performance here.
800;Besides, everyone should know that above average intelligent people are always a bit more.
801;This is the first Crowe movie I have ever seen and I am impressed.
802;i also think Jocaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor.
803;He plays a character that you just love to hate and he is really good at it too.
804;Between the two of them, I can see why they took over the world by a storm.
805;This is a movie between good and evil, for the greater cause and for love.
806;gladiator is a movie for both women and men ~~ it really shows humanity in its best and vilest forms.
807;And the photography is just stunning.
808;This is a movie that I highly recommend.
809;The movie starts off intense with a great battle and barely stops all the way to the end.
810;Ridley Scott's Gladiator is by far one of my favorite movies.
811;Russell Crowe's performance is a masterpiece.
812;The hero is easy to relate to and the villain you will love to hate.
813;The picture and sounds make you feel right in the action and back in time.
814;Hats off to the amazing work that the crew and visual effects people have done for this film.
815;winner of Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costumes, Best Visual Effects, and Best Picture.
816;Fighting for family, love, honor.
817;Trust in your friends, duty, and to top it all off with courage and the will to never give up.
818;I rate this 5/5 stars and recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
819;Tons of special features as well.
820;A great movie on Roman History and how one man, whom was dedicated to Rome, after losing everything that was good in his life, carries on to win the hearts of the many in defiance of one.
821;a fantastic movie that you will watch more then once.
822;This is one of the best movies of all time.
823;All actors play their characters perfectly.
824;Special effects are awesome, story is riveting, costumes first rate.
825;This is a MUST see.
826;I can't say that it's as clean as say, A Bug's Life or Toy Story (which are pretty much transferred straight from the hard drive to the disc with nothing in between), but I can say that the picture is great.
827;As a matter of fact it's among the best.
828;The opening battle scene alone is great for showing off that killer sound that you have in your high end system.
829;Even if you don't have a receiver that decodes 6.1, you can still get a great 5.1 DTS sound using the 6.1 sound option that the disc offers (you'll just be missing the one extra rear speaker) and it still sounds great.
830;While on the subject of sound, I must also mention that this movie has one the best muscial scores/soundtracks of any movie.
831;The music just adds an entire other dimension to the movie, and suits the movie so well.
832;finally, there are the extra features.
833;Deleted scenes, documentaries, behind the scenes, etc.
834;I thought it was interesting to see how Russell Crowe really was outside his Gladiator character.
835;It has everything you can ask for!
836;This film is absolutly, undoubtably the best film i have ever seen!
837;It has something for everyone.
838;Combining Action with adventure, Mystery with Romance, you'll be on the edge of your seats i asure you!
839;I think that Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as Maximus, the roman general turned slave gladiator!
840;The score to this film is also a must have, there are two versions of the soundtrack, i have both and they are both excellent.
841;Truly and epic, and it deserves all the Oscar awards it received.
842;This is by far one of my favorite movies, and one of Russel Crowe's best.
843;It gets me amped everytime I watch it and its very inspiring.
844;probably this movie will for a long time be compared with Braveheart,since both are epic movies about historical heroes,but I don't think it is fair to say that the Gladiator imitates Braveheart.
845;it's the story of a Roman general,Maximus,who is very much appreciated and loved by both his soldiers and the emperor.
846;he adds so much to the character he is playing,an ideal human figure,a Roman soldier who is all about honor.
847;the music is also great,I highly recommend the soundtrack.
848;This is one of the most exciting films.
849;It was gripping all the way through.
850;Ridley Scott is a favourite director of mine and I waited anxiously for this.
851;The epic may have passed from popularity decades ago, but every so often the genre crops its head up and shows us just why these types of movies are so compelling.
852;Gladiator is a solidly acted movie and well directed.
853;I'm not going to hide the fact that Ridley Scott is my favorite director, and this movie is a good example of his directorial talent.
854;are true to their historical personas.
855;In actuality, both were very strong individuals.
856;It's intention was to create a compelling story centering around a fictional general.
857;Both Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix (especially Phoenix) create multi.
858;again, a solidly acted movie with the spectacular Ridley Scott at the directorial helm.
859;Give up your reservations against its historical inaccuracies and embrace its artistic vision.
860;I won't go into the story summaries as so many reviewers have already covered that territory, but this film is definitely a winner for women, as well.
861;The story is engaging, the acting is amazing, and the cinemetography is divine.
862;I own the film and watch it often.
863;hur with all of the advance fanfare this film received.
864;There was fascinating material on this disk about the how to of the movie and about the history of Rome and gladiators, which we really enjoyed.
865;This seemingly endless film gets two stars only for the presence of the late great Oliver Reed (who has played much better roles), and decent costumes and fighting sequences.
866;Avoid at all costs, if entertainment is your aim.
867;And the action is great.
868;I know this film came out almost five years ago, but I just watched it again last weekend and I can't resist logging onto Amazon and telling you how inspiring this story is.
869;i'll skip talking about what a great actor Russel is (and he truly is) and jump right to the heart of the story.
870;The dialog is remarkably well written, and the acting is stunning.
871;down what was already a timeless masterpiece, the cinematography, the special effects and the music are humbling in their perfection.
872;Normally these are aspects of a movie I don't pickup on until the second or third time watching it, but in Gladiator ever element is so rich and beautiful that you can't help but be impressed with all of it from the very first time you watch it.
873;Despite how inspiring it is I don't think I would like my own son watch it until he is well, well into his teenage years.
874;But when he's ready, we will certainly enjoy it together.
875;Quick dickin around and push add to cart before your wife leaves you for the mail man!
876;My husband really likes Russell Crowe, and believe it or not, this was one he didn't have, so he got it as a gift and has watched many times now, enjoying the actor and the movie, was a good choice!
877;Although The Gladiator is not quite as long as either classic movie, it has taken the best elements from both.
878;Gladiator is one of my favorite movies.
879;It has action, drama, great cinematography, outstanding fight scenes, love, great acting, and most importantly, it's a great story.
880;Maximus becomes a slave, then a gladiator, eventually finding himself fighting in the Roman Coliseum in front of his nemesis, Commodus.
881;Crowe's performance is decent but certanly not an Oscar winning one.
882;The story itself was simply astonishing, it followed true Roman history and even incorporated various historical battles such as the remaking of the battle of carthage, which I thought to be a nice touch.
883;overall I was very, and still am very, impressed by this movie.
884;I will end this now so I can go watch a few chapters over again.
885;That sums up this thrilling movie.
886;the opening battle scene sets the stage for this intense film.
887;It grabs your interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film.
888;wronged soldier now fighting for justice.
889;Ancient Rome was nicely replicated in this film, as I truly felt like I was one of the townspeople during the movie.
890;The background setting and props used were fantastic, and they all added to the overall feel of the movie.
891;Not only did he look the part, but his acting was wonderful in this role.
892;loving character was portrayed perfectly, and frankly he made me hate him, so he did his job well.
893;Throw in an amazing musical score by Hans Zimmer, and you have one complete film.
894;The fighting scenes alone are worth the price of the video.
895;These exciting scenes are tremendous and you won't be able to stop yourself from cheering Maximus along.
896;this film is exciting, action.
897;packed, and yes, it is quite graphic.
898;I love this movie, it's my all time favorite.
899;ray is amazing, this was a great price, and it shipped really fast.
900;This is probably the most spectacular recreation on film, ever, of the ancient Roman Empire.
901;The camps of the Roman armies, the villas, the cities, all the detailed sets and costumes are awesomely real creations.
902;I've watched the movie twice and have liked it very well both times.
903;I've felt glad to be able to view such an outstanding SCENIC treasure.
904;I think that's the Number One most excellent thing about the movie.
905;the next very good thing about the movie is that it tells a very gripping story.
906;spiritual theme that figures into the story as well.
907;These seem to be tutelary spirits that the main character interweaves with his devoted love for his wife and son.
908;There are concepts of righteousness in these ancient people that the viewer, as a modern conscientious person, can identify with.
909;Ultimately the movie is worthwhile and satisfying not only because the viewer responds to the immense courage of the General, the Slave, the Gladiator, but also to his tender love for his wife and son, and the mysterious promise offered of the future love reunion in eternity.
910;After a long and successful campaign, all General Maximus wants is to get back Home, but his destiny is to keep fighting for the dream of his beloved Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who wants to give back power to the people of Rome by ending political corruption in the Senate.
911;The reinstatement of Republican integrity would rekindle the Glory of the Empire, the Great Light that had shone from pre.
912;And it's there that Maximus will seek to win his Freedom.
913;the most memorable thing for me about the movie was the way it depicted the near.
914;The casting choices of actors were excellent.
915;But the story will be interesting for males and females both.
916;This is one of my favorite movies all time.
917;Bought it as a gift for myself.
918;Maximus is a natural leader.
919;if he were able to persuade those in power in Rome of the worth of this ideal, Caesar's dreams of a powerful self.
920;Maximus is taken into the wood to be executed, his family to share the same fate.
921;managing to escape from his keepers, Maximus flees home.
922;Weak from battle and injury, he's captured by a caravan of slave traders.
923;Unwilling to fight in the training duels, Maximus proves himself unbeatable in actual combat.
924;In the meantime, Commodus knows the senate plans his removal and entertains the Roman people with the promise of great sport.
925;There will be 63 days of gladiator games in the great coliseum, to honor the memory of his father.
926;Maximus' greatest desire is to fight in those games, and stand before the emperor.
927;the beautiful Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), a former lover and older sister of Commodus.
928;She knows her brother's evil nature, suspects he had a hand in their father's death, and must constantly reject his overly friendly affections.
929;The magnificent buildings, the violence of the gladiator games, the cheering of the crowd.
930;The beautiful woman in distress, and the cruel villain, who in key scenes reveals a childlike helplessness.
931;Gladiator won Best Picture, among numerous other awards, and is well worth it.
932;The screenplay is rich with authentic, memorable dialogue.
933;The grand scale and costuming are impressive.
934;Though put into spattering blood a bit, the CGI is incredible.
935;The movie has a slightly sober but moving conclusion.
936;What it is, is an extremely moving film that shines with the elegant brilliance of a bygone era of filmmaking.
937;Our son wanted this movie in Blue Ray for a while.
938;Turned out to be a great surprise for him at Christmas.
939;Fantastic movie in any version.
940;The saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix.
941;There is even a scene in which a teacher paints a would.
942;I don't understand what the appeal is to this movie, except that those other movies have been long since forgotten and this can be viewed as a fresh epic.
943;Tom Hanks, who also was nominated that year for Cast Away, had to lose 70 punds, grow a 2 foot long beard and carry a movie by himself for 75 minutes, but Crowe's ablilty to kill people was one of the greatest acting jobs ever!
944;The movie formula is well known: hero taken from his place, his family mutilated, his land destroyed, he is flung into misery, he vows revenge, he endures several trials, he is the best warrior with incredible constitution, he fights back to the top, he wins the crowd, he is betrayed in his chance for an easy victory, he, nonetheless, overcomes the setback and kills the evil nemesis and saves the dignity of his people.
945;Most obviously, this is Braveheart, but it is as well numorous other recent films, including borrowing the bizarre spirituality of Messanger.
946;Third person works for Shakespeare, particularly when the production doesn't try to produce accents.
947;still, the visuals are Scottian.
948;And, that we expect from his great films and commercials.
949;I bought this for my wife for Valentines Day (it's actually her favorite movie), and we really enjoyed the extended footage.
950;Loved it when it came out and it only gets better every time I see it.
951;And Russell Crowe won the award for Best Actor instead of Ed Harris for Pollock!
952;Traffic is about the war on drugs.
953;I would tell you more about Traffic, but I want the film to intrigue you from beginning to end as it did me.
954;it is pretty obvious early on, after a nice big battle scene to open things up, that we have a tried.
955;true story of revenge underway.
956;i enjoy movies that have plenty of dialogue, and some of my favorite movies have not a whit of violence in them.
957;dimensional in what is, in essence, a live.
958;Love the movie, gotta watch it!!!
959;Amazon you have the best deals.
960;My respect for Oscar Awards received a jolt watching the movie.
961;This story of chivalry, velour, revenge, Roman politics, intrigue and not forgetting incest deserved a slower pace and more gradual development.
962;Gladiator was an excellent movie and has all the aspects required to be a true blockbuster.
963;Crowe is awesome as the General Maximus and provides an intensity and depth of character that truly makes the viewer emphasize with his trials throughout the film.
964;In short, great cast, great plot and great cinematography.
965;What a directorial tour de force for Ridley Scott.
966;This film is a beautiful mix of cinematic artistry, state of the art effects, powerful music by my favorite composer Hans Zimmer, fantastic acting from the entire cast and Ridley Scott weaving it all together masterfully.
967;the extras are true blessing especially when it comes to the deleted scenes.
968;Gladiator is a film that shines from the first frame to the last, with it's amazing performances, breathtaking cinematography and outstanding direction.
969;russell Crowe is brilliant in this film.
970;He wraps himself in this character and makes it his own, which gives the viewers a sense of compassion towards this being and understands the pain and anger that he has.
971;Joaquin Phoenix is great in being the villian of the film
972;director Ridley Scott, is fantastic in showing us the grand scale of The Roman Empire, with his glorious battle scenes and the magnificent scale of the Art Direction that is found with the Roman Statues and Architecture.
973;Scott establishes that he's a director with incredible vision and oustanding declaration for what he wants to present.
974;everything in this film is presented on a grand scale, which makes it's Oscar win for Best Picture the more deserving, since, it's a film that shows the true meaning of human emotion and a cinematic experience that can only be expressed in one word: Epic

977;looking, but overall they did a great job.
978;The bonus disc has some great extras that add a lot to the viewing experience.
979;I would recommend this movie to people who liked Braveheart, but don't expect Maximus to be William Wallace.
980;In any case, Gladiator has action, romance, and some great dramatic scenes that should be appealing to most movie enthusaists.
981;round movie), the Matrix and Brazil this is another great mood.
982;Besides being an excellent film it is jammed with extras.
983;The color and clarity of the film is phenomenal and the sound makes you believe that you are there.
984;If you liked Braveheart and the Patriot you'll love this movie.
985;Action packed and a story line you can follow.
986;Gladiator is an exceptional exception to the rule!
987;The battlescene is horrendously gruesome with many killed and wounded on both sides.
988;How the directors managed such realism is beyond me and shows the potential for the cinema in future films.
989;The rest of the movie follows his extremely melancholy life, in which wife and child are murdered, and he earns a reputation as one of the greatest gladiators in the arena.
990;For everyone else, though, this is definitely one of the best of all time, and you will miss out sorely if you never watch it.
991;One of the best movies of all time presented in the best format.
992;Fortunately, however, the blue ray is excellent.
993;Gladiator is right up there with BladeRunner, Alien, Conquest of Paradise and Legend as Ridley Scott's best.
994;Dead Can Dance) and Hans Zimmer follow in the tradition of great musical scores of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream.
995;It's a beautiful film
996;Maximus (Russell Crowe in a Oscar Winning Role) is the Most Powerful Roman General, loved by the People.
997;directed by Ridley Scott (G. i. Jane, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) made a Outstanding Film, filled with Great Visuals, A fine Cast and Music Score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (Also they were Oscar Nominated from thier Score).
998;Oscar Winner also for Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound and Best Costume Design.
999;Oscar Nominated for Best Art.
1000;direction, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay.
1001;I loved this movie, and will still watch it on occasion.
1002;It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!
1003;unlike any other Gladiator, is most touching and full of suspense, grief, longing, joy, and fulfillment.
1004;Russell Crowe is the reason this film won an academy award.
1005;dimensional and from the moment we meet him, he encompasses everything Maximus is supposed to be: a leader, a fighter, a farmer, a man who loves his family, a man of honor, and a spiritual man.
1006;It's so hard to actually put your finger on it, but his facial expressions and the way he delivers such lines as, what we do in life echoes in eternity and especially the speech where he states his name, loyal servant to the true emporer, Marcus Aurelis, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, .
1007;The music swells up, the crowd is cheering, the gladiators yell Maximus .
1008;A definite favorite movie moment for me.
1009;I do think Gladiator an average story and it is
1010;I do have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks and Ed Harris, but I must say I cheered when Russell took home the prize.
1011;Gladiator serves well to keep the tradition strong.
1012;The story of General Maximus of the Roman Empire is an inspiring journey of persaverence and elevation despite the odds.
1013;Without divulging any key information, subsequently this is when the fun begins .
1014;During his odyssey he is transformed into an entertainer for the masses who crave the blood and guts arena in which he performs.
1015;An overlooked screenplay is blanketed by the unreal vivid action scenes.
1016;These seat gripping scenes are ultra violent, but fit well within the context of the story.
1017;So, I feel comfortable attending this movie with a mature twelve year old.
1018;While the film's sweeping scope is best appreciated on the large screen, this transition to home video is most commendable.
1019;a reviewer of the movie's soundtrack on another site derided both Hans Zimmer's majestic score and Lisa Gerrard's exquisite vocal work.
1020;With a combined output of 65 film soundtracks, other successful projects, and numerous awards over thier respective 20.
1021;year careers, you think they'd be able to get it right by now.
1022;Gladiator will probably not garner the industry accolades that it deserves at the 2001 Academy Awards, but it will forever stand as one of the most impressive productions in motion picture history.
1023;As you've probably read from other reviews, there's a new Blu.
1024;dISC SET was above the logo on the actual case itself.
1025;as for the transfer itself, it's really quite astounding.
1026;one of the best, most detailed, most richly filmic Blu.
1027;ray have this new transfer, with a yellow UPC bar or something, or a new release altogether, promoting the new, greatly refined video master.
1028;Russel Crowe stars in this awesome epic of the late Roman Empire, and the treachery that riddled within it.
1029;Crowe, stars as general Maximus, the dedicated soldier of Rome, ever ready to die for his cause.
1030;Great movie, a classic,I loved everything about it!
1031;The cinematography is really good and Russell Crowe is amazing as always.
1032;Gladiator is a fine, well made film which offers great entertainment and some excellent performances.
1033;the acting is fine in Gladiator.
1034;Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus
1035;and I'll concede he's far superior to Stephen Boyd's equivalent character Livius in Fall.
1036;But the greatest pleasure for me was to be found in veteran actors Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed in what was sadly his final role as Proximo.
1037;Reed reminds us once again of the genuine talent so often obscured by the public persona in his portrayal of the callous gladiator school owner who regains his humanity.
1038;A simple shot of a terrified man urinating himself in fear captures the horror perfectly.
1039;man fights you get the right movie.
1040;hats of to Ridley Scott for what will be a long awaited and deserved Oscar for Best Picture and Director.
1041;What can I say, it has potential for Best Actor: Russell Crow, Best Supporting Actor: Joachim Phoenix or Richard Harris, Best Actress: Connie Nielsen, Original Score: Zimmerman (that's a guarantee), Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Cinematoraphy and the list goes on.
1042;This movie has the potential to win the most oscars of any single film to date because it will grab the special effects awards traditionally given to sci.
1043;Rome and the Coliseum are nicely recreated.
1044;the movie is 2 hours 30 minutes, and is captivating throughout.
1045;I found every bit of dialog to be gripping, interesting, and vital to the story.
1046;this film worth owning to view again and again.
1047;From the beginning to the end of Gladiator, it is a true masterpiece of cinematic genius.
1048;Ridley Scott has outdone himself again.
1049;The visuals are stunning and action sequences are awesome.
1050;There is actually a love story for the girlfriend and wives to stay glued to the screen.
1051;Russel Crowe is outstanding as Maximus, and the supporting cast is very good.
1052;There's lots of spectacle here, and a reasonably compelling story dealing with honor, love, and revenge.
1053;Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the villain, and certainly deserves his Oscar.
1054;nomination.Yet, I must say that when I saw this film last summer, I ate my popcorn, enjoyed the picture, then went home and quickly forgot about it.
1055;possibly because I followed it up with BEN HUR, an infinitely better Roman epic.
1056;which is, quite simply, one of the finest films in the history of world cinema (AND which has far better swordplay).
1057;Russell, Joaquin, and Ridley went together and made it an awesome movie, a must see.
1058;Maximus gives a great performance.
1059;That's why i give this awesome movie 2 thumbs and 2 toes way up!!!
1060;It brought Ridley Scott back in a big way.
1061;And it brought big bucks into the box office.
1062;Gladiator is a really good film.
1063;Here is a great film villain that we almost sympathize with because what makes him tick is so clearly portrayed to the audience.
1064;along with a refreshingly original score, beautiful cinematography, a star making performance by Crowe, and amazing battle scenes, Gladiator has become one of the top contenders for Oscar this year.
1065;Does it deserveb the top prize?
1066;But its better than alot of other films this year.
1067;This is magnificent storytelling via film, from international cast and crew, through landscape, score, film and editing techniques.
1068;In the ring, his skills, ruthlessness and sometimes arrogance were very pleasing to watch.
1069;And the creator of Gladiator did an excellent job in getting these facts across without actually coming out and saying it.
1070;the acting of this movie was also superb.
1071;The two main charatcters played by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix did spectacular jobs with there roles.
1072;Crowe had a very convincing performance assuming the role of Maximus.
1073;This movie is easily in the top 5 of my all time favorites.
1074;The music and the story will do that to you.
1075;And, what a grand entrance.
1076;But, this one does wonders for you!
1077;i was enthralled by the production value, and also the tremendous acting of the stars russell crowe and others who i feel truly made me feel like i was part of the early roman empire.
1078;I enjoy history, so this movie really appeals to me!
1079;Return to ancient Rome as we follow one man's life from noble general, to owned slave to triumphant gladiator.
1080;Bring on the fights!We follow Maximus, a general for Rome, and very good friend of the Emperor.
1081;He builds a big reputation and gets to fight in Rome's Colliseum to get revenge.
1082;I feel 100% pleased to have bought it in blue ray.
1083;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1084;If you love action and the roman period, this movie is a must.
1085;You have to really be interested in ancient Rome to enjoy this movie.
1086;I also found the storyline hard to follow.
1087;The composer did an excellent job with the soundtrack.
1088;Cool musical score by Hans Zimmer, Lots of special features, Spectacular cinematagraphy, Nicely choreographed fight battle arena scenes, And a great performance by Russel Crowe Connie Nielsen.
1089;Joahquin Phoenix seemed too scary for playing the part of the emperor but the movie came together nicely.
1090;Still I would recommend movies about ancient Rome from the 1950's.
1091;My favorite one from that era was Cleopatra.
1092;This is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen.
1093;The story is clear, the sound is great and the actors are great.
1094;One of the best movie you will ever see.
1095;It also has two of the best acting performance s all time.
1096;One review creates a wave of 1 stars just
1097;Bought it for my mother she likes it.
1098;I've never watched it but she was happy with it so.
1099;I have viewed this movie and find it to be perfectly acceptable.
1100;interesting other reviewers are using technical terms for equipmentrequired to reduce grain in film to even make it possible to fit ona BD disk at all.
1101;One has to hand it to Ridley Scott, it took some major balls to make a film like this.
1102;And the biggest surprise is that he actually pulled it off.
1103;If nothing else, Gladiator is simply a visual masterpiece .
1104;overflowing with grand palaces, spectacular battles, fearsome gladiatorial contests, and a massive re.
1105;The story, concocted by a team of screenwriters including the literate William Nicholson, is pure potboiler.
1106;The best parts of the script are the wry comments on the nature of entertainment and politics, and the way public opinion can be manipulated in either arena.
1107;This is a nice sardonic touch, although with millions of dollars on the line, Scott is busy rattling his own sword.
1108;gladiator's literary narrative is perfectly balanced by the strength of its visual style.
1109;enhanced shots of the virtual Roman landscape are full of detail, from the statuary and columns of the Forum to the retractable velarium sun roof over the freshly minted Colosseum.
1110;There are a few cracks in the film's magnificent faade.
1111;It may bear some flaws and familiar elements, but Gladiator's script is a great story well told, evading the clich s one might expect (facing your best friend in the ring, etc.) and staying completely one.
1112;Scott also adds spiritual resonance to Maximus' journey, elevating a simple quest for revenge to a Homeric search for inner peace via surreal dream sequences and subtle motifs.
1113;The most affecting symbol is the very first the audience sees .
1114;a gauntleted hand gently caressing a wheat field.
1115;Though initially inconsequential, by the film's end, this image becomes one of the more haunting in recent memory.
1116;Such touches give Gladiator a soul, placing the film in the lower pantheon of cinematic greatness.
1117;, but Gladiator, with its epic scope and execution, easily deserves the 'Best Picture' nod over the smug amd self.
1118;The digital effects are perfectly excecuted.
1119;The main character Maximus is played by Russell Crowe, who in my opinion did a good job of acting out the illustrious personality of Maximus.
1120;Joaquin did a good portrayal of the emperor, who is known in the history books to probably have been insane and obsessed with gladatorial sport.
1121;Joaquin did a great job in my opinion, and his portraying of the Commodus was mostly accurate to the history books.
1122;However, this is a great movie, and it is well acted and has a great plot.
1123;It might not be able to satisfy the regular history buff, but it can satisfy the normal American, which is what has made this such a great film.
1124;This movie is simply awesome.
1125;Great direction, sets, plot, dialogue, and acting.
1126;another great film, and Will Durant (the historian) was an advisor on it.
1127;It's a very good movie.
1128;The fight scenes were good, except the camera wouldn't say on one spot long enough.
1129;It was very dizzying and jumpy.
1130;The ending was very nicely done, one of the best parts of the movie as he's making his way into the Elysium Fields.
1131;A good movie worth seeing, but don't watch it with any prior expectations.
1132;Gladiator has more than one of those.
1133;movie worth its salt has to have plenty of combat, and Ridley Scott's film is no disappointment.
1134;but every twenty minutes or so, a massive fight scene breathes new life (and death) into the picture.
1135;It's not a flawless movie, but it's pretty rich in detail for an action epic.
1136;It's gratifying to see such a monster action.
1137;And the colors are striking.
1138;I don't even remember it looking this good on the theater screen.
1139;This was a a good telling of an old story and the visuals are wonderful.
1140;Anyway it is well done.
1141;I believe this is one of the top 10 over.
1142;This is an action packed portrayal of the old Greek and Roman times.
1143;Russel Crow is as always fantastic.
1144;As for Crowe: if you have any doubts about his acting ability, please see Romper Stomper (1993).
1145;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1146;Great special effects, but you've probably already heard that.
1147;Just too many good points to list here.
1148;This is a modern take on the Gladiator movie.
1149;A Roman general, Maximus, has loyally served on the German front.
1150;When a new and jealous Caesar, Commodus, ascends the throne, he orders Maximus and his family killed.
1151;this is a typical story in terms of epic filmaking, and this film is most definitely an epic.
1152;generated recreation of the Colliseum, it's a treat to watch and soak in the atmosphere.
1153;The performances are uniformly good .
1154;Crowe was probably better in the Insider, but won his Oscar here as Maximus.
1155;It's a good thing Crowe can sustain interest, as he's onscreen something like 85% of the time!
1156;The supporting performances are also good.
1157;In gladiator two of hollywood's best faces (Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe) join forces to deliver one of the most outstanding films of this century and took movie making to a whole new level.
1158;this film has plenty of intense fighting scenes with all the fights being fast, hard.
1159;And every single fight sequence is unique from the others.
1160;which will please most people, great characters like Crowe and Phoenix, authentic storytelling, believable special effects.
1161;This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image.
1162;driven action films I've ever seen.
1163;Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail and art direction.
1164;In conclusion this movie sure delivers on a wide range of aspects which have been explained.
1165;A few historical inaccuracies, but the story line is engaging once you forgive the writers of thier sins.
1166;up of this movie, the cinematography, the special effects and of course the acting of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are just fabulous.
1167;It was exactly the same thing with The Matrix: Love is so great, love is so strong, it can wake the dead(Neo).
1168;In The Gladiator, love, loyality and believe in honour is so strong that, although the hero dies, everything is good, great and beautiful in the end and after we shared a tear or too, because of the unfair way, his life has ended, we know, thta now the hero can be happy with his family in heaven.
1169;Although I know, that won't help, I thank you for your attention!!!
1170;I'm going to keep this somewhat short, and sweet.
1171;Ridley Scott directs this Roman epic, and he enlists the talents of Russell Crowe as the lead character, Maximus, a General in the Roman Army.
1172;This film grips the viewer and holds them intensely right from the beginning, with a battle scene so fierce it will draw comparisons to the scenes from Mel Gibson's Braveheart.
1173;Crowe's performance in Gladiator is the best performance given by an actor since, once again, Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in his classic, Braveheart.
1174;Crowe's dialogues are just perfect for delivery, tone, volume, everything.
1175;Body actions match precisely to his words, and much is the same for the rest of the characters.
1176;Now, Scarface is my favorite movie of all time, and after that movie, few have been able to list as classics on my all.
1177;In order (1.5) my favorite movies of all time are: 1.
1178;To put Gladiator into this position, in my opinion, is a testament to the movie, its makers, and its actors.
1179;Oh, and see if you can spot WWF's The Rock as one of the Gladiators.
1180;Thats why he always won.
1181;as much of a Sacrilege to history this movie presented, the plot is nevertheless compelling and the visuals are extraordinary.
1182;Russell Crow was believable as a fierce gladiator with a moral a conscience outside the arena.
1183;in conclusion, Ridley Scott basically patched some facts together and made a fictional story.
1184;The story, the cinematography, the acting
1185;but you know what, I sure enjoyed it!With a small disclaimer by Ridley Scott before the film, letting the viewer know that this is not a director's cut, the movie still plays through weaving an even more elaborate and engaging story.
1186;I had a blast exploring the new bonus features (including an original abandoned opening titles sequence) and rediscovering the movie that changed my life.
1187;He is a hero, and at least out there in the field he should be untouchable.
1188;He escapes, and travels back to Italy to protect his wife and children from the new Emperor's wolves.
1189;Note that this happens in central Italy, right in the heartland of the Roman Empire (for Christ's sake!)
1190;With a gigantic Hollywood budget at hand, you had a chance to resurrect old Rome in all its glory, and offer a satisfying and plausible story along with it.
1191;for those still considering watching it, here is my recommendation: do so at your own peril, and only if all you care about is action and .
1192;breathtaking reconstructions of the eternal city.
1193;This was one of the best movies I have ever seen (on par if not better than Braveheart).
1194;The blend of plot, action, drama, and special effects was perfect and Russell Crow was amazing, the ultimate hero/champion.
1195;This is my favorite movie of all time and I can't rate this movie high enough because it's just that good,written,and produced.
1196;plus Ridley Scott got his A Game back with this movie.
1197;I received this movie as a present having never seen it in the theatre.
1198;I loved this film and am so glad it got the Oscar, it was a triumph of cinema, drama and music.
1199;I love Ancient Greek and Roman history and this film depicted Rome SOOOO well.
1200;What a great piece for Oliver Reed to end his career with.
1201;A genuine epic of all times and despite long exposure scenes, a breath catching sort.
1202;This is an excellent movie with great acting, a well thought out plot, and a beautiful score (Hans Zimmer Lisa Gerrard).
1203;The 200+minute documentary is amazingly in.
1204;depth in many aspects of the film, but is astonishingly deficient in one significant area: CASTING.
1205;Features on weapons, costumes, the conception and writing, visual effects are all extraordinarily in.
1206;The movie promises much, and it delivers.
1207;I recommend also that you watch this movie in conjunction with Spartacus.
1208;I've been hooked ever since.
1209;In this film Russell glows, he reaks of star, he oozes forward with OSCAR written all over him.Yes, there are other films that Russell owned, like A Beautiful Mind and the recent Cinderella Man, but this is what really got him noticed.
1210;The story here is quite good for an action film, considering most action films lack (there are a few exceptions, like Armegedon and The Matrix for example) There is pure emotion portrayed here by the entire cast, but notibly moreso in Crowe and Phoenix.
1211;ridley Scott brilliantly placed this film together and made one of the best films I've ever seen.
1212;The battle's and fights are amazing and very well put together.
1213;I would recommend to anyone.
1214;and now, my new review:Maximus (Crowe) is a loyal general of the Roman army, a man devoted to serving his country, a man who left behind his loved ones to serve the Emperor Marcus Arelious (I know I butchered the spelling).
1215;The film is spot on with a tight script and impressive acting on all fronts, a film that delivers solid action with an emotinal sucker punch.
1216;Much praise for Crowe who gives us a look at an amazingly strong man, one who can rise above what he's been redused to in order to free himself from the pain.
1217;If you have not watched the movie take the time and watch it.
1218;Gladiator is one of the classic movies that you do need to see.
1219;The movie is tense and you can say that it is emotional.
1220;This is one of my favorite Russel Crowe movies.
1221;The acting and action are superb, as is the story itself.
1222;this beautifully executed, gorgeously photographed and wonderfully acted film is also (unfortunately) almost totally unoriginal.
1223;There will be few surprises for those who have seen such films as the two versions of Ben.
1224;ridley Scott makes it all palatable to modern audiences who have come to expect large doses of snazzy computer graphics and frenetic action scenes (with the concomitant sprinklings of realistic gore).
1225;Here Scott brilliantly employs the strobe effect photography which Spielberg put to good use recently in his Saving Private Ryan.
1226;top, with Crowe easily disposing of five or six heavily armed opponents without even breaking a sweat .
1227;glaring incongruities, and often unintentionally laughable, in an otherwise beautifully detailed and painstakingly accurate treatment.
1228;if you haven't seen the aforementioned films, this film may delight you from beginning to end.
1229;Keep up the good work.
1230;Cast is amazing and so are the action scenes.
1231;Gladiator is an astonishing success .
1232;Mel Gibson played a similar character in Braveheart (lone man takes on the aristocracy to avenge the death of his wife), but with much more verve and energy than Crowe musters here.
1233;It won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (over Traffic and Crouching Tiger!)
1234;Of the two, it's the only Sapphire title worthy of its name.
1235;Discover the paralleled power and glory of the Gladiator, a dazeling combination of vivd action and extraordinary unforgettable epic motion picture.
1236;This movie is simply magnificent and just mind catching it is just spectacular.
1237;Later on he becomes a gladiator and fights and is seen by all, that he is a skilled fighter and earns the respect of the people and his fellow fighters.
1238;he is then carried out of the area by his fellow fighters and friends and his death turns him into a Colisiom star and that is why I give the gladiator a five star rating and is a breathtaking and is a must see and own movie.
1239;Loved the movie, great acting and great plot and overall just great movie to sit down and watch with spouse or buddies or if your bored.
1240;The plot on this movie will move you.
1241;It's a well known movie compared to brave heart with its emotional content.
1242;I enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
1243;I assume the reasoning behind this is that a movie with such commerical appeal can't possibily be the best picture of the year.
1244;russell Crowe, fresh off his career best performance in The Isider, stars as Maximus, a Roman general whose influence over his men threatens the ascension to the throne of emperor.
1245;And upon their intial battle Maximus, known as The Spaniard to his fellow slaves, shows that he has some life.
1246;He and a handful of others scathe off death merely to find themselves fighting for their lives once again, this time in front of a blood thirsty crowd at the Roman Coliseum.
1247;life performance sells us on the plausibility.
1248;The characters are strong, independent and propel the plot.
1249;It's a profound film with subtle, meaningful messages that can at times be overlooked because of all the eye.
1250;this is a recurring theme for Ridley Scott, whose film credits include Alien and Hannibal.
1251;But in Gladiator he's found his most mature material to date and, besides, it's kind of hard to hold that against him when you see the grandeur of the world in which he's created, and in which we inhabit for it's two and a half hour running time.
1252;It's a superlative achievement and I'm sure it would have been recognized as such in any year, no matter how competitive.
1253;based summer blockbuster that can connect with it's audience without having to skimp on the plot.
1254;Crowe does a fantastic acting job here.
1255;Gladiator has many ups and downs.
1256;This film is an entertaining visual splash that I believe succeeds quite splendidly.
1257;If you love action films, the wonderfully choreographed combat scenes that star Crowe and his Roman short sword are spectacular.
1258;Crowe's performance, on the other hand, is quite good.
1259;The scenes that show Rome at its height are impressive and I enjoyed the transformed time period of this film.
1260;Gladiator is a summer blockbuster that is a fun film, a movie that can be watched over and over again.
1261;off a psychologically driven, Shakespearian plot, it manages to lay out one of the more enriching action films of recent years.
1262;his acting is solid, believable, and heartfelt.
1263;The story is gripping, with the fallen leader rallying his fellow gladiators to freedom.
1264;action scenes have great replay value.
1265;Sometimes I just fast forward straight to the epic battle scenes.
1266;i bought this movie for my wife because shs wore out the first one she had,great movie,great price what more can i say
1267;The recent dramatic epic Gladiator has already won two golden globe awards for it's stellar impact on the public.
1268;old one: a rags to riches biographical look at an innocent civilian who wakes up every day feeling very grateful to have that day.
1269;For this reason, Maximus not only was a physical gladiator, but he was a rare mental genius.
1270;russell Crowe's performance seemed to be very Oscar.
1271;worthy , showing a significant amount of emotion and feeling in his role as the gladiator that overcame all odds that were set against him.
1272;With the acting job done by Russell, it is a believable story, but it really could only ever happen once.
1273;The transition of the time periods was just exceptional, bringing back the time period just as it was said to be.
1274;Gladiator really grabs you and pulls you in, and makes the unbelievable a reality.
1275;The plot is original in most respects although it is not for the faint of heart.
1276;I would recommend it to anyone and everyone as the casting was excellent and the scenery was extremely well designed and chosen.
1277;The movie was very well shot.
1278;That shot has always bothered me.
1279;so that's pretty much Gladiator: equal parts saucy historical epic and revenge flick, Kill Bill with a toga and a gladius instead of shades and a katana.
1280;it's the sort of soaring, riveting, exotic concoction Hollywood was born to do: use classical history as grandpa's attic, ransack it, gussy it up, inject gobbets of gore and glory and a huge dose of trashiness into it, and in the end just dump the entire audience down the chute into the steaming, sandy vortex of a Roman gladiatorial pit.
1281;Gladiator is basically just 1964's epic Fall of the Roman Empire with a fresh coat of paint and some nifty CGI.
1282;tigers, and with all the eye.
1283;at any rate, this version looks gorgeous, and is there anything.
1284;that is as glorious as pumping up the volume on the big arena fight until you can rock the rafters of the house two counties over?Everything is quick, deadly, stylish, and tantalizingly rustic: all the high style (courtesy of Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathiesen, with a martial, exotic score mustered up by Hans Zimmer) cloaks the fact that Gladiator pretty much boils down to two brilliantly.
1285;russell Crow broods and glowers, and the flick is ninety shades of electric when he's at the center of it.
1286;hmmm) manages to be shockingly, mouth.
1287;wateringly beautiful in a scant role.
1288;In that regard, Gladiator succeeds wildly.
1289;Russell Crowe was a good actor for this part.
1290;I loved the way that the story was told and the outcome of the film.
1291;Watch it and make your own decision.
1292;This looks very good on blu.
1293;which isnt saying anything bad at all since i loved that movie to.
1294;I thought the movie was excellent, and I probably couldn't add anything new to what others have already said about it.
1295;It is a well thought.
1296;out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than an action movie.
1297;It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards.
1298;If you are looking for an epic film with a great actor, beautiful direction and gorgeous cinematography, this movie by Ridley Scott is for you.
1299;Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of the Oscar he received as the honorable general Maximus, who is betrayed by the scheming and evil, Commodus, son of the dead emperor of Rome, played perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix.
1300;Through honor, his strength brings him the respect of the citizens of Rome, who eagerly watch the bloody sport in which he is forced to participate.
1301;Connie Nielson is also good as the sister of Commodus, and former love of Maximus, who has to deal with the incestuous advances of her brother and his maniacal treatment of the citizens of Rome.
1302;The extras are insightful and the sound is nothing short of spectacular.
1303;The price was great also.
1304;Gladiator has always been one of my favorite movies.
1305;Upon closer inspection, I found that the words 2 Disc Set did not appear above the Paramount logo on the back, right.
1306;I opened it, and compared the number on the back, inner.
1307;The scenery and sets were magnificent .
1308;According to the texts, Commodus accompanied his father on the German campaigns and shared in the triumphs and victories.
1309;Annia Lucilla was actually one of the 13 children, of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger, and the sister of Commodus.
1310;It was a touching story and a good performance by the leading actor .
1311;i enjoyed the movie and would give it 4 stars for entertainment, performances and sets.
1312;I bought it again and this time the transfer was excellent.
1313;finally a good movie with a great actor in it.
1314;good plot and a look into the way it probably was back then.
1315;Let's start by saying that Gladiator is the first great film of the new millenium and maybe the best film of the decade, so far, period.
1316;There are not enough superlatives to describe how great this film is.
1317;Kudos all around to director Ridley Scott, his superb technicians, and the excellent ensemble cast lead by the break.
1318;This film has passion, it has spectacle.
1319;Gladiator is a throwback to the epics that were made years ago before the costs made them prohibitive.
1320;What makes these effects more special is that similar technologies were utilized to evoke the classical period for the so.
1321;CGI is okay but you have to have a decent movie, as Gladiator proved.
1322;In this film the effects are in the service of a great story and some great acting.
1323;This film is a fitting epitaph for his career.
1324;It contains some good extra material on the technical attributes of the film as well as an extraordinary documentary about the real.
1325;The good points
1326;The fight scenes are exciting but meaningless.
1327;Maybe when I see A Beautiful Mind , I'll find out.
1328;Go to google and type in The Christian Martyr's Last Prayer to see an accurate painting of this, with the priest intoning the psalms surrounded by Christians in prayer.
1329;The story is engaging, while the acting throughout is as superb as the film is graphically violent.
1330;This film truly brings ancient Rome to life, and while there is much violence, the few peaceful scenes are quite powerful in their own right.
1331;There are numerous extras which are a treasure chest of information and insight to anyone interested in the making of Gladiator.
1332;This was one of the best movies i have seen for one simple fact.
1333;This movie showed more depth and meaning by staying with one guideing principle and i loved it!
1334;Even though it does seem to borrow from Braveheart quite a bit, Gladiator still stands on its own as one of the best movies of 2000.
1335;So DreamWorks piled all the extras, and there are a lot of them, onto a second disc, in an innovative package that is the same size as a single disc box.
1336;the extras disc is packed!
1337;Deleted scenes, storyboards, a making.
1338;of documentary, some gladiator history, a feature on the score, stills, a diary written by the young actor who plays Lucius, and much, much more!All I can say is that if you've made it this far, you will love this movie!
1339;Spartacus had great actors, relevant political themes and had several powerful philosophical ideals running through the story.
1340;I loved the scene where Spartacus and the man he was going to fight to death in the arena were sitting together while 2 other gladiators fought outside their holding pen.
1341;I have to keep in mind that this is a first generation blu.
1342;while I read a lot about the exchange program I was skeptical about taking the chance.

1345;i'm not sure if this belonged in the review section are a forum
1346;This is by far Russell Crowe's best performance.
1347;This is a must watch and a must have movie for movie enthusiasts.
1348;This is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.
1349;It has all of the criteria for a great epic film, betrayal, revenge, romance.
1350;Of course, there's a fair share of gore in the film, but the emotions brought on by the film far outweighs the Hollywood Terminator style of photography.
1351;Surely, it will do the same for you.
1352;* The movie was Zulu with Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins.
1353;The holiday price was finally right to gift myself this disc.
1354;There is a good balance between the two.
1355;There were several twists in the plot to keep my interest on how the Gladiator was going to win back his status in the empire.
1356;I found the movie to be in a similar style to the HBO Rome series.
1357;screen and a room I can get pretty dark during the day.
1358;This film was beautiful to watch, and there were no playback issues (Panasonic DMP.
1359;All in all, a fantastic film that is worth watching in Blu.
1360;please read the other reviews for a technical explanation.
1361;After watching Gladiator for the third time, I found myself as interested and attentive as I was during the first viewing.
1362;It IS the best movie of the year and next go.
1363;around
1364;A top to bottom brilliant movie!
1365;An excellent solid addition to ones sand and sandals collection of films.
1366;i also enjoyed the extras, and was wondering why some of those scenes were left out, like the meeting between the senators and priscilla's character.
1367;but in any case, even now in december, without having seen crouching tiger, hidden dragon yet, gladiator is still the best movie of the year and i hope it is well honored at the oscars.
1368;This is a great movie for adults that are not squeamish.
1369;The one I identified with most was the loyal soldier/family man, who above all seeks to discharge his duties as a soldier and husband/father honorably.
1370;the acting of Russell Crowe is perfect for this role, but I could imagine many of Hwood's best doing a good job in such a well.
1371;the cinematography is exemplary and really propels a great tale to the next level.
1372;GLADIATOR is riveting cinema, the kind of movie that grabs you by the throat.
1373;The stakes are high, the ancient Roman Empire stunningly recreated, and the body of Maximus is . . . well, buff Russell Crowe.
1374;This is pure entertainment, as much gory spectacle as the Roman gladiator contests in the Colliseum.
1375;loving you thought you were.
1376;i found it ironic .
1377;He has a beautifully thick neck and fine muscular build like the expatriated American Aussie who paved the way for other actors from Down Under.
1378;Despite his fragility, he is still elegant of voice, and clear of mind as he wisely chooses Maximus to succeed him.
1379;Harris is still impressive to watch onscreen because in the body of this frail.

1383;a statuesque natural beauty, who can play very strong.
1384;willed characters with aplomb, and comfort the hero during his final hours.
1385;The way Ancient Roman jewelry hangs on Ms. Nielsen is very graceful.
1386;But considering his relationship with Richard Harris in Camelot, it's interesting to see the two work together again.
1387;the arena scenes are fast.
1388;Humming through it all is an exotic score with a certain mysticism about it.
1389;ridley Scott directed this with as much intensity as was seen in 1492, and it is an intensity that has paid off for him.
1390;p>His performance is strong, stoic and yet very moving, showing a fine range.
1391;The secondary leads are magnificent, especially Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.
1392;The computer work more than convinces us of the 'cast of thousands' in the battle scenes and the arena.
1393;it's great to see this sort of historical drama once again being made and receiving such recognition.
1394;I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and now it is out on blu.
1395;If you loved the original, you will be so happy with this copy.
1396;I highly recommend it for anyone's collection.
1397;I cannot say enough good things about this movie, it is without a doubt the finest film I have ever seen (sorry Citizen Kane).
1398;It is important for those who have not seen the film to understand that this isn't a kill them all type film.
1399;This film has a fantastic story, compelling characters, and a soundtrack that Mozart would be proud of.
1400;The music should have gotten the best supporting actor, because it completely captures the emotions of the characters, especially Maximus.
1401;It is played when he is praying, but it also comes about when the group wins its first fight in Rome during the Battle of Carthage at a much higher tempo.
1402;Maximus got to be with his family at the end of the movie, which was his goal at the beginning, he got what he wanted.
1403;This is a true epic, I could go on for days.
1404;(I still shed a tear at the end when they carry him, not because I am sad, but because of the respect and honor they give him.
1405;ray to enjoy the film in crisp visuals.
1406;A film of epic proportion matched by digital technology that leaves the watcher ensconced in a world where to maim and kill is to succeed and survive.
1407;Russell Crowe exudes strength, and intelligence, with a winning ability to lead men as empires fall at his feet.
1408;the schemes and intrigue that takes place in the darkness of the night, along with the subtle threats that initiate the treachery among family members keeps you craving that justice which is robustly delivered by director Ridley Scott.
1409;What a satisfying pleasure it will be to witness justice at its finest hour.
1410;this Academy Award nominated film is certainly a 5 star production and a movie that will stand the test of time.
1411;sound alone leaves you feeling like part of the crowd as they stomp and cheer for the Gladiators.
1412;Other movies of interest directed by Ridley Scott include Blade Runner and Alien.
1413;i think this movie is diffeniately of epic porportions and is the epitome of great movie making with a colidoscope of emotions.
1414;Supported by a fine cast which includes Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix in a break.
1415;through role, Connie Nielsen, the late Richard Harris and Oliver Reed plus I Claudius Derek Jacobi, Gladiator will dazzle and entrance you.
1416;ray edition of this fine film from Frys and despite the negative reviews of the Blu.
1417;ray, I still found the film watchable and definitely an upgrade from the Standard def version.
1418;ray transfer of this classic.
1419;Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery.
1420;It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.
1421;Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus.
1422;The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better.
1423;since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good.
1424;With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time.
1425;the acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors.
1426;Russell Crowe is now one of the best new (four or five films so far) actors in film.
1427;We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus.
1428;He carries the film in the second.
1429;His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent.
1430;He commands attention just as Crowe does.
1431;but the acting is so good that it seems they are.
1432;now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense.
1433;It has diversity and grandeur.
1434;And every single fight sequence is unique from the others.
1435;This is so much more than just two half.
1436;The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat.
1437;Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive.
1438;During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters.
1439;This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image.
1440;driven action films I've ever seen.
1441;Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue).
1442;Cinematography is skillful and impressive.
1443;the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc.
1444;I forgot how good this movie was.
1445;It is a great movie for those man.
1446;The sweeping and involving story line really grabs you and carries you away.
1447;The amazing transfer is one of the best on the market.
1448;The first disc is the feature and the detailed commentary by Ridley Scott.
1449;While the second disc is tv spots, trailers , documentary's and my personla favorite delted scenes.
1450;The seven minute montage is also a wonder.
1451;From the opening scene, I knew that this was going to be an incredible movie.
1452;hur the most, and it's equally as good.
1453;the action is stupendous as well as the story line.
1454;This movie will surely please you.
1455;From sound track to cinematography, this movie proves itself as a top.
1456;Loved it before but now seeing the extended parts truly is great.
1457;It's bloodier, it's even more complete and now you can even get more out of the characters roles which enhances the movie as a whole and I just think it is great.
1458;It's an amazing film that gets better every time I watch it.
1459;Wonderful acting, great sets, stunning costumes, cool story.
1460;One of my favourite all time great movies.
1461;I can see why all the woman went Russell Crowe crazy!
1462;GLADIOTOR is an excellent motion picture.
1463;channel DOLBY DIGITAL Theatre, the perfect place to view a film of such scale.
1464;GLADIOTOR is the story of Loyalty, Betrayal, Deceit, broken love, and the demons that haunt a young man as he go's thru life having no choice but to murder innocent people, at the command of his master.
1465;Russel Crowe is very convinceing in the title role, and the supporting cast adds to the overall effect as well.
1466;Only this time, a bit more realistic, and with state of the art picture and sound.
1467;The Cinematography is excellent, never have I seen the city of Rome photographed so well.
1468;Instead, GLADIOTOR tells a story, one of pure excitment and majesty.
1469;Special effects mind blowing, well balanced wolfer and surrounds.
1470;Over all, GLADIOTOR is a film worth purchasing, and I wouldn't be suprised if it garners Oscar nominations.
1471;This is a very good movie and I advise everyone to see the movie.
1472;I especially liked the fighting scenes.
1473;The setting was awsome a brilliant film what else can I say
1474;Gladiator, played by Russel Crowe reveal in spectacular way the live of a Roman General (Elius Maximus Decimus Meridius), that lives just at the end of the time of the last Stoic Emperor (Marcus Aurelius).
1475;For the people who watch this movie with special attention and are really intrested in some historical facts (even if the argument is not completely true) will find the most grat movie ever made of the Roman Empire.
1476;the roles played, the action scenes, the combination between both of them makes this movie one of the jewels of the 7th.
1477;This is a great movie, Russell Crowe is wonderful as the Gladiator and Joaquin Phoenix is terrific as the Cesar.
1478;The fighting in the Coliseum is so well done!
1479;I find it amazing how they recreated the Coliseum and the fight scenes that took place in it.
1480;Although I had read some preview reviews, I am very impressed with this Blu.
1481;rays and this is one of the sharpest and color rich transfers I have seen so far.
1482;I think the anticipation of fans, put an extreme expectation on perfection for this transfer, as did the studio's touting of the superior nature of the Sapphire series.
1483;But those scenes were few and far between, for me, and the detail, starting from the opening battle scene, down to those where Maximus is walking through the fields, and daylight shots, the clarity and detail on this disc is amazing.
1484;The film remains one of my favorite films of all time, and it continues to be towards the top of my list for Drama films.
1485;The cast is at its best, and Ridley and all creative talent involved deserve every accolade bestowed upon this film.
1486;Most people have seen the movie and love it.

1495;Ridley Scott's latest film, Gladiator, takes a stab (literally) at this need, and succeeds for the most part.
1496;In terms of scale and wonder, the film is a very impressive and awe.
1497;inspiring achievement, one that leaps onto the screen with a roar instead of a whimper.
1498;You will drop your jaws over the spectacle of the film, but its soul will leave you untouched.
1499;taking historical time periods and working in a fictitious storyline can have its ups and downs.
1500;Here, the result is mostly a success, supposedly based on records from the actual days of Rome, about a man who started out as a general and went from being enslaved to being the most renowned gladiator to ever fight in front of an audience.
1501;Two sequences is enough for us to gather in what the days of Rome were all about, and each sequence is beautifully choreographed and staged for some very authentic and intense battle images.
1502;By all means, no, for it is a breathtaking period piece that showcases just exactly what Rome was all about in the past.
1503;the cast also fits nicely into their roles.
1504;Russell Crowe is perfect as Maximus, the ideal hero for one of those roles that the actor is born to play from day one.
1505;Connie Nielsen is honest and convincing in her role as Lucilla, even if her character has little to do but watch as her hero faces certain death (and even then, her performance is high.

1507;It's battle and fight sequences become a way of life by movie's end, but they are, nonetheless, visually stunning, as is the overall design of the film and the equally impressive acting.
1508;This film is fortunate in that it is built round the very strong central performance of Russell Crowe.
1509;The battle scenes are very ambitious, full marks to Scott for 'having a go' at showing what it is really like in battle, but the dubbed soundtrack, invasive music and good grief, even dialogue out of synch just make this look silly.2.
1510;This is his last chance for him to give the world his King Lear and he's obviously determined to make sure we get it!
1511;He's a fine actor, but his presence merely reminds us that the BBC has done Rome before, and better than this in I ClaudiusBut there are some merits to this film.
1512;Crowe does some of his best acting when he is silent.
1513;As any actor will tell you, this is the most difficult type of acting, and it is unusual for the lead character in a film to have so much of it.
1514;But Scott shows great sensitivity in lingering on Crowe's expressions for just long enough to convey the emotions, and credit must go to the editor for this.
1515;oliver Reed is just superb.
1516;the feeling of the bloodiness of battle and the empire is so well conveyed that you can almost smell the blood.
1517;the staging of the battle scenes and the skill of the stunt men is unquestionable.
1518;the scenes with the Gladiator riding cross country are good, reminiscent of the best scenes from Blackadder.
1519;If you don't believe me, watch it!
1520;in essence, that is all we as consumers of entertainment demand when we open a book or watch a movie.

1541;richard Harris does a surprisingly great job and his short performance sets the stage as Caesar Augustus .
1542;story:Rome's greatest general Maximus (Crowe) finds himself thrust into slavery when he narrowly escapes being murdered on the orders of Comodus (Phoenix).
1543;Because of his fierce fighting style, Rome loves the slave Maximux and Comodus cannot directly kill him.
1544;negatives:Some of the gladiator fights are detailed and therefore gory, so be careful who you see this film with.
1545;This film is a magnificent performance by one of the most intense actors on the screen today.
1546;Russell Crowe easily solidifies his name as one of the top actors of the day.
1547;The film is grand and Ridley Scott has definitely created a masterpiece in the same vein as Braveheart, El Cid, or Ben.
1548;Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and shows a strong range of acting ability.
1549;Crowe portrays a Roman Soldier and gladiator with a sense of honor that one would find in a Marine.
1550;It is truly a marvelous movie, and a masterpiece of a film.
1551;It is a great story from an incredible and epic time.
1552;A movie that has and will continue to survive the test of time.
1553;I love the war movies that are based on some truth, and I understand that pulling in things that weren't true make it a movie more love to watch.
1554;Gladiator in my opinion, is the greatest movie of all time!
1555;Russel Crowe has his best performance ever as Maximus Decimus Meridius.
1556;Other performances are great (Oliver Reed as Proximo, Harris as Marcus Aurelius, and Connie Nielson as Lucilla) but greatest thing about Gladiator is it's action sequences.
1557;music is great, special effects too.
1558;the vilain is really convincing and I do not regret waiting for the original uncut american version, rather than the german mutilated one.
1559;very well done, after all!GreetingsRobin
1560;This is an extraordinary epic which takes place at the end of the reign of the Antonine emperors.
1561;It's a magnificent story of a fictional character (a Roman General named Maximus, played by Crowe) who comes into contact with historical characters, such as Marcus Aurelius and his ignominious son, Commodus.
1562;There are also allusions to the great Roman orator Cicero (his name bequeathed to Maximus' servant) and the Gracchus brothers (Gracchus is the name of a benevolent senator in the film).
1563;There are also some nice references made to the Battle of Zama (in 202 .
1564;perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the film lies in its depiction of Aurelius Commodus.
1565;Aurelius is seen as a magnificent and magnanimous leader
1566;The presentation of his character in this movie brings that out exceptionally well.
1567;this is yet another instant classic directed by the creative genius of Ridley Scott.
1568;The film is well done the sets take you back to the height of the Roman empire.
1569;They could very well increase the viewer's enjoyment of this marvelous visual spectacle.
1570;so many excelent shot can be visualised in front of your naked eye.
1571;I would have enjoyed the movie more if they had both been eaten by lions.
1572;russel Crowe (in the Gooding Jr role) is terrific as General Maximus.
1573;His fine acting chops are supplemented well by his James T. Kirk.
1574;Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, and Ollie Reed are more than entertaining, and the special effects are nicely done.
1575;The other one star raters hit the mark perfectly.
1576;I love this movie and have been waiting since I got a Blu.
1577;2000's Gladiator is a visually stunning throw.
1578;back to an earlier era of epic movie.
1579;russell Crowe is outstanding as Maximus, the general who is favored by his Emperor (an excellent cameo by Richard Harris) to lead the Empire over his greedy and unstable son Commodus (played with over the top depravity by Joaquin Phoenix).
1580;A wise slave trader (Oliver Reed in his last film role) sees Maximus' potential and turns him into a gladiator.
1581;piece gladiator combats are thrilling and worth the movie by themselves.
1582;A superb supporting cast enhances the movie, notably Connie Nielson as the sister of Commodus and the object of his depraved desire.
1583;The recreation of Rome is detailed and authentic.
1584;The movie is highly recommended as good entertainment.
1585;Awesome movie, story, acting, etc.
1586;Just got my copy in the mail today.
1587;I can see the Dreamworks Execs foaming at the mouth.
1588;Too bad though as I really love the movie.
1589;I found it to be very interesting.
1590;There is also a look at some storyboards of scenes that never made it into the film.
1591;the movie itself is an epic blockbuster.
1592;Tons of awesome action sequences which keep you on the edge of your seat.
1593;I'm happy to say that the last four numbers are B1R2.
1594;This is one of my favorite movies and looks and sounds great on blu ray.
1595;Thestory was just as good.
1596;The sound onthis disc, will make you happy too!You won't want to miss this one!
1597;it tells of a head chef, played with great aplomb by Russell Crowe, who is part of the Roman empire's quest to spread pasta throughout Europe.
1598;After banishing the upstart Germans and their sausages, Russell wants to return home to and start up a hawker store and introduce the Sticky Rice to his local community (and Laksa as well .
1599;And so Russell is thrust into it!There are great waitering action sequences here.
1600;has a dash of sand in it.
1601;i watched this movie in my latin class and thoroughly enjoyed it.
1602;although not all is historically accurate, it comes close, and is a very intense movie.
1603;the music is amazing, also.
1604;gladiator is a good old.
1605;what is endearing about Gladiator is primarily embodied in the character of Maximus.
1606;He loves his family, he is loyal to the king, he fights for his ideals, he brings the smack down when necessary.
1607;i give Gladiator 4 stars because I feel that is accomplished all that it set out to but it could have set out to accomplish more.
1608;rate, I was especially impressed with the Battle of Carthage scene.
1609;lovers and casual viewers alike, this movie is a must.
1610;Gladiator is directed by Ridley Scott, and his exquisite use of shadow and tone are showcased in this film.
1611;Connie Nielson, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed also star in this film.
1612;What makes this movie so good, besides the great cinematography, are the strong characters.
1613;This film is as much about the choices people make in life and how this affects their lives, as the ebbs and flows of our existence.
1614;The film is mostly crisp and clear.
1615;This disc also has lots of extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with scholars about history, and commentary from Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but best of all is the inclusion of an extended cut which has sixteen extra minutes of deleted scenes.
1616;Those that enjoy this film may also want to check out HBO's Rome series which is a gritty depiction of Roman history around the time of Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra.
1617;While there are many historical stretches I enjoyed this movie for what it really is: entertainment.
1618;The scenery, set and costuming is excellent and well worth the money.
1619;Russell Crowe is the up and coming action hero and he lives up to it in this movie.
1620;If you enjoy action films, period pieces or your a history buff you'll find something to enjoy in the viewing!
1621;Sometimes it was possible to win your freedom.
1622;There is much graphic violence and I suggest you guard your mind because the movie presents a worldview full of ancestor worship, and 'all roads lead to heaven' philosophy.
1623;for a movie extolling the virtues of strength and honor as well as being full of adventure I highly recommend this film.
1624;No movie, including this one is worth over .
1625;Ah the good old days were not always so good and the virtuous did not always survive.
1626;Very exciting and very realistic and the extended version adds so much good detail.
1627;Probably the best thing about this film is that it turn you on yourself.
1628;So on one hand the film is entertaining.
1629;Gladiator is a movie with two faces
1630;this is a myth propogated by Hollywood.
1631;Something telling of the weakness of the director.
1632;Phoenix on the other hand had some great lines.
1633;Joaquin gave the best performance.
1634;and when we entered the colosseum, it really was an amazing sight.
1635;and the whole movie was great to watch.
1636;russel crowe is an amazing actor and you can definately see his talent in this movie.
1637;even though there were violent scenes that i found hard to watch, it is an excellent movie.
1638;This movie has now entered the pantheon of movies that you have to watch when you surf upon them.
1639;Gladiator is a good movie (although not as great as some would have you believe), and I highly recommend it.
1640;It is a fictional account based on historical people.
1641;The acting is spectacular, the music is stunning, the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and the costumes are accurately correct and original.
1642;I thought for sure it was going to.
1643;It has TONS of special features including millions of deleted scenes.
1644;Including how they made the movie, costumes, story, some history, about the cast, and MUCH more.
1645;I tell you now, this film is going to be a BIG contender at this year's Academy Awards.
1646;The beauty of this film is its ability to move you.
1647;The acting, the scenery, the story.
1648;it is rare that this kindof film come out of the hollywood woodwork.
1649;The visuals and audio are tops!
1650;Just because this is one of those film you will always want to see over and over again.
1651;watched this with our 18 year old son.
1652;Timeless classic, weboth really enjoyed it.
1653;Thanks for making it available.
1654;Russell Crowe is just amazing in his part as a famous general, then a slave, then a gladiator.
1655;I have watched it well over 30 times and each time I watch it I find something new, fun, and interesting that I had never seen before.
1656;Wonderfully casted, filmed, and directed, Gladiator is EASILY the best movie ever.
1657;In this case, it helps to flesh out the experience of Ridley Scott's truly brilliant film, making it even more exciting and moving.
1658;Regarding this BD edition, it's plenty of extra material and comes with the theatrical and extended edition, which is great.
1659;From the outside it looks great as most steelbooks.
1660;That's why I rated it with 3 stars.
1661;uNDER info about the first disc, IT IS CLEARLY STATED this is a widescreen version with 17 MORE MINUTES ( meaning extra footage in the movie itself).
1662;This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!!
1663;I had no idea that a movie could be this good!!
1664;Russell Crowe is my **FAVORITE** actor and he does a magnificent job in this film!!
1665;If you don't believe me, here's the PROOF that this is a great movie!!
1666;By far the story and action in this movie are well synchronized it is based on actual characters and truth.
1667;Marcus Aurealis dies one of the greatest of Roman Emperors and the last of the golden age of Rome.
1668;I believed that this story was stunning visually and dramatically, the effects were delicious with just enough gore, to provide with one of the best stories I have ever seen.
1669;I was moved countless times, by all the characters.
1670;the movies finale speaks for the entire film.
1671;The fight scenes are the best I've ever seen for that era if that's what you're seeking.
1672;the actors and acting is absolutely perfect, but with this cast to expect anything less?
1673;One of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
1674;This is a period movie well done.
1675;it felt very authentic and wisks you away to another time where one gets totally caught up in the moment as movie making should be.
1676;Seeing this for the first time today, it was greater than I could've ever imagined.
1677;i truly admire the film, the writer, the director, and the crew .
1678;They've done a superb work.
1679;Reviving a distant history tale to life is an admirable achievement I will always salute to.
1680;i'm trying to express here that the Gladiator is unique for representing the survival of the is right and honorary in a world that is crumbling apart, and that is running out of all the things people consider as good, true and justified.
1681;Whenever he can the man of honor in him evokes to show that he isn't completely corrupted, and forward, to show that this good side is his true self.
1682;In here, Maximus give us an example of endurance .
1683;and for that he deserves all the credit we can give him .
1684;maybe a moral of the story could be that if you fight hard you will eventually win .
1685;I'd like to believe it is true.
1686;Russell Crowe has created in me one more sincere hope it is achievable, and it's a great sucess for itself.
1687;in the end, he did win the Oscar price, he earned respectively.
1688;In all the other aspects this film is magnificent .
1689;I'm glad the film has won all those Oscars, evidently, the best film of last year ,and of course .
1690;ray version (Yellow UPC Code) is stunning, and the movie itself is very good.
1691;Because I am that disappointed that it got the award for best picture.
1692;Oh, the action sequences were great .
1693;Also much better is Traffic.
1694;This is an ACTION film, and we're supposed to be entertained by its action.
1695;packed images that would have our adrenaline overflowing.
1696;Ridley Scott sure knows how to mix action with drama.
1697;I was greatly inspired by not only the battle scenes (both in the forest and in the coliseum), but also the visual spectacle that is Rome.
1698;Yes, it's CGI, but it looks so beautiful.
1699;The acting is also a plus.
1700;Crowe, Nielsen, and Phoenix are excellent here, though I was devastated to see that Crowe won the oscar instead of Tom Hanks for Cast Away.
1701;But anyway, they're all brilliant I enjyoed watching this film very much.
1702;This movie script is remarkability well written and the execution of the idea from script to movie is done very well.
1703;this movie is a classic.
1704;for anyone who wants to watch an action packed, dramatic, and informative movie, this is a good one for you.
1705;maybe the best movie i have ever seen!
1706;Gladiator is an admirable film not only for its intense, elaborate, and realistic action, but also for its powerful underlying statement regarding human nature.
1707;Although the combat sequences are riveting, Scott deftly delivers a profound message of anti.
1708;I have always believed that it is better to appear ignorant in silence than to speak and remove all doubt!
1709;You wouldn't think so from the title and the expected action and fight scenes, but this is a beautiful epic.
1710;The love story behind it is lovely but bittersweet.
1711;Ridley Scott makes the characters come to life and he makes ancient Rome come to life.
1712;I went to see Gladiator with my friend for two reasons: 1) extra credit in Latin IV, 2) Russell Crowe.
1713;The first battle scene is amazing.
1714;So, for the boys: you'll love it for the fight scenes.
1715;fashioned epic that would enthrall audiences in the same manner that those aforementioned classics did.
1716;Gladiator is, honest to God, Scott's best film since Blade Runner .
1717;It's also his first major blockbuster.
1718;It offers a grand spectacle as well as a classically structured tale about honor and heroism.
1719;Few films can get away with being so, well, masculine.
1720;Scott's handling of the battle scenes is terrific.
1721;They are electric, exciting and oh so very bloody.
1722;Shot with elegance and adorned by a wonderful musical score (by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard).
1723;And then you have the cast.
1724;There is also Oliver Reed in his final performance as the slave trader Proximo.
1725;Reed brings such flavor and character to his supporting role, that he nearly walks away with the picture.
1726;It's a grand and eloquent swan song performance that reminds us all of what a great actor he was and how much poorer we are for losing him.
1727;seems sister and Djimon Hounsou (who made such an impact in Spielberg's underrated Amistad .)
1728;And at the center of it all is the star.
1729;Russell Crowe, one of the most exciting actors to appear in the last decade, proving once and for all that he can carry a picture.
1730;As Maximus, he delivers a performance of great richness and depth.
1731;This is a classic hero that you really want to root for, and Crowe has a gift for communicating his inner pain.
1732;He wants vengeance, but he also wants to set things right for Rome in the process.
1733;I love the little nuances that he brings to the role.
1734;type role model for a whole new generation of young moviegoers.
1735;The screenplay gives its characters plenty of grand melodramatic dialogues.
1736;If Crowe is the star, then Phoenix is the breakout success of this film.
1737;Joaquin is a richer, more complex actor than his brother ever was.
1738;And it makes for a couple of unwanted lulls when the film should just keep moving.
1739;But overall, Scott has put the whole package together so well, that one way or another you get caught up in this little Roman soap opera whether you like it or not.
1740;The film's way of handling that aspect of the story is so infectious, that by the time Maximus shouts at the coliseum: Are you not entertained?
1741;one almost feels like cheering right along with the crowd.
1742;it contains everyhing It has fun,romance,honour and violance.
1743;the best movie of the century.
1744;This movie epitomizes what a great movie should be.
1745;Compelling story, interesting characters, incredible action, tense drama.
1746;Great movie, watch it if you haven't!
1747;Russel Crowe does the BEST acting of his carrier, along with Jaquin Phoenix who does an extremely good job of a bone.
1748;The action is great, and their is little gratuitus violence.
1749;All I have to say is this movie was te best movie released so far this year.
1750;I was impressed witht the story and the action.
1751;As everyone has stated here, there is a lot of blood but because the movies is so well done and written you can almost look past those horrific scenes.
1752;I would recommend this movie to anyone and refund them there money if they did not like it becasue i am sure almost anyone will enjoy this movie.
1753;Product as described in perfect condition.
1754;Very happy with this seller!
1755;My sons thought this a great movie.
1756;I also wanted it set in an earlier Rome.
1757;the acting was excellent
1758;New Zeland born, Australian raised actor, Russell Crowe.
1759;what a terrific chance and choice he made.
1760;A star was born, and the movie Gladiator, was one of the most magnificent movies of the summer of 2000.
1761;Russell and Ridley made such an impact on the world.
1762;Russell won Best Actor, and Gladiato won Best Picture.
1763;it made such an impression on Hollywood and the World, that every Director decided to try their luck, to no avail.
1764;The only thing worth about this blue ray is the extra materials.
1765;It is one of the best in the swords and sandals genre.
1766;Of the many brought out in the 50's and 60's, only Ben Hur remains a true classic in my point of view.
1767;the actors are all very good and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris left a last legecy with their performances in this one.
1768;Thats how good it was.
1769;For all you that DON'T know, this is an excellent movie.
1770;The movie begins at the beginning of a great war scene.
1771;Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the general of the Romans, and he and his army triumph.
1772;These fight scenes that Maximus fights in are AMAZING and very real at the same time.
1773;Very violent, but entertaining nonetheless.
1774;It's what makes Gladiator a great movie.
1775;I won't tell any more of the story, you'll have to see it yourself.
1776;The acting is superb, the storyline/script is amazing and is actually TRUE, and it perfectly delineates what went on in ancient Rome.
1777;But it follows the true story, so I'll let it slide.
1778;Russell Crowe, along with Joaquin Phoenix give an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar nomination and destined to become one of the greatest epic depiction of one mans honor and strength versus the cowardly and deceptive self appointed emperor of Rome.
1779;director Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of telling this fabulous story.
1780;The first battle scene of the movie, where Rome is ready to end it's long battle and defeat and concur Germania is absolutely beautiful.
1781;It was one of the most beautiful scenes of this movie.
1782;The presence of leadership in Russell Crows character as well as his love for his family is definitely felt through out the entire film.
1783;Music is definitely one of the most important keys in the telling of any story.
1784;Hans Zimmer has composed for many films, but the music in this particular movie touches the audience and completes the task the director set out to do.
1785;The audience will absolutely loose them selves in this fantastic story.
1786;i rated this film with five stars for many reasons.
1787;The cinematography, the music, the story line, and the acting.
1788;I truly believe that if after seeing a movie, if I posses a desire to learn more about actual events similar to those in the film, than the director has done an excellent job and deserves all the recognition in world.
1789;My son loves this movie and was thrilled with this 3 disc set.
1790;Although it arrived the day after christmas, due to the weather my son was still in town and was very happy with the gift.
1791;Sorry, that just the way it is.
1792;An incredible film from start to finish.
1793;Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a wonderful, action.
1794;You definitely root for Russell Crowe's character and you want to know what happens to him
1795;There are highs in the movie.
1796;It is one of the few movies that is comparable to the likes of BRAVEHEART.
1797;This is a really great piece of fiction about the Roman Empire.
1798;Well, I like this movie as much as my fellow neighbour and has waited for this a long time, because it is one of the most sought after mainstream movies, that would deliver a stunning picture and awesome sound.
1799;The Braveheart title, also available on the Sapphire label is stunning.
1800;Gladiator is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype.
1801;hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios.
1802;With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, GI Jane) combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.
1803;This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.
1804;this is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact.
1805;His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate.
1806;He was also a great military leader and conqueror.
1807;By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond.
1808;Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five.
1809;This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.
1810;despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity.
1811;He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused.
1812;He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted.
1813;the most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome.
1814;These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins.
1815;The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle.
1816;This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.
1817;This film was a directorial masterpiece.
1818;Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development.
1819;This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob.
1820;Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason.
1821;His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess.
1822;This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role.
1823;At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.
1824;It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe.
1825;He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes.
1826;It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.
1827;trotting production with his pal and director Ridley Scott.
1828;The men seem to be having a great time, especially when busting on co. star Joaq Phoenix, a nervous Nellie during filming.
1829;Among the best is a new documentary that, unbelievably, rarely drags over its three.
1830;It captures director Scott making battlefield decisions: I need something really brutal.
1831;The visual effects team shows how their digital resurrection of the actor averted $26 million in reshoots.
1832;widescreen visuals on a DreamWorks test disc were first.
1833;Also the detail in the picture and the sound are great.
1834;Some background information is good but when there is an abundance like this set, stand back and enjoy the ride.
1835;The story line and actors chosen for this epic were excellent choices.
1836;If you liked Spartacus (1960) you'll love The Gladitor (2000).
1837;This a great movie, but it lacks the power of Braveheart.
1838;It is one of my 20 favorites though
1839;What I have noticed is that the grand scale of epics has diminished mostly in the past ten years.
1840;Seldom does a film successfully balance action, emotion, power, scenery into one cohesive story.
1841;Gladiator is that one blockbuster hit that is larger than life, yet scales back its grandness to let you experience Maximus' story, his rise and fall, personal tragedies, and triumphs.
1842;There should also be pathos and emotion, glimpses into character perspective, and larger themes explored.
1843;Knowing he can manipulate the masses with bloodshed and entertainment, Commodus is able to play this hand well.
1844;At the other spectrum, Gladiator also illustrates the importance of loyalty as a means of living an honorable life, echoed in Maximus' statement: What we do in life, echoes in eternity.
1845;Maximus is sort of microcosm of the past ideals, with successful, powerful but just rulers in charge.
1846;there are many things about this production that are top notch: great casting and performances by its stars, a wonderful music score and scenery, epic gladiator battles, just a larger than life epic atmosphere.
1847;developed, but his just was a little too one dimensional.
1848;still, Gladiator is an awesome viewing experience, one of those films that draws you into its story.
1849;he is boffed up, but still brings the same doggedness and humanity to this roles.
1850;It is good to see him in a role where his character is competent.
1851;if anything, Gladiator is a clever fable against democracy and the masses, who are represented by the throngs of Rome who seek bread and games.
1852;So starts one of the greatest films I have seen, with these scences you are caught up immediately in the tale of a great man.
1853;The battle scenes are incredible with the full might of the supremely trained and confident Roman army unleashing hell as Crowe put it in the film, such terror the barbarians must have felt being crushed under foot by the superior technological ability of the Romans.
1854;Maximus's decline as general in the political battles taking place for Emperorship fling him into slavery and to fight as a gladiator, at every moment Maximus remains human never becoming too much of a hero but staying vulnerable and yet noble and loyal with great strength of character, the sort of man other men would love and follow into battle or anywhere else for that matter.
1855;The death of Maximus at the end allows real tears to be shed for a great man indeed.
1856;An incredible experience, more than a film.
1857;This Movie is really well filmed the costume's and the Scenery looks authentic to the time of the Roman Empire.
1858;The Fighting is Really well Done.
1859;All of this is really impressive, But When you will see this movie you will think imediatly of Brave Heart, without breaking the story to others, similar events in the main characters life happen.
1860;Because of these reasons I give it a 3 Star but it's still a movie you will want to watch.
1861;ray release of this modern historical epic that has become a classic.
1862;up is a Mitsubishi 73 DLP on PC with the best available hardware and software.
1863;It could be that I've become spoiled by modern releases such as The Dark Knight and Transformers 2, both of which look absolutely jaw dropping on a DLP.
1864;This was the first time I've seen the extra scenes.
1865;If you're a big fan of the film, and want to see it on Blu.
1866;The commentary alone is worth the price, trust me.
1867;This is rhe kind of movies you must see more than once.
1868;The more I see it the more I like it.
1869;The music is superbly heartfelt.
1870;this movie must be categorized as the best 21st Century Classic.
1871;Special edition is a plus and the extended edition is a great addtion.
1872;ray to get both the Thearetical and Extended releases and the special feature documentaries.
1873;The opening war scene sounded excellent in the DTS.
1874;The greatness of this film comes from an excellent script coupled with excellent performances from a great cast and other than the principal actors special mention should be made for Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi's roles as well
1875;timers who can still effortlessly steal the show.
1876;One of the best action movies ever made, and to this day, the only movie that can make me shed manly tears.
1877;The plot of Ridley Scott's new epic Gladiator is a mix of the two movies I listed above, along with tigers and many visual treats.
1878;, this film is fantastic.
1879;The battle scenes are extremely well excecuted and thrilling, Crowe makes Mel Gibson look like a whimp, and there's also a good helping of blood too.
1880;Having been brought up in the classics, naturally anything that has to do with ancient Greece or Rome will catch my attention.
1881;this is a work of fiction, and must be approached as such.
1882;charged documentary, I relaxed and had an enjoyable time.
1883;commodus in fact had (as did many emperors before and after) love affairs with relatives, friends, and strangers.
1884;this is a tale of honour and the triumph against great odds of virtue.
1885;russell Crowe does an admirable job as Maximus, the Spaniard general turned slave by betrayal, who finally wins his dignity back in the arena in Rome.
1886;Joaquin Phoenix does an interesting job as Commodus, both weak and manipulative while being determined and ruthless.
1887;the battle sequences that open the film are well done and realistic with regard to tactics and conditions of the Roman fight against the Germanic tribes.
1888;some judicious editing might make this a great film
1889;everyone is aware at this point what an incredible movie this is.
1890;it is a bit like the retribution theme of Ben Hur and the Count of Monte Cristo.
1891;Good in the end prevails over evil.
1892;Not for a long time have we been spectators to an epic film.
1893;Gladiator brought us back into the realm of our past, and I loved it for that.
1894;It brought us back to the tremendous Roman Empire, to the command of a General, fighting for his Ceasar, his Empire, his Rome.
1895;The story is a moving and stunning one, providing a good backbone to the film.
1896;the backbone is supported with an incredible array of images and scenes, (for example the breathtaking flaming arrows flying high over the battle field, in the opening scene) with amazing special effects transporting us back into the world of Rome, the world of an Empire.
1897;its lavish and ornate theatres, games and lives.
1898;As the General, slave, and gladiator, Crowe stands his ground next to some true cinema legends, and I was impressed with his performance.
1899;Joaquin Phoenix also delivers well, and brings our attention back to the whinny, creepish badies, thursty for power and unattained glory.
1900;I will always remember him for this, the crowd will remember.
1901;Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner/Alien) adds a rung to his ladder with this masterpiece of cinema, reaffirming him as one of Britain's best directors.
1902;The documentaries cover all areas of production, and invites you back into the world of Rome through the eyes of a spectator, a spectator in the crowd.
1903;it has such an amazing story, and not to mention an awesome cast!!
1904;russell crowe is such an amazing actor, and i also thought joaquin phoenix was awesome too (even though he played an evil character, he did a good job on doing his part).
1905;the extras are good too.
1906;get the soundtrack, its just as good as the movie!!!!
1907;i also watched Braveheart, also part of the Sapphire Series, which has a beautiful transfer on Blu ray.
1908;he plays this role in such a way, it is truly believeable.
1909;the action parts in this movies are greatly done as well, from the massive battle in the first 15 minutes of the movie, till the final battle against Ceasar.
1910;the final scene of the movie is still my favorite scene ever in a movie.
1911;masterpiece, even after watching it 6 or 7 times.
1912;This is one of the best movies that have been made recently that proves that there is still gold in them Hollywood Hills.
1913;With all of the below average films that have been released in recent years, it is nice to know that some of the movies are still worth watching and are destined to become legendary.
1914;Gladiator is one of those films.
1915;every single moment of the film is pure brilliance and the story really does come to life.
1916;The tale of revenge and jealousy is one that never gets old and that's what makes it work, besides the incredible acting from everyone on here.
1917;Most of us feel happy when the bad guy looses the battle.
1918;But in this case the director cleverly portrays the personality of the bad guy by revealing his articulate thoughts, fears and the dreams of grandeur.
1919;gladiatior is a movie about Maximus a great general played by Russell Crowe.
1920;the new Ceasar has Maximus' family hung and burned along with his plantation.
1921;He is then picked up and becomes a slave that has to fight for a sport and gain the respect of the crowd.
1922;to avenge his family's death he becomes the best Gladiator of them all and being a General for the Roman Empire helps as well!
1923;Back in the late 50's and early 60's Hollywood tended to churn out one major epic per year.
1924;to his credit Ridley Scott has taken the simplest of stories and, aided by modern technology, has produced a thundering good movie in the best tradition of Ben Hur.
1925;it is a long time since moviemakers visited this genre but it has been worth the wait.
1926;At any rate, although the movie is fairly long, you'll be on the edge of your seat for the vast majority of the movie.
1927;Crowe does a great job of looking mean, hurt, and angry whenever he has to.
1928;True, it's a little graphic, but you've got to expect that.
1929;Maximus is then enslaved , and eventually becomes Rome's most popular and undefeated gladiator.
1930;russel Crowe gives a sterling performance as Maximus , and Joaquin Phoenix skilfully plays the evil Commodus.
1931;panoramic historical imagery and rivetting action scenes , together with an involved plot and intrigue make this a historical drama not to be missed.
1932;The acting and visuals are superb and the music rocks!
1933;russel crowe is wonderful, and so is joaquin phoenix.
1934;i definitely recommend this movie to everyone, even if you're not .
1935;a fan of action movies or period pieces.
1936;Gladiator is the best film for 2000.
1937;Expect it garnish a slew of awards next March at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Special Effects, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Cinematography.
1938;It contains some of the best epic fight scenes in cinematic history.
1939;It is a throwback to the classic sword and sandal epics of the 1950's and 60's.
1940;One reviewer described _Gladiator_ as 'one of the best movies ever,' and adds that 'if you liked _Braveheart_, you'll love this movie!'
1941;towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter.
1942;These are just a few of the arresting images to be found within Gladiator, the epic story of Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe), a man whose incorrigible integrity and honesty display themselves at the wrong place and time, namely stepping on the toes of soon.
1943;Some have chided its simple storyline, forgetting that a movie with a simple storyline, if it's well.
1944;acted (Phoenix's Commodus was especially good, just the perfect combination of whiny dependence and power.
1945;mad incestous insanity necessary to create a believable, and quite hateable villain) , well.
1946;directed (by the brilliant Ridley Scott), and well.
1947;school epic of a hero fighting for love, honor, and country.
1948;So if you can overlook the historical inaccuracies, and the relatively simple storyline, be prepared for an unabashedly heroic film done with all the splendor Hollywood can muster.
1949;The three best movie depictions of hand.
1950;Ran is most lyrical, Braveheart most personal, and Gladiator most panoramic.
1951;The pilum (javelin)looked authentic enough.
1952;The helmets and body armor match up pretty well with illustrations from the history books.
1953;as for the story itself, Maximus proved the perfect hero: competent, courageous, and committed.
1954;He had physical strength, skill with weaponry, and was a sagacious commander.
1955;He had the martial courage to face an enemy in mortal combat, the material courage to fight through physical adversity, and the moral courage to say No to a capricious, all powerful Emperor.
1956;He was committed to his family, his moral code, and his country.
1957;The mix of courage and commitment lead him to murderous conflict with the mad Emperor Commodus, resulting in a dramatically satisfying but historically inaccurate denouement.
1958;This is the most entertaining movies.
1959;The best story you could think of and it was successfully put into a movie.
1960;The places they are in look amazing and it feels like it really is acient rome.
1961;Best music in a movie too.
1962;This is one of the best historical epic films I have ever seen from the period costumes to the location and the stunning colesum scene (You can actualy feel that you are inside it) And with the wonderful score that goes so well with the film.
1963;but it is the acting and story that really shine every actor and actress put in a good performance but both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix deserve best actor and supporting actor respectively.
1964;While the story is well written with no cliches or poor dialouge like other films while the ending although sad is also brilliant.
1965;Wonderful film and, what seem to be, excelent extras.
1966;So, let me say, the picture was fine.
1967;Just enjoy one of the best movies ever made!!
1968;I got Braveheart and Gladiator at the same time.
1969;this was a great flick to begin with and the extended version even better(both the theatrical and extended versions are on the Blu Ray).
1970;good extra with the timeline version of the movie production albeit a bit truncated.
1971;there's digital artifacts everywhere, halo.
1972;Come for the action, stay for the story.
1973;That excitement has now been quashed.
1974;This is a great movie.
1975;The scenery was perfect as well the costumes and action was so real.
1976;Maybe I missed it, but this movie was right up there with some of the best ever.
1977;Movie's like this you want to go on and on.
1978;enhanced version, complete with a Paramount mail.
1979;This film made me a Russell Crowe fan.
1980;i had put off watching this film for a long time and when I finally got to see it I was totally blown away by Crowe and the wonderful drama in the film!
1981;Joaquin Phoenix is also to be commended for his absolutely devastating performance as well.
1982;the film draws you in and absolutely draws a ton of emotion from you.
1983;it is just a great movie!
1984;Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of directing this film and the actors were perfect!
1985;Russell Crowe was fully convincing as Maximus and you felt every bit of emotion when you watched his powerful and intense scenes.
1986;***Spoiler***I was especially moved by the scene in which he first sees his wife and son's bodies after he arrives too late to save them.
1987;the arena scenes are especially graphic and may be a turn off to some but I thought they fit well into the context of the film.
1988;The music absolutely complements the film and the look of the film is what is so unique.
1989;It's been returned and Amazon has deemed it appropriate to shrink wrap it and resell it as new.
1990;The majority of the time you can actually see bits of the original packaging still glued to the Blu.
1991;Spectacular action sequences and special effects .
1992;But I hope that those of you in that category can get over it, because Gladiator is a wonderful movie.
1993;It is by far the best movie of the year, possibly even the past few years.
1994;From all angles it is superb, from costume design and musical score to special effects and the sets, and the cinematography as well.
1995;Even lesser characters turn in finely tuned performances.
1996;general who must fight his way to freedom and revenge.
1997;He makes the new emporer a complex, multi.
1998;layered character that is very interesting.
1999;The movie's themes of honor and devotion are portrayed well.
2000;All of the good aspects of this movie far outweigh the violence, so I hope that you are willing to give it a chance.
2001;The movie is great, but even better.
2002;Even after seeing this movie at least five times, it still keeps my attention like I was watching for the first time.
2003;Watch the movie, enjoy and don't take everything to heart.
2004;This is a great movie to watch, and the extra footage helps a lot to develop more character relationships, although the action is pretty much the same (I didn't notice any difference in the action secuencies from the original release).
2005;The extra features are a real jewel, they let you into the world of Ancient Rome and the world of the movie.
2006;It's a great addition to any collection.
2007;The movie, by far the best of the year 2000, is not only an award.
2008;winning production, but it is also one of the few that I personally enjoy watching again and again and again.
2009;The attention to the detail is amazing, especially in the opening scene (the battle in Germanica) and the gladiatorial fights.
2010;Even most deleted scenes are great in the sense that they allow us to understand the characters a little bit more (Commudus' sword smashing of his father's marble bust is a most see), although they neither add nor take of the story.
2011;The casting is superb, with Russell Crow in the main role, Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commudus, along with such legends as Oliver Reed as the freedman slaveholder and Richard Harris as the great Marcus Aurelius.
2012;i'll recomend strongly that anyone who sees this movie shoudl do his/her homework and do a little of reading about Rome, both as a Republic and after, and the huge importance of the entertaining business in her late everyday life (an importance unreached until recent times).
2013;overall, a classic epic of an scope and ambition not seen since 'Ben Hur'
2014;First off, this is a great movie.
2015;The cinematography, majestic sceneries, excellent special effects and emotionally stirring music combine to create a very heartfelt and poetic film.
2016;Its one of those films that can just totally immerse you from start to finish.
2017;Gladiator has been accused of having a conventional storyline, but in my opinion it simply proves that the traditional formula of the hero epic can still make a great movie, as long as it is done the right way.
2018;The actors do a superb job with their characters.
2019;Russell Crowe wins the audience's heart with a very multi.
2020;Maximus has the noble heart and steadfast strength of a true hero, yet his pain and quiet humility prove that he is still human.
2021;Gladiator isn't ground breaking, but it is the best epic adventure film to come out in a long time and it keeps you enthralled and truly stirs your emotions.
2022;There are also a ton of interesting extra features such as behind the scenes looks at the making of the film, production notes, TV spots and a number of deleted scenes.
2023;A great movie and a great value!
2024;It looks and sounds fantastic to me.
2025;Great acting, great direction from Ridley Scott (my favorite director) and very accurate battle scenes (Roman phalanx attacks, use of shields, armor and other equipment.)
2026;make this one a winner in my book.
2027;It just doens't flow right.
2028;I saw this movie in the theater, and loved it.
2029;The second disc has most of the extra features, and a few of the omitted scenes are good.
2030;I think a couple of them shed some more light on the story.
2031;I think this is one of the best movies out there.
2032;The story is a great story, and it is full of emotion.
2033;I highly recommend this movie.
2034;The Disk has the regular version, and the extended version of the film.
2035;The extended adition is way better.
2036;It's way cool like I said in the tital.
2037;The sound is very good.
2038;This is because he tells you about what you'll see if you press play.
2039;Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, Gladiator is an astonishingly engaging epic spectacle with a grand action.
2040;The action is brilliant
2041;The drama is the heart of the movie however, the back.
2042;story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape.
2043;This man is played to perfection by Russell Crowe in one of his most gritty roles to date.
2044;There is also a fantastic supporting cast .
2045;all give life to interesting roles.
2046;This is one of those rare moments when Hollywood makes an attempt at self reflection.
2047;One gets the sense, though, that the film is not just talking about General Maximus but is really a loose allegory for Hollywood's political influence.
2048;From his new position as an entertainer, Maximus is able to carry enough political weight with the people to ultimately defeat the corrupt ruler.
2049;interestingly enough, Gladiator's examination of the relation between entertainment and political power comes near the end of the term of a President who has had more than the normal amount of connections to Hollywood.
2050;One can't help but wonder about the real life connections between politics and entertainment.
2051;Sure the graphic and sound are good.
2052;There's nothing great here about this guy's acting.
2053;See it for what it is: good fighting scenes.
2054;I think that this has to be the definitive movie of the decade.
2055;a great director behind the helm, an oscar.
2056;winning actor, a phenomenal script and a character like non.
2057;ridley Scott has created a vision that is in my own humble opinion, the best look into the such a great era.
2058;He makes us forget the world we live in for awhile and transports us into his world of gladiators and violence.
2059;He has created such a believable character that you wanted to cry .
2060;cheer and feel anger with.
2061;transfer is good almost perfect.
2062;Sound is PERFECT especially the DTS!Extras are also good.
2063;and a GREAT job done.
2064;Sales continue to be high for one very good reason: it is a thrill to watch.
2065;the acting is also above reproach.
2066;Russell crow is a powerhouse in every shot, and Joaquin Phoenix does well as an evil emporer whose faults seem at times motivated by such personal weakness (rather than cold malevolence) that we can almost sympathize with him.
2067;with a second disc of very entertaining extras, Gladiator is a must for anyone who genuinely enjoys movies.
2068;Watch it with the sound turned up.
2069;To actually judge a movie one must actually watch it.
2070;This is what I did, and I feel this movie is completely watchable.
2071;i love this movie .
2072;It's not exactly historically accurate but still a great movie
2073;I think I have seen it over 10 times and still enjoy it.
2074;A real characterisation of a person who longed for a family reunion in Valhalla.
2075;It is a magical piece of work and a good swansong for Oliver Reed.
2076;written, and most of all truly spectacular film, I realy liked it.
2077;There is a lot of action and suspense.
2078;the actors act very well particularly Russell Crowe.
2079;crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks.
2080;His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for.
2081;joaquin Phoenix is convincing and intelligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence.
2082;the old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more.
2083;Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.
2084;so I liked it and I recommended it!
2085;It helps to have a smattering of historical background to fully enjoy the portrayals in this epic.
2086;The attention to detail is very commendable.
2087;The opening battle scenes with the Germanic tribes is laudable and quite realistic.
2088;The portrayal of Commodus is also brilliantly done.
2089;If you don't get yourself bogged down in the historical inaccuracies, you will really enjoy this film.
2090;The acting by all is superb.
2091;Russell Crowe gives one of the best performances ever making this a great epic on the large scale and at the same time an epic for the common man.
2092;Here is an epic motion picture that makes you think and feel, cheer and cry.
2093;This movies really shows purposeful living and usurping your authority over others.
2094;Ridley Scott made it possible.
2095;Despite four previous screen gems that deal with the warrior' s epic such as The Seven Samurais, Ben Hur, Henry V and Braveheart, the superb recreation of the Roman Coliseum, the handle of camera, the splendid cast, the arresting script, the glorious sequence of the initial battle in the forest and the final combat now belong to the history.
2096;a sublime tour de force that was deservedly awarded with the maximum honors.
2097;a new classic of the Cinema .
2098;An excellent choice for people who value great movies.
2099;The Bonus disc has extra scenes that were fantastic.
2100;First off, I just have to say that this is a fabulous movie in every possible way: the screenplay, the acting, the action, and even the soundtrack are all top notch.
2101;This scene actually has historical significance!
2102;Although he wasn't killed this way, he was assassinated by an athlete!
2103;best movie ever but craziest thing ever.
2104;Very well cast, very well acted, cinematography was great.
2105;He did a remarkable job portraying vile and evil.
2106;This was a really entertaining film, though it begins a tad slowly.
2107;All of the acting was fantastic and despite the heavy violence, it wasn't exactly gorey.
2108;This movie combines the Ancient world with a story line that can relate to anyone.
2109;It has drama and action that mix together to tell a compelling story about love, friendship, betrayal, and honor.
2110;Were they as magnificent as I remembered, or was it the spectacle on the big screen?
2111;the performances are towering, and the cast is excellent.
2112;This is a movie most will enjoy, particularly those who enjoyed Braveheart.
2113;I'm not particularly a Ridley Scott fan, but when the performances are great, it's the director.
2114;This is quite an achievement, particularly since it is a genre picture.
2115;There is also an hour long historical supplement that is very educational.
2116;It's easy to see that something needed to be cut due to the sheer length of the movie, but the story is further illuminated by viewing them, and the betting sequence is quite amusing.
2117;it seems like a good time for everyone to find a new hobby than reviewing Gladiator.
2118;Gladiator is visually stunning .
2119;has an excellent and integrated sound track, believable characters, great performances throughout, and the companion disk has a one hour documentary on the life of real Roman gladiators and the history of the games.
2120;the movie is a work of art, and therefore, despite the fact that historical background was used, the plot is fictional.
2121;that a popular gladiator could become a contender for the throne of the Roman Empire .
2122;is ludicrous and reveals a profound ignorance of reality.
2123;All the film takes from this interesting history (much more interesting than the formula melodrama that is Gladiator ) is the fact that Commodus liked attending the gladiatorial games, and the rest is simply swept under the rug.
2124;i enjoyed Gladiator in the theater and despite what annoys me about the movie I actually enjoy every minute of it.
2125;The CGI work stands as a marvel of modern filmmaking.
2126;the musical score is appropriate and really helps to energize the story.
2127;honestly, this is the best movie of all time for me.
2128;russel crowe is simply outstanding in this.
2129;The plot is clever, and Ridley Scott pulled it of astoundingly.
2130;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat almost the entire film.
2131;I bought the British version for 2 reasons.
2132;I loved the cover a whole lot better.
2133;Gladiator won 5 Academy Awards including best picture for the year 2000.
2134;The actual movie is beautifully reproduced both visually and in stunning Dolby Surround Sound.
2135;the few extras you get on the single disc version are:Film commentary from Ridley Scott the award winning directorDeleted Scenes, with director's commentaryTreasure Chest: a unique montage of additional footage cut to the powerful scoreSpecial slide show featuring concept art and storyboardsPhoto Gallery from behind the scenes of the Gladiator setIn.
2136;Be aware it has an R rating for Intense, Graphic combat .
2137;The action sequences are top.
2138;notch and Russell Crowe portrays the quiet strength of a weary veteran quite well.
2139;Russell Crowe gives one of the best performances ever making this a great epic on the large scale and at the same time an epic for the common man.
2140;Here is an epic motion picture that makes you think and feel, cheer and cry.
2141;fight scenes or an intellectual, historical epic on a grand scale.
2142;Ruthless yet loyal soldier is double.
2143;Various members of the hero's family are offed by said dirty politicians (in one of the movie's few powerful and well.
2144;the one plus in this movie is the sublimely understated performance of Russel Crowe, who is able to deliver his corny pseudo.
2145;with a modicum of grace, imbuing the corny script with just a bit of decency.
2146;His performance makes the final mano.
2147;The fight scenes, which showed so much promise in the previews and t. v. spots for the movie, are on the whole just good when viewed in that perspective.
2148;as advertisements, rather than good movie.
2149;Also, some of the CG effects, especially the wide.
2150;scale computer effects so high, that Gladiator has to struggle just to perform a simple chin.
2151;scale special effects (in particular a battle scene involving free.
2152;of reviews generated by this movies indicated that the movie is popular, at least in the commercial sense.
2153;But it actually reminds me of Spartucus played by Kirk Douglas 40 (wow!)
2154;He can fight and win battle after battle.
2155;the movie does convey the good and evil between the two persons vividly, not unlike Ridley Scott's prior movies (Aliens).
2156;in the 60's, a movie like this would be called epic , grand .
2157;Best movie ever, it's about Maximus Veridius, who in the words of Commodus, The general who became a slave, the slave who became the gladiator.
2158;Has a great story line, and wiked sound track by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard.
2159;com that this film is actually based on a true story.
2160;this movie is so good, i have decided to make a computer game about the life of a gladiator.You can learn a lot from this film, with facts about the Romans aswell as important morals.
2161;But you have to see it to know it!!!
2162;I have read articles where it is mentioned that Director Scott first wanted Mel Gibson as Maximus, but Mr. Gibson, feeling his years a bit, replied that he was to old and recommended Crowe as the best person for the job.
2163;Personally, I have anticipated a LOT from this film, because of the director Ridley Scott as well as my favorite film composer Hans Zimmer who is a genius, as well as the cast, including a fine cast: Russel Crowe and Richard Harris and Joquin Phoenis and others.
2164;first of all, this was a very beautiful film.
2165;I bought it because I HAD to listen to this finely composed music as well as Lisa Gerrard's beautiful vocals.
2166;(especially the ending)The cast was very very fine.
2167;Well, all the ingridients for a very very VERY fine epic film are here: Ridley Scott, one of the most influential film director, Hans Zimmer, God of film music, cinematographer who can pull off beautiful images, and a very fine cast, but WHAT WENT WRONG???!!!!
2168;Its grand sense of dignity, honor and passion, from the great Ridley Scott made for great entertainment.
2169;The script by David Franzoni, William Nicholson and John Logan was excellent, using old poetic dialogue to readily convey the proper feelings (By the way, John Logan is writing the script for the next Star Trek movie, so I'm sure it will be great).
2170;Other pluses were the beautiful sets and costumes, the great cinematography and special effects, a grand, moving musical score and the fabulous performances of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Djimon Honsou, Spencer Treat Clark and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, whose brilliant performances highlited this film.
2171;For anyone who likes action, drama, good dialogue, visual splendor and good characterizations, I highly reccomend this film.
2172;but it's cool to have so much stuff about the movie to learn how it was made and produced.
2173;If you thought BraveHeart was good, this puts it to shame, Gladiator is an unspoken film, and its been a real long time since I enjoyed myself in the theater.
2174;Get it and enjoy the rollercoaster.
2175;tightening angle to personalize the savagery, a few mid.
2176;nevertheless, people are eating this film up.
2177;It has some beautiful pictures.
2178;It is my favorite movie of all times!!!
2179;This additional footage is an absolute gain for the overall brilliant story line.
2180;There is also new bonus material on the second and third disc.
2181;All the documentaries provide an interesting insight into the making of the film.
2182;Gladiator is on second position among my all time favorite movies.
2183;Russell Crowe's performance is absolutely brilliant.
2184;Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix are also perfectly chosen for their roles and too give a great performance, just to name a few.
2185;It's a masterpiece of its genre with the most magnificent and brilliant special effects I have ever seen.
2186;There are so many scenes which are pure joy to watch.
2187;The dialog and the score are pure ear.
2188;There is something special in Gladiator, something I have never seen before.
2189;Russell Crowe played his part superbly and the story itself was most absorbing with excellent acting and visual effects
2190;Russel Crowe is an Awesome actor in this masterpiece I recommend this to anyone interested in Ancient or Roman history.
2191;Much has already been said in praise (rightly so), of Ridley's direction, (superb, no one does it better), the effects (unbelievably good looking, in all respects
2192;Russell Crowe as Maximus is terrific, (particularly in the more sensitive aspects of his character, as when he dreams of home and family)
2193;There are some great features on this.
2194;My favorites are the behind.
2195;scenes specials, detailing the special effects, the fight choreography, the architecture, the history of the gladiator games, etc.
2196;There are interviews with many of the creative folks involved, including with most of the actors, and they are all delighted to be doing what they doing, most of them playing around and joking in the interviews.
2197;my favorite part of the bonus material is a written movie journal by the young actor Spencer Clark
2198;He's really quite observant and insightful and made friends with everyone on the set.
2199;His reactions to what was going on around him, the enormity of it all, with the same kind of excitement and fascination that us laymen probably would.
2200;I liked his behind the scene pictures too, including of Crowe and family and mates at a cricket match/barbecue, and teaching Spencer some naughty limericks.
2201;He teased Phoenix about his costume being a dress, and also commented on a scene he filmed with Phoenix and himself where a sword Phoenix as Commodus was leaning on slipped, and Phoenix was professional enough to continue with the scene with a straight face and saved the take.
2202;He was so into the character, so intense, that that little mistake made it into the movie and it seemed right, somehow.
2203;Spencer Clark was very impressed with Joaquin, and so was I (even more so!)
2204;Wow, is all I can add.
2205;watch the movie, enjoy the extras.
2206;This is a good one, a rare one.
2207;The Best MOvie I have even seen.
2208;Has everything you want, action, love, romance!
2209;This is an absolutely terrible transfer.
2210;For months I've anticipated this new, extended version of Gladiator.
2211;I've been thrilled to finally hear the superb DTS tracks on films such as Master and Commander and Lord of the Rings.
2212;This is just one of the good movies I ever seen, the drama and the argument fullfilled the attention of the viewer, the soundtrack music is outstanding, on every scene!
2213;and the visual effects are the best ones, for a movie that bring us such a grandeur time of the romans, We wanted so hot!!!
2214;Awe inspiring grandeur, Saving Private Ryan style cruelty, and a main character with the magnetism of a Clooney or a Newman.
2215;This movie was just beyond incredible.
2216;intense and extrememly well executed.
2217;This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version.
2218;Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world.
2219;Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion.
2220;The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators.
2221;There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public.
2222;And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization.
2223;A great film in this extended version.
2224;Yeah, i finally got remastered version in my hands!!!
2225;Yeah, i finally got remastered version in my hands!!!
2226;Yeah, i finally got remastered version in my hands!!!
2227;Yeah, i finally got remastered version in my hands!!!
2228;Yeah, i finally got remastered version in my hands!!!
2229;The movie has many good parts in it, like in the beginning when there's a big battle.
2230;All the battle and action scenes in the movie are good too, but the opening one is my favorite.
2231;This is all I really liked, though, the action.
2232;This has got to be one of my favorite movies from when I was younger.
2233;Gladiator took home the Oscar for the Best Motion Picture of 2001 and rightfully so.
2234;Gladiator is a great movie with a great plot.
2235;every member of the cast in this film of epic porportions deliever the best performances of their career.
2236;the Special Features Disc includes features that go above and beyond the normal call of duty.
2237;Dairies, trailors, televison spots, and many featurettes.
2238;If you like romance you will find that in Gladiator as well.
2239;This is why Gladiator is the best picture of 2001 and possibly one of the top ten best American films ever.
2240;This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever produced.
2241;There is absolutely no flaws as every detail is perfectly depicted.
2242;This movie's script is the perfect story and as far as the acting goes, Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were brilliant.
2243;Crowe, well deserved his Oscar and Phoenix should have won Best Supporting Actor in my opinion.
2244;It is very interesting to take a glimpse at how Rome was recreated and how other things developed as well.
2245;In all you get an extremely great deal as Gladiator includes the amazing feature presentation followed up by special features on a second disc.
2246;Easily one of my top 5 favorite films of all time and undoubtedly Russel Crowe's greatest to date.
2247;emperor and restore the dream that once was the United States of America?
2248;Gladiator is everything that a modern epic film should be.
2249;This film is a towering triumph that will not soon be forgotten.
2250;written script, amazing visuals, incredible moments of both action and drama, as well as absolutely stellar acting performances from the entire cast.
2251;Russell Crowe established himself as one of the best actors in the world today, with his commanding and emotionally powerful portrayal of Maximus, who is a hero in every sense of the term.
2252;Crowe deserves every accolade that he gets for his marvelous performance, which was by far one of the most commanding and heartfelt performances I have ever seen in a movie.
2253;Crowe, an avid horseback rider, even did many of his own stunts in the movie.
2254;Joaquin Phoenix delivers a breakthrough performance as Commodus, the emotionally conflicted son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by veteran actor Richard Harris.
2255;Phoenix's performance demands sympathy as well as hatred from the viewer, with gripping emotions as well as an ever.
2256;present sense of jealousy and spite.
2257;The late, great Oliver Reed(who died shortly before filming wrapped), put the finishing touch on a storied career with his performance as Proximo, the slave ower who helps Maximus regain his freedom.
2258;Connie Nielsen, a relative newcomer, also delivers an excellent performance as Commodus' older and wiser sister, who has had previous involvement with Maximus.
2259;The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning, as ancient Rome is brought to life like never before with some absolutely amazing computer.
2260;generated visuals, as well as painstakingly crafted sets.
2261;This movie is grand in both story and scale, and visuals serve to reinforce the strong acting by providing an unbelievable backdrop for the story.
2262;Ridley Scott, who is a master of skillful character filming, does not disappoint in what many people consider his finest film to date, as his skillful camera work gives a deep insight into the emotions of every character in the film.
2263;Gladiator is truly an epic achievement.
2264;The inclusion of a journal by young actor Spencer Treat Williams, (who plays Lucius, the eventual heir to the throne of Rome)is n especially welcome addition.
2265;The Bottom Line is this: Gladiator is a true modern epic, one of the best films ever made.
2266;It features incredible acting, a gripping storyline, and absolutlely stunning visuals.
2267;This movie is a must.
2268;Give it as a gift to anyone who has a home theater
2269;This is a guy's movie
2270;I thought this movie was solid.
2271;From the cinematography, art direction, writing,story, acting, directing, production, evan costume .
2272;all I thought hit their mark.
2273;This movie is a good example of when you have a good story and it is well written it can lift everything else.
2274;I imagine that during the production of this movie the people involved knew they had something.
2275;The acting was strong for all of the major characters.
2276;I am happy that a blockbuster action hero type was not cast as the gladiator and they went with Russel Crowe.
2277;was a memorable scene along with others.
2278;It is always the emotional component that shines through.
2279;a close friend of mine is an atheist.
2280;He confided in me that the ending of this film always makes him weep.
2281;this movie is so amazing I was left breathless by the end of it.
2282;But gladiator on the other hand is a historical epic to top all historical epics.
2283;The acting is as fine in this movie than in any movie ever brought to the silver screen.
2284;The story is absolutely facinating.
2285;Russel Crow is the most uniqivically the best actor of alltime.
2286;Five stars, five stars, five stars.
2287;rated a movie as was released this year.
2288;but, yes, the gladiatorial scenes are a sight to behold.
2289;No doubt about it, Scott is a visual master and the combat scenes are intense and rousing.
2290;if you are looking for some great action scenes and rousing conflict on the field of battle, this is a place to look.
2291;thanks for your time people.
2292;This is a real classic.
2293;The music is perfect and really adds to each scene.
2294;The audio tracks sounds great and enhances the action.
2295;Basically, this is an action movie, with lots of spectacle and the plot is mostly an excuse to move to the next battle.
2296;As spectacle and action, it's fabulous.
2297;Saying this movie is good would underate it, saying it is awesome would underrate too, never since 'The Matrix' or 'Star Wars Episode 1' has a movie got me so involved with it, wanting more and more and getting what I want out of it.
2298;He should have won the Academy Award for his performance, but he did not.
2299;The scenes with the tiger was an eye.
2300;This might be biased, since Gladiator is my favorite movie of all time.
2301;The script, acting, and music work so well together, it sends the viewer along for an emotional roller coaster.
2302;The battle scenes are amazing, a bit on the gory side, but is expected considering the subject matter.
2303;The special effects, concerning the recreation of ancient Rome in all of it's glory, are striking.
2304;I found the extras worth watching.
2305;Russell Crowe points out a few bloopers that are still in the movie, which I found interesting.
2306;If you watch the extras, you will be surprised by how hard it was to film the Proximo character, since Oliver Reed had passed away before filming was finished.
2307;5 out of 5 and thumbs up to be sure!
2308;After seeing the other summer blockbusters , I was completly surprised by Gladiator.
2309;It combined a classic story (part vengance, part action) and incredible sets into an truely epic experience.
2310;In addition the acting is superb and the special effects seamless.
2311;My husband and I both loved it.
2312;The behind the scenes footage and commentary from Ridley Scott and Hans Zimmer etc are excellent.
2313;I appreciate the extra additions and enjoy the movie more because of the added features.
2314;If I were a voting member of the academy Gladiator would get my best picture Oscar and Russell Crowe would also win for best actor.
2315;This film is compelling and well acted and it has enough violence to keep you interested if you are not into great performance and writing.
2316;This is a great film.
2317;There is a great deal of extra material and it even comes with a second disc to hold some of it.
2318;Gladiator was a wonderful movie.
2319;If you love the old classic EPIC movies you'll love this.
2320;From the begging to the end the movie keeps you glued to the screen with masive battles, poetic dialog, and romance.
2321;Not to mention the special effects are amazing, you really get a since of rome's true grandur.
2322;This is a much see movie with a great story line, acting and affects.
2323;One of Russell Crowe's best movies.
2324;An deep and graphic depiction of the time of the Roman Empire.
2325;Russell Crowe's acting both holds and lifts the movie up to be one of a kind.
2326;i love this movie more than love itself.
2327;it is one of the most amazing movies ever made period.
2328;He instantly turns deadly serious and faces battle with courage, and even a touch of humor as a smile crosses his face when he almost takes out one of his own men.
2329;The battle scenes are gritty, but still manage to convey a sense of heroism.
2330;Hans Zimmer's score is wonderfully appropriate (how did it not win Best Score?)
2331;This film will amaze you if you haven't seen it yet, and will continue to if you already have!
2332;Gladiator is an amazing film on many levels: it is a broad, expansive, epic movie that has not been attempted in many years in Hollywood.
2333;that has an amazing center in the character of Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls victim to the ambition of the illegitimate Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).
2334;On the other hand, it can be very personal and intimate at times.
2335;This is a film that is absolutely riveting from beginning to end
2336;wrenching emotion from Lisa Gerrard's voice harkens back to Titanic.
2337;Until I saw this film, I was beginning to seriously doubt the ability of Hollywood to produce engaging, powerful, epic films.
2338;in part, the film is a tremendous success because it conveys the notion of what it means to be a good person.
2339;this film is a must see!
2340;It is a classic already.
2341;Everything about it was so good.
2342;the acting, the plot, the fight scenes, and the scenery.
2343;it was a winner in my mind!
2344;I loved the scene where Maximus fights off the lions cus it gave me an idea about what you need to do in order to survive and avenge the deaths of your loved ones.
2345;this movie explores the Roman Times and tells us it wasn't easy.
2346;Gladiator is one of the best big movies of all.
2347;First, the film opens with a fascinating battle scene that gets your heart pumping and eyes open.
2348;Finally, the film takes the viewer on a roller coaster of plot twists and turns with great action to go along.
2349;Gladiator was one great epic, but I didnt think it deserved the Oscar.
2350;Because I thought Traffic was a much more important and much more interesting.
2351;The film really takes you by suprise, especialy the Oscar calibar performance of Russell Crowe.
2352;(Which still didnt measure up to Don Cheadle's or Michael Douglas' performances in Traffic).
2353;the film tells the story of how a King, (or was suppose to be a King), went from being a King to being a Slave, and then turning into a Gladiator!The story really strikes a cord as the special effects are really some of the best of recent memories.
2354;neccesary, and totaly uncalled for.
2355;But that aside the film really did good in the box.
2356;if you're really into the knights and kings and things of that nature, you're in for a treat.
2357;There's also some good modeling as far as values in life.
2358;I honestly did not expect Russell Crowe to be a convincing lead, but he pulls it off in great fashion.
2359;Definately worth the money to pick this one up!
2360;A well balanced blend of drama and action, Gladiator follows the rise and fall of two great men.
2361;Maximus (Russel Crowe) delivers a mind imprinting performance as he goes from General of the Northern armies to becoming a slave.
2362;With many road bumps along the way, we see a man fight for love, honor, and respect.
2363;Amazing sequences, artistically sound in it's delivery, and some kick butt gladiator fighting that'll have you screaming thumbs down to the new Ceasar.
2364;simply the greatest music composer i have ever heard.
2365;russel Crowe a deserving oscar winner.
2366;the right choice for the movie.
2367;and Joaquin Phoenix is a plus to the movie.
2368;the movie is written well goes well to the right to the end and what makes it better is Hans Zimmer music.
2369;matches soo well wid the movie and the scenes.
2370;tracks like The Battle,Honor Him and Now We Are Free are soo good.
2371;the movie is soooo well written.
2372;This is one of the best film's that I've seen in quite some time.
2373;The breathtaking sequences and graphic effects really put me in this time period.
2374;I also like the special features such as the hour.
2375;The movie itself is an absolute classic.
2376;At the beginning of the movie where we see Maximus as a General leading a final battle, you see an amazing wide shot of flying, flaming, arrows.
2377;It should look amazing, right?
2378;love this movie one of my all time favorites great acting and great storyline excellent director has all extended scenes
2379;Russell Crowe is powerful and convincing in his role as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful as the sniveling coward Commodus, but the talents of these men are nearly overshadowed by the film's incredible length.
2380;many of the scenes involve, of course, the gladiator contests, and it is in these that we see Maximus' power as both a survivor and superior fighter.
2381;I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.
2382;the film is certainly worth seeing at least once for all of the special effects and Russell Crowe's amazing acting skills!
2383;The action sequences are top.
2384;The best fighting sequence is the first in the Roman Coliseum where Crowe and his horde of slaves turn the tables on their opponents.
2385;The adrenaline rush is great in Gladiator and eventhough I hate to admit it, Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as Maximus.
2386;The film is long (over 2 hrs) but it flies by (the sure sign of a great movie) and it leaves you wanting more.
2387;This is one of the only commercial films that I can truly say deserved the Oscar for best picture.
2388;esque script that will have you interested for the most part.
2389;But the real cool thing about this movie is the action.
2390;It's expertly directed (thanks to Ridley Scott) and is everything that action should be: action.
2391;Have a sense of humor!)
2392;winning sound and visual effects are done justice in a big way.
2393;Colors are deep and well.
2394;Blood spews across the screen and creates a very convincing experience.
2395;Watch this film on the biggest, widest TV you can find.
2396;Surrounds used all the time (even in quiet scenes) and the ambient effects are exceptional.
2397;The bottom end is extremely powerful and will give your subwoofer a good run.
2398;Damn, this is a good mix.
2399;Gladiator is a marvelous movie.
2400;It gives you a sense of what it may have been like during these Roman times.
2401;The story is, of course, fiction.
2402;Maximus, quite possibly the greatest character created for the big screen, was made up and history was re.
2403;That aside, this movie is a must for people of all ages to watch and enjoy.
2404;You'll be looking up these characters in books and online after watching the actors give such great performances as them.
2405;It may've peaked my interest more in History:)
2406;first, the film is reasonably compelling and is certainly well.
2407;But I suspect most of us have seen the film.
2408;Thus, what exactly is offered in addition to that?There is a grand making.
2409;there is also an incredibly interesting (perhaps since I'm a former music major) documentary on the composer, how he goes about creating films scores and the Gladiator score in particular, how the concepts of the film influence what he wants his music to communicate and how he managed to recruit a couple of hard.
2410;about the real Roman gladiators, production notes (a very interesting read.
2411;it all started with a painting!)
2412;, etc. not only is this a fun (not great
2413;this would be a great movie to watch with friends, maybe have that costume party you were thinking about.
2414;it is not a movie for children because of the violence, but is Russell Crowe's best role.
2415;This movie is so freakin good, even after the fifth time watching it.
2416;Even the soundtrack is breathtaking.
2417;This movie has it all!
2418;I also loved all the special features!!!
2419;Gladiator is always a good watch, because although it's about a warrior it still allows the plot to come through.
2420;This is what an Oscar Winner should be, not what's presented in the political world of Hollywood.
2421;This is one of the best movies for the type.
2422;It stands with Brave Heart in detail and realism.
2423;The story is an old one but enjoyable all the same.
2424;The additional materials are excellent.
2425;Sit back, relax, turn off your mind and enjoy!
2426;a devoted and hugely successful Roman general slated to succeed the aging Emperor, is outfoxed by the Emperor's son, enslaved and returns to Rome as a gladiator to exact revenge.
2427;I found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, with incredible fight scenes including tigers, and an awesome recreation of ancient Rome.
2428;The armor and weaponry are terrific as well, being appropriately intimidating and sticking to period themes.
2429;the star attraction, of course, was the Roman Coliseum and the games that were held within.
2430;As stated earlier, the computer images were utterly realistic, making the place seem perfectly real.
2431;The filmmakers also had the wit to allow a bit of emotional depth to the characters .
2432;for instance, allowing newcomers the time to marvel at the wonder of Roman architecture.
2433;Though the historical Commodus seems to have enjoyed dressing as a gladiator and had a too.
2434;like writing a film in which George Washington builds the Panama Canal.
2435;shortcomings aside, the film is riveting and fun.
2436;Crowe gives a splendid performance as the fearlesssoldier, merciful and uncorrupted and yet unfailingly worldly.
2437;despite the violence, which Crowe's character displays, his love forhis family, his humour in the face of death and his profoundphilosophy is truly memorable.
2438;In addition, the musical score for this filmpossesses a certain irony as it swells into epic song in the mostgruesome parts.
2439;Best of all is the ending.
2440;Although it was fairlyobvious that Maximus would fulfill the former emperor's legacy, theway the film turned out was a pleasant surprise.
2441;Russell Crowe's magnetic performance anchors the spectacular action.
2442;gladiator is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.
2443;By the time I'd watched it three or four times, I started to notice how well.
2444;crafted everything is: the cinematography, the art direction, and most especially the musical score.
2445;But the first two times, it was a pure emotional experience.
2446;Ridley Scott has given us a lot of great movies, like Blade Runner and Alien, but Gladiator is probably his biggest mainstream hit and for good reason.
2447;The story of Maximus is a human, entertaining one, the depiction of Rome is the best we've yet seen (thanks to some digital imagery)and as a result, as viewers we really do feel transported to that time and place.
2448;This Movie Is truly a work of art.
2449;spellbounding background and special effects.
2450;I watch ALLLLOOOTTT of movies and this is one of those that WILL meet all the expectations and the 'hype' that it gets
2451;Great story from begging to end and the soundtrack is beautifully orchrestrated by Hans Zimmer.
2452;IF you liked BraveHeart or the Patriot you will enjoy Gladiator.
2453;i found it be very entertaining, and have watched it several times.
2454;Me and amazon had a good relationship for a while.
2455;A power house thriller right to the very end it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, very good acting Russel Crowe (maximus) is the perfect person to play the gladiator just because he he has that get the hell away from me look about him he should at least get best actor noninations he may not win it but he is worthy of it.
2456;this movie is in my opinion for best picture now I say this after seeing the patriot I have decided that Gladiator is my new choice for best picture.
2457;Thank god Ridley Scott has made an incredible movie that is not just something to fill that aching void.
2458;This movie is as epic and glorious as they come.
2459;This sets the tone as Russell so skillfully plays a Military Hero who desperately wants to go home to his farm and spend the rest of his days with his family.
2460;In true Roman loyalty though, he is asked by the Ceaser to take his place, played very well by Richard Harris, who could easily leave this as his final role.
2461;crowe plays his charater so well in placing Maximus' desires so close to reality.
2462;With that comes much political intrigue as well as bloody violence as the games get started.
2463;Nonetheless, everyone plays their roles so skillfully and the direction is still incredible.
2464;Ridley Scott hasn't had a project this juicey in years and he seemed to master every detail.
2465;The recreation of Rome is awesome, especially the Colliseum.
2466;A feat attributed to the incredible advancement of computer graphics.
2467;Gladiator succeeds on so many levels that it was no wonder Scott was granted the job of bringing Hannibal Lecture back to the big screen.
2468;This timeless director of such great movies like Alien and Blade Runner seems to have found new motivation.
2469;The power, courage, and drama of this film is simply outstanding.
2470;Pure, thrilling entertainment on an incredible scale.
2471;It's rare that I see a movie so full of such awesome talent.
2472;connie Nielsen as Lucilla is breathtaking.
2473;She posesses maximum amounts of intelligence, grace, and beauty.
2474;Another standout in a great cast is Oliver Reed.
2475;Damn, he was a good actor.
2476;And the rise, and cheer, as if, as if you're the Thunder God himself.
2477;The acting, story, and sets in this movie are all astounding.
2478;I'm still quite surprised at the praise heaped onto Gladiator .
2479;even film critics I admire seem to believe that it represents the second coming of epic filmmaking.
2480;I'm absolutely amazed that everyone I know worships this film.
2481;but to me, beneath Russell Crowe's charisma, the mock historical lesson, and the earsplitting battle scenes, there is absolutely nothing of consequence.
2482;Be aware of the release date of this item in respect to the reviews.
2483;I must admit that I really liked this movie the first time I saw it on the big screen.
2484;I liked it so much that I saw it again.
2485;the opening battle scene is impressive and exciting along with the excellent score.
2486;Every word that Maximus says is sooo politically correct and he's so gooder than good.
2487;The scenes involving the two senators talking about the games and any conversation between Commodus and Lucilla are perfect examples.
2488;They're impressive in the fakest sense.
2489;Spartacus is complex and straightforward at the same time.
2490;There were good good guys, mean good guys, so.
2491;The end scene between Olivier and Simmons is worth the price alone .
2492;beautiful acting and moving drama.
2493;This story is set in ancient Rome around 180 A. d. Marcus Aurelius is the aging emperor and Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a great general who has won many battles.
2494;Maximus and his pack of gladiators become well known and come to Rome to fight in the Coliseum.
2495;They defy incredible odds and utterly destroy a horde of gladiators in chariots.
2496;Maximus becomes the crowd's favorite.
2497;The scenes in the arena with the gladiators are quite grisly but are some of the best scenes in the movie.
2498;He lusts after his sister and has spies to keep him well informed.
2499;ray at a reasonable price and ordering was also another pleasing experience.
2500;Director Ripley Scott has a classic on his hands and he knows it.
2501;Ridley Scott's masterful work behind the camera is evident from the opening scene, eerily foreshadowing the rest of the movie.
2502;An amazing movie with awesome cinematography and incredible battle scenes.
2503;Russel Crowe does a magnificent job, as does Joaquin Phoenix(brother of River)in the role of Commodus.
2504;Now that we are on the subject of Commodus, this movie is somewhat historically accurate, seeing as Commodus actually fought in gladiatorial battles claiming over one thousand victories in his lifetime, and was planning on moving into the gladiatorial barracks prior to his assassination at the hands of his family, though not Lucilla.
2505;The movie first off is a classic.
2506;This movie is great if your looking for some action and a great story.
2507;well I have it now, and have probably watched it 15+ times.
2508;The acting is very good for an epic.
2509;action movie, and the special effects of Rome are surrealistic.
2510;his contribution to the movie surpassed any of the other actors/actresses in my opinion.
2511;i would recommend this movie to anyone, and if you have a good surround system it's all the better, the musical score blends very well with the action, and the drama.
2512;The cinematography has been very well done, especially the scene where Commodus is riding into Rome for the first time to the Senate building.
2513;the use of a slightly blue filter adds to the effect so well.
2514;hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.
2515;A very educational movie with stunning effects and a great script allow this movie to be one of the best of the year.
2516;Try watching it with you children (teens and above) so that they can learn about the Roman Empire.
2517;Stunning production values, a stirring score by Hans Zimmer, and exemplary performances by Russell Crowe and the always terrific Joaquin Phoenix make this film .
2518;one of 2000's biggest blockbusters .
2519;The opening battle scene alone is worth the price of admission.
2520;This movie has a shallow plot, which isnt a bad thing, great acting, which is a good thing, increadible fight scenes, which is a good thing, emotional characters, good thing, and an ending that people SHOULD have expected from an epic.
2521;Russell Crowe as Maximus is a great pick(i like him better than gibson in braveheart), and Commodus was played brilliantly by Phoenix.
2522;If you like action packed movies with feeling in the characters, this one is for you
2523;As everyone notes, this an epic tale second to none, and will make you a fan of Russell Crowe.
2524;The mix is exceptional and one of the best on the market.
2525;i highly recommend the 2 disc set with the DTS 5.1 ES .
2526;no processing is fine
2527;There has been so much mentioned of the fine acting, the beautiful cinematography and the emotional impact this film can have that I won't bother mentioning it except to say I agree.
2528;some other things I think are noteworthy are the director's choices and style.
2529;ridley Scott is one of the few directors besides George Lucas who understands the visual medium of film.
2530;It's just as much fun seeing what's happening in the background as the foreground.
2531;The colors, lighting and compositions make this much like viewing a succession of paintings.
2532;And like Lucas he understands and keeps the special effects to a respectable story.
2533;top effects in The Matrix) they become in the hands of lesser directors .
2534;this film also taps into several of the themes raised and explored in the director's earlier masterpiece, Bladerunner (see it if you haven't).
2535;This film showed it as the logical conclusion to life.
2536;We all face the same fate, it's how you live your life that matters.
2537;You can be the hero, a thinker, honest, not asking for more than you need, making your family your priority, a good and just individual standing up for your beliefs and values.
2538;this film appeals to both the regular Hollywood movie watcher, filled with action, heroics, exotic places and sights, and also to those who search look to find a greater meaning for life in the films they watch.
2539;Thankfully we have a handful of directors like Ridley Scott who ignore those categories and make films that ultimately can have a broader and timeless appeal.
2540;it was a tried and true formula long before he got to it.
2541;What is worth the sacrifice of death.
2542;The movie does this not just with dialogue, but with imagery, music, and mood.
2543;They knew, as Proximo did, that they had to entertain to get it across to a wide audience.
2544;did they succeed in blending high themes with blockbuster entertainment?
2545;one's own as well as that of others.
2546;I really love the movie, and I did not have an issue with receiving this product.
2547;I think that this is a wonderful movie.
2548;It is the BEST movie ever made.
2549;It is full of adrenalin pumping action, heart grasping drama, bold emotions, and maginficent picture.
2550;Ancient Rome has never looked so good on a screen before.
2551;Every actor and actress in this movie is AMAZING!
2552;The action, the storyline and the extraordinary acting performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make this movie a must have.
2553;I absolutely love seeing my one of my old favorites Oliver Reed in this .
2554;see if you can tell which.
2555;Good cast, good production values, Creepy bad guy in Phoenix .
2556;The idea of our gladiator returning to his family and the shots of the fields and their idea of the afterlife and the shot on his moving body after death are classic .
2557;that this is primary source, and this is an OLD movie by their standards .
2558;helps them to see things in a new light.
2559;Gladiator has been called unworthy of the best picture Oscar is got by many critics.
2560;At one time I thought it was great but not Best Picture worthy as well.
2561;The cast is strong especially Russel Crowe in the lead, the direction is excellent, the story is well told and the battle scenes are fantastic.
2562;hur were made impressively without such technology being available at the time.
2563;the movie is still one of the most entertaining movies you'll see and it's a shame that Roger Ebert sat down and picked it apart because there's nothing that makes it bad.
2564;accurate to the time period.
2565;The supporting work by Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, the late great Oliver Reed and late great Richard Harris are all fine as well.
2566;My point is that despite minor flaws Gladiator is still a very good movie and deserved that Best Picture award!
2567;Everybody has already mentioned the dazzling visuals, so I need not go on further.
2568;Great action, great fight scenes.
2569;Gladiator is an exciting and fascinating movie from beginning to end.
2570;If you enjoy big budget classics in the tradition of Ben.
2571;This epic film starring Russell Crowe is a powerful and emotional experience.
2572;Not only is the film interesting, it is also beautiful.
2573;This movie was bold and delightful and the action was intense and manly.
2574;I found this to be true but inbetween that I fell in love with the consistent imagery most certainly brought together by the visual nature and general dark and dusty color of most of the filming and most certainly the amazing scoring of the film.
2575;The soundtrack like in most masterpieces completes this film giving it the added reoccuring nature of the plot.
2576;It was inspiring and certainly led me to believe that this movie would not have been the same without Zimmer on the project.
2577;He was masterful and certainly many scenes became epic with his help.
2578;I believe the calming nature of the vocals and background music blended into the time and certainly gave the aspect of reality of music to the film.
2579;I need this soundtrack as I feel it can take me back to the imagery of the movie and certainly can intrigue many minds.
2580;However don't just watch it but listen to it and I feel you to will fall in love with its grand nature.
2581;I will forever remember the grain fields as a place I would be calm and serene in.
2582;All the My God, he's gorgeous!
2583;aside, this film is wonderful.
2584;The title character is one you root for from the beginning and the supporting characters you either love to love or love to hate.
2585;Beautifully filmed and expertly directed, there are no slow spots in this one!
2586;type filled with honor and truthfulness, which led to his problems.
2587;The villain is very well realized to a point that I wished that the protag.
2588;Every character had his/her strength.
2589;The fights were very enjoyable (pardon me for using the term enjoyable for people being slaughtered) and believable.
2590;The sound is magnificent on a 5.1 system.
2591;I was so impressed with this movie.
2592;Visually a masterpiece of art.
2593;The music, the acting,the scenery,and the action is a sight to behold.
2594;the return of the bigger.
2595;And thanks to the excellent direction and vision of Ridley Scott and an amazing cast, the film is able to out.
2596;pounding action sequences, a storyline that reels you in and holds you by the throat, and a stunningly beautiful score.
2597;go see it in the theatre, if you haven't already.
2598;Nothing beats watching this grand picture on the big screen.
2599;This is a must see movie.
2600;This movie has its fair share but has an amazing story line to it.
2601;I will not give it away but I will say that this is one of those underdog stories.
2602;Every time I watch this movie I feel motivated to do better.
2603;And of course there is great music to accompany this amazing film.
2604;This is a must see!
2605;But surprise, surprise, the story was engrossing enuff that she got caught up in it and really liked it.
2606;It also exceeded my expectations .
2607;On the technical side, if you have a decent home theater set up, the DTS soundtrack on this is truely awesome and worth the price of admission.
2608;The movie is good even though I don' like blood shed and I could have done without killing Joaquin and Russell.
2609;For more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the AVS Forum and the review at The Digital Bits .
2610;I was completely satisfied with this transaction.
2611;No complaints here, extraordinary service.
2612;Everything about this movie harkens to the classic epics of Hollywood.
2613;Don't mistake admiration for theft though, this movie is pure 21st century and very original.
2614;through the lavish use of computer graphics, as well as masterful costume work, the viewer is vaulted back to ancient Rome.
2615;Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix both offer Oscar caliber performances, and the supporting cast is likewise excellent (of particular note is Djimon Hounsu of Amistad ).
2616;The film is packed with action, but also relates a tale of political intrigue, and also deftly deals with issues of love and faith.
2617;Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding
2618;I particularly enjoyed the TLC documentary on gladiatorial games, which does much to ground the movie in some historical fact.
2619;I also enjoyed the deleted scenes with commentary from the director.
2620;I enjoyed them all for what they added to the film, but I really liked the insight into the editing process that Scott's comments provided.
2621;I thought Gladiator was very good.
2622;I think that it was very good and Russel Crowe was a very good actor in it.
2623;the script was great the acting was great it was a great movie Russel crowe was unbeliveable
2624;liked it as much as braveheart
2625;loved every aspect of the film.
2626;His performance as a Roman general.
2627;slave carries this movie over top and makes its script flaws forgiveable.
2628;crowe begins the film as heroic and victorious Maximus, Emperor Marcus Aurelius' favorite.
2629;many aptly compared it to Saving Private Ryan.
2630;It trumps Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus finale for terror and realism, if not for scale and spectacle.
2631;in between are some amazing scenes of gladiatorial combat, where dust and blood mingle.
2632;This is Russell Crowe at his finest, in a brutal action sequence with emotional content, where his character's pain and loss coalesce with the crowd's bloodlust to produce a dramatic and utterly believable gesture of contempt.
2633;this is a rousing, gut.
2634;wrenching spectacle with a human center and plenty of emotion.
2635;Not only that, its recreation of the Colosseum is awe.
2636;This is one of those movies for which this technology was created.
2637;mentor, an excellently restrained Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius (great emperor, so.
2638;office smash and was certainly one of the biggest films of the summer.
2639;I remember how thrilled I was while viewing it at the cinema.
2640;Russell Crowe stars as the general Maximus in this exciting epic.
2641;Joaquin Phoenix delivers a superb performance as the evil emperor Commodus.
2642;Connie Nielson, Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris all deliver fine performances too in supporting roles.
2643;This film is a grand epic, featuring wonderful and exciting fight sequences, beautiful sets and locations and of course great direction.
2644;many comparisons have made to Braveheart, and well they don't seem entirely just, I love Braveheart and coincidentally it also won 5 Academy Awards, but I feel they are both excellent films and two stand.
2645;THey are certainly two of the best epics that have come out in the last 10 years.
2646;While I did enjoy Troy, and thought it was a tremendously entertaining film, I feel that Gladiator was a more substantial film with a better script and better acting.
2647;In terms of action, well that's hard to say.
2648;Both deliver excellent action sequences, but Troy's action sequences are bigger, considering some of the action sequences are major battles.
2649;overall this film is a beautiful movie, with an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and is certainly much better than Troy's soundtrack by James Horner, though that isn't a terrible soundtrack.
2650;the most historically accurate movie about Rome or .
2651;I loved the story, and the action scenes.
2652;I loved the entertainment value of it being a movie, not a documentary.
2653;Hans Zimmer's best musical score.
2654;Everything about this film is magical.
2655;I am proud to have witnessed this masterpiece.
2656;Gladiator is a remarkable film.
2657;It lavishly recreates the glory and decadence of the Roman Empire.
2658;the action scenes in Gladiator are outstanding.
2659;The performances were Oscar caliber.
2660;Russell Crowe has the best screen presence of any actor I've seen.
2661;His academy award was well deserved.
2662;Joaquin Phoenix was riveting as the scheming Commodus.
2663;Phoenix was one of the best screen villians I have seen in a long time.
2664;many people complain that Gladiator is nothing more than well choreographed action sequences.
2665;Gladiator is a story of two men, Maximus and Commodus, vying for the love and respect of their fellow citizens.
2666;But hey, what do they know!
2667;I thoroughly HATED this movie.
2668;rated actor in the last 20 years.
2669;He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining.
2670;panel cartoons, sportswriting allegories, and pedophile come.
2671;So it's a bit of a surprise that most of the combat scenes in this film play pretty well.
2672;but most of it is beautiful, in an uncanny way.
2673;The great battle scene at the start of the film is like a pre.
2674;The man is magical: whenever he appears onscreen, suspension of disbelief collapses.
2675;It is a great fantasy with exciting action, a good story, impressive visuals, solid acting, a well written script and a good ending.
2676;it certainly takes you back to the days of Hollywood's glory.
2677;Gladiator is a true epic and a great movie.
2678;What can I say, another powerhouse performance from Russell Crowe, with Riddley Scott putting together a great story and directing, it doesn't get much better than this.
2679;looked and read ALL the special features of the movie is that the cast and crew are extremely fortunate.
2680;He really is a smart one, i wish i could of gotten in to acting, if he is reading these you are lucky and stick with it.
2681;and the Zulu rush forward saying something like, Yah!
2682;Excellent technical production, very good acting, corny script, and criminal intent by our commissars of popular culture.
2683;And most importantly the film lacked intensity.
2684;on the positive side Phoenix's performance was so credible that I actually believed that he was living during that time period.
2685;Also the cinematography was spectacular but forget about all that the story was just not particularly engaging.
2686;When one starts to forget what room they are in and starts thinking about what they would do in such and such a situation, or they find themselves praying for the characters (only very quickly smacking themself in the mind to snap out of it), then one knows she has a movie worth the cost.
2687;You knew it by heart.
2688;And that point is all the more why I recommend heartily with five stars .
2689;just get it and see!
2690;Lots of action and great special effect!
2691;Gladiator is truly a spectacular movie.
2692;Think that the greatest aspect of it was how real it was.
2693;The movie itself really drew you into it, making you feel like you were there.
2694;The troubles the main characters faced really make you sympathize, and therefore make you care about the outcome.
2695;I think something that contributes to this was great acting
2696;It's a very impressive film that you will 'really get into'.
2697;An anction packed movie with a great storyline sums this movie up entirely.
2698;Each character is played and cast extremely well, totally belieavable, I especially liked seeing thorgalson as Tigris, extreemely well done.
2699;A brilliant movie I have watched many many times, and one i'm sure I will continue to watch for many years to come.
2700;The opening battle alone is worth seeing this movie, much like Spielberg's Private Ryan.
2701;But then the attention to authenticity of the entire film is worthy of Akira Kurosawa and the story seems the work of a well.
2702;I'm a history teacher who has the pleasure of teaching about this time period.
2703;The way that the gladiators trained and fought was really true to life.
2704;I was hesitant to see this at the movies, because I thought it would be some cheezy depiction of over.
2705;A classic, introduced my son to it for the first time, he loved it to.
2706;Gladiator will always be an excellent movie due to the terrific performances and stunning locations.
2707;Ridley Scott did a great job in getting this movie to where it is now in motion picture history, and sadly missed out on a Best Director Oscar, which was an injustice in my opinion.
2708;Disc 2 has a great documentary about the making of the film that's pretty substantial, covering aevery aspect of production.
2709;The segment about the resurrection of Oliver Reed is especially interesting.
2710;The special effects team had to re.
2711;I'd say they did a pretty good job.
2712;This was one film that I really enjoyed from start to finish.
2713;I really like the story of revenge against the Emperor.
2714;Russel Crowe does such a superb job that I was quite happy when he won the Oscar for Best Actor.
2715;I really thought Ridley Scott would finally win an Oscar for Best Director, but again he gets the shaft.
2716;I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an epic, and came home deadened and thanking God that there are other good movies to see.
2717;I enjoyed Gladiator so much that I saw it at least 3 times at the theater.
2718;This movie is filled with lavish sets and incredible performances.
2719;After an intense victory in the Colliseum, Emperor Comidus wants to meet this incredible gladiator (Maximus has a mask on while they re.
2720;There is political intrigue and action gallore.
2721;if you like russell crowe this is probally his finest movie to date.
2722;see how the general regains his past glory and the loyalty of his fellow soldiers.
2723;It is one of the most historically accurate, and well done movies for that era, but the story line though fictional is simply just spectacular.
2724;Well photographed and engrossing, but fundamentally unbelievable.
2725;Just enjoy the first toga romp for many a year.
2726;This movie is one of the greats!
2727;On the same scale as Braveheart, The Patriot, and Saving Private Ryan, it provides a moving storyline with captivating action.
2728;the cutting room scenes are excellent!
2729;I don't know why they had to take them out, but they provide real insight into the depth of the story.
2730;I purchsed the Extended Edition for her because I wanted her to have the best version of the movie available and I wanted the one I gave her to be more than what she was expecting to find.
2731;She was very excited to receive it and was surprised by all the additional content.
2732;It was an interesting story with some good action scenes but overall it is just another action movie.
2733;It's a little intense for people with mild tolerence, but definately worth seeing.
2734;I've seen it multiple times, and it's just as good every time as it was the time before.
2735;Politics, blood, battles, action, are just a few elements that this huge epic movie provides.
2736;The Visual Effects and sound, are the best ones I've seen and heard.
2737;It's not only a 12 oscar nominee and 5 oscar winner including Best Picture, it is the best epic movie ever made.
2738;The Commentary by Ridley Scott is worth of your time, and the HBO First Look Making Of, is more than interesting.
2739;scene provides an amazing feeling of madness surrounding Comodus.
2740;The Batlle scene, the Coliseum scene and the City of Rome scene proves that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors ever.
2741;The music that the master Hans Zimmer made for the movie is shocking, and the most important thing of all, in one way or another, you enjoy the movie, the story, the music, and many other details.
2742;One can start with its biggest start Russell Crowe, who in my opinion has instantly established himself into a premier Hollywood ICON with his role as Maximus the great.
2743;His role is so intense that it commands respect and well desired.
2744;This is definately the type of movie that brings a new approach to Roman history and Rome itself.
2745;the movie starts with a deep sense that Maximus is a leader, yet a very loyal follower with deep respect for his leader, Ceasar.
2746;It shows the respect an army has for its leader and reveals a respect for the soldier at first.
2747;this movie made Crows career, and he made the movie a good one.
2748;He was good in LA Confidential and great in this.
2749;the movie takes us to 4 locations, 5 if you count the Elysian fields.
2750;The portrayal of the Coliseum is magnificent.
2751;there are some clever scenes to the movie as well, well thought out interplays between the character and his or her actions.
2752;from the first effects of a great battle with the German tribes in the north to the last scene in the Coliseum, this movie with its epic proportions will not dissappoint you.
2753;it is a movie of courage and endurance.
2754;A good example of how someone who is at the end of their rope can more than hang on to live to conquer again.
2755;The sound is so great (with its brandnew DTS ES) you will feel the thrill and the action when those gladiators were fight in the colosseum.
2756;Feel the thrill and the action of this movie.
2757;Once upon a time, Hollywood made films like this on a regular basis.
2758;Russell Crowe sucessfully carries on the sword.
2759;sandal tradition with this star.
2760;making performance, bringing a newfound realism that past epics like 'Ben.
2761;The excellent cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix as the amoral Commodus, help to personify the debauchery and arrogance of ancient Rome, while Crowe delivers both as a man's.
2762;A fine epic, well worthy of its many awards.
2763;Good role for Crowe, well directed and appears to be fairly accurate of Roman Empire life
2764;Russell Crowe was the perfect pick for this role, he shines as usual as he effortlessly flows through this role.
2765;People will follow passionate leaders and this movie demonstrates that principle with great clarity.
2766;When one hears the name Ridley Scott, movies such as Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and even Thelma Louise instantly come to mind.
2767;Time to add a new classic to that list, one of the biggest movies of the year 2000 .
2768;Maximus is a general of the Roman Empire, one who has never even been to Rome yet he controls the respect of the entire army and the people.
2769;the movie opens with a huge battle in Germania led by the great Maximus.
2770;You see the respect the troops give him, and you see him in midst of the battle.
2771;maximus' owner is Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his final performance), who was also once a gladiator and won his freedom in the great coliseum of Rome.
2772;That single focus on revenge is really the core of the movie, as it centers mainly on Maximus.
2773;gladiator is a huge story, and the description above only covers the first half of the movie.
2774;most of the performances are great, especially Richard Harris, who was nearly perfect as a Caesar in the twilight of his life.
2775;the CGI work that was done to recreate the Roman Empire toward the end of its life span is excellent.
2776;the action scenes simply rock.
2777;They are intense, gory, and loud.
2778;The Battle of Carthage scene is awesome and worth the price of admission alone.
2779;In terms of action, this movie will rock you!Overall the movie has amazing action sequences, but a story that could have used a little trimming at the sides.
2780;Love, drama, Rome, Maximus, fighting.
2781;You will love the scene in the Coloseum when the emperor asks who the gladiator is.
2782;Acting and fighting is really great.
2783;everything about this movie is from a technical and entertainment standpoint very BAD.
2784;Worth a little extra money.
2785;Gladiator was a generally good movie that could have been better.
2786;About the sentimental moments
2787;Quick note: Scenery and costumes were excellent and gave you an idea of the Glory of Rome might have looked like.
2788;All in all, I'm glad I saw it and enjoyed it .
2789;gladiator, general maximus, is a great warrior of body, mind and spirit.
2790;a gladiator (Latin: gladiator, swordsman , from gladius, sword ) was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals.
2791;the origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate.
2792;Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.
2793;Just absolute great plot development, characters, and acting.
2794;I honestly think this is the best movie out there.
2795;So, when the Blue Ray (second generation) version of the movie was released, I bought it.
2796;would I recommend it to others, yeah, it is a good rendition and worthy of your collection.
2797;If you liked the theatrical version you will LOVE this version with the extra footage and visual clarity.
2798;THE action movie of summer 2000.
2799;I just took the time to see this movie, and now I finally understand the excitement.
2800;it is not your usual Hollywood movie and Crowe is simply outstanding .
2801;In some ways it is like the old epic movies, and the movie is a good combination of writing, cinematography, acting, plus the magnet personality of Crowe.
2802;It is like an old fashion Hollywood Roman movie with the chariot scenes, but then again it has a much more complicated an unpredictable plot plus it mixes in a bit of the surreal.
2803;Simply a great movie thatI had to watch twice in a row on the first viewing.
2804;it is that good and easy to understand the excitement and the awards.
2805;This movie won best picture at the Oscars and I wasn't at all surprised, as the Acadamy tends to NOT award the best picture of the year with the honor.
2806;A lot of people loved this movie and it's easy to see why: an underdog lead character and loads of action.
2807;era Hollywood epic and obviously turns to shreds.
2808;This is the best movie.
2809;When i finished i had loved it.
2810;This, had very good action, but it also had an enthralling plotline and GREAT actors.
2811;cuz i have sentimentle value attached to that).
2812;But, this was an OUTSTANDING move and well worth the money.
2813;Would you rather have that piece of paper with a number and a dead president on it, or an amazing, fun,action.
2814;I kept asking myself is this how grainy this picture is.
2815;Next time you ship something to somebody, make sure that you check the item and make sure it is as advertised.
2816;Very interesting and well done.
2817;The action never stops and special effects are amazing it's Rome be prepared to see people kill each other with what I call hardware store tools and swords and expect blood no shortage of that.
2818;My husband really likes this movie.
2819;This is a stellar movie.
2820;The storyline is much stronger than I honestly expected.
2821;Commodus' white armor at the end of the film is quite impressive.
2822;This is simply the best movie ever.
2823;It captures the best parts of Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan and puts them together for an awesome movie.
2824;Gladiator had very good actors and really got me into the scene of the Roman Empire.
2825;There is also a great deal of drama, which usually bores me, but here it really enhanced the movie.
2826;From the amazing opening battle to the heart.
2827;stopping end, Gladiator keeps you hooked the whole time and long after too.
2828;love this movie, well why wouldin't you love it when Russell Crowe is the lead star.
2829;YOu are sure to really like this movie, the end is really neat when he meets his wife and child
2830;I enjoyed Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenixs roles in this movie.
2831;Being a fan of the Roman Empire it was awesome to see the sets, costuming and weaponry of that time being used.
2832;my favorite of all time brand new and fast shipping
2833;GladiatorScore: 87/100When you make a movie about gladiator's, there is a good chance it's going to be great, since gladiator's are an easy premise to make a good movie out of.
2834;maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful Roman general, loved by the people and the aging Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).
2835;The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.
2836;gladiator is tremendous filmmaking done in a superbly Old.
2837;worthy as General Maximus and Emperor Commodus, and both hold the screen with such pure force that you can't rip your eyes away from their terrific expressions and heartfelt emotions.
2838;Ridley Scott's direction is full of effort and should be praised, and the set decorations are terrific.
2839;Russell Crowe, besides being sexy, gave a superior performance.
2840;I saw Russell Crowe in the insider, his performance in this film was superior to the insider.
2841;Hope the mail gets it to me fast.
2842;But it also gave hope to people knowing that there are still a few good men out there with unquestionable dignity, a true leader, living with principles, honor justice.
2843;i'll always remember Maximus' line re Stay with me.
2844;This may sound too morbid but it also shows you a part of his character.
2845;An encouraging suportive general to his followers, a person who manages to exhibit humor at the scariest time of their life, a person who gives you hope to stay together see the worst through.
2846;If you like Brave heart with Mel Gibson,Then you will like this film.
2847;it has great special effects and action sequences.
2848;it is the first time I have seen Russel Crowe act in this movie and he is the best.
2849;great action,excellent action and special effects,and is kind of a drama too.
2850;if you have never seen Gladiator,get it now,its the best movie
2851;edited version of the film has been!
2852;while some of the extra features are somewhat interesting, I found the Extended Edition to be a rip.
2853;This is the absolute best movie to come along in a long time!
2854;I own it, and even on my 20 T. v.,it was exciting and stiill able to make me cry!
2855;This movie is a GREAT movie.
2856;It was excellent special effects and a very good plot.
2857;This is my favorite movie, rossul crowe leads an excellent role for his character.
2858;Its riveting storyline, exquisite acting by Russell Crowe and Joaqim Phoenix, and spectacular re.
2859;creation of Rome has made this movie a true masterpiece and be remembered as one for many years to come.
2860;It has the making, documentary on ancient gladiators, and much more.
2861;i am very glad this movie has the won the truely deserved Best Motion Picture award at the recent Golden Globe Awards.
2862;Good Luck at the Academy Awards!
2863;Gladiator was a movie on a grand scale.
2864;Sometimes this culminated in awe.
2865;inspiring vistas and sweeping scenes.
2866;The story of a Roman general become fugitive become slave become gladiator, it paints a picture of life in the Roman empire as seen from several social levels and explores the gritty life of the gladiator.
2867;crowe's character, Maximus, is oringal and a good mix of tough and tender.
2868;This movie truly is carried by Crowe.
2869;The plot is quite predictable at points but the end surprised even me (I have seen so many movies that I can easily spot a cookie cutter plot and usually know how it will end half way through).
2870;It was a refreshing change.
2871;The computer graphics were amazing, especially the shots of the Colesseum, and there was a good balance between the grand sweeping shots and the small private moments that really let the audience get to know the characters.
2872;one thing that the movie did eccel at was recreating the glory and spectacle of the Roman Empire.
2873;Roman culture was well represented and history well meet if stretched at points.
2874;Another triumph of Gladiator was the soundtrack.
2875;It provided a beautiful counterpoint to the big events and subtly underscored the smaller moments.
2876;Plus it blended perfectly with the action in the battle scene and the death scene and really brought Elysium to life.
2877;This is one of my favorite movies!
2878;One of my favorite movies of all time is Braveheart and I had heard such glowing reviews of Gladiator and often comparisons to Braveheart that I couldn't wait to see it.
2879;This movie is so personal to me.
2880;What I question in the end is .
2881;But is that the wise man?
2882;a move that shakes my foundation.
2883;This is an amazing movie.
2884;All the actors did a stunning job of immersing you into the story.
2885;this movie is on my top 10 favorite movies.
2886;While the plot is thin and the historical perspective is off, the action in this film is superb.
2887;The openning battle is probably one of the best depictions of Roman warfare ever filmed.
2888;There are many movies out there that are action packed with a stiry line set in past times.
2889;It was, like, better than Braveheart!
2890;Dude, that was the best movie I've seen in years!
2891;Russel Crowe's gonna win Best Actor!
2892;And that Commodus guy was great!
2893;It will now be like that permanently, thanks to the Academy's ridiculous presumption that this was the best film of the year.
2894;Both of these films were twice as well.
2895;written, and ten times more satisfying to look at.
2896;And Crowe does an acting job that Schwartzenegger could have pulled off, but for some reason won an Oscar for it.
2897;Gladiators fighting against chariots is one of the best combat scenes ever made and make you understand why it took so long to outlaw gladiator fights in Rome.
2898;Je ne sais pas), the commentary (good to have) and the trivia track (nice to have).
2899;They could have done away with the French track to increase the bit rate.
2900;Although I'm disappointed I still have to say that the documentaries on disc 2 are very good.
2901;The movie Gladiator is a Ridley Scott film which is a Dreamworks and Universal production, and stars Russell Crowe as Maximus: the general who became a slave, who became a gladiator.
2902;Although Gladiator is rated R for intense, graphic combat, it is an excellent movie lasting a highly refreshing two hours and thirty.
2903;since Maximus had plenty of experience in battle, because he was an army general, he fought surprisingly well in the arena.
2904;Because of Maximus' great reputation, Commodus, (who is) now Emperor of Rome, not knowing that the great well.
2905;known gladiator is Maximus, decides one day to watch him fight.
2906;after reviewing the movie Gladiator, Jonathan Foreman of the New York Post stated, Russell Crowe is simply magnificent!
2907;Personally, I love the movie!
2908;Russell Crowe does such a fantastic job in this movie.
2909;Gladiator is the most extraordinarily powerful epic I've seen in a long time, in the tradition of such great films as Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart.
2910;It is awesome and grand in every sense of the words, as only a Ridley Scott film can be.
2911;Not only is the story poignant and unforgettable, but Russell Crowe's performance as the general who became a slave
2912;joaquin Phoenix also gives a powerful performance as the corrupted Ceasar of the Roman Empire.
2913;not only is the scope of the story grand and the acting superb, but the cinematography is just gorgeous.
2914;Gladiator, simply put, is a powerful epic that will be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time.
2915;It's just extraordinarily and superbly crafted in every area.
2916;This is probably one of the best movies I have seen lately.
2917;Although Gladiator is a movie where no expenditure was cut short, the true heart of it is the way it projects the timeless values of the betrayed, incredibly charismatic hero who fights until the end to avenge the death of his loved ones, with a past, unforgotten love lurking around all the time.
2918;We get a taste of life in Ancient Rome as well, with its vices and abuses and, above all, its grandeur .
2919;Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus gives an award winning performance for which he will be remembered forever as the actor of Gladiator .
2920;He gets deep into the emotions of Maximus, his character, showing us not only his bravery but also .
2921;and this is very important .
2922;Moreover he has the gift of a fantastic, deep voice, which adds to the drama of the story and wraps it up spectacularly with a soundtrack that is both glorious at times as well as morose.
2923;the scenes are shot with great care and realism.
2924;The one with the tigers is fantastic
2925;after Russell Crowe's marvel of a performance I second Oliver Reed's and Richard Harris'.
2926;Both masters of their task, they also give award winning performances
2927;gladiator who helps Maximus with his tactics
2928;i commend everyone in this film, especially the director, Ridley Scott, for giving us the opportunity to enjoy an epic of timeless values in our modern world, so much devoid of them.
2929;looks like a good old.
2930;but this is a real mano a mano .
2931;But the good guy dies as well, so he can rejoin his family in the great bye and bye.
2932;bet that surprised you, didn't it!Actually there is one highlight in the film .
2933;Oliver Reed, proving what a very talented actor he was when in the right mood.
2934;tip 2: If this film is so great, how come people are queueing up to sell their copy?
2935;This is a great and amazing action packed adventure what's great about this blu.
2936;The fight scenes are amazing and extremely detailed in the extra scenes.
2937;'Gladiator' by far is the BEST FILM I have seen this year!!
2938;It combines the values we are seeking once again of honor, duty, country, and to family, with old.
2939;Ridley Scott and company have produced a classic of a film that will be enjoyed for years to come.
2940;russell Crowe (Maximus) shines brightly amidst the backdrop of ancient Rome.
2941;He brings to the screen a passion rarely seen in a main character.
2942;Joaquin Pheonix(Commodus), is also superb in his role as the spoiled Prince who takes over for his dead father.
2943;The rest of the superb cast fill out the this epic drama.
2944;filled with action that puts one in the arenas of Rome, the oustanding soundtrack that pulls at one's emotions,and the special effects that details the epic feel of the Roman Empire.
2945;Gladiator is a classic hero tale which allows you to turn off the thinking.
2946;centres of your brain and just enjoy the adventure.
2947;Our Hero is a man and general of epic proportions, the Bad Guy is Very, Very Bad, and there is a strong female character conniving behind Caesar's back.
2948;Add to this some exciting and slightly gory swordplay and an amazing, award.
2949;winning soundtrack that flows perfectly through the movie, and you have a wonderful escapist experience.
2950;The story in this great movie .
2951;and I do think it is a great movie .
2952;the best movie of 2000 was Titus.
2953;The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare.
2954;im so excited about finding a three.
2955;Russell Crowe's best film for sure.
2956;As a people we have always been fascinated with what has come before us.
2957;Scientists and historians alike have dedicated themselves wholly to the project of determining where we came from, and how we got to where we are now.
2958;Further, all ancient civilizations which endured powerful, lenghty reigns.
2959;The era has fascinated me so much that I have choosen to dedicate a substantial amount of my time to the study of classics, and the Roman language, Latin.
2960;for me the film was a wonder.
2961;The special effects are incredibly well.
2962;But to me the key that makes a movie great is its ability to suck you in.
2963;for anyone who has ever felt the desire to be lost in the mystery and splendor of Ancient Rome, this movie is a must see.
2964;i enjoyed this movie a lot.
2965;Universal, in prepping the old, outdated transfer for release, smeared what is called digital noise reduction, or DNR, all over the picture, to remove both the natural film grain that provides facial detail and other wonderful Blu.
2966;The detail that justifies a Blu.
2967;ray upgrade, namely clear backgrounds and great facial detail, is GONE.
2968;The incredible battle scenes, music that blends really well with the action, Turneresque vistas of Rome, great costuming (it's probably all wrong as well but I for one don't really care).
2969;brat Emperor is just fun to watch and quite chilling in his callousness.
2970;His use of the Colosseum to keep the people happy has echoes of modern.
2971;definitely up there in my Top 10 films.
2972;Never have I been so profoundly affected by a film and I am one who has seen a great many.
2973;is a man who simply adores his family and home.
2974;You see a man who loves and is loved and manages to do all in the most dire of circumstances.
2975;In the spirit of Maximus, do yourself a favor and see the meaning of strength and honor .
2976;One of the finest Russell Crowe movies and indeed one of the all time great films to come out of Hollywood as we are propelled back to Imperial Rome as Crowe gives us a relentless General who became a slave who became an unstoppable gladiator to a man who defied an emperor while seeking to punish the man who destroyed his life.
2977;While the last Gladiator spectacle (Spartacus)was released some forty years ago both movies share development of charachters that interest us and make us want to know more.
2978;most of the roles in Gladiator are interesting and in every case we want to know more about these people.
2979;The Director allows us to learn the good and bad of people.
2980;It is easy to like Crowe's charachter as he stands for most of what we would like to think is right with people: noble, honest, loyal, etc. the characterization of Phoenix in the Commodus role is powerful as while he is clearly not a good person we can feel his pain and his need to be accepted by both his Father and his People.
2981;a superb movie at all levels which really breaks new ground in the epic genre.
2982;A special salute to Hans Zimmer for one of the most exciting and thought provoking musical scores in years.
2983;Also to Oliver Reed in his final role.
2984;This movie is destined to become a classic and should do quite well at the Golden Globes and Oscars in 2001.
2985;to take him to the Afterlife where he can be reunited with the only two people he loves in this world.
2986;When Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) whispers to him You're home she understand the nature of Maximus' epic journey to rejoin his family.
2987;Reed's performance was great, and sustained the dark nature of the film.
2988;Superb, all round good film.
2989;Very much look forward to seeing more of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scotts films in the future.
2990;The music score is awesome.
2991;it celebrates the triumph of the spirit against terrible odds.
2992;Russell Crowe's performance was outstanding .
2993;I loved the action and suspense and, of course, seeing a hero in action.
2994;He works his way to the coliseum and is soon the center of attention.
2995;He will get his chance.
2996;He challenges Caesar himself to a duel and the outcome is legendary.
2997;this is probably one of the most famous movies in American cinematic history.
2998;The acting and screenplay are both magnificent.
2999;This film is breathtaking in all aspects.
3000;It is an unforgettable experience.
3001;It captures both 'the glory that was Rome' as well as the relationship between a fighting commander and his troops, both used to hardship and victory, and attempting to finish the job and go home.
3002;this is also undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.
3003;It is reminiscent of the spectacles of the late 50s and early 60s, such as Ben Hur, El Cid, and 55 Days at Peking, but much more intense and certainly more realistic.
3004;'Director Ridley Scott has captured many things in this film: the timeless relationship between veteran soldiers and their commanders, Rome in its last spurt of greatness, evil and corruption of the Roman upper classes, the seeming hopelessness of good being overcome by evil, innocence of the young, and the recurring theme that evil will fluorish if good men do nothing.
3005;music is also superb, and undoubtedly brings out the violent action of the film, from rousing fighting in the Coliseum to savage combat on the Danube frontier between the indomitable Legions and the German barbarians.
3006;lastly, this was Oliver Reed's last film.
3007;Remembered for his portrayal of the one of the Three Musketeers in the mid.70s and in the film Oliver, he is superb here, dying of a heart attack while the movie was being filmed.
3008;The final product is a tribute both to him and his ability in front of the camera.
3009;this is a film for the ages.
3010;It covers valor, cowardice, loyalty, love, hate, betrayal, and brings it in a story that is enthralling, exciting, and relevant to modern times.
3011;The Director and cast, and the rest that contributed are to be congratulated.
3012;I saw it five times on the big screen and enjoyed it every time.
3013;Quite simply, it is superb.
3014;Gladiator is a story about the journey of a man as well as a light review on the workings of Rome.
3015;I watch it over and over, and even my most action movie fearing friends love it.
3016;The power of Russell Crowes character is moving even in its 15th viewing.
3017;An unbelievable circumstance is made highly believable primarily because of his performance.
3018;I was truly impressed to see such a movie come out of Hollywood.
3019;The casting was excellant and I was truly impressed that they choose a woman for the romantic lead that though truly hot actually looked the age of the character.
3020;this movie was a great exploration of the contrast between a real man (Maximus) and a poser (Commitus).
3021;i just wish I had another arm to be able to give it more than two thumbs up.
3022;This is one of my favorite movies.
3023;I was so happy to find it for such a great price and have watched in many time already.
3024;The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital.
3025;The extended edition scenes, however, look fine .
3026;in this transfer, you can see it in the image.
3027;arrows and fireballs disappear from one frame to the next.
3028;So there,make up your own mind.
3029;Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors and does not disappoint with this movie.
3030;the characters are pretty broad, but the cast is enjoyable to watch.
3031;but gives a twisted, juicy portrayal of Commodus, the ruler of Rome.
3032;the disc is a good value, with the commentary track by Ridley Scott and others being worth the price of admission.
3033;The transfer is pristine and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack will rock the house.
3034;The battle and arena scenes are spectacular.
3035;enjoy this one with plenty of popcorn.
3036;The Epic of a new decade, this movie was absolutely fantastic, perfect blend of action and plot.
3037;Right up there with Titanic as the best movie in the past ten years.
3038;If you have a real nice 5.1 system you will really enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
3039;This movie makes me a believer that hollywood is becoming more committed to making action movies with a good plot surrounding it.
3040;one of the best movies I ever saw, excellent acting, amazing music, and tragedian end.
3041;this movie deserves more than 5 stars.
3042;I admire the way the ending was handled.
3043;I was awed by Crowe's character's fighting skills.
3044;I especially liked that last fight.
3045;They did a very good job of recreating the Colliseum.
3046;It all looked so real.
3047;I really liked this movie because, while some scenes were dramatized, the creators paid close attention to the accurate details to make this movie as realistically accurate as possible.
3048;If you like action movies, thrillers, or romances, you will love this movie!
3049;This has got to be the best movie I have ever seen in my lifetime.
3050;Even though it contained quite a bit of blood I found the movie to be absolutely facinating I have owned the movie for a week now and have seen the movie and trailer at least 5 times already.
3051;I loved Gladiator, I've watched it 3 times now and I still love it.
3052;Everything looks so great in this film that you could watch it without sound and it would still be fascinating!
3053;It will keep you thinking about the Roman Empire and loyalty.
3054;It will keep you on the edge of your seats.
3055;This movie has a great storyline and I recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good movie.
3056;It is really long, but it is so beautiful and moving and the soundtrack is amazing.
3057;It is no wonder it won so many awards, it is a true masterpiece and if you are into historical movies or history, it is a treat.
3058;Russel Crowe is a champion and deserved teh oscar for his perfomance.
3059;gladiator is a friend of mine's favorite movie.
3060;My friend is a male model and studying acting, so I value his opinion.
3061;Actually, I value it more because he's a friend.
3062;I see this film won the Academy award.
3063;None of this convinces me this is a great movie.
3064;Perhaps the subtlety is what I Should have liked.
3065;I wonder if Commodus, the villain in the film, was actually a great man.
3066;Amazon will keep the move in cloud and i can watch it at any time
3067;As far as the genre goes, Gladiator is a cut above the rest.
3068;and the cinematography is spectacular.
3069;The feel and the plot are vintage Roman epic but the visual production is unmistakeably modern.
3070;Gladiator is alot of fun and is great entertainment, however, i'm still baffled as to why this got the Best Picture Oscar and Quills wasn't even among the nominees.
3071;Ok ya, Gladiator is a great movie.
3072;but i remember when i saw the colosseum i was amazed how huge and tall it was, and when we entered the colosseum, it really was an amazing sight.
3073;and the whole movie was great to watch.
3074;russel crowe is an amazing actor and you can definately see his talent in this movie.
3075;even though there were violent scenes that i found hard to watch, it is an excellent movie.
3076;Russell Crowe does a splendid job in this big budget period epic, playing the Roman General Maximus.
3077;crowe's performance is dynamic, even given that he growls his way through most of his dialogue.
3078;The action asequences are exciting, appropriately gory, and (as far as the Roman histories tell us) historically accurate.
3079;For those who have never seen SPARTACUS, GLADIATOR will be an original treat
3080;Someone I trust recommended this film to me, and someone I distrust said it was bad, so I decided to check it out, and was pleasantly surprised.
3081;admittedly, the thought of ancient Rome brings back images of ferocious lions and burning corpses to a Christian like myself, but I enjoy a good historical fiction as much as the next guy, and this film is certainly that.
3082;a trustworthy, courageous roman general named Maximus is rewarded by Caesar for his latest successful campaign, with the promise that when he dies, Maximus must take his place, returning Rome back from the brink of corruption and totalitarian rule.
3083;Commodus assassinates Caesar before he can make his plans known, rising to become the emperor and betraying Maximus, killing his family and trying to have him executed.
3084;His military experience and great strength and skill make him a natural in his new profession, but his heart still longs for one thing
3085;the one black spot on this movie's record in this regard is that ultimately, it is still a story about revenge.
3086;Most of the time, Maximus is essentially forced to fight and kill, and in one noteworthy instance, he actually shows mercy in a fight against a strong opponent
3087;ultimately, though, what I liked most about this film was the noble sacrifices made by the hero and his friends in the later parts of the film, and the movie's very clear message that there is an afterlife, and what you do in this life matters for that very reason.
3088;By no means would I consider this film perfect, but I definitely enjoyed it.
3089;I just bought it for the 17 minutes of extra footage, but this release is so much more than just that!The extra footage in itself is fantastic.
3090;The rest of the additional content is absolutely stunning and makes this a must.
3091;I was totally dissappointed in this epic movie.
3092;Not in the actor and actress, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with.
3093;This is one of the best movies out there.
3094;It has awesome effects and the gladiator fight scenes are sweet.
3095;I know that nobody expected the ending but in a few ways it makes the movie better.
3096;Very happy with the other two.
3097;This is the best movie i have ever seen and if you didn't see it yet, you need to!
3098;I thought nothing could top Spartacus, especially the love story between Spartacus and Varinia.
3099;There is a poetry in that screenplay that just sings and elevates.
3100;Certain values are timeless, and that is why this movie speaks to us.
3101;A spectacular movie with wonderful extras on the disc, this is one for the collection.
3102;Russel Crowe's commanding performance as Maximus is gritty and brilliant, and it's easy to see why Crowe won the best actor Oscar for the role.
3103;scott's visioanry trademark seen in films like Alien and Blade Runner is excellent, with huge CG re.
3104;Working with such an enormous scale and with such a big palet to use, Scott's unique talent for vivid and brutal storytelling is to the fore.
3105;notch stunt work and sharp visuals, the backgrounds, vistas and entire battlegrounds are done to masterful effect.
3106;Hans Zimmer's score for the film is a real romping, 'wake the neighbours up' soundtrack that is one of his best.
3107;The cinematography is astounding, with 'helicopter shots' over Rome, and the ear.
3108;the acting is really impressive, with legendary actors Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the late Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo, a slave dealer who trains Maximus.
3109;But this is Russel's movie, and his performance is brilliant, combining ferociousness with pathos.
3110;makers, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary from Scott, trailers, T. v spots, production notes, cast and filmmaker's notes and more fascinating production info.
3111;It is a great movie and he enjoys watching it.
3112;Russell Crowe did a fabulous job portraying the main character, Maximus, and all the supporting actors were absolutely fabulous.
3113;The plot was somewhat captivating and easy to follow.
3114;The transfer is absolutely atrocious.
3115;In all respects, Gladiator is the perfect movie that should and does appeal to both men and women.
3116;For all, this exceptional epic silver screen masterpiece brings to life the intriguing story, filled with deception, deceit and heroic valor, of a Roman General who was on the precipice of becoming the Roman Emperor who then, by a twist of fate, became a slave and slave who became a gladiator and a gladiator who defied the Emperor himself.
3117;few movies, with the exception of The Lord of the Rings can truly compare with the epic nature of this film that tells its tale with such intrigue and a truly compelling plot that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat from the opening sequence to the end credits.
3118;Joaquin Phoenix played the part of the mentally unstable Commodus to perfection and the ever beautiful Connie Nielsen as Lucilla performed brilliantly.
3119;Richard Harris' brief but poignant appearance as Emperor Markus Aurelius serves quite poignantly in showing what a brilliant actor he was and his talents will be and are sorely missed in the film industry.
3120;director Ridley Scott who has brought forth such huge films as Alien, Black Hawk Down and Blade Runner, shows his talents as an exceptional director quite brilliantly in this film and he deserves every last accolade he earned for this stunning and memorable film.
3121;The score for the film matches perfectly with every scene, lending brilliantly to the mood and atmosphere.
3122;As is Maximus' talent he is able to free himself from the Praetorians and begins the long journey home, only to find that his wife and son are dead.
3123;i highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all fans of this genre and who love what movie making is all about because Gladiator is one the definitive films of all time.
3124;Treasure Chest: A unique montage of additional footage cut to the powerful score.
3125;Interview with award winning composer Hans Zimmer on scoring the film.
3126;In depth production notes and detailed cast and filmmaker biographies
3127;This film spans the fathoms of the human soul, evoking every emotion found in the heart of man at every turn.
3128;Not just a tremendous special FX movie, but one with a beautiful story line.
3129;It is the story which carries this movie all the way to the end.
3130;If you are a fan of Braveheart and other historical type films, this film is a must see and a must own.
3131;This was a great movie!
3132;Russell Crowe made Maximus totally believable and this film gives you an insight into Roman history.
3133;Except for a couple of things, it is true to the historical happenings.
3134;It brings the animalistic side of humanity to the forefront while balancing it with the spiritual side of the main character.
3135;Well written, well acted, and not a trace of sex or 4 letter words, even the battle scenes are done as tastefully as possible.
3136;I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes, cringing at the actions of Commodus and cheering for Maximus when he proves what it is to really be a man.
3137;Incorporated into this version from the original 155 min movie?GLADIATOR is my absolute favorite movie of all time up to this point.
3138;Russell Crowe was definitely at his best in Gladiator playing the fierce warrior Maximus.
3139;I thought this movie had some of the most mezmerizing fight scenes and special effects ever mastered on the screen.
3140;I especially loved the whole arena atmosphere it took place in.
3141;Joaquin Pheonix also does an outstanding job at being a tyrant in this movie.
3142;I have to give this movie 2 thumbs up!
3143;Wonderful!I havn't seen the extended version, but the original is one of the best movies ever(It's in my personal top two and gaining)!
3144;The plot is beautiful and uplifting, with a hero you root for and a villan that is one of the best(aka most evil) ever to grace the silver screen.
3145;Gladiator would have to be one of the best movies ever made.
3146;The storyline and battle scenes are wonderful and the acting is stunning.
3147;Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as well as the handsome Joaquin Phoenix.
3148;A really good hero/villain duo.
3149;I think most people have seen this movie, but if not this has been called many times by many people the best hero movie of all.
3150;century Rome in this rousing historical epic that proudly harkens back to such films as BEN.
3151;The film features a terrific battle sequence (that recalls the beginning of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), huge crowd scenes of thousands of people, and even a little romance, albeit mostly taboo.
3152;GLADIATOR is a glorious spectacle filled with heart and soul.
3153;Now he goes back in time to create the most incredible vision of Rome ever to be put on film.
3154;The film achieved the most unique and spectacular fight scenes ever to be put on film.
3155;Russell gives a Performance that should establish him among the best.
3156;The script is pure and poetic.
3157;Aided by a huge supporting cast including Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed.
3158;The Han Zimmer Score is thunderous and alive aided by the Beautiful voice of Lisa Gerald.
3159;Enough action to satisfy my son and husband and enough heart and soul that you admire the character study of an honorable man who is an inate leader.
3160;Great performances by so many.
3161;This movie has the three ingredients that are required for success in the new milennium: spectacular digital effects, strong actors and an excellent plot.
3162;Russell Crowe brings his character to life, move over Bruce Willis, Russel Crowe is the new action hero.
3163;The climactic end is frosting on the cake, and the digital effects bring Rome to life.
3164;This movie was lots of fun.
3165;The story was so gritty and affecting.
3166;Ancient Rome burned in my heart.
3167;The characters are so compelling, deep and human.
3168;Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty.
3169;The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes.
3170;ridley Scott created a beautiful film.
3171;The cinematography was masterful .
3172;A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting and begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space.
3173;This movie brings everything to life, from the spectacular screenplay to the outstanding Score.
3174;I give it 5.5.5.6 all hands and feet.
3175;Of GLADIATOR it suffices to say that it is magnificient and a wonderful return to grand cinema making of olden days.
3176;Understated acting and a finely drawn female character whose dilemma is truly touching and engaging.
3177;Nielsen is the perfect choice for the role.
3178;Gorgeous and so far from the assembly line beauty of American female talent.
3179;Shame on the Academy for bypassing this superb performance, this unique artist.
3180;(One performance to watch this film for is the characteristically over the top Arab slave trader and ex.
3181;champion gladiator played by the late Oliver Reed.
3182;Great tale of a Roman general, Maximus, who under dire circumstances is forced to become a gladiator.
3183;It is a heart wrenching tale of one man's struggle to survive against all odds with the only thing keeping him going is his hope for revenge against the one man that destroyed his life.
3184;The historical accuracy of the movie is amazingly good in reference to how the Colosseum was composed and some of the methods of fighting.
3185;Of course as in all other movies everything is dramatized to fit entertainment value but even with that Gladiator is a striking example of ancient Roman construct.
3186;I have always liked Russell Crowe and this is just an epic with great acting and great era film and filming,
3187;A wonderfully intriguing and complex story.
3188;Often overlooked in the critiques, but also very good is Connie Neilsen, the multi.
3189;Crowe, Phoenix and Neilsen give wonderful performances in this larger than life epic.
3190;Destined to be played again and again at my house.
3191;The sound track alone is worth the price.
3192;This is a very good, well acted movie.
3193;the general, Maximus, esteemed by all the legionaires that he commands, is a favorite of the Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius.
3194;The Emporer has a son, Commodus, and a daughter, Lucilla.
3195;This is all I will tell you about the plot.
3196;Watch the movie and see for yourself.
3197;suffice to say that Russell Crowe gives a masterful and powerful perfomance as Maximus.
3198;His role is not a majestic, heroic one, but for that reason alone, his performance is, to my mind, the more compelling one, as it is stangely moving.
3199;If there are any Oscar recognized performances to be eked out of this film, he should certainly receive strong consideration for best supporting actor.
3200;This is a movie for the classics.
3201;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
3202;I loved this movie, but it is a little long around the middle, and some of the fight scenes are just okay whereas others are brilliant, but otherwise this movie is still really good.
3203;Such haunting glory, such subdued greatness.
3204;Crowe, Phoinex and Neilsen all act with Oscar worthy preformances.
3205;Gladiator will take you from a quiet villa in ancient Spain to the over.
3206;packed streets of the greatest empire on earth.
3207;Gladiator contains one of the most glorious soundtracks I have ever heard.
3208;tingeling score worthy of any award.
3209;I especially loved the song played during credits, Now We Are Free .
3210;Gladiator is for anyone who loves action, adventure, romance and characters so deep with emotion you cannot help but watch it again.
3211;It can definitely be classified as an all.
3212;This was a widely acclaimed movie.
3213;This is a well written, acted, directed story about extreme tragedy and triumph, with lots and lots of blood.
3214;I am sure we will watch it over and over for many years to come!
3215;Would recommend it to everyone over the age of 14.
3216;it has it's gruesome moments, but worth closing your eyes to see the rest of the movie!
3217;It really is that good.
3218;Crowe did an outstanding acting job.
3219;There a re a lot of extras that give you insight into the film making process.
3220;Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see B1R2.
3221;price for Gladiator when it first was released because I was so impressed with the trailer.
3222;Besides, one of Gladiator's themes is that everyone deserves fairness and dignity, whether slave or free, white or black, man or woman.
3223;The enormous video price for this film insults this value, allowing the few to enjoy this film just in time for Christmas.
3224;It quite a long movie but I enjoyed all of it.
3225;i even enjoyed the scenes that finally were cut as I had to hear director's comments.
3226;There is also an hour documentary on the history of gladiators and believe it is very interesting.
3227;You will enjoy finally the how was shooted part where you will see all the fantastic graphics and tricks as well as laugh with Russel's Crow comments.
3228;I love this movie,I enjoyed watching it and i have watched it many times since I received it from amazon
3229;This is a good movie.
3230;Russel Crowe delivers a strong performance as a wronged general, slave and then of course, gladiator.
3231;The best elements of the movie are the splendid battles and the action filled contests of the colliseum.
3232;The digital effects are riveting if somewhat gory.
3233;A fine adventure, low on story and high on sword slash.
3234;This was a great action packed movie.
3235;can there be a more versatile actor today than Russell Crowe, especially when he's directed by the great Ridley Scott.
3236;The faces honestly look like something out of a wax museum.
3237;and important in character revelation.
3238;A truly good movie, while not a five.
3239;star masterpiece, that should be recommended (and enjoyed) by everyone.
3240;I've taken the time and gone through all the reviews of this film, and for the most part, their all great.
3241;my review of the film is simply this: an unmistaken masterpiece.
3242;second, Ridley Scott's direction is spot on perfect, balancing the importance of storytelling with eye.
3243;His use of visuals to convey an emotion put him in a category with Hollywood's greatest.
3244;The script is tight, and taught, and chock full of emotion, never confusing the moment.
3245;oliver Reed, a character actor from the 60's and 70's, who passed away while shooting, has done some of the best work of his career here.
3246;Definitely a great epic movie, Gladiator, brings to the screen the story of the Roman general Maximus, as he seeks revenge against the Roman emperor for the killing of his family and the injustices that have been done against him.
3247;maximus' quest takes us from Rome to North Africa and back all the while providing an extraordinary plot along with some great scenery.
3248;the film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical adventures after a long dormant period.
3249;in short, it is a movie worth watching!
3250;The acting and the movie decor were skillfully done and very impressive.
3251;The story was quite touching.
3252;The first part of the movie is merely okay, but once Maximus enters the arena, the real fun begins.
3253;Fantastic, imaginative fight scenes which even got my adrenaline going, and I'm a nerd who wears bows on her shoes.
3254;Great recreations of Rome and the Colosseum, in addition to lovely costuming and a decent supporting cast, some of whom chomp at the scenery.
3255;Gladiator is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a very long time.
3256;Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar.
3257;I hope Gladiator wins the Best Movie!!!
3258;I have seen this movie several times and I always love it!
3259;wOW is all I can say!
3260;This is one of the best movies you will see in a very long time.
3261;It features great
3262;Russell Crow is once again wonderful in this movie.
3263;Very moving, and he gives as good as he gets.
3264;And I hold similar films to a very high standard.
3265;that said, the Gladiator does have some good points.
3266;Richard Harris as the dying Caesar is wonderful, and Oliver Reed as the gladiator slave dealer is great.
3267;This last film of his is a great legacy to his talent as I understand he died during its filming.
3268;Undoubtedly this role will spark his career.
3269;the action scenes were done with the best of computer graphics.
3270;Some of the scenes are done well, such as when Maximus turns the gladiators into an army and they fight against several teams of chariot fighters.
3271;Mostly, it held my interest.
3272;There's a feeling of history and ancient Rome.
3273;And its a way to escape from our own personal stresses.
3274;I can recommend it on that level.
3275;He was far better in A Beautiful Mind.
3276;the most obvious predecessor to this movie is Kirk Douglas' Spartacus.
3277;You'll find it strangely reminiscent of a lot of this movie, especially the music and Elysium depictions of his wife in the afterlife.
3278;But frankly, Hercules is more entertaining than Gladiator, and of course so is Spartacus.
3279;Movies like this just confuse the popular uneducated public.
3280;He's one of my favorite actors.
3281;He does an amazing job playing the role of gladiator who lost his family
3282;Gladiator is in my humble opinion, a near perfect movie.
3283;It works on so many levels .
3284;the acting is phenomenal, the story is compelling, the backdrop of the film is beautiful.
3285;It is destined to be a classic, and is a movie that can be watched and appreciated with each subseqent viewing.
3286;I personally felt that a movie this epic, deserved cooler packaging for it's remastered Sapphire Series release.
3287;great epic battles, great characters, a plot that had a great beginning, middle and end.
3288;Gladiator's UK and German releases are also far better looking than the US release.
3289;I own the bond steelbooks and they are pride and joy of my growing (350 and counting) blu.
3290;thank you for your participation and happy holidays to everyone!!
3291;The sapphire version is definitely the nicely remastered version.
3292;still worth the watch with enough blood, sweat and tears to please the whole family.
3293;gladiator holds promise for a heroic story with a liberal dosing of medieval battles.
3294;Admittedly, the chariot battle is stunning, with its breathless sense of urgency that the filmmakers captured here.
3295;One area that deserves accolade is the incredible sound.
3296;gladiator is a megaproduction that you have to watch a few times to really appreciate, with the exception of Ridley Scott's direction.
3297;all in all, its worth viewing once.
3298;If you want to be entertained, watch this movie.
3299;The actual gladiatorial scenes were well organised and thought out.
3300;For Russell Crowe supply Stephen Boyd, for Joaquin Phoenix supply Christopher Plummer, for Richard Harris supply Alec Guinness, for Connie Nielsen supply Sophia Loren.
3301;Of all the films involving gladiators, Spartacus is still the best.
3302;Well I watched this at home after having seen it at the movies when it first came out and I enjoyed the second viewing.
3303;screen feature but perhaps I'll upgrade systems in the future and enjoy the full effect.
3304;This movie is one of my favorites.
3305;Russell Crowe was great in it, and everything was just perfect.
3306;Loads of fighting, and teary eye moments.
3307;You'll cheer on Maximus 'til the end.
3308;This movie is the best movie I have seen in years.
3309;The actors, costumes, and the fight sceens are amazing.
3310;The plot of the story keeps on revealing and shocking the viewer.
3311;This movie will keep you watching until the end.
3312;Man, this is supposed to be a really good movie, so I had high hopes.
3313;By far the best movie of the new millenium.
3314;Ridley Scott triumphs with this epic tale of love, hate, revenge, and war.
3315;It has more action than Alien, more visual beauty than Legend, and more compassion than Thelma and Louise.
3316;Rusell Crowe gives an oscar worthy performance,as does Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.
3317;The visual and sound effects in this movie are beyond amazing.
3318;If you can only see one movie in 2000 see this.
3319;[I] always knew the Oscars were BS, but now I really know it for sure!
3320;not a perfect film but surely more Oscar.
3321;I will grant that this type of epic drama is best suited for the big screen, not chopped up for television, but .
3322;The special effects, scenery, etc. look good but, as with the recent Star Wars movies, the window dressing doesn't really matter.
3323;Having said that, I'll still stand by the bit of it which did make it through.
3324;I like action and period films if they're well done.
3325;This movie is one of my favorites, It never gets old!
3326;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
3327;Great script, great actors, THE BEST soundtrack.
3328;You will love the good guy.
3329;It's easy to love and hate the right people here and the action sequences are pure eye candy.
3330;is a fairly accurate depiction of Roman battle strategy.
3331;it's not an ornate film, but it delves quite nicely into one man's love for home and family rising above else that he believes in.
3332;My favorite movie of all times.
3333;Great movie that's even better on BR!
3334;Color is vibrant and the picture is crisp!
3335;the action sequences int hsi movie are great and the story line is easy to follow and also very interesting this is an American classic
3336;I think that this movie is by far one of the greatest movies Russel Crowe has done.
3337;His performance is excellent and the storyline just moved me.
3338;It was great how a man who was once a General leading the Roman Empire to victory could become a slave and forgotten.
3339;Then return as a Gladiator and steal the hearts of the Roman Empire once again.
3340;the ending is moving but he is home with his family!
3341;This was the best action film of the summer, the story keeps you interested from the very beginning to the end, I have not seen anything lately comparable to the fight with the charioteers in the circus!
3342;I hope they will issue a version with a decent transfer, this movie deserves one.
3343;The scenes are a little darker due to the setting or time period, but it is very well done.
3344;Action packed with romantic scenes.
3345;Gladiator is an amazing movie.
3346;We really enjoyed watching it from beginning to the end.
3347;We would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of films.
3348;is that why people liked it?
3349;a pleasure to business with.
3350;they even show you how they did it!Amazing and true dedication to their art.
3351;with digital technology of last tip, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us of return the glory that was Rome.
3352;on the verge of dying, the emperor Marcus Aurelius decides of naming as his successor to Maximus, general of his army, with the hope that he protect to Rome and he return the power to the town.
3353;But its ambitious, determined son Commodus to comply not the will of his father will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire.
3354;the epic movies returned to the large thing.
3355;Reviving all the pomp and ceremony of the old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle them with extraordinary battles, scenes of realistic fight and some admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.
3356;russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator
3357;His Maximum is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.
3358;the remainder of the distribution is magnificent, since the selection of Joaquin Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy they are palpable, to Richard Harris in their small but stunning role of Marcus Aurelius.
3359;under the right hand direction of Ridley Scott .
3360;who removes the best of the hyphen supported by a range of technological tools.
3361;Gladiator succeeds to find a perfect balance between action and emotion.
3362;His main focus is in the personages and the flow of a history that captures the importance of our actions.
3363;Its protagonists emit vitality, in the country of battle, in the bloody sand and above all, they convince us completely that is worth while to live or to die for the values and ideal that we carry inside.
3364;My husband really likes this movie.
3365;I like the story line quite well, but I find it a bit too gory.
3366;Great movieI could watch it over and over.
3367;My husband loves it also, he is the one who wanted to order it
3368;This was a great movie.
3369;Russel Crowe has been dissed for his acting, but my most humble opinion is that he did a good job.
3370;The movie is one of the best I have ever see.
3371;It is worth all of the money, you will spend on it.
3372;Oh yeah, and if you are over emotional like Me, you will probably cry through the last twenty minutes!
3373;The ending is fitting however.
3374;A Gladiator of a film, with a leading man to match.
3375;This was truely the best film of the year and deserving of the much used desriptive `epic`.
3376;Outstanding performances from all of the cast but surely the most watchable, by Russell Crowe, who fills his character to the the full (literally and figuratively).
3377;I watched it, I enjoyed it, I watched it again and will do so over and over.
3378;Absolutely reasonable product for the price!
3379;A Roman epic, a Loyal Roman's Odyssey, a movie that makes you cheer and cry for the good guy.
3380;a great and respected General, Maximus (Russell Crowe) helps Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the Roman Emperor, win another battle.
3381;He also crucifies Maximus' wife and son, who Maximus loves dearly, but hasn't seen in almost three years.
3382;The gladiators are brought to Rome by Commodus as a ploy to entertain and thus gain allegiance of the people.
3383;while the sound track will not be on the top ten hits list, it works well with the story line and helps build suspense and mood.
3384;The script makes the characters and plot believable.
3385;The acting of Crowe and Phoenix make it come to life with the help of director Ridley Scott (Hannibal, G. i Jane, Alien, Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner and Someone to Watch Over Me, to name a few).
3386;Nielsen (Mission to Mars, Soldier, Devil's Advocate and Voyage) is beautiful, loyal, and convincingly sincere in her fear of her brother and in her love for Maximus.
3387;He played and looked the part of a retired Gladiator that shows the Spaniard how to win the crowd's favor.
3388;My secretary, I'll just say she is over 50 years of age, said I loved it!
3389;I like action movies but my wife does not
3390;We felt the battles, scenery, and roles played by the actors were very realistic.
3391;This movie is not unlike Braveheart and The Patriot, both of which have there bloody scenes but they are offset by intensity and captivating roles of the characters.
3392;Beyond the blood, the acting is good, the scenery and the coliseum are beautiful, but can't be appreciated on TV like on the big screen.
3393;The plot is well thought out, and the story moves along making the two and a half.
3394;If you know and love this movie you will love this Blue Ray version.
3395;Those clay pots, filled with Greek fire, blazing through the air and finally smashing into a a tree with spot on audio of what a clay pot sounds like breaking into a hundered pieces.
3396;Worth every penny in my estimation.
3397;I do enjoy action movies, but this one didn't fit into that category imho.
3398;Great job on the part of Crowe.
3399;This is one of my boyfriend's favorite movies.
3400;It's a little dramatic but has a great villain.
3401;Gladiator marks the return of those epic movies about the Roman Empire of the 50's and 60's i. e. Spartacus, Ben Hur that seemed bigger than life.
3402;It is a grand spectacle of a movie that contains amazing fight and electrifiying battle scenes (think about the opening 15 minutes of the movie.
3403;as well as superlative performances from not only Russell Crowe, who richly deserved his Best Actor award, but from an assortment of wonderful British actors i. e. Richard Harris, David Hemming, Oliver Reed.
3404;Maximus is loved by Richard Harris .
3405;In addition, he also decides to have Maximus' wife and son crucified as well.
3406;Shortly thereafter, he is found by Oliver Reed and banished to Reed's gladiator school.
3407;He commands much of the time on the screen and it's impossible to take your eyes off of him.
3408;he's a natural leader of other men and it's remarkable to see him exert his leadership skills over the other gladiators who have also been captured and enslaved into this life.
3409;like many of the great Hollywood historical epics, Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly.
3410;What sets this movie apart is that it manages to perfectly blend sweeping action scenes and great computer effects with a wonderful story and magnificent performances from both the leading and supporting cast.
3411;it never allows the special effects or grandeur of the scenery overshadow the basic storytelling of a slave / gladiator who is taking on the most powerful man in the world.
3412;This movie essentially tells a story that may not be entirely original, but it is told in an honest and forthright manner and is believable.
3413;Maximus is a decent man who is committed to a singleness of purpose .
3414;Best known for Blade Runner and Alien, Scott has managed to create an incredible canvas that conjures up the majesty that must have been ancient Rome.
3415;they succeeded on a level that is not very often acheived.
3416;it's no surprise that this movie successfully managed to be both a commercial and artisitic success and will appeal to both men and women.
3417;This movie is almost perfect in every way!
3418;hur , Spartacus , and the others.
3419;Top it all with a big Hollywood.
3420;style happy ending ( Rome the Republic .
3421;When he shouts to one audience, Do I entertain you?
3422;But I guess he fills out a skirt nicely, so the ladies have something to look at.
3423;Go for it you want them .
3424;style political correctness, and you have the mediocre mush of Gladiator .
3425;An action flick with great battle sequences and enough story to fill the gaps.
3426;what this movie did have was incredible cinematography and top flight action sequences.
3427;The initial battle in Germania was amazingly shot.
3428;I did find myself losing concentration at times in between the battles, but very much enjoyed the movie never.
3429;You could truly enjoy explore all the other features on these discs for a long time to come.
3430;The CG panoramic shots of Rome definitely show their age, but the picture and sound are crystal clear, and the story line and action are still spectacular.
3431;It is a solid transfer of a still great movie.
3432;The plot won't win an award, but the sets, props, effects, action, and acting certainly might.
3433;This is your basic Roman political intrigue movie using modern filming practices and it looks impressive.
3434;The battles and fights are wonderfully done.
3435;Aside from the rather liberal historical modifications, I think Ridley Scott did a smashing job with this film.
3436;Definitely in leagues with other masterpieces such as Blade Runner and Alien.
3437;the musical score is very good, and it's made all the more better by lisa gerard's contributions.
3438;the actions scenes are good.
3439;Russell Crowe's acting is very good.
3440;Worth the price, this is the movie that made Russell Crowe a super star, and made a fan out of me!
3441;GLADIATOR is absolutely riveting, capturing your attention immediately!
3442;first off, the recreation of battles, Roman army camps, and ancient Rome are abolutely amazing!
3443;but the story is good enough that you still may want to see it anyway, even if you have to cover your eyes at times!
3444;it illustrates the barbaric nature of things back in that century and is actually an important part of the story as a whole.
3445;maximus, the main character, is a person with high moral standards who ends up being kidnapped and sold as a slave .
3446;This film will touch you to the core and you will think about it for days!
3447;An older movie but it's an awesome action movie!
3448;Russell Crowe was a great actor in this film.
3449;I bought it for my boy friend because he still had in on VHS and it's time to replace it.
3450;Not only a good movie but relates some fascinating historical fact as well as fiction.
3451;I recommend this movie highly.
3452;it works perfectly on my laptop's blu ray disc drive.
3453;Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments.
3454;Austrailian Russell Crowe convinces me he is a Roman general and a good one at that.
3455;This movie is as historically accurate as Hollywood gets.
3456;the Emperor Commodus probably did not have inner child issues portrayed here, but they are well done.
3457;the Gladiatorial arena is very vividly and accurately portrayed.
3458;Also the battle scenes are the best ever done.
3459;a+ all around, see this movie!!!!
3460;This movie is not for people with a weak tolerance for violence, but if you bring yourself to see it, you will understand, as many others do, why this movie is the most intense film ever!
3461;This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3462;Russell Crowe gave an excellent performance and the fight scene were nothing short of spectacular.
3463;Gladiator begins with a rousing battle scene and has many to follow, all of the acting credible and the story is undeniably interesting, but there are too many flaws for this one to be considered a masterpiece by any means.
3464;Gladiator combines the Epic film of the past with the sensibilities and technology of the present.
3465;Gladiator had the ability to meld every human emotional theme imaginable through sight and sound and keep me riveted to the screen for the whole 2 1/2 hours.
3466;The ensemble acting is Superb.
3467;The additional footage and special features on the 2nd disc are just as compelling as the movie itself.
3468;era epic GLADIATOR wanders into fictional territory, despite the rootedness of a few individuals in actual history.
3469;telling talents to expand and explore, creating tapestries that range from very historical to almost entirely (or entirely) nonhistorical.
3470;Instead, here is a story with interesting characters going through some provocative change and circumstance, in which the two subset stories of (1) Commodus and Lucilla in Rome and (2) Maximus in Africa come together for an almost fate.
3471;initiated clash of calculating spite that climaxes in a slave.
3472;The story exhibits a respectable measure of originality
3473;favorite general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, for the role.
3474;head to Rome for an unforgettable matchup.
3475;and that and other elements enrich the story, making it more palatable for [modern Western] viewers.
3476;Other strong appearances by Jacobi and Hounsou add to the appeal.
3477;Plus great directing by Ridley Scott (especially during the action sequences), well.
3478;positioned cinematography, and a rousing score.
3479;For all of its shortcomings in the historical files, GLADIATOR has scope and grandeur.
3480;Film, more than any other art, has the wherewithal to create an epic tale.
3481;One reason is that the medium is literally larger than life.
3482;Another reason is that most people who make movies are gamblers by nature.
3483;The three most successful movies of all time are Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, and Titanic.
3484;Each had an epic tale to tell.
3485;Since Titanic was released just three years ago, it appears that this form of movie making is as popular as ever.
3486;Artistically, it's as good as almost epic I can think of.
3487;Winning the battle will bring to Rome and its emperor, Marcus Aurelius [Richard Harris], peace for the first time in years.
3488;After the battle, which is a most intense and brilliantly orchestrated piece of film making, Marcus gives Maximus, whom he loves like a son, many new responsibilities, though Maximus wants nothing more than to return to his farm in Spain and to his wife and son.
3489;Lucilla, who also loves Maximus, can do nothing, for fear that Cummodus will harm her young son.
3490;in Gladiator Russell Crowe has finally found his way to major stardom.
3491;He is perfect as Maximus, giving him a macho facade that masks a loyal, caring and intelligent man.
3492;Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career to date as Cummodus.
3493;The two actors make formidable onscreen adversaries in several chilling scenes, most of which take place in a nicely rendered vision of the Roman Coliseum as it might have appeared all those years ago.
3494;Connie Nielson gives the wily and brilliant Lucilla a majesty reminiscent of Cate Blanchette in Elizabeth.
3495;Bringing added depth to the movie are three older actors .
3496;director Ridley Scott is one of the best, bringing elegance, style and substance to most of his movies.
3497;He had directed such diverse pictures as Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise.
3498;and these shots show much more fine detail, much less edge halo, and better color fidelity.
3499;So it kind of slaps you in the face when you return to the film proper.
3500;frame my way through an entire film looking for problems.
3501;I try to let it breathe, and if it is still a pleasing presentation despite flaws, to enjoy it on its own terms.
3502;Gladiator does deliver in this respect.
3503;Usually, the strongest elements are close.
3504;up shots of faces and armor.
3505;Medium and distance shots, especially the Rome fly.
3506;some are nice and inky, while others are a gray mush.
3507;the soundtrack is fine, in a generally well.
3508;extras include two strong commentaries, an EXTREMELY long and exhaustive making of feature on disc 2, and many, many, many small vignettes on Roman history, production, and all sorts of minutiae.
3509;It really is an impressive assortment, except that all, sadly, are in Standard Definition.
3510;When I first saw it, I found it an engaging swords and sandals affair with a nice historical flair and a rousing storyline.
3511;I've now seen it a good 10 times, though, over the past 10 years.
3512;It's still a rousing action spectacle.
3513;Crowe is an action star par excellence, as well as a fine dramatic actor.
3514;Various supporting characters are also nicely portrayed.
3515;outs, only serving to advance the plot, without an internal life of their own.
3516;If you want to see a telling contrast, watch Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus, another gladiatorial epic.
3517;It is by no means a perfect presentation.
3518;So it's a tough recommendation.
3519;so call it a qualified recommendation with a caveat emptor for the enthusiast crowd.
3520;Few movies come along during our lives that make us stop in our tracks and take notice.
3521;Ridley Scott's epic of Roman General, Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) is a movie that commands attention.
3522;on the musical side, Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard composed a score that is as moving as it is dramatic.
3523;Nearly of the score coincides directly with key points in the film and add just that extra touch to the scene.
3524;and that is exactly what this film gives us, a vision.
3525;The deleted scenes and documentaries are a very novel touch.
3526;the sound editing on this movie should win an Oscar.
3527;i love the extras in this movie.
3528;I gave this movie a 5 star rating because the story line was great, with good actors and lots of action.
3529;if anyone is really interested in seeing a great movie this is it.
3530;i would highly recommend this movie.
3531;This was one of the best movies I have seen in the year 2000!
3532;The griping story of the hero Maximos kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire show!
3533;The delivery was fast and to the door delivery.
3534;It has great action and Russell Crowe fits the role of Maximus perfectly.
3535;The special effects are sweet!
3536;absolutely fantastic movie with very realistic war scenes and a good story.
3537;A bench mark in this type of period movie.
3538;ridley Scott is a genius!
3539;Gladiator is about what a man has to do to become more than just a man.
3540;hur has there been a great sandle movie.
3541;Harry say's this was a great film, he's right.
3542;I love this film, it's been 4 years sense it first came out, and the ending still touches me emotionaly.
3543;Historical experts will find things to nitpick in this film, but casual viewers are sure to enjoy this.
3544;The acting, story, costumes, and backdrops are great, you can tell a lot of effort went into this.
3545;overall, it really is a good movie telling the story of a soldier who falls victim to the jealousy and intrigues of other people, and the story is nicely paced with some great scenes, like when he talks with the new Emperor's nephew, or the scenes between Commodus and his sister, or what happens between Commodus and his father near the beginning of the story.
3546;I love this movie and it is one of my all time favorites and as much as I would love to get this new extended edition, it cost too much.
3547;I find this movie to have such delightful acting.
3548;The lines are delivered in such a way that it leaves you feeling the person's joys and sorrows.
3549;I find the visuals to be absolutely stunning and actually wished some moments were covered more.
3550;The movie is an epic and is a definite requirement if you enjoy the Braveheart type of movie.
3551;The writing in this movie I found to be very memorable and quotable.
3552;This is without a doubt one of Scott's best films.
3553;Crowe is a born star, and the cinematography is outstanding.
3554;The only historical film I enjoyed more than this is Braveheart.
3555;This is a very entertaining movie.
3556;It's all right, but certainly not the great cinematic work it's being touted as.
3557;The music in itself was very nice, but the viewer gets beat over the head with the choir of angels bit.
3558;, I was waiting for him to say, That's it!
3559;This is a terrific film in the spirt of Spartacus and Ben Hur.
3560;The characters are terrific and the script is top notch.
3561;This is a wonderful movie that is definately headed for the oscars.
3562;The acting is excellent, the plot and story is breathtaking, the scenery and just the way it was made was something that you just can not miss.
3563;I write this some time after seeing the film and still recall its impact.
3564;Crow's performance carried emotion through the film and he looked good and tough in it.
3565;Offhand, I loved the line the emperor screamed .
3566;And, I love that fact it had a good ending.
3567;Despite the fact that this movie takes a lot of it's cues from movies like Spartacus , Ben Hur , Fall of the Roman Empire , Rocky , and other hero/war/Roman movies there's something about it that made it into the movie that it is, a completely captivating, intriguing, emotionally draining, and fun epic.
3568;the acting is superb, Crowe just eminates suffering talented guy and although he does nothing totally mindboggling he really does an overall fantastic job, better than any other this year.
3569;But the biggest surprise is Joaquin Phoenix.
3570;He's good everyone, and he makes you love him and really, really hate him.
3571;Then there are the supporting characters that make this such an ensemble piece, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, they all do their part and make is superb.
3572;the cinematography is good
3573;there are aspects of this movie that are new to the movie scene, such as some of the themes, acting styles, and plot twists, and overall it has this power to it that nearly blows you away.
3574;Bring a box of kleenex (honestly, seeing Russell Crowe WEEPING is enough to bring anyone to tears).
3575;other than I'd say Traffic this movie is the best of the year!
3576;In a world of film that suffers an astonishing paucity of good material, GLADIATOR is a pleasant relief.
3577;Hollywood has long needed more true Heroes, and this delivers in great fashion.
3578;fashioned epic, along the lines of BEN.
3579;A rousing story, gripping action scenes, breathtaking sets, and aptly mournful music .
3580;combine to make GLADIATOR one of the best movies of the decade (if not, as in my own opinion, one of the best of all time!)
3581;This heartbreaking epic will take you through a range of emotions.
3582;From the glorious panoramas of Rome, the bloodiness of battle, and the heartwarming feelings of devotion a man has towards his family and country.
3583;Stand up and cheer for this Gladiator!
3584;This movie is wonderful and informative too!
3585;I am a 15 year old and feel this is a great movie while being informative at the same time.
3586;Be sure to share this wonderful work with your child as my father did with me!
3587;The film itself is a fantastic production, well acted and produced, and serves up healthy portions of action and politcal intrigue.
3588;down, one of the best films to come out of Dreamworks.
3589;I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler.
3590;The new age of the ancient world in film arises under the vision of Ridley Scott and presents us with the Oscar winning star making performance by Russell Crowe.
3591;See as superb examples of this real time expensive film style illustrated in Cleopatra 1963 or The Fall of the Roman Empire 1964 (Which has many parallels to Gladiator).
3592;But today we can revisit this old genre and make it exciting and new with our technological advancements in film.
3593;scott and his collaborators have given new life and spawned a new generation of epic such as the upcoming Troy and Alexander with this impressive and exciting film.
3594;but for the first time viewer there awaits the visceral impact of Russell Crowe's creation of Maximus.
3595;Truly a star turn that few actors of his generation could achieve.
3596;He fills the screen, the film, the very era with authority, strength, and even tenderness and proves here that there is nothing this fine talent cannot do.
3597;scott has surrounded his star with stellar supporting performers who add to the film with talent and in some cases just the right touch of humor.
3598;the music by Hans Zimmer, which by now is much imitated in TV miniseries of late, recalls the greatness of Rozsa and Alex North and adds dimension and scope to the picture.
3599;Gladiator is a supreme effort and well deserving of it's many laurels.
3600;Gladiator has all the makings of an extraordinarily entertaining film: intense action, thrilling sound track, solid acting, and, of course, Russell Crowe.
3601;Ridley Scott put together an awe.
3602;inspiring film of epic proportions.
3603;The recreated Rome is stunning, especially the Coliseum.
3604;But no worries
3605;russell Crowe puts in a great performance, and he handles the action sequence with the same ease as he handles the dramatic sequences (Anyone who's seen The Insider knows this man can act).
3606;knowns Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix put in solid performances as well.
3607;It's meant to excite, and it does that extremely well.
3608;Thankfully, the remastered version 2 restores all the film grain, grit and detail to Ridley Scott's seminal masterpiece.
3609;The movie itself features great performances from the whole cast inlcluding the late Oliver Reed who died in Italy right as this was being finished.
3610;The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.
3611;He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.
3612;Still the movie captures his evil nature very well as does the actor who protays him, and it presents a story about revenge.
3613;This is a good movie in spite of this historical misstep.
3614;Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being.
3615;besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.
3616;the special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome.
3617;notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.
3618;Wonderful action, great characters, perfect musical score, what else do we need?
3619;Sure, this isn't exactly the most historically accurate movie ever made, but it IS a wonderful bit of fiction, sure to satisfy the most hardened action lover, with enough intrigue and romance to fill the needs of others, too.
3620;This is what epic Roman stories SHOULD be like.
3621;See the list of awards it won?
3622;This is a great movie with plenty of action.
3623;Russell Crowe is just out standing in this movie and I think it is one of his best.
3624;This is not the greatest movie ever made, nor is it anywhere up there with a movie of the year!
3625;i loved the first battle scene.
3626;It was beautiful, despite the death and destruction taking place.
3627;dive through the rest of the film.
3628;I love a good villian I can't stand.
3629;Russel Crowe's intense emotional potrayal of Maximus is worthy of 5 stars alone!
3630;Product game quick and at a great price.
3631;This is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
3632;Russel Crowe definitely earned his Best Actor award in this movie.
3633;Joaquin Phoenix is also excellent in this movie, his performance was underrated.
3634;The story itself is moving and gripping, you actually feel something for the characters.
3635;It is clearly stated at the end of the movie that it is based on events in history that have been altered, and it is a work of fiction.
3636;ther story itself does not drag, and is very moving.
3637;Ridley Scott once again directs a maserpiece.
3638;the acting is great, and this can definitely be the movie that made Russel Crowe.
3639;Joaquin Phoenix also gave a memorable performance, and it was very disappointing not to see him win the award for best supporting actor.
3640;This is a sand and sandals gladiator epic with flair and intrigue.
3641;so but the acting in support, the grand cinematography, the totally enveloping big sound and the magnificent battle staging, along with great computer special effects, all combine to make this one of the best action movies of the year!
3642;Crowe is quite good as Maximus but I feel he was better in L. a. Confidential a few years ago.
3643;It is true here that the star brings the masses in but the villain actually makes the movie work as entertaining art.
3644;Oliver Reed as the cynical former gladiator who saves Maximus for the battle pits is convincingly world.
3645;Finally, Crowe's adoring gladiator buddies provide excellent redemptive backup for him at the proper times later in the picture.
3646;It took a second and even a third viewing on my home theater screen to really appreciate the fine work and detail that went into making this a superior entertainment.
3647;In many ways this picture is better made and has more to say about life, love and honor than even that old classic.
3648;This is enjoyable escapist fare and comes highly recommended!
3649;Good entertainment, if you have nothing better to do.
3650;That's about it, in a nutshell.
3651;Better than DJango, that's for sure!
3652;Personally I liked that film .
3653;it looks good on the screen to see the Roman infantry trot up to their enemies in close formation and take cover behind their shields when the barbarians fired a volley of arrows.
3654;Not so in ancient Rome: many gladiators were actually free born people from all walks of life .
3655;Only an extremely rich patron could actually afford to pay the rates for mortal encounters.
3656;His generals performed brilliantly and even invaded Iraqi territory.
3657;But among the trophies they also brought back the small pox.
3658;that the emperor was assassinated is Hollywood's favorite myth.
3659;A great tragic story of a Roman nobleman turned gladiator.
3660;The critics lovd it, and almost everyone who went to see it at the movie theater i worked at did as well: even I enjoyed it!
3661;Gladiator was a film that actually took the heroic plot and turned it into a grand epic, that I would have to compare to my movie going experience when I saw Titanic in December of 1997.
3662;The shots at times cut short and seem to be filmed on separate kinds of filmstock, but the cinematography is much better than what John Woo did on MI2.
3663;Even though Maximus is a heroic general and all, be responsible with what your children view.
3664;I love Russell Crowe and think this is one GREAT movie!
3665;My favorite movie line ever.
3666;And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
3667;I ordered this for my boyfriend and he loves it.
3668;I like it so I bought it.
3669;It was the era when the screen was lit up with lavish epic.
3670;Now Hollywood is going all out in, what they hope will be, the new golden age of cinema complete with lavish three hour epic.
3671;the story center on a man who was once in the service of a vast ancient empire commanding troops in grand feats of battle but now serves merely as entertainment in the gladiatorial events fighting for his life.
3672;Maximus Decimus Meridius was one of the greatest generals the Roman Empire had ever seen in that he courageously fought in battle, won the field when he was commanded to do so, and retained the loyalty and devotion of his troops.
3673;The story for Gladiator, though marred with numerous historical inaccuracies, is quite honestly one of the most entertaining and visually engaging epic.
3674;gladiator is one of the rare shining example for the rest of Hollywood .
3675;The role of Maximus Decimus Meridius is quite possibly Russell Crowe's most commanding performance to date, with the only exception being his role as Captain Jack Aubrey in the naval drama, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.
3676;He successfully transitions his character from a dynamic general in the beginning of the film to a barbaric gladiator by the mid.
3677;way point of the film, and yet at the same time he maintains some of those leadership qualities that made the character so enduring to begin with.
3678;Another relatively unknown, at the time of this film's release, actor who manages to light up the screen was Joaquin Phoenix with his exuberant and often disturbing performance as the Emperor Commodus.
3679;Visually, and emotionally, this film is nearly perfect with Ridley Scott's direction taking the ancient world of Rome and presenting to the movie.
3680;But taking the film, despite all of that, for what it is, Gladiator is one of the most enthralling and emotionally compelling dramas of 2000, though not at quite the level of being the best picture of the year.
3681;Russell Crowe brings something indescribable to this movie.
3682;this is a story set in the grandeur of ancient Rome.
3683;the ending of the movie is bittersweet.
3684;But this movie is definitely a great one.
3685;ray from my local video store and while Braveheart received top notch treatment in its transfer to Blu.
3686;The film looks a tad bit to bright at times.
3687;I further noticed flashes of unnatural color here and there in the film.
3688;Gladiator is a film deserving of a dynamic visual presentation in High Definition.
3689;It deserves better than this release.
3690;This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer.
3691;It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix.
3692;One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles.
3693;This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination.
3694;His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus.
3695;Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L. a. Confidential.
3696;His performance is brutal and intense.
3697;I am a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude.
3698;His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner, Legend and Alien.
3699;pleasing, entertaining, its got Russell Crowe, CGI tigers, swords, lots and lots of action and a suitable running time for a battle epic.
3700;I enjoyed Gladiator even since it came out.
3701;I thought it was clever and enthralling entertainment that kept me captivated with its ferocious and heartfelt story.
3702;on the subject of the story, Gladiator really does have a lot going for it.
3703;It may not look a lot on the outside, but look for Gladiator's interior and you will see there is actually quite a lot going on the film.
3704;plots which bring across the messages of family love, revenge, jealousy, history, friendship, death, war and terrific conquests.
3705;I was constantly surprised at how much I was learning from Gladiator, even if it did have some historical inaccuracies.
3706;to bring to life all these stories we needed a great director, someone who used his/her vision to bring such a highly anticipated cinema event to life.
3707;Scott puts all his heart and soul into the film and it finally emerges as one of his most enjoyable and entertaining and overall best achievements to date.
3708;scott's cast also does extremely well in delivering the goods.
3709;Crowe brings such a manly, strong and enjoyable hero to watch you literally have to choke back the urge to cheer for his character.
3710;Joaquin Phoenix is the villain in the film, he brings an eerie screen presence, and he is finally matching up to the standards of his late brother, River.
3711;Connie Neilsen is the main lady in the film, and struts through the movie with a great elegance.
3712;Neilsen carries herself excellently, and she proves that she can do better than just an extended cameo (The Devil's Advocate).
3713;Oliver Reed is also particularly enjoyable, as is Amistad's Djimoun Hounson, and Richard Harris is perfect in the very small but largely important role of Marcus Aurelius.
3714;the movie looks great, too.
3715;The battle scenes are gory and the incredible sound techniques used in them are eye widening.
3716;The costumes are beautiful and have a lot of range, Janty Yates did do a good job, but the armour and most of the costume designs weren't actually made in the times when this film is set.
3717;Never mind, they look good and suit the cast, and at the end of the day that's what matters.
3718;Stunning!The length and pace of the film suited me fine.
3719;Even though it is over 2 hours, Gladiator actually never really bored me or had me uninterested, so I was fine with the couple of hours well spent in the cinema.
3720;i really liked the way the movie begun and ended.
3721;This movie is very well done and never goes over the boat with cheesiness.
3722;gladiator is a film you'll love or hate.
3723;I loved it a lot, it's a movie that has the power to entertain you with action, stun you with thrills, take your breath away with some amazing atmospheric special effect places, and definitely make you feel a lot for the people in the movie.
3724;I highly recommend this to not only action gurus and Russell Crowe fans, but I think everyone will find something they like in Gladiator.
3725;I give it 5 stars because I do like the film.
3726;And Russel Crowe is a good actor, but is he really the star everyone is gushing over.
3727;Just a bunch of well acted fighting, and in the end it's over for him as well as Commodus.
3728;Some powerfull scenes with his father , good long scenes with his sister , really show what a coward Commodus was.
3729;I thought this was great acting, even though Crowe is the listed star, In my opinion, it's Phoenix's character that really draws out some fine drama, and powerfull acting.
3730;I never thought I'd see a movie as good as Braveheart.
3731;But Gladiator is just as good if not better.
3732;I sat on the edge of my seat throughout.
3733;My girlfriend liked the movie, however, not as much as me.
3734;this movie is well worth the price.
3735;If you can stomach the gore, give it a chance.
3736;It is a great story starring Russell Crowe, the premier hero, and Joaquin Phoenix, the main villain.
3737;When you see what happens to our protagonist's family, what he loves most, you will be intensely wishing for justice.
3738;And justice is served, however bittersweet it may be.
3739;This is the best movie involving the Roman Empire that I have ever seen.
3740;Commodus has reinstated the gladiatorial matches at the Colosseum.
3741;owner gives this advice to Maximus, a gladiator intended for the ring of battle: I was the best because the crowd loved me
3742;He's talking of the power of spectacle, as a means to an end (i. e., Maximus' freedom).
3743;It is easy to see how this applied to not only the Gladiators of ancient Rome, but its politicians as well
3744;substance approach of modern political campaigning.
3745;Kind of a gutsy move, biting the hand that feeds and feeds and feeds you.
3746;From the opening bloodbath in Germania (Unleash Hell, Maximus says, coolly), to the multiple battles in the Colosseum, director Ridley Scott handles the action with great style.
3747;The sheer size of these battles is impressive enough, and the action does its very best to measure up.
3748;But what summer blockbuster even gets this close to the Bard?
3749;All of the actors make the best of what they're given.
3750;Connie Nielsen as said sister is cunning and thoughtful as the daughter who, if she'd have been born a son, would have made a fine leader.
3751;Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and even Derek Jacobi show up in small, but pivotal roles, lending authority to the proceedings.
3752;I am ever amazed at the amount of visceral intensity this man burns on screen.
3753;Who has his combination of physical power and grace, charisma, and quiet dignity?
3754;It would definitely be a fitting end to a fine piece of entertainment such as this.
3755;You are not going to learn a lot about history by watching this movie but I found it very entertaining.
3756;Unlike one of the other reviews, I thought it had a great ending.
3757;I put it in the same class as Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan which were both great movies.
3758;All the colors and clarity are there.
3759;It's even standard AND extended version as it gives you a choice of which one you want to watch.
3760;The movie itself is great as we all know and now the blu.
3761;Best movie of 2000 and more.
3762;This is unforgettable journey to the Ancient Civilization of Roman Empire, world`s most advanced city of that time .
3763;Perfect actor skills of Russell Crowe make a special atmosphere of a strong and wise hero, whose family was murdered, but he will have his revenge.
3764;Gladiator was a spectacle that kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time in the movie theater.
3765;This movie brought back a sense that Rome is still around.
3766;Rome is the light, and will be forever.
3767;this movie is worth more than 5 stars.
3768;I can't write more than 20 words, but I can tell that Gladiator is one of the best (excellent) movie made lately.
3769;I have tape (VHS) and watch it once weekly.
3770;art digital technology, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us the return of the glorious city that was Rome.
3771;But his ambitious son, decided not to fulfill his father's will, will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire.
3772;the epic cinema returned big.
3773;Reliving all the pomp and ceremony of old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle you with extraordinary battles, realistic scenes of fight and admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.
3774;russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator
3775;His Maximus is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.
3776;the rest of the cast is magnificent, from the selection of Joaquim Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy are concrete, to Richard Harris in its small but impressive Marcus Aurelius.
3777;under the skillful direction of Ridley Scott .
3778;who brings out the best from the script supported by a range of technological tools.
3779;Gladiator succeeds finding a perfect balance between action and emotion.
3780;Its main center is in the characters and in a history that captures the importance of our actions.
3781;Their protagonists emit vitality, in the battlefield, in the bloody sand and mainly, they convince us that it's worth to live or die by the values and ideals we have inside.
3782;Thank you Amazon for shipping the right edition of the movie.
3783;I received the product exactly in time, I was so happy.
3784;It was a present and the person really like it.
3785;i'm satisfied with the product.
3786;this movie was truly gr8 i loved it and i am sure yall will 2 the plot, acting, and story was touching.
3787;a movie that will keep you off the seat trust me get it u wont be sorry
3788;don't worry this all happens in the first 15 minutes so I am not ruining anything!This movie is full of suspense, action, gore (uggg, they could have left that out) but I loved it, I really did!
3789;The actors did an amazing job!
3790;she pretty much hit the nail on the head.
3791;the GOOD PARTS OF THE FILM WERE:(1) wonderful colosseum fights
3792;
3793;while I don't feel this deserved best film, Hollywood has always had a soft spot for big epic pieces (look at TITANIC).
3794;What I found was a masterpiece.
3795;The actors were perfectly casted.
3796;The acting was some of the most memorable in many years.
3797;The special effects were amazing.
3798;The battles were incredibly realistic and beleivable.
3799;Russell Crowe(Maximus) was perfect at playing his role
3800;Throughout the movie you are made to believe that all he is trying to do is win his freedom.
3801;By the end he finally wins his freedom.
3802;i wont ruin the surprise ending for you.
3803;I will say that it is deliciously ironic though.
3804;That being said I think that Ridley Scott is a genius and that this is by far his best film.
3805;In scope alone it leaves an impression.
3806;Everything else about this film is perfect from the sets and costumes to the academy award winning performance that Russell Crowe gave as Maximus.
3807;Overall this film is one of my favorites and definitley worth watching.
3808;ridley Scott's Gladiator is an amazing film.
3809;For 2 1/2 hours I was glued to the screen and loving every minute of it.
3810;Everything about this film was extremely well done.
3811;The story was extremely inspiring because of what Maximus is forced to go through.
3812;The musical score to this film was amazing.
3813;It was extremely powerful and moving.
3814;Each time that it played throughout the film, the intensity of the scene would increase.
3815;I also thought that Ridley Scott did an excellent job at recreating the Colliseum and ancient Rome in general.
3816;Rusell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were both amazing in their roles and played extremely well off of each other.
3817;Their feud was extremely entertaining throughout the whole film.
3818;Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, and Djimon Hounsou were all fantastic in their roles as well.
3819;overall, Gladiator is a great film.
3820;The story is inspiring, all the actors involved did a great job, the musical score was very powerful, and the film effectively recreated ancient Rome.
3821;If you have surround sound, you will love watching this film when using it.
3822;One of the top 5 films of all.
3823;If there were a way to write a more entertaining, awesome story, with better acting, choreography, etc.
3824;This was a well done film.
3825;I really enjoyed the history of the movie.
3826;After watching it, I researched a lot of the names and more of the background of that time period.
3827;When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was hooked.
3828;When I saw it I thought it was a very good movie probably the best epic I have seen in a long time.
3829;The story was great and so was the acting.
3830;There was edge of your seat thrills and a tragic end but overall this movie tops my list of being the best movie this year.
3831;mY REVIEW: This movie is powerful and emotional, is action packed, and is a true epic with great story telling.
3832;This is a real career turn.
3833;GLADIATOR won BEST PICTURE of 2000, and it deserves it!
3834;The movie has great special effects (which it won an Academy Award for)and marvelous battles!
3835;The music is the best part!
3836;Hans Zimmer is top notch at his music which really sets the tone for this film!
3837;This movie deserves far more than all five stars!
3838;See GLADIATOR, as being the BEST MOVIE of 2000!
3839;Films don't usually get this good!
3840;We finall have a BEST PICTURE that is worthy of the oscar!
3841;The entire film is breath taking.
3842;Everything from the scenery, acting, fighting, special effects, are just superb!!
3843;It's just a pleasure to watch.
3844;Besides the great fight scenes there is a more telling story of a man living/fighting for his family.
3845;This is also a story about the power of love courage.
3846;I know it's a great movie and everyone loves it.
3847;i hope they will release a new edition with double.
3848;Ridley Scott is one of the most visually prolific directors ever.
3849;His films Alien and Blade Runner alone are testaments to his talents, though the Roman epic Gladiator is one of his best, resurrecting Rome but at the same time delivering a classic Shakesperian story ripe with feeling and authenticity.
3850;He employs an extraordinary cast, which include Russel Crowe who won an Academy Award for his portrayal as the fallen general Maximus.
3851;budgets are routinely given out these days, Gladiator lives up to its epic title by being granted a $100 million.
3852;sized, resurrecting the landmark Roman Coliseium in all its glory.
3853;The costume and set designs are exquisitely detailed, down to the last thread of silk on Connie Nielsons' gowns.
3854;Now, everyone is entitled to their own opinion (with the internet you can just about read everyone's anyway) but I see Gladiator as a triumph as a modern.
3855;It brims with equal parts visual splendor and genuine emotion, carried by restrained but stylistic direction and wondrous acting.
3856;It succeeds at being both a feast for the eyes and as grand storytelling.
3857;Gladiator was the first in a series of recent successful Russell Crowe movies, and I think he started on not so bad a foot.
3858;'Gladiator' is an outstanding film in its own right.
3859;The set pieces, the battle in Germania, all the fights in the arena are extremely well done and realistic.
3860;The attention to detail was amazing.
3861;A simple story really, but Crowe as Maximus gives the character a lot of depth and I found his character inspiring.
3862;A man like Maximus inspires others to great things and helps raise them up.
3863;Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as the evil Commodus.
3864;Oliver Reed is great in his last performance, and the actor who plays Maximus' African friend (can't recall his name) ads a poignant touch (I especially liked his last scene in the Coliseum at the end, when he buries the dolls of Maximus' family in the earth of the Coliseum).
3865;scenes like that, and others
3866;Great Battle scene in the beginning, good drama, good villian.
3867;The ending is a little goofy, and not at all factual, but overall a fun and entertaining epic.
3868;I'm not the type of person to enjoy macho movies like Gladiator and The Patriot, but I immensely enjoyed both of them.
3869;Maybe my head has been in the sand, but I didn't really know who Russell Crowe was (excluding his romance with Meg Ryan) but now find myself a true fan.
3870;His acting is extraordinary and the story line allows us to look a little bit into the past.
3871;more than the movie, the bonus material is fantastic.
3872;if you like suspense and drama, Gladiator is for you!
3873;This is definately worth the upgrade!
3874;Great movie with great story, brilliant actors, spectacular extras, good new scenes .
3875;Your best bet is to go with the one disc special edition.
3876;But I do really like his work in this movie (among countless others!)
3877;no other film of the Roman Epic class will ever compare to the beauty and splendor that is found in Gladiator.
3878;Russell Crowe is one of the few leading men who truely fits the Strong Silent role perfectly, while horribly tradgic, the movie astounds me every time I watch it.
3879;Love it's actors, style, music.
3880;But, that's a given considering the subject.
3881;Russell Crowe's charactor is a amazingly brave man that you what to see win.
3882;A great exit role for Richard Harris.
3883;Russel Crowe is brilliant and the CG is unbelievable.
3884;This has to be one of the best movies ever created.
3885;I can watch this movie on repeat.
3886;I bought this from my son's Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy with the gift wrap I ordered.
3887;It looked very classy, and my son was very pleased!
3888;Oh it looks wonderful, the fight scenes are great but, and I know it's not just me who thinks this, the whole enterprise isn't very involving.
3889;You get the sense that film makers believe that the Roman Empire was a noble enterprise.
3890;however, this is a Ridley Scott film and of course it's very well made.
3891;The fights are great and all the acting is fine.
3892;Every summer there's at least one blockbuster movie.
3893;Using state of the art computer graphics you'll believe that you're actually seeing ancient Rome and this is definitely a highly cinematic film that loses something on video.
3894;the acting is fantastic as well.
3895;As loner Maximus he is perfectly cast and manages to bring to his character what is perhaps left out in the script.
3896;As the villainous emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is genuinely creepy and actually quite unconventional as well.
3897;Over anything else this is a blockbuster and as such can't be viewed as anything truly revelatory.
3898;Yet viewed simply as a movie it is a stunning breakthrough: utterly breathtaking and compelling in equal measure.
3899;where to be seen!A visual treat and wonderful acting by all characters.
3900;The wonderfully evil Commodus, and the troubled but vengeful Maximus contrast beautifully.
3901;overs, the Imperial palace is luxurious and splendid, and the colosseum is incredible.
3902;a tad too long perhaps, but a film worth seeing no doubt.
3903;This is a Hollywood movie for sure!
3904;I usually don't care for some of these kinds of films as they seem to get a little tedious, but this film is very engrossing and filled with great action.
3905;Crowe proves himself to be one of the finest actors today.
3906;I'm a big fan of Richard Harris after his Oscar worthy performance in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and he adds credibility to this picture.
3907;The first twenty minutes of this film earn it its one star.
3908;Beautifully directed, great story and wonderfully casted.
3909;And the fantastic sound did take my breath away.
3910;This is a good movie to own.
3911;This was a great all around film with excellent direction, acting, and scenery.
3912;The Majesticness of the Roman empire was captured nicely and the power of it's people and culture were also well rendered.
3913;I even brought my girlfriend at the time to see it, and we talked about it nonstop.
3914;It is rare for this type of movie to be embraced by females, maybe it was Russell Crowe?
3915;Who knows, regardless this movie was a masterpiece.
3916;Absolutely perfect from start to finish.
3917;well, my brother happens to be a big fan of this movie as well and has a Blue Ray player.
3918;So he invited me over so we can catch up and watch this movie on Blue Ray.
3919;It is nice to have this movie on my Kindle.
3920;I would highly recommend it for your Kindle.
3921;An epic in the true sense with a great hero and a great villain.
3922;This is a huge movie that has everything right.
3923;A visually spectacular experience supported by an equally stunning sound track.
3924;Because he wants to give power back to the people.
3925;Anyone who knows anything about Roman history ought to be ashamed for swallowing this whopper.
3926;The hero's family is murdered, and so our hero must rise up against seemingly unstoppable forces to get revenge.
3927;Sound familiar?I can agree that Russell Crowe is a fine actor, as are the other players in this film.
3928;even still, lots of folks out there liked it, so I guess its just a matter of taste.
3929;Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, but the film has an overly weedy villain who lets the film down.
3930;I have no doubt that most people will enjoy this and for good reason: Fantastic battle set.
3931;pieces, Exciting, it doesn't really seem three hours long, stunning backdrops and realistic locations, Great performance by Crowe, probably deserving the Best Actor he received, So enjoy but don't expect much more than a fantastic three hours fun with little to think about.
3932;Gladiator is the world's GREATEST movie ever made!
3933;A smart move I must say.
3934;I write this 4 days after the Oscar nominations.
3935;Great film, the box office hit Russell needed.
3936;There's so many education clips after you watch the movie on the Extra Disc which I found very fascinating.
3937;Since this is my favorite movie of all time it could only be good, what was especially so was the fact that you got both theatrical and extended version.
3938;this is a crime to such a wonderful movie.
3939;Im a huge Russell Crowe fan!
3940;I also like a beautiful mind.
3941;Interesting tale of honor and respect between the emporer and his general, the general and his troops.
3942;Maximus was the valiant soldier, loved by his men.
3943;i loved this for many reasons (not only the parallel to the 2000 election which was unfolding at the time).
3944;and make the crowd love you ).
3945;the crowd loves this movie.
3946;It is rich in history and an addictive plot to follow.
3947;I watched this movie long ago and have to watch it again for a class that my son is taking in HS.
3948;Hey if you love action movies here is one right here!
3949;It's got people fighting to fighting tigers!
3950;My family loves this movie.
3951;It has it all
3952;But this one, is the top of the pile.
3953;Russelll Crowe is excellent as Maximus.
3954;He is physical enough to be believable.
3955;The special effects rival any of George Lucas film.
3956;the level of attention to detail is amazing.
3957;And the special second disk in the set has several very interesting documentaries.
3958;Excellent film with an excellent cast.
3959;the acting is superb not to mention the costumes.
3960;the story of course is of a gladiator,his love,his loyalty.
3961;Once again Ridley Scott, one of the best directors in modern cinema, resurrects an old and trite genre.
3962;He did for Roman epics, what Alien and Blade Runner did for their respective genres.
3963;In this movie, he brings the fanatic and edge of your seat excitement that Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart had to the epic roman battles.
3964;This film had it all, from a great cast to wonderful cinematography and editing.
3965;climactic ending, but I heard that it was due to some storm that destroyed the sets for the grand epic battle.
3966;I wonder if they will shed more light on that subject, but still it was a great movie.
3967;It made a star out of Russell Crowe, a great actor who has been in some very good movies, among my favorite, is LA Confidential.
3968;Director Ridley Scott brings the heat of the battle arena into your home with this action packed movie based on the fictitious life of a gladiator.
3969;winning actor Russell Crowe plays the leading role in this movie as Maximus, a Roman general turned gladiator.
3970;The story is well paced and engrossing.
3971;It brings out the best in my equipment, which also makes me smile.
3972;Gladiator is Ridley Scott's very successful attempt at portraying the life of of a gladiator.
3973;It is definitely one of my top ten favorite films, because of its excellent character development, excellent storyline, and excellent portrayal of the time period and of the life gladiators lived.
3974;the rest of the movie portrays Maximus the gladiator struggling to stay alive as he battles professional fighters, barbarian hordes, and tigers, determined to win his freedom.
3975;The excellent character development, plot construction, and choreography makes it one of the best films ever made (in my opinion).
3976;This movie is simply excellent!
3977;The box set is great too, but I only recommend spending the extra loot ifyou're already a fan of the flick.
3978;Gladiator is one of the greatest action movies of all time.
3979;the acting is incredible, and received multiple Academy Awards.
3980;Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are absolutely amazing.
3981;From general to slave to gladiator, all on a great revenge plot.
3982;perfect movies, you must watch Gladiator.
3983;I received my copy and I am happy to say that I have the remastered copy with the issues from the old version resolved.
3984;I Loved this movie the first time I saw it.
3985;, that is one of the reasons I liked it.
3986;Gladiator really shows how well Ridley Scott can direct and how well Russell Crowe can act.
3987;It's really easy to feel attached to the lift of this gladiator and what he has to go through after becoming a slave.
3988;Thoroughly entertaining, exciting historical epic with great special effects, production values and especially wonderful performances from Crowe, Reed and Nielsen.
3989;Obvious care and affection went into even the smallest details and it shows with a moving and emotional story.
3990;A winner on every level!
3991;Terrific acting, awesome action, impressive cinematography, hauntingly beautiful music, and perfect casting.
3992;I rank this movie among the greatest epic movies ever made such as Ben.
3993;The reviews were uniformly good, friends who had seen it rated it a solid thumbs up, and I'm a huge Russell Crowe fan, so I settled in with my popcorn, ready to enjoy.
3994;Visually, it's a very striking film, although at times Ridley Scott lays on the effects a little too thick.
3995;The performances, most notably by Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, are good, although Connie Nielsen's presence in this otherwise male.
3996;But what keeps this in my mind from becoming the masterpiece some claim is the screenplay.
3997;Crowe looks tremendous in a breastplate and tunic, by the way.
3998;handed historical drama that came out in a kind of a down year for good films.
3999;Crowe makes this film a real triumph and the action.
4000;Loved the Hans film score and the computer look of Rome was great.
4001;One of Russel Crow's best performances.
4002;A movie that can be watched many times and still enjoyed
4003;I'll be honest, at the cinemas I avoided watching this film when it was first released because I am not into historic epical films.
4004;Russel Crowe in one of his best performances.
4005;I was surprised at the less talk and more action in this film, a lot of edge of seat fights and great performances all round.
4006;It is my best film of the year 2000.
4007;But what really surprised me about this movie was the way it pulled me in and made me feel,mainly due to the very crafty way in which the scenes were composed, and of course, the talent of the main actor.
4008;It is well worth the 3 hours it takes to watch this movie.
4009;And Mr. Phoenix cries, weeps and sobs with impressive femininity.
4010;Its a really good movie!
4011;The special bonus features are very interesting.
4012;The Gladiator is a story of a true hero.
4013;A movie with stunning visuals and great action scenes.
4014;Apart from the great effects and visuals, and well.
4015;dimensional dialogue keeps happening over and over.
4016;Crowe's glottal delivery is strangely reminiscent of the manic.
4017;'The interaction between Crowe and the princess is so hammy one's fast.
4018;clad guard comes stomping in so that there is something interesting to watch.
4019;I'll let you in on a secret: Rome still bit the dust.
4020;The Germanic tribes that got housed in the first scenes .
4021;they won in the end.
4022;Director Ridley Scott triumphs again in this modern EPIC.
4023;From the openning battle in Germania to the final dual between Maximus(Crowe) and Commodus(Phoenix) in the Coliseum, this movie is an audio and visual feast on a grand scale.
4024;Gladiator is a perfect example.
4025;other Ridley Scott films I recommend: ALIEN, Blade Runner, Black Rain.
4026;It has it all, great acting, great plot, great action, and a great soundtrack.
4027;Nice movie and great actor!
4028;With this film Russell Crowe cements his place amongst the elite of the world's top actors, a group he was on the verge on joining after stellar performances in LA Confidential and others.
4029;Director Ridley Scott is a sure hand on the tiller, delivering the years most magnificent spectacle.
4030;The multinational cast deliver superior performances, including a final swansong from Oliver Reed.
4031;Commodus was shocked to find Maximus still alive.
4032;disc set, one containing the nearly three.
4033;one for the movie itself, one for the creation of the music, and more.
4034;Both are epic in scope, both center on one man's quest for vengeance at the dawning of a new era, both are beautifully directed.
4035;and both films contain some of the most outstanding battle scenes ever shot.
4036;Gladiator's opening battle is perhaps the best I have ever seen.
4037;Respect Ridley Scott for what he has done with Gladiator.
4038;The first ten minutes of the film are possibly the most awe.
4039;inspiring in any film (barring Star Wars), and this stream of adrenaline pumping action continues throughout the film.
4040;And that's the good bit of the film.
4041;And that is what I think of the film.
4042;When it's good, it's the best action 'done in the old style' film in a long time, but when it starts to believe it has a well crafted, engaging story, it just becomes rather too Hollywood.
4043;Russell Crowe definately deserved the Oscar for this wonderful film.
4044;He was certainly convincing as a gladiator on the warpath after his wife and son are killed on orders from the ruthless Commodus.
4045;This movie has you on edge from beginning to end especially during the many fight scenes.
4046;Its very acurate at showing Rome at its peak, it has awesome fight/battle scenes, and shows that everything in the Gladiator games does inspire modern sports entertainment like pro wrestling.
4047;This item was a father's day gift, I looked all over for it and only found it on Amazon at a great price, the shipping was super fast and my husband enjoyed the gift!
4048;I went abroad and after seeing what's left of the amazing colosseum I wanted to experience once again through the eyes of Hollywood.
4049;Gladiator does a good and mostly accurate job of bringing it all back to life
4050;Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie.
4051;It was so beautifully filmed and acted.
4052;Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed.
4053;Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!)
4054;This is a great movie about battle, courage, and honor.
4055;It incorporates both tremendous victory and dire loss.
4056;Russell Crowe does a fabulous job portraying a Roman gladiator and a husband/father who wants nothing more than to return home to his family.
4057;The film work and special effects are great and the acting is spectacular.
4058;With an R rating, this movie is obviously not OK for kids, but for adult, my husband and I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up!
4059;cast and in excellent form as the Roman legionnaire general Maximus, a well.
4060;Maximus is not only a great commander, but is loved and respected by his soldiers, and deeply trusted by Aurelius.
4061;Although the ending takes some liberties with history, it is nevertheless a quite fitting conclusion to what is essentially a morality play.
4062;ray edition the next day.
4063;this movie is about honor and loyalty.
4064;Two qualities I believe are most important in life.
4065;Violent, moving, and a great story.
4066;One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time.
4067;Ridley Scott basically raped the Roman Empire and put a modern socio.
4068;political spin on a time when there weren't even free elections.
4069;Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction.
4070;this movie brings us back to the old time big screen blockbusters like Ben Hur Spartacus and the Robe.
4071;I have to say, however, that this movie was a brave attempt to make an epic like those of Hollywood's golden age.
4072;my equipment is working fine and is fully compatible.
4073;its success has been cemented by three ingredients: R Scott's director's genius and talent to create worlds , R Crowe's colossal charismatic performance that as magnet glues your eyes to screen whenever he's in frame and CGIs.
4074;All the CGIs prove once more that still (and thank God), movies are held together and brought to fame by actors.
4075;, he's of the new actors whose talent comes from within .
4076;the supporting cast is harmonious as well: especially J Phoenix: although his Commodus is a capricious spiled brat, but watch his royal profile and gait, contempt in cold eyes and hidden fear.
4077;well, the best you can expect from Hollywood.
4078;Pathos is towering to heaven, but still sends shivers down your spine and mist into your eyes.
4079;It's a treasure for your home collection.
4080;pS: My greatest fear now is that R Crowe will squander his newly minted stardom and huge talent on some brain.
4081;and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.
4082;paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.
4083;And Ridley Scott's brilliant skills as a director certainly brought vivid imagery to the pageantries and spectacles of the Roman Empire.
4084;The film is more a historical fantasy epic as opposed to strictly a historical epic.
4085;In the mean time, George III has Washington's entire family executed.
4086;Washington finds refuge in the Americas and returns to London for revenge.
4087;Washington returns to the colonies and announces their independence.
4088;A well developed imperial bureaucracy provided many peoples with prominent positions and considerable influence to keep the imperial institution fixed as a permanent one.
4089;The unpaved dirt roads leading into Rome probably the most amusing.
4090;The battle was well done and most of the armor accurate except for the Praetorian guard who look more like they came from a galaxy far far away than from Imperial Rome.
4091;Russel Crowe fit the role very well as a humble general (those were also very rare in Rome except perhaps for Lucullus and Belisarius.)
4092;The combat scenes were a little too quick in sequence but certainly captured the mood of the fury and excitement the crowds expressed at these spectacles.
4093;The Writer definitely made good use of Roman History.
4094;Thank you for your attention.
4095;The movie was brand new and played like it.
4096;Since i saw this movie, I considered it as the best picture ever.
4097;It drama, actings and music is outstanding.
4098;I think they should make more movies with this kind of power on the story because it shows the crude human nature in a context that move the soul to another level.
4099;I would recomend this presentation and it was a great price!
4100;An excellent movie, an instant classic worthy of the finest blu ray release.
4101;It was amazing how the Colosseum was totally recreated and brought back to life.
4102;The music was excellent, although the battle sequence music both in and outside the arena was derived from the Mars section of Holst's The Planets.
4103;You cannot improve upon perfection, and the musical derivation was a wonderful variation nonetheless.
4104;He so much inhabited the character of Maximus that I dare anyone to see this movie to the end without tears in their eyes.
4105;this is an excellent example of the kind.
4106;the 'epic scale' is more or less achieved, aided considerably by some impressive Computer Graphics, and the action sequences are mostly well done.
4107;I believe he's given finer performances, eg in 'Insider', without winning any awards so i guess it's some kind of poetic justice that he must win it for this.
4108;phoenix Joaquin is more impressive as the villain, even though his character has no shades .
4109;Connie Nelson as his sister Crowe's ex love interest is fair.
4110;most of the support cast do their job well.
4111;the technical aspects of the movie, like cinematography, graphics, etc and the score all quite good.
4112;As the music and movie ran tears brimmed my eyes.
4113;The acting is wonderful and the music blended perfectly.
4114;But believe me this is a splendid movie.
4115;A very nice video/music scene you will like plays Now We Are Free.
4116;The beginning that starts in battle is the way human life starts .
4117;not born free but struggling and requiring courage and dedication and hard work to master and learn.
4118;The film is in the tradition of the Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables with its human suffering, and Audie Murphy's story with its incredible courage in the face of the seemingly unconquerable odds.
4119;It also gives a side of the Ancient Roman army that provides food for thought .
4120;I also like the idea that you need to live in other people's shoes so to speak in order to understand them .
4121;The film was created to make money, not to stimulate our intellect and I understand that and in the end I said to myself, i could see this again, only for the ability of Crowe to convey to us the power of loss and imprisonment and especially for the stunning battles sequences that are exciting.
4122;This is a compelling and often grim tale of love, good v. evil, and politics.
4123;This is good, if painful (the gladiator scenes), entertainment.
4124;I have always loved gladiator films, and it has been a really long time since one came along, so when I found out they were making this particular film with Russell Crowe(sigh!)
4125;and directed by Ridley Scott who is always interesting and many times just a little bit bloody which is perfect for a gladiator film, I was thrilled to bits.
4126;I loved the ash falling like snow.
4127;It added a sense of immediacy and realism that put me back into ancient Rome.
4128;The computer graphics were breathtaking
4129;as for the acting, as much as I love Russell Crowe who always does a good job, and as moved as I was with the knowlege that this was the last we would ever see of the late and talented bad.
4130;What a wonderful job Joachim did!
4131;A true monster, terrifying and yet somehow sympathetic as well.
4132;line I found very touching.
4133;series I, Claudius may enjoy this film.
4134;Plus those of you who have read Colleen McCullough's incredible series of roman books, starting with The First Man in Rome to her most recent, Caesar, will most likely enjoy this movie as well.
4135;You really get yor money's worth with Gladiator !
4136;an epic movie loaded with tons of extras.
4137;disc set features a beautiful widescreen print of one of the most visually stunning films in Hollywood's history.
4138;The images are so crisp and 3.
4139;The DTS sound really delivers.
4140;Crank it up during the intensely thrilling Roman Coliseum battles.
4141;row and center as the heroic Maximus (Russell Crowe) slays both man and beast during some of the most riveting fight scenes ever filmed.
4142;I guarantee you'll cheer Crowe's every move during their imminent showdown.
4143;just as satisfying as the film itself is the second disc which is packed with extras.
4144;documentary, and a pair of behind the scenes featurettes which provide a lot of interesting insight.
4145;Director Scott provides an informative audio commentary which I found to be nearly as good as the movie itself.
4146;It's not often that a film of such epic proportions is packaged so well for the home theatre crowd.
4147;In fact, the extras alone are worth the price of admission.
4148;Highly recommended for action fans.
4149;Five stars all the way!
4150;Without any doubt, Gladiator was the best action film of all.
4151;The story of this movie was extraordinary.
4152;He combined the great feeling of heroism and bravery with goodness.
4153;He was envious of Maximus because people loved him and above all because the Emperor loved Maximus mere than him.
4154;The Emperor was an honest man and he fought for his people.
4155;He was never proud of his son and he paid for it with his live.
4156;this movie is the most realistic historical movie on Romans produced so far.
4157;The computer work on ancient Rome is beautiful and pretty much correct.
4158;The first 10 minutes (battle in Germania) are so real that you feel like you just did a time travel.
4159;The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.
4160;ridley Scott is an absolutely talented director.
4161;He and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man.
4162;One of the best movies of Ridley Scotts since Alien and Blade Runner.
4163;russell Crowe is more than adequate in the role of Maximus, he did a very decent job on his role and he does deserve the BEST ACTOR from those movies awards.
4164;Joaquin Phoenix also did a very outstanding job in his role.
4165;The acting of this movie was flawless and stunning.
4166;Russell Crowe was amazing, unforgettable .
4167;A dynamic movie with a spiritual component.
4168;Gladiator is blessed with fine acting, photography, sets, and costumes.
4169;not to mention the bold score by the always fabulous Hans Zimmer.
4170;Director Ridley Scott knows how to entertain, as he keeps the action scenes exciting but not too gory.
4171;Even the slower parts are showered with tension, a true sign of a great drama.
4172;Simply put, everyone should see this movie.
4173;It's the best movie of 2000, and certainly worth of its five Oscars including Best Picture.
4174;i knew it would capture the Best Picture award in the Oscars, and i was right!
4175;a winner of 5 Academy Awards in cluding Best Picture for 2000, Ridley Scott's Gladiator is truly a masterpiece.
4176;he is obviously very special and loved, because the sickly Emperor Marcus wants Maximus to be the next ruler of Rome.
4177;when he awakens he is a common slave.
4178;Maximus makes friends with the other gladiators and sets out on a personal quest to avange his murdered family.
4179;with beautiful directing, acting, cinematography, special effects, and costume design, Gladiator is truly a winner in all respects .
4180;forever destined to become a classic.
4181;back and my conclusion is simply this: For sheer enjoyment of story.
4182;making these are my favorite 5 movies .
4183;GladiatorIronically, given Russell Crowe's superior performance, it was Lucilla's proclamation of Make us believe it again at movie's end with encompassing music score that garnered most moving moment in my opinion.
4184;She was tired of being strong but this was her finest and strongest hour.
4185;Russell Crowe and this picture deserved their Oscars for this terrific movie.
4186;This was undoubtedly Ridley Scott's best turn as a Director since Alien.
4187;a rare movie gets a great story which includes not only action but love and presents both to good effect.
4188;The set offers many great insights to those of us who need to know how things work.
4189;The extras are excellent though, with pop up facts and a very interesting featurette on Oliver Reed.
4190;The story of being on top of the world and then being reduced through abject treachery to slave and climbing up to get revenge is done to perfection by Mr. Crowe.
4191;The music, scenery, Joaquin Phoenix, editing, are all stunning.
4192;Gladiator is overall a fine film, with good actors, good dialogue, and a nice screenplay.
4193;Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, as always, is excellent.
4194;seen as the struggle of one man, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from Roman general to gladiator and slave, the plot is quite strong and moving, apart from the many excellent action scenes.
4195;Its starting point is a momentous event .
4196;The historical Commodus was a sports fanatic and a superb athlete, who wasn't too bad a gladiator himself.
4197;They did a great job with the entire film.
4198;Overall, the movie is beautifully laid out.
4199;Crowe did the best job of acting since George C. Scott did Patton.
4200;The best acting job of the last 20 years.
4201;I already owned the regular widescreen and I wanted to get the blu.
4202;overall a great product and I highly recommend this movie!
4203;It had one great scene: the chariot battle in the Colleseum.
4204;That's really the only thing worth seeing in this entire film.
4205;and it was all right, if you liked sea.
4206;faring movies with big special effects.'
4207;A film that I believe set ridley scott as the best director of the tewntyith and 21 century.
4208;The revolutionary ways he films the action combined with a true shakespearean style story telling leads to an epic that raised the bar back up again for modern films.
4209;I remember first watching this movie in the cinema, because at that time there were no other movies showing that my friends and I have not watched.
4210;What followed was an amazing cinematic experience like no other, my eyes were glued on the screen at all times and I was literally on the edge of my seat.
4211;This is the story that would resonate in the years to come, the Spartacus and Ben.
4212;and true enough, it took home 5 Academy Awards.
4213;After leading the Roman army to victory in one of the most breath.
4214;Commodus asks Maximus to swear loyalty to him, he doesn't and what follows is a story that is emotional, powerful and compelling at the same time.
4215;strengthening the story in every way possible is a very talented cast, led by none other than Russell the Oscar Crowe.
4216;It seems that every movie he does earns him an Oscar nomination and in this movie, he deservedly won the award.
4217;Casting Crowe at that time was a brilliant decision by the film's director, Ridley Scott because he was relatively unknown, so we don't see Crowe as Maximus.
4218;His portrayal of the man was exceptional, every tear, every stare, every move speaks volumes.
4219;This was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time.
4220;Of course, the rest of the cast are no less impressive.
4221;He has felt vulnerable and not loved his whole life.
4222;With a supporting cast that includes Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, you expect nothing but the best, and they do deliver in spades.
4223;the directing of the movie was also flawless.
4224;Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, he has a good idea what the audience is expecting and he makes the right decisions.
4225;The anticipation that Scott evokes is what makes this movie special.
4226;They are shot with extreme precision, that when you watch it.
4227;The theatrical version's transfer is the first I watched, then I viewed the extended version.
4228;Scott does this same kind of staging in Bladerunner and Empire Of The Sun and it is hypnotic.2) His love of historical subject matter.
4229;this and Ben Hur are the greatest Roman Empire movies ever made.
4230;The movie is obviously full of historical inaccuracies and the combat scenes are obviously highly stylized, but hey, it's a movie.
4231;On that note, this was a pretty good movie.
4232;I was simply amazed at how beautiful this film came out.
4233;taking and Russell Crowe was perfectly cast.
4234;This film was a breath of fresh air.
4235;See it as soon as you can unless you can't stomach violence.
4236;Hollywood proved it still can combine entertainment with art if it really wants to bad enough.
4237;The most amusing thing about the film was that with all the British, Irish, and Australian accents I started to think that the British Empire started long before it actually did.
4238;Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott prove beyond doubt that outstanding filmmaking is still all about masterful storytelling.
4239;The heroic tale of Maximus the general and gladiator keeps you spellbound from opening shot to the ending credits.
4240;of course, the riveting visuals and perfect pacing of the film are all signature Ridley Scott and provide the story.
4241;telling with gritty, contemporary, and .
4242;Gladiator is an outstanding movie and certainly headed for hall.
4243;Perfect from all angles and so timely in its universal themes of heroism, strength, honor, and character.
4244;collect for all great film afficionados.
4245;Though I appreciate the recent reviews of how good the remastered version of Gladiator is .
4246;The movie itself is great.
4247;I think it's definitely worth owning.
4248;If you want great action, great settings, beautiful pictures and exceptional acting then get this movie !!!!!!!!!!
4249;Crowe Phoenix are great, the story is full of action, suspense, love, etc.
4250;I loved Roman movies since I was a kid.
4251;Russell Crowe truly represented all those great things we would like to be ourselves.
4252;The graphics were, of course, great and gave an astounding view of Rome at its height of beauty at its depth of immorality.
4253;Zimmer's music brought out the scenes with thought provoking melodies, orchestration and rhythms (e. g. waltzing during a battle) that helped carry the broad strokes of the story, the acting and the directing.
4254;Few movies compel me to watch it again and again, but this one is it!
4255;Maximus' new master sees him as a gladiator and he is forced to fight in the arenas.
4256;These fighting scenes are what make this movie so great.
4257;They beautifully choreographed and the action is filled at a breakneck speed.
4258;The technical wizardry of the day allows director Ridley Scott to recreate the Roman Coliseum in stunning detail.
4259;Eventually Maximus and Commodus face each in the arena and the film comes to a surprising conclusion.
4260;Mr. Crowe is superb as Maximus.
4261;He has a commanding presence on the screen and he nicely balances the certain degree of pomposity and arrogance that the role requires with a subtly that make Maximus seem real.
4262;The late Oliver Reed is great as the slave owner and Richard Harris has a fine cameo as the emperor.
4263;As great as Mr. Crowe is, it is Joaquin Phoenix who steals the movie as Commodus.
4264;He is perfectly evil in the role and he eats up every scene he is in.
4265;The film recently won the 2000 Oscar as Best Picture and Mr. Crowe took home the Best Actor award.
4266;High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.
4267;I shall probably count this movie among those I watch on a regular basis, the action sequences intermixed with the plot developement are very nicely done, you always find a little more in each scene that you probably missed the first time.
4268;this is truly a modern day epic.
4269;The cinematography in this film is great, as well as the casting and effects.
4270;Russell Crowe is excellent as is Oliver Reed.
4271;ray and are commenting based upon screen shots and others opinions.
4272;But it is the finest looking print of this movie.
4273;It is beautiful for the most part and whether you can see 11,000 arrows or 10,000 is irrelevant!
4274;if you love this movie then you will love this blu.
4275;The special features are wonderful.
4276;It is great to get a look into the brilliant mind of Ridley Scott.
4277;This is an excellent gift for someone who is interested in how to go from idea to film.
4278;The sections on script writing and costumes are particularly informative.
4279;Ridley Scott silenced naysayers with his fantastic Roman Epic, Gladiator.
4280;I absolutely love some of earlier Ridley Scott's films, and any Ridley Scott fan would absolutely love gladiator.
4281;It is a very visually slick film, the cinemetography is top notch.
4282;The look and feel is amazing.
4283;Part of the popularity of this movie has to deal with the amazing fight scenes that are portrayed in this movie.
4284;Yes, the fight scenes are incredibly directed and are very intense.
4285;These aspects just greatly enhance what underlies it all: A fantastic story about a man and his longing for home.
4286;The story and interaction between the characters is fantastic.
4287;it is often an epic and ever engrossing film.
4288;This is one of Ridley Scott's finest films.
4289;This movie is my favorite.
4290;It shows so many aspects to loyalty, greed, family, trust and betrayel.
4291;The performances are amazing and I can watch this repeatedly and never tire of it.
4292;The bonus discs are chocked full of behind the scenes and historical information on Rome and the making of the movie.
4293;I personally enjoyed the death scene: picking up his head, gasping, then falling down.
4294;Much has been made of the scale of the picture and of Russell Crowe's towering star turn.
4295;The kudos are well deserved.
4296;It's Ridley Scott's best film, as well as Crowe's most impressive performance.
4297;His performance gives the film its emotional core, even though many would argue that that feat goes to Crowe.
4298;props to an excellent production crew.
4299;Gladiator is, like Saving Private Ryan, a wonderfully renderred historical epic.
4300;A very impressive film, wonderfully restored!
4301;The color is magnificent .
4302;I enjoyed this version and I am happy to own it.
4303;Gladiator was one of the most anticipated titles on Blu.
4304;ray on the same day) has a fantastic picture and makes Gladiator look even worse.
4305;i dare you to name a better film in the past year.
4306;This movie is soo good, not only see it but it has to be in your collection!
4307;eS 6.1 Discrete Surround which means 7 separate channels giving you the best possible audial experience.
4308;The message of living for and following one's moral convitions by taking an honorable course of action is played out with phenominal courage.
4309;This movie is not for the faint hearted, however, it gives us a reconviction to stand up for what is morally correct and of value in life.
4310;I have personally never been as captivated with a movie in my life.
4311;Besides the fact that the movie is wonderful on many levels (acting, costumes, action, music(too evocative for words) sets, etc)and is layered thick with details missed on first and second viewing, there must be more.
4312;I know at least one judge who has seen it 20 times!
4313;There are two ways to be able to enjoy this move.
4314;The first, be completely ignorant of the history of the Roman Empire and enjoy it for the great heroic epic it is.
4315;The second (and way I chose) is to just ignore the errors, suspend disbelief, and enjoy it for the heroic epic it is.
4316;Richard Harris makes even over acting look good.
4317;And Oliver Reed is a joy to watch.
4318;The action scenes are very well done.
4319;The visuals are a true treat, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard.
4320;He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.
4321;in Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.
4322;Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can hear an old song once more beautifully rendered.
4323;Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.
4324;It has all the elements, including a great lead player and solid supporting cast.
4325;Yes Gladiator is a good movie, and yes, it is epic, in story, scale, and performances.
4326;But what seems to be overlooked here are the unmistakable parallels that can be drawn between this movie and Braveheart, the best epic in this genre.
4327;ridley Scott delivers a solid product that rivals his best work (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and Thelma and Louise).
4328;It may in fact be his best work to date.
4329;As you would expect he ultimately achieves this, but with a tragic conclusion that when compared to Braveheart now begins to feel clich d. please remember, however, that this is a good movie.
4330;in fact its one of the best movies in 2000 (and yes this does not say much, because this has been a dismal year for movies).
4331;This movie was the best of the summer.
4332;Great acting, plot, and cinematography were the best.
4333;This has been my favorite movie so far this year!
4334;A great film and some outstanding acting.
4335;Fiction or not, the story is believable and the characters are developed in a way where one can actually see them as real people.
4336;I recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction.
4337;i think its the best one on 2000.
4338;Powerful storytelling, beautiful sets that are stunningly realistic, and outstanding performances create a modern classic.
4339;The collectible Steelbook packaging is a cherry on top.
4340;the absolutely stunning cinematography starting with the very first scene of the romans fighting germanic tribes.
4341;the fantastic acting by crowe, phoenix and the rest of the cast.
4342;the pungent, exotic, enticing depiction of rome.
4343;this is filmmaking at its best.
4344;Okay, let's get the facts straight: GLADIATOR is a really good movie that had been very overhyped.
4345;The background of the film was specatcular, though I do think they went a little overboard with the setting, and the special effects/sound effects were amazing, too.
4346;Talk about excellent sound effects.
4347;And I think he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.
4348;The action is awesome, too.
4349;Sometimes, I believe the only reason this film won all those Oscars was because it was so overhyped and it hit big in the box office.
4350;But flat out, good film and definitely one that shouldn't be missed.
4351;I really enjoyed it and it gives accurate historical events and the setting and costumes make you feel like you've actually traveled back in time during the Roman Empire.
4352;But GLADIATOR is definitely worth your money and you definitely have got to see this film!
4353;The package came in good time.
4354;Gladiator, for those of us gifted movie goers with a large palet for action/drama, you will love this movie!
4355;Gladiator is the name of Maximus, a slave, who was once a general of the Roman Army uner a great (aged) king.
4356;I don't want to share much more, but this movie emphasizes the human spirit and the courage of a man, standing in the face of destiny and fighting.
4357;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
4358;It has an incredible and touching story with a great ending.
4359;Plenty of good action including a major battle in the beginning.
4360;The soundtrack is one of the best ive heard.
4361;soul's attention kind of movie.
4362;Evil vs. Honor, the parable of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of EXHILERATION, acheived ONLY via the absorbtion of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principlied, moral, ethical, self.
4363;actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic .
4364;this was a movie on a scale beyondf epic.
4365;I am pleased to report that the version I received, ordered on the 1st of December, was the remastered version.
4366;Pristine, with bold colors and exemplary contrast, this is how a blu.
4367;ray collector, and one worthy of showcasing your home theater system with.
4368;Highly recommended to those willing to take the (quickly dwindling) risk.
4369;I want a sharp wow factor, not technically accurate film reproduction (in terms of grain, color and blacks = more important).
4370;On the whole it's not an emotional film, which I found quite surprising, but if you like action and you're a lover of history (without casting too much of a critical eye on the accuracy of the history), then you'll love it!
4371;The special effects are brilliant and the storyline is good for what could potentially be a very boring film in the hands of the wrong director.
4372;Gladiator has and will change Crowe's status as an actor.
4373;Gladiator is an epic tale up there with Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Al Pacino's Godfather or Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator.
4374;A wonderful tale (as the preview/trailer states) of a General who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, and a gladiator who defied an emperor.
4375;Big sets and lots of help from today's computer technology.
4376;Disc 2 features commentaries, an HBO making of, deleted scenes, photo galleries, behind the scenes featurettes, and more.
4377;I utilize movies as a visual aide supplement to help them connect with the characters, setting, dialogue.
4378;This movie is about as good as can be made.
4379;It stands alone on so many levels
4380;Great combination of drama and modern hi tech special effects.
4381;ridley Scot's best so far.
4382;This movie is on par with Braveheart, if not better.
4383;The growling tigers are the best I've seen on film since Sheena QOJ in the 50's!
4384;It's just a plain good action movie, not unlike Mel Gibson's Oscar.
4385;winning BRAVEHEART, his PATRIOT, and Spielberg's last decent film the Oscar.
4386;The action is surrounded by and laced with excellent acting in the best British tradition.
4387;The two newbies, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, are good additions to the seasoned cast.
4388;Nielsen, a Sela Ward lookalike, holds up her role as the only sexy personage in the film very well.
4389;And speaking of scars, the perfectly.
4390;I've always been a fan of this movie, although general revenge plot was obviously ripped from the original Conan The Barbarian .
4391;This transfer is by far the best I have ever seen the movie look and sound.
4392;I love the movie (yes, it IS a movie, folks, not factual, so get over the factual issues and just enjoy it for the entertainment that it is) and so does my wife.
4393;One of, if not the, best films by Russell Crowe.
4394;Russ Crowe is great in this movie.
4395;makers long for
4396;can be found in a good Gladiator story.
4397;gladiator follows this tradition by taking what was once considered old news and pumping it full of modern day movie steriod.
4398;russell Crowe, who plays the part of General Maximus, is superb.
4399;I believe we may be watching the creation of a new superstar.
4400;In particular, the digital recreations of Rome and the Colussium are stunning.
4401;I'm sorry, but i found this movie very funny.
4402;It's a very early talky but a wonderful story and great acting for it's day.
4403;Obviously a great movie on several accounts.
4404;one of Ridley Scott's best
4405;by Russell Crowe
4406;Well worth the $10 i paid, Russell Crowe is a beast in this movie.
4407;The case is pretty sweet too.
4408;As a story, however, it is excellent, with stellar performances by the entire cast.
4409;Russel Crowe is known as a great actor, and this is definetely one of his finest movies.
4410;o. the story of this Roman general is uplifting and symbolic, nevermind unrealistic.
4411;But it is a very entertaining movie to watch, and if you don't I fear there is something wrong with your mind.
4412;Russel Crowe is perfectly cast.
4413;The script is well written.
4414;Many good films about ancient Rome have taken artistic license to make themselves entertaining.
4415;The imagination required to create a spectacle like Gladiator is justification enough to watch and enjoy.
4416;in addition to the many other merits of this film the action sequences are riveting though quite graphic.
4417;Director Ridley Scott (Alien) brings back the glory of the Roman Empire in the grand award.
4418;After escaping his execution, Maximus returns home and finds his family brutally murdered.
4419;With his courage and skill, Maximus earns the admiration of the Roman public and rivals the authority of the new emperor.
4420;Gladiator is an astounding action.
4421;packed movie spectacle that ranks as one of the best movies of 2000.
4422;Gladiator contains a powerful story, moving performances and a rich music score.
4423;The action sequences are truly spectacular.
4424;Russell Crowe delivers a powerful performance as the larger.
4425;disc Signature Edition is certainly one terrific must.
4426;winning epic picture is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format.
4427;The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent but the DTS sound delivers a remarkable home theater experience.
4428;minute Making of Gladiator documentary, the 50.
4429;The movie Gladiator was a very good movie
4430;Director Ridley Scott did a very good job at making a Rome, let's not take anything away from him.
4431;Hollywood is filling people's, espically kid's, minds with flase information that they think is true.
4432;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long while.
4433;Yet this was one of the few, that had a compelling story line combined with breath.
4434;In addition to the beatiful cinematography, music is simply amazing, thanks to Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrald for that, well done.
4435;there's no sex): a truly powerful.
4436;lead performance by Russell Crowe, stunning cinematography, the superbly paced direction that made Ridley Scott famous, and a moving soundtrack.
4437;crowe's brute magnetism powers Maximus, a heroic figure that Crowe manages to make entirely believable.
4438;The supporting actors are strong as well, particularly Connie Nielson (although she does hit one slightly off note at the end of the movie).
4439;folks, this movie is BIG
4440;But the movie's strengths dwarf its few weakness, and the overall effect is undeniably powerful.
4441;most movie critics are cynics, which predisposes them to dislike heroic epics.
4442;life Maximus described by Marcus Aurelius in The Meditations, is an example of strength, courage, and honor.
4443;Still, the propulsive force of Gladiator is so potent, it managed to win over a substantial body of critics.
4444;this movie is great one of the best moves that combines action and story telling
4445;Somewhat apprehensive, Crowe took his concerns to Scott, who consoled him with a confident, 'We'll make it up as we go along', or words to that effect.
4446;well what is the point of going on.
4447;and, hey, we all know advertising works, it's often clever and entertaining, it's lots of things, but it's just not great cinema.
4448;Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a roaring, romantic, moving spectacle about the glory that was Rome.
4449;This is a great film, one that brings back classic themes of the cinema that we haven't seen since the days Spartacus or Quo Vadis or even Ben.
4450;The purpose of a movie like Gladiator is to exhilarate the viewer and capture him with red.
4451;The screenplay by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson barrows from other films and molds into a riveting story, a simple yet entertaining tale.
4452;Ridley Scott (Alien, G. i. Jane) directs with the eyes of a master, with great taste for epic material.
4453;The cinematography by John Mathieson is rich, making some scenes look like classic paintings of Ancient Rome.
4454;The editor is Pietro Scalia, who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's JFK, he creates some great, gritty, bone.
4455;And of course, the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is effective, moving and a romping experience all in itself.
4456;Gladiator also works for women, it's not just a guy.
4457;flick, it has a nice, sensual feeling to the romantic material.
4458;This is fun, moving and enjoyable cinema.
4459;Gladiator will call you back for a second viewing.
4460;An outstanding portrayal of the barbaric customs of the Romans!
4461;From the opening battle scene to the climactic duel in the end, you're on the edge of your seat!
4462;Nonstop intense action and excellent acting make this movie a top.5 for me and my dad.
4463;going along with a dethroned General's motto: strength and honor.
4464;I own it, but it occured to me that it merits a special salute.
4465;The star of Gladiator is totally awesome, but Mel Gibson has more work along the same lines, than anyone.
4466;Both are great, I would like to see both of them with Tom Cruise is something spectacular.
4467;Russel Crowe is perfect as Maximus, he is a great actor in a career defining role.
4468;All of the actors were great and the film from beginning to end is truly a masterpiece of modern filmmaking.
4469;were a nice touch as well.
4470;an adrenaline pumping heart wrenching story.
4471;Really like this movie, always a classic.
4472;Although this movie isn't exact to Roman history it is still worth getting your hands on.
4473;Russell Crowe proves he has what it takes to become bigger in Hollywood.
4474;For Crowe fans, his acting is excellent and shows that he is capable of playing roles other than a cop.
4475;there is something about this movie that will make you keep putting in your player over and over again.
4476;On the positive side, this film has the unique atmospherics that you expect from his productions, the acting is strong, and he strives to inject interesting historical themes into the plot.
4477;I guess I could say its effects are so spectacular that Scott thought he could coast on them, that the film's content and characters have a laziness about them that I would not expect from a great filmmaker like Scott.
4478;It's just an action film, so I can imagine viewers who liked it would tell me to lighten up.
4479;Granted, I suppose I should look at it purely as an action film, and it is a good action film, with blood guts, and daring.
4480;The trouble is, I saw and loved The Duellists, one of his early films, so I know that he can pull off an absolutely first rate historical film, with realistic and yet unusual characters, without glaring make.
4481;believe, and deep themes that stick with the viewer, in my case for decades.
4482;but, like a child, I was enthalled with the film and watched with wide eyed wonder.
4483;The cinematography at the beginning of the film with the war scene was absolutely breathtaking.
4484;what I was surprised about was the great plot.
4485;human hero, the rugged male who stuck by his own morals no matter what.
4486;Yes, it was a bit American and individualistic, but it was done so well, it captivated me.
4487;ridley Scott of Blade Runner fame directed this film superbly.
4488;I particularly loved the frquest flashes to the fields of heaven .
4489;it was this mix of beauty and action that captured my interest.
4490;He was able to make me truly enjoy this film.
4491;The acting by Crowe was a great compliment as well.
4492;While not really being historically accurate, this film was fascinating and often made the heart race.
4493;I liked everything about it and the more I watch it the better I realize it is.
4494;You don't have to talk too much about this movie, everybody knows that it was one of the greatest superproduction of all times, the actors, the sites, the pictures, all this things makes it unic.
4495;this film is visually stunning.
4496;(By then we already know that he is a fearless and skillful warrior.)
4497;impoverished screenplay, director Ridley Scott keeps the narrative moving along at a brisk but appropriate pace.
4498;Although Crowe dominates the screen (and was later selected to receive an Academy Award as best actor), others in the cast provide strong performances.
4499;How ironic that a film so filled with brilliantly.
4500;It received an Academy Award as best film as well as for best costume design, sound, and visual effects.
4501;We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving.
4502;one of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed.
4503;ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters.
4504;He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film.
4505;But there's another moment between Harris and the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen that I liked very much.
4506;Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. 
4507;They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, This is a pleasant fiction.
4508;I felt this short scene so sophisticated.
4509;It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this relationship.
4510;the plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's  Fall of the Roman Empire, had Russell Crowe as Maximus, the proud well.
4511;loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).
4512;I liked the costumes a lot (worth the Oscar).
4513;it has a lot of extras, all very interesting.
4514;One of the best movies ever produced.
4515;I love the first scene in Germania.
4516;The movie is rendered with excellent skill on virtually all levels: camera work, lighting, musical score, sets.
4517;It stands as a stunning tour.
4518;force of the cinematic arts.
4519;the actual screenplay and the rendering of it are a little less impressive.
4520;He is kneeling, with his hands securely bound.
4521;hand and with both hands free.
4522;Today's Hollywood loves to wallow in such filth!
4523;I do not, and I sincerely hope you don't either.
4524;already among the top 15 best.
4525;disc edition features 17 minutes of previously unseen material and a very entertaining and revealing commentary with director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe, a first for the latter.
4526;the fresh extras on the additional discs are extremely well done and very watchable.
4527;The highlight is the lengthy, 200 minute, richly detailed documentary Strength and Honor: Creating the World of Gladiator that focuses on the films evolving screenplay structure, production and remarkable visuals .
4528;It's like he had one face on the whole time in the film and I was thinking what is he truly feeling right here.
4529;The tiger scene was particuarly interesting and the woman with the arrows.
4530;i prefer the real life action like Ultimate street brawls at least thats real.
4531;Sets are pretty much flawless and the costumes are well done, both of which create total believability in the environments.
4532;I was very impressed by Ridley Scott's truly magnificent depiction of his vision for the film.
4533;Richard Harris portrays the philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius very, very well
4534;Oliver Reed is also excellent as the gritty, wizened gladiator camp operator Proximo.
4535;russell Crowe brings great force of character to Maximus, a very high.
4536;earth and sensitive enough to be personally admired by his troops.
4537;He brings that combination of sensitivity, intelligence and able willingness to bring on extreme yet controlled force (simply and very effectively of emotion at times) to his scenes throughout the film to great effect.
4538;the Germania battle scene is probably most accurate and incredible depiction of Roman war techniques the screen will see for a very long time.
4539;Occasional suspension of disbelief is required there though
4540;Sit back and be impressed (and set your player to full.
4541;the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard (who invented her own language of indescribable sounds specifically for emotional effect) is masterful, helping carry the action and intensity along without interruption from scene to scene.
4542;the depiction of Imperial Rome was impressive overall, depicting it as somewhat more organized in layout than it actually was, again I suspect to support his depiction of the greatness of Rome for his vision of the film.
4543;The outside views of the CGI Colosseum again be nitpicked, but it's still very impressively done and the views from center stage of the roaring crowds in the realistic, well.
4544;detailed gleaming marble interior make up for it.
4545;the camera work is also excellent, especially when including the touchingly done Elysian Fields scenes.
4546;ridley Scott has set out to display the challenges faced by real people whose roots lay in a collectively held fierce desire to build something people of any time could look back at in both awe and humble respect, but who then found themselves having achieved most of that dream while also finding that realized dream half.
4547;present dark side of human nature.
4548;He succeeds magnificently
4549;This is a really awesome great movie!!!
4550;I think this is the best movie ever made!!!!!!!!
4551;This was the best movie I have seen in a long time.
4552;Not since Saving Private Ryan have I seen a movie of such intensity, power, and grandeur as to remain with me for days after viewing it.
4553;The classic story of revenge is well written into the time period, and superbly acted out.
4554;Joaquin Phoenix should also receive the Best Supporting Actor nod, his work as Commodus is brilliant.
4555;an incredible film I will enjoy watching for years to come.
4556;regardless of what critics might say, if a film has a lasting emotional and visceral impact on me, then I will strongly recommend it to others.
4557;the combination of stunning visuals, a moving musical score, and top.
4558;Both excellent films, and very moving, but once is more than enough.
4559;ridley Scott is a genius for transporting the viewer to alien worlds whether they are in the far future ( Blade Runner ) or the distant past, as he does here in Gladiator.
4560;The movie captivated me from the beginning action sequence.
4561;From there the movie just got better and better.
4562;This movie is definatley a movie for both sexes too: for the men you have the obvious action, and for the women you have well, Russell Crowe.
4563;Ridley Scott does a fantastic job directing this movie, bring ancient Rome back, forever immortalizing it.
4564;Joaquin Pheonix is great in this movie, playing the perfect bad guy.
4565;The graphics of this movie are awesome, i can just see the Collisseum in all it glory and feel the awe the citiznes must have felt just looking at the city.
4566;As a person who took Latin and study Roman history, and watching tons of movies about this time period, I can honestly say that this by far teh best of out of all of them.
4567;Scott has to be ranked up in the top 10 Director's in the last 50 years!
4568;Brillant film, excellent masterpiece, riveting performance's by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou: (who's making a name for himself in cinema) and applause for the rest of the outstanding cast put together including Richard Harris.
4569;This film is an attribute of pure genious, as far as, production, direction, and cinematography.
4570;This film is liken the movies of epic perportions of the late 1950's into the early 60's, with it's magnificent cast and colossal action.
4571;ray transfer is the best I have seen to this date with it's rich and vivid color, sound, aspect.
4572;I have seen this movie about a dozen times now, and never tier of it, everytime I watch it, I see something new.
4573;An powerful empire,a new ruler,and a man worthy enough to change a dynasty,a slave who would become a gladiator, a man who become legendary to his people.
4574;ridley Scott's epic so beautiful so intense , so gripping , and so dramatic that it can only be called truly epic.
4575;russel Crowe is an even more fitting potrayal of a Gladiator then even Kirk Douglas he gives his charachter more depth and a human side , it's evident that Crowe is one the best newcomers hollywood has ever seen he is very versitle in films and Gladiator only shows that to an even greater extent.
4576;joqiun Pheonix is a great match for Crowe giving Commodus depth and making us feel pity the he is the way he is and his hatered for Maximus and his uprising.
4577;Ridley Scott has an imaginative veiw to detail as some of the set's are detailed to what Rome would have looked like in this time the costumes accurate and the cinimatography is astounding.
4578;born General who has brought the Roman empire its final victory against the barbarians.
4579;i didn't want to see Gladiator, but Russell Crowe and Director Ridley Scott won me over.
4580;Sure we know it's all CGI, but Scott's trademark touches (smoky light, bustling crowds, and constantly having something .
4581;Best Russel Crow movie ever.
4582;It is one of the best Ancient history movies.
4583;Filmed well, lot's of action and adventure.
4584;There a scene where the emperor wonders what was so great about a battle that's going to be recreated in the arena for his entertaintment, what's so great about these gladiators.
4585;I like all of Crowe's work, but consider this one of his best movies.
4586;I agree with the other recent reviews, the Blu.
4587;russell Crowe won the academy award as best actor for his perfomance as Maximus, Roman general turned gladiator.
4588;He dominates the film from beginning to end, and a good thing too.
4589;Crowe is good enough to give this movie five stars.
4590;Amazingly, this extended version is meant to complement the 2.
4591;The bonus material alone is worth the price.
4592;This was an extremely well done movie.
4593;The acting was really good, too.
4594;Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release.
4595;Ridley Scott's epic vision of a wronged and enslaved Roman general, of political corruption, of revenge and honor is a prime example of what a good movie ought to be.
4596;The story of injustice righted is highlighted by spectacular action sequences that are extremely violent and realistic (which is what initially kept bringing people back to see the film in theaters) but the story is involving (thanks to Russel Crowe's brilliant performance) enough to warrant repeated viewings.
4597;All in all Gladiator is the best movie of 2000, period.
4598;Nothing released this year will match the beauty and grand scale of this film.
4599;So if you like good movies make sure you get your copy of this wonderful film.
4600;Expect plenty of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations (and wins) for this film, for direction, acting, cinematography, and special effects no other film has delivered the goods in such a spectacular package this year.
4601;Every fine detail in a characters face, in the architecture of the sets and city shots, every little rock in the dirt, every bit of detail I want to see pop out on the screen is gloriously there, something sadly missing from most Blu.
4602;I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's work.
4603;Alien and Thelma and Louise were wonderful, and he definately made a great comeback in this film.
4604;Gladiator is one of the grandest movies.
4605;The fight scenes were very real and dramatic.
4606;Russel Crowe was destined to play Maximus.
4607;Jacquin Pheonix played a wonderful villain in the film as well.
4608;This definately every Academy Award that it received.
4609;This movie is the greatest film based on the Roman times other than Ben Hur.
4610;I highly reccomend this film.
4611;The special features are so numerous there's a whole disk dedicated to them.
4612;The new movie, Gladiator, is sure to win everyone's heart, whether male or female.
4613;There is something for everyone.
4614;For the men, there is of course the blood of the coliseum, and for the women, there's the wonderful, new(to some), actor named Russell Crowe, who is sure to win many hearts as he braves the challenges that lay before him.
4615;Gladiator is a great movie, recommended to all!
4616;For all the great sword and sandal films of the 1950's Ridley Scott's epic recounting of the legend around the death of Marcus Aurelius stands out for it's economy of narrative diversion .
4617;Scott cuts right to the heart of how brave men live.
4618;Very exciting movie with excellent acting.
4619;Although the movie's a little too novelesque at times, its all done so well that you can't do anything but like this movie.
4620;written, and most of all truly spectacular film, powered by Russell Crowe's superb, Oscar.
4621;Filled with epic battles, striking scenery, and first.
4622;rate acting, Gladiator is certainly not to be missed.
4623;The opening battle scene is a harrowing, masterfully crafted piece of work, thanks to fine editing, brilliant cinematography, and of course, Hans Zimmer's excellent music.
4624;After winning battles in Africa, the group travels to Rome.
4625;crowe's performance is so good really because of his charisma, the way he looks and speaks.
4626;His powerful screen presence enables him to capture the audience's attention, and Maximus is really a character you can root for.
4627;Joaquin Phoenix is convincing and in telligent as Commodus, having an authoritative, commanding presence.
4628;The old pros Jacobi, Reed, and Harris are all great, but Reed stands out in the trio, giving a splendid performance and since he appears in the film longer, his character is fleshed out more.
4629;Nielsen is fine as Commodus' sister Lucilla.
4630;ridley Scott's direction is well done, keeping the story moving along at a reasonable pace.
4631;The screenplay is full of memorable lines and keeps everything in a classic tradition.
4632;John Mathieson's cinematography is terrific, with breathtaking shots and exquisite lighting.
4633;I really like how most of the beginning sequences are dismal and gray, and the scenes in Rome are sunny and bright, (Maximus says that Rome is the light).
4634;The production design is elaborate and and Rome is visually stunning, thanks to some seamlessly crafted computer work.
4635;Hans Zimmer's score is terrific and diverse, at some points rousing and at others somber, overall extremely effective and beautiful.
4636;The battle scenes are dazzlingly shot and edited, the standout being where Maximus and his fellow gladiators battle Roman charioteers.
4637;Still the others are eye.
4638;popping, graphically impressive pieces of work.
4639;And the ending is unforgettable.
4640;overall, in my opinion Gladiator was the best film of the year and is a powerhouse, tour.
4641;I absolutely love this movie.
4642;The acting is wonderful as with all Russell Crowe movies.
4643;Story line is great, directing is perfect, ect.
4644;It's a good action \ drama movie.
4645;I especially liked the music and plan on getting the soundtrack.
4646;I recommend this movie to people who like action movies that take place in Ancient Greece \ Roman times.
4647;No argument that this is a great movie.
4648;This is a brilliant work or historical fiction, with excellent acting, a decent plot, engaging characters and incredible spectacle.
4649;Those factors make up a completely enjoyable film which sucks you in and leaves you wanting more at the end.
4650;It's beautiful to watch and has a good story to boot, and that is more than enough for me.
4651;Russell Crowe is an unbelievably good actor and the move was so well done.
4652;I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie
4653;The movie has a strong story line the whole way through it.
4654;All the characters are well developed and do terrific jobs.
4655;The action sequences are great.
4656;Definitely a movie that can be watched more then once.
4657;Feel good story of revenge and honor.
4658;Gladiator is an amazing movie which is retold from a perfect historical standpoint.
4659;a. kind movie, not to be missed for ANYTHING!!!
4660;Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix put on a tale of epic proportions.
4661;Ridley Scott and crew do an outstanding job in recreating the shear power of the Roman empire and it's beginnings to an end.
4662;maximus (Crowe), the loved general, is finished with war in Germania as his valiant army finishes off the last of the opposing threat.
4663;The new emperor has decieded to host a series of games in his late father's honor.
4664;Maximus is flushed right into the center of Rome, where he gains the peoples respect.
4665;As each second passes a chill will race down your spine and then a warmth will race back up it, as you are thrown into the sand of the Colleseum.
4666;Scott, Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen all names known widely now because of this one spectacular feature.
4667;Excellent behind the scene footage and a log book written by the young actor.
4668;What a smart kid he is!
4669;At any rate, the movie's ideas of the Roman people are obtuse.
4670;This a rather sweeping statement.
4671;Heck, the dude's grim even before his family gets hanged 'n' burnt to a fine crisp.
4672;elapse . . . all the modern goodies.
4673;I'll take Kirk fighting against the net.
4674;The cinematography deserves five stars by itself.
4675;There are some of the most awe.
4676;inspiring visuals here that I have ever seen.
4677;And the more you watch it, the better it gets because you can really pay attention to the detail of the scenery.
4678;Then comes the great story line.
4679;It was just good writing and scripting.
4680;The characters are all very interesting and likeable and pitiful.
4681;And of course Russell Crowe is great to cheer for.
4682;I don't think there is quite perfection here, but I have yet to see a film that is perfect.
4683;In many ways, this one comes close.
4684;There are some great special features here.
4685;And not to mention the superior picture and excellent sound.
4686;Mr. Oscar (statuette) is waiting for you.
4687;This is one great adventure/drama movie.
4688;One of the best movie in the last Millineium.
4689;Superb story, great directing, and a great cinematography, a beautiful assemble of actors, very nice costume, make.
4690;I like this movie very much, I see why it won so many awards because it is really that good.
4691;This is the best gladiator film, and one of the best films ever made.
4692;This is Scott's best, Crowes best, Phoenixes best, and Harris steals every scene he is in (even though they are few).
4693;The action is amazing, from the opening grand scale battle to the climatic showdown between Maximus and Comadus (lets not forget the incredible chariots sequence) the action is just the greatest (though of course its not like the matrix, but just as good none the less because its traditional swordplay done phenomenally).
4694;The story is deep, the performances are superb all around, the cinematography is sweeping, the visuals are great, the score is unforgettable, the action is.
4695;well i covered that, its powerful and stunning.
4696;This is film making at its best, in everyway.
4697;One of the best films ever made, right there next to Braveheart and LOTR.
4698;I recommend Troy, Braveheart, and The Last Samurai if you like this because they are both just as magnificant, but if you have any taste DONT SEE ROB ROY because its a disgrace to true hero films like this and Braveheart.
4699;Excellent writing, acting, depth of characters.
4700;most everything Russell Crowe does in theater is very well done!
4701;There are excellent performances by Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris to compliment a strong screenplay and a beautiful score.
4702;The character of Maximus is surprisingly well developed in a subtle and very satisfying way
4703;Every shot is beautiful, and the movie does a wonderful job of recreating the feel of the period, with wonderful recreations not just of Rome but of the Roman world.
4704;dropping opening battle that stands as one of the great movie openings of all time (and is the first movie to accurately recreate a Roman fortified camp) and you have a fantastic movie.
4705;There is a lesson somewhere within the story.
4706;gladiator (Oliver Reed) who now sends men into the pits to fight as their owner.
4707;Crowe is terrific, Reed turns in a solid, workmanlike performance (in his last role, he died during the filming and at least the last scene he is in was a neat bit of computer/camera trickery).
4708;The acting, story and choreographed fight scenes were excellent.
4709;Russel Crowe has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with this superb performance.
4710;My highest praise goes to this movie, though, not for the aforementioned points, but for the portrayal of a man with honor and integrity, willing to die for what is right, for his country and for his honor.
4711;This seems lacking in our society today and it was refreshing to see such a great portrayal of the Roman Warrior Ethic (which is historically accurate).
4712;This will be required viewing for my children in a few more years.
4713;teens, but I believe it is necessary to accurately and powerfully tell the story of the times in which it is told.
4714;I love it when it first came out, and it's even better in blue ray.
4715;Great story, too bad it's a pure fiction.
4716;Somewhere in Ridley Scott's grandly engineered epic, hammered on and tinkered with by a horde of writers and rewriters, is a flesh.
4717;by taking power after the emperor's death and restoring the republic.
4718;and orders Maximus and his family executed.
4719;Maximus is a hit with the crowd, setting him against Commodus in a battle for the hearts and minds of Rome.
4720;The jerky visuals of the war sequences come across as faithfully as the polished exteriors in Rome.
4721;The varying degrees of color saturation are rendered amazingly well, from the drab, washed out exteriors in Germania to the earthy tones of Zucchabar, and the vibrant cityscape of Rome.
4722;This is a great commentary track that appeals to the more technically oriented film fan.
4723;The topics range from Scott's views on historical accuracy, to motivating the actors, to the challenges of making a film of this nature, and more.
4724;anamorphic scenes look quite nice, but have obviously not been through the same postproduction processing as the main feature.
4725;this is, for all intents and purposes, a music video.
4726;The Making of Gladiator is a 25.
4727;minute feature that is pretty much the typical cable television promotional making of that we've all come to know and love.
4728;A nice, and somewhat surprising inclusion is the 50.
4729;In my opinon, I believe that Russell Crowe gave one of his most outstanding performances ever, aside to The Insider.
4730;The battle and fight scenes are simply amazing, but I also found the story to hold true genuity.
4731;Quite simply put, this is one of the best modern.
4732;This movie was as entertaining the second time and it was the first for me, I highly recommend this movie.
4733;I believe it was Rome viewed as a series was an excellent depiction of the Roman times.
4734;One of the greatest movies ever produced.
4735;Excellent Cinematography, Directing, Editing, and last but not least, acting!
4736;A subpurb performance by Crowe.
4737;one of my all time favorite movies.
4738;As a student of the classics, not only did I find this film an accurate depiction of the Roman empire and its times, but I also enjoyed it immensely.
4739;It appeals to those of us who are not great fans of action films without its wonderful plot, excellent directing, and just overall beauty in filmmaking.
4740;The extras on the second disc are wonderful.
4741;Just a great film all around.
4742;I highly recommend this film to anyone.
4743;The film is moving leaving you with goosebumps and a sense of pride.
4744;I recommend this movie to all history buffs (LIKE ME) or to anyone.
4745;Great movie with an excellent High Definition Blu Ray transfer.
4746;One of the best movies of all times.
4747;I very much enjoyed the visual mastery of this film.
4748;Scott's direction, as always, is top.
4749;It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator.
4750;the true gem in this film, along with superior visuals, is the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix.
4751;I loved everything about the movie .
4752;but I will mention a few highlights that I found truly enjoyable.
4753;i loved the acting in the movie .
4754;And Connie Nielsen as the frightened mother and sister embroiled in palace intrigue is unforgettable.
4755;long special on the music and its composer on the accompanying second disc is a must.
4756;The little touches to the script, to portray reality 2000 years ago, are admirable.
4757;Pheonix is also really good, he plays his sadistic character with gusto, and if you know anything about the history of the Caesars you know they were usually stark raving mad.
4758;The film itself is beautiful, whatever you think of Ridley Scott as a director, he does know how to shoot a visually spectacular film, the openning battle scene is fabulous.
4759;This is an action packed winner, I really don't know anyone who did not like this film in some way and most loved it.
4760;Russell Crow is superb in the movie
4761;This film is one of the greatest of it's kind.
4762;the acting is superb, particularly the brooding intensity we see in Joaquin Phoenix's Character, Commodus.
4763;ridley Scott has succeded, once again, in bedazzling moviegoers with his vision and flair for effects.
4764;This is the best movie he has directed since Blade Runner back in the 80's.
4765;Product arrived fast and I watched it the night I received it.
4766;I recommend this movie and I recommend Amazon!
4767;Gladiator is a big budget film with great actors and amazing special effects that falls just short of the mark.
4768;russels Crowe is one of my favorite actors and I was hoping that he would come out swinging in this movie.
4769;Each scene is well conceived and laid out beautifully.
4770;The fight sequences are superbly choreographed and exhilarating to watch.
4771;The commentaries are interesting if you want to know how the film was conceived and the two additional features are more than the standard pre release commercials, they actually talk about some of the more interesting aspects of the movie.
4772;Ridley Scott did an amazing job here, with an equally amazing effort from cast members Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.
4773;Gladiator is a phenomenal film that portrays the Gladiators in all their guts and glory.
4774;Within the walls of the coliseum, the final scene plays out with superb, hard.
4775;There is family and loyalty, and also a love interest within the story.
4776;Epic, Surreal and Amazing eye candy for any viewer, this film is a modern day classic!
4777;I have seen the movie now twice and have found it be be one of Ridley Scotts best yet.
4778;He draws you in to the arena for some mind blowing battles.
4779;for those among us who like good period action films, it is a ,ust see movie.
4780;Russel Crowe did an excellent job in this film playing the betrayed general who was sent into the gladiator pits.
4781;It is a must see for any movie fan.
4782;Once you have seen it you will want to own it.
4783;This is a superb film from the opening battle scenes right through to the end.
4784;russell Crowe takes the leading role of Maximus, a Roman General who is betrayed by the son of the Emperor and he gives a commanding performance.
4785;In fact its a stellar cast all round with Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings all playing good supporting roles.
4786;the cinematography and cutting is excellent, and although this was made 7 or 8 years ago now, the CGI efects still look good to this day.
4787;There are some brilliant scenes inside the Colloseum, noteably where the Tigers are released during a Gladiator fight, and during the scene involving the chariots.
4788;There is no basis of fact behind the story, but in the end who cares this is just great entertainment.
4789;Title says it all, the movie is phenomenal.
4790;I must say that this was one of his best preformances in my mind.
4791;with the use of use of superb computer graphics, as well as exceptional costume work, the viewer is transported back to ancient Rome and into the arena.
4792;The film is full of action, political intrigue, and also deals with issues of love and faith.
4793;The cast is strong, the dialogs perfectally written, and the viewer is treated to the perfect amount of gore.
4794;this film is truly a work of art, and it is obvious that it aimed to please.
4795;[I wrote this review some years ago under an anonymous account.
4796;I strongly believe that the tremendous success of this movie at the box office and the awards is tragic testimony to how the art of film.
4797;The mixtures of fiction and fact were well done.
4798;This was truly an epic.
4799;one of the greatest summer blockbusters of all time Gladiator is action packed and kinetic.
4800;the opening scene is one of the best openings of a war movie ever.
4801;Joaquin Phoenix superbly plays his role.
4802;action packed with some of the best fight scenes around Gladiator packs a huge punch.
4803;Which brings me to Gladiator, the best picture winner of that year.
4804;The film is exciting with its chariots scenes and fights.
4805;Joaquin Phoenix is certainly effective in his supporting role.
4806;If you like exciting, action packed film, this is for you.
4807;If you want to see a real Best Picture winner, try the original Ben Hur.
4808;In addition, the audio is incredible.
4809;The uncompressed audio will make you feel you are in big theater.
4810;I do not typically what action flicks so it's been a long time I've seen something this good.
4811;I couldn't follow much of the fight sequences, and they made me really appreciate the talents of, say, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, whose choreographed action sequences are always displayed fully on the screen, sans quick.
4812;Definitely a movie that everyone should have in their on call in their repertoire.
4813;The regular movie was a great story, told like a legend rather than a Hollywood blockbuster.
4814;This edition just makes the original better.
4815;Best movie of the year by far, and one of the best movies of these times!
4816;Touching, action filled, just excellent!
4817;Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.
4818;There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe.
4819;The best performance in the movie by far comes from veteran actor Richard Harris.
4820;He goes up agains tremendous odds, triumphs, earns the respect of his people, and dies in the end, and right before he dies, Crowe sees a vision of his deceased family (Braveheart anyone?)
4821;If you're looking for a good Roman epic.
4822;The action of Ben Hur and fine writing of a great epic film screenplay combined with up.
4823;date, understated digital technology and a wonderful ensemble cast .
4824;this film is a visually spectacular and sonically intoxicating.
4825;Ridley Scott manages to put the viewer in the middle of the Roman Empire the way George Lucas hurled his viewers through outer space .
4826;The late Oliver Reed (Oliver, Tommy) also does a wonderful job.
4827;The costumes, the special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are something to be experienced at home, in DTS, on a good surround sound system.
4828;Thank God it doesn't detract from the film, and in some places the ST is quite effective.
4829;Gladiator is a dark and violent tale laced with some very cool action sequences.
4830;style sweeping epic, while on the other hand, it tries to be a dark story of revenge, not unlike the very cool Conan the Barbarian.
4831;As impressive as the scope is, the plot of Gladiator is both dull and familiar.
4832;You know, the period epic that obtains a loyal legion of fans and goes on to win a handful of Oscars.
4833;Gladiator, meanwhile, serves up some amazing bits of action, but begs you to take it seriously the rest of the time.
4834;Gladiator stuns and mazes you with not just a brillant story , but Ripley Scotts legendary amazing viewpoint and telling of Maximus' story and the landscape surrounding him.
4835;it's a movie worth it's cost and is somethign to be watched along with Spartacus and Ben Hur.
4836;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
4837;I'm not usually a big Russell Crowe fan, but I thought he was incredible in this movie.
4838;I totally bought into his character.
4839;This is a great movie to watch if you aren't feeling particularly motivated with your life.
4840;Watching Maximus journey is also really inspiring.
4841;I have liked most of his films.
4842;Braveheart is a much better film than this.
4843;That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace.
4844;This is going to be the first big hit of the spring/summer movie season.
4845;Action, intrigue, romance, huge battle scenes, betrayal, vengence, and death.
4846;this was a good one.
4847;A general, turned prisoner, turned slave, turned gladiator, turned hero of the Roman Empire.
4848;He is sold into slavery, and becomes a Gladiator, and vows revevge on the new Emperor.
4849;He agrees to give Maximus his freedom, if he can get the crowds to love him and see him as a hero.
4850;This is one you need to see in the theater.
4851;tHE GOODThe acting, the sets, the cinemetography, the battle at the beginning was excellent, the fight scenes, the ending.
4852;And definitely see it at least once in the theater.
4853;This is one both men and women can enjoy.
4854;There are elements for both genders.
4855;i most definitely give this one an A+.
4856;I don't even know how to start about this movie it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
4857;It has a lot of nice fights, good story, and just really awesome.
4858;If your looking for a good action movie mixed with adventure this is the movie for you trust me.
4859;I was very impressed with the reconstruction of the Colosseum using 3.
4860;I absolutely liked the movie aside from the slow beginning and shaky camera angles.
4861;The special effects and the sets was pretty amazing too.
4862;russell Crowe did a good job too.
4863;The scene where he found his son and wife crucified and burnt just broke my heart.
4864;The more I watch it, the more I like it.
4865;I like to watch the montage of unused scenes with the beautiful music playing in the background and the Making of featurette.
4866;speaking of the music, the music in this movie is so beautiful and haunting.
4867;Definitely the best movie for last year.
4868;I'm greek and I know the history of the facts and altough there are some historical inaccuracies in the movie, cast's performances are terrific, with Russell Crowe being the best of course.
4869;This movie is definitely Ridley Scott's masterpiece.
4870;Incredible scenes, adventure, action, special effects.
4871;Pick a scene: Daddy love me, General love me (or else), sister love me, people love me, senate love me, little boy love me.
4872;This is the good remastered version.
4873;Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see B1R2.
4874;in addition a review I read somewhere said you can tell by the title screen at the beginning.
4875;Its a minority all in a hoot on this one.
4876;Many have said it, so I'll be succinct.
4877;If you are a fan of this film, more than likely you'll find the Extended Edition enjoyable as well.
4878;Thats a welcome addition to me.
4879;other than that, great movie .
4880;added scenes for the most part add to my enjoyment of the film.
4881;Special effects will always amaze me.
4882;Love, hate, action and torment will keep you in the story.
4883;I wish that i had watched Gladiator on the big screen as its a fantastic film, with some excellent fight scenes.
4884;Russell Crow (Maximus) plays his part with unpresidented pride and makes the character come to life.
4885;Im not going to send it back because i doubt they will com out with another for sometim and im content with the way it is right now.
4886;and he does, as he leads you in the beginning through a raw epic.
4887;with great quips like, at my mark, unleash Hell and what we do in life, echo's in eternity .
4888;through the rest of this truly fantastic movie.
4889;This is the best movie of its kind since 10 time Academy Award winner: Ben Hur.
4890;disc one has both the theatrical release ,which Ridley Scott claims is the Director's cut , as well as the Extended version with plenty of additional footage.
4891;I have watched the Gladiator many times and always enjoy it.
4892;One of these days I will travel to Pompei myself.
4893;this is the best movie u could ever see, it has great secial effects, great storyline, and the fastest moving movie you could ever see.
4894;this is the must see movie of the your.
4895;even if you dont like violence and blood see it because you will enjoy everything about it.
4896;the stunning aspects of this movie will give u chills.
4897;The film that recusitated the historical epic, Gladiator is an awesome filmmaking achievement.
4898;edge special effects, and breathtaking performances help to take the viewer back to the Roman era, a time of both intolerable cruelty and technological advancement.
4899;minute Theatrical Cut, and the 171.
4900;Russel Crowe is great as a vengeful gladiator, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the PERFECT villain.
4901;The extended edition brings the runtime to over 3 hours, and it's well worth watching.
4902;I am totally shocked that Ridley Scott directed it, since he is one of my favorite directors (e. g., Alien, Bladerunner).
4903;for the rest of the movie: feh!
4904;This movie rates as one of the best I've seen in many years because it can evoke so many emotions that run the gamut from deep despair to fantastic excitement.
4905;It is strange that Ridley Scott's Gladiator is the one film he has directed that was honored with the Academy Award for Best Picture.
4906;It is strange because of all the films he has made, Gladiator is easily one of his more mediocre efforts.
4907;After he spectacularly triumphs in a vital military campaign, Marcus names him protector of Rome.
4908;Under the mentorship of Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus fights his way up the competitive ranks and becomes a beloved figure among the public.
4909;Gladiator is a mixed bag from start to finish.
4910;The special effects work done with Oliver Reed's stand.
4911;in is impressive but the special effects work done with the computer.
4912;inspired work sometime in their career and Gladiator is clearly Scott's creative hiccup.
4913;the entire second disk is full of extras, like behind the scenes featurettes, the making of, etc. the sound is crisp as is the movie.
4914;i absolutely agree that the recreation of the Coliseum is very impressive and Ridley Scott, as he's done so often, conveys a seemless sense of style and scale.
4915;the battle sequence with the volleys of fire arrows was exceptional.
4916;Maximus winning despite being injured and drugged.
4917;Maximus was barely hit by Commodus despite the fact that early on we see Commodus training and being quite good.
4918;(a better executed duel was the way Rob Roy ended .
4919;i don't hate this film
4920;Thanks guys, really appreciate that.
4921;This is a good movie.
4922;It has a enjoyable story to it.
4923;I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy watching Gladiator.
4924;It's interesting how throughout the whole movie our Gladiator is really a person who would rather not kill, but does so because he has to.
4925;The success of this film is an evil portent for where our culture may be headed.2.)
4926;His strong faith in these gods is depicted as a stabilizing and grounding influence in his life, over and against his semi.
4927;In light of who the Roman gods actually were, was Crowe's character's faith reasonable, or worthy of admiration?
4928;For example, Crowe's character is sure his loved ones will go to a heavenly afterlife, partly because they were a target of evil, but the movie begins with Crowe butchering thousands of Germanic tribesmen .
4929;Although I think that Russell Crowes performance was Oscar worthy, his perfect performance in A Beautiful Mind was the part that should have won him the golden guy.
4930;I saw if 3 times in the theatre alone, because it captivated me.
4931;Everytime that I watch this film I am transported in time.
4932;The score is superb and one of the best ever.
4933;It helps to move you through the film from scene to scene.
4934;This is what movie making comes down to
4935;Russel Crowe is unmistakeably the reason of this movies success.
4936;The movie starts of with action and the brute force that you woul expect in war, but then brings you in with drama and death.
4937;This is my favorite movie of all times.
4938;I love the great acting and the action is immense.
4939;This is one of the all time great movies and one of my favourites.
4940;Russell Crowe puts in an absolutely epic performance, one of his finest ever.
4941;Ridley Scott does a masterful job in directing this, and it is clear for all to see his vision and ideas throughout the film.
4942;without giving away any spoilers, I would also state that this is one of most visually pleasing, and historically accurate portrayals of historic Rome.
4943;i would definitely recommend the Blu Ray version for this to really take advantage of all the special effects, action scenes, landscapes and scenery.
4944;cuz some parts of it was actually pretty awesome.
4945;i have always loved this movie.
4946;and to see in blu ray and theater sound was super fantastic.
4947;Gladiator is a wonderful retelling of the timeless story of good versus evil .
4948;a brilliant example of this hero archetype, a man who wants nothing more than to live happily with his own family, but is called by destiny to serve the good of the nation.
4949;He has a job to do, an empire to serve.
4950;I happen to be an ancient historian and I find that I can best enjoy movies and films set in the ancient world if I don't expect them to be realistic.
4951;Its good to see both veteran actors and younger ones interacting so well.
4952;paced and terrifying experience and the quick, spiraling movements did a good job of making me feel overwhelmed at times.
4953;We're using it in the Roman History class this semester and it should generate a lot of good discussion.
4954;The acting is spectacular and Russell Crowe was extroidinary for his role.
4955;Rome is brought alive again and the empire is not forgotten with the younger generation.
4956;I do also compliment the soundtrack, which I also own.
4957;The music is emotional and moving.
4958;When paired with the majestic, perfectly balanced images and story line, it creates a marvel far set apart from Hollywood's usual flicks.
4959;If ever there was a film in the modern age that is so accurate and astonishing, Gladiator is it.
4960;When I first saw this movie, I thought it was pretty good.
4961;Despite the extent to which it was overrated, it is still a very cool movie.
4962;Obviously one of the greatest films of all time, but have you seen the Extended Version?
4963;It's got a few scenes that weren't in the theatrical version and they add so much to the story.
4964;Definitely worth watching on Blu.
4965;I fully concur with the other reviews here of the Blu.
4966;This is, without a doubt, one of the most historically accurate films of all time.
4967;This is especially true with period films (films that take place long ago).
4968;Although it is historically inaccurate Gladiator is a true epic, and it pleases me greatly to see hollywood returning to the age of epics.
4969;since the 70's movie lengths have been getting smaller and smaller , and with the increase in ticket prices it's nice to see movies worth the investment.
4970;ridley Scott is a fantastic director amongst the best in the buisness like Fincher, Gilliam, or Mendes.
4971;Great acting by all actors.
4972;Teriffic movie with great individual performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.
4973;The story line evolved overtime going from the role of the great Roman leader to a slave, and then to a Gladiator.
4974;It is a very intense movie which deserves to be watched by any person or people who like Rome and it's feats.
4975;This is an amazing, engrossing, and brilliant film.
4976;First of all, the extras are what I call extra extras .
4977;There are hours of REALLY interesting content.
4978;From the cute diary of the kid, to historical presentations of costumes, gladiators, and culture, to behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes, the extras really deliver.
4979;As mentioned by others, this BD transfer relies on digital noise reduction methods and edge enhancement to clean up the image.
4980;creating a master version from using actual ENTIRE film.
4981;Gladiator promises the return of the great action spectacle of the 1960's but instead delivers a so.
4982;but the Devil always hasthe best tunes.
4983;Connie Nielsen is so beautiful.
4984;but the great acting comes from the late Oliver Reed.
4985;the movie looks great .
4986;And I amafraid that I want something more than simple visual thrills( even though you get those in spades ).
4987;Then the movie becomescompletely incredible from that point.
4988;I love Gladiator movie with Russell Crowe.
4989;He make the good face.
4990;I hope he make Gladiator 2.
4991;It be good movie too.
4992;I see Russell Crowe and his good face when my husband make the sex with me.
4993;The clarity of sound, color and action cannot be duplicated.
4994;The movie reels you in and you feel like you are there in that time period.
4995;The acting giving by Russell Crowe is overwhelmingly great along with the other actors portrayals.
4996;Gladiator is one of those movies that comes along and makes you watch in awe of how amazing everything in the movie is.
4997;The cutscenes of the field and the gates give a surreal feel to the movie which makes it that much more enjoyable.
4998;The action is well done with not so much gore as Braveheart.
4999;One of my favorite movies of all time.
5000;I was so excited to see the extra seventeen minutes that weren't included in the theatrical version.
5001;Gladiator , with Russell Crowe in the lead role, and Ridley Scott at the helm, is a modern mega.
5002;The toga'd characters, the gladiatorial combats and the devouring tigers in the arenas all create a sumptuous and magnificent feast for the imagination, an image of the splendour of Roman times.
5003;Thanks a lot to previous reviewers to point it out.
5004;Gladiator won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
5005;This was a good old fashioned epic with plenty of action, spectacular special effects and a great actor at the core of the story.
5006;It was quite a spectacle
5007;Although there are some of those I think I'm gonna hurl moments, there is a lot more to this movie.
5008;Reason #3: Ridley Scott Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A. d.
5009;This is a movie that, I think, will win these Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor.
5010;russell Crowe, Best Supporting Actor.
5011;ridley Scott, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Choreography.
5012;That might sound like a bit much, but once you see the movie, I can almost promise you that you'll agree with me.
5013;Short and simple: this movie is brilliant.
5014;Russell Crowe's flashbacks in the film are especially beautiful and touching.
5015;Overall, the entire movie is extremely well done.
5016;the epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott (Alien) and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, Gladiator, who is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor.
5017;After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar (Richard Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing.
5018;with a budget of over $100 million, Scott certainly delivers the goods.
5019;Gladiator transcends the notion of blockbuster that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and Ben.
5020;Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc), but also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting
5021;From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film.
5022;The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety.
5023;In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!)
5024;the cast is generally very strong.
5025;Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character.
5026;His accent occasionally may occasionally annoy, but this aside, he was well and truly up to the billing.
5027;The old guards of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.
5028;So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for?
5029;The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing.
5030;And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualize the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe.
5031;A visually exhilarating masterpiece that is not only one of the biggest motion.
5032;picture spectacles of the decade, yet considered to be one of the most powerful as well.
5033;I thought this was a really great movie.
5034;The fighting scenes were really great as well as the story and acting.
5035;If you liked Bravehart and movies like that I think you'd really enjoy this movie.
5036;I thought this would be one of those movies where I'd hate the ending but it was played out really well and I actually liked it.
5037;I think this would be a good movie for anybody.
5038;if you want to see a movie like this but better, see the last samurai or braveheart.
5039;this is surely russell crows best work.
5040;This movie very much moved me in ways i can not describe.
5041;Maximus Decimus Meridius is a legend, and Russell Crowe blew this movie out of the water.
5042;Gladiator by Ridley Scott won a lot of awards and was praised by a number of people.
5043;It is a gritly movie, with revenge, honor, triumph and some decent acting.
5044;It will easily appeal to people who are drawn to battle and blood sports.
5045;The days of great epics are gone.
5046;Many have compared it to Spartacus and found this wanting.
5047;Spartacus had spectacular acting and screenplay.
5048;spartacus on the other hand had Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas give magnificent performances.
5049;I shudder to think that they go back home thinking that what they saw was the truth.
5050;This movie had a good score and decent photography, so I give it 3 stars.
5051;Without a doubt the best movie of 2000, and an Oscar contender.
5052;All aspects of this movie are gorgeous.
5053;the scenery, acting, soundtrack, costumes, I could go on but see it and you'll understand.
5054;Somebody gets the scripts of Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire, and Enter The Dragon.
5055;I bought this specifically because it is one of my favorites, and I wanted the Blu.
5056;lasting wound in the Roman general's mind.
5057;When I saw this movie in the theater, I was absolutely transfixed.
5058;I have never scene a more incredibly detailed, beautiful and exciting epic in my life.
5059;The moment the war began at the start of the film, I was glued to my seat.
5060;The visuals of Rome and the Colluseum were breathtaking.
5061;Joaquin Phoenix SHOULD have won Best Supporting Actor.
5062;Incredible cinematography, top notch acting and heart.
5063;stopping action wrapped into one beautiful package.
5064;This movie is one of the best you may ever see.
5065;When I heard this film won best picture, I was shocked.
5066;Sure, it's a movie, but to find it entertaining. . . .
5067;One of the strongest attributes to the movie, besides the character of Russell Crowe, is the cinematography.
5068;Ridley Scott is a master at creating a unique ambience.
5069;The DTS track is especially powerful for those with Home theater and makes the movie seem that much more dramatic.
5070;Is it a sweeping epic?
5071;This is the kind of movie that I love the most, one that leaves me with so much to say about it that I could write a book.
5072;This is the kind of movie that movies were invented for.
5073;And Maximus, who loved the emperor like a father, agreed, but even said that all he really wanted was to go home to his wife and his young son.
5074;Gladiator is one of those movies that you can watch over nad over again.
5075;every time i watch it i find something new to think about.
5076;There are so many small details in the film.
5077;Impressive movie with great acting by Russel Crowe and Joachim Phoenix as the tacit Roman General vs. the nutty emperor.
5078;There are plenty of fight scenes, some great mano a mano action and some beautiful shots of Rome that make you wonder if you are in the right movie as the grey scale hits big.
5079;Now released in Blu Ray / Steelbook and surprise, surprise 
5080;it is still a 5+ star movie.
5081;and the format it is released will never change the fact it is a 5+ star movie and one of the best movies all time, in this reviewer's humble opinion.
5082;This movie is a classic, period.
5083;Maybe now 5++ stars?Forget about the fact it is probably one of the most historically accurate movies Hollywood has ever produced.
5084;probably the performance of anyone's career.
5085;And let's not forget that this movie was so good, that even Joaquin Phoenix turned in a good performance!
5086;the plot and story itself was well laid out and well executed .
5087;and that alone make it a great movie.
5088;But other than that, the movie looked great in Blu Ray .
5089;One of the best movies ever made.
5090;i was looking for the whole super fly home theatre experience, and this just bombed.
5091;What it proved to be was a TYPICAL epic with the basic plot of every other epic ever made.
5092;The acting is done fine but was not superb by any means.
5093;It's time to expand our minds.
5094;Movies such as Traffic accomplished this goal.
5095;Gladiator won because it had cool battle scenes which were not the greatest ever made.
5096;I have watched all of this film and I have to say.
5097;Russel Crowe, got to give it to him.
5098;He's been in films before and now he is a star.
5099;This was a fantastic movie.
5100;I enjoyed myself very much watching it.
5101;Knowing full well the many historical errors of Gladiator, I must once again reiterate that despite these I loved the movie.
5102;Of course, the special effects and the acting were good as well.
5103;Great deal, for a Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!
5104;This is the remastered version of Gladiator and it looks great and sounds great and a worthy movie to own.
5105;This movie stands next to Titanic as the best movie in the past five years and should cruise into the Oscars with at least ten nominations and leave with the Best Picture Award.
5106;Crowe's performance is magnificent as is Richard Harris's as a dying Caesar.
5107;This movie is a display of cinmatic beauty and should be a part of everyone's movie collection.
5108;Ridley Scott's insightful and brilliant commentary, combined with a fabulous score and stunning visuals make for a truly epic home theater experience.
5109;Other special features, such as the deleted scenes and treasure chest further enhance the experience.
5110;YeeeeeeAaaaaaahhhh booooooooooyyyyyyyyyyy love this movie it is one of the most bestest greatest most awesomeness creative movie of all time
5111;It is the story of how a man overcomes both disastrous events and faces his personal struggles.
5112;All the characters in this movie are wonderfully real and the movie has a great soundtrack also.
5113;It took me until the third viewing to understand how masterfully he was portrayed.
5114;Ridley Scott is a genius!
5115;an excellent tale of ancient gladiators and one man's quest to avenge his family that were taken from him.
5116;A great film and enough has been said about it already, so here's the trick to seeing a hidden section on the 2nd disc showing more about the cut Rhino scene.
5117;Then press enter and that will take you to the test footage of the computer animated rhino and also the full text of how the fight would have been played out.
5118;The dialogue is almost as good and the acting is better.
5119;This is a must for anyone interested in the film process.
5120;This documentry on Disc 2 adds punch but the real gem is Disc 1.
5121;There's always something screwy about these award thingies.
5122;Maybe some kind of simple award that states, You have made one of the greatest film scores in film history.
5123;Even though its 155 minutes long, it keeps you interested with amazing battle scenes and well written plot.
5124;This film was so beautiful, the acting, the directing, everything was top notch.
5125;russell Crowe gives his finest performance in this picture and will probably never give this kind of performance again!
5126;This is also Ridley Scott's best movie (slightly better then Alien and Blade Runner).
5127;This was an instant classic and will remain a classic for the life of film.
5128;Russel Crowe does an excellent job in his role.
5129;The drama and suspence are comparible to Braveheart and Patriot!
5130;This should have been a good idea for a great entertaining as well as powerfully emotional movie in which the audience engage themselves in spite of the fact that the story is 2000 years ago.
5131;It's also has a lot of strong visuals and fine performances through out the entire film
5132;tHE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is a flawed film perhaps, but still is a great one in the way it investigates the corruption of power, which is also a very contemporary theme.
5133;All that remmains is the fact is that he is still good looking.
5134;okay, I admit, the first 20 minutes battle sequence is quite interesting visually, and that's my reason for the one additional star.
5135;Gladiator is a worthy successor to the great sword and sandal films of the past.
5136;With a classic story, great acting, spectacular cinematography, and an incredible score, Gladiator is a true epic in every sense of the word.
5137;Russel Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix' performances are exceptional, and you find yourself despising Commodus(Phoenix) and actually cheering for Maximus(Crowe).
5138;The larger political story gives flesh to the main arc of the film.
5139;The film is fairly accurrate in its portrayal of the Roman gladiators, and the characters of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus are based on real emperors.
5140;The chapter segmentations are done very well and you are able to skip to every major scene without any fast forwarding.
5141;The cinematography and story line are great.
5142;As the true movie lover that I am, I can be very critical.
5143;The story line is tried and true, and very effective.
5144;It made my heart race and my spirit soar.
5145;I thought they did a pretty good job redoing Rome.
5146;I still prefer models, mattes, real set construction.
5147;especially the opening scenes with the barbarians.
5148;The action is the draw for this film.
5149;He's one of my favorite character actors and does a good job as a local gladiator manager.
5150;joaquim does decent job making the evil Commodus almost sympathetic in spots.
5151;finally, I liked the fact that they presented the ancestor worship/veneration that in some ways was more important to the average Roman than the Zeus pantheon.
5152;Russell Crowe does an adequate job in this long epic .
5153;He doesn't have the charisma and draw of other great actors, but he does well enough to keep you watching.
5154;The battle scenes were good, although not at the level of greats like Braveheart or the Patriot.
5155;i found much of the movie to be slow moving, although the subplot with Ceasar and his sister was intriguing.Young Ceasars character played by Joaqin Phoenix was excellent.
5156;He had me hating him within minutes!Over all this is a good film, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.
5157;To begin, this movie is visually stunning.
5158;Russel Crowe (Maximus) does a great job convincing us he is moral man with values, fighting against a corrupt government and emporor.
5159;He is extremely convincing in his hatred and jealousy for Maximus.
5160;This film greatly parrelled the earlier epic Fall of The Roman Empire starring Sofia Loren (who played Lucilla).
5161;I recommend that film to anyone who loved Gladiator, as it had a direct influence on this film, including characters and plot.
5162;Crowe proves he is a world class star with his versatile, passionate and physically virile performance.
5163;This movie engages the senses and the mind and lingers in the memory.
5164;Based loosley around the film 'Fall of the Roman Empire', 'Gladiator' is a brilliant epic from director Ridley Scott, bringing the glory and bloodshed of ancient Rome back beautifully.
5165;Whether its the gorgeous visual effects, moving story and music, gritty battle sequences, or superb acting that gets you, one thing is for certain: Gladiator is an epic adventure, worthy of all its hype.
5166;russell Crowe's explodes into the spotlight with his role of Maximus, the greatest soldier and general in the Roman army.
5167;the story itself is beautifully crafted around actual historical events.
5168;By using these true events to act as connection points, the story flows together, with love and war and revenge all into one.
5169;The music, by composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely outstanding, though the Celtic feel of it sometimes seems out of place.
5170;The special effects are impressive
5171;And acting is excellent from all.
5172;But these are minor in the grand scene.
5173;Gladiator is by far one of the best movies to come out in quite a while.
5174;It easily ranks up with BraveHeart, El Cid, and other historical epics, and deserves every award it has gotten and will get.
5175;Ridley Scott must have known something that nobody did.
5176;themed movie could sell big bucks at the box office again.
5177;Russell Crowe gives the best performance of his career to date.
5178;So Ridley Scott fixed that by giving Gladiator one of the best story lines of the year.
5179;The 3 hour epic keeps you content during every minute.
5180;It's still no Fall, but it is a more satisfying film than the one released in cinemas.
5181;Very impressive extra features too.
5182;This film achieves Ridley Scott's goal of portraying the Roman time period and the gladiator's plight in stunning fashion.
5183;With the combination of a captivating plot, marvelous acting, and second to none special effects, Gladiator shines as one of the best films recently produced.
5184;the placement of actors and their performance in this movie is nearly perfect.
5185;Russell Crowe is captivating from the very start, and his character's homely attributes make him nearly impossible to dislike.
5186;Crowe exhibits the qualities needed to perform in this type of role.
5187;The character, along with Phoenix's one of a kind touch makes Commodus create a sense of disgust in the viewer.
5188;the historical aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is very well done.
5189;Though it may not be completely accurate, it illustrates the grandeur of the Roman Empire magnificently and creates a good balance between history and Hollywood.
5190;The plot is filled with passion and the classic themes of freedom and the power in people.
5191;The action sequences in the movie are great with nearly uncensored views of the bloody life a Roman gladiator.
5192;Ridley Scott achieves a nearly perfect balance between having to sell in the box office while still attempting to be as historically accurate as possible.
5193;I would recommend this film to everyone.
5194;This film is about strength and honor of a roman Centurion.
5195;This movie is my favorite action movie, although it is a little bit bloody and gory, and a few guys get their heads and arms chopped off.
5196;This movie really filled a special warm spot in my heart.
5197;The opening battle scene is impressive, but the movie takes a nose dive from there.
5198;This movie is great for couples to see together.
5199;It is not just a movie fit for guys who love blood and guts but instead it is also very poetic and moving.
5200;This is, pure and simple, an abuse of history for the purpose of glamour.
5201;At best, it's simply a costume drama fantasy.
5202;a Roman general who's actually a man of the wheat.
5203;But yes, the fight scenes were often wonderful.
5204;Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix are both terrific actors that bring this movie into a great climax.
5205;All of it is historically accurate and it is one of the best made films ever!
5206;There are several reasons why Hollywood stopped making epic movies and just a few short years ago the great movie epic was said to be dead.
5207;well, the great movie epic is back.
5208;gLADIATOR is the story of Maximus, a fictional Roman general.
5209;Maximus is the greatest of all Rome's generals.
5210;After stellar performances in L. a. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR has cemented Crowe's place with the top echelon of Hollywood's elite.
5211;director Ridley Scott has revived the Roman movie with this awesome epic.
5212;The melding of great performances, visual scenery, special effects, and sound story is a testimony of Scott's skill as a filmmaker.
5213;gLADIATOR also contains a moral message.
5214;Maximus is a religious man
5215;Yet, it is how we live our lives that makes a difference.
5216;This is a perfect example of how Hollywood politics often influence the Academy Awards.
5217;The acting is okay and the story is alright.
5218;I absolutely loved this movie.
5219;An epic story of betrayal and revenge
5220;This is a good movie that does a great job with the special effects and creation of fighting in the roman colliseum.
5221;Ridley SCott did a brilliant job with this one.
5222;But what propels the movie above other epics is Russell Crowe.
5223;He is amazing and keeps your attention.
5224;He will hopefully always be a big star.
5225;He deserves to be because of his raw talent.
5226;Jaquien Pheonix also did a nice job here as the emperor.
5227;And by the way, the action scenes were amazing!
5228;and he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.
5229;I was pleasantly surprised and loved it.
5230;com and took it over to Dad's place for him to watch and he was pleasantly surprised.
5231;Every character in Gladiator was essential to the whole story, every line uttered was of utmost importance, it was so easy to keep my mind on the story .
5232;I absolutely love this movie!
5233;I was so glad to see it at a reasonable price so I got it!
5234;Came fast and in great condition.
5235;Rarely do you get a movie that has it all,story,acting (Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix are fantastic!)
5236;No doubt the best movie of 2000.
5237;The gladiatorial combats are a treat.
5238;It had a profound effect on me and I was thinking about it for ages afterwards.
5239;It is interesting, though, that they used Derek Jakobi, star of the 70's multi part I Claudius.
5240;I love Sword and Sandal films and this is probably my favorite.
5241;There isnt a single moment in the film that I would change.
5242;It has the perfect amount of action and suspense and its very dramatic and moving.
5243;Ridley Scott is a genius.
5244;Gladiator is possibly the greatest action.
5245;adventure film of the past decade, and this is the movie that made Russel Crowe the superstar he is today (much like Top Gun launched Tom Cruise to superstardom).
5246;The action scenes and intense battle footage are some of the most heart.
5247;pounding moments you'll ever see on screen.
5248;the movie features a great plot, thrilling action.
5249;packing fighting, superb acting, great costumes and cinematography, and an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.
5250;The film's score is very fitting for soldiers who are heading off to battle.
5251;The plot is quite elaborate, with several sub.
5252;The acting really takes this film to the next level, though.
5253;like will is portrayed perfectly by Crowe, who took home the Oscar for Best Actor in 2001 for his performance in Gladiator.
5254;Joaquin Phoenix gives a convincing performance as Commodus, a spoiled royal brat and megalomaniac concerned with his perception among the Roman public.
5255;used in this film, but nevertheless gives a good performance as ceasar's daughter.
5256;Maximus hacks and slashes his way to become the top gladiator in the Roman empire and soon finds himself heading back to Rome .
5257;Along the way, Maximus wins the loyalty and respect of his fellow gladiators and the Roman public
5258;Some actors were just born to star in musclebound, action.
5259;i fully recommend Gladiator to any fan of the action.
5260;Ridley Scott provides commentary on both the film and the deleted scenes, and there is information on the production of the film and interviews with Crowe.
5261;There are audio options as well, allowing the viewer to choose between Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 Surround Sound channels.
5262;Marcus Araelius was a real.
5263;life Roman emperor Caligula, who had sexual affairs with each of his three sisters.
5264;I can watch this movie over and over.
5265;phenomenal music by hans and lisa.
5266;It rivals Mel Gibson's movie with a story just as serious and loving as the other.
5267;Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast give performances that are believeable and fun to watch.
5268;I enjoyed watching him be so evil.
5269;Director Ridley Scott adds his touch with exquisite dream sequences and breath.
5270;My jaw almost dropped to the floor when I saw the Roman Collisieum in its' true form.
5271;What a movie, is all that I can say.
5272;I have always been a big fan of all gladiator films, from Tyrone Powers to Richard Burton.
5273;Any actor donning the sandals and metal skirt has my attention.
5274;His strength, power, and ruggedly good looks won me over.
5275;This movie is for you.
5276;drinking friends, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, Gladiator was their final film.
5277;How fitting that they have left us in a popular movie of astonishing scope and splendor.
5278;Gladiator is a savage sword.
5279;sandal spectacle (it revived the genre), a rumination on the politics of then and now, a chronicle of dysfunctional royalty, and a revenge tragedy that turns into a happy family reunion in Heaven.
5280;gladiator, Crowe commands the screen impressively and got an Oscar for it.
5281;There isn't a weak performance in the picture and several are outstanding, including those by Harris and Reed.
5282;scott has an artist's eye for composition and juxtaposition.
5283;He knows when to pull his camera back, when to thrust forward.
5284;The supplements on the three discs are generous and non.
5285;Gladiator is an intimate epic, if there can be such a thing, and a large scale piece of big box office entertainment.
5286;A loyal tough soldier turns into a slave that turns into an amazing gladiator.
5287;So the gladiator has to fight him from captivity and in a final fight.
5288;This is an all around great action movie.
5289;One of the best movies ever.
5290;The blueray is expensive though, this is a classic movie they should make it cheaper.
5291;The movie was shipped very well and I was excited to recieve it.
5292;I love the story, although it is really just a revenge story, but the side characters, the culture and the action make it seem richer.
5293;The music and pace of the action was great on TV.
5294;But just ignore that if you know better and enjoy the flick.
5295;scene extras beautifully crafted with consistency throughout.
5296;The extended edition was a real treat, as well as the fresh commentary by Scott and Crowe.
5297;ray remaster 8/19/10):Although the plotting is a bit uneven at times (with some minor plot holes due to the numerous writers who worked on the project), Gladiator is a brilliant looking spectacle which allows director Ridley Scott to excel.
5298;Scott's brilliantly shot and edited film over comes its slight narrative flaws due to terrific, strong performances from a Oscar caliber cast and the epic production.
5299;Universal (which actually mastered this for Paramount since they own the negative and Paramount only has North American distribution rights) has done a marvelous job.
5300;Include your name and address in the package.
5301;It can now be listed among my favorites.
5302;While the additional minutes add to the story, and make it an even better viewing experience, this movie is also a delight to the ear.
5303;This product was on time, in appeared to be good shape and as for the price it was perfect.
5304;Sending it back today for a refund.
5305;This was a powerfully moving story, stunningly filmed and masterfully paced.
5306;All the major players are excellent.
5307;The extras included are a feast for movie buffs or just someone interested in the making of this film.
5308;There is also added scenes not seen in the theatrical release.
5309;Commodus had light blond hair we are told by Herodian, and was extremely handsome!
5310;But why quibble with details, the story as told is still quite engaging.
5311;Still, this one is worth the money.
5312;This was a good movie in many ways.
5313;I liked the story line, something new, the date.
5314;The action was fast paced, and fun.
5315;But it was still a good movie.
5316;This Ridley Scott epic really holds up over the years.
5317;Russell Crowe was the perfect choice for Maximus.
5318;the casting was really exceptional all around.
5319;But it returns in a majestic way.
5320;This huge producton is one of the best movies of the year, with espectacular sets, a wonderful plot, amazing visual effects and a Russel Crowe like we've never seen before.
5321;Ridley Scott adds another great movie to his sucesseful career.
5322;Gladiator is also one of the possible nominations for the oscars of best suporting actor (Oliver Reed) ,for example.
5323;Gladiator is a movie I saw a couple months ago and it still holds up in my opinion.
5324;Russell Crowe does a great performance as Maximus, a roman general who becomes a slave.
5325;But spectacular battles at the roman colosseum and great acting will keep you riveted right to the end.
5326;But anyone who has a big set, is interested in the roman empire or who just likes great movies should watch this cinematic masterpiece.
5327;Robbie the Robot has more life and emotion than this guy!
5328;The movie had the potential to be a great action film.
5329;Thus the reason it gets 2 stars.
5330;And to tell you the truth, I laughed at the end.
5331;Like Braveheart, this movie touches on the idealistic and poetic.
5332;The fights are very real and powerful.
5333;I think this movie is Russell Crowe's best performance
5334;This one just has a GLADIATOR theme added into it.
5335;I really enjoyed this film.
5336;The acting was very well performed, and it is a visually stunning film.
5337;I think it brings to life the time period better than any other film of its type.
5338;It is a great popcorn munching piece of eye.
5339;i think films such as this are good for capturing a way of life that can be hard for people to conceptualize, and they can also be an excellent impetus for investigating further into historical information.
5340;This movie is one of the summer's better movies because it has emotion all around (except the ending) and very good acting.
5341;The movie starts off with a battle and then introduces the characters, which gets you on the edge of your seat in the very beginning.
5342;Russell Crowe acts with power, as he would've made a good attorney, and the other actors didn't do that bad either and sound persuasive.
5343;The emotion is pretty strong, as you follow the characters along and you're always thinking, Watch your back, he'll chop your dam* head off!
5344;Not only that, the actors fitted their roles perfectly.
5345;The music is good and the f/x are one of the best there ever was!
5346;You can tell a couple ways other than having to watch it and seeing the superior video compared to the original that came about a year ago.
5347;This is a GREAT movie, I highly recommend it.
5348;Every time I catch it on cable I have to watch it.
5349;It's integral to the story, and drives the emotional impact.
5350;An outstanding epic from director Ridley Scott following the fall and rise of a general who ends up a gladiator after the murder of the emperor.
5351;His Maximus is a man of determination, depth, and courage.
5352;The rest of the cast are all well suited to their roles, and the world of Rome and beyond is well captured both by location shooting and special effects.
5353;A triumph for Ridley Scott, and a bloody and rousing film.
5354;I am a music fan, so I enjoyed the focus on the music on the second disc.
5355;There are a couple of deleted scenes with the late Oliver Reed that are worth watching.
5356;I do have the remastered version and it looks and sounds great!
5357;good Spartacus followed by a beautiful Back to the Future trilogy and a superb Psycho.
5358;as for sharpness and real detail, this transfer has gobs of it.
5359;Richard Harris is a lined and wrinkled geezer, and the close.
5360;You will occasionally see trailing.
5361;Oddly, the CGI looks much more believable in the Blu.
5362;sharp script portrays him primarily as someone who /doesn't/ want to be where he is.
5363;Perhaps this is all for the good .
5364;Richard Harris is far more effective .
5365;it reflects a modern view of sexuality that would have made no sense to Mediterranean people.
5366;Gladiator is, overall, an very entertaining and well.
5367;It won because, as with many Best Picture winners, it lavishly combines Spectacle and Sentiment.
5368;Though almost everyone dies, there's still a Happy Ending.
5369;the extras are lavish, including a 3.5 hour (!)
5370;Fourteen years after Gladiator won the Oscar for best film, I decided I'd watch it.
5371;He liked to dress up as Hercules, carrying a club over his shoulder and a lion's hide for a jacket.
5372;Sophia Loren played Lucilla and was easily the bet thing about the movie.
5373;Its been a long time that a movie like this has came out that can really depict the nature of the Roman Empire, with the additional cg elements and the heart pounding at times and soft at other , Hans Zimmer score, this movie is damn near perfect.
5374;Obviously, it's one of the best films ever made, so there's no need to go on and on about that.
5375;This is one of my Russel Crowe favorites.
5376;All the actors are superb, and the story is excellent as well.
5377;The movie illustrates war, love, and honor better than any of its predicesers including Braveheart.
5378;The first scene of the movie is one of the greatest battle scences ever created to this day.
5379;The battle tactics and realities of war were more vivid in this piece than many people were willing to imagine.
5380;I would rate this movie as one of the greatest in the history of moving pictures and suggest this to anyone who would enjoy a great movie.
5381;One of the greatest films of all time.
5382;design,to the stellar performances of a top.
5383;the film starts with a stunning battle and doesen't let up from the time Maximus says on my mark,unleash Hell .
5384;russell Crowe is perfect in the lead role,as an expert warrior with a grieving soul and a deep sense of honor and loyalty.
5385;making turn,and he oozes rugged charisma from every pore.
5386;also great support from Richard Harris and the late,great Oliver Reed.
5387;director Ridley Scott uses his gift for composition and visual flair to great effect,giving each scene a painterly burnish and unforgettable depth,whether it's the after.
5388;well, the less said the better.
5389;A loyal general stands all the suffer of becoming a gladiator and finally won his honour back.
5390;But the making of the film is truly great.
5391;The first battle scene itself alone is worth the price of the video.
5392;The fighting in the Colosseum is also gracefully presented.
5393;I kept rewinding these parts for many times and still enjoy them so far.
5394;You name it, this picture's got it: action, adventure, romance, music, visual affects and scenes.
5395;From the actions scenes with sword and tigers to the visual affects of the coliseum to Russell in a skirt, this movie is pure eye candy.
5396;and definately deserves Best Actor awards.
5397;The story is an epic tale that reminds me of the great classic, Ben Hur.
5398;True, this movie, reminds me of the modern films, the Patriot and Braveheart, this one surpasses both of these in both story telling and action.
5399;I feel that this story although not totally original, is a very compelling and stirs one's emotions.
5400;Through valor and his own abilities, he survives as a gladiator until one day his skill and ability puts him in a position to gain both vengeance and an assured future for Rome.
5401;masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and wonderful acting by those in the movie will make this a classic that will endure as has the classic that this reminds me of, Ben Hur.
5402;I would heartily recommend this to all except the most squeamish.
5403;rated to the smallest bit.
5404;It had EXELLENT graphics, sound and good actors.
5405;The music went perfectly with the movie.
5406;from start to finish, Gladiator is a fantastic epic with a powerful storyline and awesome acting.
5407;Before seeing it, I was skeptical as to it winning the Academy Award.
5408;Excellent casting, acting and directing.
5409;I think it's great this product!It works great!
5410;I seen Gladiator once at the theater I love it!This is the best movie ever!
5411;ridley Scott is the best directed,Russell Crowe is a outstanding actor,and Joaquin Phoenix another outstanding actor too.
5412;i've listen to the DTS and I must say the DTS sound is the best,I can hear the arrow flying around my room and the battle scene was totally awesome is like I'm in the middle of the action.
5413;I love shopping for Blu.
5414;Russell Crowe is super in this movie.
5415;This is the one that me a fan.
5416;I would recommend this to every adult.
5417;i seldom dislike things and if I do I seldom feel compelled to speak on my dislike here in Friends and Favorites.
5418;All the arrows, crisp colors, etc are there.
5419;For all you really avid movie.
5420;notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role.
5421;overall, Gladiator is a great movie that has a little something for everyone.
5422;If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours.
5423;I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.
5424;Gladiator presents to movie goers a refreshing and original piece of story telling.
5425;The plot is easy to follow but contains enough twists and creativity to keep viewers interested.
5426;entertaing and truly superb, Gladiator is a true winner.
5427;Russell Crowe is amazing as Maximus, but the real standout, omitted in earlier reviews, is by Joaquin Phoneix, as the looked down upon Caesar of Rome, Commodus.
5428;Overall, the charcters brought their emotions upon the auidience very well and let me relate to them.
5429;technically, the film acheives greatness all across the board.
5430;from the spectacular visuals, state of the art direction (Ridley Scott), and fitting costumes, to the screenplay and powerfull score (Hans Zimmer).
5431;the many battle scenes are breathtaking and extremly fun to watch.
5432;As you know gladiator won multiple oscars at the 2000 Academy awards inclusing best picture and actor, Joaquin recieved only a nod.
5433;Gladiator is one of the rare films I could watch over and over.
5434;It's definitely one of the greatest films I've ever seen.
5435;The acting was excellent, the scenes were superb, and the history of the times enlightening.
5436;The action as well as the dynamics of the characters were beautifully combined to make this a classic.
5437;I enjoyed everything about this movie.
5438;okay, now we can get on to the bonus disc.
5439;long documentary that goes over the history of the original Roman gladitorial contests, which I found both entertaining and informative.
5440;There's also the interview with composer Hans Zimmer regarding the scoring of the film which I found less than exciting.
5441;Gladiatorial combat is immortalized in this film, the only way it can be: through stunning action sequences and beautiful imagery.
5442;It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.
5443;Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus.
5444;The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better.
5445;since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good.
5446;With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time.
5447;the acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors.
5448;Russell Crowe is now one of the best new (four or five films so far) actors in film.
5449;We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus.
5450;He carries the film in the second.
5451;His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent.
5452;He commands attention just as Crowe does.
5453;but the acting is so good that it seems they are.
5454;now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense.
5455;It has diversity and grandeur.
5456;And every single fight sequence is unique from the others.
5457;This is so much more than just two half.
5458;The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat.
5459;Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive.
5460;During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters.
5461;This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image.
5462;driven action films I've ever seen.
5463;Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue).
5464;Cinematography is skillful and impressive.
5465;the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc.
5466;In this movie Russell crow plays a great roll and he is great at it too.
5467;I thought this movie should get two thumbs up.
5468;I thought it was a marvelous story and adventure about ancient Rome.
5469;the movie was criticly acclaimed and nomiated for may acadamy awards such as best actor in leading role and won and best picture and won.
5470;i saw the movie at the theaiter and bought it the day it came out.
5471;it will make you cry laugh joyful and happy.
5472;it will leave you on the edege of your seat the whole time.
5473;I loved and i hope you do to i t is awsome .
5474;This was impressive all around.
5475;excellent special effectsGripping story and dramaIntense actionBeautiful scoreExcellent acting.
5476;chemistry between characters was perfect.
5477;this is one of the best movies of the past decade.
5478;This is a must and a treasure for any film collection.
5479;The steelbook is also very pretty.
5480;Overall I'm very happy with it.
