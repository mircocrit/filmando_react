I:8465;1;I was suprised that I enjoyed this film as much as I did.
I:8465;2;He did a great job in this film.
I:8465;3;Love, love, love this movie.
I:8465;4;entertainment goes, it isn't bad.
I:8465;5;decent directing, the pace never becomes dull.
I:8465;6;'Cast Away' is an emotional and more relatable step up from 'Lord of the Flies' and your average shipwreck movie.
I:8465;7;consuming and often unpredictable job his long.
I:8465;8;He does his best to squeeze his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) into a schedual so busy around the Holidays that he carries a beeper with him to Christmas dinner.
I:8465;9;In the 80s' especially weve scene Hanks' phenomenal comedic abilities, his obvious talent at drama and the trademark ways about him that, well.
I:8465;10;To tell the truth I thought a big jump in time as you'll see, would ruin the movies' genuine effect.
I:8465;11;the entire movie is summed up in a quiet speach he gives to a friend.
I:8465;12;over him, that he has to stay alive.
I:8465;13;'Cast Away' is a refreshing and meaningful comedy/drama that will be well appreciated in the years to come.
I:8465;14;Having not yet seen CASTAWAY at the time of the Oscars, I was pleased when Crowe won Best Actor.
I:8465;15;Gladiator was one heck of a fun flick.
I:8465;16;And that is another sign of Hanks' great talent.
I:8465;17;He is the most watchable man in film these days.
I:8465;18;An excellent dramatic performance by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;19;His display of fear, dementia, hopelessness, and loneliness is genuine and powerful.
I:8465;20;By the same token, his moments of hope and happiness are both believable and imaginable.
I:8465;21;One of Tom Hanks' best performances, easily.
I:8465;22;This was a great movie, how did I go so long without watching it??
I:8465;23;Great date night movie for the family!
I:8465;24;to come to the right side.
I:8465;25;I feel like the kid that is holding that last piece of candy, you kow, the one who grabs a good thing and runs with it.
I:8465;26;Castaway, was a fully envolved project that has a very good payoff.
I:8465;27;I understand film, and I understand plot.
I:8465;28;But what about those people that he touched, what kind of effect did his life leave, and what things needed to change.
I:8465;29;He had to go back, so we could see the answers.
I:8465;30;He is still on the raft, and the boat is floating beside him, and he can do whatever his heart leads, on the crossroads of his life.
I:8465;31;Definitely and cerebral and well thought of and I gotta fill out how many more words?
I:8465;32;This is an excellent movie.
I:8465;33;So excited it's now on blu ray.
I:8465;34;Tom Hanks always does a great job and this movie won't let you down
I:8465;35;It's one of those movies that grows with you over the years.
I:8465;36;Every time I watch it I learn, notice, reflect on something new.
I:8465;37;The beginning and middle are the best and satisfying parts, the last hour is a bit of a letdown and the ending is left open so the viewer can ponder what road this man has decided to embark on.
I:8465;38;Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance.
I:8465;39;Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime.
I:8465;40;"I love the movie because it showed his survival there
I:8465;41;Someday way in the future we'll look back on all the great actors of this century and Tom Hanks will be one of the greatest!
I:8465;42;I loved it, it is fantastic, Tom Hanks had a tough job in going against Russell Crowe, but lets face it, Hanks has already 2 awards, let's give the new guy a chance.
I:8465;43;The sound is great, the picture even better.
I:8465;44;Cast Away reunites once again the awarded team Zemeckis / Hanks, and once again they made a good film.
I:8465;45;There are several remarkable aspects in Cast Away : overall the cinematography is excellent, the photography is quite realistic and Tom Hank's characterization is also great.
I:8465;46;robert Zemeckis and William Broyles (screenwriter) showed a lot of creativity by including the lovable character Wilson , definitely a character to remember.
I:8465;47;technically Cast Away is almost flawless, like all the movies directed by Robert Zemeckis, and overall the story is very good and realistic.
I:8465;48;at the end of the day, Cast Away is a worthy movie.
I:8465;49;Specially for Tom Hanks' fans or Robert Zemeckis' fans.
I:8465;50;Tom Hanks was brilliant but he played second fiddle to the FedEx logo.
I:8465;51;er, well she played Helen Hunt.
I:8465;52;It was interesting to see how he was going to do things to survive.
I:8465;53;Okay, put on your glasses and look again: That's right.
I:8465;54;There is a space between Cast and Away.
I:8465;55;Imagine if there is anyone else doing the exact same thing to a ball and still make you laugh, at the same time, break your heart.
I:8465;56;This unopened box is his hope.
I:8465;57;Nothing in real life is always satisfying, and Cast Away tells us exactly that.
I:8465;58;At first it mercilessly strips us apart from the civilized materialism, then gives us hope and makes us strong.
I:8465;59;It shows us the majesty of mother nature and the struggle against the odds.
I:8465;60;He achieved his mission of delivering the box back to its owner, (despite it disobeyed the over.
I:8465;61;minded friends at the premier of I forgot what you did last summer .
I:8465;62;perfect for quiet time, or having it on in the background while you work or lounge.
I:8465;63;i do love this movie, though some of the parallels to the evolution of modern man are totally obvious
I:8465;64;tom Hanks, once again, makes a great presentation as a castaway on a deserted isle.
I:8465;65;He keeps himself sane by making a best friend.
I:8465;66;The portion of the movie which takes place on the island is great, although I wish they hadn't glossed over the suicide attempt.
I:8465;67;Tom Hank's best performance yet.
I:8465;68;He really played the part when he and Wilson got separated.
I:8465;69;How one man can play volleyball against his best friend, who is in fact the volleyball at the center of the game itself, is a riddle wrapped inside of an enigma, shipped in a Fedex Box.
I:8465;70;i previously reviewed this movie it is outstanding .
I:8465;71;tom Hanks does and award winning job in this movie .
I:8465;72;I thought this was a good portrayal (though glossed over, I'm sure) of some of the physical and mental issues to be overcome in a situation like this.
I:8465;73;Anyway, it evokes empathy in the viewer, and hopefully a new way of understanding ourselves and the people around us who have all experienced such a diversity of ups and downs .
I:8465;74;I've seen triumphant dramas that had much more substance and a well conceived plot.
I:8465;75;"On each end of the movie is the story of his life back in the ""real world""
I:8465;76;however, the heart of the movie involves Chuck's time on the island, and it is simply Hanks at his best.
I:8465;77;No offense to Russel Crowe, but how he won Best Actor for playing a stoic, monosyllabic gladiator over this performance is one of life's great mysteries.
I:8465;78;For fans of great acting performances, this one is highly recommended.
I:8465;79;It is definitely a thinking movie and comes close to being a romance although there isn't enough time to really develop relationships with other characters.
I:8465;80;A very challenging premise, this movie could have easily turned out to be a boring disappointment, but the challenge was met and the film shines.
I:8465;81;hanks must act with himself and develops a relationship with Wilson on the island, which turns out to be an experience well worth watching and reflecting about.
I:8465;82;Hanks performance is very convincing and this film is a very strong recommendation.
I:8465;83;I've always loved this movie.
I:8465;84;My students enjoyed it very much and it kept the students engaged till we finished the book and watched the Life of Pi movie
I:8465;85;"This movie reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" because of the sentimental themes, the subtle, creative symbols, and the proactive, determined struggle of the main character, which happens to be played by Tom Hanks in both movies."
I:8465;86;the theme of this movie is about what is really important.
I:8465;87;He's constantly working and flying all over the world.
I:8465;88;He exchanges Christmas gifts with his girlfriend at the airport in the car then hands her a wrapped gift which is obviously an engagement ring.
I:8465;89;He tells her to hold on to it until New Years Eve, and promises he'll be with her then.
I:8465;90;She gave him a family heirloom pocket watch with her picture in it.
I:8465;91;he deals best he can with what life dealt him.
I:8465;92;He is resourceful and exercises initiative.
I:8465;93;The bulk of the movie, his stay on the island, is very unique because he is the only human being shown, there is no music, yet it never ceases to be fascinating.
I:8465;94;A great turning point and memorable scene of the movie is when he bravely decides to voyage off the island on a raft he constructed.
I:8465;95;He finally delivered it in person when he got back.
I:8465;96;Saving this package for that purpose shows his determination and hope for the future.
I:8465;97;Just like in Forrest Gump, this is a subtle, curious action.
I:8465;98;He leaves a note saying the package saved his life.
I:8465;99;The package was of no tangible use to him like the contents of the other packages but it was the hope that he would be able to deliver it that saved his life.
I:8465;100;A pretty, vivacious woman drives up and tells him the names of each of the roads and where they lead.
I:8465;101;The messages of the movie are that close relationships are more important than working and that we've got to do the best we can with the cards life deals us.
I:8465;102;What an outstanding performance by Tom Hanks where he actually lost a great number of pounds to make his character seem so real.
I:8465;103;This is a good and entertaining movie that I have enjoyed watching several times.
I:8465;104;This movie keeps you interested even though the dialog has been kept to a minimum as he gets stranded on an island and he is alone.
I:8465;105;I liked a lot this movie, it is amazing what Tom Hanks had to put up with in order to get realism to his character.
I:8465;106;The airplane crash scene is spectacular.
I:8465;107;They either find it completely engrossing or mind.
I:8465;108;I'm kind of in the middle.
I:8465;109;I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.
I:8465;110;the film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED.
I:8465;111;He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.
I:8465;112;For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.
I:8465;113;He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.
I:8465;114;This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.
I:8465;115;if I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.
I:8465;116;anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.
I:8465;117;Always a good blockbuster film from the past to watch.
I:8465;118;Tom Hanks is always a good decision no matter the genre.
I:8465;119;Many have written great reviews of this awesome movie.
I:8465;120;This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.
I:8465;121;There is a great deal of spiritual symbolism on a deeper level.
I:8465;122;I surmise that viewers that think along these lines have never spent great stretches of time alone without human contact.
I:8465;123;Chuck Logan has learned something new though.
I:8465;124;He has been transformed by his experience and has learned how to listen to some voice deep inside instead of rushing around like a Fed Ex mad man.
I:8465;125;tHE WHALE:Whats with the whale and the spraying of the water.
I:8465;126;When a whale comes as close to you as was accurately portrayed in this movie, raises its head out of the water, and its eye looks in yours and your eyes look into its eye, you can only come to one conclusion: you are looking into the eye of an intelligent and sentient being that is quite capable of staying with Hanks.
I:8465;127;Sailors have reported these experiences with whales time and again.
I:8465;128;Yes, that symbol saved his life but also Wilson saved his life, Kelly saved his life, the watch saved his life, and Chuck Logan saved his life by recognizing his powerlessness and transforming his life.
I:8465;129;The island scene's were not only well shot but Hank's performance was truly wonderful .
I:8465;130;what does it say when the 2nd best performance in a movie is done by a volleyball
I:8465;131;From director,Robert Zemeckis comes Cast AwayThis is Gilligan's Island with a Hanks/Remeckis touch.
I:8465;132;this is a beautiful piece of film.
I:8465;133;the script isn't great,but the entire movie is great!Tom Hanks is absolutley outstanding as Chuck,with a great cast.
I:8465;134;There is very little dialogue on the island,but the visuals are excellent.
I:8465;135;alan Silvestri,the composer,did a wonderful job on the soundtrack,fair enough he only composed 10 minutes of music.
I:8465;136;in my own opinion of viewing this movie,I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8465;137;it was truely an excellent piece of work.
I:8465;138;Coconut milk is a natural laxative.
I:8465;139;Tom Hanks is one of those actors who can play a wide variety of rolls.
I:8465;140;Although it may sound interesting, this tale of courage, fate, love and most of all survival is more moving and touching than any other movie.
I:8465;141;this tale is truly touching and amazing how such a terrible accident can really change your life completely.
I:8465;142;The case was in perfect condition and it played perfectly.
I:8465;143;My son has seen this movie several times but wanted it for a Christmas gift.
I:8465;144;It was one of his favorite gifts.
I:8465;145;Tom Hanks is so good in this.
I:8465;146;When she went back to school she took it with her, so when she comes home and bring it with her we enjoy it together.
I:8465;147;Great story line and very much inspiring.
I:8465;148;Cast Away is a solid, well done movie.
I:8465;149;The special effects of the plane crash are heart stopping, and Tom Hanks is wonderful as the main (and really only) character.
I:8465;150;In fact I enjoyed the movie all the way until he got rescued.
I:8465;151;again, I enjoyed this movie overall.
I:8465;152;this film is almost entirely a solo effort by Tom Hanks, and he does a fantastic job of being a time.
I:8465;153;the acting is absolutely top.
I:8465;154;The storyline is great, and the combination of acting, story, and music rates a solid 5 stars.
I:8465;155;5 stars all the way!
I:8465;156;I've watched almost every movie that Tom Hanks has starred in, I think he's that great.
I:8465;157;And all that dieting he did.
I:8465;158;Hanks salvages the movie and makes it watchable with his exceptional talent, but not much more.
I:8465;159;Tom Hanks gives one of his most commendable performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed.
I:8465;160;face action epic adventure which will be appreciated by all age groups above teenagers (inclusive).
I:8465;161;Starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, this movie has the smallest cast ever, I think, since most of the movie focuses on Tom Hanks.
I:8465;162;i give this film 4 stars.
I:8465;163;Kick back, put your feet up, tuck under a nice electric blanket, and turn up the volume, cos' you'll be casted away till the end.
I:8465;164;This is a great movie about adapting to and overcoming adversity, determining what is important in life and self reliance.
I:8465;165;It was a wonderful movie to me.
I:8465;166;Picture is very captivating and Tom Hanks really draws you into the scenes he is going through makes you recognize just how one would try to survive.
I:8465;167;This was an amazing movie .
I:8465;168;Hanks is clearly one of the most talented actors ever (The Green Mile, Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan), and his versatility is unparallelled.
I:8465;169;Beautiful scenery, a very realistic plot, and masterful editing make this movie outstanding.
I:8465;170;with a little imagination and an open mind, you may appreciate the movie for what it was intended: Cast Away is hilariously funny, crushingly tragic, occasionally shocking, and above all, a celebration of the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.
I:8465;171;the woman artist on the ranch, the former lover now married to someone else, the widowed best friend, even his relationship with his job.
I:8465;172;It's a movie about a personal journey that leads the viewer nowhere.
I:8465;173;The trailer shows the best of this film.
I:8465;174;While the ending works just fine for me and is very clear and actually very satisfying, it was what was left out that bothered me .
I:8465;175;Regardless, the movie definitely held my interest, is visually fascinating, effectively portrays the tenacity of life, and is mostly well.
I:8465;176;Thanks for reading my thoughts!
I:8465;177;Tom Hanks proves his dramatic acting flair in this very suspensful drama.
I:8465;178;I enjoyed it all the way through.
I:8465;179;The writing, photography, acting, all top notch.
I:8465;180;That wasthe main reason I bought the film which I had viewed many times in the past.
I:8465;181;Cast Away is something rare and special in Hollywood.
I:8465;182;It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it.
I:8465;183;That's okay too, you know.
I:8465;184;He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer.
I:8465;185;He deserves all of the attention and respect.
I:8465;186;Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho.
I:8465;187;This movie defied all odds.
I:8465;188;This is a great, up.
I:8465;189;lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this.
I:8465;190;This is a Hollywood classic.
I:8465;191;This film is the way it should be.
I:8465;192;The cinematography and directing here, unsurpassed.
I:8465;193;Got to give Tom Hanks alot of credit for his role in this picture, this two time best actor winner at the Oscars is in top form here.
I:8465;194;Cast Away ranks among some of my all time favorites.
I:8465;195;Conquest Of Paradise, which also has some nice lush, tropical cinematography.
I:8465;196;Cast Away, is a film about survival, the human spirit, the Earth's wonders, desperation, and strength.
I:8465;197;All these elements provide us a nourshing and insightful look into the harshness of true survival.
I:8465;198;Excellent movie, it should have won best picture, and it should have won Hanks another Oscar.
I:8465;199;My family loved this movie.
I:8465;200;We saw it when it first came out and really liked it.
I:8465;201;My kids are finally old enough to be able to watch as well and they really liked it.
I:8465;202;the movie started out well.
I:8465;203;i do agree that Tom Hanks did a good job with this movie.
I:8465;204;The fact that the film starts off with so much human activity and communication which leads into Tom Hanks on an island by himself with hardly any voices being heard at all makes this a really great story.
I:8465;205;I love everything about this movie.
I:8465;206;I would love to see it again.
I:8465;207;I recommend this film to just about everyone.
I:8465;208;Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie.
I:8465;209;It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time.
I:8465;210;Tom Hanks give an explosive and nearly solo.
I:8465;211;performance in this riveting film from Robert Zimeckis, the Oscar.
I:8465;212;"winning director of ""Forrest Gump""A simple plot, a Fed."
I:8465;213;"big, whoop, it's so much more than personal survival, constant symbolism, underlying meanings of the everything from the title to Fed Ex's motto ""The World on Time""."
I:8465;214;ball painted with blood named Wilson, but just watch the film again, and find more to it.
I:8465;215;helen Hunt gives a superb performance as Hanks' wife.
I:8465;216;This started out to be a good, regular movie .
I:8465;217;and Tom Hanks was a handsome administrator of a nationally known company.
I:8465;218;He's an excellent actor, but as the movie progressed he regressed into a savage from a jungle.
I:8465;219;showing he is the ultimate survivor.
I:8465;220;thank goodness, he switched to playing character actors after that ordeal which suits him better anyway, for he is a good actor.
I:8465;221;BUT Hanks grabbed me from the first scene of this powerful movie, holding me captive until the bittersweet ending.
I:8465;222;He's a fine actor and was superb in this role.
I:8465;223;The photography and visuals are excellent when they follow Chuck's progress as he does everything humanly possible in order to survive.
I:8465;224;His physical and mental regression are heart.
I:8465;225;"breaking to see, yet the film has its uplifting moments when he makes ""friends"" with a Wilson volleyball, using it as a ""human"" sounding board to keep his sanity."
I:8465;226;"The scenes when he talks to the volleyball look rather ""insane,"" but are the few touches of humor in the film."
I:8465;227;"the scene where Chuck ""loses"" Wilson touched my heart
I:8465;228;By that time in the movie, Director Robert Zemeckis's wisdom in choosing stark island scenes to emphasize Chuck's solitude were remarkably evident.
I:8465;229;played brilliantly by the fine actress Helen Hunt.
I:8465;230;still waiting for him after four years when everyone thought he was dead?You will learn the answers to those questions as you view this film that is brought vividly to life through Hank's realistic portrayal and the director's keen insight into this character.
I:8465;231;The sound effects and rhythmic camera moves capture Chuck's emerging survival skills to perfection.
I:8465;232;"I agree with the New York Post review: Tom Hanks ""."
I:8465;233;"gives one of the towering screen performances of all time."""
I:8465;234;He watches very closely to spot something new each time.
I:8465;235;Tom Hanks delivers another exceptional and emotional performance (Don't worry I'll back that up).
I:8465;236;He leaves for his plane exclaiming, I'll be right back!
I:8465;237;The second act, where the only life you see for a while is Hanks (I don't even think you see a bird or anything else until that whale), is the most compelling and memorable part of the film.
I:8465;238;His relationship with Wilson the volleyball is more believable than the one he has with Helen Hunt (there is also more chemistry between the two).
I:8465;239;When Hanks is the cast away the movie is great.
I:8465;240;half of this film is good, and the other part is just so slow.
I:8465;241;Gilligan's Island was a cute show, but CASTAWAY is the real thing and a great movie.
I:8465;242;The Gilligan's Island jingle could have gone something like this:The plane set down in the ocean somewhere, Near an uncharted Pacific Isle, With Tom Hanks, and Wilson too, the millionaire, Tom Hanks, The movie star (Tom Hanks), the Professor (Hanks), and Hanks again, Here on Tom Hanks' Isle!So much for my parodic attempt to be funny, but it is true.
I:8465;243;If you like Tom Hanks, whom I do, you will love this movie.
I:8465;244;"They must have paid a good nickel to secure her services, but she certainly made the most of her part
I:8465;245;In fact, Tom had a ball with this little fellow and you will be impressed with his performance.
I:8465;246;the movie reveals to us the importance of the human relationship.
I:8465;247;The movie answers these questions, and even brings God into the picture.
I:8465;248;Thus, the movie deals with some very real and delicate human issues, issues that we cannot so easily cast away !
I:8465;249;the Featurette on Wilson is funny and surprizingly informative.
I:8465;250;but the best extra was watching the interview with Tom Hanks.
I:8465;251;He really presents himself in a way that makes you want to watch any other Tom Hanks movie again.
I:8465;252;and although I really liked the movie and enjoyed watching it without the Director's Commentary Track, having the Commentary Track was great for this movie.
I:8465;253;It was well organized to fit the what part you were watching and with so much quiet time during the movie it helps to understand what they were thinking when they made it.
I:8465;254;the main difference between the two is that 2001 has intrigue, meaning, poetry, and vision.
I:8465;255;This movie certainly a worthy addition the that genre, however.
I:8465;256;Hanks is really better than this .
I:8465;257;The only thing good about the film is the great computer graphics.
I:8465;258;The acting is more humorous than serious or dramatic.
I:8465;259;I laughed more than anything watching this.
I:8465;260;He's peeing into the ocean.
I:8465;261;Castaway (with Tom Hanks) was a good movie until the end, when it grabs the brass ring of greatness (in my humble opinion).
I:8465;262;if you have ever realized you let go of a great love, then you understood what was great about it.
I:8465;263;You have the chance to take that realization, growth, and self.
I:8465;264;awareness to your next relationship, making it worlds better that the first.
I:8465;265;it takes courage to move on and trust that the future contains unknown miracles.
I:8465;266;Ironically, that courage may be the thing your next love finds most attractive about you.
I:8465;267;i absolutely adore the last scene.
I:8465;268;He is literally at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere.
I:8465;269;But it doesn't really matter because we know he will continue to find the courage to move on.
I:8465;270;Afterwards, she can no longer see his face as clearly as she can see his heart.
I:8465;271;Tom Hanks is great, Helen Hunt is great, too, even for a small part.
I:8465;272;This movie is interesting to the last moment.
I:8465;273;The plot is terrific and the plane crash scene is so believable that you think you are there.
I:8465;274;As usual, Tom Hanks makes his character so believable that you wish the story would go on to more episodes.
I:8465;275;Due to the Holywood nature of the project I also expected wild adventure scenes and the movie to be a generally pleasant affair.
I:8465;276;Part two, he crashes in the pacific ocean.
I:8465;277;The movie works incredibly well as a mood piece and establishes a huge sense of desolation and loneliness.
I:8465;278;Hanks puts in a subtle performance that for the most part relies on body language rather than expansive monologues.
I:8465;279;The film is also very real which definitley helps add to the pervading sense of loss.
I:8465;280;The whole third act is a dissapointment.
I:8465;281;Throughout the entire film Hanks does a great job so it is a shame to see him reverting to his usual I have to get home to my wife type of character taht he has done about three million times before.
I:8465;282;These are minor quibbles to another wise great movie.
I:8465;283;Castway is real and the sense of desperation and loneliness it creates is uncommon in movies of this scope.
I:8465;284;But what a great movie to un.
I:8465;285;length and the premise that it's really a one.
I:8465;286;As always sold acting by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;287;But this is a tough one.
I:8465;288;The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences.
I:8465;289;Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.
I:8465;290;He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143.
I:8465;291;His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real.
I:8465;292;They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.
I:8465;293;"Zemeckis uses Startling Camerawork and Brilliant use of Sounds and Silence to create this Landmark film, in my opinion
I:8465;294;Cast Away is a great survival movie that also promotes Wilson sports gear and Fedex.
I:8465;295;The daring escape from the island he is marooned on after four years there has some great cinematography of an ocean going freighter juxtaposed against his tiny raft.
I:8465;296;This wonderfully entertaining film features an acting performance unparalleled in the annals of cinema.
I:8465;297;Clearly, it is Wilson who squeezed an excellent performance out of Mr. Hanks and was the linchpin of the entire zillion dollar production.
I:8465;298;Perhaps for future roles he will receive the recognition from his peers that he so richly deserves.
I:8465;299;I saw this movie a couple of weeks a go and its great!
I:8465;300;well u know the rest.
I:8465;301;that is, that life in unpredictable.
I:8465;302;His job, time, working, and lastly his girlfriend/hope for fiance (Helen Hunt).
I:8465;303;This technical part of the movie is very interesting.
I:8465;304;After seeing his ex fiance married with kids he realizes he just has to go on surviving, as a well written monologue at the end points out.
I:8465;305;i like that at the end, he is able to deliver one of the Fed Ex boxes he found after the crash.
I:8465;306;It belongs to a lady that started out the movie sending art to her husband overseas, whose cheating on her.
I:8465;307;Tom's character has to go through a lot but the ending really does hint at the fact that with the artist lady, is where he was always meant to be.
I:8465;308;Excellent movie, I believe that this is another one of Tom Hanks great movies.
I:8465;309;It is another brick in the wall of a solid career in entertaining millions of people throughout the world.
I:8465;310;This is one to share with the family.
I:8465;311;Everyone who has seen the trailer, I suppose, knows that he makes it back at the end of the film .
I:8465;312;There are two scenes in the movie in which Hanks' character looks in each of the cardinal directions.
I:8465;313;This is a great movie, it shows the determination and how I feel a lot of things would actually happen
I:8465;314;It was packaged very nicely as well (Bubble wrap and Fragile being written on the package).
I:8465;315;I am very satisfied with the service as well as the product I was given.
I:8465;316;It's a great movie that I would recommend to many.
I:8465;317;It had exactly ZERO of the elements that make a good flick.
I:8465;318;He's on the island, he figures out how to do some stuff and then, BAM, it's four years later.
I:8465;319;I will begin by saying I am a Tom Hanks fan and he does a marvelous job in this film as far as acting is concerned and I like Helen Hunt dispite her, nothing more than, cameo appearance.
I:8465;320;I thought the film had a great deal of unexplored potential.
I:8465;321;tail success of the Survivor series and with Hanks in the lead was guaranteed a wide audience.
I:8465;322;Hanks is popular with all age groups from teens to those over 50 years of age.
I:8465;323;This is rare in deed for todays Hollywood!
I:8465;324;A classic movie that I appreciate more than when it was first released.
I:8465;325;Exemplifies the resiliency of the human spirit, despite years of hardship and loneliness.
I:8465;326;The human spirit endures even through the bittersweet ending.
I:8465;327;however, the movie works brilliantly as a documentary.
I:8465;328;(I nearly felt blisters on my fingers by the time that he got his first fire!)
I:8465;329;Because if it does, this fine documentary will be soon showing on the Discovery Channel.
I:8465;330;Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt are very good.
I:8465;331;"Look how well the series ""Lost"" is doing because of the great acting and the suspense of what is on the island."
I:8465;332;He is an amazing actor.
I:8465;333;The story is very compelling.
I:8465;334;excellent work by Tom Hanks, almost always guaranteed.
I:8465;335;One of the best I've seen.
I:8465;336;It was a great great movie about survival and determination.
I:8465;337;I can't say this boosts my confidence in air travel, however, CAST AWAY is thoroughly entertaining!
I:8465;338;Around Christmas he returns from Russia and joins Kelly's family for a close, friendly Christmas dinner, but then gets called to a location past the South Pacific.
I:8465;339;later, he is lean, with toughened feet and a longstanding relationship with Wilson, a hunk of a porta.
I:8465;340;"he says he is ""happy she was with him on the island"" and acknowledges her picture and memory were important to his survival."
I:8465;341;and he feels it's important to move on with his life.
I:8465;342;the commentary on the second disk is interesting.
I:8465;343;it's fascinating to contemplate how we would do in a situation like that.
I:8465;344;I have seen this movie several times, and it continues to be a good movie.
I:8465;345;Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, so this is another movie that is a must see.
I:8465;346;There is a stretch in the movie that there little to no speaking, and Tom Hanks does a great job with his body language to tell us a story.
I:8465;347;Only a great actor can pulled that off with the grace and skill that only Tom Hanks can.
I:8465;348;Anything you can imagine happening on a deserted island, that's what.
I:8465;349;Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, if it were anybody else then it would have been a terrible joke.
I:8465;350;the most boringest movie ever.
I:8465;351;i call a great hitchcockean thriller.
I:8465;352;This is a great movie.
I:8465;353;an adventure story, but more.
I:8465;354;A lot of good moments.
I:8465;355;The theme music will stay with you.
I:8465;356;I liked the ending which was a bit hard to figure out.
I:8465;357;there are over 400 other reviews on this site for this film, so I will spare you another detailed summary of the plot.
I:8465;358;She still has all of his stuff from the unsuccessful search, and his car, and yet he must go to her.
I:8465;359;This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen.
I:8465;360;The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality.
I:8465;361;He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays.
I:8465;362;what's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity.
I:8465;363;But this film has it all: utterly believable characters, a fine script, and more action than most bash.
I:8465;364;ups could ever manage on their best days.
I:8465;365;To see a man we come to care about deeply beat the odds and survive makes for the most rewarding viewing.
I:8465;366;absolutely stunning and highly recommended.
I:8465;367;This movie hammers home the idea, to me at least, that Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar.
I:8465;368;In this film, it's because of a plane crash in the pacific.
I:8465;369;The similarities between Cast Away and JVTV were numerous, with lots of bits of symbolism all through the film.
I:8465;370;Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film, which hardly got a second glance by critics.
I:8465;371;a. film, and is very dramatic and wonderful.
I:8465;372;I would have liked more special features, so I didn't give it 5 stars.
I:8465;373;Tom Hanks does an awesome job in this movie!
I:8465;374;Love it!Great lesson in this movie about what is important in life!
I:8465;375;With director Robert Zemeckis teaming up with actor Tom Hanks for the first time since Forrest Gump, movie fans had high expectations for this movie, and were not dissapointed.
I:8465;376;It is when Noland must take an unexpected delivery overseas that the action starts.
I:8465;377;He must now find a way to survive alone, with no hope of being rescued.
I:8465;378;noland must use what he has to survive, including the packages that were on the plane.
I:8465;379;the screenplay is excellent, and Hanks had no trouble keeping the audience captivated for the two and a half hour long movie.
I:8465;380;Critics and fans will certainly agree that Cast Away is a masterpiece.
I:8465;381;I really enjoy Tom Hanks in all of his movies , and this one is one of the best he has made .
I:8465;382;Has always been one of my favorites, I can watch it over and over.
I:8465;383;An all around good watch.
I:8465;384;tom Hanks is a great actor, and proves it yet again with his outstanding performance in Cast Away.
I:8465;385;In fact, all of the acting is solid and convincing, helping to flesh out characters I actually cared about.
I:8465;386;i really enjoy movies with a survival theme where I can place myself into the shoes of the protagonist, imagining what he or she feels and is thinking.
I:8465;387;Hanks does an outstanding job of drawing in the viewer into just this type of experience.
I:8465;388;Of all the great movies I've seen this year, Cast Away is easily the best.
I:8465;389;There are so many little touches that it will take multiple viewings to catch them all, and maybe a lifetime to understand them.
I:8465;390;There is a good chance that Tom Hanks will win yet another Oscar for Best Actor, because this is his best work ever.
I:8465;391;He literally has to carry the entire film by himself, and he does it perfectly.
I:8465;392;Emotional, insightful, a very good movie.
I:8465;393;This is great movie and my Tom Hanks favorite movie.
I:8465;394;It's a good family movie that shows the depth of the human spirit and the desire to survive.
I:8465;395;It is also very funny at times and very sad at times.
I:8465;396;I will recommande to all my friends!
I:8465;397;And I will see this movie again!
I:8465;398;I saw this movie in theaters when it came out years ago and really enjoyed it.
I:8465;399;Redbox didn't have it either so I came to Amazon since I have Prime and found this for a good price.
I:8465;400;A couple of days later, it was here and we got to watch it and have watched it another time since.
I:8465;401;Good movie and good service from Amazon!
I:8465;402;There is no need to talk about this film, I just watched it again today and I loved it all over again.
I:8465;403;great scoreHave you bought it yet?
I:8465;404;Cast Away is very Hollywood.
I:8465;405;Anyway, the film is good.
I:8465;406;Cast Away, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, is one of the best pictures of 2000.
I:8465;407;Cast Away is a feircely imaginative movie, completly gripping and beautiful.
I:8465;408;We enjoyed this film as much the second time as we did when we saw it at the theater earlier in the year.
I:8465;409;It is definitely worth the time and money.
I:8465;410;I've seen this movie a couple of time and it is one of Tom Hank's best.
I:8465;411;One can make a case that Cast Away was Robert Zemeckis' last great film.
I:8465;412;Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well.
I:8465;413;It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.
I:8465;414;watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up.
I:8465;415;The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions.
I:8465;416;And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly.
I:8465;417;Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.
I:8465;418;I actually give the movie a 3.1/2, but I would rather give it four than three.
I:8465;419;Hanks's time on the island is where he truly shines.
I:8465;420;A little better script towards the end of the movie would have made such a difference in turning a very good movie into a great movie.
I:8465;421;Helen Hunt is given a somewhat thankless role, but is believable enough to at least make something happen.
I:8465;422;My movie arrived in great condition.
I:8465;423;It was a Christmas present for my fiance and he loved it, considering it is his favorite movie and he did not have it.
I:8465;424;Fast delivery as well :)
I:8465;425;A great movie with one of cinemas all.
I:8465;426;How Tom Hanks did not win the Oscar for best Best Actor is beyond me.
I:8465;427;Tom Hanks is excellent in this movie.
I:8465;428;I am very pleased with the price!!
I:8465;429;anyway, Cast Away was great.
I:8465;430;a new concept in cinematography proving that their is something new under the sun.
I:8465;431;It was amazing how one man alone could go through such peril by himself.
I:8465;432;I think the funniest thing was I cried about Wilson.
I:8465;433;One of our all time favorites.
I:8465;434;It is a great family movie.
I:8465;435;very affordable for blue ray and its a great movie!!!!!!!!
I:8465;436;tom hanks did an incredible job in this movie .
I:8465;437;Just wanted to add my thumbs up for this wonderful movie.
I:8465;438;So many good things about it .
I:8465;439;the scenery, the music, the emotions conveyed so exquisitely.
I:8465;440;I don't love Helen Hunt normally, but she was outstanding.
I:8465;441;Perfect blend of suspense, despair, heartbreak, and most of all, hope.
I:8465;442;A movie you can watch over and over.
I:8465;443;We are always looking for something that will appeal to the adults and kids (ages 12 and 8) in our family.
I:8465;444;Whats so great about this film is that one actor can carry the whole thing on his shoulders and make you give a damn.
I:8465;445;Hanks is a wonderfully talented actor who proves that here with what I believe to be his finest performance to date.
I:8465;446;Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive.
I:8465;447;Hanks proves that he is one of our generations finest leading men and this film goes down as one of my favorites for that very reason.
I:8465;448;Though this story may be tried and true, it's Hank's acting that give this film the punch that it has.
I:8465;449;This movie was very good.
I:8465;450;He survives for years and finally goes back home.
I:8465;451;Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.
I:8465;452;"You don't just watch this movie
I:8465;453;disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.
I:8465;454;"Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it
I:8465;455;Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.
I:8465;456;When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.
I:8465;457;The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.
I:8465;458;It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.
I:8465;459;overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.
I:8465;460;"Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet
I:8465;461;This movie is a real tear.
I:8465;462;"jerker
I:8465;463;Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart.
I:8465;464;"i love Wilson
I:8465;465;An extraordinary, silent performance, emotionally captivating while growing physically more gaunt.
I:8465;466;But Act 1 is undoubtedly saved by the stunning crash sequence.
I:8465;467;Act 2 is no fun at all.
I:8465;468;Essentially, it is a long chain of 'oooo, that's clever!'
I:8465;469;moments, as Hanks solves various survival problems in an amusing way.
I:8465;470;one will care, and Cast Away is going to be huge in the UK, as it has been in the US.
I:8465;471;Tom Hanks in this movie is the best when he is by himself on the island.
I:8465;472;His acting range is great for this role.
I:8465;473;If you have not seen this movie, you must give it a chance!
I:8465;474;It is a must see!
I:8465;475;Movie arrived on time and in very good condition as advertised.
I:8465;476;I will have many hours of enjoyment from this product.
I:8465;477;I like this movie because of Tom Hanks.
I:8465;478;Even though there is very little dialog while he is on the island he does a great job of entertaining us and giving us a feel of what it would have been like.
I:8465;479;Like I said, I mostly like the movie because Tom Hanks is such a good actor.
I:8465;480;Instead of churning out another predictible car chasing, bowel movement jokes, gratuitious sex, hollywood piece of junk, Robert Zemekis has created a masterpiece.
I:8465;481;This is a case of a director counting on a superb actor to make the story compelling.
I:8465;482;It takes tremendous talent to keep the audience interested when a good portion of the movie has very little dialogue and has little music.
I:8465;483;Translation: This movie deals with real life.
I:8465;484;it's completely refreshing to see a film like this that isn't preoccupied with providing the audience what I call eye candy and instead concentrated on presenting not just a film, but an experience.
I:8465;485;Nothing of great importance as to character and plot is discussed, you just have to listen to that Foley .
I:8465;486;This collaboration between director Robert Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks is, in my mind, virtually flawless and a totally compelling viewing experience.
I:8465;487;Zemeckis(and Hanks) are asking us to follow a story that asks us to follow the transformation of a man whose whole life revolves around punctuality and now finds himself with all the time in the world.
I:8465;488;Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.
I:8465;489;"The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count ""Wilson"" the volleyball, are just masterful."
I:8465;490;Hanks uses his consummate skills as an actor to pull us in and never lets go.
I:8465;491;Though this film was a box office success it received something of a lukewarm critical response.
I:8465;492;We really enjoyed watching Castaway.
I:8465;493;It is a beautifully photographed story, drawing out the unforgiving beauty of the island in all its moods.
I:8465;494;The photography also draws the viewer into the story by including items in the frame that the viewer is allowed to discover.
I:8465;495;One striking scene is when Chuck first ascends to the top of the island and through the panoramic scene we share his discovery that he is alone and there is no other land on the horizon.
I:8465;496;Now that I have seen the extra features unavailable in the theater, I have an even greater appreciation for how the cinematographer achieved this.
I:8465;497;it is a terrific acting job by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;498;He carries a tremendous load in this movie.
I:8465;499;His demonstration of the many stages his character experiences is convincing.
I:8465;500;the score and audio are wonderfully understated.
I:8465;501;We finally hear some quiet but stirring music as Hanks escapes the island, and it is so expressive of the relief and freedom he must be feeling because we are experiencing it with him.
I:8465;502;it is a well written story of human transformation.
I:8465;503;At the beginning of the story we meet Chuck, the Fed Ex legend, devoted to his job and the clock.
I:8465;504;The viewers experienced the process with him, and we leave the story with our own opportunities for reflection and hope.
I:8465;505;I believe the film deserved more.
I:8465;506;Having seen a great Federal Express commercial during the Superbowl which was a take off on this movie, I decided I would finally see it.
I:8465;507;This movie is well known as a tale of survival when Hanks washes up on an uninhabited tropical island.
I:8465;508;Rather, it takes a great will to survive as well as an ability to hang on to the edge of sanity to keep going and ultimately be rescued.
I:8465;509;To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie.
I:8465;510;That's quite an intriguing situation.
I:8465;511;I am a huge fan of his and thought he did a tromendous job in this film.
I:8465;512;I can't say enough for Tom Hanks, he is truly a brilliant actor.
I:8465;513;I knew you were alive. . . I always loved you What is that supposed to mean?
I:8465;514;You knew I was alive and loved me when you got married and had a kid within 1 year after I disappeared?
I:8465;515;Fast service and a great movie.
I:8465;516;Tom Hanks was exceptional in the moive.
I:8465;517;His emotions and his character held you every step of the way.
I:8465;518;Actually the first half isn't bad and if there had been ANY development of the plot in the second half, it could have been a good movie, possibly even a great movie!What this film represents most is the tremendous lost opportunity that was suggested in the beginning.
I:8465;519;rating this a 2 is fair and honest, and any higher rating would do a disservice to any potential viewers.
I:8465;520;good movie the first time but after having to watch it 4 times it gets kinda boring.
I:8465;521;great movie good priceI had looked everywhere for this movie Amazon was the only one that had it and could get it to me in a timely manner
I:8465;522;I was very surprised to see such striking criticisms of the movie by viewers here.
I:8465;523;I thought Cast Away was great, another outstanding performance in a long line of great performances by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;524;This was the best movie of 2000 in my opinion.
I:8465;525;If you are the big Tom Hanks fan this is a must see.
I:8465;526;This movie is very emotional and a great watch if you're up for a good cry or if you just need to get some perspective in life.
I:8465;527;Overall, a very good movie.
I:8465;528;In Cable Guy everyone expected another Ace Ventura and instead got a wonderful black comedy.
I:8465;529;For almost an hour we share the island with Chuck and a ball named Wilson.
I:8465;530;While it might sound odd it is really very captivating and entertaining.
I:8465;531;The interview with Charlie Rose is curious but gives you an idea of the time and effort it takes for even Tom Hanks to develop a project and get it filmed.
I:8465;532;Personally, I think that Hanks was brilliant and the storyline was original and refreshing.
I:8465;533;To dismiss this film is to dismiss both a well crafted and entertaining movie and a superlative performace by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;534;i liked this movie and, surprisingly.
I:8465;535;since i'm a big fan of music.
I:8465;536;i really enjoyed the huge section while he is on the island where no music was being played.
I:8465;537;it gave a great sense of being away from civilization.
I:8465;538;Great work Tom Hanks for taking advantage of that and making a few extra bucks!my one complaint with the movie comes at the end.
I:8465;539;but all in all, the film was great.
I:8465;540;Select it and the director of the movie will tell you what was in the hidden Package.
I:8465;541;Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever.
I:8465;542;this movie you can watch over and over.
I:8465;543;If the movie kept you on the island more and at least had a satisfying ending it could have been perfect.
I:8465;544;Amazing storyline, although a smidge far fetched, is believable.
I:8465;545;Prepare for an emotional roller.
I:8465;546;coaster ride and to be immersed in the film.
I:8465;547;you just about feel like you're right along side Chuck Noland and Wilson.
I:8465;548;"It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic ""man versus nature"" theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization."
I:8465;549;His four.year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie.
I:8465;550;tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling.
I:8465;551;Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone.
I:8465;552;provoking, veracious and very affecting.
I:8465;553;zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan.
I:8465;554;We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense.
I:8465;555;But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was.
I:8465;556;going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).
I:8465;557;cola commercial was pure Spielberg.
I:8465;558;Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch.
I:8465;559;An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.
I:8465;560;"it was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again ""Survivor"" fans."
I:8465;561;"The washed up metal ""sail"" was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the ""discovery"" of tool."
I:8465;562;"making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle
I:8465;563;There some good things in Cast Away take Tom Hank's performance for example but that it's it.
I:8465;564;Gladiator was entertaining and the effects were great but the acting was standard and average.
I:8465;565;Cast Away DOES have incredible special effects but it's not makes the film amazing, it was the genuine emotional content and Tom Hanks' outstanding performance!
I:8465;566;Enjoy your life and Enjoy this film!
I:8465;567;Cast Away is a good film, but not one that stays with for long.
I:8465;568;I thought Tom was superb in his character as someone who alway holds it together, and then all of sudden he losses it.
I:8465;569;He and his imaginary friend Wilson.
I:8465;570;His acting was fantastic how he cried for his friend Wilson and I cried too.
I:8465;571;I've enjoyed this movie for years when it appeared on tv.
I:8465;572;Now I can watch it uninterupted.
I:8465;573;The special features are a welcome addition as well.
I:8465;574;video release, but Hanks gives a compelling performance.
I:8465;575;The island scenes, which form the majority of the film's running time, are undoubtedly the highlight of the project.
I:8465;576;Tom Hanks is a magnificent actor.
I:8465;577;This movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in a career as an actor.
I:8465;578;This is not the best movie ever made but it is certainly one of the best screen performances to date.
I:8465;579;It was the 3rd time for me and I still thoroughly enjoyed viewing it again!!
I:8465;580;Hanks should have won the Best Actor Oscar this year instead of Russell Crowe!
I:8465;581;Cast Away takes all of those securities and hides them away, leaving us with an incredible and harrowing story of survival and determination.
I:8465;582;Circumstances intervene, and he finds himself rearranging his schedule in order to make a trip across the Pacific for business.
I:8465;583;minute plane crash sequence that raises the intensity, the true Zemeckis style kicks into gear, as Chuck is left in a rubber life raft in stormy seas, the only light source coming from sudden flashes of lightning.
I:8465;584;the story becomes more intriguing with the transition of time during his stay on the island: he learns the secrets of creating life's little commodities.
I:8465;585;ex box, his battered life.
I:8465;586;painted face whom he calls Wilson.
I:8465;587;let's be honest: this is probably the best deserted island movie to date, possibly ever made.
I:8465;588;Being alone on the island allows the story to explore the inner human strength and spirit, as well as new methods of companionship.
I:8465;589;other techniques bring the movie to a full.
I:8465;590;force magnitude that keeps us engrossed with what goes on.
I:8465;591;This leaving out of the musical score gives an added focus to his situation as well as reflecting on his solitude and loneliness.
I:8465;592;The nature surrounding Chuck is beautifully captured and photographed, and under Zemeckis's helm, the setting is ominous and brooding without becoming too overpowering.
I:8465;593;hanks gives, without a doubt, the best performance to date of his career, topping his work in Forrest Gump.
I:8465;594;His acting, along with the aforementioned techniques, puts us right there with him as he begins to learns the small things in life can be quite complicated.
I:8465;595;At the movie's end, I felt compelled to inquire why Russell Crowe received the Best Actor Oscar for his work in Gladiator, when the performance by Hanks is much more involving.
I:8465;596;nonetheless, Cast Away is a compelling tale spun from the director of Contact, who tells the story the way it needs to be told.
I:8465;597;Hanks brings his best screenwork to the movie, while the entire effect of the movie is one of sheer awe and enamoration.
I:8465;598;the scenery is beautiful too.
I:8465;599;"CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list
I:8465;600;And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection.
I:8465;601;tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.
I:8465;602;"This is easily one of his signature roles
I:8465;603;day Robinson Crusoe is remarkable.
I:8465;604;Helen Hunt, as the bereaved finacee who finally weds another man is heart.
I:8465;605;The film is based on a true experience.
I:8465;606;It is interesting that he does this after Nolands' invented friend Wilson also leaves him alone.
I:8465;607;Quite simply, this is Hollywood at its best.
I:8465;608;Hanks, in his role as Chuck Noland, is superb in this film.
I:8465;609;surviving through ingenuity on his island was fascinating, the story's emotional heart is played out upon his return, when he finds out he's been cast away by his fiancee.
I:8465;610;ray, and was surprised by how well it has held up.
I:8465;611;Robert Zemeckis brings all of his considerable visual talents to 'Cast Away,' as well as the latest in CGI technology (at least circa 2000).
I:8465;612;As such, the film is visually sumptuous all the way through .
I:8465;613;The level of depth and detail reaches fantastic, and the color saturation is exquisite.
I:8465;614;The shimmering waters are a gorgeous, crystal clear blue, and the expansive vistas are flush with deep jungle greens.
I:8465;615;Just as impressive are darker scenes, with shadow delineation holding up wonderfully even in scenes with minimal light sources (such as moonlight or a bonfire).
I:8465;616;Yes, there is grain in the picture, but all of the positive elements can elevate 'Cast Away' to the level of demo material.
I:8465;617;The presentation is also nice and sharp, with no irritating edge enhancement or other compression issues.
I:8465;618;ray catalog title, but it's one of the best I've seen yet from Fox.
I:8465;619;and think that this is the ultimate survival video!
I:8465;620;and Tom Hanks is a clean cut hero!
I:8465;621;It is a nice, a good, nice, film as few can make better than the talented Tom Hanks, Now, I am not saying that Tom Hanks is personally a nice guy, I don't know him.
I:8465;622;I am saying that as John Wayne, with a big assist from John Ford, created John Wayne who played John Wayne roles superbly, so Tom Hanks has created Tom Hanks, the character who can play a variety of nice guys in diverse situations.
I:8465;623;This is a very moving film of one man's determination to stay alive while alone on a desert island after a plane crash.
I:8465;624;when he is finally rescued, he discovers that his fiancee has moved on with her life, and he is in effect, cast away again.
I:8465;625;But it is a film that sticks to your mind like a good meal sticks to your ribs.
I:8465;626;In his line of work, time is everything.
I:8465;627;There is some very nice symbolism in the film when it is finally time for him to let go of the soccer ball.
I:8465;628;this is both a depressing and an uplifting film, both at the same time.
I:8465;629;The pacing is good and there always seems to be something that draws your interest in the story.
I:8465;630;In short, another fine Tom Hanks flick!
I:8465;631;"It's fun
I:8465;632;I love this movie and feel that there's so many views of the ocean and land that you really do need a wider view of everything.
I:8465;633;Replaced by natural wind, sea and nature sounds.
I:8465;634;The effect adds to the languid passage of time felt by maroonee Hanks.
I:8465;635;A very good choice, to can the music.
I:8465;636;And where there is music, it is quiet and appropriate, a most welcome antithesis to John Williamsesque blare and bombast.
I:8465;637;I love movies when man overcomes nature to survive.
I:8465;638;A very feel good movie!
I:8465;639;I enjoyed this movie a lot and can't figure the negative 1.
I:8465;640;star reviews as my Blu.
I:8465;641;The emotional trauma of such an experience were perfectly portrayed.
I:8465;642;After seeing this film my first thought at the end of the movie was, thats it .
I:8465;643;Tom Hanks gives an oscar worthy presentation once again, and its basically just him throughout the whole movie.
I:8465;644;Between all the wooden acting that everyone gives in this movie, it was something of a relief when Tom Hanks got to the island, there we had just him and lots of nice outdoor photography to look at.
I:8465;645;I lovedthis movie, when I saw it in the theater in 2000!
I:8465;646;I thought thestory was great, and the movie was very well made!
I:8465;647;Thismovie really makes you appreciate what you have!
I:8465;648;Before he leaves, Helen gives him a watch.
I:8465;649;This is the mark of good story telling.
I:8465;650;It takes too long, and suddenly the walls seem fairly appealing.
I:8465;651;the directing for the island parts is impressive, even poetic.
I:8465;652;Hanks gives a solid performance, but it could have been a bit more subtle.
I:8465;653;When I'm left in this disposition I am always at my most thoughtful.
I:8465;654;One Christmas Day he's called away suddenly on important business, and whilst flying over the Pacific is involved in a plane crash from which he survives.
I:8465;655;Dialogue after this point is few and far between, Hanks' particular relationship that he forms with a Volley Ball of all things is one of the most defining elements of this movie .
I:8465;656;read Yugijouohs' stunning review here in this Amazon customer review section, and you can believe me, he be harsher than I would have been if i talk , but that's repeating, he has said all there is to say!
I:8465;657;as opposed to me impersonally haha eddu make funny.
I:8465;658;Probably the best use of digital storage in this crazy filmmaking world.
I:8465;659;Happily, this is my first positive review on Amazon, and this kind of filmmaking must be a shining city on the hill like Ronald Reagan speech!
I:8465;660;This is my best advice.
I:8465;661;This is just one of those good movies you can watch over and over.
I:8465;662;I bought this for my husband as a gift, and he and I both love the movie.
I:8465;663;This was a gift for my mother for Mother's day.
I:8465;664;Clearly, the majority here think this was an excellent film.
I:8465;665;Just goes to show, well.
I:8465;666;Sort of like watching a real.
I:8465;667;Tom Hanks does a terrific job as the leading (and almost only) role.
I:8465;668;I loved this film, especially the Wilson character, played by Barack Obama.
I:8465;669;it is a good flick.
I:8465;670;also, he goes back and gets with the girl in the truck.
I:8465;671;for those of you that thought this movie was boring.you should have watched it by yourself and not all of your guy friends so you could make fun of the movie together!
I:8465;672;it is a moving movie, the part where he kisses helen hunt is moving.
I:8465;673;good flick, but not best picture.
I:8465;674;This is one of the best films of loss, personal journey and redemption I've ever seen!Tom Hanks clearly deserved the Oscar for best actor of 2000 that year.
I:8465;675;You feel every joy and every sense of excitement when he finally cracks that coconut open and when he finally creates a roaring fire.
I:8465;676;This is a good movie to be sure.
I:8465;677;To fully enjoy it you have to suspend any disbelief you might have of what would have really happened to Tom Hanks on that island.
I:8465;678;It's just about the enjoyment of this movie.
I:8465;679;Hanks does a superb job and the physical transformation he goes through is simply stunning.
I:8465;680;This movie is one to see on the big screen with an audience.
I:8465;681;You really catch the full effect of the hardships that way.
I:8465;682;Cast Away is a good movie, but not so compelling.
I:8465;683;the script is pretty much predicable.
I:8465;684;When you see all the work they did for the Film you'll be amazed.
I:8465;685;It's one of Tom Hanks best and I'm glad to have it.
I:8465;686;It shipped fast and was in good condition.
I:8465;687;Tom Hanks manages to act this entire adventure movie solely on his own and still capture the audience's attention throughout the movie.
I:8465;688;Tom Hanks is a master at acting in almost any roll.
I:8465;689;The man truly amazes me and I loved Cast Away.
I:8465;690;I will watch it many more times.
I:8465;691;A fresh, unconventional story .
I:8465;692;The sweep of where our life lies amongst the world's totality is both the human condition and the most gut.
I:8465;693;wrenching personal experience of our own.
I:8465;694;something one can meditate upon for days after viewing this film (as I did all this evening and morning) .
I:8465;695;This was a good movie with a good storyline.
I:8465;696;Of course Tom Hanks did a very good acting job as always.
I:8465;697;I found this movie interesting, entertaining and actually educational.
I:8465;698;If you ever wondered what it would be like to truly get away from society for awhile, then watch this film!
I:8465;699;production and scouting for the perfect island backdrop.
I:8465;700;Lots of input from the actor, director, writer and others really gives the viewer a feel for what goes on behind and before the camera starts shooting.
I:8465;701;gives the viewer a fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone.
I:8465;702;There is a beautiful shot of him at the top of the hill overlooking everywhere and only seeing the ocean, it makes you feel so insignificant and powerless.You want to believe you are the owner of your destiny but you aren't.
I:8465;703;Without saying much it speaks a thousand words to me.
I:8465;704;Tom Hanks plays the part of a standed man on a remote island brilliantly.
I:8465;705;Tom Hanks is a first class actor anyway and this certainly merits 5 stars.
I:8465;706;FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.
I:8465;707;This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.
I:8465;708;the initial premise was intriguing.
I:8465;709;At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment.
I:8465;710;Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.
I:8465;711;tom Hanks was in top form.
I:8465;712;He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).
I:8465;713;She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.
I:8465;714;This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.
I:8465;715;I have been wanting this film since it came out and it is finally affordable.
I:8465;716;So I have given myself a gift, for absolutely no reason.
I:8465;717;Tom Hank's role in Cast Away is one of his finest performances perhaps due to the difficulty with which the role presents.
I:8465;718;But, alas, Tom Hanks is able to pull this off and the movie is one of the more enjoyable films from director Robert Zemeckis.
I:8465;719;He relies on everything he can to get back to the life he once led.
I:8465;720;the special effects and cinematic strategies used in the film are spectacular and vivid.
I:8465;721;For instance, the airplane crash scene seems to be so powerfully realistic.
I:8465;722;There are instances of no dialogue, where we see Chuck learning about the island and how to do things like attempting to hunt and find food, but Tom Hanks is able to make these moments entertaining and important.
I:8465;723;"For instance, the frustration of trying to open a coconut shell at the beginning is comical, as well as the attempts to start a fire, ending with his own rendition of ""Light My Fire."
I:8465;724;overall, this is an excellent film and works well.
I:8465;725;As usual it came on schedule, properly packaged and throughly enjoyed.
I:8465;726;Tom Hanks is simply amazing, and showed tremendous resilience as a survivor on a tiny barren island that threatened every day to destroy him both emotionally and physically.
I:8465;727;Even if you don't like the end, even if you think the movie was too long, this is a real feat by an incredible actor.
I:8465;728;If you haven't seen this one and you want to watch someone REALLY ACT, see this soon!
I:8465;729;Great movie about survival and the will to live!
I:8465;730;Tom Hanks does his best as usual.
I:8465;731;Castaway presents an interesting series of premises.
I:8465;732;Tom Hanks does a fine job with the role, and despite the beauty of the island, it never is allowed to feel welcoming to us.
I:8465;733;Helen Hunt does a nice job as his old girlfriend, who was forced to grieve for him and move on, and Nick Searcy is excellent as his friend and colleague.
I:8465;734;This movie is very touching, and it's been hard for me to watch it again.
I:8465;735;She came back to Fitzgerald and We hugged each other for a long while.
I:8465;736;i know you could care less about my experience compared to this movie, but anyway Tom Hanks again brings in a great performance in CastAway , just like he did in Saving Private Ryan .
I:8465;737;Which he is found and returns to Texas, and to his job as a Fed.
I:8465;738;But the movie does end on a positive note.
I:8465;739;He experiences loss of human contact, friendship, loved ones, and his own failures.
I:8465;740;As the years pass, he now plays a survivor, who has mastered each day, and creates his own world of friendship.
I:8465;741;Each moral of this wonderful story applies to our lives.
I:8465;742;Hanks outdoes himself as an actor, idealist, and a human being.
I:8465;743;mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade.
I:8465;744;"If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give ""Cast Away"" a viewing."
I:8465;745;This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted.
I:8465;746;this was just a stunningly good movie.
I:8465;747;The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect.
I:8465;748;What I liked most is that as if the story is a replay of man's days during the dawn of civilization.
I:8465;749;All he had on his side was to strong will to overcome all problems in hand with undying spirit.
I:8465;750;the entire episode on the island is very fresh, rare and exciting.
I:8465;751;Usage of dialogue is very economical but thanks to Hanks, its always lively.
I:8465;752;Fred Smith's (FedEx's real life CEO even today) inclusion adds surprise and genuineness but the story could have well ended there.
I:8465;753;If you're a fan of Tom Hanks, than this movie is a must.
I:8465;754;for FOUR YEARS!Much of the movie early on provides foreshadowing for events to arise later.
I:8465;755;There is the love story intertwined within Hanks struggle to survive (albeit they are a married couple).
I:8465;756;After seeing this movie, it'll definetly make you appreciate things a bit more and maybe help you not take so much of your life for granted.
I:8465;757;the plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained.
I:8465;758;To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie.
I:8465;759;still, a great an unique experience which somehow I find myself repeating on a regular basis.
I:8465;760;I love love love this movie!
I:8465;761;Tom Hanks performance was superb.
I:8465;762;saw the movie this summer and thought it was good.
I:8465;763;anything with Tom Hanks is good.
I:8465;764;so I hope the recipients are going to be happy.
I:8465;765;I really enjoyed the movie.
I:8465;766;I kept saying I must see this again to see what I missed.
I:8465;767;Tom Hanks is fabulous, and I thought Helen Hunt did a good job.
I:8465;768;Details on the production and interviews with survival experts.
I:8465;769;If you liked Cast Away.
I:8465;770;This Tom Hanks Classic is in my all time top 10 movies.
I:8465;771;Hanks, stars as an upwardly moving Fed.
I:8465;772;i highly recommend this movie to people that enjoy thinking about a movie for hours after it has ended.
I:8465;773;tom Hanks gives one of his greatest performances of his career and has you believing that you are stuck on that island with himWatch this movie and you will be thinking for hours about how life really turned out for this character.
I:8465;774;A bit long, but the ending is the payoff and much worth the wait.
I:8465;775;There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.
I:8465;776;Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.
I:8465;777;As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot .
I:8465;778;Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though.
I:8465;779;Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening.
I:8465;780;but even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie.
I:8465;781;The clock, as it were, has stopped.
I:8465;782;His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).
I:8465;783;there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.
I:8465;784;act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.
I:8465;785;His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.
I:8465;786;"As his colleague says: ""Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life."""
I:8465;787;Back at home, he's still a castaway.
I:8465;788;"I kept breathing"", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring."
I:8465;789;line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.
I:8465;790;good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live.
I:8465;791;The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.
I:8465;792;he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.
I:8465;793;There is no need for talking, because the actions and emotions are played out so well without it!
I:8465;794;This film is a must.
I:8465;795;hanks puts on a real Oscar performance, the best of his career.
I:8465;796;the movie grabs you and you emotionally ride the waves with Tom in this great new classic that will be on top ten lists years from now.
I:8465;797;a man gets stranded on an island with love giving him hope to go on.
I:8465;798;this is a good film and one of my favorites with Tom.
I:8465;799;Try as it might to be otherwise, this is still a man.
I:8465;800;The surf is much more inviting than the island which remains an unexplored vista.
I:8465;801;The screenplay is an excellent one that packs plenty of jokes to keep you laughing throughout a good portion of the movie.
I:8465;802;Beyond jokes, this movie keeps you constantly on the edge of you seats trying to guess whats gonna happen next from the airplane crashing, how he'll survive on the island, and especially what will be of him Kelly when he comes back.
I:8465;803;Tom Hank's preformance was incredible by keeping it real and emotional with that characteristic Tom Hanks touch.
I:8465;804;of what will happen to Chuck's life now that he's back alive from the island especially with his love life.
I:8465;805;So he begins his new life with uncertainty, waiting and seeing.
I:8465;806;Cast Away is the second movie Robert Zemeckis made in 2000, and it's by far his best one.
I:8465;807;The director is bringing out a lot of worthy films at the moment, and choosing to work with Tom Hanks an awful lot is the right answer to success.
I:8465;808;So, what makes Cast Away worth seeing?
I:8465;809;Well, the movie has a deeper meaning to it .
I:8465;810;"Tom Hanks' performance is absolutely brilliant
I:8465;811;Helen Hunt isn't in this movie much, but when Hanks and her pucker up, it's one of the most magical moments in the movie.
I:8465;812;Cast Away is adventurous, daring, sickening and beautiful, I highly recommend it.
I:8465;813;tom Hanks gave a fine performance, though his character seldom appeared realistic to me (that's just me).
I:8465;814;still, Cast Away looks good and realistic (except for the computer.
I:8465;815;I thought the crash of the plane worthy of special mention.
I:8465;816;well, not wasted time, and I'm sure a lot of people have and will like it.
I:8465;817;but when I saw this movie in the Cinema I really must admit it is an excellent movie.90% of the time, Tom Hanks is alone in the movie.
I:8465;818;and for an actor to do such a job is something.
I:8465;819;He managed to make us laugh loud, sympathize and enjoy the movie.
I:8465;820;this movie is worth watching!
I:8465;821;I'm a fan of the whole cast away from society, forced to survive without technology theme of this movie.
I:8465;822;The acting by Tom Hanks is top.
I:8465;823;It's interesting to watch his character develop throughout the movie, and the fact that he has few dialog lines through the main part is also interesting, and makes him focus the acting much more since he can't define the character through his words.
I:8465;824;Not only is this movie interesting and well.
I:8465;825;done in and of itself, the story behind the scenes is just as interesting.
I:8465;826;"I bought it used
I:8465;827;The second disk, with the behind.
I:8465;828;I was truly impressed with that!
I:8465;829;All of this gives the movie a realism that can't be beat.
I:8465;830;He knows how to act!
I:8465;831;In this he is amazing as a plane wrecked man on an island.
I:8465;832;He makes a friend since he has noone to talk to on the island.
I:8465;833;Also his love for his girlfriend gives him motivation to try to escape the island.
I:8465;834;The movie is overall a great one.
I:8465;835;A very good movie overall.
I:8465;836;This is a painstakingly contemplative film.
I:8465;837;It really makes you think about life and what life has in store for you.
I:8465;838;It's in these closing scenes that Hanks really shows his talent for conveying emotions better felt than spoken.
I:8465;839;The major achievement of this very interesting dramatic premise about the riddled question what if I be in your place?
I:8465;840;I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally get the urge to watch it again about once a year or so.
I:8465;841;I speak strictly of the movie itself.
I:8465;842;it was well done and very haunting with the psychology of loneliness and isolation.
I:8465;843;We're so trained to hear music scores and laugh tracks and they are effecting the feel of the story without us ever knowing it.
I:8465;844;something most of us rarely hear these days.
I:8465;845;You almost have to watch just for popularity purposes, but the reason it's popular is its so damn good.
I:8465;846;Hanks' character is so palpable and real, you feel his frustration, fear and sadness.
I:8465;847;To imagine being so close, yet so far and knowing for so long that everyone you ever loved is moving on without you.
I:8465;848;And how such a intelligent, grounded person is driven to making an imaginary friend out of a volleyball to keep his sanity.
I:8465;849;bottom line, its well done, well acted and a great story about resilience and loneliness and moving on.
I:8465;850;Tom Hanks is EXCEPTIONAL in this movie!
I:8465;851;:) It is an American classic.
I:8465;852;Tom Hanks is very good in this movie.
I:8465;853;There are numerous films that portray the theme of love through various subjects.
I:8465;854;This film portrays the message of what true love is by adopting airplane crash as its subject.
I:8465;855;I believe that such a desparate faith for a single lover would have a profound impact on young couples these days, where 'love for a single person'seems to be falling apart.
I:8465;856;'Cast Away' is a film that chose a quite modern subject to portray the message of love nowadays.
I:8465;857;It's a great movie I want to recommend not only because of its visual entertainment, but also the message it holds behind.
I:8465;858;This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.
I:8465;859;Tom Hanks is a fantastic Actor who pushes his acting talent to the very limit and beyond.
I:8465;860;All the wile you are waiting for the fantastic Island sequences.
I:8465;861;Well trust me its worth it.
I:8465;862;The plane crash sequence is the most realistic and frightining crash I have ever seen.
I:8465;863;The rest of the film is excellent.
I:8465;864;I could go on blabbering about the island, toms acting but a few things stand out above the rest.
I:8465;865;Wilson the vollyball is one of the finest actors hollywood has ever seen.
I:8465;866;He has solid acting, a great expression and a great guy all around.
I:8465;867;He should have won best supporting actor at the academy awards.
I:8465;868;Tom getting scrapped against the coral, Tom getting a really big splinter in his hand in graphic detail, and (Shudder) the skating shoe in the mouth moment is one of the most painfull scenes I have ever had to watch.
I:8465;869;But both of those dont flaw this other wise masterpiece movie.
I:8465;870;the Good: Tom Hanks acting is superb.
I:8465;871;Wilson the Vollyball is a great supporting actor.
I:8465;872;Lots of funny moments, very exciting and well done movie.
I:8465;873;As someone actively involved in a lot of theatre work, I see a lot of good drama.
I:8465;874;The acting is absolutely incredible, the setting spell bounding, and the script amazing.
I:8465;875;The director and writer of this movie thought out almost every detail possible.
I:8465;876;The staging that goes on on the island provides the perfect blend of humor, pain, drama, sadness, and reality.
I:8465;877;The fact that any actor can carry on a monologue for more than an hour is a testament to his skill, but his interaction with himself (via Wilson , the ill.
I:8465;878;to me, the best part of this movie is the ending.
I:8465;879;Although many would disagree with me, breaking the convention was a perfect thing to do.
I:8465;880;this movie is filled with psychological themes, powerful acting, and a passionate plot.
I:8465;881;The ending touches base with real life, and doesn't beat around the bush.
I:8465;882;Cast Away leaves no doubts that this is so, and as such has a much greater impact on the viewer than almost any other movie.
I:8465;883;but it will, on the other hand, leave you thinking.
I:8465;884;i thought the sound affects were great.
I:8465;885;The still loneliness is punctuated by crisp audio.
I:8465;886;it was definitely one of Tom Hanks best roles.
I:8465;887;fi cult classic from the early 60's, Robinson Crusoe On Mars, about a U. s. astronaut stranded all alone on the red planet?
I:8465;888;Instead of futuristic gadgets to work with, our hero has Fed.
I:8465;889;Instead of an adorable wooly monkey an alien slave for company, our stranded protagonist has a volleyball that he draws a face on, names it Wilson (get it?)
I:8465;890;Personally, I'll give Cast Away credit where credit is due: despite being a disjointed film, it is Tom Hanks' terrific performance as Chuck that makes Cast Away the absorbing film that it is.
I:8465;891;for the big middle section of Cast Away, the movie is basically The Tom Hanks Show: he's all that we see for the large second act of the film (which spans four years).
I:8465;892;There's lots of quiet time in this part of the film, too.
I:8465;893;But with Hanks at it's center, you remain absorbed in his adventure (and needless to say, Hanks has got another well.
I:8465;894;deserved Oscar nomination headed his way with this one).
I:8465;895;And kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for his skillful direction of his star, as well as his incredible photography.
I:8465;896;Therefore, despite being imperfect, Cast Away still gets a solid recommendation from me.
I:8465;897;It's Tom's show all the way, and it's a good one.
I:8465;898;very good family movie,tom hanks does an awesome job playing roleloved it when tom hanks was trying to start the fire on the island and i liked when he was talking to wilson the ball
I:8465;899;I'm a big, big fan of this movie, so I was excited to get the blu.
I:8465;900;ray version, thinking it would be beautiful given the subject and location of the film.
I:8465;901;Always good to go back and watch it again.
I:8465;902;it is a bit long but it is a really good movie.
I:8465;903;I really appreciate being treated like an intelligent being by movie makers.
I:8465;904;Movie highlights for me were: the plane crash scene is among the most exciting ever filmed, Tom Hanks'dramatic weight loss after he's been on the island for a few years adds realism, and the pace of the movie (even though it is long I didn't want it to end).
I:8465;905;perect example of good idea, probably even a good treatment and I might go as far as suspecting there used to once be a good script for Cast Away.
I:8465;906;I instead of making what could have been a very meaningful film, he decided to foof it up, add some tears and some smiles, make that all tears and smiles, to a point that the story doesn't really matter.
I:8465;907;But big corporation good for us little guys who need our packages on time (since time rules our lives too, we need things FAST).
I:8465;908;And the funniest thing about the third act is that he finds himself emerced in work as soon as he gets back to the world again.
I:8465;909;And he seems happy doing so.
I:8465;910;And he finds his new love how else, but by successfully delivering a federal express package to her (one of the packages that washes up on the deserted with Hanks .
I:8465;911;Anytime Robert Zemckis makes a movie I take notice.
I:8465;912;the setting of the island was beautiful yet with an ironic twist.
I:8465;913;i really liked the movie and the extas are worth the cost of the movie by itself.
I:8465;914;Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and this is one of his masterpieces.
I:8465;915;anyone who can make you fall for a Volley ball has to be a genius!
I:8465;916;Tom Hanks is really good in this heartwarming and sometimes emotional adventure movie with some comedy.
I:8465;917;I like one part when his best friend all covered by Hanks injured red blood on this volleyball which he calls and names it Wilson .
I:8465;918;How a movie can rivet you without having little or no dialogue is cinematic genious.
I:8465;919;This was one of Tom Hanks' best roles.
I:8465;920;It's pathetic, but each accomplishment in stone age living is poignant in its way.
I:8465;921;*** For such a major studio production, it's amazing not to have the extravagant trappings of costuming, makeup, special effects, and stunts.
I:8465;922;sided exchanges he has with his sole companion .
I:8465;923;Even the musical score is held back for much of the movie, and when it does re.
I:8465;924;Hanks is articulate, accessible, and extremely thoughtful as he talks about Cast Away, Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers (his HBO miniseries based on the Stephen Ambrose book).
I:8465;925;That sad thing is that the only part of this movie I remember clearly and that had more to it than the scenes I saw in the TV spots was that incredible plane crash sequence.
I:8465;926;Zemeckis is brilliant with this kind of high.
I:8465;927;There were some things that I latch onto with some thought.
I:8465;928;When I say that I know there was a tremendous amount of work that went into it and a lot of money and time and talent.
I:8465;929;I'll try better with my next review.
I:8465;930;Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed.
I:8465;931;It becomes quite interesting to see the de.
I:8465;932;evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills.
I:8465;933;Castaway is chock full of memorable moments and will stick to your ribs, it is a movie you will not soon forget.
I:8465;934;Dam this film is still on.
I:8465;935;To see Hanks like this on the island, doing things is amazing enough.
I:8465;936;The way he shows his eyes, the way the camera shows the fire being made, the face, even the look on the face of his inanimate volleyball Wilson, is extraordinary.
I:8465;937;Speaking of which, even though the volleyball which is named Wilson (intentionally, but possibly not) never speaks, it and Hanks give one of the best on.
I:8465;938;The fact that he can communicate with this lifeless yet quirkily funny sport's object and make it entertaining in some ways similar to Jay and Silent Bob, is just one of the film's triumphs.
I:8465;939;overall, not only does Tom Hanks give the best performance of the year, he gives his second best performance of his career.
I:8465;940;Bravo to him and every scene on the island for making such a compelling presence, even if the film isn't completely it.
I:8465;941;Really liked this movie about 5 days after I saw it originally.
I:8465;942;It gives you a lot to think about .
I:8465;943;With Zemekis, one of our most imaginative American directors at the helm, and Tom Hanks, one of our greatest actors and surely the ONLY reason Hollywood has ANY excuse WHATSOEVER to hold up its head in the reality genre of acting.
I:8465;944;well, what we have here is the tale of a man of determination and strong will, his love for life, as symbolized by a photo of the woman he left behind in Memphis, and his relationship with his best friend Wilson (classic Zemekis Touch, Wilson is).
I:8465;945;I think this is the mild, sweet point this movie is making, and I liked it.
I:8465;946;I liked the light touch, the sudden humor at times, even the devotion between a man and his ball.
I:8465;947;i found touching Tom Hank's perfect depiction of a person who made a choice to live and struggled every day, and grew the better for it as a person.
I:8465;948;Great acting, Tom Hanks carried the whole movie!
I:8465;949;And this physical transformation was impressive to say the least.
I:8465;950;"I have been a huge Tom Hanks fan for many years and I have seen many of his movies, but I rate ""Cast Away"" as one of the best films he has ever made."
I:8465;951;Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive.
I:8465;952;He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.
I:8465;953;Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.
I:8465;954;With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.
I:8465;955;Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be together after so much had happened to both of them.
I:8465;956;the ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.
I:8465;957;this is a great movie.
I:8465;958;Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.
I:8465;959;The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.
I:8465;960;Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.
I:8465;961;It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.
I:8465;962;I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.
I:8465;963;i give this movie my absolute highest recommendation.
I:8465;964;Tom Hanks is excellent and the story is terrific.
I:8465;965;Watch and see how one man's courage and will to live conquer all obstacles.
I:8465;966;This was a gift and I am so glad it shipped when it was supposed to and it works like it should.
I:8465;967;Although I don't like the ending (which I won't give away here), this is a flick for all to see!
I:8465;968;The film never really explores any of the psychological issues that a man that does such things must surely have.
I:8465;969;It would be nice if the film actually created a believeable set of developed characters for Hanks to interact with when he was off the island.
I:8465;970;what *did* work for me was the decent direction, and the basic narrative.
I:8465;971;A traumatic event like this has wide.
I:8465;972;It's entertaining and nothing more.
I:8465;973;A funny heartwarming classic of how a man ends up on an island and how he copes with the struggles he faces.
I:8465;974;out and full of interesting information.
I:8465;975;If you want a movie that will have replay value, give this one a try.
I:8465;976;I've watched this movie about 4 times already, and I expect to be able to watch it once a year or so for some time to come.
I:8465;977;And the version that has extra features is really nice: where the survival experts talk about what it would really be like to stay alive in a situation like what is in this movie.
I:8465;978;Still good, just slow in parts.
I:8465;979;Still wondering what happened those 4 years!
I:8465;980;I really love this movie.
I:8465;981;Tom Hanks is definitely at his best in the best film of the year!
I:8465;982;The story of Chuck Noland wows audiences everywhere.
I:8465;983;This is an amazing film with superior acting and directing and equally incredible special effects.
I:8465;984;This is a must see for everyone in search of a great film.
I:8465;985;A story of struggle and hope.
I:8465;986;How refreshing to find a film that makes me want to go back to the theatre and see it again!
I:8465;987;One of his better roles, up there with 'Forrest Gump'.
I:8465;988;The plane crash is very well done and artfully planned to realistically get him to that desert island.
I:8465;989;the movie dragged a bit during the three years that Chuck was on the island, and was much more exciting when he returns home and finds how life moved on during his absence.
I:8465;990;Very touching movie, and interesting and unsuspected ending.
I:8465;991;It was a good movie but the ending was bad but still over all a good movie!
I:8465;992;admittedly this is a simple story.
I:8465;993;It's the difference between a good film and a great film.
I:8465;994;Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland.
I:8465;995;Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not.
I:8465;996;It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film.
I:8465;997;It's more in the style of older foreign language films.
I:8465;998;I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round.
I:8465;999;Cast Away is a ok movie.
I:8465;1000;Will spark discussions around the purpose to life and whether there is a God who created, upholds creation, guides our lives, and is concerned with mankind.
I:8465;1001;I felt great to be able to talk to normal people, I know if I went through this ordeal I would never be the same.
I:8465;1002;great movie Tom Hanks is outstanding as usual.
I:8465;1003;And it's a real tribute to both Zemeckis and Hanks that this particular film was so effective.
I:8465;1004;In my mind the ending was very straightforward.
I:8465;1005;I personally thought that it was a great ending.
I:8465;1006;zemeckis is to be commended since visually and graphically the film was stunning.
I:8465;1007;That includes the crash, dental work, casting off, and for me the most emotional moment of the entire film is when the ship appears.
I:8465;1008;Great show for someone that wants to see a person overcome adversity.
I:8465;1009;The scenery is beautiful and I personally like the idea of the character meeting the farm girl at the end.
I:8465;1010;I do agree with the Oscar for Best Actor Going to Russell Crowe, but that doesn't take away from the brilliant performance of Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1011;Let me start by saying that I liked this movie .
I:8465;1012;It is Cast Away .
I:8465;1013;How he deals with it, and how he tries to deal with being thrust back into society, are the focal points of the film.
I:8465;1014;It was a film that I thought about over and over in the weeks after seeing it.
I:8465;1015;I believe it is realistic.
I:8465;1016;Perhaps people want a traditional Hollywood happy ending.
I:8465;1017;Tom Hanks is so good as a lost soul.
I:8465;1018;Best line in the movie is, I'm sorry Wilson!
I:8465;1019;Cast Away (2000) is, very simply, a classic drama that stars Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.
I:8465;1020;Great acting by Hanks, great cinematography, great scenery, great nighttime atmosphere, and a great story of survival and loneliness.
I:8465;1021;There is just a tiny amount of music in this movie.
I:8465;1022;Tom Hanks should have won an Academy Award for Best Actor.
I:8465;1023;When I put the movie in to watch, I was quite surprised that I disagreed often with that review.
I:8465;1024;cast Away is a great film, and it's hard not to like Hanks' performance.
I:8465;1025;His entertaining interaction with his environment despite its desolation of other humans is reason enough to watch the film, and he truly pulls us in to feeling the same as he does: lonely and nearly hopeless.
I:8465;1026;ray edition for picture and audio reasons, I will give my honest feelings.
I:8465;1027;This surprised me because of the film's location.
I:8465;1028;As for inconsistencies, the Cast Away can look stunning at times, only to immediately follow up with blur or grain.
I:8465;1029;If you are interested in stunning photography, don't expect to see it often.
I:8465;1030;This film was nominated for an Oscar for sound, and the Blu.
I:8465;1031;ray displays the audiophile prestige in its full glory.
I:8465;1032;The film is great, and for whatever reason, this is the first copy of the film I've owned.
I:8465;1033;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8465;1034;The performance by Tom Hanks is very very good as well.
I:8465;1035;Throughout his time on the island you can gradually see his sanity beginning to crack, but always he manages to hold on with his picture of the woman he loves.
I:8465;1036;The scene where Tom Hanks character loses Wilson is very good.
I:8465;1037;The scene with him lying on the floor in his hotel room turning the light on and off looking at the picture is absolutely beautiful.
I:8465;1038;It really shows the effect that the island had on him.
I:8465;1039;He's home, but yet he's still the person he was on the island.
I:8465;1040;The highlight of the film however is the meeting with him and the woman he loves.
I:8465;1041;The tension, confusion, anticipation, etc, is all there, and it really pulls the viewer on emotionally as well.
I:8465;1042;There is still hope even though his life was stripped away.
I:8465;1043;all in all, this movie is beautiful, and very very good.
I:8465;1044;It takes the viewer through so many emotions, that it's hard not to lose yourself in the film.
I:8465;1045;Oh, and the scene where the plane goes down is totally intense, I almost forgot about that.
I:8465;1046;Intelligent, well educated [not necessarily formally], honorable individuals are so much more interesting than nerds.
I:8465;1047;and therefore more gratifying and rewarding to identify with.
I:8465;1048;the island undoubtedly had insect life, therefore bird life.
I:8465;1049;2]The minutia of survival could have been educating and fascinating.
I:8465;1050;silvestri's score is magnificent and well placed.
I:8465;1051;as good as it gets.
I:8465;1052;also the cinematography at sea.
I:8465;1053;The final fade out and ambiguity is brilliant, ranking the ending as one of my dozen or so favorites {Vertigo,,Wild Bunch,Lady Jane,The Conversation,Breaker Morant,Silent Running, In The Bedroom,Mr. roberts instantly come to mind].
I:8465;1054;This was a great idea with a great actor that just kind of never gelled.
I:8465;1055;Tom Hanks is amazing in everything he does.
I:8465;1056;this movie is excellent and heartfelt.
I:8465;1057;Pretty good price for a great movie.
I:8465;1058;Cast Away was a fine ilm.
I:8465;1059;The acting by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt was wonderful, and the plot was great.
I:8465;1060;One night he has to go on an airplane to deliver packages.
I:8465;1061;With no one but himself, and Wilson, a volleyball with a hand imprint on it, Tom's character learns that in life you never take things for granted, and live each day with hope, because each new day brings new possibilities.
I:8465;1062;Cast Away was certainly a fine film for everyone to enjoy.
I:8465;1063;The concept of life changing on a dime and moving on.
I:8465;1064;It is another way that he is able to stay alive.
I:8465;1065;His friend Wilson is supposedley another strength that keeps him alive.
I:8465;1066;What I do want to say, is that the people who did not like the movie are the same type that thought Gone in 60 seconds was a masterpiece.
I:8465;1067;Great movie, Tom Hanks is spectacular in it.
I:8465;1068;Good for the whole family to see together for fun.
I:8465;1069;The reviews weren't very attractive for this film, but I love it.
I:8465;1070;I love Tom Hanks, and the movie was believable.
I:8465;1071;If I could give it two and a half stars I would.
I:8465;1072;I give Cast Away four stars .
I:8465;1073;That said, extremely well done, and I loved the non Hollywood ending.
I:8465;1074;This is a great Tom Hanks movie.
I:8465;1075;Tom Hanks is terrific as a FedEx engineer who is marooned on an island after his plane crashes.
I:8465;1076;Cast Away proves that a great actor, with a good script, can tell a compelling story even if he's the only one in it.
I:8465;1077;"Director Robert Zemeckis could have tightened the film a bit here and there, but ""Cast Away"" is still an engaging adventure story about how the will to live can help us survive."
I:8465;1078;But what really caught my attention till the end was the great portrayal by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1079;He led us to see his day.
I:8465;1080;Chuck's survival was a great adventure.
I:8465;1081;It's very real that the only thing that kept Chuck going was hope to be reunited with his love one.
I:8465;1082;the absence of the typical Hollywood happy.
I:8465;1083;ending kind of stuff really makes this film truly unique commendable.
I:8465;1084;It takes patience, understanding realism to bear watching this film.
I:8465;1085;Now, if you are the type who prefers thin plot, light story, everybody happy kind of stuff, Cast Away is definitely not for you.
I:8465;1086;This film is a classic.
I:8465;1087;I liked it as much today as when I first saw it.
I:8465;1088;It was a very moving story and very well done by Tom Hanks!
I:8465;1089;A romance comes to a tragic end and his return from the grave finds a totally changed world without his beloved fiance, who is now married and with children.
I:8465;1090;The sound track is superb.
I:8465;1091;it had a great story.
I:8465;1092;This movie is a classic!
I:8465;1093;Tom Hanks was Oscar Nominated for Best Actor.
I:8465;1094;The crash scene was very exciting on the big screen.
I:8465;1095;Much better than any I have ever seen.
I:8465;1096;I thought the island part would be boring but it's actually the highlight of the film.
I:8465;1097;It could have been happy!
I:8465;1098;Tom Hanks gives a tour de force performance in Castaway a generally excellent survival story.
I:8465;1099;Combining humour, pathos and drama, Tom Hanks deeply humanistic portrayal of a helplessly marooned Fed.
I:8465;1100;ex employee and Robert Zemeckis' cogent direction keep you involved through most of the film.
I:8465;1101;As a frequent flier I found the crash sequence quite harrowing.
I:8465;1102;my greatest nightmare graphically brought to life.
I:8465;1103;Still aside from this point I found Castaway to be both gripping and poignant and worth the investment of time.
I:8465;1104;A simple premise unravels itself to an extraordinary understanding of the human things surrounding us.
I:8465;1105;I want to be tugged with emotion in all its intensity and fashion.
I:8465;1106;such a beautiful film in its essence, the story of a Chuck Nolan who gets stranded on an island with the hope of seeing his fiance again.
I:8465;1107;The very woman that kept Chuck alive should have in some way been worth it.
I:8465;1108;A simple story very visually told and a performance worth the nomination it got, the movie winds slowly to unravel its sincerity.
I:8465;1109;but every year this man brings incredibly fantastic performances.
I:8465;1110;A great movie with a great message of not taking things for granted, and knowing how time and love change the human heart.
I:8465;1111;I just can't resist a good survivor movie and this is certainly one of the best.
I:8465;1112;One of the reasons the film works so well is that Hanks actually lost 50 or 60 lbs during the filming.
I:8465;1113;But it's his portrayal of a man whose spirit than will not give up that gives this movie its soul and in the end.
I:8465;1114;it definitely satisfies the viewer to the point where you almost don't want it to end.
I:8465;1115;This movie is a tour de force for Tom Hanks and has some very compelling moments.
I:8465;1116;He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.
I:8465;1117;By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.
I:8465;1118;Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.
I:8465;1119;This is a very enjoyable movie, it's a little slow at times but rewarding if you stay with it.
I:8465;1120;This movie seems like a natural for a terrific commentary.
I:8465;1121;it's very technically oriented and the sound and camera operators make the same points over and over again.
I:8465;1122;I had never seen this movie, but everyone told me it was good.
I:8465;1123;I finally was able to get it and I enjoyed it.
I:8465;1124;I appreciate the accurate portrayal of real life where we all are surrounded by corporate enties .
I:8465;1125;It was refreshing to find an entertaining movie without the violence, nudity, offcolor dialog.
I:8465;1126;One final comment I thought the fireplace scene near the end was quite memorable.
I:8465;1127;Thanks to all concerned for making an excellent movie that I plan to enjoy many more times including on a plane flight in the near future on my laptop.
I:8465;1128;Hauntingly realistic portrayal of what it would be like to have to fend for oneself.
I:8465;1129;I will say however, that the customer service was again exceptional is receiving this movie.
I:8465;1130;Cast Away is a great movie.
I:8465;1131;A wonderful story with outstanding acting.
I:8465;1132;Now a whole new experience in Blue ray.
I:8465;1133;Great the first time that I saw it years ago!
I:8465;1134;I enjoyed this for the second time through and watched it with my kids.
I:8465;1135;wow tom hanks is fab!
I:8465;1136;he is our favorite actor.
I:8465;1137;in this film he was spot on.
I:8465;1138;from being a not so nice person we see himself becoming of age and is content with himself.
I:8465;1139;the total time alone with kelly/watch he appreciated and grew to love her more.
I:8465;1140;loved the reference to his his best freind wilson .
I:8465;1141;great movie, great location and we love it.
I:8465;1142;Heck, one of the most important characters in the film is a volleyball.
I:8465;1143;This is also a great demonstration as to how a good creative team can take something like that and make it work so amazingly well.
I:8465;1144;the sense of realism represented in the film in pretty much every respect is amazing.
I:8465;1145;I've never been in a plane crash, but I imagine the depiction we see here has more basis in reality than the flashy effects sequences usually see in film.
I:8465;1146;I also loved that they didn't try to make the island out to be some tropical paradise with postcard shots and filtering.
I:8465;1147;It's obviously a nice location, but they appropriately didn't emphasize that as that would negatively effect the films atmosphere.
I:8465;1148;The trials he faces are a tad basic, but yet the two hours flies by before you know it due to a great script and an amazing performance from Hanks.
I:8465;1149;The score is also minimalistic, likely because filling the scenes with music might effect the sense of isolation you are supposed to have.
I:8465;1150;All in all I loved the art direction they took with the film.
I:8465;1151;the metal case this version of the film arrives in is great.
I:8465;1152;The insert is nothing amazing but they did well with the special features.
I:8465;1153;I was a huge skeptic when I first heard about this one, but through an amazing creative team and a great performance by Hanks I can hardly imagine them pulling it off any better.
I:8465;1154;I loved having instant access to this classic film!
I:8465;1155;I wanted to share it with my 12 year old son who had never seen it.
I:8465;1156;Tom Hanks gives another amazing performance in this heart.
I:8465;1157;His trials are great and he stands at the frayed edges of sanity.
I:8465;1158;This is an inspiring tale of hope, loss, and determination.
I:8465;1159;This is the best way to watch this great movie.
I:8465;1160;I was really looking forward to viewing this film and had high expectations.
I:8465;1161;i usually rate a movie based on the way it affects my emotions.
I:8465;1162;The movie and plot are good (4 stars) with pretty deep meanings that really touched me at the time because of a situation I was going through.
I:8465;1163;This movie is deep, moving, and touching.
I:8465;1164;The majority of this movie is shot on the beach with only 1 actor and you are still enthralled.
I:8465;1165;Enjoy it, I know I did.
I:8465;1166;Something about this movie speaks to my soul.
I:8465;1167;Something about the lack of dialogue in this movie refreshes me.
I:8465;1168;Maybe because life is so hurried and harried, I just like how this movie slows you down, strips away the many layers of life, and exposes a bit of the seed within.
I:8465;1169;Just the quiet struggle of a man who decides to keep going, to keep breathing.
I:8465;1170;The camera lingers on scenes of silence, and somehow, it just works for me.
I:8465;1171;The movie's messages that resonate with me are the acceptance of life's losses, the resolution to keep going despite those losses, the perseverence to continue hoping, and the ingenuity and imagination to explore new possibilities.
I:8465;1172;The movie's score nicely accompanies these themes.
I:8465;1173;This is such a great movie, and I would recommend it for anyone who is an adventurer and/or romanticist.
I:8465;1174;I saw the movie when it originally came out years ago, and enjoyed it just as much this time .
I:8465;1175;I always enjoy Tom Hanks but that is beside the point with this gem.
I:8465;1176;the key is to place yourself as best as possible with Tom's character Chuck Noland.
I:8465;1177;i came away from this movie with a much higher appreciation for life itself.
I:8465;1178;I appreciate the people and things I have in my life.
I:8465;1179;If you take the time to immerse yourself, just once, into this movie I am positive you will come away with at least a tinge of appreciation for some aspect of your life.
I:8465;1180;you might find inspiration from Chuck and gratitude for such a fine movie having been produced.
I:8465;1181;Hanks's character is likeable and, we soon find out, very resourceful.
I:8465;1182;Tom Hanks turns in another great performance.
I:8465;1183;One of Tom Hanks best movies about a stranded FedEx employee.
I:8465;1184;I liked it and really enjoy the plot and character developement of Tom Hanks
I:8465;1185;this movie starts out giving us a portrait of Chuck Nolan(Tom Hanks) the Fed.
I:8465;1186;Chuck appears to be arrogant, smart mouthed, and fast on his feet.
I:8465;1187;The one real good thing in Chuck's life is his girlfriend Kelly(Helen Hunt) who he has been in a long relationship.
I:8465;1188;work driven he decides to go on a buisness trip over the up coming Holiday him and Kelly exchanging Christmas gifts in the car.
I:8465;1189;Kelly now, with that hope smashed he has to learn to survie the heartbreak to go on.
I:8465;1190;tom Hanks gives a good performance as Nolan but, not his absolute best.
I:8465;1191;"Helen Hunt also does a good job as Kelly but, her role in ""Pay It Forward"" in my opinon was her best performance ever."
I:8465;1192;"With little to no dialogue in most of the movie, I couldn't help but feel that desertion for Hanks and even I found myself looking upon the ball ""Wilson"" that he talks to a good friend."
I:8465;1193;"Who wouldn't want to be stuck on a deserted island with Hanks?I also like the message contained in the movie when Hanks said ""Tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide will drag in,"" after he loses Kelly, he goes out to Texas so he can return a package he found on the island."
I:8465;1194;i enjoyed this movie, but it's the kind of movie that will only touch you once.
I:8465;1195;Any successful piece of art?The graphics were magnificent, and the plot could have gone somewhere, but it seemed to die somewhere on the island.
I:8465;1196;Tom Hanks returns home and.
I:8465;1197;almost all three stars are for Mr. Hanks' wonderful performance.
I:8465;1198;This film is unquestionably worth seeing for Tom Hanks' amazing performance as Chuck Noland, a time.
I:8465;1199;entry into the land of the living.
I:8465;1200;The action here is hurried and superficially treated as well, calling for a separate film to make a truly moving effect.
I:8465;1201;I ordered this movie one day and the next day it arrived!!!
I:8465;1202;When we first starting watching this movie I was completely in love with everything, the characters, the actors, the story line, the effects.
I:8465;1203;Tom Hanks reunites with director Zemeckis after Forrest Gump and gives another amazing performance, alongside his co. star, Wilson, a vollyball that gets washed up in the wreckage from the plane crash.
I:8465;1204;And this is where Hanks' brilliant performance shows, with the slowly building friendship that Chuck has with his vollyball buddy.
I:8465;1205;zemeckis' direction is strong and well.
I:8465;1206;The fact that Hanks can hold his own as the only guy on the island for two hours (albeit with Wilson) is a true testimony of his unique talent.
I:8465;1207;But it's at sea where the magic is, and despite it's flaws, it is an impressive adventure.
I:8465;1208;I found the symbolism in this movie to be quite significant and relevant.
I:8465;1209;(In regards to the previous review concerning the package.
I:8465;1210;I loved the movie until he met with his girlfriend.
I:8465;1211;"She told him that he was the ""love of my life"", yet it didn't take her long to find someone else."
I:8465;1212;ray and picked it up.
I:8465;1213;I knew that the island scenes would be amazing with the higher resolution.
I:8465;1214;price for the movie was great.
I:8465;1215;Castaway is one of those original, classic movies with brilliant acting by Tom Hanks and a story that makes you think.
I:8465;1216;chuck Nolan, an international manager for Federal Express, is a nice.
I:8465;1217;If he has one great talent, it is his life.
I:8465;1218;long ability to manage his time and get the job done.
I:8465;1219;He has friends, family, and the acclaim of his colleagues, yet he is somewhat disconnected from it all.
I:8465;1220;For example, he finds it easier to recommend a good cancer specialist to a friend whose wife is dying rather than express his own sympathies.
I:8465;1221;There are a lot of life lessons this movie has to offer.
I:8465;1222;I love many Tom Hanks movies.
I:8465;1223;This one is one of my favorites!
I:8465;1224;I love a movie that challenges me as a viewer and this movie definitely did that.
I:8465;1225;The how it was done feature was great as was the vollyball feature and I just loved the Charlie Rose/Hanks interview.
I:8465;1226;has something to say about the film I was facinated.
I:8465;1227;I loved both discs in the two disc set and I know that from time to time I will pull out this gem and enjoy it all over again.
I:8465;1228;The theme of people and their possessions and relationships being cast away through life is woven throughout this amazing tale.
I:8465;1229;As he cast away his preconceived notions of what things are important in life, he so struggles to hang onto the hope of reconnecting with his girl friend.
I:8465;1230;days of early survival melt into over four years as he finds his only priority in life is to just be able to breath each day, one day at a time.
I:8465;1231;The physical and emotional transformation of Tom Hanks is beyond remarkable, it is stunning.
I:8465;1232;Yet the best is saved for last.
I:8465;1233;Her heart was in some way never letting go of the hope that he might live, yet her head cast away the relationship to allow her to continue on with her life, marry and have children.
I:8465;1234;She almost wants to cast away her husband, children and her comfortable life to return to the love of her life, yet he knows in his heart that he must at last cast away his heart felt hope of someday returning and marrying her.
I:8465;1235;his hope was his life line, yet his hope now must be cast away to free himself to live the rest of his life.
I:8465;1236;He follows his heart in the closing scene to find himself faced with a decision that many of us never allow ourselves to face, that of in which new direction do I live my life.
I:8465;1237;helen Hunt again proves herself as one of our great dramatic actresses.
I:8465;1238;Tom Hanks is always believable in everything he does.
I:8465;1239;and the best survival movie .
I:8465;1240;Great acting, gripping story, and, best of all, a great message.
I:8465;1241;Even though it's not a Christian movie per se, it has, in my opinion, a very Christian message .
I:8465;1242;Tom Hanks did a remarkable job inthis film, too include losing the weight and making the character and circumstance very believable!
I:8465;1243;"Russell Crowe is, without a doubt, very good in ""Gladiator"", but Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" is superb."
I:8465;1244;It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy.
I:8465;1245;Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.
I:8465;1246;It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film.
I:8465;1247;the second part of the movie is the crux of the film.
I:8465;1248;He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance.
I:8465;1249;Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire.
I:8465;1250;the third part with the film has to do with his being rescued.
I:8465;1251;Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances.
I:8465;1252;Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away.
I:8465;1253;Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.
I:8465;1254;i liked this movie alot.
I:8465;1255;but it was still a good movie.
I:8465;1256;Tom Hanks is simply amazing.
I:8465;1257;Director Robert Zemeckis(Forrest Gump) and Hanks have combined again and succeeded again.
I:8465;1258;Very few actors could tackle a project like this and still keep it interesting and engaging, especially for as long as he does in this film.
I:8465;1259;First of all, I have to say right up front that I highly respect Tom Hanks and his acting ability.
I:8465;1260;second of all, I love to be entertained.
I:8465;1261;okay, that's all well and fine.
I:8465;1262;I go to and watch movies for the entertainment value, and Cast Away entertained the heck out of me.
I:8465;1263;But everything in between, from that heart.
I:8465;1264;When it does come, it sweeps you away and tugs at your heart.
I:8465;1265;in short, I thought this movie was great.
I:8465;1266;I loved everything on the island, I thought Wilson was a great side.
I:8465;1267;character (definitely the best acting volleyball I've ever seen), and so many other things that I won't go into here.
I:8465;1268;if you haven't seen it yet, give it a chance.
I:8465;1269;If you watch it, it give some imporession to you.
I:8465;1270;Don't get me wrong, I had a great time watching it.
I:8465;1271;Tom Hanks is fun to watch, the story moves along at a nice pace, and Zemeckis does a good job of getting you to care about Hanks and Hunt.
I:8465;1272;A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed.
I:8465;1273;Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties.
I:8465;1274;cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
I:8465;1275;tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.
I:8465;1276;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!
I:8465;1277;There are always birds, birds, birds everywhere.
I:8465;1278;Another good tom Hanks movie.
I:8465;1279;I enjoyed it all the way through.
I:8465;1280;This was an excellent movie.
I:8465;1281;I had seen it before and will watch it again and again.
I:8465;1282;Just all in all a great movie.
I:8465;1283;you have really created a truly amusing film.
I:8465;1284;The best part of this movie is the friend he creates out of a ball that came from one of many packages that wash up.
I:8465;1285;He gives it a little face and speaks to it, calling it Wilson .
I:8465;1286;They laugh together and cry together.
I:8465;1287;He stands in the road signaling that he is making life.
I:8465;1288;If you are in need of a good laugh, this is the movie for you!
I:8465;1289;Who the heck gives this movie one star?!
I:8465;1290;I can see 4 stars, or even maybe, 3 stars.
I:8465;1291;what an amazing performance by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1292;Definitely shows his chops as an actor.
I:8465;1293;Acting with no one else in the scene has got to be one of the hardest things to do as an actor, and he does it brilliantly.
I:8465;1294;i saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 2000, and I loved it then.
I:8465;1295;This movie really makes you wonder.
I:8465;1296;and the title is perfect .
I:8465;1297;For me it was a great treat watching Billy.
I:8465;1298;it has a pretty big cast .
I:8465;1299;cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich).
I:8465;1300;"Quite a cast, right?Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see)
I:8465;1301;A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines .
I:8465;1302;Overall I loved the movie.
I:8465;1303;This is something to own!
I:8465;1304;This movie takes you through so many emotions.
I:8465;1305;Tom Hanks, as always, is incredible.
I:8465;1306;he is a superior actor and met the challenges of this role.
I:8465;1307;I enjoyed watching the interpretation of the challenges he would face on a deserted island and how he survived.
I:8465;1308;He had to face the challenge of re.
I:8465;1309;I still think that overall it is an excellent film.
I:8465;1310;one which everyone should watch!
I:8465;1311;Not a strong storyline, but I did enjoy it.
I:8465;1312;Tom Hanks was excellent as always in it and I liked the idea of being alone on an uninhabited tropical island (come on.
I:8465;1313;I dislike ugly language, and as there is truly only one incident, so I can mute it for a matter of seconds and go right back to enjoying my movie.
I:8465;1314;No way to have a completely happy ending, but a very satisfying one.
I:8465;1315;Robinson Caruso On Mars was a much stronger and inspiring, even though science fiction movie.
I:8465;1316;The movie was perfect and the blu.
I:8465;1317;ray edition is very good, I believe Tom Hanks has to won the Oscar.
I:8465;1318;Years later, scenes of Tom Hank's character Chuck's frenetic career, the plane crash, and the 4.
I:8465;1319;reunion at the FedEx terminal, the reunion of mixed and conflicting emotions at Kelly's house, now also inhabited by her new husband and young daughter, and Chuck's emotional conversation with his work colleague and friend.
I:8465;1320;These scenes are powerful evocations of the complexity of human thought and emotion: dealing with a reunion that is awkward, confusing, and undefinable.
I:8465;1321;The director and the actors Hanks and Hunt were brilliant in putting it together.
I:8465;1322;Tom Hanks might have had too high of a profile in the 80s to 2000s, but especially in the 90s, but he is such a very good actor.
I:8465;1323;Cast Away is good, that's true.
I:8465;1324;But I still had fun.
I:8465;1325;And the plane crash is awesome.
I:8465;1326;"And this film is an exception to his genre, and it's a very good thing
I:8465;1327;This is surely a good movie, and I'm sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations, because it's exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their Right to Censorship mind.
I:8465;1328;And you can also interpret it as a critic to materialism.
I:8465;1329;Very exciting start when the plane went down, but very laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survuve the crash from 20.25,000 feet.
I:8465;1330;Really enjoyed watching Cast Away with my son.
I:8465;1331;He is 14 and really enjoyed it.
I:8465;1332;It was good to see how you can survive on practicially nothing.
I:8465;1333;This movie has a good thirty minutes which are entertaining and interesting.
I:8465;1334;As it is, it will appeal only to the diehard Tom Hanks follower.
I:8465;1335;The movie itself is great, and Tom Hanks does an amazing job as the only actor for a long period in the movie.
I:8465;1336;Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.
I:8465;1337;This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package.
I:8465;1338;To my surprise, I liked this film much more than I expected and towards the end I was rather impressed.
I:8465;1339;And I felt that I had mostly good time when watching it.
I:8465;1340;The story is rather believable, the ordeal lived by the hero has a kind of realistic touch in it and with time I started to care about Chuck .
I:8465;1341;the last 20 minutes are particularly strong and, well, yes .
I:8465;1342;"beautiful even, to a certain extent in a ""Forrest Gump""."
I:8465;1343;on another hand there is emotion, by moments even a lot of it.
I:8465;1344;but it helps to have at least one.)))
I:8465;1345;Also, it is quite logical that the way out of a tight spot goes through an outhouse.)))
I:8465;1346;"This is essentially a ""one man show"" and Tom Hanks is excellent in this film, which seems like his swan song, because to my considerable regret I do not think I liked him in ANYTHING else since 2000 ."
I:8465;1347;So bottom line, I found this film surprisingly good, I had good time watching it and I sincerely recommend to see it.
I:8465;1348;I loved this movie I even like it better than Forrest Gump its by far Tom Hanks best movie to date.
I:8465;1349;His performance is one of the best I have ever seen.
I:8465;1350;I think tom hanks had fun playing this movie.
I:8465;1351;good acting and good filming.
I:8465;1352;was a fun movie to watch
I:8465;1353;There's a great movie in Cast Away.
I:8465;1354;The time in which a Fed Ex worker named Chuck Noland is stranded on an island, most of the movie, is a triumph in movie.
I:8465;1355;It puts a single actor on what appears to be a single set for a long time with no real dialogue, other characters to interact with or cuts back to the normal world, and manages to stay both captivating and believable the whole time.
I:8465;1356;That has to do with a particular Fed Ex package, one of the few man.
I:8465;1357;This is a tale of survival in the truest sense.
I:8465;1358;Saw it at the theater, and thought it was awesome.
I:8465;1359;Shows you how small we are in this world, and how we need each other to survive.
I:8465;1360;Cast Away puts you in the skin of a decent man who is trying to stay alive.
I:8465;1361;this movie reflects all aspects of beauty!
I:8465;1362;The deeper meaning to it all makes the movie adored by any age and audience.
I:8465;1363;The director did a superb job, as did Tom Hanks!
I:8465;1364;Wanted my boys to see it now,so we streamed it.
I:8465;1365;This movie would make a good screensaver.
I:8465;1366;I like this movie, it's OK.
I:8465;1367;tom Hanks does a great job.
I:8465;1368;There are some great points being made.
I:8465;1369;Pay special attention to the Elvis selections that appear during the movie.
I:8465;1370;Bravo to Mr. Hanks and the crew in making the film.
I:8465;1371;Here was a man who was constantly on the go, always dealing with people, and now he's by himself, without a soul to talk to.
I:8465;1372;I love Cast Away with Tom Hanks!
I:8465;1373;This movie is just amazing!
I:8465;1374;This movie is so fresh and well done that by the end of the movie you'll end up feeling sypathetic for a volleyball!
I:8465;1375;Overall, this is a must for any movie fan looking for an intense, dramatic, and well acted movie about man kind's will for survival.
I:8465;1376;Great seller with fast delivery.
I:8465;1377;The job that one has makes it likely that one will develop a personality that is a function of that job.
I:8465;1378;For him, time is a precious commodity, and can be measured by the units of the clock, not by the ticks of the heart.
I:8465;1379;The body and the soul need time to 'catch up.'
I:8465;1380;this is really two movies in one.
I:8465;1381;there needed to be more character development and better insights into human nature in order to really make this movie into something special.
I:8465;1382;that said, Hank's acting throughout is marvelous, and it is still a compelling film .
I:8465;1383;This is a, good movie about a guy named, Chuck he has to fly before Christmas he does, so his Fed.
I:8465;1384;ex plane crashes he gets stranded on a island for 4 years this is a great movie the features are good.
I:8465;1385;I liked the movie, good performances all around.
I:8465;1386;The plane crashes, and Hanks survives with the many packages in transit.
I:8465;1387;it was a good movie, worth seeing, but I wouldnt own it as I know seeing it once I wouldnt be in the mood to see it again.
I:8465;1388;It's Christmas Eve and Chuck is enjoying a good meal with family and friends when his beeper rings and he finds himself forced to go out on a quick job.
I:8465;1389;He tells his beautiful girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) that he will be home in time for new years celebrations.
I:8465;1390;However a tragic plane crash into the ocean (which is very thrilling and realistic) changes all that.
I:8465;1391;A spokes man for 20th Century Fox Entertainment said that Cast Away is movie about a man lost at sea and how he deals with coming home to world of change.
I:8465;1392;The acting is top flight.
I:8465;1393;The cinematography is excellent and the score is also a plus.
I:8465;1394;For me it was a breathtaking experience.
I:8465;1395;Chuck and Kelly have to exchange gifts in the car and Chuck gives her a box with supposely a wedding ring in it and tells Kelly to hold on to it.
I:8465;1396;It is four years later now and Chuck is an expert at catching fish.
I:8465;1397;A whale squirts water on him when a boat is going by and he gets picked up.
I:8465;1398;One of the best movies ever made in my opinion.
I:8465;1399;Cast Away is a very, very good film.
I:8465;1400;Tom Hanks is once again, brilliant, and so is the direction.
I:8465;1401;It's a film that you can watch over and over, but the best part is the first viewing.
I:8465;1402;It's a good film and the best part of it is the script.
I:8465;1403;The last twenty minutes of the film are simply amazing and a lot of people seamed to miss the point.
I:8465;1404;Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan.
I:8465;1405;He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in.
I:8465;1406;He is obsessed with time.
I:8465;1407;the production values are high in Cast Away.
I:8465;1408;The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first.
I:8465;1409;Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended.
I:8465;1410;The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half.
I:8465;1411;I began to picture Hank's big air.
I:8465;1412;Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his work into his history class for the eventual top grade.
I:8465;1413;Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch.
I:8465;1414;And it's because of beautiful special effects a very real(and VERY Oscar.
I:8465;1415;worthy) performance by the ever.
I:8465;1416;dynamic Tom Hanks, and a(mostly) smart script.
I:8465;1417;His marriage is what it is: Chuck and his wife Kelly(the overrated Helen Hunt in an underrated performance) see each other in short bursts but are very happy with the agreement they have and actually SMILE at each other during their day.
I:8465;1418;sayers comment that this could have been really good and call it BAD, I say that this could have been really BAD and I'm calling it good.
I:8465;1419;not), create fire(in a hilariously bittersweet scene), and spear fish and crab for edible goods.
I:8465;1420;i've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle.
I:8465;1421;I think this movie is successful.
I:8465;1422;After the island, he's transformed into something humbled.
I:8465;1423;but by now, it's so easy to him.
I:8465;1424;but Zemeckis has such a wonderful way of softening the hand that's slapping you in the face(just like he softened it for Gump and the soft.
I:8465;1425;spoken Contact ), that it's easy to take.
I:8465;1426;scenes was the perfect choice.
I:8465;1427;Castaway is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.
I:8465;1428;Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his/her work into their history class for the eventual top grade.
I:8465;1429;Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch.

I:8465;1435;i've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle.
I:8465;1436;I think this movie is successful.
I:8465;1437;After the island, he's transformed into something humbled.
I:8465;1438;but by now, it's so easy to him.

I:8465;1440;"spoken ""Contact""), that it's easy to take."
I:8465;1441;His use of sound and the decision to NOT use Alan Silvestri's understated and gentle music score during the island.
I:8465;1442;scenes was the perfect choice.
I:8465;1443;Castaway is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.
I:8465;1444;Cast Away is one of those rare movie experiences.
I:8465;1445;The real experience of the movie is when you continue to thing about it later that day and many days there after.
I:8465;1446;It is a metaphor for the work.
I:8465;1447;a. holic, ultimately questioning whether it all is worth it in the end.
I:8465;1448;Tom Hanks is absolutely brilliant as the main character(he was robbed of the oscar).
I:8465;1449;Although the movie is long, Hanks is able to hold up the movie.
I:8465;1450;This one is a keeper for lovers of cinema.
I:8465;1451;There are a handful of visionary directors out there that are worth seeing every film (good or bad) that they are involved with.
I:8465;1452;For me, those directors are Spike Lee, David Fincher, Oliver Stone, Spike Jonze, Steven Spielberg, the Coen Brothers, James Cameron, Stephen Soderbergh, and Robert Zemeckis.
I:8465;1453;Whether the film succeeds or not is not what's important to me.
I:8465;1454;robert Zemeckis is one of those few directors that succeeds in this time and time again.
I:8465;1455;"without giving away any of the plot points in ""Cast Away,"" he has managed to do so again."
I:8465;1456;Cast Away is one of the best movies in 2000 and so much better than Gladiator which was so boring.
I:8465;1457;You have to see Cast Away because its a really really excellent movie.
I:8465;1458;Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis teams again and deliver a nice film.
I:8465;1459;the story recreates in some measure the experiences of Robinson Crusoe transposed to our times.
I:8465;1460;Still he sticks to life.
I:8465;1461;the last part of the motion picture faces the watcher with a complex and heartbreaking dilemma.
I:8465;1462;Nevertheless Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances, including a physical transformation, which took him more than a year to accomplish.
I:8465;1463;Finally I decided to open the package and start it up.
I:8465;1464;Let's all do this again, until we get it right.
I:8465;1465;I've always enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to any who haven't seen it yet.
I:8465;1466;What an incredible movie that deserves nothing less than five stars.
I:8465;1467;It's a deeply moving and affecting experience.
I:8465;1468;It's very realistic and true.
I:8465;1469;Hanks is flawless as are his supporting cast.
I:8465;1470;A number of themes come through here including the importance of not taking things for granted.
I:8465;1471;I enjoyed this movie, strangely enough, considerably more the second time I watched it about three years after its release.
I:8465;1472;It is sooo enjoyable and you are riveted from the instant the plane is in trouble.
I:8465;1473;Zemeckis is a genius and he and Hanks are greatest team in Hollywood ie) Forrest Gump??
I:8465;1474;The concept Cast Away is meant to be a metaphor for stripping away or casting away all the trappings of a normal, modern existence, thereby finding out what is truly important in life.
I:8465;1475;with a breathtaking performance, Tom Hanks played Chuck Noland, FedEx systems engineer whose life is ruled by the clock as his demanding job propels him across the world with hardly a second notice.
I:8465;1476;While his fiancee and co. workers assume he's dead, he must give up everything that he once took for granted and learn how to survive both physically and emotionally.
I:8465;1477;cast Away is a model of restrained storytelling that's studded with a series of pure emotional peaks.
I:8465;1478;The movie is trying to impart a lesson of determination and the will to survive.
I:8465;1479;the production design and musical of the movie are outstanding, as well as the direction of Zemeckis.
I:8465;1480;The acting, especially by Hanks, is top rate.
I:8465;1481;Its one of those you love it or hate it.
I:8465;1482;in my mind its a great movie!
I:8465;1483;You will find yourself saying what an idiot I would have a house and fire by this point, but it really gives you a good view of an everyday man trying to survive.
I:8465;1484;I thought this movie was pretty good.
I:8465;1485;I can't imagine Tom Hanks screneing the film and saying looks great, winking whale and all.
I:8465;1486;Everything else ranged from great to highly entertaining.
I:8465;1487;Tom Hanks is awesome and this movie is a classic movie!
I:8465;1488;It's the BEST and one of my favorites!
I:8465;1489;Castaway is a great movie.
I:8465;1490;For most of the movie Tom Hanks is by himself and he is able to do.
I:8465;1491;Hanks is able to deliver a powerful performance about how a person is able to surivive the worst situration.
I:8465;1492;I've seen Cast Away a couple of times look forward towatching again.
I:8465;1493;Beyond the fact that Tom Hanks is terrific in it, the human stories told in it always impressed me.
I:8465;1494;Tom Hanks surely takes it to the next level.
I:8465;1495;a personality businessman, but he comes across well as a modern Everyman surviving on a desert island.
I:8465;1496;There is a good deal of humor and a number of Cool Idea!
I:8465;1497;So much emphasis in today's world is placed on having the right gear, having the best technology and having the best skills available.
I:8465;1498;In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non.
I:8465;1499;from a survival point of view this movie is awesome!
I:8465;1500;A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented.
I:8465;1501;I must say that the plane crash scene is one of the finest i've every seen in a movie!!
I:8465;1502;You can actually see in his face the will to survive, kept going by a pocket sized picture of his girl!!
I:8465;1503;Another good aspect, is the impressive amount of weight that Hanks lost for the second part of the film .
I:8465;1504;Its this mix of drama with the action and aventure of the first part of the film that makes Cast Away a compelling watch!
I:8465;1505;I bought it from Amazon and it was delivered on time.
I:8465;1506;A positive experience shopping on Amazon.
I:8465;1507;, director Zemeckis outdoes himself with CastAway with many inventive and exhilarating scenes of loss, joy, and a little madness.
I:8465;1508;"One of the pure joys was Zemeckis' decision not to use music
I:8465;1509;The extras are great and add a lot to the overall package.
I:8465;1510;This one is a keeper and sure to be a classic years from now.
I:8465;1511;Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.
I:8465;1512;"The performance is a brave one
I:8465;1513;It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.
I:8465;1514;The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.
I:8465;1515;He joins Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie) for the Oscar robberies of recent years.
I:8465;1516;This one Has to be his best one yet.
I:8465;1517;If you are a big fan of drama,and survival movies then I highly recommend it.
I:8465;1518;For starters the movie arrived earlier than expected, so shipping was great.
I:8465;1519;The blue ray video and audio is done very well.
I:8465;1520;aS for the movie it is very delightful, it shows a mans true struggle and fight for survival.
I:8465;1521;One of tom hanks best.
I:8465;1522;In Cast Away, Tom Hanks portrays an employee of a package delivery service.
I:8465;1523;Cast Away takes on a compelling theme: one human being alone, stripped of the comforts of civilization, and forced to survive in a sometimes hostile natural environment.
I:8465;1524;hanks received an Oscar nomination for his performance, and he makes the film worth watching.
I:8465;1525;It is fascinating to watch his character's ingenuity at coping with this situation.
I:8465;1526;the film as a whole is not entirely satisfying.
I:8465;1527;Nevertheless, Cast Away is well worth watching.
I:8465;1528;And to top it off, they steal music from Braveheart (listen for it)!
I:8465;1529;Boy, this movie was a disapointment.
I:8465;1530;I guess I am so accustomed to Tom Hanks and his association with great films, that when one comes along that is just good, it sort of ruins it for me.
I:8465;1531;the movie begins with a promising premise.
I:8465;1532;i recommend that you go see it, but I'll bet you will leave the theatre feeling the same way so many people I have talked to after seeing this movie.
I:8465;1533;NO surprises, NO twists, NO real plot, and BORING.
I:8465;1534;This is one that I can watch a few times, and probably never plumb the depths of what it means.
I:8465;1535;My suggestion is to let yourself get into the movie, and go with the emotions.
I:8465;1536;It's most notable for what isn't said, and the most intense parts of the movie where there's no dialogue.
I:8465;1537;It definitely took guts to make this movie, and I don't think it will ever be fully appreciated.
I:8465;1538;This film will really put his acting skills to the benefit of all.
I:8465;1539;Chuck completes his latest route, and just when it seems like Christmas and New Years will be a time of peace, Chuck is called in to supervise a flight to Asia.
I:8465;1540;once on the island, Hanks gives us an incredible role, playing Chuck almost entirely through pantomime and body movement.
I:8465;1541;Inside them he finds several items he uses to stay alive.
I:8465;1542;The interaction between Hanks and Wilson is great, with Hanks talking AND responding to Wilson.
I:8465;1543;Alan Silvestri's score plays well, considering there is one universal theme throughout the entire film.
I:8465;1544;The theme ties everything together, and the minimal use of dialogue and music helps us beleive in chucks plight (we also hear what he hears, the waves, the wind, and such).
I:8465;1545;The film is truly great, if you haven't seen it yeet, do so.
I:8465;1546;It had been years since I had seen the movie and while I don't plan on watching it again any time soon, it is a classic!
I:8465;1547;This great movie that arrived well before the estimated delivery date met my expectations and brought all those great memories back.
I:8465;1548;This movie succeeds in every way.
I:8465;1549;packed edge of your seat thriller.
I:8465;1550;It's an emotional journey from start to finish.
I:8465;1551;The ending rips my heart out every time I see it.
I:8465;1552;A great movie and one that I always watch at least some of when I see it on TV.
I:8465;1553;His life is now wide open with any number of choices and ways to go.
I:8465;1554;Cast Away is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so.
I:8465;1555;In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy.
I:8465;1556;go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time .
I:8465;1557;we meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).
I:8465;1558;He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.
I:8465;1559;the sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of Cast Away, and taken alone, they're brilliant.
I:8465;1560;"like all Zemeckis' movies, Cast Away is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style
I:8465;1561;overall, Cast Away is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes.
I:8465;1562;Thank you for offerring this movie at such a great price.
I:8465;1563;This is one of my top ten favorite movies.
I:8465;1564;My fascination with this came a while later.
I:8465;1565;A certain premium movie channel was very helpful in that respect.
I:8465;1566;The relationship with Wilson is simply brilliant.
I:8465;1567;In addition, there is something real about this movie.
I:8465;1568;This movie is a great lesson in overcoming functional fixedness!
I:8465;1569;tale reunion, he must deal with the very real fact that she has moved on.
I:8465;1570;A thoroughly realistic storyline and a unique view into the human psyche under immense stress make this a truely original and moving movie.
I:8465;1571;love it or hate it as a movie, this was a spectacular performance by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1572;I can understand the reasoning behind the ending, which is basically to let the audience draw their own conclusion, but we don't need to be beat on the head with a metaphor to get it.
I:8465;1573;In addition, based on Tom Hank's performance, the audience gets attached to his character, and likely wants to see some closure.
I:8465;1574;four years stranded on an island can leave us with much more than sand in our skin.
I:8465;1575;the necessity to relate to other people acquires a worthy value when, drowned in the deepest solitude, we start to talk to a volleyball.
I:8465;1576;"solving, in connecting people
I:8465;1577;"one Christmas eve, Chuck has to go away again, leaving Kelly with the words ""I'll be right back"" floating in the air."
I:8465;1578;life can be full of such ironies.
I:8465;1579;to a world that moved on, where time didn't stop, a world out of sync with Chuck.
I:8465;1580;cast Away is brilliant showing us how irreversible is the past and how marked we are with our experiences.
I:8465;1581;director Robert Zemeckis displays Chuck's life changes with a clean and simple technique.
I:8465;1582;hanks proves his effectiveness carrying the entire movie in his shoulders.
I:8465;1583;And he is equally persuasive and convincing when he goes to that exceptional situation, sympathetic and also worthy of compassion.
I:8465;1584;What can one do?Smile and look the possibilities the road offers you.
I:8465;1585;What follows is the most amazing almost without dialog acting you have ever seen.
I:8465;1586;Cast Away is the embodiment of a frequent fantasy of many people to be stranded on a deserted island.
I:8465;1587;Great concept for a movie, and Tom Hanks was perfectly cast as the cast away.
I:8465;1588;The movie starts with the premise that Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, is a Federal Express executive obsessed with time.
I:8465;1589;By the way, the scenes from the plane crash are particularly well done and seemed very realistic to me (never having been in a plane crash, I can't speak with absolute authority on that).
I:8465;1590;The story of filming the movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself.
I:8465;1591;One must admire the lengths to which Tom Hanks have gone in order to prepare for this role.
I:8465;1592;Yes, it could have been better, but it's still worth seeing.
I:8465;1593;great movie, kid appropriate, so its good for the whole family, well worth the the money, if you like this movie you would also like return to the blue lagoon.
I:8465;1594;"Good photography and pretty interesting even if Tom Hanks had few ""people"" to speak to on the island."
I:8465;1595;He bonds with a volleyball, Wilson, which represents many things: the protagonist's need for a friend, conscience, and is, with its blood.
I:8465;1596;stained face, even a reminder of the protagonist's mortality.
I:8465;1597;so much of the struggle on the island is so universal that people from all over the world could follow the sequences without the aid of subtitles.
I:8465;1598;Primitive and biblical themes are wonderfully developed: the making of fire, the arduous learning process of trial and error, the ecstasy of tasting food as if for the first time.
I:8465;1599;nevertheless, I still recommend this film for the very compelling island sequences, which highlight Hanks' talents better than I have ever seen.
I:8465;1600;mY REVIEW: This movie is marvelous!
I:8465;1601;This movie is powerful, emotional and inspirational!
I:8465;1602;One of the greatest adventure films ever, hoping to teach you a lesson, wanting you to open your eyes and cherish what you have, because it might all be gone in an instant.
I:8465;1603;CAST AWAY is a wonderful movie!
I:8465;1604;Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they like it will show it to you for free.
I:8465;1605;Acording to me, this is one of the finest performance by any actor in any genre.
I:8465;1606;The director has a great sense of storytelling and Tom Hanks is an amazingly talented and wonderful actor.
I:8465;1607;I love this movie as it symbolizes true cinema.
I:8465;1608;Had to share this amazing film with my 14 year old.
I:8465;1609;She loved it, as I knew she would!
I:8465;1610;Tom Hanks is my all time favorite!
I:8465;1611;One thing is for certain: Cast Away is an ambitious film.
I:8465;1612;He is remarkably effective in this role, commanding a great level of interest despite no character interaction whatsoever (well, a little bit, kind of .
I:8465;1613;This is a testimony for how brilliant Hanks is as an actor.
I:8465;1614;It's a simple but good story requiring a straightforward exposition and an equally simple but suitably triumphant close.
I:8465;1615;"racking
I:8465;1616;Hanks survives (obviously), and finds himself washed up on a deserted island.
I:8465;1617;"At first he struggles with his predicament
I:8465;1618;Watching him work is utterly engaging.
I:8465;1619;style intensity, but it's still completely captivating and I was quite taken by this aspect of the film.
I:8465;1620;It's an above average film, and Hanks performance is solid, but I recommend that the viewer make a getaway after Chuck's rescue.
I:8465;1621;other than this, a very entertaining film.
I:8465;1622;Tom Hanks performed very well in the movie Cast Away .
I:8465;1623;The extras are also wonderful including the documentaries and featurettes.
I:8465;1624;His films have been critically acclaimed as well as hugely successful, ranging from modest (That Thing You Do!
I:8465;1625;How does he do it?Well with Cast Away, Mr. King Midas strikes Gold again, with a simple tale of a man who crash lands on an island and must survive it's hardships for four years.
I:8465;1626;There are layers and layers of depth to this piece that is so compelling, if you're not emotional by the end, check yourself for a pulse.
I:8465;1627;those that love this film have already fallen in love with Wilson, a vollyball with a bloodpainted face, drawn by Chuck, to have as a companion.
I:8465;1628;Try being alone for four years and see how long it takes you to make up a friend to talk to.
I:8465;1629;But you take from Cast Away what you bring to it, and that's what the ending is about.
I:8465;1630;But my favorite is the Charlie Rose interview with Hanks, who is such a delight.
I:8465;1631;it's truly a great interview.
I:8465;1632;whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.
I:8465;1633;This was an interesting movie.
I:8465;1634;I found this to be a very powerful movie.
I:8465;1635;Some of the reviewers didn't like the fact that there was no happy ending, but I for one loved the ending.
I:8465;1636;It lets the audience draw its own conclusion, which I love.
I:8465;1637;tom Hanks' performance is amazing, and in a role where the lead actor must carry the movie for an hour while only talking to a volleyball, he is great.
I:8465;1638;I also like this movie for the way the special effects are used.
I:8465;1639;I prefer special effects that help tell the story, such as this or something like Terminator 2, where the menace of the T.1000 needs the special effects to come to fruition.
I:8465;1640;It clearly shows up movies such as The Phantom Menace, where the special effects are the story.
I:8465;1641;It will give new respect to the words movie magic.
I:8465;1642;It is truely an amazing film that has the viewer running through a gambit of emotions.
I:8465;1643;This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane (most realistically) crashes into the ocean.
I:8465;1644;this is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character.
I:8465;1645;"On the surface, Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to
I:8465;1646;His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash.
I:8465;1647;"Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need, which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls ""Wilson""."
I:8465;1648;finally, one day a piece of metal (from the plane?)
I:8465;1649;washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape.
I:8465;1650;He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island.
I:8465;1651;in any other movie, this would be the happy ending.
I:8465;1652;Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life.
I:8465;1653;And now he must find a way to move on with his.
I:8465;1654;the final scene, just before the credits roll, reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie.
I:8465;1655;This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering, pain, or tragedy that someone may go through, their life will always be worth living.
I:8465;1656;This is a moral and spritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another.
I:8465;1657;It is very entertaining and has a great viewpoint from Tom hanks character.
I:8465;1658;Once again, Tom Hanks gives his most powerful and pivotal performance in this well.
I:8465;1659;This movie gives us a sense of inspiration and hope.
I:8465;1660;Kudos and two thumbs up for this film, which was directed by, none other than, Robert Zemeckis.
I:8465;1661;this was funny in the beginning when he was getting angry at a ball.
I:8465;1662;Well, at least he still can find the Lord.
I:8465;1663;Good movie that makes you appreciate all you have.
I:8465;1664;This is definitely an entertaining movie.
I:8465;1665;It actually makes you think how you would survive if you were isolated on an island.
I:8465;1666;Tom did a great job acting.
I:8465;1667;It was all about him, very little other actors were introduced until the end of the movie Superb movie, I loved it.
I:8465;1668;arrived in perfect conditon,, thanks.
I:8465;1669;But the way he does what he needs to to stay alive, and to keep hope alive, is amazing.
I:8465;1670;The ending is very touching too.
I:8465;1671;great movie in my opinion.
I:8465;1672;Loved it was an amazing movie thought that the first half was very exhilarating and suspense packed loved the movie all in all !!!!!!
I:8465;1673;cast Away is a film that stands at the level of a masterpiece.
I:8465;1674;The storyline, which depicts the dramatic and exciting story of a lone, stranded survivor's struggle to stay alive, runs smoothly along.
I:8465;1675;The characters are well developed, the actors are talented and convincing in their roles and is a definite must.
I:8465;1676;Takes you to a place you wouldn't want to go, but become curious of to see how you would do in the same circumstances.
I:8465;1677;Robert Zemeckis, Academy Award winning director for Forest Gump, and Tom Hanks, the Academy Award winner for Best Actor for Forest Gump, teamed up again for this epic drama.
I:8465;1678;In my opinion this is Tom Hanks' finest film, he should have gotten Best Actor instead of Russel Crowe, and the special effects when the plane crashes are great as well.
I:8465;1679;All in all though, this is a great movie, and it shouldn't be missed.
I:8465;1680;The movie held my interest.
I:8465;1681;It is a tragic adventure with a smattering of romance that prompted the human nature in me to want a wonderfully positive outcome.
I:8465;1682;Imagine a fragile and utterly dependent entity filled with energy, song, and the joy of each new sunrise.
I:8465;1683;this solitude could have sown a deep spirituality and profound respect for all life.
I:8465;1684;solitude can be a path to enlightenment, as it has for many of history's sages.
I:8465;1685;Always carry a volleyball in your carry.
I:8465;1686;I love Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in everything they do.
I:8465;1687;That is how much I love this movie.
I:8465;1688;It was a family moment.
I:8465;1689;If you havent seen you, must.
I:8465;1690;Cast Away helps reshape what is really important in a person's life as it forces you to consider what are your true physical, emotional, social, and intellectual needs.
I:8465;1691;all of which is to survive with sanity and love.
I:8465;1692;Tom Hanks does an amazing job drawing in forcing the viewer to become empathetic with the main character.
I:8465;1693;"When I saw ""Cast Away"" in theaters back in the winter of 2000, I thought to myself on how brilliant the film was, and how brilliant the performance was from Academy."
I:8465;1694;"award winner Tom Hanks (""Philadelphia"", Best Actor, 1993)."
I:8465;1695;"This is pretty much the fourth film to be filmed in Memphis (the first three were John Grisham films based on his novels: ""The Firm"", ""The Client"", and ""The Rainmaker"")."
I:8465;1696;Chuck has a beautiful life with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt).
I:8465;1697;When Chuck gets an unexpected call on his pager, he decides to take it.
I:8465;1698;Chuck manages to survive the outcome of it and gets washed away to an island nearby.
I:8465;1699;"There he spends 4 years of his life fighting insanity by talking to a volleyball, in which he named ""Wilson"", and how he still manages to survive and figure out a way back home."
I:8465;1700;"Robert Zemeckis (""What Lies Beneath"") directed this movie with lots of emotion and powerful storytelling as well."
I:8465;1701;scenes footage, trailers, TV spots, commentaries, and more.
I:8465;1702;"released ""Cast Away"" again, this time as a one."
I:8465;1703;"But, all in all, this is Tom Hanks' best film since ""Philadelphia"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Green Mile""."
I:8465;1704;It is well written, superbly acted, the direction and production are impeccable and even now, more than ten years after release it is a mesmerizing experience.
I:8465;1705;My 13 year old enjoyed it and my 16 year old daughter couldn't stop asking questions.
I:8465;1706;Let the movie carry you.
I:8465;1707;This riveting movie further confirms Tom Hanks' greatness as an actor.
I:8465;1708;Everything he does is imbued with such honesty and truth.
I:8465;1709;Furthermore, he makes every reaction to his situation seem believable.
I:8465;1710;The one sly factor in Hanks' persona is his subtle, yet absolutely uproarious sense of humor: he indicates certain touches, ways of registering a situation with such deft irony you're laughing along with your tears.
I:8465;1711;Few actors are more spontaneously skilled than Hanks in registering a human emotion that everyone can relate to.
I:8465;1712;"The greatest gift an actor can have is the ability to make the audience feel, understand and react to, the character's emotions
I:8465;1713;He is the Every Man actor of our time.
I:8465;1714;Just a few minutes ago I was able to watch this movie on cable.
I:8465;1715;The diversity of emotions felt during the viewing was amazing.
I:8465;1716;It's an old movie, most people have probably seen this but it's still so good and honest.
I:8465;1717;It's an older movie but was fun to watch with my boys since they hadn't seen it yet : )
I:8465;1718;Still, it's worth watching at least once.
I:8465;1719;A good story, however, I wasn't pulled in until the plane crash and yes, it was a very good action scene.
I:8465;1720;"His determination to get off the island gives new meaning to ""never give up"" and his time adriff at sea was equally heart wrenching and incredibly lucky."
I:8465;1721;The insensativity of catering seafood as a welcome home party was both amusing and sad.
I:8465;1722;Sure, you've moved on and have a family now.you can explain all that but you at least show up.
I:8465;1723;That last bit of hope at the end of the movie, when he returns the one Fed.
I:8465;1724;Other than that, Cast Away is an entertaining film that reminds viewers how quickly and unpredictable the tide of life can be.
I:8465;1725;Cast Away is a movie that makes you take stock.
I:8465;1726;cast Away is also a very fine movie.
I:8465;1727;Tom Hanks is the finest of actors.
I:8465;1728;Hanks must carry this picture all by himself for well over half of the screen time.
I:8465;1729;That he does so with seeming ease is not only a credit to him as an actor, but is also the mark of a truly great director.
I:8465;1730;The best parts are the feature on survival techniques, a Charlie Rose interview, and the story of Wilson.
I:8465;1731;zemeckis' commentary is also a big, big plus.
I:8465;1732;There is so much more to this movie than what meets the eye.
I:8465;1733;i give Cast Away my wholehearted recommendation.
I:8465;1734;It's one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8465;1735;The plane crash feels so real, and Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of his generation.
I:8465;1736;Finding himself confronted with the Robinson Crusoe type challenges of making do with the sparse resources at his disposal, Hanks does a very nice job of working his way from the transition from the modern world to one where he has to depend solely on his own initiative.
I:8465;1737;i found the cinemetography of the movie quite striking with some really nice pictures of the ocean and island.
I:8465;1738;The film gives you a good sense of the smallness of the island and how great the size of the surrounding ocean.
I:8465;1739;It's an awesome movie and great act by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1740;They can educate, change opinions, or move a person to do something positive in there lives.
I:8465;1741;The last great movie I've seen in the theater was this one.
I:8465;1742;He is a very talented actor.
I:8465;1743;Every movie he makes is fantastic.
I:8465;1744;On the outside, the film is a great survival story of a man stranded on an uninhabitated island.
I:8465;1745;Chuck Noland, the main character played by Tom Hanks, finds several inventive ways to live off the land, and the viewer is brought into the film by observing Noland's actions and tactics in confronting the sobering isolation.
I:8465;1746;on a deeper level, this movie deals with some moving themes, expressed through powerfully symbolic methods.
I:8465;1747;In the first part of the movie, Chuck Noland (whose name is also metaphorical)is a top Federal Express employee obsessed with racing against time.
I:8465;1748;In the end, he has to deal with what fate has dictated to him.
I:8465;1749;Hanks compelling performance in the concluding scenes is moving and captivating.
I:8465;1750;His quest to claim domain over, elusive, fire and water alternately bring tears and laughter as does the four year battle with despair and hope.
I:8465;1751;Hanks conveyed, eloquently and subtly, the fear, confusion and beauty of his isolation.
I:8465;1752;If ever there was a perfect pairing of an actor and a part, this is it.
I:8465;1753;It takes genius to write about ordinary people thrown into extraordinary situations.
I:8465;1754;this movie was fortunate to profit from the considerable acting skills of Tom Hanks, who performs what ismostly a conversation with a coconut.
I:8465;1755;Cast Away with Tom Hanks is the story of survival after a plane crash and the evential survival skills facing our hero in this movie.
I:8465;1756;Excellent film with its story line and the eventual rescue in the end.
I:8465;1757;This is a spectacular movie.
I:8465;1758;The way he gets to the island is pretty freaky.
I:8465;1759;Then there is the plane crash, that one is really great, I think the second best (I think the best is in Final Destination).
I:8465;1760;I think that Tom Hanks is great, but I think he will never be as good as Forrest Gump.
I:8465;1761;Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances by any actor.
I:8465;1762;A good sense of humor as well.
I:8465;1763;one of my all time favorites.
I:8465;1764;I'll give you a hint.
I:8465;1765;When you realize that you can fully appreciate the movie.
I:8465;1766;I'm glad to see that at least one other person knows the truth (See: Extraordinary by Dr. Christopher Coleman).
I:8465;1767;Once you know this truth then the whole movie opens up to you.
I:8465;1768;Now that she has moved on what does it mean for the two of them?
I:8465;1769;I really liked the idea of this movie and with usually liking this kind of genre i was excpecting this to be a good film and was not disappointed.
I:8465;1770;Castaway is a story of hope in dispair and is not pretentious to this kind of desert island film, it's a good film that you should see at least twice.
I:8465;1771;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8465;1772;Tom Hanks is already one of the best actors ever and this movie just proves that.
I:8465;1773;it was in perfect condition and picture was very good.
I:8465;1774;Cast Away was once again very exciting to see again.
I:8465;1775;Quite possibly Tom Hanks' best film.
I:8465;1776;It's captivating and interesting, wonderfully acted and overall fantastic.
I:8465;1777;The steelbook is a great thing to own.
I:8465;1778;Tom Hanks has to carry this film pretty much on his own and he does an admirable job.
I:8465;1779;Meanwhile his family have given him up for dead and moved on with their lives.
I:8465;1780;Cast Away turns many of the romantic notions .
I:8465;1781;I am not a big Tom Hanks fan nor one of outdoor type adventure movies but have to say that cast away is quite a great film.
I:8465;1782;A film that should keep your attention well from the start to end and then some.
I:8465;1783;fiction, war or animated type picture but a tense drama that keeps you in suspense.
I:8465;1784;This movie is awe inspiring, as well as beutifally put together in a heart.
I:8465;1785;This movie creats an emotional feeling throughout and holds it to the end.
I:8465;1786;A great movie to see and to own.
I:8465;1787;In seeing Castaway on the big screen, my original synopsis of the movie was that it was an incredible journey into the mind of a brilliant director.
I:8465;1788;If anyone can make that work on the big screen, it's Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1789;This was a great movie and, even though I'm blind, I have no complaints.
I:8465;1790;Go out and get it for yourselves!
I:8465;1791;It was priced fairly and arrived quickly in excellent condition.
I:8465;1792;The product was in great condition.
I:8465;1793;Thanks for getting it here so fast and on time.
I:8465;1794;This is an excellent performance by Tom Hanks2.
I:8465;1795;The story and performance transcend the need for constant dialog3.
I:8465;1796;This is a gripping tale of survivalI also think such observations miss the point of the film entirely.
I:8465;1797;When he returns he finds everything he knew has changed.
I:8465;1798;This is the real story of Cast Away.
I:8465;1799;The pocket watch he checks so carefully has stopped.
I:8465;1800;"But in its' ""simplicity"" to me it manages to be as complete as it could have been, and that way being some kind of a simple ""masterpiece""."
I:8465;1801;the silence and the loneliness he feels is brilliant described the way he builds up a relationship with a soccer ball that he paints a face with his blood on.
I:8465;1802;What keeps him alive is the hope of seeing the love of his life again, and finally he takes the risk of setting out to the open ocean not wanting to die alone on that island.
I:8465;1803;"It's a ""modern"" drama (though timeless I believe) without pirates and treasures."
I:8465;1804;"so where some find ""Cast Away"" disturbingly boring others will find it moving and beautiful."
I:8465;1805;Because of the fantastic acting (as usual by Tom Hanks, also by Helen Hunt playing his girlfriend), the way we get involved in the lives of the lead characters here .
I:8465;1806;Cast Away is a one.
I:8465;1807;movie, and this way it stays with you for a while.
I:8465;1808;Cast Away reteams director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for their first film together since the Award winning Forrest Gump.
I:8465;1809;The survival scenes are sandwiched in between Chuck's life in Memphis pre and post island.
I:8465;1810;island scenes show Chuck as a time obsessed man, whose main goal is to make certain packages arrive on time.
I:8465;1811;Kelly gives Chuck a pocket watch and amongst his gifts is an engagement ring.
I:8465;1812;The crash is a fiery spectacle that shows off Mr. Zemeckis' skill as a director.
I:8465;1813;It is on the island where we see the acting skills that make Mr. Hanks the best in the business.
I:8465;1814;Mr. Hanks' draws our sympathy and we share in his frustrations.
I:8465;1815;The scenes on the island are worth watching to see this generation's greatest actor shine.
I:8465;1816;Hanks does a magnificent job of portraying hopelessness and the longing that kept the character alive and eventually brought him back to civilization.
I:8465;1817;the most compelling parts of the movie were dealing with the character's drive to survive on the island.
I:8465;1818;The fact that Zemekis spent so much of the movie on the island was ingenious!
I:8465;1819;The real wonder is how the movie keeps you entertained when silence is such a large portion of the movie.
I:8465;1820;It's in these times that we truely connect with the everyday man that Hank's is so brilliantly portraying.
I:8465;1821;Special effects and cinematography .
I:8465;1822;And Lord how I wanted to see those first 3 weeks off the island!!!
I:8465;1823;This is a great movie though.
I:8465;1824;Great details, fantastic story, Oscar worthy acting.
I:8465;1825;My 13 year old son loved this movie as did I.
I:8465;1826;You will like it as well as we did.
I:8465;1827;so that speaks well for the movie.
I:8465;1828;Once again Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Forrest Gump) proves that he is perhaps the best actor of the last 50 years with a tour.
I:8465;1829;He leaves his girlfriend Helen Hunt (Twister, As Good as it Gets) with a promise to return for New Year's.
I:8465;1830;But that shows you how wrapped up you become in the film without realizing it.
I:8465;1831;This is the kind of information I really like to see.
I:8465;1832;A good part on the creation of the plane crash and lots of footage of Tom Hanks just clowning around with the cast, crew and locals on the set in Russia, where very few people know the talented actor.
I:8465;1833;Tom Hanks does it again, I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of adventure.
I:8465;1834;Worth all the time in the world and if it could be longer, I'd prefer it.
I:8465;1835;How Tom Hanks performed this role is sublime.
I:8465;1836;If you get yourself into the movie you'll see.
I:8465;1837;Tom hanks is a brilliant actor and film works well all the way.
I:8465;1838;CAST AWAY was a pretty good film, except that it seemed to take forever.
I:8465;1839;The acting is excellent, of course .
I:8465;1840;especially when you've got the talent.
I:8465;1841;likes of Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in the same movie.
I:8465;1842;I thought Tom Hanks played his role very well and seemed very realistic.
I:8465;1843;And Helen Hunt was great, too.
I:8465;1844;Anyway, CAST AWAY is a great film with excellent acting and some of the best special effects of the year.
I:8465;1845;Still, my absolute favorite film and the film I think is the best movie of the year is ALMOST FAMOUS.
I:8465;1846;I totally recommend both films!
I:8465;1847;it was in great condition.
I:8465;1848;This is one of my husband's favorite movies.
I:8465;1849;There are so many ways in which you can compare life experiences with what the main character is going through.
I:8465;1850;disc special because of the interviews and commentaries that are included.
I:8465;1851;Would you go insane being all by yourself or would you enjoy the solitude?While some say this movie was too long and tested their patience level, it is a journey all on its own into the mind of a survivor.
I:8465;1852;"
I:8465;1853;Hope, creativity, perseverance and basic survival instincts keep him alive.
I:8465;1854;chuck is a man who can't sit still for 10 minutes and now he has to make friends with years of solitude and a volleyball (very funny look on his face when he is trying to create fire and the volleyball is hanging out watching him).
I:8465;1855;The spear fishing was pretty cool especially when he is out fishing from his raft in the open water.
I:8465;1856;Tom does some hilarious things.
I:8465;1857;"I was laughing out loud so many times during the ""silent"" times."
I:8465;1858;He makes very creative use out of ice skates (axe) and a dress (fishing net).
I:8465;1859;It is symbolic of him leaving his hurried world.
I:8465;1860;this was a very thoughtful movie.
I:8465;1861;You get to imagine what Tom is thinking and also when you watch it at home, you can talk about various aspects, like.
I:8465;1862;I say this because half the fun of this movie is talking about it while you are watching it.
I:8465;1863;"not only does this movie have romance (for me), it had great ""real man"" adventure for him."
I:8465;1864;We were totally intrigued, discussed all sorts of things as the movie progressed and really had a great time watching this movie.
I:8465;1865;You will be giving yourself the gift of escape.
I:8465;1866;An exotic location, gorgeous cinematography and a must for the unrushed viewer.
I:8465;1867;It was good but not great.
I:8465;1868;Romantic and dramatic as well as action filled.
I:8465;1869;we were on the edge of our seats!
I:8465;1870;Tom Hanks is THE best actor.
I:8465;1871;He holds the screen for the whole time he is by himself.
I:8465;1872;Helen Hunt is one of my favorite actors too and she really does a great job in this movie.
I:8465;1873;Very great special effects, especially the crash scene.
I:8465;1874;I recommend this to all Tom Hanks fans and to people who enjoy love stories and triumphs.
I:8465;1875;spirit stories, and so on.
I:8465;1876;def got me very excited.
I:8465;1877;overall the movie was nice but I was let down as I was expecting better, especially from a movie with such a great environment.
I:8465;1878;So you may want to hold onto your set.
I:8465;1879;Hanks really put himself out for this film, doing a magnificent and touching performance, and I am grateful.
I:8465;1880;"In ""Cast Away,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it."
I:8465;1881;and given something new to ponder: Life.
I:8465;1882;"ex who lives and dies by the clock
I:8465;1883;"And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival
I:8465;1884;what it is that really matters in life.
I:8465;1885;"Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland
I:8465;1886;"Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation
I:8465;1887;"The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place
I:8465;1888;A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe.
I:8465;1889;"The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this
I:8465;1890;But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart.
I:8465;1891;It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
I:8465;1892;Cast Away is an engrossing film that.
I:8465;1893;In the most intense and thought provoking scenes in the film, a man is torn from his life, his friends, family, and is drafted in to the ocean.
I:8465;1894;Chuck Noland, a some what now battered man, finally gets the courage to go against the waves, and the horrors that the ocean might bring by making a make.
I:8465;1895;When shaved and given a meal, Chuck Noland sets out on his new quest, being able to say to the world, What more can you bring to me?
I:8465;1896;I think this is a great film, shot with a low budget, you know Tom Hanks is not in it just for the money, the budget like I said is low, and just the atmosphere that Tom Hanks brings to the film is enough to see the film.
I:8465;1897;It is greatly written, and directed with exellent visuals and of course the beautiful Fiji island.
I:8465;1898;I hope I helped you in your descision to see this film!!
I:8465;1899;I thought Microsoft had it right because Instant Video works perfectly on my HP desktop computer running Windows Vista.
I:8465;1900;A real test of a mans courage and his will is go with life.
I:8465;1901;The movie itself touched on so many levels and had so many lessons to be learned.
I:8465;1902;The film itself was very well done.
I:8465;1903;Robert Z. is so talented and the camera work is amazing.
I:8465;1904;The settings are gorgeous, the plane crash is terrifying.
I:8465;1905;makes you feel like your there.
I:8465;1906;Tom Hanks did a superb job as the gratification.
I:8465;1907;generous use of the Federal Express name, premises and equipment meant that the movie had to tread awfully carefully (wouldn't Chuck open ALL the packages washed ashore?)
I:8465;1908;What impressed me, though, was that this movie always remained credible.
I:8465;1909;united with his girlfriend, Kelly, was believeable and sensitive.
I:8465;1910;We watched the movie last night and throughly enjoy the performance given by the entire cast but especially by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1911;Ok, i didnt give it 5 because, well it wasnt quite right.
I:8465;1912;I dont know what it was but it wasnt quite perfect.
I:8465;1913;I laughed more than once at hanks' antics, especially when he is fishing!Highlights are plentiful if you let yourself get involved, dreamworks once again work their magic, surely the biggest power in holliwood at the moment?!
I:8465;1914;The best plane crash in the history of cinema, i hope it's as good on the small screen!I admire hanks for a wonderful porformance, shame about a certain 'father to a murdered son', Russell Crow.
I:8465;1915;Tom hanks and dreamworks come together to produce a blockbuster with a bit of guts and a lot of heart.
I:8465;1916;my mind was completely captivated.
I:8465;1917;what an amazing film it was.
I:8465;1918;this is one of the best i had seen.
I:8465;1919;the four years friend for hank just float away quietly toward the great ocean.
I:8465;1920;and the moving music score had touch my heart twice.
I:8465;1921;a movie that really caught my heart and provoke my deepest thought of a man that had lost all civilazation suddenly.
I:8465;1922;a great movie not to be missed.
I:8465;1923;Tom Hanks is a great actor.
I:8465;1924;i really enjoy some movies with him, like the brilliant FORREST GUMP.
I:8465;1925;it's a really nice film, with a soberb interpretation from Hanks.
I:8465;1926;I absolutley love this movie.
I:8465;1927;Tom Hanks is fantastic,his facial expresions and body language change with the moment and situation and just pull you into his character.
I:8465;1928;I just love this flick!!
I:8465;1929;I found this movie to be very enjoyable to watch.
I:8465;1930;With one of the best and most believable crash sequences ever put on film, were gone the love.
I:8465;1931;Tom Hank's characters always seem to pull the audience in, making us care about what happens to them.
I:8465;1932;Great effort from the sound effects crew.
I:8465;1933;Extremely touching, with the falling rain a symbol of the many years of tears and separation.
I:8465;1934;But there is also the positive side.
I:8465;1935;An ending with the hope of a new beginning.
I:8465;1936;a film I can watch over.
I:8465;1937;Once again, a brilliant collaboration for actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis.
I:8465;1938;it was action packed then a great adventure, and finally an emotionally draining good drama!
I:8465;1939;act 2 was possibly the best segue in many many years!
I:8465;1940;kudos to a fine director, as usual mr. zemekis thank you sir and of course tom hanks for beautifully putting me as well as my family through a compelling and convincing array of all emotions we all loved wilson too!
I:8465;1941;ex was incredible as was the clarity of the film itself.
I:8465;1942;the island, waters, sunsets fairly burst with color and the 2nd disc is so packed with extras you may be there all day!
I:8465;1943;get it enjoy it it will be recognized as the classic it is.
I:8465;1944;Some may think this movie is extremely slow, but after watching it a few times it really grows on you.
I:8465;1945;Tom Hanks is at the top of his game in this movie.
I:8465;1946;Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie about him who works for FedEx and while he is flying on a FedEx plane the plane has problem with its cargo and the plane crashes into the Pacific.
I:8465;1947;I remember seeing this in the theater and when he finally makes fire the audience clapped for him.
I:8465;1948;You will actually cheer for him while he learns to survive on some remote island in the Pacific, I believe it was.
I:8465;1949;The ending will have wondering which way he turns either North, South, East, or West, I believe that is how life is.
I:8465;1950;This movie is a must see.
I:8465;1951;Just an incredably good movie.
I:8465;1952;Interesting story/concept, well acted, good script, well photographed.
I:8465;1953;i thought the ending was good.
I:8465;1954;Move on and move forward.
I:8465;1955;This is as much a commercial for Federal Express as it is a compelling character drama.
I:8465;1956;I give it two stars reluctantly.
I:8465;1957;I want to get right to the film.
I:8465;1958;They are ruining a very good thing.
I:8465;1959;They achieved this by chopping the movie into four parts: 1) the prequel to the arrival to the island (including the very exciting plane crash sequence, easily the best part of the movie and one of the best plane crashes I have seen), 2) Tom Hanks's time on the island, the longest segment in the movie, 3) his escape from the island, and 4) his arrival home.
I:8465;1960;the one real shortcoming in the film is the difficulty of coming up with much dramatic action.
I:8465;1961;The strength in the film is the fact that they did such an incredible job of overcoming so many of the limitations.
I:8465;1962;tom Hanks was great, as usual.
I:8465;1963;Near the end of his time on the island, he has really shaped up.
I:8465;1964;But, for what it is worth, the supporting cast was solid enough.
I:8465;1965;there was, however, one major star of the movie other than Tom Hanks, and that was the island itself.
I:8465;1966;Dramatic, beautiful, and yet, just forbidding enough, it was the perfect costar for Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1967;so, not a perfect movie, but nonetheless a very good one.
I:8465;1968;And if you enjoy Tom Hanks's work, as I do, it will provide a couple of hours of great entertainment, IF you can get past the opening menu.
I:8465;1969;First, while I thought he deserved the Oscar more than Crowe (I am a HUGE Russell Crowe fan, and I definitely thought he deserved the Oscar for THE INSIDER, but THE GLADIATOR, while good, is not one of his very best roles), I thought the Oscar for best actor should have gone to someone who was not even nominated: Jamie Bell for BILLY ELIOTT.
I:8465;1970;Cast Away is an entertaining movie about an extremely punctual man who gets stranded on an island.
I:8465;1971;The move has some really great moments.
I:8465;1972;It is great to see how Tom Hanks must adapt to his environment.
I:8465;1973;I just want a good survival movie, so the character builing story of the him and the girl does not appeal too me.
I:8465;1974;This is an entertaining movie.
I:8465;1975;Cast Away is one of those all.
I:8465;1976;too rare, brilliant films that is perfectly structured, perfectly conceived, and perfectly acted.
I:8465;1977;The first act introduces the main character and shows his life up until his being stranded on a desert island.
I:8465;1978;The second act, the major bulk of the film, is a tour de force, one man character piece about the struggles to survive all by oneself.
I:8465;1979;To craft a film in which most of the action involves one actor by himself for around an hour or more of screen time, and make it absorbing, insightful, and never boring is an amazing achievement, one which can be attributed to the great direction of Robert Zemeckis and the wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, who manages to make his character both an everyman and three.
I:8465;1980;By seeing every creature comfort he has grown up with instantly snatched away from him, and watching a modern man have to utilize talents of survival he didn't even know he had, we the audience are rewarded with the experience of seeing a character closer than usually happens in film.
I:8465;1981;Watch this movie for one of the most fascinating character portrayals in recent film history,and for the great performance by Tom Hanks.
I:8465;1982;Notice that the title is not Castaway, the noun, but the verb cast away, giving the movie much richer, symbolic levels of meaning than what the former would have been.
I:8465;1983;This movie is a perfect example of just how much an actor's contribution can elevate a mediocre story.
I:8465;1984;I enjoyed Cast Away the first time out.
I:8465;1985;Castaway is very engaging after the plane crashes as Chuck Noland (Hanks) must strategise for his survival and rescue.
I:8465;1986;It is kind of sweet to see how he remains consistant to that trait even when he is alone on an island.
I:8465;1987;He endures many painful hardships that will have you wincing and covering your eyes at times.
I:8465;1988;It makes you very happy when he finally has a little victory.
I:8465;1989;His relationship with Wilson the volleyball is a memorable touch.
I:8465;1990;Before he becomes stranded the film needs to establish Hanks is dedicated to his job, has a girlfriend he hopes to marry, and has the beginnings of a toothache.
I:8465;1991;story about a package from an anonymous customer and a friend who's wife has cancer.
I:8465;1992;It is a good film bookended between a dragging mediocre film.
I:8465;1993;No less than five featurettes, including Hank's interview with Charlie Rose, Artwork, storyboards and commercials and trailers for the film.
I:8465;1994;Plus a full length commentary by Director Robert Zemekis and crew.
I:8465;1995;If you love Castaway you will certainly love this disc.
I:8465;1996;That's about it for plot in this beautiful but ordinary adventure nicely directed by Robert Zemeckis.
I:8465;1997;"word title is that our hero experience some kind of spiritual enlightenment from the enforced ""casting away"" of civilization's ephemera."
I:8465;1998;disc set includes enthusiastic commentary from Zemeckis, a startling featurette on the remarkable and wonderfully invisible digital effects and much more.
I:8465;1999;It is amazing how good of an actor Tom Hanks is!
I:8465;2000;He spends about 45 minutes of the movie not talking and still is able to draw you into the character and plot of the movie.
I:8465;2001;I find that so incredible!
I:8465;2002;This movie is really good.
I:8465;2003;watching him struggle to survive on the island, seeing the development of his 'relationship' with Wilson is hilarious and witnessing his return to civilization is hardwarming.
I:8465;2004;And he did well in this role as well.
I:8465;2005;A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island.
I:8465;2006;This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well.
I:8465;2007;And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending.
I:8465;2008;A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.
I:8465;2009;and it's not easy for a film to be both interesting AND quiet so yes good job Cast Away.
I:8465;2010;I was surprised that this kept my attention.
I:8465;2011;Was smart enough to realize that the opening scene of the sculpter would be tied into with the FedEx delivery.
I:8465;2012;Left one's mind to the imagination to fill in the blank.
I:8465;2013;Zemeckis thought that Hanks and Hunt becoming lovers again after all that time would not seem believable by the audience, so he changed it to reflect a more realistic ending of Hanks moving on with life.
I:8465;2014;"Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's ""Survivor"" and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away."""
I:8465;2015;but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking.
I:8465;2016;Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.
I:8465;2017;the story is a simple one: Chuck Noland is a classic type.
I:8465;2018;Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.
I:8465;2019;Cast Away is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality.
I:8465;2020;The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love .
I:8465;2021;"as it is, ""Cast Away"" is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations."
I:8465;2022;The movie is well known so I will just state I was very happy with the picture/sound on this disc as others have stated.
I:8465;2023;Was nice to revisit the movie, not sure how many times one would want to replay it but it has some great demo scenes!
I:8465;2024;Great movie, one of Tom Hanks best movies ever, the storyline, the scenery, the ending.
I:8465;2025;all make for a super entertaining movie that is unmatched in recent times in it's genre.
I:8465;2026;i was totally blown away by the whole thing and i would rate it with some of the best!
I:8465;2027;One thing for sure though this is a great movie and anybody will enjoy it.
I:8465;2028;Robert Zemeckis is an extraordinarily compelling filmmaker, and he knows when to keep things seemingly simple.
I:8465;2029;"Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale
I:8465;2030;"The plane crash itself jolts your senses
I:8465;2031;Still, you will not likely see a more creatively charged big.
I:8465;2032;budget movie this season, nor a performance as riveting at Hanks'.
I:8465;2033;The device of Wilson the volleyball as Hanks' only friend is brilliantly executed, with an emotional payoff as surprising as it is deftly handled.
I:8465;2034;And you know it is good: adventure, action, escape, burdens, lost loves, and survival under harsh circumstances.
I:8465;2035;This is a mix of Robinson Caruso and The Count of Monte Cristo (while Dante is in prison).
I:8465;2036;you'll want to see it about every third year.
I:8465;2037;Even though it is a good film with some good performances, it is marred by a slow third act, but is definitely a commendable effort.
I:8465;2038;It's a nice presentation for a good (but not great) movie.
I:8465;2039;I love this movie, but in the blu.
I:8465;2040;the crash scene was very well film.
I:8465;2041;The acting was superb all around.
I:8465;2042;Going with Tom, was the smart move.
I:8465;2043;It is a THUMBS UP!
I:8465;2044;This film is just about perfect, another successful Hanks/Zemeckis/Silvestri collaboration.
I:8465;2045;Tom Hanks demonstrates again his renowned commitment and style.
I:8465;2046;Robert Zemeckis is on top of his game here and deserves as much credit for what isn't in the film as for what is.
I:8465;2047;It says it all, carries it right over the top, speaks to a place inside beyond the movie.
I:8465;2048;See this movie and you'll know what I mean.
I:8465;2049;This movie is very good except for one part in the beginning I really enjoyed it.
I:8465;2050;It really leaves you with a lot to ponder.
I:8465;2051;I've bought just 24 in the past year and I just bought my first Blu.
I:8465;2052;ray discs, I bought my first Blu.
I:8465;2053;But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu.
I:8465;2054;It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.
I:8465;2055;This movie is another great one from his roster.
I:8465;2056;It may not outshine Back to the Future, and Forrest Gump, but it was really good.
I:8465;2057;Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance, as well as Helen Hunt even though she only takes up about 30 minutes of screen time.
I:8465;2058;The film was great and it really made you believe you were stranded with Tom's character, Chuck.
I:8465;2059;It is a great film all around.
I:8465;2060;It is another way that he is able to stay alive.
I:8465;2061;His friend Wilson is supposedley another strength that keeps him alive.
I:8465;2062;One of Tom Hanks great films.
I:8465;2063;I like adventure movies about boat wrecks and the people who have to find a way to survive.
I:8465;2064;Tom Hanks was great and the metamorphosis of his body over the years he spent on the Island was amazing.
I:8465;2065;Saw it when it first came out and I was like.
I:8465;2066;But now that im in love (sigh!)
I:8465;2067;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8465;2068;I give it 10 stars!
I:8465;2069;Hanks gives us a wonderful performance in this heartbreaking movie.
I:8465;2070;An award winning movie definately worth watching!
I:8465;2071;Cast Away is a very powerful and emotional film.
I:8465;2072;It was amazing to see the transformations that Tom Hanks took both physically and mentally.
I:8465;2073;The most emotional impact took place when his friend was lost at sea.
I:8465;2074;It allows us to come to realize how much we take for granted and how we should appreciate everything we have.
I:8465;2075;It broke my heart to see how he returned home after so many years to find his one true love, played by Helen Hunt, married to another man.
I:8465;2076;This movie was very powerful and I think that everyone should go see it.
I:8465;2077;Unbeatable price . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I:8465;2078;This gives him someone to hold onto in his heart as a reason to survive .
I:8465;2079;His need for human companionship is demonstrated, of course, in his turning a volleyball .
I:8465;2080;He is determined to do his job and deliver this package (though perhaps a bit late).
I:8465;2081;Thus, Zemeckis shows that by staying true to his inner voice, maintaining hope in impossible circumstances and seeing it through to the bitter end .
I:8465;2082;Movie Summary: Chuck Noland works for Federal Express.
I:8465;2083;He tells her he will be right back, but we all know by the title of the movie that he doesn't keep his promise.
I:8465;2084;I liked the island part the best.
I:8465;2085;It was the most intriguing and interesting.
I:8465;2086;I enjoyed the movie but found it was only good, and not great.
I:8465;2087;If you want to know everything about Cast Away, now you can.
I:8465;2088;This is a great movie my whole family can see.
I:8465;2089;This movie will have you examining your life.
I:8465;2090;Wilson was very funny, and smart.
I:8465;2091;Absolutely ove this movie and it came in great condition and right on time.
I:8465;2092;And goes on board the plane.
I:8465;2093;Chuck manages to stay alive.
I:8465;2094;I loved this movie a lot !
I:8465;2095;but I still liked the movie alot.
I:8465;2096;If you are looking for a good movie that will make you say WOW.
I:8465;2097;Be grateful for what you have and live simple.
I:8465;2098;This movie is a good movie for teens and older.
I:8465;2099;My husband has decided this is his favorite movie.
I:8465;2100;Tom Hanks is an excellent actor and I would recommend this to anyone who loves the T. hanks.
I:8465;2101;Amazing film from start to finish tom hanks is a star in his own right without cast without stand ins
I:8465;2102;He is such a skillful actor as to invite critique on the miniscule at the expense of seeing the overall appeal of the film.
I:8465;2103;It is solitary and as such requires great emtional content which is visceral and believable, it also in need of great humanity and Hanks has the ability to deliver on all scores.
I:8465;2104;You feel his isolation, frustration and fear in a way that is palpable and intense.
I:8465;2105;His sense of alienation and irony is delivered with perfect pitch in the last section of the film and the film leaves one with a mixed sense of fear and hope, undoubtedly the main characters displaced internal dilemma.
I:8465;2106;it may not be heavy on plot and action but this film is more about the extremes of the human condition and survival instinct and it also stands as an intense study of Hanks craft at it's best.
I:8465;2107;the storyline was also strong through the early and middle parts of the movie.
I:8465;2108;Some truly great moments of drama and human insight.
I:8465;2109;I cried at the end.
I:8465;2110;As usual Tom Hanks is great and does an excellent perfomance once he lands on the island.
I:8465;2111;On the overall scale it does make one appreciate every moment of life as we never know what tomorrow will bring.
I:8465;2112;This movie is a classic, well done and very entertaining.
I:8465;2113;I would highly recommend it to anyone.
I:8465;2114;Tom Hanks does a great job.
I:8465;2115;I couldn't stop watching it, no matter how stupid I thought it was I just thought any moment Tom Hanks is going to do something extraordinary and blow me away, I can't miss it!I was home alone, folding towels, thought, I'll enjoy a good Tom Hanks movie.
I:8465;2116;I have to say, Hank shocked me!
I:8465;2117;This movie was a great movie feturing a UPS manager played by tom hanks who gets stuck on an island in the south Pacific .
I:8465;2118;some boxes from the airplain he was travaling on found their way to the island and saved his life .
I:8465;2119;It's surprising just how good `Cast Away' is.
I:8465;2120;The location and scenery are also amazing and the direction shows it off to excellent effect.
I:8465;2121;It actually become quite touching to see him interact with an inanimate object and must be one of the most unique on.
I:8465;2122;This is a simple premise, excellently executed and although I've seen this film many times it never gets boring or any less gripping.
I:8465;2123;6 years after the masterpiece that was Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite to bring another masterpiece to the big screen.
I:8465;2124;But this film belongs to Hanks, who earned his fifth Oscar nomination with his very superb performance and I can't wait for what Hanks and Zemeckis come up with next.
I:8465;2125;Robert Zemeckis has surpassed himself so greatly that when you get out of the theatre you will forgive him for making Contact, Forest Gump and What Lies Beneath.
I:8465;2126;Tom Hanks has once more given a performance that will literally touch your soul.
I:8465;2127;It is true that on those rare occasions that Hollywood tries it can still create magic.
I:8465;2128;Furthermore, what else can I say but the fact that Tom Hanks can hold a film together all by himself.
I:8465;2129;He will be definitely a favourite among the Oscar nominees this year.
I:8465;2130;p. s: All those who love good cinema must definitely NOT lose this film!
I:8465;2131;Tom Hanks is a fine actor.
I:8465;2132;He does a memorable job in this film.
I:8465;2133;He conveys the agony of isolation with lively intensity.
I:8465;2134;The viewer shares his struggles with sympathy as he draws you into his daily acts of survival.
I:8465;2135;Hanks is a superb actor.
I:8465;2136;the transformation of a shallow man into someone bringing hidden abilities to bear on a difficult situation is a favourite Hollywood theme.
I:8465;2137;If it's done well, we can all identify with the individual.
I:8465;2138;This is Hanks' special talent.
I:8465;2139;He's done it elsewhere, and he does it superbly here.
I:8465;2140;Thrown on his own resources on a lonely Pacific island, Chuck Noland must develop new skills and strengths.
I:8465;2141;He carries the film in splendid isolation.
I:8465;2142;that isolation, given the cast, is this film's greatest shortcoming.
I:8465;2143;Bringing Helen Hunt into this film in bookend scenes at the beginning and end is to do an outstanding actress a great disservice.
I:8465;2144;Hanks calls I'll be right back!
I:8465;2145;if you're a Hanks fan, this is a film to view once.
I:8465;2146;If you want a captivating story, well presented and rich with innovation, you'll be only partly satisfied.
I:8465;2147;At first, I thought the movie was hilarious, but then it takes a very serious turn.
I:8465;2148;The dynamic that Hanks displays throughout the movie is incredible: the definite bright spot.
I:8465;2149;Tom Hanks has the golden touch and it seems that every film he is involved with is a hit.
I:8465;2150;It could have alot to do with he is a good actor, or it could be that he picks all of the best films to do which he has done with Cast Away.
I:8465;2151;What follows is one mans tale of survival and determination, which is told oin the best possible way.
I:8465;2152;Definitely see the film, but this is really another character study.
I:8465;2153;the ending of Cast Away was cinematic poetry.
I:8465;2154;It shows a shallowness in the moviemaker's understanding of people both in the Tom Hank's character and in audiences.
I:8465;2155;I did think Meg Ryan's reactions to Tom Hank's release were well done and authentic.
I:8465;2156;But this is a movie you watch to be entertained not to analyze!Tom Hank's is trying too hard to be taken seriously as a great character actor.
I:8465;2157;when we watch Cast Away, we're watching Tom Hanks, and America loves Tom Hanks.
I:8465;2158;Everything Deniro does with the character fits in perfectly.
I:8465;2159;Robert Deniro never draws attention to himself in a movie.
I:8465;2160;He draws attention to the character he is playing.
I:8465;2161;I sense that many of the great ones were before my time.
I:8465;2162;Meryl Streep is one who learns accents well, learns to do Irish step dancing, etc to prepare for roles, but can you imagine her trying to play some of the characters Julia Roberts has played?
I:8465;2163;And Elivs Presley fans this movie has about 4 of his songs.
I:8465;2164;And goes on board the plane.
I:8465;2165;Chuck manages to stay alive.
I:8465;2166;Perfect film for Tom Hanks fans!
I:8465;2167;shot on film, Cast Away presents a very nice appearance on Blu Ray and, compared to my Standard Definition copy, an overall improvement.
I:8465;2168;Color resolution is fairly realistic and skin tones are accurate and not overly saturated.
I:8465;2169;Focus can be soft in some place but contrast is quite good.
I:8465;2170;The Mbps appeared to average nicely in the high 30's and low 40's.
I:8465;2171;The entire first 30 minutes of film's audio is definitely demo worthy.
I:8465;2172;The music score immerses you as it is steered throughout the entire home theater's audio system.
I:8465;2173;Still, rain fall and storms throughout the film, as well as ocean waves, whale calls and more make great use of all your surround speakers and LFE sub channel.
I:8465;2174;I must admit that I was surprised by the outstanding audio editing and sound reproduction.
I:8465;2175;this film was certainly a major hit when it was released and it still retains its movie legs.
I:8465;2176;This is a great movie of perseverance, survival, companionship, loyalty, hope, desperation, strength, knowledge, love and life.
I:8465;2177;This is a must see!
I:8465;2178;Cast Away sees Hanks give one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot.
I:8465;2179;the opening part of the film introduces us to the life of Chuck Noland (Hanks).
I:8465;2180;He works for FedEx and is obsessed with time.
I:8465;2181;He manages to swim ashore and finds himself alone on an island.
I:8465;2182;This isn't a new idea, but the execution is excellent.
I:8465;2183;Noland is used to a comfortable life and has to learn how to survive in his new surroundings.
I:8465;2184;How will he escape and make his way back to civilization?I enjoy Cast Away because it's such a peaceful movie.
I:8465;2185;It helps us realize what it is like to be completely alone.
I:8465;2186;It's an examination of how human beings think, and that always appeals to me.
I:8465;2187;Hanks' performance is excellent (as always), saving the movie from an utter disaster.
I:8465;2188;CAST AWAY is a great film full of heart and soul.
I:8465;2189;disc set full of extras that'll make you feel closer to Chuck Noland and Wilson!
I:8465;2190;This movie is kind of old but its a classic.
I:8465;2191;Tom Hanks is a good actor.
I:8465;2192;But the end of the movie is the best part.
I:8465;2193;Tom hanks does a great job with this one, he acts just like any one of us would If we were on a deserted island.
I:8465;2194;In a word this movie is great
I:8465;2195;Except for the sappy love story line this is a gritty movie about survival.
I:8465;2196;Cast Away is a good movie.
I:8465;2197;But either way this movie was interesting on all the way's he came up with to stay alive for four years.
I:8465;2198;Now that he is back you can see in Kelly eyes that she wishes she could leave her husband for her true love.
I:8465;2199;In the end it seemed he was going to find love in another woman.
I:8465;2200;Sometimes life has a way of putting us in situations that test our ability to survive a traumatic event.
I:8465;2201;We have to rely on our instincts, use what available resources we have at our disposal, and keep hope, as well as ourselves, alive.
I:8465;2202;We emerge from our experience with greater wisdom, no longer able to exist in the world as we once did, because our perspective has changed.
I:8465;2203;And we become better people, more acutely aware of what's important in life.
I:8465;2204;Tom Hanks gives a stunning performance.
I:8465;2205;It is beautifully photographed and scripted.
I:8465;2206;Cast Away is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8465;2207;This is one of those 20 star movies that EVERYONE should see.
I:8465;2208;And the acting Hanks put into this was amazing.
I:8465;2209;He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.
I:8465;2210;The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.
I:8465;2211;with great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.
I:8465;2212;He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.
I:8465;2213;"married girlfriend who announces he ""is the love of her life."""
I:8465;2214;She goes unwillingly back to her family.
I:8465;2215;tom Hanks is marvelous in his role.
I:8465;2216;"(It seems I forever say the same thing, because he is always ""marvelous in his role."")"
I:8465;2217;What is amazing is how he keeps your total attention and interest whether he is building a raft or talking to a volleyball.
I:8465;2218;I resisted seeing Cast Away for months.
I:8465;2219;What kind of decent film is that?
I:8465;2220;Tom Hanks is riveting in an Oscar.
I:8465;2221;At one point, he even shouts Tick Tock!
I:8465;2222;It's fascinating to see what happens to a man who was once defined by the shortness of time, suddenly forced to grapple with more idle time than anyone could want.
I:8465;2223;The ensuing battle of wit and survival held my attention completely (contrary to my expectations).
I:8465;2224;The movie is inspirational in showing how strong the human spirit can be.
I:8465;2225;there are also fine performances by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth (Sex And The City's Mr. Big!)
I:8465;2226;The bonus disc is terrific.
I:8465;2227;It even includes interviews with the very interesting primitive technology experts consulted during the movie's production.
I:8465;2228;you can see and feel how deep that thought was.
I:8465;2229;I prefer to express the emotion in this movie.
I:8465;2230;Castaway, in a quick capsulation, is the end of a man's life due to being stranded on an uncharted island after a plane crash, the loss of the love of his life, and in the final minutes, realizing he has a whole new life to begin.
I:8465;2231;A life with more possibilties than his previous one.
I:8465;2232;The fact that he survives is a miracle.
I:8465;2233;Hanks is superb in the transformation of personalities that surface.
I:8465;2234;Until he is able to create fire.
I:8465;2235;This connection of blood, creates the alterego Hanks imprints upon Wilson.
I:8465;2236;While it appears he is going insane, this is the key to his surviving, as well as his love for his fiance, played by Helen Hunt.
I:8465;2237;it is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me.
I:8465;2238;The realization of both he and Hunt, that their lives had moved on, was at the least, powerfully emotional.
I:8465;2239;while this film recieved mixed reviews when it came out, it has to be viewed again.
I:8465;2240;Now take away all that you have and all your family and friends and, for that matter everything you have, how would you deal with it?
I:8465;2241;A volleyball might just become a good friend.
I:8465;2242;So I recommend that you watch this movie but don't watch it for a survivalist action adventure flick watch it for what it is, a statement on the human condition and just how one man copes with what life throws his way.
I:8465;2243;That pretty much sums it up.
I:8465;2244;oK, I'll tell you a bit more.
I:8465;2245;He finds a football washed up on shore and it becomes his best friend.
I:8465;2246;He paints a face on it, gives it a name and has full blown conversations with it.
I:8465;2247;He becomes a fully functioning human being again.
I:8465;2248;Tom Hanks does very well in a difficult role, and the movie handles the ancillary aspects of a long.
I:8465;2249;term disappears ably, but this is a movie that is really only good the first time you see it.
I:8465;2250;The direction is very good and the movie is not burdened by uneccesary musical scores or hammy special effects.
I:8465;2251;Everythign is shot in a very documentary style and the few special effects are all used only to advance the story, so the direction is good.
I:8465;2252;The film's ability to deal with very ordinary people is really where it is at its best.
I:8465;2253;I enjoyed it, but I won't watch it again
I:8465;2254;Magnificent film, and for one chief reason: Tom Hanks.
I:8465;2255;It's that sublime emotion that stirs in your gut whenever you see your friends and co. workers for the first time after not having seen them in a while.
I:8465;2256;Hanks portrays it well, and the superb, simplistic direction by Robert Zemekis gives it gravity.
I:8465;2257;"See the movie
I:8465;2258;A Fed Ex truck turns the corner and picks up a package from an artists barn that is home to a workshop which creates wings as a form of art(This film is full of symbolism).
I:8465;2259;Life for him revolves around time and it is the perfect job for him because Fed Ex is The World On Time .
I:8465;2260;He makes it home and has Christmas dinner with his girlfriend Kelly Frears(Helen Hunt).
I:8465;2261;He carries this entire film by being on screen by himself for the majority of the film.
I:8465;2262;The commentary features insight from Robert Zemekis and many members of his crew.
I:8465;2263;The extras are composed of special effects vignettes, multiple documentaries, a storyboard to film comparison, and two theatrical trailers and many T. v. spots.
I:8465;2264;This is a film to own and everytime you watch, you will notice more interesting things about it.
I:8465;2265;Wilson was the best part.
I:8465;2266;There is a well acted scene by Tom Hanks where he gets very excited about the fire he builds.
I:8465;2267;Great movie, even better acting!
I:8465;2268;This is the perfect movie about someone stranded on an island.
I:8465;2269;Excellent acting by everyone (Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt et al), excellent directing (Robert Zemeckis), excellent writing (William Broyles Jr.), and excellent scenery make for a perfect movie.
I:8465;2270;then he delivered the 1 PACKAGE he kept from the trip and SURPRISE he meets a beautiful women who anyone with a brain figures is his soulmate.
I:8465;2271;Very good acting by Tom Hanks, this is a very good movie, I watched it several times and will watch it again
I:8465;2272;but even though he is the only one, it gives the movie such a powerfull feeling and emotion created by that man and the place he is on, that those 90% of the film is the thing that is keeping you watching till the very end of the credits.
I:8465;2273;He is the perfect choice to play the stranded man who lives on a totally deserted island for a long time.
I:8465;2274;His acting is what keeps the movie alive for sure.
I:8465;2275;the power of the film lies in the lonelyness.
I:8465;2276;The brilliance also lies in the sounds of the island.
I:8465;2277;It was a terrific move of the filmmakers to have no music at all when the main character is on the island.
I:8465;2278;It gives a sense of pure realism and it gives the feeling that you are right there with him.
I:8465;2279;but when there is music, Alan Silvestri has composed a brilliant theme that brings the emotion up in you.
I:8465;2280;and if you have 5.1 surround sound like I have, the sounds and the music will be an even greater experience.
I:8465;2281;"Get those tissues ready, and be pulled into the world of ""Cast Away"", a film you won't forget and leaves an everlasting memory in your mind."
I:8465;2282;Tom hanks is a amazing actor and there aren't to many actor's and actress that could have pulled this part off and as for the how the blue ray looks it's amazing with all the iconic scene's in the movie
I:8465;2283;You get two discs jam packed with commentary, deleted scenes, great audio\video, and hours and hours of fine family fun.
I:8465;2284;it was called robinson crusoe, and that's a classic.
I:8465;2285;Although many people enjoy the high.
I:8465;2286;The movie begins with a beautiful image: the desolate Texas plains.
I:8465;2287;As the movie moves along, we are introduced to Chuck Noland, a live.
I:8465;2288;I found this middle section to be intriguing because it is a kind of silent movie: visual pictures are painted and we don't need dialogue or a cheesy, sappy score to ruin it.
I:8465;2289;I think this is the best attribute of the movie: Silvestri wrote only a 10.
I:8465;2290;As Chuck is found and he rediscovers himself, we are treated with fascinating twists.
I:8465;2291;felt ending leaves much to the imagination.
I:8465;2292;A visual feast for all.
I:8465;2293;The best movie ever made.
I:8465;2294;Simply put, this film will go down as a classic.
I:8465;2295;Tom Hanks did an excellent job as Chuck Noland in this film.
I:8465;2296;From a very real plane crash to life on the island and back again, he is able to catch the viewer from the beginning and take them on this journey.
I:8465;2297;Not only is it an exhaustive journey on a deserted island but it takes you on Chuck's journey to step back and take another look at his life.
I:8465;2298;This movie shows that we have to stop and take a look around us and see what really is happening.
I:8465;2299;This film does just that via Chuck Noland.
I:8465;2300;the other wonderful thing about this movie is the ending.
I:8465;2301;i had a school project due on this movie and I count find in stores.
I:8465;2302;This is a great movie, but I just wasn't impressed with Amazon.
I:8465;2303;eventually he has enough and makes a daring venture on a makeshift raft in order to find freedom (or maybe just get off the island).
I:8465;2304;This is an interesting movie, not really entertaining, but interesting.
I:8465;2305;and I waited AND WAITED for the movie to actually get going.
I:8465;2306;From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival.
I:8465;2307;A fascinating, believable, and thought.
I:8465;2308;provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows you in this movie to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey.
I:8465;2309;I just assumed since it made well over $100 million in the United States, and everyone loves Tom Hanks so much, that the majority of people rated it very highly.
I:8465;2310;When a movie is really good, it exceeds those expectations.
I:8465;2311;I can't for the life of me see how a movie about a guy stranded on an island where there aren't any cannibals or wild animals craving human flesh can be exciting.
I:8465;2312;i enjoyed the movie when he wasn't in an airplane or on an island.
I:8465;2313;that's good and relatively interesting.
I:8465;2314;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8465;2315;The title screens are pretty cool.
I:8465;2316;The movie is also interesting.
I:8465;2317;This is Robert Zemeckis's probably greatest movie he ever created.
I:8465;2318;This is an excellent story, told in a way you don't see very often these days.
I:8465;2319;The plane crash is as realistic as anything you will see, I was flying within a month and it had me in a panic just thinking about it.
I:8465;2320;A thoroughly enjoyable movie and I highly recommend it.
I:8465;2321;He has made some good decisions in the past including Forest Gump , Saving Private Ryan and now Cast Away .
I:8465;2322;All three of these movies were rather long in length and it works great.
I:8465;2323;Tom Hanks' incredible change in body composition in the movie really shows how dedicated he was and adds a lot to the cinematic experience.
I:8465;2324;He goes from a well fed FED.
I:8465;2325;It was really brave of Tom Hanks to accept doing this movie knowing that he would be the only character on screen for a large portion of the film.
I:8465;2326;He held the audience's attention well and this movie is a success.
I:8465;2327;Although Gladiator was a great movie, Tom Hanks seals the deal for best actor by creating the special relationship he created with a soccer ball.
I:8465;2328;Wilson should have won best supporting actor as well.
I:8465;2329;Tom Hanks gives an outstanding Oscar calibre performance as a time.
I:8465;2330;The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re.
I:8465;2331;He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it.
I:8465;2332;This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film.
I:8465;2333;This is a film that was made to make people think.
I:8465;2334;The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life?
I:8465;2335;The premise was compelling _ what happens when a typically hide.
I:8465;2336;The true drama of this story took place inside Chuck Nolan's head.
I:8465;2337;I have seen this movie on HBO, and I had multiple feelings to it.
I:8465;2338;amazement at what a person will do to survive under the most desperate circumstances.
I:8465;2339;I also felt that what happened to Chuck was a matter of fate.
I:8465;2340;Cast Away is a movie that will evoke your emotions as it did with me.
I:8465;2341;I believe this is one of Tom Hanks' best film.
I:8465;2342;Definitely a must have in a Blu.
I:8465;2343;From the opening scene to the ending scene, I sat in my small theatre seat captivated with the troubling and uplifting story that was told.
I:8465;2344;I found myself from time to time, gripping the sides of my seat.
I:8465;2345;Tom Hanks always picks the best of the best to be in and when his name appears you know that the movie is going to be good.
I:8465;2346;After telling the love of his life, I'll be right back , he boards the plane.
I:8465;2347;This movie has to be one of his best.
I:8465;2348;The teaming of Hanks and Zemeckis really packs an Oscar punch once again.
I:8465;2349;He never gives up on life and this is what hope is all about.
I:8465;2350;Tom Hanks always makes his character come to life and is a top performer in every role he plays!
I:8465;2351;Um good movie, some metaphors could be drawn from the character s experience and what not.
I:8465;2352;He played this role like he played most others.
I:8465;2353;"It is an excellent depiction of the basic human needs 
I:8465;2354;It was so wonderfull to finally see a movie with NO SEX!
I:8465;2355;I loved the fact that the director showed the basic human need for companionship though Hank's friendship with the volleyball.
I:8465;2356;The last thing I loved about the show is when Tom Hanks explained that sometimes all that you can do to keep going in life when all the chips are down is to simply keep breathing, and take one day at a time.
I:8465;2357;Dear Hollywood, keep making movies like this.
I:8465;2358;These are the ones that will make America's families strong, and individuals great, NOT WORSE!!!
I:8465;2359;this movie shows how good an actor Mr. Hanks is.
I:8465;2360;This movie is a must see.
I:8465;2361;This movie will keep your total attention.
I:8465;2362;I highly recommend seeing it today.
I:8465;2363;oscar worthy on every level.
I:8465;2364;who else but Tom Hanks can create and sustain a deep and personal relationship with a volleyball upon which he has drawn a face?
I:8465;2365;What I want to concentrate upon is Hanks' truly extraordinary acting ability.
I:8465;2366;all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.
I:8465;2367;there are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above.
I:8465;2368;"pulling scene is another
I:8465;2369;My advice: see it for yourself.
I:8465;2370;Cast Away, with Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, is a good movie.
I:8465;2371;If you like movies with action, you'll love the plane crash and when Tom Hanks tries to escape the island on the raft.
I:8465;2372;If you like suspense, you're in for it the whole movie!
I:8465;2373;If you like drama, the beginning and the end sequences you'll love.
I:8465;2374;Cast Away is a movie for everyone.
I:8465;2375;There are quite a fre documentaries/featurettes and special effects vignettes.
I:8465;2376;I have been amazed (as us all) to see the absolute incredible evolution in the career of Tom Hanks.
I:8465;2377;his movies are successful because we are comfortable with Tom in front of our eyes.
I:8465;2378;We welcome Tom into our homes and into our lives because he has gives us an enormous gift every time he does another movie.
I:8465;2379;and in Cast Away, he surpasses our already high expectations with an outstanding and demanding performance.
I:8465;2380;I have watched this movie numerous times, and each time gives me a warm and pleasant feeling.
I:8465;2381;Bravo, Tom, for making our lives richer through your superb acting and superb selection of the films you make.
I:8465;2382;Movie great and Tom is great.
I:8465;2383;tom Hanks does an excellent performance in Cast Away.
I:8465;2384;I think this is one of the best movies of the year.
I:8465;2385;There's no notable noise and colors are superb.
I:8465;2386;Personally I prefer DTS, because it's a bit more aggressive than the Dolby one.
I:8465;2387;Disc 1 also includes THX optimization program, which is good for those without any test discs.
I:8465;2388;There are plenty of extras on disc one.
I:8465;2389;"good movie thatwas constantly tugging your sleeve to nag you ""oh ."
I:8465;2390;"feel TOUCHED by this movie""."
I:8465;2391;Forrest Gump wasOK and entertaining .
I:8465;2392;hanks acting and reality of the life on a small islandis done very, very well.
I:8465;2393;I especially liked the distancesurrounding him after his return.
I:8465;2394;it is a solid, entertaining movie that respects your IQand delivers the package.
I:8465;2395;This is a undoubtably a classic of our time.
I:8465;2396;It is a nicely packaged set that really does bring more value to the collection.
I:8465;2397;It's medal on the outside, with clear plastic on the inside.
I:8465;2398;The bind itself is actually part of the plastic inside the two metal tin.
I:8465;2399;like lids that close the book up, but it is very strong and plenty sturdy enough to balance the weight of the metal lids.

I:8465;2401;disc experience, you now have a second chance to grasp onto it (and the other movies) with a more lasting alternative.
I:8465;2402;with this newly packaged beautiful set, I do hope that other movies soon will be released after these nine come out June 5th.
I:8465;2403;That's the amazing thing, this could've been made by Joe Independent if he was so inclined.

I:8465;2405;"Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office."
I:8465;2406;"So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure
I:8465;2407;There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.
I:8465;2408;a. kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it.
I:8465;2409;But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even.
I:8465;2410;I'm sure many of you saw the extended trailer at the movie theater.
I:8465;2411;It is excellently made, and makes for a wonderful evening's entertainment.
I:8465;2412;The special effects are superior and convincing, especially the crash scene.
I:8465;2413;in fact, it is fitting that this movie is so well.
I:8465;2414;It is a theme which is often delicately weaved into the plot, but at other times shoved in the audience's face with little subtlety.
I:8465;2415;Nevertheless, it provides for much drama, compelling and often genuinely moving.
I:8465;2416;now tom hanks owns me another wilson and he will certainly be welcome at your wedding.
I:8465;2417;over ViewTom Hanks (one of the best actors ever and my personal favorite) is Chuck who is a workaholic.
I:8465;2418;it is a simple story.
I:8465;2419;"It makes you envision what you would do in his place and that life is not fair but you have to ""breath everyday"" and there is a bittersweet ending."
I:8465;2420;There is a sweet message in the movie.
I:8465;2421;"chases 
I:8465;2422;Cast Away is a great movie ever!
I:8465;2423;Tom Hank did a great performec has a fedex package deliver,(Tom play has Chuck Noland).
I:8465;2424;when his pager turn off while he enjoying a Christmas dinner with kelly and relative,he have to go back to work and when he promise his girlfriend Kelly (play by Helen Hunt),said to her, I'll be right back well his plane crash at a pacific ocean and got stranded on a island.
I:8465;2425;this movie is good,has a good story and plot and directed by Robert Zemeckis,he did a great job too.
I:8465;2426;i forgot to tell you the picture,it look great too,is bright and a little dust on some scene,but it's look great.
I:8465;2427;the sound well I listen to a Dts only,the Dts sound is awesome!
I:8465;2428;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
I:8465;2429;it's so sad, but so beautiful.
I:8465;2430;those who hasn't seen it, definitely should!
I:8465;2431;It's just so sad but so good.
I:8465;2432;all the time and work put into this film, so worth it.
I:8465;2433;Okay, you know a movie is great when it has you crying over the death of a ball.
I:8465;2434;this movie was a good one!
I:8465;2435;It made me laugh, cry, scared to death, and everything else inbetween!
I:8465;2436;Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.
I:8465;2437;All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always.
I:8465;2438;what really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart.
I:8465;2439;The mental and physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!)
I:8465;2440;It speaks volumes that, within 90, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.
I:8465;2441;All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth.
I:8465;2442;forrest Gump explored a complex world where he learned that making a few significant friendships and finding a true love overcome one's ostensible intelligence or the power of money or fame.
I:8465;2443;this is a fine film, with a breathtaking performance by Hanks.
I:8465;2444;A good movie, but one that is not tolerable to view more than once or twice.
I:8465;2445;This movie looks amazing on Blu.
I:8465;2446;Cast Away is definitely one of the most memorable films of the year.
I:8465;2447;It does remarkably well with such an old concept, the stranded.
I:8465;2448;But thanks to the direction and Tom Hanks, we frequently forget it is rooted in clich .
I:8465;2449;the middle bulk of the film, I'd guess about one and a half hours long, taking place on the island, is fantastic.
I:8465;2450;This is quite an unconventional film, at least in this part of the movie.
I:8465;2451;It lets us simply watch the battle between Hanks and nature.
I:8465;2452;that's fitting the physical requirements for the role.
I:8465;2453;He has a tough job in this film, to not only act well but support the entire film with his acting alone, and he succeeds wonderfully.
I:8465;2454;as for the bookends of the film, the beginning is fairly standard, setting up the themes we know will be touched upon, but the ending is very effective, sad and realistic.
I:8465;2455;It is during this final part of the film that, as a couple of reviewers have already pointed out, we finally understand the true meaning of the title.
I:8465;2456;Two discs of features should give one plenty of extra viewing time.
