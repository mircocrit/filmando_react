1;A great family movie for teenagers
2;here are the good things about the movie:1.
3;Normally, this is how you find some great films.
4;"The fact that he used, not only J. lo and Bennifer in the same scenes (during their moments of glory together), but he also used America's favorite ""hug."
5;"able"" actor, Will Smith to play the part of Bennifer's conscious."
6;I always believe that you should try something before making your decision, but with this film .
7;Will Smith is a major one.
8;boppers in the front that just love Will Smith.
9;I hate when actors cry and there is just one tear coming from one eye.
10;Her connection with Affleck was completely Hollywood and the chemistry seemed to be concocted by leftover Meg Ryan films.
11;I enjoyed it as the first time I saw it.
12;goers alike slam an altogether terrific movie.
13;The cast and their performances are amazing, the script is wonderfully and realistically written, and it tiptoes between humor and sadness at the same time.
14;Kevin Smith did an absolutely amazing job putting this film together, a film that will make you laugh and cry.
15;a feat that oftentimes proves too difficult for movie makers to accomplish, but Kevin Smith pulls it off with charm and wit.
16;jersey Girl stars Ben Affleck as Ollie.
17;ben Affleck gives a stellar perfomance.
18;I honestly didn't know he had it in him, but I have to give him credit.
19;Liv Tyler and George Carlin also give great perfomances.
20;With this movie, Kevin Smith proves that he doesn't need Jay and Silent Bob to make a great movie, and as much I love Jay and Silent Bob, I'm glad he's finally departed with the characters and is moving on.
21;i highly recommend this film.
22;It's a great comedy, it's a great drama, it's just a great movie.
23;it's much better than Gigli.
24;phenominal movie in all the ways movies should be.
25;"with that in mind, here's my take on ""Jersey Girl"":Short and sweet."
26;that being said, the rest of the film is absolutely brilliant!
27;Kevin Smith's first step away from our beloved Jay and Silent Bob gives us all hope for his future films and projects.
28;affleck (beyond the first 20 minutes) shows the viewer one of the best performances in such a role as I've seen in over a decade.
29;Liv Tyler is absolutely enchanting, and young Raquel Castro is sure to be one of our future's best talents.
30;"so, before I drop my nonexistant street cred any lower with these overeffeminate descriptions, I'll simply leave you with these words:See ""Jersey Girl""."
31;Ignore the opening scenes, and enjoy the ingenious remainder.
32;poisoned public, make up your own mind about this one.
33;It's also got one of the last appearances by the late George Carlin, and, of course, Liv Tyler is always smashing.
34;Naturally, that means a cute kid, a grumpy dad and an understanding girlfriend.
35;I'd watch it if I were you.
36;Love Kevin Smith and love this movie!
37;Its not as terrible as Gigli because of the lovely Liv Tyler turns in a wonderful performance as Maya.
38;George Carlin is wonderful as Bart, and Raquel Castro is such a sweetheart as little Gertie.
39;The chemistry between Affleck and Tyler is wonderful.
40;I really liked this movie!
41;This movie was so cute.
42;It kept me laughing, crying and my interest (which is most important!)
43;I personally had not ever seen the other movies made by the man who made this one but I really liked this one!
44;Kevin Smith is best known for his Jay and Silent Bob series of films, which are good in their own right (personally, I think Dogma is his best work to date).
45;Jersey Girl, as a more mainstream movie for Smith, is a pleasant surprise.
46;Generally, I don't like romantic comedies, but Kevin Smith puts a unique and fun spin on the genre.
47;Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan, this movie was easy to connect with, I also have a daughter and a big ambition to make movies, it is also something that gets in the way of being a dad.
48;I absolutely loved it and looked for another showing to share it with my wife, but there were no showings available.
49;(It seems to be showing all over the place now though) I ordered it, as much to see it from the beginning as I did to share it with my wife, family, friends, and anyone else I can convince to sit through it.
50;I have a whole new respect for Kevin Smith, which means of course, that he has decided to stop making movies altogether.
51;Serves me right, if this is what he was after all along.
52;This is a great date movie!
53;My husband and I both loved it.
54;The story is very good.
55;Would definately recommend for date night
56;Although I am a single father of a boy, I felt right in tune with Affleck's character.
57;i absolutely loved this film, this has got to be one of the best he has ever done.
58;and Carlin was just hilarious in this film.
59;I finally got around to seeing this .
60;I don't know what the box office numbers were or anything, but this is a better film than a TON of stuff coming out in the same genre.
61;I think it's worth watching just for Liv Tyler, and it's always good to see Stephen Root and George Carlin.
62;The whole cast is good.
63;The interactions with the father and daughter (all ages) is funny and true.
64;friendly movie that his folks could actually go and see.
65;Has Smith strayed too far from the familiar confines of his View Askew universe?There is an audio commentary by Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck that is relaxed and conversational in tone as the two long.
66;time friends joke and laugh with each other.
67;This track is refreshingly free of the usual self.
68;This is a more production.
69;the camerawork, lighting, etc. if you didn't get enough of Smith.
70;"affleck banter on their commentary track then you're in for a real treat with the ""Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith Interview."""
71;driven material like Chasing Amy where the dialogue was realistic and heartfelt.
72;What makes this film work so well is the same reason why Clerks and Amy work and resonate.
73;to paraphrase Holden at the end of the latter film, Smith finally had something personal to say.
74;"he really is an excellent actor
75;On the bright side, I like the facial expressions and eye movements he makes"
76;in this movie, he is really very good, reacting to many things the way a real person his age would, not a strictly formulaic on.
77;the real star though, of course, is his daughter.
78;Impossibly adorable, very sharp, and, it seems, a bit manipulative, she has an amazing presence.
79;"The truly brilliant portion of it is that she actually comes off as highly intelligent and inquisitive
80;She doesn't seem to be just reciting a script, she actually gets it.
81;And that really sets her apart from kids her age.
82;george Carlin, contrary to his usual sarcastic/screw the children role, plays a loving grandfather, if a bit rough around the edges"
83;"affleck's love interest, as he so aptly puts it is ""an incredibly strange woman."""
84;carlin, is the highlight, in my opinion.
85;He has always challenged convention in his comedic routines.
86;He knows what's really important and valuable in life and when his son loses his job and comes to live with him in New Jersey, he provides a solid, stabilizing influence.
87;Carlin is the one who is the example of rock solid, family values.
88;He is the one who intruitively knows what's right and wrong in Ollie's behavior towards his daughter.
89;kudos also to Liv Taylor as Ollie's love interest.
90;This romatic comedy aspect to the movie is predictable but the performances are endearing.
91;I started the film with the feeling that I was going to see the 1000th romantic comedy of the year.
92;the film should be easily re.
93;oriented to a family comedy from a romantic comedy cutting the first 15 minutes and the mother's death, some out.
94;well, actors saved the film and at least made this a decent film to watch.
95;This was one of the best movies my wife and I have seen for awhile.
96;The casting director did an excellent job matching actors to their parts.
97;"Liv Taylor, who did a wonderful portrayal of the beautiful Arwen in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, successfully pulled of the impish Maya injected into the Trinke family."
98;But the two actors who stole the show were George Carlin in his best part ever as Bert Trinke, the down to earth Ollie's father, and Raquel Castro as Ollie's beautiful daughter.
99;I don't know if I would go quite that far, but I certainly did like this film.
100;Raquel Castro, who plays Ben Affleck's daughter in this, is outstanding.
101;Jennifer Lopez does well in a fairly brief role.
102;One supporting actor who deserves a lot of credit here, is Mike Starr.
103;On the version of this I have, there are some very good extras, as well.
104;If I hadn't known that, I might have wondered what the hell was going on, as this is actually a touching movie.
105;"laced
106;I liked the fact that Gertie, rather than perform something childlike and cute at the pageant, chooses a scene from Sweeny Todd, of all things.
107;The acting here is as top.
108;notch as the cast that delivers it"
109;Afflek's acting just wasn't his best there, but it's still a good scene.
110;so I give this movie 4/5 stars.
111;I don't think it's his best work ever, and it's dangerously close to chick flick status, but it's a really good movie that will warm your soul.
112;the supporting cast is good and the kid is cute.
113;turns out, it's actually really good.
114;infused 'indie' flick that Smith is famous for.
115;Yeah, it's a romantic comedy.
116;But it shows off a lot of wit and heart and, if men must watch romantic comedies to please their significant others, then this kind of romantic comedy will fit the bill quite well.
117;the movie is about a savvy, slick public relations guy (Affleck) whose life is derailed when his wife dies giving birth to his daughter and the strain of it all causes him to lose his job.
118;Moving in with his loving.
119;crumudgeon of a father (Carlin), he finds some joy in raising his kid, becoming a maintenance worker and flirting with the local video.
120;fare, but Smith makes it resonate with truth, and fun, and interest, and, in the end, watching this movie didn't make me think less of Smith, but more of him for such a display of versatility.
121;with the woman you love, or on your own, a very good movie to watch.
122;What a great movie with a great cast.
123;I can watch this over and over and still enjoy it.
124;I would recommend it to anyone
125;I wouldn't say it's afamily film, but it will hold your attention!The little girl in this film is really cute,and lovable.
126;ollie (Ben Affleck) is a successful publicist, and he finds true love when he falls in love with Gertrude Steiney (Jennifer Lopez).
127;ben Affleck displays the charisma and acting presence of a Ken doll.
128;"a predictable romantic comedy that isn't very funny, ""Jersey Girl"" is redeemed mainly by a few fitful comic moments, and Tyler's weirdly charming Maya."
129;I've never been a huge fan of Ben Affleck but I thought he played his role pretty well.
130;Even though there were quite a few emotional scenes, they were well enough mixed with funny scenes to balance things out.
131;Also, you'll see a few actors from other Kevin Smith movies, which was cool.
132;Although, I will say that some people may not like this because it is completely unlike any of his other movies, to my knowledge.
133;This is a cute movie, but nothing too extraordinary.
134;It's a sweet story about a single father who tries to figure out what's best for his life and his daughter.
135;It has it's funny moments, particularly with Betty Aberlin as the daughter .
136;Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were surprisingly good as well.
137;The story is good and the cast is excellent (especially George Carlin).
138;this is an all around good one, although not one for the kids.
139;give it a chance and you might be suprised.
140;I realize that some people may find this film a departure for Kevin Smith, but I still saw the same humor, the same sharp dialogue that I expect from a film by this director.
141;"I love all of Kevin's films, and I paused the movie at one point and said to my husband, ""This is a pretty fantastic comedy."""
142;Sure it has the same family.
143;fare moments we expect from Disney, but this film also has some pretty amazing performances from its actors and the story came off as very real to me.
144;The moments are real and touching and undoubtedly humorous.
145;That's why I love Kevin's films.
146;they make me laugh because they are so smart and biting.
147;I say good job, and while I'm looking forward to Passion of the Clerks, I'll be happy to see Kevin go back down this path again as well.
148;I finally got around to seeing this movie, and was totally impressed.Yes, its sweet and heartwarming (a crime in Hollywood, and an offense punishable by death for some Kevin Smith fans, evidently).
149;But its also funny and genuine.
150;Ben Affleck's performance was particularly fantastic.
151;What a great film written and directed by Mr. Kevin Smith.
152;Ben Affleck actually does a really good job in this movie about a man who has to raise his daughter alone since his wife dies giving birth.
153;It's a touching movie that is funny at parts, and even sad at others.
154;"The film also features J. lo for a few minutes at the beginning of the film
155;Most of the regular view askew actors are in this film"
156;Ben's relationship with his daughter in the film is what caries the film all the way to the end.
157;You can tell that he is a very caring and loving dad and you get the feeling that Kevin Smith wrote the movie after having experience being a dad to his own daughter.
158;This isn't like the other View Askew films, pure drama done the Kevin Smith way and it really works.
159;Probably my wife bought it and stored it away for future viewing.
160;In any case, it was an enjoyable movie well worth viewing.
161;He meets another woman and they become friends.
162;Finally, he gives up his NYC dream and makes peace with himself.
163;it's an engaging story and well done.
164;It's touching here and there.
165;The filming and sound are good.
166;Oh yeah, this flick is cute!
167;This flick has a year's worth of cute in every scene, with the cutest seven.year.
168;old girl stealing hearts and scenes, with George Carlin as everybody's ideal cute old alcoholic grandaddy, with Will Smith in a cute cameo appearance, with even the streets of Jersey showing their cute side, and overall, overarching overweening overtowering all, Ben Affleck!
169;who is so blinking cute, so blanking good.
170;looking and cute, that he can't NOT be cute, even in his moments of mean depression and/or uptown narcissism.
171;This is a film in which even the raunchy humor is cute.
172;a pretty good evening's entertainment.
173;"degree"" connections to Ben Affleck."
174;His mother, Christopher Ann (Chris) Boldt and I were good friends and classmates in college.
175;"I met young Ben once, when he was a teenager in Cambridge MS, and I saw him in ""Good Will Hunting"" without making the connection."
176;wallah which Ben Affleck film he would recommend.
177;The people who made this film are too happy to be interesting.
178;Instead JERSEY GIRL unfolds as an unabashedly sentimental family film.
179;obsessed executive in the music industry, and he is an asshat of the first order.
180;He moves back in with his blue.
181;kevin Smith, when not doling out the frat boy humor, is pretty skilled at pushing that emotional button.
182;He certainly did it in CHASING AMY and, here, he throws in the warm and the heartfelt, and yes it is just a bit mawkish.
183;But I bought into it, and I'm not even a fan of Affleck.
184;It helps that the kid is played so sweetly by Raquel Castro who makes her film debut and instantly lights up the screen.
185;kevin Smith plonks in three love stories.
186;There is Carlin and Affleck's father.
187;son relationship, and Affleck and Liv Tyler's growing romance, and Liv, by the way, is really good as the sexy but goofy video store clerk.
188;daughter relationship, and these two actors' interactions really strike a chord.
189;The acting is good, so the predictability of the story and bits of heavy.
190;I even liked Kevin's take on that patented plot device of the father trying to get to his kid's big school production in time.
191;"Lots of good lines, but my favorite is the school principal emceeing the fall pageant: ""First grader Gertrude Trinke and her grandfather will be performing what I can only assume is a hymn entitled ""God, That's Good"" from the musical Sweeney Todd."""
192;it's just a really good cast.
193;The hilarious Stephen Root manages to steal plenty of scenes, even some of the scenes featuring the very cute Raquel Castro.
194;"scenes special (00:16:20)
195;This is a good movie and it demonstrates that Smith has a range that extends beyond the four.
196;flash forward seven years and Ollie is working with his father for the public works department of the New Jersey suburb where they live while raising his beloved daughter, Gertie, played by a wildly talented child actress named Raquel Castro.
197;They work when done right, and Jersey Girl is done very right.
198;Here is where Jersey Girl works its magic.
199;Jersey Girl?s characters are refreshingly normal.
200;In short, they are a delight to watch and it is easy to care about them.
201;eyed good heartedness to Gertie's genuine childlike love for her father and her family, the characters elicit sympathy, empathy and admiration.
202;moreover, the formula works because the situations are real.
203;also, the acting in Jersey Girl is terrific.
204;As Maya, Liv Tyler has a role where her looks and charm perfectly mesh with her character.
205;Maya shocks with her forwardness but attracts with her warmth and tenderness.
206;Raquel Castro as Gertie is magnificent.
207;This young girl displays a mastery of dialogue and expression so natural that it seems effortless.
208;previously, Bounce was Affleck's best leading man romance movie.
209;He brings to the role of Ollie a genuineness and sincerity that the cynically inclined are too quick to dismiss.
210;daughter banter here, thank goodness.
211;Affleck does serious work in Jersey Girl, and if he lacks the range of some actors, he still shows a real ability to express the depths of human feeling.
212;Instead, what Jersey Girl offers is a tribute to those bonds of love and friendship that are the glue of family and the foundation of character.
213;It was the best performance i have ever seen Ben Affleck in, and the other actors did a very good job also.
214;The movie was funny and emotional at the same time.
215;Ben Affleck gives one of his best performances in this movie, I know people who can't stand him, but they like him in this movie.
216;The little girl, Raquel Castro is amazing as a singer and actress in this movie.
217;The whole cast is amazing, right down to a cameo by Will Smith as himself (in which he kind of bashes his movie I, Robot which is thought was hilarious).
218;Definitely add this to your movie list.
219;This is a good one for the whole family.
220;It was SO easy to predict.
221;Jersey Girl is a great romantic comedy starring Ben Affleck as Ollie Trinke, a successful workaholic.
222;Eventually he meets spunky video store clerk, played by the beautiful Liv Tyler (""""Lord of the Rings"""" trilogy)."""
223;"I didn't realize she could sing
224;Drew is a rich, successful advertiser who learns that love and family are more important than wealth.
225;Angelina Jolie (in one of her better roles) is a successful reporter who is faced with a career decision that will take her away from friends and family.
226;overall, the movie was great.
227;The movie had some really sad, grim moments, but it had some hilarious ones as well.
228;It is a must see for anyone who loves good romantic comedies or is a fan of one of its many star actors.
229;It has a funny scenes, and her father takes a lot of time to get his priorities straight, which he finally does by the end of the movie.
230;Kevin Smith, creator of comedy flicks like Chasing Amy, Mallrats, and Jay and Silent Bob, brings us a star.
231;laden film with sentimental cliches worthy of a Family Man sequel.
232;This film has some adult.
233;This film works well even though it seems a little unsure of its focus at times.
234;Last I checked a family film did have swearing in it all the time.
235;I would take my kids to see this movie.
236;Ben and Jen actually do have good chemistry and they both CAN act.
237;They seem destined for bliss as they go through marriage, a pregnancy and finally the birth.
238;kevin Smith has done wonders with this movie.
239;His story telling is much deeper and personal.
240;With great dialogue moments that are distinctively Kevin Smith, a good story, a cameo by Will Smith and personal touch of growth, Jersey Girl is his Smith's doorway and proof that he can do more than Lesbian/Religious/Quickie Mart/Fart and Burp movies.
241;It is the best movie and I love it!!!
242;Well worth adding to your library.
243;Have enjoyed this movie for years.
244;the Sweeny Todd performance is the greatest.
245;sure beats """"Memories"""" from Cats."""
246;One of the best things I have seen George Carlin do.
247;It is the best I have seen of J Lo (though that is not saying much).
248;But the movie overall is pretty good.
249;I found this movie to cater very much to his fans.
250;In my opinion it is an attempt for Kevin Smith to bring a heartfelt family type, quasi.
251;This isn't the best movie Kevin Smith has made, but it is very enjoyable and successfully translates Smith's style to other genres of film.
252;The movie is fun, funny, and touching.
253;Raquel Castro is absolutely enchanting, Carlin gives a wonderfully touching but hilarious performance, and Afleck can be sentimental if you give him a chance and don't prejudge.
254;This is a good flick, despite all the negative reviews this movie got.
255;Some of George Carlin's best acting is in this film.
256;"Most people will probably enjoy this flick, so long as they don't go in expecting ""Clerks 3"" or something similar."
257;You just have to love this movie, if for no other reason the touching father.
258;"Others have relayed the story, actually some panned and bashed it
259;I thought the flick was fun, enjoyable, and a love story to be remembered.
260;One of my all time favorite movies!
261;A must see and the blu.
262;I especially love George Carlin's character!
263;I loved that the little girl in the movie wanted to perform a song from """"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"""" instead of """"Cats"""" like all the other kids."""
264;Ben Affleck plays a high.
265;In a few brief scenes they are painted as the perfect, loving couple.
266;stricken to properly care for his child.
267;ridden script gives the actors no hope at all.
268;I love Kevin Smith movies.
269;I love this movie, this cast was amazing.
270;George Carlin cracked me up, Liv Tyler was wonderful and quirky, and Raquel Castro who played Ben's daughter stole the show.
271;It's a wonderful, endearing, feel.
272;makes you laugh, cry and has some shock to it.
273;Curl up alone or share it with a friend and enjoy.
274;The basic idea of this story is good: a father learning how to raise his daughter while also trying to cope with the loss of his wife and the fact that his daughter's birth caused his wife's death.
275;The dialogue was classic Kevin Smith.
276;He has a unique style, and it shines through right from the beginning.
277;Then the acting was absolutely INCREDIBLE.
278;Then top it off with a nicely picked soundtrack (maybe not QUITE a Tarantino movie soundtrack, but hey, what is?)
279;, and it just makes for a really well done, really enjoyable movie.
280;i'm a huge Ben Affleck fan and I was hoping that after Jersey Girls things might look up for his career I only was disappointed by this poor family flick.
281;The laughs stop after Ben denounces rising star Will Smith.
282;I thought this was a great movie.
283;I honestly did not expect it to be very good so I was really surprised by how much I liked it.
284;I love Ben Affleck anyway, but I thought everyone in this movie played a great part.
285;The little girl that played his daughter Gertie was so cute and such a good actress.
286;This is just a fun movie.
287;The beginning is a little sad, but the rest is upbeat.
288;This movie is sweet and funny.
289;I highly recommend this item.
290;While I don't love Ben Affleck, I loved this movie.
291;Kevin Smith is a great filmmaker because he knows what is a great idea.
292;I loved the little girl in this movie, struggling to identify who she and who her family is.
293;George Carlin is also great in a more serious role.
294;I was pleased that it got to me on time and in great condition!
295;I recommend this seller and the video.
296;The characters are likable the situations are light and entertaining.
297;This movie will provide for a few laughs, a tear or two, and will leave you with a nice feel good feeling in the end.
298;Ollie is at the top of his game and his wife, Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez), is about to have their first baby.
299;They are still living with Bart and Ollie also has a job with in the public works department of their New Jersey town.
300;"on the plus side for the final accounting of ""Jersey Girl"" is that the running joke about Will Smith has a pretty good payoff."
301;You can also throw into the mix the fine work of Affleck's supporting cast that give him ample opportunity to play off of others and seem like he is playing more than himself.
302;Now, realize that I love that musical and even staged a one.
303;"so while it is true that the cutest bits of ""Jersey Girl"" are already in the trailer you have probably scene, this is an enjoyable enough movie."
304;"After ""Dogma"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" this 2004 film certainly constitutes a change of pace for Kevin Smith."
305;What is interesting in that bit is that Affleck is more interested in explaining Smith's movies than is Smith.
306;Ollie has miraculously turned into a good and attentive father.
307;There is a musical number.
308;An incredible young actress who has Ben Affleck and her Pop, played to amazing nonchalance and toughness by GEORGE CARLIN, wrapped around her tiny talented digits.
309;George Carlin and his street plowing buddies are fun fun fun.
310;Nods to beautiful Liv Tyler for her performance as she injects an interesting sexual energy into this film.
311;But its all done so darn sweetly!!!
312;powered job and finds himself living with his crusty but lovable father, meets spirited but lovable Liv Tyler, and discovers (surprise, surprise) that love is more important than success.
313;That said, this is his best film to date.
314;"I loved ""Mallrats,"" and his dialogue in ""Dogma"" is beyond impressive
315;the story is sad, moving, and happy (though happy seems too trite of a word) and though it doesn't feel like a roller coaster, you realize you were on a sweet (or bittersweet) ride by the end of the film.
316;If Kevin Smith ever employs Ben Affleck again it will be a true testament to their friendship.
317;I hope he does, because the best performances I have even seen from Ben Affleck are when he is in Kevin Smith's movies .
318;beyond """"Chasing Amy,"""" his performance as Bartleby in """"Dogma"""" is his best IMO."""
319;"I am glad for them both
320;This is a great movie.
321;It shows that the man has a real talent for film making in other genres.
322;It's a very well done, good movie.
323;This is a great movie!
324;Jersey Girl is full of surprises.
325;The actress Raquel Castro who plays the young daughter steals quite a few of the scenes she is in with the rest of the cast.
326;She is a promising young actress.
327;The movie as a whole is a comedy.
328;But I must say it was a fun picture!
329;I gave it five stars for the great cast and the interplay that Ben has going with his young daughter.
330;There are a few surprises but I will not spill the beans, See the film and I know you will enjoy it!
331;I felt like this movie captured a wide range of emotions very well and still maintained very smooth scene transitions.
332;The story was unique, the directing was in.
333;tuned, and the acting was some of the best we've seen from Affleck, Tyler, and Carlin, but the real talent in this movie is most clearly Raquel Castro as little Gertie Trinke.
334;She gives a flawless performance and shows she is in the elite league of actresses at her young age.
335;The entire cast really melded together beautifully with each still maintaining their individually complex roles this is undoubtly due to Kevin Smith who writes and directs Jersey Girl to its full emotional potential.
336;But Ben Affleck is good in this movie.
337;okay, this is best of anything Kevin Smith has done so far.
338;And for once in his directing career, he did.
339;This is worth a watch or two.
340;I cryed and laughed through the whole movie.
341;I think this is a great movie for all.
342;Kevin Smith's style prior to this movie included well.
343;written dialogue from thoughtful characters.
344;In particular, the View Askew Universe is populated with characters who talk frankly, honestly and often hilariously about sex.
345;That style is somewhat imperfectly transferred to a movie that features as one of it's main characters a 7 year old girl.
346;ben Affleck portrays Ollie Trinke, a High.
347;rock Cafe ceremony and shows up later in the film as himself in a real """"good sport"""" kind of role.)"""
348;"The incident becomes so famous among the hacks of New York that even years afterward they call it the ""Fresh Prince Incident""."
349;Dad is played by George Carlin in one of his best film performances.
350;seven years are skipped and we again touch base with Ollie and Gertie.
351;He meets Maya, played by Liv Tyler, who works at the local video store while pursuing her degree in sociology.
352;"ollie has been TRYING to get back into the limelight, but he is a professional pariah ever since the ""Fresh Prince Incident""."
353;recommended for those who would like a kinder, gentler Kevin Smith.
354;Excellent movie with a lot of heart and humor.
355;Kevin Smith can write some incredible stories.
356;Watching Affleck go from happy, to concerned, to confused, to freaking out was really cool.
357;After it going to her being seven years old, it even got better.
358;You see he's become a pretty good loving and responsible father.
359;The movie had some very funny parts in it.
360;such as the 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' part.
361;when Ben and Kevin get in the same room together, prepare for laughter.
362;i give this move a 4/5.
363;She really enjoyed the show as well.
364;She was great in Gigli and in Maid In Manhattan.
365;once again, this is a great ViewAskew production.
366;Once again, there's also the fantastic thanks credits, which have become as great as the movies themselves.
367;The most notable of the thanks are to:God .
368;Funny, smart, and a great actor.
369;Who inspired Ben to greatness and while being great herself.
370;George Carlin is fantastic as the ratty, alcholic dad, and look out for cameos from Matt Damon, Jason Lee and most importantly, Will Smith!There are some great songs in this movie which really elevate the scene you're watching.
371;kevin Smith's movies are always great and you always remember certain points from them: whether it's thinking a certain way about religion, the art of being a lesbian, how to crash into a woman's dressing room head.
372;scenes special and cast and crew interviews.
373;She deserved to be in for longer.
374;production, and filming will start January 2005.
375;Jersey Girl is something new for writer/director/star Kevin Smith and, opening to credits, it's his first big.
376;serious flick, and it's wonderful.
377;jersey Girl stars Ben Affleck as Oliver Trinke (Trink.
378;liv Tyler makes a splendid performance as a sort of love interest for Ollie, and it's a credit to Smith that Tyler looks so good.
379;it's a breath of fresh air, and goes a long way to showing how down to earth this movie really is.
380;Look out for Will Smith in a wonderful cameo that's set up perfectly by events in the movie, and George Carlin in the most endearing role I've ever seen him in.
381;There are actually a few near.
382;played by the amazing Raquel Castro.
383;Castro is amazing in her role, and looks perfect as the offspring of Affleck and Lopez.
384;something few movies of this sort ever manage.
385;She's adorable, and she's perfect in her part.
386;I usually HATE this sort of 'chick flick' movie in general, but I was cooing out loud at the wonderfully cute moments in this flick.
387;many people will comment that the ideas in this movie are rehashed.
388;But there's something more to that.
389;This movie accomplishes that in spades.
390;Affleck demonstrates that his bad name in the press really is undeserved, and Raquel Castro is the perfect daughter to Affleck's Trinke.
391;Do yourself a favor, round up the kids/spouse/signifigant other, and enjoy this dazzling flick with a box of Kleenex handy.
392;After collecting nearly $27,000, Smith shot the film in the convenience store and premiered it at the Sundance Film Festival becoming one of the biggest highlights of the event.
393;After publicly apologizing for the film, Smith bounced back in a big way with Chasing Amy, wowing both the critics and the public alike with his perceptive dialogue.
394;Ollie Trinke is one of the biggest music publicists in New York City and everything seems to be working perfectly for him.
395;He has a well paid job, a beautiful wife, and a brand new child on the way.
396;The story for Jersey Girl, like that of Chasing Amy, is full of rich, discerning dialogue that audiences have come to love from Kevin Smith, with the vulgarity toned down a tad (note the word ?
397;Though the plot treads on the line of predictability, the conservative message it expresses and the importance it lays on the issue of family makes the whole thing worth while.
398;there are several things to expect from a Kevin Smith film, one of which includes a well.
399;Raquel Castro accentuates on screen with a wonderfully balanced chemistry with Ben Affleck and properly illustrated connection with several supporting members of the cast.
400;The main emphasis on this talented young actress has to be the look she presents on screen, which is a somewhat eerily reflection of a childlike version of Jennifer Lopez.
401;The whole piece feels so honest and realistic that audience members can truly understand the meaning that is presented in this conversational moment.
402;fanatics will come out of this ranting on how Smith has sold.
403;Granted the film is far from perfect with the cinematography being off at times, the plot trailing off every so often into the obscure realm of predictability and the musical score not working with the actions on screen, this despite the fact that several songs used worked much better.
404;In the modern world where society has been taught that the most important element in life is success and anything else prior to that must take a backseat, Smith recalls the values we once had prior to the Hilary.
405;"Family, most importantly the children, must be the most essential part of a person?s life and nothing
406;Smith also emphasizes the idea most prominent in The Great Gatsby in that although many of us would love to return to the life we had in the past, realistically we know that?s not going to happen and giving up on an unobtainable dream to focus on the present reality isn?t always the life of quiet desperation.
407;but the 3 cameos dont even help that the film doesnt work and yeah, well, all I can say for Lopez is she cant act.
408;Hopefully Affleck finds resurrection soon.
409;Second only to Chasing Amy in Kevin Smith films, this flick is great if you're looking for a cuddly romantic comedy.
410;Liv Tyler is adorable and Ben Affleck is in one of his best roles.
411;Kevin Smith is always great for including hours of additional goodies and he doesn't fail here.
412;worthy, but still worth watching.
413;Thought it was a good family movie.
414;Really a warm friendly show.
415;The story is beautiful and i was amazed.
416;I have seen others with them and have enjoyed.
417;If you are a truly open minded person who believes a person should grow and expand their horizons who is also a Kevin Smith fan, watch away.
418;this is a great film with a good if somewhat predictable story line.
419;Open your mind and your view of life.
420;Do you really expect a man as brilliant as Mr. Smith to pigeonhole himself into only one aspect of the widely varying influences he projects into his movies?
421;If your answer is yes, please find a new director to watch.
422;centeredness definitely projects onto the screen and that is the essence of Ollie Trinke.
423;raquel Castro is a brilliant young actress with a presence and personality uncommon in children.
424;if you have seen any of Smith's movies previously and liked them and you have an open mind or would like to watch a movie with true sentiment, please watch this and enjoy.
425;This is a very enjoyable, cute, and feel.
426;good movie that is entertaining.
427;This is mostly a chick flick which is worth seeing.
428;Ben Affleck stars as a successful publicist who losses his high profile job in New York when his explodes during a press conference.
429;Castro is great as Ollie's daughter.
430;Her performance is one of the best child performance I have ever seen.
431;She makes you laugh and cry with her great acting ability.
432;She is the love interest in Trinke's life.
433;The Video Store scenes and Dinner scene between Tyler and Affleck are classically funny and romantic.
434;this movie had me laughing, crying and contemplating the value of career or family.
435;for the movie to actually be worth it.
436;i found it here and i love this movie
437;Sweet, funny and worth your time, the whole family loved it, 2 thumbs up !!!!!!
438;You gotta see it !!!!
439;George Carlin (who I'm not usually a fan of) was fabulous as the gruff father/doting grandfather, and Liv Tyler was wonderful as a kind of strange but good hearted girl.
440;But it was Ben Affleck I was most surprised by.
441;Sure, he's cute and sure, he's made some decent movies, but I've never really considered him a good actor.
442;He positively glowed in this movie .
443;The film was moving .
444;the moral basic but completely true .
445;This was a moving film that deserves to be seen by everyone in America.
446;Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler deliver good performances in the movie.
447;I was a little skeptical as to whether Ben Affleck would act out his role well, but after watching the movie, I can say can act of any role and act it well!
448;Even though this was her first major role in a movie, she acted out her part really well.
449;Jason Biggs also gives a good performance, although he did not have much of a role to play in the movie.
450;The soundtrack for this movie is also good and plays some good tracks during specific scenes in the movie.
451;although it is not the most original storyline (see `I am Sam' and Sean Penn's amazing performance) and is predictable, it is nevertheless has it's moments, and is fun to sit down and spend your time with a subtle entertaining movie like `Jersey Girl' and enjoy.
452;the dialog was snappy and genuine, the acting was surprisingly understated and moving and while it was a little predictable as to where Ollie's (Affleck) journey was taking him, it was done in a way that was surprisingly funny, disarming and touching.
453;Liv Tyler is more expressive than she's ever been on film, Ben Affleck is more conflicted and more vulnerable than I've ever seen him and George Carlin gives a surprisingly nuanced performance as Ollie's imperfect, loving, alcoholic father.
454;Jennifer Lopez' small contribution to the film is fine.
455;Affleck and Lopez do a fine job convincing the audience that they were in love, so when her character leaves the film, Ollie's heartbreak feels genuine.
456;Well, in part, she gives Ollie's time in New York a fantasy.
457;jersey Girl is a modern film about modern themes in the old Frank Kapra style.
458;This is a good little film.
459;The good thing I can say about the movie is that I laughed once or twice.
460;I'm a big Ben Affleck fan so any movie he does, I love.
461;man comedy """"Jersey Girl,"""" Ben Affleck plays a Type."""
462;Yet, oddly enough, just as you're about to give up on it, the film redeems itself by sneaking in a wonderful scene .
463;right under our radar screen.
464;It's a good film by a good writer and director, Kevin Smith.
465;It's cute, funny, charming, and it has meaning.
466;Part of being a movie star is acting, but a big part is screen presence.
467;Liv Tyler is absolutely adorable in this film.
468;You can't take your eyes off her and her character is witty, sarcastic, and charming.
469;Liv Tyler is a star in my book.
470;Raquel Castro is also adorable as the main character's young daughter.
471;If you like romantic comedies, you'll like this film.
472;But I do have guilty pleasures.
473;We came to Jersey Girl, and it caught my friends eye.
474;We fell in love with it right away.
475;"Every day we find some way to fit in ""and now, Memory, from CATS!"
476;I would recommend seeing it.
477;Not the best movie in the world, but still.
478;Given the negative reviews from critics, I didn't have high expectations for this movie but it is actually a solid heart.
479;the acting is well done all around especially by Affleck, Liv Tyler and the little girl that plays his daughter Raquel(?)
480;The jokes were consistantly funny mostly because of the great acting.
481;There are some moments of seriousness but it blends seamlessly with the humour.
482;Good editing (very important IMO!)
483;and nice soundtrack also add points for this movie.
484;all in all, an enjoyable and funny movie that gave me quite a few laughs and didn't go too overboard with the sacharine.
485;family values, What is important in the world of material things and what matters most
486;But, even though the plot may be trite, the outstanding Raquel Castro, in her role of Gertie, gives a freshness to this film that makes it worth watching.
487;This little girl captivates the hearts of the viewers, and allows us to enjoy the time spent on this otherwise average comedy.
488;ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck) is a successful New York publicist working for the music industry.
489;Things are going great, the couple is in love, they keep up with their busy lives and they are fashionably late for every event they have to participate in.
490;besides Raquel Castro, I found the performances of George Carlin (I love this guy's humor) and Liv Tyler to be particularly good.
491;awesome movie, cant wait to give it as a Christmas present to my grandma, shes a huge fan and love it!
492;The little kid was a good actor and reminds me of Alyssa Milano at that age.
493;i can't honestly recommend this flick.
494;Believe me, he's an endlessly creative guy!
495;So enough on people, let's talk about the film. . . it's a love story.
496;A predictable, thoroughly enjoyable love story.
497;The plot is sweet and absolutely sincere, there is nothing contrived here.
498;Ben Affleck, who I normally do not enjoy, truly shines in the film, which allows Ben to explore emotionality never before examined in his previous characters.
499;Of course, Liv Tyler is as lovely and convincing as always.
500;Additonally, George Carlin is typically quirky, cranky and yet oddly loveable.
501;And the young girl playing Ben's child Gertie is bound to be an onscreen success story.
502;All in all the movie, is just sappy enough and speckled with just enough funny moments to keep it from going the way of the Hallmark made for TV movie.
503;I thought this was witty and very cute!
504;Bought 2, 1 for me, 1 for another George Carlin fan.
505;This is definitely a feel good movie.
506;Jersey girl is a sweet and funny movie directed by Kevin Smith (Clerks), and starring Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (both previously appeared together in Armageddon), comedian George Carlin, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.
507;despite being corny and seemingly a cliche movie, and Ben Affleck's bad acting, Jersey Girl is delightful!
508;I honestly found myself enjoying the film even though I don't usually do that with stories that offer nothing new or actors I dislike.
509;Jersey Girl is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, I am so glad to have it in my library of movies.
510;This movie was actually pretty good.
511;It wasn't Oscar or Golden Globe good but it was good enough and should have received a better box office take than it got.
512;But Miss. castro just steals your heart and it made me believe that Ben could actually be a pretty good dad.
513;I've seen Swinney Todd so I knew what the play was about and the song, so it was fun to watch them do it and the teacher not have a clue about the play.
514;This is one of my favorite movies.
515;The actors and actresses did an outstanding job.
516;I salute Kevin Smith for putting together this film.
517;It is nice to see Kevin doing Family Entertainment as well.
518;I have also seen Dogma by Kevin Smith and loved it too.
519;But that is strictly an adult comedy.
520;jersey Girl is a cross between comedy and drama.
521;I highly recommend this film to anyone!
522;The overall acting in this film is stupendous!
523;Jason Biggs did a a remarkable job acting in this film.
524;He also did a great job acting in the movie Dogma.
525;It was refreshing seeing Ben Affleck in a more serious role and Jennifer Lopez was good in her role.
526;Liv Tyler is an up and coming star and was very cute in this film.
527;i think this movie has been highly underrated and hope that everyone will take the time to see it, even once.
528;here is a BIG thanks to Kevin Smith for enlightening and entertaining the public with another great comedy!!!!
529;The scripts were fantastic, and they made me laugh and shed my tears.
530;This is one of those feel good movie, that you can watch over and over again without getting sick of it.
531;Everyone in the family loves this movie.
532;I highly recommend this movie to anyone they will love it.
533;JERSEY GIRL stars Ben Affleck, who burst into the public's awareness as a co. star with Matt Damon in GOODWILL HUNTING.
534;In brief, the plot is about a successful, highly paid publicist (Mr. Affleck) working in New York City.
535;Following this, Mr. Affleck moves in with his father in a New Jersey town, located about a 1.
536;At this outlet, Mr. Affleck meets the love interest (Liv Tyler).
537;If the viewer detects any plot elements that have appeared in earlier films, the reason is that these elements are universal, and are worthy of re.
538;The storyline does contain plot elements that are novel and clever.
539;Another clever nuance, involving irony, is Mr. Affleck's argument at a town council meeting that the city should go ahead with construction on the main street (but near the end of this film, the construction on the street backfires against Mr. Affleck, and impedes his ability to meet a pressing deadline).
540;"In New York, the young executive Oliver ""Ollie"" Trinke is a successful PR of the music industry."
541;"He promises to be the ""best father in the world"" to the young Gertie, and stays single, grieving his beloved wife, without dating any woman for seven years and trying to retrieve a position of public relation."
542;It's a feel good movie that never takes itself too seriously, but is very entertaining.
543;A very good and touching movie.
544;star cast does a great job, and you can really feel the chemistry.
545;But I enjoyed watching this sweet romantic comedy for what it is, and Kevin Smith, now himself married, also has a right to pick up father.
546;And Raquel Castro, 'Jersey Girl' of the film, is so cute.
547;Gertie loves her life in New Jersey, and so does Maya, and Ollie's father (George Carlin) too, but Ollie still wants the glorious days of NYC.
548;throating barber and delicious meat pies.
549;And at Ollie's home, the kids are showing their 'parts' to each other.
550;ben Affleck fits in the role of likeable single father quite naturally, and it is also fun to see him and his daughter exchanging humorous dialogues with each other.
551;haired Raquel Castro is incredibly cute, and the casting agent who found her deserves a special bonus.
552;'Jersey Girl' is sweet, often too sentimental, and least Kevin Smith.
553;But as unapologetically sweet romantic comedy 'Jersey Girl' is not bad.
554;Enjoy it for what it is.
555;And I thought the movie was nice actually .
556;the camera shot on her face, please!)
557;This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again and it never get old.
558;This movie is one of my favorites from way back.
559;The supporting cast, on the other hand, is pretty good, especially Liv Tyler and the little girl.
560;This is a very predicatafle movie overall, but it is very cute and delightful how it gets there.
561;I really enjoyed this movie.
562;I was expecting a romantic comedy, but this is more a movie about the relationship between a single dad and his little girl, and really hits on the comedic moments on life.
563;Being a grieving and ambitious dad, it takes a while for Ben to learn how to be a good dad, but he does almost great from there.
564;There were some things that were a bit jarring, like the swearing and talk about porn part (so maybe not ready good for very young audiences), but the witty dialogue and life decisions were really great.
565;One of the highlights of the movie is a cameo by a famous actor, well known for his cool action and drama roles, who talks about what it's like to be a dad.
566;I really enjoyed this movie as a twenty.
567;good family movie, a modern fairy.
568;Strong cast, daughter cute and lovable.
569;Yes, I love all of his films (even Mallrats).
570;First, this movie has one of the best writer/director/producer team in recent history with Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.
571;These two have pumped out several great movies and this is one of them.
572;This is a very simple premise.
573;Kevin Smith makes good movies.
574;He is creative, he writes snappy dialog, and he is funny.
575;his movies are very solid.
576;centered character Affleck is forced to become a father to young daughter, and is ultimately redeemed and made whole through the love of his daughter and in theory, the intervention of the Liv Tyler character as his new love interest.
577;Kevin Smith will continue to justify his work as a director of movies.
578;"i also recommend ""Chasing Amy"" to everyone who enjoyed this film."
