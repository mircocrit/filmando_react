1;She made two amazing films that truly showed what she could do with a few lines of dialogue and facial expressions that could a room ablaze.
2;Gilda and its equal The Lady From Shanghai show off her talent in top form!
3;In this Noir Hayworth is Gilda a smart, sexy and devlish woman who marries for money but seduces for kicks.
4;The plot is a love triangle at its best due to the fact that the main characters Haywoth, Ford and Mundson all want lust and money!
5;The films dialouge is so slick that you might want to bring some of the slang into your everyday venacular!
6;Beautiful, clear but not clear enough that the you can see clearly through it but as with ice and as with the film's heroin Gilda and its chracters have the ultimate meltdown and just our luck its for our own pleasure to watch it happen!
7;This is one of the most beautiful women.
8;I saw this movie when I was very young and adored her.
9;She was a talented actress.
10;He finds out they were lovers!
11;Macready as usual is entertaining to watch as the villian, something he was use to playing.
12;A great noir film, with lots of style!
13;In this story line she is a lady with a shady past who finds herself married on the rebound to a casino owner in South America.
14;Every move Gilda makes, every move her husband and her ex.
15;beau make only add fuel to her showcase performance.
16;But mainly she is drop.
17;dead beautiful with a devilish smile.
18;And for that you can definitely put the blame on Mame.
19;GILDA is an excellent 1946 movie from Columbia Studios.
20;Although technically a film noir, it makes its best points as an offbeat love story.
21;He also owns a switchblade.
22;Johnny does so well at this that Mundson disappears for a time and comes back with a lovely wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth).
23;They are attracted to each other, and despise each other.
24;"gILDA has some wonderful features, such as a memorable supporting cast that includes Steven Geray as ""Uncle Pio,"" a wisecracking washroom attendant with a habit of showing up at critical times."
25;GILDA is an unusual film, but a powerful, sexy and memorable one.
26;She creates an irrestistable character, and the performances the entire cast are well done.
27;I just watched this movie last night and I LOVED it!
28;I think that 'Chinatown' got a lot of it's inspiration from this movie.
29;if you liked 'Chinatown', you'll love 'Gilda'!
30;Rita Hayworth is wonderful in this movie.
31;This is probably her best film.
32;The costumes are very nice.
33;Even the guys dress cool in this film!
34;This is one of the best film noir movies ever made.
35;Rita Hayworth radiates superabundant sensuality as the magnetic center of this film.
36;"Hayworth's beauty stands outside of time
I:12721;37;There is an overwhelming ambiguous sexuality permeating the film, almost palpable, which also explains its enduring appeal.
I:12721;38;The strange nature of love and love.
I:12721;39;hate is wonderfully explored by this unusual love triangle.
I:12721;40;A very handsome and suave Argentine police official/detective (Joseph Calleia) is thrown in for good measure.
I:12721;41;This film deals with eternal truths about masculinity, femininity, and the dark, complex and unpredictable forces of sexuality.
I:12721;42;The movie was good, but way over.
I:12721;43;SHE COULDN'T ACT!The ONLY movies worth watching were the two with Fred Astaire.
I:12721;44;He could dance"
45;It seems to be a love.
46;, then gave him a job and was good to him.
47;So far, so odd, but relatively simple to understand.
48;Was it something to do with Rita's earlier line of work?
49;Well, maybe just a bit of a tease, but so lovely, sweet and tender you'd forgive her anything.
50;Glenn Ford has never impressed me as a personality.
51;Gilda has to be the best Rita Hayworth movie.
52;You'll love Put the Blame on Mame and that gorgeous costume for Amado Mio.
53;For one thing, it's one of the best LOOKING movies ever to come out of the 1940's: stunning sets, gorgeous costumes, and most of all, eye.
54;"maybe my favorite overlooked treat in ""Gilda"" is the enigmatic character of Uncle Pio, who has some of the best lines in the movie as he wittily comments on the foibles of the characters,acting as a sort of Shakespearean Fool."
55;"Screenwriting this good is certainly part of what makes ""Gilda"" so special and brings its fans back to watch again and again."
56;Rita Hayworth stars with Glenn Ford in the film noir masterpiece GILDA, which is widely considered to be the finest film in Ms Hayworth's career.
57;As a young man I want to write a few words about the film Gilda .
58;I do like old films when they are good.
59;Gilda as such did impress me less by its contents, but I was completely fascinated by the beauty and sex.
60;appeal of the ravishing beautiful Rita Hayworth.
61;One ca really feel her charisma and sensuality and it shows clearly, why men at that time were completely bewitched by her.
62;In Gilda she appears so seductive sexy , so temperamental and yet so unapproachable in her beauty.
63;This movie will hit you right in the solar plexus no matter how PC and with it you are.
64;Sex appeal and the fate of those couples meant to be exudes from every frame of it.
65;Rita Hayworth as Gilda is utterly gorgeous and desirable while Glen Ford as Johnny makes all other men pale in comparison.
66;I ate humble pie on that one.
67;velvet shots by Rudolph Mat as stunning as the scenes they reveal.
68;I especially love the song she sang Don't Put the Blame on Me Boy .
69;"to which a man sitting next to ford says one of the greatest lines ever heard in movies and probably in life "" WOMEN CAN BE EXTREMELY ANOYING """
70;infamous and seductive in its most popular days, Gilda is a film that represents some of the best and memorable scenes from the film noir genre.
71;The beauty of this film is in the silent moments.
72;What is impeccable about the film is the chemistry of the cast, and style of the film itself.
73;gilda's sultry performance of Put the Blame on Mame .
74;The movie also features an intriguing menage a trois.
75;Mundson is intrigued by Johnny's competence, his willingness to make his own luck and.
76;He offers Johnny a job in the elegant night club he owns, actually in the casino.
77;Unknown to him, Gilda and Johnny have a history.
78;Hate is a very exciting emotion.
79;But hate can be a very exciting emotion.
80;There is a heat in it, that one can feel.
81;Johnny is loyal to Mundson.
82;He also learns about Mundson's single.
83;The camera loves Hayworth, and she is photographed with exquisite care.
84;eyed and vulnerable, she's gorgeous.
85;Glenn Ford, or any other actor who would have played Johnny, has a tough job competing.
86;Ford also looks boyish, a look that stayed with him until the mid.
87;George Macready, as the third person in the menage, had probably the best role of his career.
88;He's a cool, sophisticated smoothie, a little condescending, and the real.
89;life scar he had on his cheek adds to his menace.
90;There are two other nice performances by Steven Geray as an impertinent but wise washroom attendant and by Joseph Calleia as a patient Argentinean cop.
91;"The most interesting extra is a feature on Hayworth called ""Rita Hayworth: The Columbia Lady."""
92;She comes across as a sympathetic, good.
93;natured woman with a sense of humor and little ego.
94;For one thing, Rita was a seriously talented actress.
95;For another, she was one of the best dancers in films.
96;To this day her performance in *Gilda* remains unrivaled as a combo of skill, sensuality, sensitivity, and sheer drop.
97;In return, Gilda loves to hate Johnny.
98;George MacReady offers an outstanding performance as murderous Ballin Mundson, the man Gilda fears.
99;It's a beautiful flick to look at in black and white, and it's never boring, even all the decades since it was made.
100;"I don't agree
I:12721;101;In my opinion, it's an improvement upon those classics, as fine as they are by themselves.
I:12721;102;Great films of the 1940s that had real """"noir"""" (black) denouements are *Criss Cross*, *Detour*, *Double Indemnity*, *Scarlet Street*, *The Killers* and *The Postman Always Rings Twice*."""
103;Still, on their way to a happy ending Johnny and Gilda pass through a landscape that is darker and more suggestive of spiritual abandonment than most '40s film noirs dared explore.

I:12721;114;Rita Hayworth is at her sultry best in a role that was made for her in Charles Vidor's 1946 film noir classic """"Gilda""""."""
115;Ford eventually gains his trust and is charged with running the casino.
116;Macready returns from a business trip and much to Ford's surprise reveals his new wife and party girl, Gilda.
117;the story proceeds with suspense and some torrid scenes featuring Hayworth performing provocative song and dance routines.
118;The Argentine police are aware of what is transpiring and a sympathetic detective Obregon played by Maltese born Joseph Calleia assures that the story has a satisfying ending.
119;director Vidor does a nice job in showcasing Hayworth who turned this role into a signature piece of her acting ability.
120;Ford and Macready do very well in their roles but Hayworth lights up the screen with her presence.
121;This is one of those films I never think is all that good, but I keep going back to it every four or five years.
122;competent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more.
123;He is really good as the rich husband, just fascinating to watch.
124;The dialog is what makes this story interesting for the most part, particularly in the first half of the film which is far better than the second half, and that includes the cinematography.
125;The second half is a lot more melodrama than film noir.
126;There are a couple of other factors that make this oldie still watchable and memorable.
127;Glenn Ford, early in his career, gives a magnetic performance as her frustrated lover, who finally wins her, but who had to undergo the conflicts of loyalty to his boss and overcome his dislike for the type of women he thought his inamorata represented.
128;that audiences loved to hate.
129;the mix is good, though the plot is murky.
130;Mundson invites Farrell to his posh casino and Farrell shows up and uses slight of hand to go on huge winning streak at the blackjack table.
131;the saving grace of the movie is Rita Hayworth.
132;She lights up the screen with beauty and style and can even sing and dance.
133;Her first scene in the movie is one of the best glamour shots in the history of filmmaking.
134;She radiates with charm and grace in that famous scene.
135;There is also another subplot between Mundson and a group of men with a powerful and subversive business plan.
136;There are also a handful of brief but informative bonus features.
137;This is one of the best films in Rita Hayworth's career and one of the most glamorous movies of old Hollywood.
138;Rita's sultry portrayal of the main character sets the screen on fire and you are drawn to her in every scene that she appears in.
139;After watching it, I put Gilda in my top 10 all.
140;My top 10 is a hodge.
141;the chemistry between Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth is great.
142;Glen Ford as Johnny Farrall is at his most handsome and his performance is equally as good as Rita's although after the first shot of Gilda flipping her hair back at her vanity all eyes remain on her.
143;this movie is pure film noir gold a must have for any movie buff.
144;I'm sure MM studied this film.
145;ford is your confident, two.
146;And while he's fast and street wise about most things, he's like a little boy with women.
147;care air of a man who has fought and won many duels.
148;I recall he always played villains and made us believe.
149;"i liked the resolution which showed that Gilda was more a tease than anything else and kind of sweet even though she said, ""If I had been a ranch, they'd have named me the Bar."
150;It was great to see Glenn and Rita.
151;I got the Movie because I wanted to sing Rita sing Amoda Mio.
152;I love the Pink Martini version of the song and they used footage from Gilda in the music video.
153;love relationship story is a terrific drama.
154;I spent two weeks with them and their son Peter Ford on a wonderful ocean voyage .
155;Ford made a lot of good movies and this is no exception.
156;George Macready is an excellent heavy and the little philosopher at the club sidelined a mildly philosophical view of the intrigue and romance.
157;This cleverly plotted, morally ambiguous tale of intrigue and m nage.
158;Mundson tells him about an illegal high.
159;One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth).
160;hate dynamic continues, in turn eventually leaving Mundson dead.
161;Farrell and Gilda finally reconcile and confess their mutual love, and apologize for the many emotional wounds they have inflicted on one another.
162;"when first released, the staff at Variety magazine liked the film and wrote, ""Hayworth is photographed most beguilingly."
163;vis, in his first picture part in several years.
164;known performance, Gilda, released just after the end of WWII, draws much of its peculiar power from its mixture of genres and the way its characters interact with each other.
165;Imbued with a modern perspective, the film is quite remarkable in the way it deals with sexual issues.
166;Rita Hayworth, aside from her stunning looks, is also a truly great actress and dancer!
167;I enjoyed watching the the reap what you sew principal.
168;It a movie you can share with your mate.
169;quite enough to spark post conversation.
170;"Over the weekend, my interest in yet, another, classic film star sparked when I watched ""Cover Girl"" with Rita Hayworth."
171;IT's film noir, it's dramatic, it's a 1940's film starring one of the best actresses to come from that time, Rita Hayworth.
172;"She stars, sings, dances, shimmies, and shakes like the earthquake she sings of in ""Put the Blame on Mame."""
173;Rita was the ultimate package for Hollywood.
174;A Truly talented Redheaded dynamo.
175;lover, played by Glenn Ford, comes back into the picture as her husbands' helping hands and eventually he is trying to use his own hands to help himself to Gilda.
176;Gilda is red hot and rearing to go with the first guy who will have her.
177;She yearns for attention, and thrives on the reaction she gets as well.
178;not the best well known of it's kind, this film noir is a fine film which turns out to be quite a great work thanks to the shining star called Rita Hayworth.
179;Finally I got the chance to watch the entire movie, which was quite an experience !
180;Rita was great, without her the movie wouldn't stand out.
181;Her performance was superb, shadowing the rest of the crew, that ,frankly, wasn't that great.
182;She is the movie, put any other actor beside her and the movie would still be great, omit her and it's just anither movie.
183;She was really amazing ,talented actress.
184;Gilda may be the best classic film noir ever for a number of reasons, I mean the best of the black and white classics of the 40's and 50's.
185;The many reviewers on this site have done a good job describing the plot, the passion, and Rita's unequal performance.
186;But Gilda is much more than that.
187;It is the incarnation of the 40's film atmosphere of elegance and romance.
188;And in the middle of it comes Gilda, a movie that nobody would dare remake and stay alive, that gave us the once in a lifetime gift of the love Godess.
189;This is one of the greatest films noir of all time.
190;There's some mystery, but really, it's all about the characterizations.
191;Hayworth is at her best and absolutely beautiful.
192;This fast pace romantic drama keeps us guessing and the surprise ending is a 1940's Hollywood gem.
193;extra Features: featurette, Rita Hayworth .
194;The Columbia Lady (some very enjoyable dance sequences with Fred Astaire), Vintage Advertising, Talent Files and Trailers.
195;This is a great movie to enjoy over and over.
196;I am in my 50's and was born and raised in the '50s.
197;"In David Lynch's enigmatic and erotic masterpiece ""Mulholland Drive"", a beautiful brunette amnesiac sees a movie poster of ""Gilda"", starring Rita Hayworth, on a bathroom wall and spontaneously takes the name ""Rita"" for herself."
198;see this movie and you'll find out what your grandfather, your father, David Lynch, and I found out!
199;Gilda has the defining elements of film noir.
200;see the first shot w/camera rising from BELOW ground to the gritty street bar scene.
201;Great B and W .
202;The movie writers have clever fun with the actors, who clearly enjoyed themselvers and each other.
203;Recall, Ford played babyfaced nice guys until this one.
204;Some things are dated but funny in a way.
205;gotta love it in the context of history.
206;For pure fun and a sly depth I think Gilda is arguably the best and most entertaining to own and keep.
207;rita Hayworth is absolutely stunning in the role as Gilda, and the chemistry and tension between her andJohnny Farrell (Ford) is incredible.
208;This is what sexy was before women lost all their clothes.
209;She dances in this dress that has a slit up one leg and it is so amazing.
210;Her first scene in the movie is the best, and most memorable.
211;I'm a Rita fan, and I love this movie, its interesting and I enjoyed watching it.
212;Its a must have classic!
213;the presence of the alluring and seductive Gilda (Rita Hayworth)not only will ignite the screen, but will constitute a true turning.
214;on the other hand will make the best she can and through her erotic artifices and suggesting voice will intend to take revenge and make suffer both men.
215;as you see this is an intriguing puzzle that combines cleverly betray, greed, wounded self stem, jealous feelings, and hidden emotions.
216;Nothing is innocent and no happiness is free.
217;a true masterpiece that has overcome its own times to become not only a status cult movie but a sublime and well positioned classic, maintaining its actuality and freshness despite having elapsed sixty years.
218;all the cast was splendid.
219;Masterful direction of Charles Vidor.
220;This is my favorite noir film of the 1940s.
221;Rita Hayworth is stunning of course, the timing is great, Glenn Ford is awesome, everyone should see this at least once.
222;This film is a prime example of how a superb cast of actors can save a mediocre screenplay.
223;"The highlight of the film is Rita Hayworth singing "" Put The Blame on Mame "", This film is one of the best of the Film Noir films of the 40's and it was without a doubt the performance of Rita Hayworth's career."
224;Her performance as Gilda has got to be one of the sexiest performances I have ever seen.
225;Her beauty and appeal are perfectly showcased in her striptease to Put The Blame on Mame .
226;It's classic, classic I tell you!And even more importantly, the love triangle is so tightly constructed, you'll find yourself struggling for Gilda's decision even more than Glenn Ford.
227;In fact, Hayworth's first appearance in the film is one of the most famous in Hollywood history, and in just one shot, you can tell exactly who and what she was to Ford.
228;especially if u heard Bacall in To Have and Have Not and the Big Sleep and liked it) you will LOVE Gilda's rendition of Put The Blame On Mame.
229;Every film historian around knows that song, and through the slinky performance, we know that Ford is a fly caught in Gilda's sticky web.
230;i highly recommend this to everyone!!
231;This is practically film noir at its greatest!!
232;the top and/or bottom of the image has been removed so it fits on widescreen tvs, phones, etc. this is a classic film that desirves to be seen in its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1.
233;Even those who don't love classic films have seen the famous shot of Rita Hayworth's first moment on camera in this movie .
234;when she flips her head up and bounces that amazing head of hair all around her shoulders and smiles.
235;Rita Hayworth is glamorous, gorgeous, captivating and tragic as one.
236;Though Rita Hayworth's sultry performance steals each scene in which she's featured, it is overall an excellent movie.
237;Combine her potency with a plot involving an illegal gambling operation with plenty of shady characters ~ in fact, every character has an ulterior motive and a secret ~ and you have a film that, after 60 years, is still fascinating to watch.
238;great tight tense script, direction and cast makes an all.
239;Excellent film noir, quite enjoyed.
240;All who I've shared with enjoyed.
241;A chill kind of film.
242;old mom loved it as washer Christmas gift.
243;It just was so sexy it seemed like more.
244;An in your face performance by an absolutely gorgeous Rita Hayworth.
245;She took my breath away for a moment when she first appeared.
246;No doubt in my mind this is her best performance.
247;She is so hot in her scenes with Johnny played by Glenn Ford.
248;He is at his best also.
249;She is wild and slutty but it is just to get Johnny jealous.
250;But they love each other so much they can't survive without the other.
251;It is a fine, almost great, top shelf star power movie.
252;One of my favorite movies of all time.
253;Great movie with the famous scene of the hair flip that we all love, a must have for all silver screen fans.
254;Seen this lots of times .
255;favorite scene Guilda doing Put The Blame On Mame .
256;There will never be a more beautiful woman making a song sexier.
257;this world will never behold a more gorgeous creature.
258;She's absolutely gorgeous, breathtakingly beautiful, and she can act.
259;it has a superb cast and directed by Charles Vidor.
260;It's a wonderful Film Noir!
261;However, Rita Hayworth's energy,beauty, and raw sexuality makes this movie a true classic.
262;Glen Ford does a great job, along with a full cast who delivers a fine performance.
263;I love watching these movies with my mom, the oldies we share of love for them.
264;Covergirl is another wonderful movie.
265;These movies are so nostalgic.
266;she is a goddess, her mannerisms her style her beauty and her acting .
267;this movie is really great and will be just the thing for those who are into film noir b/w classic type movies like notorious, casablanca etc.
268;Great plot and wonderfully executed performances by the entire cast .
269;but have to say that she outshines everyone and is just breathtakingly beautiful .
270;her character is portrayed to perfection .
271;the pain she feels is so rivetingly reflected in her eyes each time the camera turns to her face and her outward playful expression transforms into a melancholy longing for love betrayed by her eyes.
272;It is one of the my favorite pictures.
273;So I have given many times to my friends.
274;It was a pleasure found in your store.
275;Gilda is one of those movies which really helped define the film noir cycle of the 1940's.1950's.
276;"Rita Hayworth is powerful as the femme fatale who is ruthless
I:12721;277;Themes to watch for: the male figure is strong in regard to just about everything except when it comes to interacting with Gilda.
I:12721;278;She sets it on fire.
I:12721;279;Married to a sinister Buenos Aries casino owner old enough to be her father, she's a wild kept toy.
I:12721;280;Gilda is a classic and should not be missed by 40's film lovers.
I:12721;281;This is film noir at it's best!
I:12721;282;This film is mystifying and intriguing!
I:12721;283;Though not a fan of how men in movies in the time period were often shown slapping women, Rita Hayworth is very beautiful in this movie.
I:12721;284;The movie is clear, no glitches and a good addition to my collection of old classics.
I:12721;285;Moody, playful and captivating throughout, Gilda shines especially bright when Rita Hayworth is onscreen.
I:12721;286;Her confidence, beauty and brazenness literally took my breath away in scenes.
I:12721;287;This movie deserves five stars for her introduction scene alone.
I:12721;288;I highly recommend this film to fans of film noir and shockingly bold beauties.
I:12721;289;But A Excellent Movie All Around Too.
I:12721;290;The two men become perfect partners in business and close friends.
I:12721;291;One day, Mundson returns from vacation with a new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth), an attractive, headstrong young woman whom Johnny has met before.
I:12721;292;thanks to her smashing rendition of Put the Blame on Mame , Gilda is Rita Hayworth's best.
I:12721;293;It's certainly a sexy, energetic, eye.
I:12721;294;Gilda owes most of its success to Rita Hayworth's charisma.
I:12721;295;The film features the most hateful romance I've ever seen.
I:12721;296;Gilda has great style, though, and seductive noir.
I:12721;297;So it's entertaining, even if the story is off the wall.
I:12721;298;Dubbing is available in French, Spanish, and Portuguese.
I:12721;299;glen Ford, as Johnny, plays a complex bundle of inconsistencies in regards to Gilda and makes it believable.
I:12721;300;There's an underlying theme of self.
I:12721;301;this is a must see movie for everybody interested in watching intelligent executed, well written and well played movies.
I:12721;302;The movie surprises with many unexpected twist and turns and a multi faceted characters.
I:12721;303;Hayworth isperfect and she strolls through this moviewith the confidence and sex appeal of asuper model down a runway.
I:12721;304;the plot is no disappointment, either.
I:12721;305;From there, more clever twistsand turns finally result in Gilda and Johnny finally recognizingtheir true love for each other.
I:12721;306;It's guaranteed enjoymentfor any fan of Hollywood's silver screen era.
I:12721;307;A movie with a realistic plot.
I:12721;308;Rita Hayworth and her co star had a great chemistry.

I:12721;312;this movie is sexy and fun and has one of the most beauitful women ever to grace the sliver screen Rita hayworth with that Red hair and swinging hips that tight black silk dress and long black gloves moving as she sings put the blame on mame.
I:12721;313;Really enjoy the excellent acting in this film.
I:12721;314;Although Rita Hayworth receives top billing for her untamed sultry role as Gilda, Glenn Ford deserves high praise for his depiction of """"a man who makes his own luck"""" in a post."""
315;woman (the gorgeous Rita Hayworth) traps the man with her seductive powers, often getting him to kill for her before she herself is killed/punished for her crimes of transgressing in a man's world.
316;i admit that I laughed through much of the film as the heterosexual, homosexual, AND bisexual playfulness of the dialogue is simply a joy to listen to, mostly due to Hayworth's goddess.
317;She's in love with a penniless bum, Johnny (Glen Ford)who just happens to fall into a tub of butter after a big time casino thug (Joel McCready)who also happens to be Gilda's new husband, elevates Johnny to the level of fellow racketeer.
318;One thing about the film remains electric, Rita Hayworth!
319;"Her striptease and song ""Put The Blame on Mame"" is one of a handful of the cinema's guilty pleasures."
320;Although most of the film exhibits a fairly good transfer, there are moments when the film element is down right grainy.
321;No aliaising or shimmering of fine details, thank heaven!
322;The audio is nicely restored.
323;the rich black and white cinematography, wonderfully constructed sets, and Rita's dance numbers, as if that's not enough to take one's breath away.
324;The strong, sensual heat generated between Hayworth and Ford is guaranteed to make you very hot beneath your collar.
325;The priceless expression on Johnny's face when he discovers that Mundson's bride and his ex.
326;When Johnny has the opportunity to punish her for what he believes to be her sinful behavior, the sparks between them go up another notch.
327;Those slaps that they inflict on each other (love hurts!)
328;that one will linger in your head for a long, long time.
329;"With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), ""Gilda"" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history."
330;There's just not enough of their powerful chemistry to go around!!!
331;A winner, with great performances by the whole cast.
332;Yeah!Thanks much for the terrific service.
333;Gilda has a darker plot and the characters are not as noble, but story, cast, costumes, and music combine to create screen magic.
334;"Think of ""Gilda"" as a riveting Anti."
335;One thing leads to another and eventually Johnny becomes Mundson's devoted right hand man and the manager of his very lucrative casino business.
336;Mundson introduces Johnny and Gilda, hoping these two important people in his life will like each other.
337;The black and white video has been cleaned up beautifully.
338;There are still some white spots that flash from time to time but overall this version looks very good.
339;The sound track is clear with no dead spots or unexpected drops in volume.
340;The most prominent bonus is a featurette about the career of Rita Hayworth at Colombia Studios.
341;this is a classic film noir where everything works.
342;"Even if you do not watch any of the rest of this movie, the Rita Hayworth singing ""Put the Blame on Mame, Boys"" scene is worth five or more stars."
343;She is absolutely beautiful, perfect in sensuality.
344;Her gown is a dream.
345;Her flawless skin, white teeth, and cascading volumes of hair.
346;Gilda is a perfect name for her.
347;I do remember Glen Ford being very dark and charismatic in the film also and the tension heightened by their love/hate relationship.
348;great acting, great plot and the most sensual strip tease in a movie ever, even though Gilda just takes her glove off.
349;rita Heyworth's best perfomance ever and she was never able o top it.
350;time classic is loaded with fierce passion and sheer beauty.
351;About passion, after seeing it you'll give some thought to one of the key phrases uttered in it: Hate is a very exciting emotion.
352;well, sorry, you have to see the movie.
353;Besides the photography being so incredibly beautiful, Rita is.
354;Only her beauty can describe her beauty.
355;I had the opinion that the most gorgeous close.
356;What a great classic movie from the vaults.
357;This truly is a favorite of Rita's work.
358;Great stage sets, clothing and story line.
359;This film is rightly celebrated as Rita Hayworth's greatest film.
360;Certainly, it contains her most famous visual moment, and what is probably one of the most famous images in the history of film.
361;George Maccready is escorting his right hand man Glenn Ford up the staircase of his mansion, telling him about his new bride.
362;"As they reach the top of the stairs, he calls out to his wife, ""Gilda, are you decent?"""
363;The camera jumps into the dressing room, to a tight close up of a woman with her hair thrown forward so she can brush it out.
364;"Gilda dips her head, throws back her hair, reveals her beautiful face, and almost mockingly replies, ""Who, me?"""
365;She has married Maccready because she learned that his right hand man was in fact her former lover.
366;there are so many stunning moments in the film.
367;And thanks to Hayworth, Ford, and Maccready, that love triangle is, at every point, a thing of extreme fascination.
368;Special mention should also be made of the excellent supporting role played by the Joseph Calleia, as the police detective.
369;the great irony of the film is that while it was Hayworth's greatest triumph, it was also the last truly great film in her career.
370;Rita Hayworth was a screen heroine of breathtaking beauty and vibrating sensation who lived a luxurious world in which her own expensive form of life was backgrounded by exotic tropical surroundings and international intrigue.
371;"of which ""Gilda"" is perhaps the most famous."
372;performed dynamic moves while trying to look, and feel, too sexy.
373;rita captured everything about Gilda's character.
374;there is a heat that one can feel and its intensity is pretty high.
375;the movie shifts into a tremendous struggle between temptation and loyalty, jealousy and envy, suspicion and mistrust, love and desire.
376;Gilda reunited Rita with Glenn Ford in a magical moment which had everyone wonder that haunting harmony that reflects their forbidden passion.
377;Their chemistry was real enough, making this sensational melodrama a box.
378;But there are some moments in film that make a movie worth a million bucks for that shining few seconds.
379;Its an image that has rocked the world for almost sixty years.
380;And somewhere out there are still many weary old men who still feel a faint stirring when they think about that satin doll.
381;I suspect it will be that way for generations to come.
382;I've seen some sexy performances in my day from older actresses (Liz Taylor in 'Cat on a hot tin roof', Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' to name a couple).
383;But MAN 'O MAN was Rita Hayworth gorgeous in this movie.
384;"She showed a lot of emotions and range in her role, and throughout the movie I kept thinking to myself ""I don't know what she did to tick."
385;Easily THEE sexiest role I have ever seen, regardless of day and age.
386;Gilda is a classic 40's love story in black and white and Argentina.
387;Gee, Johnny, is she in danger or something?
388;A fascinating film with some brilliant one.
389;Of course, love and hate are opposite sides of the same coin and this is especially true of Gilda and Frank.
390;'on the rebound', as she puts it.
391;has married Munson [Macready], a highly complex man.
392;He is cold, greedy and deadly but, at the same time, he has a thread of real humanity and loves his faithless wife.
393;This is by far one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen.
394;Rita Hayworth is delightful as Gilda.
395;It is a great movie for any collector of classic movies.
396;The always stunning Rita Hayworth stars as Gilda, the ultimate femme fatale in this film noir classic.
397;She's a woman who uses her womanly charms in a manly way: to manipulate and gain power, creating drama for everyone, including herself.
398;well, you'll have to watch and find out.
399;The first hour&40 make this DEFINITELY worth watching.
400;time movies and Rita Hayworth is one of the all.
401;In the days before home videos, film buffs waited years at a time for Gilda to finally show up in the middle of the night on TV.
402;Everyone knows these two SHOULD be together, WANT to be together, HAVE to be together.
403;Lots and lots of lust, but a weird love.
404;Heyworth and costar Glen Ford do a marvelous job looking extremely hot and bothered up on the screen.
405;I just love these old movies.
406;I recently saw this on TCM and thoroughly enjoyed it.
407;A must see movie time and time again.
408;however, Rita Hayworth is just wonderful.
409;One of the most beautiful women that ever walked theearth.
410;Then Johnny's boss comes back from a trip with a new wife, Gilda,played incandescently by Rita Hayworth.
411;this odd little story is highly likeable for about three quarters of the film, when it makes a strange detour.
412;Fortunately for us, the story gets right back on track at the end.
413;ford does a good job as the loyal and jealous Johnny.
414;He is vibrant, athletic and serious.
415;Hayworth's beauty glows and gleams.
416;She is given quite a few song and dance numbers.
417;The filming is gorgeously contrasted black and white with the requisite shadowy interiors.
418;A great movie showing Rita at her best.
419;"Fans of ""Gilda"" will champion the presence of Rita Hayworth in this highly entertaining film, but Glenn Ford delivers the more important performance."
420;Hayworth, who is lovely, if a bit elbows and feet, naturally gets our attention.
421;I wouldn't have even thought of him in the role, yet Ford is so good you're tempted to think that he was an inspiration for Ian Fleming's literary James Bond.
422;Hayworth is the titular character, a take.
423;prisoners vamp who uses words like weapons and likes to clean her teeth with the bones of the men she's devoured.
424;She marries a shady type .
425;"upping between Gilda and Johnny that, as Munson puts it, revels in its savagery because ""hate can be a very exciting emotion."""
426;"pressed to think of a film I've seen in the last five years whose dialogue is as effortlessly sexy as the writing in ""Gilda""
I:12721;427;The authentic fireworks are between Hayworth and Ford, and they deliver, lashing out at each other in ways that only two people who really love each other can.
I:12721;428;In fact, this is probably the best romance I've seen this year, a feat made all the more remarkable since there's less to like about Gilda and Johnny than there is to dislike.
I:12721;429;The film is directed capably by Charles Vidor, and the score includes the delightful """"Put the Blame on Mame,"""" sung several times, including during what is probably the least revealing but best striptease I've ever seen."""
430;Gilda is one of those classic films that grows on you, and though I've never run out to watch a Glenn Ford or Rita Hawyworth movie, I might just now.
431;Johnny is a small time, but talented, hustler who finds himself at the wrong end of a gun on the dark back streets of Buenos Aires.
432;"Johnny and Ballin form a close partnership with Johnny being the ""man who runs the joint"" and Ballin the Master."
433;"All the accolades that have been showered on her sexy ""striptease"" interpretation of ""Put the Blame on Mame"" are true!"
434;"And still this film has much more to offer
I:12721;435;This artificial melodrama is only redeemed by the absorbing performances of its lead actors.
I:12721;436;man of a powerful casino owner.
I:12721;437;The dialogue sparkles once managed by these actors and in this style.
I:12721;438;Hayworth is captivating as Gilda, perhaps her most accomplished performance.
I:12721;439;Ford is also good as the gambler promoted by the boss to casino top.
I:12721;440;The character actors, particularly Joseph Calleia and Stevan Geray, provide excellent support.
I:12721;441;Johnnie becomes Ballin's right hand man, managing his casino and running his errands.
I:12721;442;One night, one of his errands becomes babysitting the Lovely Rita, I mean, Gilda.
I:12721;443;I was completely surprised by it.
I:12721;444;'Johnny' Farrell is a small.
I:12721;445;One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics.
I:12721;446;Its Rita at her best and one of her many roles where she played opposite Glenn Ford.
I:12721;447;Its a movie that is just fun to watch , even if the story is slightly confusing at first.
I:12721;448;It really is a classic.
I:12721;449;She is indeed the """" Love Goddess """" Rita Hayworth maintained her allure and sensual personality down the years since she made this movie."""
450;"A classic in the mould of "" Casablanca ""."
451;This however is more sensual, inviting and alluring without physically showing anything.
452;A woman who is naturally gifted and made full use of that talent.
453;Feline movement is just wonderful to see.
454;Original story exceptionally acted by everyone.
455;I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see some out of the ordinary.
456;Gilda is the most misogynistic Hollywood film you'll ever see.
457;This is surprising in a script that's notable for its brilliant, multi.
