1;"Spiderman 2 makes ""Spiderman"" seem like a warm."
2;The melodrama envelops our attention, and the action scenes are marvelous.
3;Ironically, this friend has connections with a scientist who can be the key to Peter's success.
4;Spiderman 2 is a substantial movie because, unlike similar superhero movies, we remain interested and are often at the edge of our seats.
5;Frequently many hero figures vanquish their opponents too early or too often, but Spiderman has many problems and an incredible adversary.
6;In the story, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane is likable, and Dr. Oct. is certainly menacing enough.
7;The supporting roles are effective, too.
8;The portrayal of Peter's Aunt is endearing, and his newspaper editor boss provides an entertaining caricature.
9;His relationship with his friend provides good connections and variety to the plot.
10;"Screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who won an Oscar for ""Ordinary People"") gives the screenplay the right touches, and director Sam Raimi is an expert for leading us along this great adventure."
11;Spiderman 2 has the look and feel of a flawless comic book hero classic.
12;I actually enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater.
13;I'm sure the producers are laughing all the way to the bank.
14;This extended was actually pretty good.
15;Give us a freakin break.
16;not only is it entertaining , but it adds , just like the first SPIDERMAN film , the human element , which might seem strange for a film not based on reality .
17;I am always excited about sequels to movies I love, but deep down I never really expect them to top the original.
18;this is one of the exceptions.
19;Everyone involved gives this movie their all.
20;The acting is terrific, the direction is excellent, and the script manages to up the ante when it comes to both action and emotion (something missing in many action movies).
21;this is a terrific movie.
22;The best scene is probably the first fight between Doc Ock and Spider.
23;It takes place in a bank and on the side of a skyscraper.
24;It is very intense and exciting.
25;The ending is also better than the original's.
26;It leaves you satisfied and eager to see what happens next.
27;In the meantime, I highly recommend going to see this movie.
28;But I will honestly say out of the countless superhero films I have seen: this is, without a doubt, the best.
29;Simply put, it takes its time.
30;It pauses for a breath and dwells on the human side of Spider Man.
31;He is after all, Peter Parker beneath the mask.
32;He is a human being full of emotional weakness' with physical and spiritual longings.
33;the villain this time around is a caring professor that loves what he does and has a tender heart for education and furthering the betterment of man.
34;Like the saga or not, you could see the fun they were having all the way through.
35;Now it seems, he has developed the same sincerity towards Spiderman.
36;spiderman 2 rests on common ground, then stands tall, rising uniquely over the rest.
37;Add this to your collection, it has my seal.
38;man movie rocked the comic book movie universe, and fufilled a promise hollywood made to me when i was about 8.
39;The story telling is fantastic.
40;It the right balence of action, and drama!
41;The fact that Peter Parker is just a normal kid who was give extraordinary powers.
42;His reactions and discions are extreamly human.
43;man 2 did me, and every fan justice and made us feel it was worth waiting all those years.
44;and the bonus features are great!
45;Bought As Gift Person Absolutley Loved It.
46;i viewed this movie about as much as I saw the first I think.
47;mary Jane is his love interest again, and she's married.
48;They love each other and unlike one, he actually makes time for her this time.
49;the action was great and the villain was a methodical genius.
50;end note: final score is still up in the air.
51;"man 2"" is everything a sequel of it's caliber should add up too: better special effects, breath."
52;taking action sequences and a deeper story.
53;"man 2"" succeeds at respecting and building off of the story established in the first movie."
54;man, keep him from holding a steady job, making ends meet, keeping in touch with family and friends, and most importantly: being with the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson.
55;The stakes in this movie are raised really high and the result is a more powerful and gripping film than the first one.
56;"man 2"" is better than the original, which is quite an accomplishment considering the standards it set."
57;Sam Raimi's vision and passion for the material oozes through with each scene.
58;Raimi is easily the most underrated director of the moment.
59;Tobey Maguire shines through in this one, with an improved performance (looking and acting less and less like Keanu Reeves kid.
60;brother) and Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as always.
61;"man 2"" is intelligent and fun at the same time."
62;Everyone who has interest in it will walk away happy, fully satisfied .
63;i wouldn't have thought it possible, but the best superhero movie just got even better, with 8 minutes of restored footage.
64;But most of the additions are subtle.
65;I won't spoil it, but it's a real treat for fans of J. Jonah Jameson.
66;defined and purely entertaining comic book films ever.
67;Here is my contribution to the 5 stars this movie deserves.
68;man is made even greater by the second one, and viceversa.
69;I really hope I'm making some sense.
70;Definitely worth every cent the price of admission, and all you pay inside the movie theater for popcorn and soft drinks!
71;Serious Spidey fans know what role he plays in the series!
72;This would add a great twist to the plot in the next movie!
73;I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year.
74;While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X. men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history.
75;"I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best ""character study"" films of the year."
76;Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up.
77;He uses the technique of huge.
78;He never really feels strong.
79;All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters.
80;it took everything from the first blockbuster and made it 10x better.
81;The special effects are worth a viewing.
82;and really show how far we have come along in the art of cinema.
83;The dialog is as great as the action.
84;The story line is engrossing and every end is tied in this installment.
85;these actors really bring the comic book characters to life and I feel as if this movie as stayed as true as possible to the comic book story.
86;But i find the humor in the movie to be just as enjoyable as anything else.
87;This movie has it all but above all else it is just really entertaining.
88;if you like good story lines, comic books, special effects, love stories, action, and comedy.
89;then you will find something to like in spiderman 2 along with the original.
90;I highly reccomend these movies to anyone who wants two hours of face paced fun.
91;this movie was excellent by itself, hands down the best superhero movie in a long time (if not best ever), and was better than the first for a few reasons.
92;man was always my favorite super hero growing up.
93;But this awesome sequel blew the first one out of the water, and I loved the first one.
94;There is just as much action, with more story revolving around Peter Parker as a person, a person with real feelings and real problems.
95;This movie honestly is my favorite of the year, and one of my favorites ever.
96;man 2 is one of the best films released so far this year, as well as one of the best superhero films ever released.
97;The movie is packed with action, humor and emotion.
98;It is a love story disguised as a comic book movie and it works great.
99;Unlike most films of its ilk, it knows how to balance the action and the emotion, with well placed moments of humor, to make a film that is more complete than any popcorn film has ever been or deserves to be.
100;Tobey Maguire fully embodies the angst.
101;ridden hero and is the perfect Peter Parker/Spider.
102;man, Kirsten Dunst is great as the object of parker's affection, and James Franco expands onhis role very well.
103;Alfred Molina is perfect as Doc Ock, letting his subtle emotions and occasional quips do the talking, instead of being hammy and bloating the film.
104;Sam Raimi has made an excellent sequel that outdoes its predecessor in every way.
105;This is the movie of the summer!
106;"man"", the creative team was free to explore new elements of the abundant universe of the comic."
107;In few words the story is better because they used more elements this time.
108;Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a more developed character this time, she is Spidey's love interest, but she now wants to move on with or without Peter.
109;"man 2"", her dialogues are richer and her performance is tender and sweet, just like Aunt May in the comics."
110;this time Harry Osborn (James Franco) is more important than just a good friend, Harry presents another dilemma to Spidey.
111;"And the villain is a big improvement over the ""Green Goblin"", Willem Dafoe was great in the first movie, but Alfred Molina as ""Doctor Octopus"" is one of the best villains in a comic."
112;"man 2"" covers much more ground than the first movie."
113;the special effects are very improved, still there are some effects that look like a videogame, but overall the visual and sound effects are convincing and help to built the action.
114;By the way, this movie has the most incredible action sequences seen so far in a comic.
115;based movie, the action is bigger and better.
116;"the music is more dynamic in ""Spider."
117;"man 2"", Danny Elfman used some of the old tracks, and added new ones."
118;"The cast and the director seem more comfortable in ""Spider."
119;Tobey Maguire is as reliable as always, Alfred Molina is outstanding as Doc Ock and the rest of the cast is very solid.
120;"man 2"" has a little bit of everything: it has action, drama, romance, comedy, good performances, great direction by Sam Raimi, outstanding visual and sound effects, and it's better than the first one."
121;Maguire has done it again and brings life to Peter, exactly that way we Spiderman Fans from the 60's always imagined him to be.
122;the action is relentless and the human side of the story is touching and wonderful .
123;This is what a good summer movie should be.
124;man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero.
125;Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask.
126;Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider.
127;picking up two years after the first Spider.
128;And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.
129;man to finally bring peace into his life.
130;There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter.
131;In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker.
132;the standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart.
133;Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider.
134;man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic.
135;Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero.
136;man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most?
137;In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses.
138;man 2 definitely joins these ranks.
139;Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider.
140;I like it very much, especially because of its cool effects.
141;:) ),Sam does a much better job then in the first film(meaning brilliant!)
142;,the action scenes are far better as well,and Peter Parker's dimension is much better explored.
143;it's one of the only films that the word ''hero'' is greatly explained,too.
144;i got this movie for my son in 2004 and he really enjoy this movie he keeps watching this over and overhe is a big spiderman fan and this is better than the first but just a little bit.
145;My son and I love watching it together.
146;All in all, a good movie!
147;It has a wholly good plot, acting more perfect than the first, and so many more cool things happen in it, too.
148;Aunt May gets a couple of licks in herself, and Mary Jane is even more beautiful.
149;On top of all of that, this 10/10 film also has so many unexpected things happening in it!
150;I have most certainly said enough.
151;See it, for God's sake!
152;This is one of my favorite superhero movies.
153;Finely crafted in every way and is the directors cut to boot, all on Blu Ray.
154;I will reserve my comments about the movie itself for another forum.
155;I grew up reading comics as a kid, and Spidey was always my favorite.
156;Several decades later, I'm still enjoying the action and antics of NYC's one and only photog/arachnid.
157;This terrific sequel took the strengths of the first Spidey outing and built on them.
158;tobey Maguire is terrific as Peter and Spidey.
159;The humanity of Peter struggling with school, job, and love life is engaging, sad, and funny.
160;Alfred Molina is also fantastic as Doc Ock.
161;some of the comedy was a bit over the top.
162;All in all, a great mix of action, romance, laughs, and sheer adrenaline.
163;for fans of the genre, or just those looking for a solid two hours of entertainment, Spiderman 2 will not disappoint.
164;spider Man was one of the best movies I have seen all year!
165;All of my friends (ages: 41,42 and 50) went to go see it and it was so exhilarating, so entertaining, and so much fun to watch.
166;I could easily go back and see it again.
167;Have fun and go see Spidey!
168;If you enjoyed Spider Man, you'll love Spider Man 2.
169;In many ways it was better than the first movie.
170;I also enjoyed the scene where he saves a train load of people on a runaway elevated train and then collapses from exhaustion.
171;They made Spider Man very human and quite ordinary which is great.
172;"I know I know it was one of the ""best"" movies of the year and everyone loves it."
173;my favorite comics movies is still X. men.
174;i'm no huge comic book fan, and I had to keep reminding myself during the film that this is a comic book and not meant to be a realistic story.
175;the acting was good, the love story well done enough for the genre and all in all I was entertained and enjoyed the movie, however, I'm still sticking with the same assessment that I gave the first movie, it's just an average adventure story with great special effects.
176;The special effects were terrific and the storyline either had you grinning wickedly from ear to ear at Doc Ock's puns or you were petrified at the horrifics of his intentions.
177;This is truly a great comic book story because it is totally unebelievable, yet the audience sits and reacts as though they are taken in by the whole thing.
178;this was hilarious to watch at times and I needed to have a good laugh.
179;The storyline is familiar but the pulse of the media says the nation loves the familiarity.
180;i think this movie is a good movie if you like the cartoon version then this is a better movie the whole family should watch it its a good action thriller i think its a wonderful hero movie mabe even one of the best.
181;All the same stars return with a new star who is Alfred Molina a great person to do the part in this movie a great action movie that all generations most likely will love i saw it in theaters 2 times and a third time tommarrow so i again this is a great movie just like the first one even better.
182;man and absolutely loved it.
183;Spiderman 2 builds on the foundation of the previous movie and I can honestly say it worked quite well for me.
184;The character of Peter Parker continues to grow and become a man while his friends begin to wonder about him.
185;Nothing will stand in his way of achieving his goals.
186;Despite this, she knows it's her decision to make, not his.
187;harry has his epiphany and there is a foreshadowing as to what he will do and become in the next movie.
188;I liked the supervillain they had.
189;I enjoyed him in the role and part of me wishes he had lived in the end, but that was not to be.
190;man series is the most physically and emotionally realistic, as well as mythically and philosophically relevant, American super.
191;existential America, intelligently but simply emphasizing the idea of the individual and the importance of conscious choices in the shaping of world around him or her.
192;Emotionally, we see in Peter Parker an intelligent but otherwise normal man who often says and does stupid things, and we see a realistic emotional evolution of the man.
193;Most people can relate to this on a very personal leverl.
194;I speak of those beautiful near perfect ideals of manhood who perform acts of heroism and maintain ideal personal relationships, in other words doing things which are impossible to acheive even in our fantasies, and yet we see portrayed more than often in our culture's stories.
195;A film like this, and I cannot namer another like it, deftly reshapes the modern concept of what a hero is, and the production does it with a wonderful sense of humor and professional sangfroid.
196;And, hey, it has some of the most kick.
197;man 2' is probably the best superhero movie EVER!Plot holes or not, I still slightly prefer `The Dark Knight' (I love my superheroes to have a little grit on them).
198;man' was a nicely constructed origin story, `Spider.
199;man 2' becomes a brilliantly orchestrated expansion on that origin, complete with a profound moral structure that elevates the film from a mere `comic book movie'.
200;With a solid script that really gets to the heart of the characters and makes them real and relatable, `Spider.
201;man 2' is an outstanding film, no matter what genre you place it in.
202;It has layer upon layer of interesting and memorable development.
203;the film is, in a word, very complex (but that is a good thing).
204;This is making his budding romance with Mary Jane Watson more aggravating than it should be.
205;When you add to that a brilliant man controlled by his own genius (a marvelous Alfred Molina), you have a recipe for some exciting and provoking entertainment.
206;man 2' proves to be.
207;Sure, there is a lot going on, but everything maintains a crisp, slickness to it that establishes a sense of realism.
208;His attention to detail here is impeccable.
209;I love the way that Raimi captured what it felt like to read a Spider.
210;The film has this light and airy (colorful) feel to it, yet it is laced with that suspense that only comes from truly engrossing yourself in this character and his purpose.
211;and yet still, the most impressive facet of `Spider.
212;man 2' is the fact that it has a real heart.
213;He is not my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite characters, and my heart is welled up in this man because of what Maguire does here.
214;so, best superhero movie of all time?
215;this movie does a good job of staying on theme with the first in the series and moving the story ahead.
216;If you liked the first you have probobly seen this one as well.
217;He can never keep an appointment with Mary.
218;all of the actors did a superb job in this film.
219;The story remained strong, especially for a comic book film, and the effects were amazing.
220;This is definitely the ideal summer film.
221;Of course I wound up getting the first release as a gift, so now I'll have both.
222;This is a great movie, not to be missed.
223;man 2 is overall the most disconnected film in the original trilogy.
224;The humor was refreshing since it focused more on what everyone went and goes through.
225;"Whenever I saw the grandmother again on the screen, I had to laugh in remembrance of that ""falling"" moment."
226;There was action on the train, the walls, the air, and on the ground.
227;There were nice special effects with the action sequences too.
228;Plus the movie was so good to me, that I wouldn't have noticed if there were a couple action parts missing.
229;this movie is good even if you didn't watch the first one because I didn't and I got almost everything.
230;She is in love with Peter but gets engaged to this other guy.
231;Even with these tiny inconsistencies, the movie was absolutely great.
232;In todays world of gore and terrable movies that children cannot watch this is a very good one for the whole family.
233;The graffics were great and this movie actually had a good story line.
234;The train scene was great.
235;He's formidable enough for Spider man, faithful to the comic books.
236;And we didn't have too much of irratation in watching his evil plan formations and how he became what he is, it was smooth enough to make us understand, and quick enough to sit through.
237;The rest with him in it would be the breath.
238;But Spider Man 2 was really a SEQUAL, it was a continuation of the first one, and more character.
239;It was brilliant in the way that it's understandable, it's simple, and it's something we could all connect.
240;This twist is something we have seen in lots of other superhero movies, like in Superman 2.
241;Peter Parker started to enjoy school, do his homework, and actually for once made it to his heartthrop.
242;And the writer triumphed again in showing us, in that powerful fire.
243;But in the end my favorite twist.
244;This brilliant scene not only sticked to the whole theme about CHOICE, but that superpowers, like intelligence, is a gift to be used for the good of mankind.
245;But in this film it was so realistic: how do you manage to be 24/7 superhero AND manage to keep your job going?
246;And the irony in humor using was just great.
247;It was both funny and heart.
248;brakingThe cliffhanger in the end set up the third movie very well.
249;man 2 is the greatest superhero film ever made.
250;the action is stunning, the acting is wonderful, and the scene where an unconcious Peter Parker is saved by a train load of New York citizens will move you to tears.5 Stars.
251;This past week was the 10th Anniversary of one of the best and greatest Spider.
252;man 2 for the last 8 years, it's still one of the BEST Spider.
253;man movies ever and one of the GREATEST comic book movies period.
254;I love the new features that wasn't released on the original.
255;All of the above with the director's cut is that you get to see what scenes that were removed from the film earlier here like .
256;*Extended versions of the Train sequence, Pizza delivery scene, Peter's visit to the nurse, Peter's vision of seeing Uncle Ben.
257;*And rare scenes like J. Jonah Jameson wearing Spidey's suit in his office and Peter at Dr. Connors' class the first time.
258;Spiderman 2 has been labeled by many as the greatest superhero movie ever at best, and at least a very good movie probably better than the first.
259;So, I had high hopes going into this movie knowing I thoroughly enjoyed the first.
260;I enjoyed both movies because of the interaction and conflict between these characters.
261;the primary plot of the story, aside from Doc Ock, is Peter's love for Mary Jane.
262;The movie does such a great job of centering the entire conflict in the movie around Peter loving Mary Jane but constantly disappointing her.
263;A great way to resolve this would be for Peter to win Mary Jane's heart without Spiderman having anything to do with it.
264;overall, this is a good, solid movie, and the ending sets it up for a great Spiderman 3.
265;All they care about is fulfilling their purpose and they don't care who they have to hurt to recreate the device they were made for.
266;this movie thrills the inner fanboy much more than its predecessor and officially is my favorite so far in the Spider.
267;finish classic superhero goodness: stellar aerial battles, eye.
268;Tobey Maguire was extremely believable in this film and brought a real depth to Parker that.
269;j. k. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious as always, and Kirsten Dunst as MJ.
270;man 2 thrilled me to pieces.
271;You're in for an amazingly cool, web.
272;People really loved this movie, (myself included.)
273;developed, and it was just like a comic book.
274;It was even very funny and enjoyable.
275;In almost every scene, characters are always in tears.
276;Oh yeah, and there's a scientist who installed tentacles onto himself and is now on a violent rampage.
277;"A big scene showcased on the trailers and commercials ""Let's see who is behind the mask!"""
278;This movie actually has everything.
279;I'm a big fan of the first Spider.
280;It looks much more realistic in the first movie.
281;Pete's aunt is great, but seriously talks too much.
282;"It the first movie it came out great
283;but there are positive things too.
284;I gave it 3 starts because I think it was overall OK, it's very entertaining and fun.
285;man 2 has a HUGE heart.
286;It deals with everyday life questions and friedship and is very kind.
287;This one is without a doubt the best movie of 2004.
288;There's a good balance between the sympathetic backstory and the energy that lured us into the theaters.
289;There is a great deal of incredible web.
290;swinging as well, better than in the first film"
291;I dare say the animators have finally perfected their art here.
292;on the whole though, I loved this movie.
293;That's what made this a standout in the genre of comic superhero flicks, the real heroism of the human spirit embodied by Peter Parker.
294;I enjoyed the first film and just like X2 I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel even more.
295;The effects were much improved from the first film.
296;His scenes were some of the funniest in the film and accurately brings to life the character from the comics.
297;The overall tone of the film and its script has the feel of a comic book.
298;This is a comic book film and as such I went into it thinking of it as one.
299;The effects work on Ock's helpers has to be some of the best FX work I have seen.
300;and for all Evil Dead fans, Raimi was generous enough to bring in Bruce He is God Campbell to make a cameo in one of the funnier scenes in the film.
301;for a summer blockbuster and comic book superhero film, I recommend this film.
302;man 2 succeeds and entertains.
303;Absolutely loved those train fight and save scenes.
304;"I will take back my earlier words
305;made films of 2004 (delivering all the goods in effects, writing, directing, and acting!)
306;, but one of the best superhero films EVER.
307;A great ride from start to finish, and director Sam Raimi not only twisted the movie into something uniquely Raimi (like Doc Ock's hospital scene, pure Raimi!)
308;See if you can spot them all!S.
309;m2 isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy superheroes, comic book adaptations, action/adventure movies, or just the wallcrawler, you should enjoy this movie too!
310;A great setup for the third movie too!The special features are LOADED, lots to check out.
311;I'm glad they didn't do this, the director actually said that this movie pretty much has about the same amount of action sequences as the first, and while this does seem true, it doesn't take away from the movie at all.
312;Because now since we have more character development, we care more now for each character involved in the story.
313;The reason we feel this way this time around is because we see how vulnerable Peter Parker is.
314;And we know that his worries about his own personal life can interfere with his ability to fight supervillians.
315;I saw this movie 5 times while it was in theaters and I highly recommend it.
316;that, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series.
317;show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.
318;although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.
319;Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.
320;The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.
321;Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.
322;When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.
323;Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day.
324;He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge.
325;The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.
326;It is over, and Peter knows it.
327;The love of a woman, or her life?
328;Spiderman 2 is a great movie.
329;door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously.
330;Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.
331;key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging.
332;Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing.
333;This feels like a real film with real characters.
334;blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic.
335;book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue.
336;cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in.
337;wink, thigh slapping gusto, and there is enough humour and drama in the ending to make most readers forget the tedium of the the middle third.
338;I really enjoyed the first Spider.
339;It was one of the best movies of 2002.
340;I liked it so much, in fact, I went out and bought a personal copy for my home collection.
341;Now I wont be excited for Spider.
342;This is a wonderful movie, however, there are some frightening scenes/images for young children.
343;My 4 year old loves Spiderman and I took him to Spiderman 1 without any problems.
344;it is much more action packed than the first one, which is great.
345;There's also more of a love story theme in this one as well.
346;Okay first off I will say that the idea of this was a good one.
347;Mostly the extended fight scenes with Spidey and Ock.
348;I do like the theatrical version better.
349;Yes, of course SPIDERMAN 2 has a lot of CGI.
350;I saw Sam Raimi's first SPIDERMAN in 2002 and thought it was actually a good movie.
351;Yes, typically in superhero films, there is a love interest, but the hero isn't acting like a sap for the entirety of the film!
352;I've got to say that while Dunst was immensely appealing in the first SPIDERMAN, Raimi doesn't do a good job of making her look appealing at all in this sequel.
353;I am very pleased at this great deal and i am also very happy with getting it so quick.
354;But a superior sequel, while rare, does happen.
355;Just look at """"Aliens"""" and """"Terminator 2"""", among few others."""
356;And so Sam Raimi and his cast and crew have done one of those rare hollywood achievements.
357;A big Hollywood sequel that's so much better than the original.
358;I am surprised with how well I took in the franchise because I was never a Spider.
359;Besides all that, there is the ongoing story of Peter's love for the lovely Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst).
360;And this is what's so great about the movie, and how it foes against the expected Hollywood conventions.
361;In these movies, the movie is about the people.
362;Raimi and his writers create characters that, under some odd circumstances, are real.
363;It's about the story and characters, and in this day and age, that is so refrshing and welcomed.
364;The actors here are as good as ever.
365;Maguire continues to prove that he is an excellent Peter Parker, and makes a convincing super hero.
366;James Franco is good, but his obsession with revenge got old pretty fast.
367;Alfred Molina was so much more likeable as the villain, because he had the humanity left in him.
368;It was also nice that J. k. Simmons and Rosemary Harris got bigger roles as well.
369;And yes, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell makes another welcomed cameo.
370;I won't say what they are, but it will bring a new dynamic to the ongoing storyline for Part 3.
371;man 2 has been hailed as the best superheo movie ever, and while I have another one that takes that place, this one is definitley strong enough to take that title.
372;man 3 that much more exciting.
373;This movie is one of my favorite.
374;Because I can't love somebody.
375;He is the best hero.
376;It has wonderful special effects and the story line is exceptinal as well.
377;He lives in a run.
378;It's a wonderful movie and I can't wait until Sam Raimi makes Spider.
379;If you want to see what happens between Peter and M. j. you should really see this movie!
380;This movie is SO Spider.
381;The action is intense, great script, great actors!
382;Out of all sequels that come out every year, this is the best one I have seen in a long time!
383;Toby Maguire is so charming as Peter Parker and so sexy as Spiderman, as we saw in the first film.
384;I am personally not a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst, but she does very well in this movie as well.
385;And once you see the end you know there will be a 3rd movie!
386;And you can't help but look forward to that!
387;mAN 2 is absolutely terrific.
388;the actors are uniformly excellent, all of them given real parts to play.
389;As I said in my review of the first movie, the people trashing the first two Spider.
390;man movies are excellent, it's the third one that ruined the series.
391;His best friend is out to get Spiderman.
392;When the action picks up that is all it is just action.
393;Doctor Octopus is an absolutely fantastic supervillain.
394;And those mechanical arms are really something to see in 3.
395;d at home using a new kind of 3.
396;man 2 looked really great.
397;The actor managed to make Doc.
398;My favorite scenes were when Doc.
399;man have a fight on a moviing train were awesome!This movie had a good solid storyline, and plot, as well as some of the best characterization of any of the Marvel franchise movies.
400;The action scenes were intense (especially in 3.
401;While they were definitely eye candy, they were also important to the storyline.
402;It looked amazing, especially the Sandman and the final battle between all the characters.
403;man movies have been brilliant examples that comic books are not just for kids, and that entertaining, meaningful stories can still be told, even with superheroes.
404;i highly recommend this movie, and the others in the series.
405;I feel that Spider Man 2 was an action.
406;Overall I definitely recommend Spider Man 2 to anyone who is looking for a great film to watch.
407;It has tons action for the people who love action.
408;The movie also has an underlying love story that I feel makes the movie all the more realistic.
409;So all in all, this movie is on the fence between 4 and 5 stars, so it is most certainly a must see!
410;I thoroughly found this movie to be genuinely warm and appealing.
411;A good movie through and through with the above exception.
412;Watch them after you see the completed work though.
413;Spiderman 2 is a great movie and has recieved tons of accolades so I went into it expecting the best.
414;It lives up to its billing.
415;Tobey McGuire is great as the bumbling Peter Parker who has to deal with the pressures of leading a normal life while at the same time being a super hero.
416;Kristen Dunst is beautiful as the vulnerable Mary Jane who deep down loves Peter but has been able to move on to another man.
417;James Franco is good as the tormented Harry Osborne who values Peter as a friend but is still haunted by his father's death by Spiderman.
418;harry continues his quest to discover the identity of Spiderman.
419;but the best part of the plot is between Mary Jane and Peter.
420;As a viewer, I wanted Peter to somehow let Mary Jane know he does love her and redeem Peter in her eyes.
421;the movie takes a surprising turn in the end and throws all the conflict between Mary Jane and Peter away by revealing in the battle with Doc Ock that Peter is really Spiderman.
422;man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a stupendous sequel to an amazing superhero movie.
423;man and Kirsten Dunst is so beautiful.
424;The music is great and is right on mark for a super hero movie.
425;The script is very well written and one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time.
426;I highly recommend it and I give it 5 well deserved stars.
427;Spiderman 2 has romance, action and is very character driven.
428;He stops and he still is a hero.
429;Anyway I loved this movie.
430;Please keep in mind Spiderman is a comic book hero and has been for several several years.
431;It's much better on the screen but you can go back and read it also if you like that.
432;After all the hype, I went to see this movie with very high expectations.
433;On the positives: Great story, great casting, fantastic special effects, great villian, good acting, no foul language, no nudity, and some great action sequences.
434;Every stinking superhero movie made now has the hero unmasking himself(Batman, Superman, Spider Man, Daredevil, etc).
435;In the comics, these characters take great care in protecting their identity.
436;In these flicks, the hero's are all too happy to allow themselves to be unmasked to everyone.
437;Peter Parker reveals himself to just about everyone: Mary Jane, Doc Ock, Harry Osbourne, and a train car full of people.
438;in conclusion, this movie is still top notch and I recommend it too all.
439;man 2 not only maintains the extroadinary story telling, action, and acting from the previous film, but it improves!
440;It is arguably the best Marvel film of all time!
441;man 2 is an inspiring and exciting tale that will have you wanting to watch again and again.
442;like I said about the first film, the best part about this film is its story.
443;One of the best things about this film are Spider.
444;Both come with their positives and negatives, and Spider.
445;The stress that he has to deal with is something of us have to deal with.
446;Choices are very important, and sometimes it can be hard to make the right choice.
447;the other great thing about this film is the villain.
448;He believes what he is doing is right, even if he is being controlled by his mechanic arms.
449;With a villain that you can feel sorry for, Dok Ock brings further emotion and excitement to the story.
450;man 2 is a must see for both fans and newcomers alike.
451;Good paceing and great effects make it enjoyable.
452;(Sorry, Stan, but it's true.)
453;If you're one of those pompous critics who thinks a movie needs to be deep, realistic and profoundly thought.
454;human strength and agility who slings his way across the city fighting criminals and saving the day.
455;In other words, it's about action.
456;"The movies aren't meant to be cerebral
457;the special effects are breathtaking"
458;which, of course, is the heart and soul target audience of this franchise .
459;you'll find that the story is right on the money, with a few gleeful plot twists and moving moments thrown in.
460;man 2 is the best realization of a comic.
461;man 2 is really great and intellgent the movie is about peter parker being depress of his hero duties and that he can't be with mary jane.
462;"As far as ""best superhero movie ever"" goes, I'll still stick with the first Superman and Batman movies and perhaps even Daredevil."
463;I would recommend for any age.
464;kind of a male version of Paris Hilton.
465;man 1, you'll love Spider.
466;This is an awesome movie.
467;It's the best of all 3 of the trilogy as it goes deeper into Peter Parker than Spider.
468;The actors do a fantastic job.
469;Better than that, he knows how to play a Peter Parker.
470;She plays it with passion and with expression.
471;I love it when the hero gets his [back] kicked!
472;"taking fight sequences during the bank robbery and on the train have been added to in subtle, but brilliant, ways
473;They work wonderfully, the result feeling even closer to the scrappy, up.
474;man 2 superior to the theatrical release.
475;man 2.1 is an interesting experiment that didn't really need to be conducted.
476;Even so, those interested enough to watch Spider.
477;man 2.1 will most likely find it intriguing and get some enjoyment from this unnecessary but harmless curiosity.
478;Following up on the tremendous success of the first Spider.
479;man 2' swung into action two years later in '04 re.
480;uniting Maguire, Dunst and Franco and most of the original cast in a sequel worthy of its predecessor.
481;The death of his best friends Father and his beloved Uncle Ben, his inability to share his secret with the girl he loves and the heavy responsibility of being a superhero take a toll on a young man.
482;There are many who think so and they may be right, but either way it's definitely a welcomed addition to the Spider.
483;The writers and producers have captured Pete's dilemma perfectly.
484;His portrayal of Peter Parker, with all his strength, frailty (and borderline neurosis) is perfect.
485;Kirsten Dunst excels as his foil.
486;She's the one who most wants most to believe that there's an explanation and that he's really trying, regardless of how things look.
487;The emotional range given to these characters is immense and the principles involved capture it without becoming excessive.
488;the role the supporting characters play is just as pivotal to the success of the film.
489;If there are more sequels it'll be interesting to see what the producers give him to do with it.
490;He was given more to work with as well.
491;He's sympathetic character who's capable of great evil, one that's compassionate but monstrous and brilliant but ruled by his ego.
492;He manages each and every facet of the role with great aplomb.
493;His performance is a triumph.
494;without these facets intact some of the greatest action scenes ever done and any amount of fabulous CGI work would be meaningless.
495;Peter Parker was (and still is) the great 'every.
496;The producers of the films have made it a point to stay true to that.
497;Because of that, the CGI work (which is excellent), and the action scenes (which are exceptionally well done) only serve to enhance a film was already well on its way to being a great one.
498;and this is a great one.
499;This was a great movie.
500;It took it right out of the comics books.
501;I liked the first one but this one surpasses it on EVERY level.
502;the story is more engaging"
503;a brilliant story, a brilliant movie.
504;Superb acting from the entire cast, one of the best if not THE best super hero movie ever.
505;took the kids and another adult to see it.
506;of course the effects were good, and if you do the movie, be prepared to have your finger on the fast.
507;His grandmother is behind on her mortgage, and he just wallows in self.
508;due mortgage, I figured he'd spring into action and at least take a few pictures of himself to sell to the newspaper.
509;the theater was close to packed the day I went.
510;I noticed one laugh from the audience, some mild amusement about two times, and that was it.
511;mAN 2 is one of the best movies ever, in my opinion.
512;lots of heart, great characters, great writing, great action, great moral to the story, great performances and special effects!
513;"This is all good until they start pulling out the original scenes choices and replace it with this ""new"" footage."
514;You get a scene with MJ talking with her friend about marrying the astronaut, and the perfect kiss from her fantasy man (as seen in SPIDER.
515;This changes the tone of the scene immensely, in that being Spider.
516;This Director's Commentary is pretty interesting, with some fun trivia and insight into the writing and production, despite the absence of the actual director and any actor from the film.
517;the bonus disk is okay.
518;But, if you already own and love the original version, then get this 2.1 version and watch it with a friend, and have fun pointing out and finding the new stuff.
519;I did not particularly like the first Spiderman, so I was thoroughly surprised when I saw the second.
520;It is also much more emotional than its predecessor.
521;This is my most favorite movie of the year.
522;Great deal on this movie!
523;this movie is as entertaining as a libary.
524;and the part when the banana got his job as a repair was funny as Toby Maguire's acting
525;It improves in almost every aspect.
526;I thought that this would be a good movie, but I was still skeptical about it because it was a sequel.
527;this movie's greatest attribute is obviously its special effects, but it has a lot more to show for than just that.
528;It has an amazing and incredible plot'line and will leave you wanting more when it ends.
529;This is a terrific movie for the viewer who likes action films and for the viewer who enjoys seeing a story as well.
530;Tobey Maguire's detailed portrayal of his character is outstanding and is really entertaining.
531;This will give you a fair and honest view of the characters, story and the movie itself.
532;In order for Otto so sustain the fusion reaction he's developed artificially intelligent arms that attach directly to his spine that he can control as if they were additional arms.
533;doc Oc: Played by Alfred Molina this is an intelligent choice for Doc Oc as he genuinely looks like the Doc Oc from the comics.
534;He gives us his own brand of intelligence and sophistication when showing us the mental anguish that the character is going through in the movie.
535;James Franco is great at playing the tormented figure of Harry Osborn.
536;the Verdict: This is clearly the strongest film of the three, the action sequences particularly the fight sequence on the train is one that really gets your heart racing.
537;Alfred Molina really fits the Doc Oc character perfectly and he really makes it believable.
538;It has the general comedy moments that help you relax after witnessing a strongly emotive scene or a high impact fight sequence.
539;The mixture of CGI and real life is un.
540;seamless which gives it all the more realistic look.
541;This is a movie that every comic book fan should own and enjoy for many years to come.
542;man 2 is a clever, fun, and suspenseful movie.
543;It's a good sequel, with a good anatomy and interesting and unique characters.
544;Peter Parker is juggling a job, a dying relationship with the beautiful and popular MJ, his guilt at his uncle's death, and, of course, how could I forget, his superhero secret identity, Spider.
545;He is admired by scientific genius Peter Parker, who attends the demonstration for the power source.
546;MJ is engaged to a famous astronaut, and Harry is financially broke, and descending into alcoholism.
547;romance movie that can be geared to kids, teens, and adults, and they will all find it thrilling, fun, romantic, and cool.
548;tobey Maguire is cute, strong, and does a wonderful job, as does the beautiful and expressive Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina, whom I am sure had the time of his life.
549;The movie had good sound, an excellent soundtrack, and an experienced cast and crew.
550;It matches the first and is the perfect sequel.
551;It captures the cartoon effect while still being realistic.
552;The movie is just a little formulaic, but still a brilliant piece!Do yourself a favor, and go see Spider.
553;Be sure to get there early, because there is sure to be a crowd seeing this marvelous film.
554;If you've already seen it, see it again, it's well worth the effort and price!
555;Sure, the original films are lots of fun, but the sequels take things to a whole new level.
556;Spiderman 2 is much more fleshed out and emotional, much more focused on character development, and downright operatic at times.
557;On the other hand there's Alfred Molina as the wonderful Doctor Octopus, one of the most excellent villians of all time.
558;And beyond that there are just so many clever little touches to this film that it becomes one of the best superhero movies ever made.
559;It was still a good movie, just not great as many hailed it to be.
560;better acting, better story, and basically a better movie.
561;It did accomplish that but not without some flaws.
562;well, I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the first one but that's only because they decided to add so many cheesy one.
563;well scripted scenes for scenes that should be more improv, and fan.
564;service (scenes where fans will derive more enjoyment from ala Yoda fight in Star Wars Episode 2).
565;The acting was subpar on the part of James Franco, who I like a lot, but I will put that of because of direction and his character.
566;Tobey and Kirsten did a lot better this time around, and the other supporting characters really do shine.
567;I was surprised a few times that they decided to go a certain way already and my prediction for the villain of the third movie that I gathered since the first seems to be pretty much set (with possibilities of more).
568;The plot and characters were a lot more developed, spending time to accentuate those that needed it.
569;There was an imbalance of stories between that of Tobey's life as Peter Parker and that of Spiderman.
570;polished as X2 and definitely had some flaws.
571;It was great, definitely better than Spider.
572;The story was well developed and the acting was terrific.
573;Anyone who's read the comics will see the similarties.
574;fight scenes were very well choreographed and the CGI was amazing.
575;man and Doc Ock are battling for the first time.
576;"I do believe the only competition that Spiderman 2 has for ""best superhero movie"" is Batman."
577;The first Superman movie was fine except for Louis Lane and the very end of that damn movie.
578;peter Parker's struggles between being a working student and a crime fighter, along with his love for Mary Jane are perfect subplots between his many violent encounters with Doc Ock.
579;Excellent visual effects and the pacing is perfect.
580;And of course, it gives a very tasty sequel ending which will keep the fans wanting more for #3.
581;The opening credits are unique in that they play out the first film in a way that those who haven't seen it will probably catch on quick with the rest of us.
582;Much better than the original film.
583;But, at the time of SM2's release, I was still quite unimpressed with Director Raimi's first offering of Spider.
584;This wasn't just a fun little popcorn movie like the first.
585;man 2 is a fun, light, (sometimes campy) movie.
586;man movie series into a full.
587;man 2 above almost any other superhero movie to date.
588;"at the center of it all is, obviously, Peter Parker
589;And, honestly, he does a pretty spectacular job of it.
590;Carrying over from his performance in SM1, Maguire adds a greater amount of depth and believability, that improves his character, and in turn, the film as a whole.
591;Molina was simply born to play the roll.
592;Though, the real beauty of the performance, I believe, is Molina's perfect execution of serious acting, with a light, often """"fun"""" delivery."""
593;"It's just Molina having fun with a role
594;Molina's Doc Ock may very well be the best film villain yet in a superhero movie.
595;As Peter's grouchy, demanding boss, Simmons' delivers corny line after corny line with such skill and ease that he transcend the normal (negative) bounds of camp, and turns it into something that's actually fun, and extremely enjoyable.
596;The rest of the supporting cast is strong, though not particularly memorable, and Rosemary Harris, James Franco, etc. all deserve mention for their roles in the film.
597;He captures the mood of Spider.
598;man's word perfectly, both storywise, and visually.

600;His crafting of the story is also quite enjoyable.

602;"down"" quite apt in regards to the story
603;man epic feel of the movie.
604;luckily, the romance does little damage to the film overall"
605;Which in the end leaves us with what is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put on film.9/10
606;Though it was your typical summer blockbuster fare, it has something for everyone.
607;We follow Peter Parker through the ups and downs of jugglingv being Spiderman , working, school and his romance with Mary Jane ( the beautiful Ms. Dunst).
608;The most insightful character in the entire movie had to be the Aunt.
609;"Even though her lines were sappy, she proclaimed the message of the movie, ""There is a hero in all of us""."
610;He is very talented though and in the movie you could feel his struggle with the pain of his Dad's death by Spiderman.
611;This movie was fantastic and be sure to check it out b/c your summer wont be right without it.
612;Yeah, but you knew what I meant).
613;on true to the comic, from Peter's real.
614;"in the words of Comic Book Guy, ""Best."
615;a really fabulous movie about epic Do.
616;good that interferes with the usual life of merely ordinary achievement?
617;always liable to have super.
618;It is epic Idealism, all to the GOOD.
619;it's a very uplifting movie, in more than one way, to say the least.
620;whoever designed the intricacies of all the battles and special effects in the movie is a real.
621;life super Genius with a wild and daring sense of engineering!
622;real, scarry effect of an immense amount of shattered glass flying out of the screen in one scene.
623;i'm really enthusiastic about this movie and recommend it highly.
624;I enjoy it and like it from a feminine point of view, but I'd venture to say that for guys it would be at least as exciting as watching a Super.
625;Spiderman 2 is a great movie.
626;It's emotional without going overboard and it's funny as well.
627;It'll keep you entertained for two hours.
628;"His beloved Mary Jane Watson, who's made it as a model and on Broadway, is mad at him because he hasn't come to see her in ""The Importance of Being Earnest."""
629;"In the end, his solution is to ""hang it up""."
630;"Gradually, with Aunt May's unwitting help, he realizes that his Uncle Ben was right: great powers require great responsibility, and he'll ""always be Spiderman."
631;Besides the continuing angst that is a Marvel trademark, this film is distinguished (of course) by eye.
632;perhaps not *quite* so good as those in the first installment (when Doc Ock climbs up a wall, you can tell it's a computer animation), but still very impressive.
633;(The following scene, in which the rescued passengers gently and carefully draw him into the car and to safety, is all the more affecting on account of the contrast.)
634;Both Spidey and Ock are human.
635;And there's a great surprise at the end of the film that makes all of Spidey's trials worthwhile.
636;Though probably not for the youngest and most sensitive members of the family, this is a great wild adventure ride for everyone else, and may well serve as a launching point for some good conversations about ethics, perseverance, and the definition of heroism.
637;This sequel is yet another worthy follow up from Sam Raimi, who've done a splendid job in recreating the SPIDERMAN Mythos for the present cinema's movie industry.
638;who is perfect for the role's bill I should say.
639;"reminds you of WWF's peak years back in the eighties, but only a lot more higher notch in the way the fight scenes are executed of course
640;man"""" was released in 2002, I was amazed to see how good of a movie that Sam Raimi and writer David Koepp created about a comic book super hero."""
641;Tobey Maguire gives an amazing performance is this installment, a better performance than the first.
642;Thank God that he was able to make this movie.
643;Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemarry Harris also return for this movie.
644;The new memeber Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock and does a pretty good job.
645;The most important person that came back for the sequel was Sam Raimi.
646;The direction of this movie, along with the first one, are what make the movies great.
647;There is a lot of human emotion involved in the storyline.
648;My only grievence with the movie is that it moved slower than the first.
649;Otherwise this movie is excellent.
650;Its really too hard to choose which one is better.
651;It's the same basic story, but with an entirely new feel.
652;The elevator scene is longer and funnier, the action scenes are even more exciting, and there's a scene with Jonah and Spidey's suit that is priceless.
653;"the bonus features are good, with a ""Making Of"", commentary, a trivia track and a preview of Spidey 3."
654;Excellent storyline, incredible graphics and special effects.
655;Doc Ock is an excellent character development, and played masterfully by Alfred Molina.
656;Excellent Casting, Direction and Production.
657;Masterful artwork on the CGI and special.
658;aided graphics in terms of the viewing, which plauged movies even just a few years ago.
659;With over 40 years of comic books to tap into, most of which were outstanding in their own right, there is abundant material to make this a landmark series that can go on for years to come.
660;"ups as well as this picture (and the original) without butchering them by ""skipping"" or ""cramming"", which happens often (Marvel Take Note: Franchise Series."
661;5 Stars for a job well done across the board.
662;hands down the best superhero movie ever made, it catches every moment that we rememmber of spiderman from the sixties.
663;superb melodrama, great acting, and wonderful set pieces that will remain in our memories forever.
664;great truthful writing that we ALL can relate to.
665;This movie blew my mind away.
666;man's more colorful cast of villians.
667;minute guarantee expires, shows a full range of emotion .
668;man, a newfound joy enters his life and he is finally able to pursue without abandon both his studies and the girl next door .
669;This sequel is leaps and bounds better than the original and something that you can lie back and enjoy on a weekday night after a long day of work.
670;My expectations for this movie were really high and i assumed it was going to be great.
671;The only real thing this movie had to offer were some pretty cool action scenes which i did enjoy, thanks computer nerds.
672;Fine performances by the leads were enhanced by the tremendous special effects.
673;An excellent movie not just a weak rip off of an earlier work.
674;The product is perfect condition and the speed at which it was delivered was absolutely amazing!
675;10 times better than the first moie ever will be.
676;Tobey Maguire is absolutely brilliant as Spider.
677;The only good thing about this movie was that the cgi was really good.
678;I found myself enjoying Parker's problems and interactions as much as Spidey's.
679;but the acting was passable and the story and action tremendous.
680;There are times I'm in the mood for both.
681;whichever format you like, get it.
682;I bought this used and it completed the set of Spiderman movies.
683;The latest franchise film is Spider.
684;man was probably the best comic book film ever made.
685;Maguire, especially, is so good an actor that he is 1 of those rarities that can run a panoply of emotions through just his eyes.
686;He is almost irresistible to watch onscreen.
687;All in all, a very good film, and along with the 1st film, simply the best superhero films ever made.
688;I hope the writers from this film stick with the whole series because, next to Batman, Spidey probably has the best pantheon of villains in comic book lore.
689;But, what makes good writing in such a film valuable are the little moments.
690;Sam Raimi proves he is a director who knows how to milk a proven commodity without imposing his own distorted `vision' on it.
691;The important question is, do you like comic.
692;Sam Raimi does a magnificent job with every aspect of this movie.
693;He recaps the first movie in drawings over the opening titles, and away we go.
694;The visual effects are much better than the first movie and the story line is more involved and, being Spider.
695;It is touching in the way it is handled.
696;These are good actors portraying these roles.
697;It is an outlandish story, but played as if they were real people and all this exotic reality were perfectly normal.
698;It is interesting how they create him in this film.
699;There is a sequence on an elevated train that is absolutely superb.
700;and I respect honest criticism so I won't go over anything else that everyone has already said, so I will keep my following remarks after seeing the film brief:Loved:.
701;"He reminded me of ""The Front Page"" or any other of one of those marvelous old snappy patter movies)
702;more dramatic and comic interaction with Spidey and the police, Spidey with JJJ and Spidey with the villans.
703;remember Spidey is Peter's true self coming out and that is a confident, devil.
704;care personality that uses his spikey sense of humor as a weapon in itself.
705;It still was a good movie and stayed true to the comic book.
706;Good family movie because the kids loved it.
707;it came in brand new like they said but the comic had a rip on about half the pages when i opened it
708;When I first saw the movie I liked it very much.
709;He's a superhero, a college student, an employee,and still tries to show intrest for his love Mary Jane.
710;But he really realizes that he's a natural superhero who was born to save the world.
711;realistic to carry alot of weight.
712;I felt Doc Ock to be well.
713;Hopefully the third film in this series will better display what spidey fans have loved about the charactor for years, and be a worthy film at the same time.
714;The special effects in this one are just as good as the first!
715;As with all superhero sequels, the main protaganist will be faced with new problems (personal,social,professional,etc.) as well as a new super.
716;The first time round is the charm.
717;I don't mind the exposition, but this is a superhero movie!
718;I thought it was the best movie that I saw!
719;I loved the scene were Doc OC and SPider man were fighting on and in the train I thought it was the coolest scene and movie!
720;Those July reviews served as my motivation to go see what I had hoped was a sensational action blockbuster.
721;It's not that Spiderman II is a bad movie, it's not, it is very watchable, but Jaws and Jurassic Park were sensational summer action movies that moved you emotionally .
722;Spiderman II is a good, passable action movie like Spiderman I, but it is not sensational.
723;man' film, """"With great power comes great responsibility"""", and in this case that is very true."""
724;After the sheer brilliance that was `Spider.
725;man', Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had a great responsibility to make at least an equally impressive film.
726;man 2' (yes I did say `privileged') then you know that they succeeded in delivering a top.
727;Giving us sharper graphics, deeper story lines and excellent acting, `Spider.
728;man 2' is utterly fantastic.
729;man 2' serves as top.
730;notch entertainment, ready and willing to please any who watch it.
731;Here's to hoping Sam and company can keep this up!
732;this movie is great i just went to see it today the first day it came out.
733;from action packed start to action packed end its great its had great action a good love story and just a straight out deep story with a chrachter like peter parker than every one can relate to.
734;i loved the forst one but this one beats it by far and doc oc is great go see it trust me its a great movie.
735;This is another great sequal made in the movie industry.
736;this movie, toby put on a much better preformance and did an excellent job as spider man.
737;but overall a very good film and is suited for all ages.
738;Point is, The Amazing Spiderman Blue.
739;ray, has the following: Better script, better acting, better depiction of The Webbed Avenger, and better graphics.
740;gotta get it and hoping the third movie will be just as good.
741;watch these if you have kids to make you are comfortable letting them watch depending on their ages.
742;'Spiderman 2' could possibly be the perfect movie.
743;It has action, suspense, romance, drama, and isn't too complicated for the younger audiences.
744;Kids will wow it, adults will be amazed by it.
745;He is Spiderman, and he is Peter Parker at the same time.
746;As we learned in the first installation, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' Parker is forced to take this to heart .
747;trying to maintain the delicate balance between Spiderman, being a student, having a job, and making time for friends and family.
748;The psychological aspect of the film is worth five stars alone.
749;the fight scenes are also stunning.
750;There is more feeling in these scenes, especially as Spiderman's identity is unveiled to the world (on the train).
751;'Spiderman 2' is a sublime movie also because it gives us the power to choose.
752;I'm pleased to find another movie franchise that is able to sustain itself (unlike the Matrix or Star Wars).
753;Spidey is full of angst and is broke.
754;hero who couldn't pay his bills?The FX are flawless and Elfman's score is great as always.
755;what we find here is solid character development and plot complications.
756;i was excited by the characters' interaction and the general plot arch.
757;I'm no Spiderman authority (I'd have to consult my Foushee guide for plot points, but I've sadly lost that guide), but I think it is a solid second chapter in the story.
758;man 2, to me, is the greatest movie out of all the Spider.
759;It is even better with the extended cut, Spider.
760;"What is it that makes ""Spider."
761;"man 2"" better and more enjoyable than the original film?"
762;Is it Alfred Molina's terrific role as Doc Ock?
763;Is it the smarter script that includes more genuine humor?
764;i despised it, loathed it all the more for having anticipated it so much.
765;sweet, and the spectacle of the two masked super.
766;faced!I can report that Spider.
767;man 2 is not only a deleriously enjoyable film in its own right, but it is that rarest of sequels: the sequel that makes its predecessor better by virtue of its sheer existence.
768;man 2 succeeds in large part because of the camera.
769;man has found a worthy foe, and the flick its lodestone, in the tormented and complicated Dr. Octavius, played to perfection by Molina.
770;man 2 shines: its judicious, effective use of CGI.
771;That realism gives the film a gritty heft, a raw physicality, missing from other CGI.
772;these guys are good for at least another picture, especially Doc Ock!
773;By the way that one was immaculate too, you gotta see it.
774;Anyways, I saw a trailer for Spider Man 2 before it came on and judging from what I saw, this will be hands down the greatest movie of the summer and I think it will shoot up to the money mark the first one made perhaps even more so.
775;Like the first, it will sport good CGI battle sequences and pyrotechnics.
776;But I hope that Molina can pull his character off.
777;He looked like a good candidate for Ock in the trailer, but it's like the lesson I learned last summer.
778;But I hope that Spidey 2 can pull the tricks that made the original so good.
779;But the completely new scenes are good.
780;up was able to focus on the action and adventure without losing focus on what for me was the best part of the picture .
781;It was an interesting parting shot that tied up that storyline nicely (at least until the next movie).
782;I for one will more than likely be picking up the one to be released at the end of this month.
783;The ending definitly set you up for maybe another movie.
784;I'd strongly recommend this if your looking for a good movie to see in theatres.
785;Spidy two was just as entertaining as Spidy one.
786;numbers special effects, but enjoyable nonetheless.
787;Kirsten Dunst brings the movie home as Mary.
788;"man 2"" should be viewed as the logical extension of an ongoing saga."
789;The first film did an excellent job of explaining the origins of Spider.
790;The second film explores what it actually means to be Spider.
791;Tobey Maguire does an excellent job in showing the angst of being a superhero.
792;Alfred Molina is outstanding as Otto Octavius.
793;"It's refreshing that the filmmakers have cast an actor for their appropriateness for the role instead of some major star who just bring their name to the proceedings i. e. the ""Batman"" films."
794;Once again Sam Raimi brings a sure hand to the proceedings and Alvin Sargent should be commended for writing a script that adds depth and shading to the characters.
795;man 2 has one of the most Coolest of the Spider.
796;man it was so cool on how they did it.
797;I have to give credit to sam raimi on makeing such good movies and finding good actors to play the parts.
798;man film five stars, but this one is even better.
799;as spectacular as the action is, there is a human dimension to this film that adds so much depth to it.
800;mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) romance ends up exactly where it should at the end of this film, showing that this series has much more respect for the intelligence of its characters than the Superman series ever did.
801;This film has a lot of heart.
802;After a spectacular battle atop a moving train, Spider.
803;The sequence is exciting, funny, and the way the passengers treat the exhausted Spider.
804;man after he has saved their lives is extremely touching.
805;Great work from the cast, as well as director Sam Raimi and writers Alfred Sargent, Michael Gough, Miles Millar and Michael Chabon.
806;hero movie ever made, but it is easily the best summer blockbuster ever.
807;It evokes every kind of human emotion.
808;The special effects are quite literally breath.
809;This movie has earned a spot as one of my all.
810;I am going to say that Spiderman 2 was superior to the original, and I greatly enjoyed the original.
811;And of course the movie delivered on the Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell cameos.
812;I was surprised to see willem defoe return.
813;The action scenes are spectacular, despite the beatings spidey took, i cringed when he fell off the building and bounced off those two cars.
814;though excellent, this film does have its flaws.
815;I didn't particularly enjoy the first movie, so I was a bit skeptical for this one.
816;The acting improved and the characters seemed natural, and the cast fit their roles perfectly.
817;Bruce Campbell had an excellent scene in this movie, and I can't wait to see what he's going to be in the next one.
818;Spiderman 2 is absolutely The Best superhero movie ever.
819;Not only does is the acting superb all the way thru.
820;"But it gives a very hi ""pole vault"" for the 3rd one to come forward."
821;It definitely gives a great set.
822;The 1st time I saw it, all the people in the movie theatre came only to see it.
823;He's misunderstood by his aunt, his boss, that loudmouth at the Daily Bugle, and the love of his life.
824;Still haunted by the memory of his uncle Ben, he knows that it's his destiny to help those who are in trouble.
825;For over two hours, we're brought into the life of this young man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders.
826;And by the time the closing credits roll, we realize that we've been given something special.
827;"man is not only a continuation of the ""original"" in their franchise, it's far superior."
828;it superior for many reasons: It boasts a tighter script, cleaner directing, better effects, richer acting, and even has a villain without a plastic halloween mask.
829;And finally, it has a resolution to Peter's hidden struggle, his love for Mary Jane.
830;Really, this is the best movie of 2004 and if the Academy had any sense, it would be a Best Picture nominee.
831;peter Parker struggles with being a regular person and a superhero.
832;watching Peter struggle with all of this, lose his confidence, give up Spider.
833;man and try and be normal shows how great a performance Tobey Maguire puts on.
834;Critics loved the movie, moviegoers thronged to it, now the Academy should give it and its actors the awards it deserves.
835;the twists and turns of this movie lead to many surprises and revelations.
836;I thought it had a good mix of romance, action, and comedy.
837;The action scenes are well.
838;With Spiderman 2 , Director Sam Raimi delivers that rarest of beasts: an action/adventure movie with real emotional depth.
839;Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself at odds with his super hero powers.
840;time love, MJ (Kirsten Dunst) is on the brink of cutting him out of her life.
841;brilliant scientist Dr. Octavius turned Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) .
842;from the stunning graphic art sequence of the opening credits to the final scene, Spiderman 2 is a visually impressive film, even more so than the first.
843;if you liked the first Spiderman , you'll like this one even more.
844;This is certainly one of the best superhero films to have appeared in a long time, and there's no doubting the feel.
845;good fun this sequel commands.
846;The director manages to make every scene count, and the surprises never stop.
847;slinging vigilante who wages with his identity and the life he wishes to lead.
848;SpiderMan 2 returns in its comic pulp fantasy glory and is even more focused in its portrayal of the superhero with his frailities and dilemma and reconciling with the fact that with great power comes great responsibility.
849;Director Sam Raimi, with his unwavering passion, has beautifully spun a maginificent tribute to the beloved superhero crafted by Marvel whiz Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in this moving spectacle.
850;i gave this film 5 stars because I enjoyed the film.
851;now to the heart of this post.
852;I like directors commentary, plenty of special features.
853;for me this is a simple solution .
854;and IF they are really anything worth while.4.
855;If it is worth the effort/money.
856;I will remain with the version I have.
857;Great action flick with a decent love story.
858;Liked it even more than the first one, and that one was very good.
859;If there is to be a Spiderman 3, it will have to be spectacular.
860;One of the best of its genre.
861;Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, maintains his identity as Spider.
862;The love of his life Mary Jane Watson is engaged to be married to the son of his employer.
863;His best friend Frank Osborn is seeking revenge against Spider.
864;He turns a nice and romantic scientist into a criminal and can't undo the damage.
865;the second was just as good as the first.
866;man and the second gives us an incite of what a superhero is mentally and physically.
867;I liked the first one and the second one here is Good .
868;not great or Spectacular but just good .
869;It was funny at first seing Peter Parker get dumped on by everybody in his life:1.
870;Excellent special efx and State of the art CGI efx.
871;Fighting on the side of a skyscaper was exciting to watch.
872;His goal was to continue his experiment to.
873;With his new great strength and powers he didn't really put it to much advantage.
874;Doc Ock was really likable even when he turned bad.you kind of felt sorry for him.
875;his doctor (that I have a friend who dreams he's spiderman. )
876;man movie back in the spring of 2002 and it is still a very good movie.
877;It was worth the wait and left a great deal to be desired.
878;"So how was it that they were going to follow up on a really good original especially amidst the improvement that X2 did upon ""X. men""."
879;"Well my verdict on this is that ""Spider Man 2"" is a grand improvement over the first one, is light years better, and greatly expands Spider Man's character in the movie series and the result is without a doubt one of the greatest sequels that I've ever seen!"
880;Be mindful that this review may contain some spoilers to this movie but I'll do my best to minimize them.
881;two years after the fiasco with Norman Osborn, Peter Parker starts to enter into uncharted territory in his life.
882;Amidst the changes he's going through, things gradually deteriorate as his personal and professional life begins to come apart at the seams.
883;During a special demonstration at a laboratory, Octavius heads a promising project that utilizes a stable form of fusion power.
884;His grades begin to rapidly improve, and Peter is on his way to rebuilding his self.
885;He even begins to win back Mary Jane's affection as well despite the fiasco from earlier in the film.
886;He seems to have finally gotten firm ground in his life.
887;"this sequel to the first ""Spider Man"" movie completely took my world by storm even with sky high expectations."
888;Almost everything about this movie is nothing short of brilliant.
889;The major action fighting sequences between Spidey and Dock Ock are among the greatest battle scenes that I've seen in years.
890;what especially carries this wonderful movie are the characters as well as the special effects.
891;The special effects are really breathtaking and awesome.
892;Pretty much everything that is more than 30 feet away are almost all CGI effects and they are highly realistic.
893;The movie also expands the characters immensely.
894;My favorite one was delving far deeper into Peter Parker's past.
895;As I said in the review for the first Spider Man film, Toby Maguire was absolutely perfect for the role of the former geek student Peter Parker transformed into a superhero.
896;opening surprises and some emotional moments are brought forth.
897;Dock Ock is one of my favorite super villains in the comic series and that he would be the villain in this movie thrilled me very much.
898;Well Molina is absolutely amazing and unbelievably perfect for the role of playing a brilliant benevolent scientist later twisted by grief and rage into a deranged shell of his former self.
899;Perhaps I'm just a mad science nerd but the whole concept of fusion is fascinating and one of my favorite science subjects.
900;I have never seen a comic book movie work so well on improving on the greatness of it's predecessor.
901;It is brilliant, it is highly emotional and nothing short of stunning and breathtaking!
902;"To put it this way, this is perhaps my favorite sequel of any sorts since 1986's ""Aliens"" which also improved on its scary 1979 predecessor ""Alien""."
903;i strongly recommend that you get this movie as soon as possible.
904;"If there is a true ""Amazing Spider Man"" movie, this is it!"
905;It's nice that older people can enjoy this one as well.
906;this was an excellent movie taking place a little while after the first one ended.
907;Very interesting, kids don't get any of that of course.
908;Very enjoyable and fun movie, looking to be the best superhero series ever made.
909;this movie is an exceptional story.
910;Like its predecessor, it remains true to the spirit of the comics thanks to the direction of Sam Rami.
911;man losing his powers because of self doubt and discomfort with his role in life as it was never an angle explored in the comic, but it was a great plot device to explore the dual life of Peter Parker.
912;Alfred Molina was a truly excellent choice for Dr. Octupus.
913;His performance as the brilliant scientist and loving husband turned eight limbed super villain is first rate.
914;man and Doc Ock easily eclipsed those between Spider.
915;Raimi and the writers of the film developed some truly creative ways for both the hero and the villain to employ their powers.
916;The FX department did a wonderful job bringing the action to life and making Doc Ock move as one would expect.
917;i highly recommend this film.
918;man and comic book fans will enjoy it for its true to spirit adaptation of the comic (although not 100% faithful to the comic book).
919;Next to 'X. men 2,' it is one of the best translations ever.
920;Action fans are in for a treat as well.
921;The movie excellently blends action, story, character development, and humor.
922;I highly recommend this film.
923;The first half of this movie is the best half.
924;stop action sequences there is a lot of humor and much richer character development stemming from the first film.
925;However, I still think Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst look more like kissin' cousins than potential lovers, but they are obviously friends and the chemistry is good.
926;The dialogue in the first half of the movie is sharp and witty and fun.
927;I heard them all in the first film and I heard it three times in this second film.
928;"man 2"" has way too many flat spots, particularly in the second half of the film, to make it an engrossing experience."
929;Sam Raimi is one of the best directors out there .
930;but in Mr. Raimi's hands, this movie is intelligent, the story consistent and the action incredibly original.
931;I loved the first Spider.
932;And Alfred Molina gives a beautiful acting turn as Dr. Octopus .
933;mouse with the two character could have been involving and dramatically important.
934;There were actually a couple of small spots in Spider.
935;adventure elements still work great.
936;man's fight with Doc Ock on top of a clock tower is spectacular, the finale is suitably engaging and action.
937;packed, and the centerpiece of the movie .
938;is a real adrenalin pumper, with an unexpectedly moving end to the scene.
939;man film (the New York camaraderie) was expounded on, improved, and made more resonant.
940;Just this scene alone is worth the four stars I give to this film.
941;the outlook is good for the next Spider.
942;If they can complicate the issues Peter Parker and Mary Jane face and take some more risks with the relationship, then it probably *will* be one of the best superhero films of all time.
943;I got the extended edition of Daredevil and the extra footage made more sense on some of the rest of the storyline that tended to just stay open.
944;spiderman 2 was a great movie, the extra few minutes just added to the depth of the movie, worth the money for me at least.
945;Not a very good movie.
946;It is no way as good as the first one.
947;my lady movie critic and I give i two thumbs down.
948;While watching it, I truely felt like I had been transported right into a comic book.
949;They did an incredible job of keeping the essential elements of comics in the movie and portraying them right.
950;In the movie, just like the comic, the most important character is the elusive girl.
951;While Spiderman 2 is an action packed super hero flick, you could equally argue that it's a love story.
952;He has to balance his lifestyle of being both a normal newspaper photographer and a crimefighting superhero.
953;He struggles to keep his identity secret and struggles to deal with demons from his past.
954;All those elements of conflict are in the movie and they keep you on the edge of your seat and biting your fingernails.
955;I loved watching how the characters have evolved in between the two films.
956;The film is just like a comic book in the sense that the characters are always evolving and issues from the past always have effects on the future.
957;the action sequences were incredible.
958;The computer generated graphics looked amazingly real.
959;I liked how they created the conflict between Spiderman and Doc Ock.
960;I loved seeing Spiderman struggling to handle the eight armed Doctor Ock.
961;the movie also has several comedic moments.
962;Go out there and enjoy the movie for yourself.
963;It's nice to watch a sequel done right.
964;was for my nephew and he loves it.
965;Spiderman 2 is the best movie this summer.
966;the special effects are amazing.
967;Tobey Maguire is fantastic as Spiderman.
968;Kirsten Dunst is great as his romantic interest.
969;The director really shows you how great Spiderman is, but when he goes back to being Peter Parker his whole life becomes a mess.
970;in addition to the special effects and romance in the movie, there are also may comedic scenes.
971;Very funny scenes showing you how helpless Peter is.
972;woven into Spiderman makes the movie even more enjoyable.
973;see it for the Special Effects, the Romance, the Comedy .
974;its a great summer movie !
975;"for instance, in the movie ""reality"" Spidey has organic webbing created by his body."
976;This NATURALLY created a very cool predicament, as sometimes Spidey runs out of web fluid at some of the most inopportune times.
977;One of the common prevailing themes of Spider.
978;another issue I have is a minor one, but one that bothers me nonetheless.
979;"The PROBLEM with this line of the story is that it is BOGUS and in my mind DOES NOT illustrate the common theme of ""with great power comes great responsibility""."
980;okay, let me first say that I have nothing against Kirsten Dunsts and I also believe that she is a fantastic actress who did the very best that she possibly could in this role.
981;She was an absolute hotty, gorgeous, cocky and just a little bit slutty.
982;one of the most fabulous things about the comic book is that Peter Parker is kind of a tool!
983;HOWEVER, when he dons the Spidey costume, he is transformed into a cocky, sometimes even arrogant superhero who ALWAYS has a funny comment, which serves both to entertain the reader and to throw off his opponent's concentration.
984;"Meaning that I am rating the movie in terms of pure story, action, acting, special effects and the ""feeling"" of it."
985;On that basis, the movie is absolutely fantastic.
986;necessary bastardization of the characters and the whole Spider.
987;so, that said, the reason the movie gets 5 stars is as follows:The acting is top notch, superb!
988;The directing is also top notch and the special effects are startlingly realistic.
989;I really felt Spidey swinging from building to building, and the fight scenes between Spider.
990;"the story was engrossing and riveting and you really felt a profound empathy with the plight of a teenager given superpowers and the trainwreck that his life turns into because of this so called ""gift""."
991;That much the movies REALLY captured very well from the comic books, and even made it seem more real on the screen.
992;They went from very funny to heart.
993;wrenchingly touching without missing a beat.
994;The action was heart pounding and had me literally on the edge of my seat.
995;Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better.
996;It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy.
997;besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie.
998;Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.
999;man movie a masterpiece did it not possess numerous boneheaded gaffs.
1000;In order to do this, he's told to question Peter Parker.
1001;heart talk, throws a car through the front window.
1002;"cross imagery is not lost on me
1003;screen in the first movie, Maguire totally inhabited this character, he's utterly believable as the achingly decent, slightly geeky young hero with an overdeveloped sense of responsibility.
1004;On the other hand, Rosemary Harris makes a wonderful Aunt May"
1005;"J. k. Simmons is absolutely perfect as J. Jonah Jameson
1006;Alfred Molina, a fine actor, as Doctor Octopus looks like the comic book character come to life, and his tentacles are believable.
1007;which is a good thing because it gives you less time to think about its many glaring logic flaws.
1008;2004 was a year that actually saw the advent of several top notch motion pictures (""""the Incredibles"""" comes to mind)."""
1009;honestly, I suspected that this would at least be a worthy successor to the dynamic original.
1010;The action sequences are jaw dropping due to clever staging and some of the best f/x work ever to grace the screen (that sequence on the subway is the best action scene ever) and the performances (particularly Alfred Molina as the diabolical Doc Ock and Tobey Maguire as the conflicted Peter) are nothing short of astounding.
1011;the human relationships are given mopre depth and resonance this time around, and because we grow to genuinely care about this amazing young man who has been endowed with both a gift and a curse, the events in the film matter.
1012;Spiderman 2 is ingenious in that it realizes by having us really like and care about Peter and the people in his life, it means that much more when he triumphs, both in battle and on a personal level.
1013;the other aspect that raises this film above all others of its genre is that Raimi wisely used the trademark imagery that marked his indie work.
1014;It is one of many subtle touches Raimi adds to the mix to remind his fans that, yes, this is the same director we know and love.
1015;"the best way to summarize this film is as follows: If you did not like ""Spiderman 2"", I recommend that you stop watching comic book films."
1016;if theres even a modicum of honesty left in the Academy , this film will take top honors at the oscars.
1017;On all levels, both technical and in terms of plot and performance, it deserves it.
1018;This was indeed the movie of the year, and is a stunning example fo how to do it right.
1019;He has a special talent which makes his life miserable and you can read it in his expressions when things go wrong.
1020;I thought it entertaining, especially for the children I bought it for.
1021;My grand kids enjoyed it very much.
1022;submitted by a loving Grandma.
1023;man 2 a wonderful entertainment for kids and adults alike.
1024;Will Peter turn his back forever on the forces of evil, or will he sacrifice his dreams in order to help mankind?Alvin Sargent has written a very funny and touching script with just the right blend of action and emotion.
1025;Sam Raimi directs with flair, and he gets fine performances from the young leads as well as from such veteran actors as Rosemary Harris, who plays Peter's Aunt May, and J. k. Simmons, who portrays Peter's unfeeling boss.
1026;paced, witty, and even a bit poignant at times.
1027;Most of all, it's loads of fun.
1028;"When he called Spidey 2 the ""Greatest Superhero movie,"" he was right on the nose."
1029;It's got the emotional impact the story needs, it's got a very well cast Doc Ock, and, of course, it's got Bruce Campbell.
1030;He's only in one scene, but when he appeared, I stood up and cheered in the theater.
1031;the movie isn't perfect, mind you.
1032;I know a great many people like that.
1033;I liked the plot pretty well and at times thought it could be a good movie.
1034;I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
1035;this was a SPECTACULAR film both artistically and technically.
1036;Spider Man has always been a favorite character that has been well handled in both films but definitely better in the second movie.
1037;All the actors were great and quite well casted.
1038;a special note to Alfred Molina .
1039;if ever a comic book movie could win an Oscar for a performance this is it!
1040;He has got my Oscar vote.
1041;it is interesting to note that both Dr. Ock and Peter Parker (both men of science) are dealing with the same kind of life crises (loss of loved ones, radical physical changes and new powers, seeking their purpose in life, etc)Just one little issue that came to me about the plot.
1042;It some scenes superhuman Spidey makes some really good punches connect.
1043;Dr. Ock is a genius with mechanical super strength and speed which makes him dangerous but still a basic man behind the arms.
1044;Just a little detail, but an important note for Dr. Ock's eventual return.
1045;finally, it is great that both movies seem to show that the real hero of the show is indeed Peter Parker .
1046;It is also good to see those sacrifices being touchingly respected and reciprocate when both Peter and Spider Man are completely vulnerable as in the train scene and at the end of the show with Mary Jane's actions.
1047;Makes you just want to cheer.
1048;Best movie ever, even better then the first one.
1049;The movie really shows Spiderman's internal struggles, how it's not always so great to be a hero.
1050;You see Spiderman as this everyday person who does these great things because he chooses too, not because he has too.
1051;some of the dialogue is very clever and funny, and the train scene was suspenseful and well done.
1052;spderman deserves better than this, maybe next time.
1053;I used to read and enjoy comic books when I was a young boy.
1054;What a pleasant surprise to see such a fascinating adaptation of the comic book into a well made movie on the superhero, Spider.
1055;This is an excellent movie, well produced with fantastic special effects and an interesting story.
1056;He has superhuman strengths and agility as well as powers to sense approaching danger.
1057;He is a kind and selfless person.
1058;His nemesis is the rich CEO who plays as the cruel and devilish Green Goblin (perfectly played by Willem Dafoe).
1059;The pretty Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane Watson) who is Parker's sweetheart also plays her role exceptionally well.
1060;an enjoyable, fun and action packed movie with good acting all round that is well worth watching.
1061;An avid comic follower for years, this truly made me want to cringe.
1062;franchise featuring the everyman's superhero, Peter Parker/Spider Man, played perfectly by the versatile Tobey Maguire.
1063;pounding, involving story complete with a few tear.
1064;this is an intelligent, touching, and wonderfully.
1065;"I loved the way director Sam Raimi takes the trademark quote from the original, ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and weaves it in as the very soul of this film."
1066;"With such a powerful core, ""Spider."
1067;man, connecting him beautifully to the audience and really drawing us into his psyche.
1068;"man 2"" won't just awe and excite you
1069;I would not recommend this version as the best looking version.
1070;I just got back from seeing """"Spider."""
1071;I have to say that it definitely blows away the first film although the first film was wonderful.
1072;Eventually Peter succumbs to his doubts as a superhero and whether the sacrifice is worth it.
1073;That in itself was well written out and the writers did an excellent job at fleshing out the true essence of the comic book Peter Parker and bringing him out in actor Tobey McGuire however director Sam Raimi gets full credit for keeping faithful to who the characters are from the comic book pages to the big screen.
1074;Alfred's portrayal as the brilliant physicist turned psychopath was one of the best performances I have seen from Alfred.
1075;That entire scene in general was rather intense and brutal to say the very least.
1076;"The special effects were amazing although there were moments that just screamed ""I am the cheese"" because I could easily tell that they were computer generated."
1077;It is rare to see a comic book turned into a movie that is so well written.
1078;"Sam Raimi stayed true to the essence of the ""Spider."
1079;He's back, and he's better than ever.
1080;man (Tobey Maguire), liked his super.
1081;powers, and enjoyed being a superhero.
1082;i was an enormous fan of SPIDER.

1085;mAN and THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) will please fans with her kind personality, and true love for Peter Parker.
1086;mAN 2 just as good, as if not better than it's predecessor.
1087;man 2 was a great film the way it was!While Spider.
1088;overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless.
1089;Worth the money but I'd find it at a lower price than what's there right now.
1090;Great art and great stories!!
1091;man 2"""" is more emotionally charged and the very human conflicts add a sense of realism to a technically over."""
1092;toby Maguire's charming portrayal of Peter Parker is great here.
1093;His physical appearance is also a stand.
1094;Emotionally, the film works well because the 2 main characters are likeable enough to make us care for them and their emotional plights.
1095;ock comes across as rather sympathetic during the final segment.
1096;A genius who's creation and megalomania overcame him.
1097;top and some scenes are unbelievable at best.
1098;But hey, this is based on a comic book.
1099;And when all is executed so cleverly, who the heck cares?
1100;It's a thrilling tale of an all too human super.
1101;very good movie i liked it a lot.
1102;I've never been a huge Spiderman fan, but I did enjoy the first movie.
1103;The second time around I did still enjoy the movie but it did not seem to be as good as the first.
1104;His life somehow becomes perfect right when he gives up being a superhero.
1105;It's all just silly humor.
1106;There are good moments too.
1107;For one, the special effects are great, not that I expected them to be anything otherwise.
1108;ish at times but still solid.
1109;There is a nifty train sequence and an even better climatic battle at the end that the first movie.
1110;He is way over the top cartoon.
1111;But regardless, it's still a decent popcorn movie that most people will enjoy.
1112;In Spiderman 2, Peter Parker, ahem Spiderman, decides to give it up.
1113;It is an action movie, with plenty of suspenseful scenes and CGI effects, but it doesn't overdo them ad nausea to the point where it is being shoved down your throat.
1114;It is a comic book movie with heart and IQ.
1115;Is there a happy medium?Another plus is the cast.
1116;Toby McGuire does a superb job again (for the 2nd time) as Peter Parker.
1117;This is good, though, because it really makes the story more real and doesn't dumb down the film to just a special effects show.
1118;Spiderman, we find out, is more human than meets the eye.
1119;in the two disc set, disc one has a section of commentary with director Sam Raimi, as well as some of the cast, and a blooper reel.
1120;Disc two has a documentary about the making of the film, along with a documentary about the history of the villain, Doc Ock.
1121;Tobey does an excellent job as both peter parker and spider man.
1122;this second movie of the series introduces a new character doctor octopus who's mechanical arms seem to each have a unique personality of their own.
1123;man the writing is very good, with strong characters(except for Dunst) that fans actually care about.
1124;The special edition is worth it.
1125;The post cards are really amazing looking keepsakes and the comic book is also really neat.
1126;The comic book is better than the one that Wal.
1127;Superior sequel that deals with its themes effectively while striking the right balance between action and dramatic scenes .
1128;moreover, a more sensitive adaptation of the Spider.
1129;This combination of realism and fantasy is compelling.
1130;is risible, but dramatically effective.
1131;a subtle analysis of the myth of the super hero from the point of view of a super coward.
1132;taking that one becomes truly effective .
1133;the performance of J K SIMMONS as J Jonah Jameson is a comic standout in a film replete with running gags and in.
1134;"This is a superb love story about identity and the fear that revealing the truth about one's true self will result in the loss of that love
1135;Tobey Maguire sizzles on and achieves several things besides an outstanding characterization of Our Hero.
1136;We get that rarity, a GOOD sequel, and still rarer, one that surpasses the original.
1137;fi, if there is nothing cheesy in the movie, it's not sci fi, i love this movie.
1138;Peter Parker proves all too well that he has a lot of human DNA mixed in with his spider powers.
1139;This is an excellent plot line that shows us the fraility of humans and our desire to be someone we're not.
1140;I will give a little on that front, even though I believe that most movies with a hero grappling with world.
1141;my main beef with all superhero flicks is this: A strength of the hero in one instance will be forgotten or overcome a few minutes or scenes later into the movie.
1142;I see that a superhero can perform a certain feat, and remember it!For an example, I'll use Superman 2.
1143;He can disappear and reappear in three or four places, and he can """"zap"""" with his hand."""
1144;At first glance, this might seem to be an entertaining and suspenseful action flick, complete with big name Hollywood stars, fantastic special effects, and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1145;I liked Dr. octopus alright.
1146;He's kinda charming, and comes off a lot better then you'd imagine, on film.
1147;And while the surprisingly few action sequences are usually pretty good, they faulter at times.
1148;And, it pushes believability way past the breaking point, a remarkable feat for a frickin superhero movie.
1149;overall, this movie is passably entertaining and all, but I'm easily amused.
1150;There are lotsa films out there that I dislike that critics love, but I can usually understand their reasoning.
1151;dramatic quasi love story equalled genius.
1152;Hopefully, he'll start making good movies again, someday.
1153;This is the best Spiderman movie yet!
1154;The plot is better and the characters are awesome!
1155;If you haven't seen this movie, see it today!
1156;I thought this one was much better!
1157;This is an awesome movie.
1158;It is better than the first one.
1159;This is an awesome movie.
1160;There are so many people who laud this as the best comic book movie ever.
1161;man in order to find love and a life.
1162;The opening of the movie leading up to the central part of the story work quite well and I applaud the writing.
1163;man, and Peter Parker's angst all come across realistically and draw the audience in.
1164;overall this was a fun movie.
1165;The best comic book movie, not quite.
1166;The action sequences are awesome, Doc Oc is incredible.
1167;The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1168;Wonderful performances from the actors put this film into Superhero movie heaven.
1169;the effects are very good.
1170;the story and inner stories are good.
1171;finally I feel to many people learn who he is at the end.
1172;and a hero's wedding perhappes??
1173;The general cast well .
1174;lets hope they stay on board for round 3.
1175;Much the same way that Star Wars relegated most science fiction movies to B reels, so has the Spiderman franchise done to comic book hero movies.
1176;It starts with one of the best young actors of his generation, Tobey Maguire, He has a fantastic ability to delve into the most human aspects of a character, and Spiderman is no exception to his resume.
1177;He creates a sympathetic and identifiable character, who only appears to be a superhero in the most extreme action sequences, yet otherwise, comes across as just another man thrown into an amazing situation.
1178;Alfred Molina, as Doc Ock, delivers a magnificent performance, bringing to the screen a villian that one can not help but feel sympathetic for.
1179;This is another great movie based on the marvel comics.
1180;The action in this movie is great.
1181;There are some pretty funny parts, too.
1182;For example, he does something and kids nearby asked how he did it.
1183;man 1, this movie is deffinately perfect for you.
1184;In my opinion, I liked it about 2 times better than the first.
1185;She's a Spiderman fan and has been for over a year now.
1186;Thank you for the fast delivery to her and she is very pleased once again.
1187;Picture is more vivid,sound is great, most of the neat extras are carriedover plus you get theatrical and extended cuts of thefilm.
1188;I recommend this good blu.
1189;Great direction and action went into to this film, but i can't say the same about its story.
1190;This movie is a masterpiece.
1191;It has a broad reach, genuine complexity in the emotional lives of the characters and a compelling storyline.
1192;I used to read Marvel comics all the time when I was a kid and this film captures those more fully than anything else in this genre.
1193;The elevated subway ride is the best use of a subway in a movie since The Matrix and is just breathtaking.
1194;At the same time the movie is very well paced, razzle dazzle action sequences are mixed up with quiet moments of tenderness.
1195;I also really enjoyed the humor scattered through the movie.
1196;For everyone who loves this comic genre, I'd say this is the movie where they got it right.
1197;For people who don't, you will enjoy it anyway.
1198;Not only does it move ahead with the story, but the action/romance scenes.
1199;Nice opening credits sequence, which is enough to orient those who haven't seen the first movie.
1200;There are also plenty of allusions to the first movie as well.
1201;"The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for ""Spider."
1202;Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles.
1203;"Hope the third one exceeds expectations and brings the saga to a close, although making more wouldn't be a bad idea
1204;Mr. Alfred Molina, who I will always remember as Satipo in """"Raiders of the Lost Ark"""" does an excellent job in this film."""
1205;Along with Mr. Tobey Maguire, another great actor, and good news he's signed on for seven films?
1206;"Another credit goes to Mr. Sam Raimi who made the ""Spider."
1207;I remember hearing he had a Spider.
1208;Miss Kirsten Dunst does a spectacular job of playing Mary Jane Watson in this movie.
1209;I saw it and was in awe, it was a terrific film.
1210;Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson have cameoes, reprising their roles as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin and Uncle Ben Parker.
1211;"I love this film, best film of 2004, along with ""Troy""."
1212;I'd recommend, better than the original, but see the original first, anyway.
1213;Sam Raimi has a great feeling for Spidey and Tobey McGuire does a pretty convincing job of pulling him off.
1214;After the blockbusting success of SPIDER.
1215;Picking up two years from the events of the original film, Parker finds himself struggling to balance both his personal and super.
1216;hero lives without much success.
1217;breaking of all, he alienates himself from everyone, especially the girl he loves, by seemingly never being anywhere on time.
1218;(The fact that he?s late due to the need for his super heroic services doesn?t help matters.)
1219;just as before, Sam Raimi directs the whole thing with a keen and sure hand.
1220;In fact, he seems to display more confidence as he effortlessly blends the film?s small and personable moments with the top notch CGI action scenes.
1221;Indeed, the entire cast seems more assured.
1222;Tobey Maguire again proves that he was born to play the title role with his doe.
1223;eyed Peter Parker tugging at our heartstrings, even as we cheer his super heroics.
1224;Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane, the girl he secretly loves.
1225;J. k. Simmons again hams it up delightfully as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter?s bombastic newspaper boss.
1226;It definitely is an improvement on the bombastic Green Goblin of the first film.
1227;It?s character and heart matches the large scale action to make a superhero film that is rarely seen these days.
1228;up to the first film and a movie that gets one of my highest recommendations.
1229;man, which was full of action, adventure, and intrigue, Spider.
1230;It's closer to a G.
1231;That, of course, made the entire middle of the film nice to take a nap to.
1232;I actually laughed at that part.
1233;Very powerful themes of guilt, love,and responsibility wrapped in some great action.
1234;This movie outshines its brilliant predecessor by a mile with better fight scenes, a great plot, and some good laughs.
1235;That's a lot of stuff that our superhero's got to deal with.
1236;The movie has a fair share of luaghs, some awesome and memorable fights and good acting by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfed Molina.
1237;If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it.
1238;it's just done really, really well.
1239;To tell you the truth, I am not a comic book fan, but yet I am familiar with some comic book heroes, and Spiderman is on the top of the list.
1240;First off, the story is great, the concept of good versus evil, a true love story, and a struggling young man trying to take responsiblility for many things in his life, and many people could relate to Peter Parker.
1241;Second, Peter Parker is transformed into an incredible super hero that saves the city from petty crimes to evil villians trying to destroy everything.
1242;Third, the visual effects are unbelievable.
1243;overall, this is the best comic book movie franchise out there right now and it will be hard to top it.
1244;Looking forward to Spiderman 3, heard many things about it, for example the number of villans that will appear in the movie!
1245;The return of Tobey Maguire with Spiderman 2 is thrill to watch on a big screen keeping high on adrenaline as well as emotions as the web slinger makes sure that justice must triump over vindictiveness.
1246;By inventing a nerdy Peter Parker and giving him a secret life as angst.
1247;ridden super hero, Lee brought new sophisticational and emotional depth to what had been considered a child's genre.
1248;this movie has a heart and technical artistry alongwith the subtle allusions to the 9/11 devastation, the imaginative set designs, the astounding computer generated stunts and crackerjack tempo that keeps one engrossed.
1249;The young new yorker Toby maguire may possess incredible powers but still can't declare his feelings to the love (kirsten Dunst) of his life.
1250;Save the city and somehow win the girl's heart form the double agenda of the always do.
1251;A great movie to watch with the screen story co. written by the celebrated novelist Michael Chabon.
1252;But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement, pathos and humor.
1253;Granted, it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were.
1254;The earthquakes signalling his approach are very cool.
1255;the sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set.
1256;In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman.
1257;A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before.
1258;But for once the box office receipts are validated by a good movie.
1259;look out for some funny in.
1260;Spiderman 2 actually surprised me, in that I truly did enjoy it.
1261;or continue his life of responsibility as Spiderman.
1262;He's also fighting with knowing that he killed Harry's father, and Harry desperately wants revenge against him, not knowing of course that he's Spiderman.
1263;i never would have thought an action movie like this could intertwine such a good plot, but Spiderman 2 does it pretty well.
1264;It all comes together pretty well at the end, and of course, the option of another installment of Spiderman is left open.
1265;If you're missing the true action movies that are missing any sort of plot, then you'll probably enjoy this one too.
1266;that is, with the way that absolutely nothing seemed to go right for Peter Parker.
1267;in the final action scene, Spiderman holds up a side of a building or some kind of wall.
1268;Oh yes, the price was good.
1269;Peter Parker is becoming exuasted, saving the citizens of New York has finally taken its toll on the Web.
1270;With the knowledge of Mary Jane moving on in her life professionally and in the aspects of being in love with the Web.
1271;This tremendously clouds Parker's sense in being able to see two new rivals rise.
1272;One is an idol in Spidey's interest in science, and the other is an old friend who is reeling from the fact that Spider.
1273;"once again, the talented Sam Rami directs this film
1274;He also remains true to the characters and the comics' storylines.

1276;mAN 3:Spidey is up against one of his greatest foes"
1277;Still, it's worth watching, and the special effects associated with the Doctor Octopus character are super.
1278;man 2 was this summer's best film and one of the best this year.
1279;Doc Ock is the best villain I've ever seen in a comic.
1280;I liked the first movie.
1281;It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying.
1282;the one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable .
1283;This movie was very good.
1284;I saw it July 3rd, and loved it.
1285;it was funnier and more creative.
1286;Great movie, Go See It!
1287;publicized film, and take it as it is.
1288;In other words: was the movie well.
1289;"crafted, emotionally fulfilling
1290;it's a tale of psychological depth and meaning.
1291;It's a movie of unique direction: well.
1292;crafted in its scenes and symbolism.
1293;Yet it balances these elements with the type of nuanced timing that keeps them from seeming disjunct or becoming thrematically fatiguing.
1294;In the same way the actors are seamlessly joined together by great chemistry, making the characters seem alive. . . A very, very well done film.
1295;Then when you consider it's a movie based on a stereotypical comic book character: it's excellent.
1296;So the film adds a good layer of sentimental events and feelings.
1297;She is afraid and fascinated.
1298;She is jealous and possessive.
1299;She is maybe adult and open.
1300;That kind of stuff gives to the film some interesting dimension.
1301;This whole dimension of a normal guy, a normal boy capable of normal feelings and cowardice is exploited here to reveal the other super.
1302;But it is full of emotional pulpy strength.
1303;The first was great but this one is even better.
1304;The comic humor is brilliant especially with J. Jonah Jameson getting ticked off all the time with Spider.
1305;The special effects are great and not overdone and they look very realisic especially the fusion reaction that occurs when the machine is activated.
1306;while not necessarily the greatest sequel of all time (That honor belongs to """"The Godfather Part II, and """"Terminator 2"""") this is nonetheless one of the greatest sequels ever and I strongly recommend seeing it today."""
1307;The comebacks are finally getting decent.
1308;A nice second to Spider One.
1309;Spiderman has always been a great comic.
1310;Not because Spiderman was the most powerful superhero, but because he was one of the most human characters.
1311;All because being Spiderman is a full.
1312;time and often thankless job.
1313;So, he is faced with the possibility of making his life easier by leaving his crime.
1314;and then there is the Spiderman side of this wonderful story.
1315;Spiderman has a new enemy by a scientist turned mad.
1316;This movie is unforgettable and nearly unmatchable.
1317;While I feel the Spiderman films of today are strictly for the teenagers, I am a Spiderman fan from way back.
1318;"The comic books of the 1970's, the cartoons and ""The Amazing Spider."
1319;Spiderman still holds my interest.
1320;now they got Spiderman delivering pizzas.
1321;the film is more enjoyable if you fast.
1322;If you see the Spiderman sense, press Enter.
1323;I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around.
1324;Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new.
1325;Far from being a cookie cutter movie, Spiderman 2 offers a lot that will definitely keep it as one of the most live action movies that will probably have more hot and exciting sequels.
1326;The two motivating factors that I found intriguing and what gives a debate around the plot of the movie is the use of nannotechnology or in this case 'nannowires' and fusion technology that makes scenes and storylines appears more of a reality than a fiction.
1327;In fact a world driven by nannotechnology will reflect the depth and nature of the problems we have today.
1328;such as an ever growing population crises exarcabeted with recent events such as the recent Asian tsunami crises and perhaps growing regional instablility along with subsequent massive wars.
1329;That is all I have to say after viewing this movie.
1330;It's the perfect blend between action, drama, romance and comedy.

1335;Wow, what an amazing film!
1336;Sam Raimi has really outdone himself with Spider.
1337;Like any true artist, he has improved upon his craft with time and experience and it really shines through in the movie.
1338;Every element that could feasibly be improved upon from the last outing has.
1339;on performances and really help to enhance the emotional aspect of the story.
1340;The action sequences occur much more freqeuenly, are more elaborate and quite frankly, beautiful to look at.
1341;hard fans, the film continues to remain faithful to the comics in the continual unraveling of Peter Parker's life.
1342;But what I enjoyed most about this comic.
1343;film adaptation is that underneath the flashy action scenes and the over.
1344;hero/arch villian rivalry is that at its core, the film retains a beating heart and a moral foundation that has all but disentigrated when it comes to how most other super.
1345;heroes and their motives are conveyed.
1346;man 2 an eclectic blend of action, comedy, romance, and morality that is completely worthy of your time and money.
1347;It appeals to all and deserves its widespread praise.
1348;It's got great riffs, great heros, great action, and a great story.
1349;You'll dig the flick and it's worth the price to see it on the big screen and dig the action on the big spreen.
1350;The subway scene was my favorite action.
1351;a big motif is how Spiderman is revealed to many throughout the movie.
1352;Peter's got to wrestle with how to share his double identity with those closest to him so that the sacrifices of his double life don't paralyze him from utilizing his superpowers.
1353;Many have commented on how character focus is a big strength of the movie, and I'll definitely agree on that point.
1354;i recommend you see this flick, because it's probably going to be the best action flick of the summer, and it will hold up better on the big screen than on video.
1355;"But on the whole it's a film to like and enjoy, and it's not the classic for me that ""Matrix"" is."
1356;They were powerful, morally upright, and unwaivering in their convictions.
1357;In other words, it was fun to follow their adventures, but they were a bit hard to relate to.
1358;As far as capturing the true essence of it's title character, this movie tops them all.
1359;in a lot of ways, this is THE Spider.
1360;"it's been beaten to death a bit by now, but it all boils down to what Uncle Ben told Peter: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""
1361;Should he live for himself, enjoy his life, and ignore the powers he's been given?
1362;This is the conflict that is at the very core of this character, and this movie captured that in ways that I'm sure made Stan Lee proud.
1363;it just so happens that this particular young man has some extraordinary powers.
1364;"don't get me wrong
1365;Doctor Octopus is a visually dynamic (as well as tragic) villain, and he makes for a lot of exciting scenes.
1366;Spectacular!But at heart, this is a movie about character development.
1367;He did an amazing job, mixing drama, action, humor, and just a dash of Evil Dead.

1372;This story is a great addition to the movie genre and Spiderman folklore alike.
1373;the thing I like most about this movie is that it follows the TRUE story line of the comic.
1374;In my opinion, this is why it is so successful.
1375;This robs the original plot and details and takes away the thing that has made the story great.
1376;It was good, and that is why it is still around today.
1377;And this movie does a great job of keeping that story alive.

1381;Of course, growing up I was a huge Spiderman comic book fan, even through the clone comics.
1382;But the first one lacked something that these other two comic books had, not sure what it was but it just wasn't there, but I still loved it, and I had been waiting a long time to see it brought to the screen, and still surpassed my expectations.
1383;This went beyond my expectations, everything was brought to a whole new level.

1386;His inner conflict is both personal yet epic, he becomes a new mythological character for modern America.
1387;He, and Superman, and Batman (and to a lesser extent the Hulk and the X. men), are our Hercules and Achilles and Gilgamesh.
1388;this movie hits the right note on so many levels, I almost fear the 3rd movie.
1389;Enjoy this one, because it's about as good as a superhero/action film as you will ever see.
1390;this movie has completely restored my faith in hero/comic films.
1391;Granted, many of the Marvel films of late have been pretty good, but this one by far exemplifies the best of Marvel, the best of Spiderman.
1392;It is now my favorite superhero film ever, outdoing both Xmen and the original Tobey Spiderman.
1393;it is a synthesis of good acting, good sets, good CGI, good cinematography, good direction, perfect timing, and blends both light hearted sense of humor with seriousness and as well as both dreams and daily life.
1394;His story as a driven scientist and the sudden and violent demise of his career and spouse makes this character much more human and real.
1395;The tentacle effects are great.
1396;what keeps me from falling truly in love with the franchise, and most comic book franchises, are the super heroes themselves, in this case Spider.
1397;In most of these comic book films the heroes are real downers.
1398;I like seeing characters like Magneto who embrace their powers and use them to their full advantage with enthusiasm.
1399;i look forward to the third film of the franchise as it seems a lot of the emotional weight that Peter Parker carries in the first two films is lifted which might lead to a more enthusiastic and exciting superhero a few years from now.
1400;ray, they look so much better!
1401;My son loves this movie.
1402;the extended film is worth it!
1403;There's a new scene where a friend of MJ's asks her if she's sure she's with the right guy, strengthening the ending.
1404;There are also new bits added to the fight on the train, as well as other bits.
1405;"This would've been interesting, and helped further whet our appetites for ""Spider."

1410;The special effects, showing the good doctor walking and climbing on his robotic arms, are completely believable, as is Ock's sinister, machine.
1411;I loved the first movie.
1412;"Despite Mary Jane's ""bottled"" red hair, the organic webbing and the really lousy Green Goblin costume, the movie was wonderful and deserved all that it took in at the box office."
1413;So, what's so good about the sequel?The plot was amazing.
1414;the special effects in the first movie were, in my opinion, better than most people gave them credit for.
1415;The effects are so real, you won't even notice them.
1416;At times, they'll have close.

1420;"on a side note, my daughter, her ""Spiderman and Friends"" teether held tightly in her hands, sat quietly on my wife's lap throughout the movie."
1421;She was equally dissapointed with it.
1422;I know that when most people go to see a movie, they understand that there is a lot that his going to be fiction.
1423;It has a plot, a hero and a well thought out script.
1424;This is another fine addition to the saga of Peter Parker.
1425;After watching this film, the viewer knows (especially if the viewer is a fan of the story already) that there are many stories still to come.
1426;Alfred Molina, in a great turn as Doctor Octopus, gives Peter a lesson and example in accepting responsibility.
1427;First, we see J. Jonah Jameson's son the astronaut.
1428;the film's focus is on Peter Parker's coming to grips with his responsibility and does not show as much of Doctor Octopus as I may have liked, but this is still a fine story.
1429;I would recommend seeing this movie.
1430;charged, thrilling sequel to the original.
1431;She is now a highly successful Broadway actress who has fallen in love with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Daily Bugle.
1432;The actors, especially Alfred Molina, give excellent performances, and the action and thrills are non.
1433;I highly recommend this fun and action.
1434;There is a fine line when creating a movie based on a comic book character between satisfying the comics' diehard fans, as well as satisfying the casual movie fan who might not be a fan of the comic in question.
1435;"Director Sam Raimi has accomplished both in ""Spiderman 2""."
1436;Grading on a comics curve, the acting is also top notch.
1437;"the chemistry between Tobey Maguire (""Peter Parker/Spiderman"") and Kirsten Dunst (""Mary Jane Watson"") is top."

1445;own for comic fans, and specifically Webheads.
1446;This film came as a surprise to me.
1447;Raimi is a proven director, at least to me.
1448;The casting is appropriate, Thanks goodness all of them signed on again.
1449;He's naturally quiet I hear.
1450;In cider house rules you see a disturbed querry in his performance.
1451;In Spidey 1, he grew in physical bearing, and he pulled off a convincing teenager.
1452;Best actor's always are won by the less popular roles, Like that of the disabled.
1453;A great action flick with a dramatic zest.
1454;Will you see him next movie?
1455;Now, I have to say, with great confidence that Spiderman 2 is the best.
1456;raimi, the script writers, Toby Macguire, Kirsten Dunst and the rest of the cast created a deeply emotional and stunning portrayal of life as a Superhero in the real world.
1457;there are moments in this movie that will have you welling up with tears.
1458;In that moment the true nature of his intentions and motives are revealed to them and and in turn, change their view of him.
1459;The sacrafices of Peter Parker can make you re.
1460;this movie is awesome, emotional and complete.
1461;The effects are better then the first movie and the story is involving.
1462;that is actually well thought out and deserves any respect.
1463;I don't agree with the opinion of that particular person about the movie but I can see their point of view.
1464;I've collected comics for 16 years and have well over seven thousand.
1465;I believe the train rescue scene to be the greatest superhero moment i've ever seen.
1466;Watch it again and think about that.)
1467;This honestly is the best super.
1468;The actor's personalities in this movie are so deep and colorful, it's honestly like the comic book has come to life.
1469;they should keep going with the movies and just keep adding story.
1470;this movie was one of the best movie's I have ever seen, hands down.
1471;See this movie, and accept everything about it.
1472;because it is the best everything.
1473;I love hearing a voice or two pop up to defend this general SHAFT job on the consumers.
1474;There was a few tiny scrathes on both of the discs.
1475;But they both worked perfectly fine.
1476;This is a great movie that I have seen over and over.
1477;It is nice to know that my hubby can watch it anywhere now on his PSP.
1478;Spiderman 2 I think is the best movie based on a comic that I've seen.
1479;It's one of the best sequels ever made as well.
1480;The script is very well done with a ton of character build.
1481;He's so obsessed with it that it's ruining his friendship with Peter.
1482;Plus it's more romantic than the first and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have even better chemestry this time around.
1483;Spiderman 2 is no doubt the best movie of the summer and I doubt anything coming out can compare to it.
1484;The movie has great action(epecially the fight on the train between Spidey and Doc Ock), superb characters, and a wonderful story and I was really glad that Peter and MJ got together at the end of the movie.
1485;The extras were also great, which tells about Spidey, his history, the history surrounding his supporting cast and about the story of the movie.
1486;checking out this movie i didn't know what to expect but it delivered on action and thrills.
1487;"man 2"" is in every way a superior film to the original."
1488;"Don't get me wrong, I loved the original ""Spider."
1489;up Raimi has really found his stride, and explores themes that are awfully sophisticated for what could have easily succeeded as a vacuous summer thrill.
1490;going exploration of the everyman hero that is Peter Parker where the film shines.
1491;This facet of the super.
1492;hero is nicely realized by Tobey Maguire, who, while he may be a rather leaden actor, nonetheless carries himself with a certain dignity that nicely suits the role.
1493;In sharp contrast is the superb Kirsten Dunst, who once again steals the film as the vibrant Mary Jane.
1494;Finally, Alfred Molina offers an outstanding performance as the erstwhile villain, Doctor Octavius.
1495;The special effects are nicely handled, and those surrounding Doc Ock's mechanical arms are particularly impressive.
1496;man occasionally looks a little too perfect, he nonetheless offers some remarkable visual treats.
1497;above all, this is a New York movie, and more specifically, a New York movie informed by 9/11.
1498;It is this element of choice that Raimi explores in his perfectly conflicted Peter Parker.
1499;This transformation is nicely illustrated in a series of scenes that parallel events in the original movie.
1500;In particular, a fire scene links the two movies together in a very effective way.
1501;conversely, the portrayal of Doc Ock as a truly conflicted villain provides the perfect counterpoint.
1502;At this same time, early scenes create a character with tremendous pathos, and as such this is a villain that you don't want to root against out of disgust.
1503;"exciting, funny, original and deeply thoughtful, ""Spider."
1504;"man 2"" is a unique film."
1505;While it can be enjoyed as the mega.
1506;hit that it was, there is a lot going on under the surface, and as such, this film stands apart.
1507;"man 2"" is a real treat, and definitely not to be missed."
1508;This installment is my favorite of the three.
1509;I didn't particularly care for the Green Goblin as Spidey's adversary in #1, but Doc Oc is great in V2.0.
1510;Better effects that the first also.
1511;man 2 is a ok movie.
1512;The action is good, but the relationships are more interesting.
1513;films, this is high praise .
1514;The emotional life of the characters, which is what always distinguished Marvel's best work from other comics, is ripened (even over.
1515;It's done with love and care, and except for young Harry (callow actor instead of the performance of a callow character) it's very well cast.
1516;The shifting camera expands on the original artwork of Steve Ditko who thought in odd camera angles.
1517;"Rosemary Harris is eerily like the Ditko Aunt May, and like Alec Guiness in ""Star Wars"" it's her fate now to be remembered for this instead of a lifetime of great stage work."
1518;Was I the only one smart enough as to realize this?
1519;This was one of the best acted, well scripted movies of '04 period!
1520;It had action, drama, humour, pretty much anything you could ask for in a movie.
1521;Every actor played their role perfectly!
1522;even my date, who hates superhero stuff typically, found this to be an enthralling movie!Final note: The train scene where Spidey saves everyone, without giving away the whole scene, I'll just say it's one of the best movie sequences I've seen in ages.
1523;I got the best bargain because suncoast.
1524;man 2 director Sam Raimi and his talented team of writers, including distinguished novelist Michael Chabon, have crafted what is the finest film I have seen based on a Marvel Comics superhero.
1525;There's more impressive chases and fights between the hero and villain in Spider.
1526;man 2 than I have seen, for example, in the X. men films.
1527;Raimi has done such an excellent job in raising the stakes in the second film, which is literally a major improvement over the first, that it may be a difficult challenge for him to meet.
1528;Aside from Molina, Maguire and Durst, Rosemary Harris gives yet another splendid performance as Peter's aunt.
1529;Composer Danny Elfman's score may be his most brooding ever, equal to his excellent film score for the first Batman film.
1530;Not only is this the best film of 2004 in the action.
1531;adventure genre, it may be among the finest in recent memory.
1532;Life seems good for Peter ever since he's giving up being Spider.
1533;"can Peter Parker's powers return or will the city be doomed?This is a rare sequel that can be better then the original like say ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Godfather II"", ""Superman 2"" or ""Empire Strikes Back""!"
1534;"Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to the instant classic ""Spider."

1539;a must have and must see!
1540;Spider man's movies are very good, great sound,Disc 2 bonus features are great
1541;To refresh your memory, watch this one, which shows the series at it's peak.
1542;The film showcases the frailties of the hero and the humanity of the villain in ways that transcend the superhero genre, and reminds me once again why Peter Parker is my hero.
1543;I think Spiderman 2 is one of the all time best movies.
1544;It is full of both action and adventure, based on the old superhero comics and cartoons.
1545;This one is so much more original and developed than the green goblin, which was used in the first Spiderman movie.
1546;While my hopes for that are high, I firmly believe that Spiderman 2 will be better simply because I know the basis of the plot for the next movie.
1547;I think one of the main reasons this film was such a big success, other than from the past fame, is that it was relatable.
1548;Many people who saw it could relate to the pain that he felt and the utter hopelessness for success and for the woman he loves.
1549;Because of this, it is acceptable to be viewed by most ages of the audience.
1550;to summarize it all, Spiderman 2 is a great blockbuster movie full of action, adventure, and suspense.
1551;It will keep the reader to the seat, and at the end of the film, awaiting the day when the third movie will be released.
1552;I enjoyed them both immensley, but agree that Spidey 2 had more meat on it's bones and a resolution of some aspects of the story that were welcome.
1553;Digitalization done well has to be seen to be believed and the special effects in these movies are highly entertaining and a bit breathtaking.
1554;The making of Spidey Three will be a challenge, but I suspect those in charge will be up to it.
1555;man 2 (2004) pretty much lives up to its praise since its release.
1556;Tobey Maguire turns in a solid performance in the leading role.
1557;I just get a kick out of the movies that come out that look like video games and it makes me think that the makers of the movie should have waited for technology to improve before they made their movies so they'll look more realistic for the always.
1558;anyway, I recommend seeing Spider.

1562;man 2(2004) is a good sequel and a good superhero movie.
1563;"man 2 has high levels of ""brightness""!"
1564;man 2 is blessed with slick, first rate visual effects.
1565;It also starts on a fun note with Peter Parker trying to deliver pizzas with a 29 minute time limit.
1566;The music by Danny Elfman is good.
1567;Spiderman and Doc Ock's fight on a subway train is awesome.
1568;man 2 is a good film that delivers style and substance.

1572;they kept it true to the comic books, now fix the goblin's outfit, make John Jameson into the man.
1573;The best way I have found to describe this movie to people is this:I have collected comics since I was 8 (I am now 30).
1574;One of the main titles for me during this time is Amazing Spider.
1575;When the first movie came out, I loved it, it was everything I could've hoped after waiting almost 20 years for a Spider.
1576;I could be a real fanboy and nitpick at things (origins, organic web.
1577;It's hard for me to describe exactly what I loved about this movie because it's so much more of an emotional attachment to the character.
1578;if you like/love the Spidey comics, and you aren't too much of a fanboy, you will most likely enjoy this movie, at the very least.
1579;So this will be mainly cricticisms.
1580;powers, Peter Parker gained confidence.
1581;Third, the dialogue needs a bit of work.
1582;Watch the WB's Gilmore Girls for an example of well written, interesting, and intelligent dialogue.
1583;Oh yeah, and lastly, please try to keep Spiderman's secret identity SECRET.
1584;Keep up the great work on the fight sequences.
1585;Spiderman's use of webbing is awesome and realistic.
1586;Keep the actors, they truly did an amazing job with what they had.
1587;: ) All in all I am loving Spiderman so far, and have really high hopes for the 3rd movie.
1588;man 2 is even more true to the spirit of the comics than the excellent first movie.
1589;It is not only better than the first movie, it is one of the best movies based on a comic book and one of the best movies ever made.
1590;an outstanding screenplay and great direction make the amazing action even more potent.
1591;The effects are better as is the screenplay.
1592;the message is that each of us can be a hero if we take responsibility when we have the opportunity to help someone.
1593;It is very inspiring and the train sequence is very powerful.
1594;the Cast:Tobey Maguire does a fine job as Spider.
1595;kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane Watson.
1596;james Franco is a great Harry Osborn.
1597;alfred Molina gives a rich performance as Doc Ock/Dr.
1598;Otto OctaviusRosemary Harris as Aunt May Parker has some outstanding moments.
1599;elizabeth Banks is a fantastic Miss Brant.
1600;She should have a bigger part next time, perhaps as competition for MJ.
1601;mageina Tovah is an interesting character as Ursula.
1602;This could have been a great movie.
1603;The acting, the special effects, and the story, all are very good.
1604;He assumed the role because that was what he was great at.
1605;Pride and a sense of achievement, not self.
1606;Even better than the first.
1607;On the whole, a really enjoyable viewing for the whole family.
1608;other than that, there was some pretty good action scenes, I guess.
1609;he has influenced the look of the film.
1610;Sam Raimi started this look in the first movie, but here he has deepened and expanded it.
1611;man 2 is a better movie than the first one.
1612;What's great about this movie is that it is true to its subject.
1613;I attribute a lot of its success to novelist and comic.
1614;The script is light.years better than the original's and it captures the spirit of the Marvel Comics.
1615;There are a lot of smart in.
1616;It is a truly fun movie, which the fans deserve.
1617;Spiderman 2 is superior to its predecessor in every way, and that's saying something.
1618;The original Spiderman was an amazing accomplishment, matching action and special effects with excellent storytelling.
1619;Spiderman 2 expands on that ideal, with bigger and better special effects and a more in.
1620;Molina's performance is probably one of the most memorable for a villian.
1621;Willem Dafoe's performance is the first film was very good but at times a bit over the top .
1622;the special effects are turned up a notch in this film thanks to it's larger budget.
1623;The fight scenes between Spiderman and Doc Ock are more intricate and convincing.
1624;While this makes the film more enjoyable, what really separates this film from other superhero movies is the story revolving around Peter Parker.
1625;this is definitely the best superhero movie of all time, hands down.
1626;Fans of the Spiderman comic book will be thrilled with Sam Raimi's ability to accurately capture the web.
1627;crawler than fans have enjoyed the past 40 years.
1628;If you're not a comic book fan, this is probably one of the few films that you might still enjoy.
1629;This was another great Spider.
1630;Toby McGuire did a great job playing spider.
1631;man and Kirsten Dunst did a great job too.
1632;Alfred Molina did a great job as Doc Oct and this was an all around great movie and I can't wait for the third one to come out.
1633;I was amazed at the clarity of the picture.
1634;This is the finest superhero film done to date.
1635;It is a true thriller in all aspects.
1636;man becomes a much more realistic human being, a little less angst and a little more real world coarseness really works.
1637;The moment where Peter Parker decides to walk away from his other persona and return to the world of meekness and academia is quite effective.
1638;But it is only a temporary respite, and when the moment calls he answers fearlessly, finally accepting the twin burdens he must carry as a hero and a human being.
1639;The film has so many incredible moments that it would be useless to list them all.
1640;Suffice to say the action is astounding and the realization of Doc Ock and his terrifying tentacles of death will leave you in awe.
1641;This is a film that will hold up on multiple viewings and will stand on it's own as a fine example of American cinema.
1642;glad i got a good deal.
1643;thank you for the great deal.
1644;i was happy with the outcome.
1645;hero transformed movie, this is the one of the best.
1646;I am a big fan of Spider.
1647;It tells the flaws of human character making it interesting at the same showcase a true hero worth having.
1648;"Well, the results did not disappoint, ""Spiderman 2"" was a sensational success with audiences, critics, and the box office."
1649;the storytelling and the acting were so incredible and even more mature than expected, that the original film almost pales in comparison, and the original film was great.
1650;"This sequel is a definite must see for comic book fans and movie audiences in general, it contains a little something for everyone, from romance, to action, to comedy, ""Spiderman 2"" will not disappoint."
1651;The first spiderman was great and spiderman 2 was great.
1652;Both were great movies can't say that one was better than the other because they both were great.
1653;Also Kirstin Dunst is hot.
1654;if not WHY?if you want to see something that is in.your face non.
1655;sam Raimi is an incredible director from the evil dead to spiderman, this is the better spiderman so far because the characters are more edgy and the action is more involved.
1656;The emotion, the story, and my god man the action is stupendous.
1657;I am a big diehard fan and I initially thought that you had to have an R rating to go all out.
1658;And you know what I don't mind that because this is a great movie well worth repeat viewings.
1659;As a matter of fact the price of admissions for this movie is a steal.
1660;And the idea to unmask spiderman was so touching.
1661;I enjoyed the first Spider.
1662;yet) and it was definitely one of the better ones I've seen.
1663;so they have a mind of their own and begin to control him.
1664;The characters and conflicts are so believable, despite the inate silliness that comes from being a comic book movie.
1665;the acting is superb as well, all the lead actors are phenomical and perfectly cast.
1666;One of the greatest characters is J. j. Jameson (J. k. Simmons) who is Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle.
1667;He absolutely nails the character and is hilarious throughout the movie.
1668;Another thing the movie did really well was be funny, despite all the angst and conflict going on.
1669;"The ""elevator scene"" in particular was hysterical, as well as the scene with Peter at the laundromat."
1670;they were funny scenes!Action scenes were once again spectacular .
1671;with amazing CGI that was a lot less obvious this time around.
1672;I really wanted to see more!
1673;There was also quite a lot of subtle foreshadowing, indicating a Spider.
1674;Fortunately I had plenty of comic book loving friends with me.
1675;director Sam Raimi keeps a tight grip on the story and the tone light.
1676;He pokes gentle fun at the essential silliness of the genre (the lift scene is hilarious) and doesn't let the special effects overwhelm the most down to earth superhero in the world.
1677;There's a cameo appearance of Sam Raimi's buddy Bruce Campbell as the snooty theatre door attendant.
1678;however, the action was fun, and the critical raves for the movie really are well.
1679;this is a great movie to watch over and over and have fun with the kids.
1680;MOVIE: Once the opening credits begin so does a brilliant montage of the first movie done in the style of a comic book.
1681;What makes this superhero movie stand out from those before it is that it has an enormous amount of character development.
1682;With Batman all the movie is about is kicking ass.
1683;man is such a successful movie is that Tobey Maguire has created such a character in Peter Parker that it allows the audience to really relate to him.
1684;Also Peter Parker is a genuine character, a same as you and me type of guy.
1685;If you think about it, it's just a deeper version of the first one.
1686;I kind of laughed at how Octavius described how he met his wife when she was studying English Literature and he was studying Science.
1687;Overall though a new best for the genre.
1688;Great casts make great movies.
1689;bOTTOM LINE: Some parts of the movie could have been changed for the better, but overall this was one great superhero movie.
1690;alfred Molina did an excellent job portraying him.
1691;But I feel this is a realistic portrayal of the struggle somebody with a double life would be going through.
1692;it's definitely worth having if, like me, you're a big Spidey fan.
1693;a good companion to the first one and it looks like they're setting up for a good story arc to be resolved in the third movie.
1694;this movie was way better than the 1st, and I loved the first.
1695;All of the actors were excellent.
1696;"man 2 continues the story from ""Spider."
1697;the special effects are mind blowing.
1698;"In ""Superman II"", Superman gives up his powers to be with the woman he loves, and villians comes to town and Superman must get his powers to save the day."
1699;overall, it is a good movie to watch pop corn with.
1700;It has great action, drama, and even comedy in it as well.
1701;It has a making of documentary (very good), all the history of Spider.
1702;A neat option on the first disk is pop up factoids that let you know little tid bits about the movie (enhances viewing experiances).
1703;"Torn between this gift and curse of having supernatural abilities with his personal agendas of wants and needs, Peter Parker is the epitome of what it takes to be a superhero, and ""Spider."
1704;"man 2"" is what comic."
1705;tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are the key to the emotional success of these stories.
1706;Maguire has become so good in this role that is more than just an action.
1707;We get a full scope of Maguire's ability to make Spider.
1708;rounded character instead of a two.
1709;Dunst, although still in her teens, is a veteran actress that has added layers to Mary Jane.
1710;intelligent tentacles that force him to continue with experiments that could put Manhattan in mortal danger.
1711;peter Parker feels the great burden of his responsibilities, and the ways in which he tries to deal with it is part of what makes SPIDERMAN a worthy sequel to the 2001 original.
1712;Peter Parker the character is fully given his due, and there is a wonderful authenticity to the film's emotions.
1713;SPIDERMAN 2 is emotionally richer than the original, and that is quite an accomplishment for a sequel.
1714;Even better, the special effects are slightly more convincing than they were in the first film, and there are some bravura action scenes.
1715;particularly one in which Spiderman has to use all his power to stop a moving train.
1716;that equal the best of any superhero epic.
1717;He never expresses emotions through attention.
1718;grabbing gestures, but always stays in character beautifully.
1719;The other performances are good, but Maguire helps take the film to a higher level.
1720;SPIDERMAN 2 is a great sequel, a worthy superhero movie, and terrific entertainment.
1721;The movie caught Peter's excitement at leaving high school, his feeling of apprehension about what is in store for his future, and his questioning of who it is that he should become.
1722;"The message ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" was brilliantly interwoven with the plot, and the scenes really created many dimensions to the character of Peter Parker and the changes that he goes through as he transforms into a hero."
1723;When I saw Spiderman 2, I was spellbound by the opening credits, which are totally gorgeous drawings of the classic scenes in Spiderman 1.
1724;The special effects aren't even that great.
1725;The Green Goblin was actually insane, right up to the moment he died, and that was a villain to remember.
1726;This is a perfect movie with all the good things in it.
1727;Good story, good visuals and good acting.
1728;Tobey rocks in this movie as a Spider.
1729;The story is exciting all the way around.
1730;So, it is recommended and watch it, don't wait.
1731;man 2 is one of the best sequels around.
1732;It's so hard, in fact, that it's affecting his performance(in real life and as the Wallcrawler).
1733;There is some brilliant action in this flick.
1734;the acting is brilliant as well.
1735;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have good chemistry on screen.
1736;The standout performance, though, is from James Franco, who reprises his role as Harry Osbourne.
1737;He begins the film in the same way that he ended the original.
1738;Let's hope he keeps it up.
1739;He may have a bright career ahead of him.
1740;the special effects were good.
1741;Sam Raimi has really captured the essence of Spider.
1742;once you see it, you wont be able to think about anything else all day.
1743;the ending was so cute.
1744;It's a great action packed movie!
1745;So much stuff happens in this movie!
1746;See this movie and you'll love it too!
1747;Quickly the film jumps into action as Spider.
1748;"Moreover, the most difficult issue for Parker to tackle is what his uncle once taught him, ""with great powers comes great responsibility"", as he must withstand his love for Mary Jane in order to protect her from his enemies."
1749;the balancing act performed by Parker is catching up with him as it causes him great stress, which in the end begins to negatively influence his life.
1750;internally Parker struggles with what most people face everyday, choices and the stress brought upon him through his choices, as they influence those around him.
1751;This struggle produces an overburden of stress and seems to weaken him in all aspects of life, as he also finds himself pushing away the people for which he cares.
1752;man is a roller coaster that brings the audience through the high and lows of Parker's life, as he struggles with his existential identity.
1753;Nonetheless, it is intriguing to see Raimi depict the human side of Parker.
1754;sam Raimi does a great job telling the story of Parker and his endeavors as he goes about to find a solution to his problems.
1755;The detailed computer generated images and cool special effects provide spellbinding action as Spider.
1756;compared to the predecessor's work came out fine.
1757;ray to see you again as it is really a spectacle.
1758;man 2 is better than ever and this time the villan has four mechanical arms.
1759;at the end, the hero gets the girl.
1760;This version is funny I mean to have Hal Sparks giving Spider Man about marketing a cologne called THWIPP and JJ Jameson in the Spidey Suit.
1761;i love to see Spiderman use his powers to fight evil by using slashing some of his webbs and climbing on walls.
1762;on Spiderman3 I hope that Peter and Mary Jane get married.
1763;I own quite a few limited editions and they often come with some kind of a senitype and a few cards, which is nice, but.
1764;Following up on a successful film.
1765;especially a runaway blockbuster like the original SPIDER.
1766;mAN 2, the rare sequel to live up to its predecessor.
1767;When ambitious scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into a metal.
1768;man, then who is he?This is a tremendously exciting movie, with great stunts and special effects and the battles between Spider.
1769;man and Doc Ock are a wonder to behold.
1770;man flick, the sequel goes beyond the action and spends a lot of important time building characterization with all the leads.
1771;They are real people with real.
1772;The script is literate and well.
1773;crafted, with the theme of identity/self.
1774;Though it is a much more serious film than many comic.
1775;book adaptations, there is some nice comic relief and the sense of wonder never wavers.
1776;man films is great casting.
1777;man, capturing the essence of the iconic Everyman superhero flawlessly.
1778;Kirsten Dunst is an excellent Mary Jane as well, and in some ways her portrayal of the character is more likeable than the one in the comic book.
1779;man's rogues' gallery after seeing this movie!The only real complaint I have with this film is that Doctor Octopus's character is drawn much more sympathetically than in the source comic, though his personal crisis does parallel Peter Parker's own quite nicely.
1780;whether or not it's equal or better to the original in every respect, SPIDER.
1781;mAN 2 is highly entertaining cinema that most fans will love.
1782;The adventure, drama, and romance are all exceptionally well.
1783;mAN 2 is certainly one of the best superhero movies ever made.
1784;man 2 was a vast improvement on the first film, and represents an intelligent, emotionally satisfying, and genuinely funny take on the character.
1785;The action and special effects are top notice and continue to hold up.
1786;The CGI was good and appropriate where it was applied.
1787;So it's good for the entertainment value but not as a blockbuster.
1788;With great power comes great responsibility.
1789;Following the runaway success, both critically and commercially, of the original film, in Spider.
1790;man 2 they have expertly crafted an exciting action film, with surprising depth.
1791;the very talented and creative Stan Lee created Spider.
1792;(Lee is also responsible for the Fantastic Four, the X. men, Iron Man, and the Hulk).
1793;Indeed, the growing popularity of Spider.
1794;Apart from its great commercial success, Spider.
1795;man fan, Raimi, and star Tobey Maguire had both contracted for three Spider.
1796;man films (before the script for the first one was even written), so following the success of the first film, sequels were inevitable.
1797;man 2 also earning a place in the all.
1798;The amazing CGI, visual effects and SFX generally in the sequel were not a surprise.
1799;taking stunts and gripping action set pieces were not a surprise either.
1800;what I, and I imagine most people, love about Peter Parker/Spider.
1801;man is that despite being a super hero, he is spared none of the problems of ordinary life: He has ups and downs with his friends, family, and employers.
1802;He struggles to get or keep a girlfriend.
1803;A genuine nice guy, with a good sense of humour.
1804;Peter's an ordinary young bloke, with an amazing gif, which he chooses, with great responsibility, to use for the good of humanity.
1805;And, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is engaged to another man.
1806;a strong theme in Spider.
1807;hero permanently on call is taking its toll.
1808;alone film, Raimi has opted to further explore the characters and relationships he set up in the first film.
1809;"man 2 have dreams: Peter dreams of an ordinary life where he can pursue his love for Mary Jane, and his love of science and photography
1810;And this brings us to our villain . . . every hero is measured by their nemesis, the villain, and unlike the Hulk, Spider.
1811;Dr. Otto Octavius (a wonderfully restrained and subtle performance by Alfred Molina) is a good.
1812;hearted and genius scientific researcher, working for Oscorp.
1813;I found this to be a really silly film, though the main acting was actually well done.
1814;Best for boys who read comics.
1815;While Spidey 2 is a terrific film, it is overshadowed by the excitement and anticipation that came with the first film.
1816;man, in this clever, thrilling, and sometimes poignant blockbuster, sure to please all ages.
1817;all the while moonlighting as New York City's greatest crime fighting hero.
1818;man a very real, EveryGuy face"
1819;Maguire, with his puppy dog face and endearing lisp, is the boy you'd like to take you to the prom (or adopt, depending on your age).
1820;Kirsten Dunst is suitably wholesome and perky as his love.
1821;interest, and Alfred Molina is just right as the creepy and campy arch villain.
1822;class and the whole movie is a feast for the eyes.
1823;"popping scenes of Spidey sailing through Manhattan's skyscrapers are great fun
1824;Of course there will be a part 3, and it will be interesting to see how and if it will top part 2.
1825;man 2 was the best superhero movie I've ever seen.
1826;This movie was a classic for me, Tobey Maguire did a good job once again playing as Spider.
1827;The stunts were more beautiful than the first one.
1828;Loved, loved, loved the movie.
1829;It is as good, if not better, than the first.
1830;It is definately worth the money.
1831;Action, love interest, and suspense .
1832;Sam Raimi is back in the director's chair does an brilliant job of directing """"Spider."""
1833;man / Peter Parker and gives an excellent performance.
1834;This is an excellent cast.
1835;office glory and second week at #1) is brilliant.
1836;Danny Elfman is back composing the score and it is an brilliant score.
1837;"The cinematography by Bill Pope, who did the cinematography to all 3 of the Matrix movies and ""Bound"" (1996) all which were directed by the Wachowski Brothers, and whose cinematography debut was Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"" (1990), he also did the cinematography to Raimi's ""Army Of Darkness"" (1993) the finale in the Evil Dead series, does a brilliant job photographing this movie."
1838;"man"" (2002), ""The Gift"" (2000) and ""Army Of Darkness"" (1993) is brilliant."
1839;The casting by Dianne Crittenden is excellent.
1840;"man"" (2002), ""The Gift"" (2000) and ""For The Love Of The Game"" (1999) is brilliant."
1841;The set decoration by Jay Hart is brilliant.

1843;"man"" (2004), ""Stuart Little"" (1999), ""Batman and Robin"" (1997), ""Batman Forever"" (1995), and ""Star Wars"" (1977) (which won the Best Visual Effects Oscar) is brilliant and won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects."
1844;This is an brilliant film and an brilliant sequel.
1845;"executed, some of the things that ""Spider."
1846;It is an brilliant achievement in filmmaking.
1847;Go see it if you want to.
1848;If you want to, you can see it as many times as you want to.
1849;But every know and then, surprisingly impressive part 2 comes along and wows audiences, scoops box.
1850;office success and critical acclaim.
1851;out story, deeper emotion and most importantly, fast.
1852;paced action (The train scene is incredible) work to fantastic effect.
1853;maguire and Dunst show real chemistry and great angst as the tow troubled friends, however Alfred Molina's Dr. otto Octavius is absolutely brilliant, and the computer.
1854;generated interaction with live action elements is seamless.
1855;Themes of friendship and self.
1856;An absolutely magnificent masterpiece that deserves all the box .
1857;i knew straight away after watching the previews that under Rami's steady hand, and having as much experience as you could possibly have with the comic.
1858;book ideas, that this would be something special.
1859;Much akin to Brian Singer's X. mEN 2, second time around a strong layer of confidence is evident, eschewing the fairly everyday filmmaking of Part 1 in favor of an experimental and kinetic style.
1860;However given Raimi's track record for a fantastic storytelling style, it must be a gift to collaborate with people who understand the language of film so fluently.
1861;Danny Elfman's visceral score adds so much to the film's tone.
1862;Doc Ock's theme is an outstanding achievement, building on it's earlier subtle strings, slowly working up to a full.
1863;up, this is the payoff.
1864;I agree with all the ultra positive reviews here (effects great, character development strong, etc) and I thought the film was good, maybe better than the first,But.
1865;in linking Doc Oc to Harry was great!
1866;I'd rather see PP go to another paper that pays him well and allows him to develop some new Spidey gadgets!
1867;I grew up reading Spidey comics in the late 60s/early 70s and I think Tobey really hits Parker nicely.
1868;J Jonah Jameson is also perfectly done.
1869;but, this is a movie with its own agenda, and it fulfills that well.
1870;"Good job on making Doc Ock believable
1871;all in all, worth watching for pure comic book.
1872;I enjoyed the all 3 of the spider man movies and this one is a good one to get if you like the 2nd one.
1873;Alfred Molina's performance is great, as are all of the other actors.
1874;Sam Raimi once again has made an amazing movie, instead of not expanding the characters and focusing on all action he focuses on the characters and makes great action scenes.
1875;Spiderman 6 should be the best movie ever made.
1876;Pretty good sequel to watch if you are a fan of Spiderman.
1877;i own this movie but I only liked it for the action andthe heartfelt story it provided.
1878;but I am happy to say the ASM totally beat out any Spidermanmovie ever made until now.
1879;I love the first one so much and watched it again and again.
1880;There are great new scenes that weren't shown in the theatrical version, especially the one with J. Jonah Jameson.
1881;trust me, it's worth the $13.
1882;Good job i thought they might fall flat with 2 but i think they did a good job I'm from new york and i was in manhattan yesterday where they were filming spider 3 hope it is as much fun as 1 and 2
1883;great action and special effects that were new.
1884;Good story and character development.
1885;I'm a big fan of the 50's cartoons( I so want that new box set!)
1886;It had a very good taste to it.
1887;Dunst is the ONLY good person at acting, well, the guy who played the villain was good to, but besids that, no one can act.
1888;This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.
1889;man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down.
1890;With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then.
1891;But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider.
1892;The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider.
1893;These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train.
1894;This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book.
1895;There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.
1896;i have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider.
1897;But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's Ultimate Spider.
1898;man ) and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.
1899;better then the first movie, good story great fight scenes.
1900;i would recommend this to friends n family.
1901;The excellent Tobey Maguire returns as Spiderman/Peter Parker.
1902;Two years on Peter is now in college and delivering pizza to earn extra cash.
1903;this sequel is on a par with the original, if not even better.
1904;The Special effect are astounding and the fight sequences between Spiderman and Dr Octopus are almost unbelievably realistic.
1905;This film is not only an action packed one but it is also very human as we see the inner struggles of Peter Parker played brilliantly by Tobey Maguire.
1906;It's also comedy and there are many scenes which will make you laugh.
1907;this movie is obviously done by someone who is taking great care on delivering and doing justice to one of the greatest comic book characters.
1908;It's great to have movie directors who grew up reading and being fascinated by these great characters, and that are taking great care of giving fans what they deserve: a great action.
1909;packed movie based on Spidey's adventures.
1910;man 2 is alot better than the overrated 2002 'Spider.
1911;I say that because the film itself has a generous story that's very realistic.
1912;Tobey Maguire as usual was good as Peter Parker/Spider.
1913;By the way, he's still in love in MJ.
1914;He's pretty good in the role, though his screen time is limited.
1915;man 2 is a must for lovers of the comic book and anyone who enjoys emotional and enriching storytelling.
1916;up of incredible action sequences.
1917;MaGuire and Dunst are great young actors who need their proper credit.
1918;it is truly a good film, even if you aren't into fantasy, with laughs, sadness, and action movie fun and intensity all balanced out by a sweet romantic subplot that is nearly THE plot.
1919;Now, I am actually hoping for a great sequel!!!
1920;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and thought it was better than the first, by far.
1921;stop and webslinging, wow, what a rush!!
1922;He battles doctor octavious and saves not only the girl but saves the day as well.
1923;Spiderman was GREAT, but Spiderman II is even BETTER, and that is a very pleasant surprise considering that most would expect the sequel not to be as good.
1924;the movie combines action, adventure and comedy.
1925;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind.
1926;The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again!The plot, the dialogues, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!In short, keep them coming!!!
1927;I cant believe MJ is actually going to go out with JJ's son!
1928;I'm sure ill love the movie!!!
1929;I thought the first Spiderman was okay good, and the sequel to it was fabulous!
1930;There's so much action, and plot and you feel very attached to the characters.
1931;i can't stress how great this movie is.
1932;It's very rare for a sequel to be as good or surpass is prequel.
1933;Sam Raimi and his team stay true to Marvel and bring Spiderman back better than ever.
1934;Doc Ock and his arms were awesome to witness and Peter's character wa great.
1935;Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job of relaying exactly what Peter was going through.
1936;There are very great sequels but this is definitely one of them.
1937;The first Spidey movie was better than this one.
1938;The man created a machine that equals the power of the sun and then it's completely destroyed by simply drowning it?
1939;It's the POWER OF THE SUN, for goodness sakes!
1940;Buried in Peter's muses, that's where!
1941;This movie is significantly better than the original.
1942;I loved the theme of """"responsibility"""" and how it is highlighted throughout the movie."""
1943;One particularily strong moment was immediately after the train rescue, when the crowd carried the injured Spider Man to safety.
1944;The concept that each of us are given certain gifts (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) by our creator and we are obligated to use those gifts for the benefit of mankind is driven home by several of the characters, including the bad guy.
1945;She has to do it!

1948;"man"" and raises the superhero movie bar."
1949;Threaded through all this is his deep love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
1950;Because Peter feels as though he must be a superhero first, he often delivers pizza late.
1951;He is often late to class, and he still is unable to tell Mary Jane that he loves her.
1952;As part of his technique, Dr. Octavius has created a unique set of arms that allow him to directly manipulate the fusion process.
1953;as you can perceive, there is a significant amount of complexity in this movie.
1954;While Peter's life will never be perfect, for a superhero and a human, it may be somewhat normal.
1955;"funny moments) showed Alfred Molina trying to take a drink provided by one of his mechanical arms
1956;There are numerous other features to show how some of the more interesting effects were created.
1957;Technology has been one of the biggest barriers, and has made it easier to create animated characters than live characters.
1958;Now that technology has overcome much of that hurdle, the next difficulty is to make the characters human.
1959;While some may cringe at how real life is for Peter, with the incredible angst created by all his problems, others will applaud the excellent translation from modern comics to the big screen.
1960;Tobey Maguire, Sam Raimi, and the excellent supporting cast have made Spider.
1961;man real they have also created a sequel greater than the original, and created a movie worthy of joining """"Superman"""" and """"Batman"""" was a landmark superhero movie that is destined to become a classic."""
1962;man 2 proves to be a very entertaining movie.
1963;I supposes that is why he make such a good Spiderman.
1964;James Franco who played Harry Osborn still regards Peter as his best buddy but regards him with hostility because he thinks Peter is buddy with Spider.
1965;what works is the special effects, action scenes and interaction between our confused characters.
1966;It definitely kept me engrossed with the visualizations and interesting storyline.
1967;Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction.
1968;Toby did an excellent job in this movie also.
1969;It was as good or better than the first one because of the special effects.
1970;I ordered this movie along with the first Spider Man for my son to catch up with the series.
1971;Great movie and recieved it on time.
1972;The first one was very good, a little cheesy.
1973;If you haven't seen this tur#$@@l yet I'd seriously take a pass on this one.
1974;"expecially the realationship between Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) and his best friend Harry Osborn(James Franco), and the acting of Franco and Maguire is very good, i think Maguire might be one of the most underated actors nowadays, he's very good on movies like ""Pleasantville"" and ""Seabiscuit""."
1975;But something is still on my mind.
1976;He has to be one the best villians in Spider.
1977;, so that puts my hopes of seeing that wicked Black symbiote costume.
1978;The red and blue costume is alright, but the black suit blows them all out the water, the black spider man is just amazing compared to the red/blue one.
1979;Nevertheless the design for Octopus is really amazing, Spider.
1980;"man 2 (is it going to be called ""the amazing spider."
1981;First of all, I have to say that, along with the first Superman film, X2: X. men United and The Dark Knight, Spider.
1982;man 2 counts as one of the greatest comic.
1983;along with a wonderful supporting cast, I love the acting from Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire as the leading characters, Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson.
1984;They have real chemistry, despite the intense anger and apprehension their characters are feeling toward each other.
1985;She has every right to be angry with him.
1986;He's still the most honest, decent young hero the world could ever ask for.
1987;An audience can't help but be drawn to someone who is so good, especially when that person is being treated as badly as Peter is treated by his peers in Spider.
1988;i also love the writing.
1989;She stands in his doorway.
1990;"She tells him, ""I know there will be risks, but I want to face them with you."""
1991;"She tells him, ""Can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision?"
1992;This is the most powerful and amazing declaration of love a woman like MJ could ever do for a shy, kind, good, caring guy like Peter.
1993;ray is well worth every penny.
1994;man 2 is the Casablanca of romances in superhero films.
1995;it will be the #1 movie when it comes out guaranteed.
1996;Best action, best special effects, best story.
1997;overall the best superhero movie ever so far.
1998;The action in this film is incredible and the acting skills by Tobey Maguire is excellent.
1999;AMAZING special effects, by the way.
2000;I thought this was a great sequel to the original Spiderman.
2001;the action sequences are great with terrific special effects, and the romantic relationship between Spiderman and Mary Jane also gets developed much more than in the previous movie.
2002;"I think the strong characterization and more ""intimate"" story line, in its concentrating on a few appealing characters, was an important part of the success of the first three Star Wars movies."
2003;Lucas got away from that approach in the two recent prequels, concentrating more on the big, epic battle scenes and special effects, and so the two prequels just didn't grab me as much as the earlier movies, or these two Spiderman movies.
2004;So don't miss this great sequel, and let Spidey snare you in another fun.
2005;packed web of suspense and adventure.
2006;man 2 is a joyous, sometimes poignant, and never boring.
2007;tale of redemption, adventure, sacrifice, and ordinary people coping with extraordinary events.
2008;But more than that, it is a triumphant return to the spirit of Marvel's comics.
2009;indeed, it is, in the very best sense, the high art of Marvel's best comics brought to life.
2010;but it's more than deep enough, with some moments of honesty and depth that were surprising and satisfying.
2011;Tobey Maguire is the perfect Spider.
2012;likable, funny, and much more complex than the average superhero.
2013;And so we get to watch this young man lift himself up by his costume and face extraordinary tests of will and self.
2014;All of it is pulled together by a great villain.
2015;extraordinary battles, and a romantic quadrangle that waits until the very last moment to reveal a satisfying, yet touching resolution.
2016;breaking 2002 film, the sensational sequel sticks mostly to the rich source material, the Marvel Comics title from 1963.
2017;He's always late, he's broke, his grades are falling and he can't confide in the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
2018;film actor Alfred Molina is a great casting choice as out.
2019;"With this said, I am please to inform all you ""Spidey Fans"" that this sequel is definitely worth purchasing."
2020;Packed with action, great special effects, and (for those who like love stories) a nice continuation of part one.
2021;"part II features all the main characters who survived part I with the original cast playing their part plus a new and a more formidable foe for Spidey ""Dr. Octo""."
2022;peter Parker finds himself torn between the obligation to do good for society, his burning desire to show his love for M. j. and telling her the truth about who he really is, and his desire to keep his friendship with his best friend Harry ( the Green Goblin's son).
2023;tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kriten Dunst (M. j.) do a wonderful job of convincing their audience of their undeniable love for each other while Peter can only keep his love for M. j. to himself, which is something most of us can relate to from our own experiences.
2024;spiderman effectively touches base on the definition of what a true Hero really is which is important for youngsters of today's society.
2025;spider Man II is a Nicely told story with tons of action and great special effects that in my opinion surpasses part I. Viewers will not be disappointed with this sequel.
2026;this set comes with lots of special features that include, Bloopers, The making of the movie, Trivia , Documentary on the newest Villain, multi angle look into one of the most exciting scenes of the movie, and much more.
2027;Spidey 2 is much better than the first one.
2028;Arrived on time and it was a great price and I will take a look at it in the future
2029;Thanks to his secret identity as Spider.
2030;man and Mary Jane has a new boyfriend.
2031;all this is enough to make Peter rethink his superhero ambitions.
2032;The arms also begin to control his actions, and the newly named Doc Ock soon becomes a danger to the city.
2033;but the movie is still entertaining.
2034;The action sequences are great.
2035;The entire cast does a great job again.
2036;And the special effects have improved since the first movie.
2037;this may not be as entertaining as the first movie, but it is still well worth watching.
2038;The first spiderman in the best.
2039;He wants to be normal.
2040;the reason Spiderman 1 is clearly the best is because of the Green Goblin.
2041;By far the best character/actor in the series.
2042;After hearing and reading many reviews about how great this episode was and how it is so much better than the fiirst I can only offer a huge dissapointment.
2043;I recommend Spidey 2.1, more movie in all the right places, especially fighting.
2044;gift for grandson, he just loves Spiderman.
2045;He dressed up like him for Halloween and likes to play in the costume even though it is over and watch the movie
2046;This movie is being hailed as the best superhero movie of all time.
2047;This part of the movie, and the contradictions of life that make the Spider.
2048;man character seem real and human, are what makes this film a movie for movie people, let alone comic book people who would appreciate this film anyway.
2049;Though I think the acting is great (Toby McGuire and.
2050;The special effects were good though.
2051;I think he has already viewed it three times since it arrived.
2052;I'm a fan of Spider.
2053;Alfred Molina is a gifted actor who deserved better.
2054;Lastly, the film does a decent job of continuing the character relationships of the previous film.
2055;He fights evil, murdering criminals, risking his life and livlihood, to make the world a better place.
2056;First off let me tell you that I Love Spider.
2057;I thought Tobey was great in the first film.
2058;Now I think Dunst did a good job as Mary Jane in both films.
2059;But I suggest you see it for yourself because many people loved this movie so maybe you will to, I just thought it was a let down because the first was one of my favorite movies of all time.
2060;My favorite is when spiderman deliver the pizza.
2061;mAN 2 is still one of the best superhero movies ever.
2062;mAN 2.1 reveals how sometimes adding material screws up the film.
2063;Is it fun to see?
2064;The original was extremely well.
2065;Spiderman 2 has some of the highest expectations to ever be placed on a movie.
2066;Spiderman grossed $403 million dollars and is the fifth most successful movie in U. s. history.
2067;His grades are slipping and so are his friendships with his best friends Mary Jane(Dunst) and Harry(Franco).
2068;He has a huge assignment due in school about a famous scientist and Harry happens to know the guy so he gives him the hook up.
2069;He is determined to make his fusion work and will stop at nothing to do it.
2070;He enjoyed meeting Octavius but is saddened by the experience.
2071;peter is happy with his new life.
2072;Will the web slinger give up his new found happy life and stop Doc Ock or will he keep his new found happines.
2073;Raimi's comedic charm is evident all over the film and he takes the story and runs with it.
2074;an excellent story has been given to us.
2075;The screenplay is from Alvin Sargent who has written a comic masterpiece.
2076;The writers did a fantastic job with the story.
2077;tobey McGuire is excellent as Spiderman.
2078;He is perfectly cast as Peter Parker.
2079;He seems more comfortable with the role and he shines.
2080;Like everybody else it's obvious she is more comfortable with the role and it's a bigger one for her this time around.
2081;Molina as Doc Ock is perfect.
2082;A awesome cast was done with this movie and the makers really need to be complimented on the good job.
2083;It's the most entertaining movie of 2004.
2084;It's easily the best comic book movie ever.
2085;Spiderman has always had a more humble human trait that so many other comic heros don't have.
2086;He puts other people above himself and he does so for the right reasons.
2087;With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility and that's why we love Spiderman.You have to see this movie.
2088;This is what a comic movie should be.
2089;It's the best movie to this date of 2004 and is family fun entertainment.
2090;Go see it and be prepared for a great time.
2091;but this has got to be the MAJOR exception to the rule.
2092;the acting is magnificent and it's obvious that the cast worked their little tushies off!
2093;"GRIN Tobey Maguire shines again as Peter Parker, who when he's not Spiderman is the ""Everyman"" who is stuck in a rotten, very low paying job, having problems committing to his girl because he can't tell her he's Spiderman, and he's not exactly able to afford a nice home, either."
2094;Yet he possesses such incredible powers!
2095;He is Spiderman yet incredibly enough he can't make up his mind if he should continue on as both Peter Parker and Spiderman.
2096;"Kirsten Dunst also is cast so well as Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane
2097;Again the acting is totally convincing and a real treat to enjoy.
2098;There's a technical commentary, a """"Spidey Sense 2"""" pop."""
2099;Give yourself and the people you care about a much deserved present this year!
2100;Director Sam Raimi has raised the comics.
2101;acclaimed sequel that has turned out to be a blockbuster in more ways than mere Box Office numbers.
2102;tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spiderman, now scrambling more than ever to meet his engagements on time.
2103;two is one of those sequels that truly is better than the original.
2104;For one thing, on almost every level it is more complex than the first, handling and balancing those complexities as professionally as any movie of its kind.
2105;film superhero I've ever seen.
2106;And no other superfigure can best Spiderman for sense of moral direction.
2107;sequences and visual effects are equally, or more, stunning than in the original.
2108;For a final image we have a hero who is both very much someone with whom we can identify and yet somehow larger than life.
2109;As for other cast members, everyone who was anyone in the first movie comes back for the second.
2110;Finally, Sam Raimi directs those persons and their crises through some very refreshing plot turns.
2111;one entirely worthy of the praise it received.
2112;Spiderman 2 is a marvelous action.
2113;Its premise is that being a hero has its price .
2114;a theme which everyone from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond has written about.
2115;They were the most successful films of their time.
2116;and always has been .
2117;a portion of the audience which demands all action all of the time.
2118;full enjoyment of this sequel requires one to see the original, because so much of the story hinges on knowledge of what happened in the first film.
2119;Otherwise, it's a greatly entertaining endeavor.
2120;man 2, you should love Spider.
2121;The extra scenes are all great scenes that add nuance to the already.
2122;They're mostly extra character bits, things that weren't needed, but certainly help paint the picture.
2123;The extra bits are so well.
2124;most memorable to me were J. Jonah Jameson wearing his newly.
2125;honor about why she's marrying John Jameson.
2126;most of the rest of the special features are all new, including a featurette about the new material.
2127;man 2, keep that bonus disc and give the movie itself to a friend so you have a 3.
2128;in 2007, Sam Raimi made an unabashed piece of s***.
2129;in 2004, Sam Raimi made an actual film with a story.
2130;It's nice to be reminded of an actual personal connection I had to a superhero character.
2131;man 2 has uncommonly witty, intentionally funny dialogue for the comic book movie genre.
2132;J. Jonah Jameson: Thanks for the good news!
2133;And of course, anything from Mr. Ditkovich, the humorous, debt.
2134;high points: Alex Ross' spectacular opening title design, Ditkovich and his family (including a cameo by Louis Lombardi aka Edgar Stiles from 24), an Evil Dead.
2135;this superior sequel ends on a curiously dark, almost chilling music cue and a worried look on Kirsten Dunst's face that left me feeling a bit uneasy.
2136;man 2 is an awesome movie from beginning to end and leaves Spidey fans craving for more.
2137;the beginning of the movie has some very comical scenes as Parker juggles his life as Spider.
2138;Every action scene is breathtaking and Spidey's struggle when fighting Dr. Octopus is felt while watching the movie.
2139;but the best part about this movie other than its action scenes and great visual effects is its sense of character.
2140;Tobey Maguire really conveys the character of Peter Parker well, in that he is able to show the inner struggle Parker faces between choosing to lead a normal life or a life as Spider.
2141;kirsten Dunst does a much better job in her role as Mary Jane than the first film.
2142;man 2 is just as good if not better than X2.
2143;man costume again, the movie kicks into high gear.
2144;She loves HIM but can't figure him out because he can't tell her why he doesn't love her.
2145;"man's lines consist of lines like, ""NO!"""
2146;Sam Raimi is an incredibly gifted director.
2147;And this series WILL finish.
2148;so, how good is this movie?
2149;It?s a solid comic book film.
2150;"As far as movies go this summer, ""The Terminal"" is still the best next to ""Fahrenheit 9/11""."
2151;this Spider has yet to become a Man, but, then again, the story has yet to finish.
2152;The first Spiderman was entertaining.
2153;Spiderman 2 is an amazing achievement.
2154;It is, in fact, as good, or better than the first.
2155;Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is battling his double duties as Spiderman and Peter Parker.
2156;peter's love for Mary Jane begins to take effect on his superhero obligations.
2157;It eventually comes to the point where he decides it is time to give up being Spiderman in order to be able to be with the love of his life.
2158;Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco) is back.
2159;This deal invloves bringing Spiderman to Harry so that he can finally seal the deal with his father's death.
2160;doc Ock, as later called, and Spiderman encounter each other on numerous occassions.
2161;The fight sequences are enjoyable to watch.
2162;Although, I did not feel they were as good as Spiderman vs the Green Goblin, they are worth seeing.
2163;There is also one action sequence on a train, which is probably the main battle.
2164;It is really great to see on the big screen.
2165;This leads to the train fight mentioned above.
2166;spiderman 2 is a really good movie.
2167;"One that is definitely worthy of the title ""summer blockbuster."""
2168;Here, the story evolves around something much bigger.
2169;In the first Spiderman, we caught a glimpse of the inner struggles of Peter Parker, here the come out in full force.
2170;Every superhero has a weakness.
2171;That weakness can also equal strength.
2172;man 2 is a fantastic follow.
2173;I remember to this day going to see the midnight showing for Spider.
2174;Spiderman 2 I think was the best out of all of them and here's why.
2175;Like I said great movie.
2176;I've always believed that super.
2177;There's a real charm to this movie, like its predecessor, that elevates it to a much higher level than the mindless summer flicks with which it plays.
2178;But it's far more complex, more exciting, and more playful than the original.
2179;Molina, and the writing and concept behind his character, is really the strength of the film.
2180;time New York street is as well.
2181;executed and honest as similar scenes in any recent drama.
2182;"man movie has been a great film
2183;man 2 sets out to do something, accomplishes it well, and met my expectations.
2184;This movie in my opinion is a bit better than the first one, as it is more angsty, plus it introduced Doctor Octopus as a character, as well as Peter Parker struggling to keep his secret of Spider.
2185;Handled rather well and realistically, this is definitely not a movie to miss especially if you enjoyed the first one.
2186;I just loved this movie!
2187;It was even better than the first one!
2188;Oh wait, did I enjoy the first one?
2189;And along with this one, they're both alright.
2190;Dr. Otto Octavious was just a man who loved his wife very much .
2191;The ending is really spectacular, and therefore, upped my rating of the movie.
2192;It's amazing on the big screen, and Mary Jane features pretty big in the finale .
2193;There are also a lot of hints about a Spiderman 3, so watch carefully.
2194;despite not liking (hate is too strong a word) most of this film, I did enjoy the ending, and it will be interesting to see what they do with the third, without rehashing the first two.
2195;I'll definitely notice him on screen that way!
2196;This was truly one of the best films I've seen this year i went to see it twice it was that good!
2197;I absoulutly loved it i am a huge spiderman fan im obsessed with spider man and Tobey Maguire is adorable he did an amazing job as Peter Parker good job it wasnt sappy either this was definatly better than the first by far.
2198;I really enjoyed the first Spiderman movie and was anticipating the sequel and then had the unfortunate opportunity to actually see it.
2199;That is partially because Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and also because the scripts, special effects, and supporting cast are phenomenal as well.
2200;Spiderman 2 is even better than its predecessor.
2201;the audience will be glad to see a resolution to the Peter/Mary Jane romance, as well as a surprise cameo at the end that gives us a big hint as to what """"Spiderman 3"""" will be about."""
2202;"Hopefully the next installment of the ""Spiderman"" series will continue the trend of topping the movie that came before it."
2203;This is another smashing Spiderman movie.
2204;The special effects are outstanding.
2205;the movie will hold your attention throughout.
2206;This is my favorite out of the series.

2208;Other than that, the movie was flawless, gripping, and awsome.

2211;The story is also quite entertaining and engaging.

2215;which is how most comic book hero movies play out.
2216;"man 2"" actually has true, deep scenes of drama, enough to move you ."
2217;and it's very few, if any, comic.
2218;"man"" was one more of curious interest, than true appreciation, since it was a rather safe delivery."

2220;Most importantly, you care for these characters .

2222;"man 2"" is a great improvement on the first movie, and definitely beats the sophomore jinx, making the rare sequel that is much better than the first."
2223;"lastly, the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" bit/montage was very humorous, and a nice touch, punctuated by one big wink."
2224;Spiderman 2 is a touching, sad movie with a major emphasis away from the physical feats of daring and a audacious move towards, for this type of genre movie, the personal and emotional life of it's hero: Peter Parker wants a normal life but realizes that it is not in the cards for him.
2225;"sam Raimi, director of ""Spiderman2"" has opted to make a movie filled with pathos and sadness, though the scenes of daring."
2226;But the lingering feeling you take away from this movie is one of emotional angst and the very real feeling that emotional connections are not easily attained nor kept.
2227;Great fights with Dr. Octopus.
2228;The ending is what really got me.
2229;Spiderman is back in one of the best sequels since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
2230;down apartment, keeping his grades up, while continuing his Spidey exploits.
2231;Dr. Octavius has a way to create and harness a tiny sun.
2232;The movie overdoes the comedy somewhat.
2233;This is a excellent film.
2234;The action is there and very brutal but it is primarily a love story a a redemption story with a superhero thrown in.
2235;the visuals were much smoother in my opinion than the first one, particularly Spidey swinging along the buildings.
2236;Oscar needs to get off his snooty horse and acknowledge a truly excellent and worthy film.
2237;"mAN 2 has everything a good movie should have: a marvelous cast
2238;man interferes with everything in his life: his job, his education, and most importantly, his relationship with Mary Jane.
2239;Dunst meanwhile is not only stunning physically, but she is a darned good actress, giving Mary Jane just the right amount of naivete and spunk.
2240;Molina is the perfect villain as the incredibly designed Doctor Ock!
2241;He uses his impressive acting abilities to bring both compassion and hatred.
2242;Ms. Harris is beautiful as Peter's Aunt May.
2243;A seasoned theatrical and movie actress, Harris embodies the essence of paternal and familial love.
2244;J. K. Simmons as Peter's editor boss is outrageously campy and brilliant.
2245;the movie has breathtaking action scenes, including the one on the train, but all of them are mindboggling.
2246;mAN 2 is what moviemaking is all about and fun as hell to boot!
2247;Spiderman 2 contains a lot of action and excellent special effects.
2248;The movie starts off where the first one left off: Spiderman is at the peak of his superhero status, and as with any peak, there is a fall in store.
2249;Well, he has a job to do.
2250;I do not usually prefer superhero movies, but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2251;A mother's love for her son (even though we all know Aunt May is not technically Peter's mom).
2252;A love story between two people who are really in love with Peter and MJ.
2253;A deceptively creative subplots like Harry's discovery of his father's Green Goblin gear.
2254;It's a tribute to Raimi's directorial skill that he was able to put his ego aside and get the heck out of the way of a great story.
2255;man 2, on the other hand, has Raimi written all over it.
2256;man 2, we pick up two years later and yet, things are still pretty much the same.
2257;smart, but unlucky in just about everything.
2258;conversely, things are going swimmingly well for Mary.
2259;She gets great acting gigs.
2260;And oh yeah, the tentacles work based off of Doc Ock's neuro.
2261;His tentacles have a personality of their own and they undulate and twist in the background as Doc Ock gestures.
2262;despite the change in pace, the fight scenes are filled with amazing feats of agility.
2263;man's not just acrobatic, he THINKS fast and the contortions he resorts to display that magnificent superhuman speed.
2264;man 2 is a real treat.
2265;packed, gets the girl in the end etc.your average sequel to an amazing movie.
2266;hero, the affects of this action brrings about conflict between him and his ex.
2267;villians, his loved ones and and also with his previous life.
2268;The plot was interesting and kept my attention, yet it was the details around the main concept of the movie that were boring.
2269;I am hoping that they will realize that the originals will always be better than the following and will call it quits to spider.
2270;What makes it better is there is more action and roll along at a good pace.
2271;With the origin of how Spiderman came to be out of the way, the movie kicks right in.
2272;Peter Parker has put his social life on hold and has taken to crime fighting fulltime"
2273;Now there is a new villian, Doc Ock.
2274;He has four mechanical arms.
2275;This is a great movie all around.
2276;I need to know, do you love me?
2277;In such a pivotal sequence, we can see the troubles of two characters, two dynamic characters.
2278;Come on, everyone knows it.
2279;man 2, the hype came down to this, a 2 hour and 7 minute masterpiece.
2280;restart, well, that says something.
2281;I could easily call this the greatest superhero film of all time, but I'd be wrong.
2282;It's a wonderful addition to the greatest superhero saga of all time.
2283;Each section, like the original and now the predecessors, are brilliant.
2284;I've never seen a combination of great casting since maybe Back to the Future or Indiana Jones.
2285;When we look back, these films are going to be up there in the memorable favorites/classics, and it's primarily because of this working team.
2286;Maguire is Parker, Dunst is MJ.
2287;Taking time and making sure everything is well, is well, what makes this, THIS.
2288;The writers do an exceptional job here, paving highways to accessible storylines, where we are given hints, but all mere speculation, although, there is one big hint.
2289;sensational and overwhelming, every time I watch these films, it's just that.
2290;I turned, I kicked the seat, I squirmed, and it was all because of that.
2291;She means a lot to me, everything in the world, I knew this already, and she knew this.
2292;man 2 is easily the best comic book movie in the last decade, and possibly the best ever.
2293;"Combining a great hero and villain with a great story and amazing special effects, ""Spider."
2294;"man 2"" is a great movie, period."
2295;It picks up a few years after the original, with Peter Parker (Maguire) still pining after the girl he will never let himself have, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst).
2296;prize winning author Michael Chabon, Sam Raimi has crafted a sequel that far outshines its solid predecessor.
2297;Maguire has made Peter Parker his own, and Alfred Molina breathes intelligent menace into Doc Ock.
2298;The special effects, especially during the fight scenes, and incredible.
2299;These are easily some of the best fight scenes ever put on film.
2300;This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone.
2301;2 will be difficult to top, but if Raimi continues to pour his passion for the character into the movies, he will have a good shot.
2302;I laughed at the situation when Spiderman becomes web.
2303;book superhero, with more to come gathering that the profit margin was still worth the high production price for Columbia Pictures.
2304;As Peter does all he can to balance his two lives, those in the real world are moving on with theirs .
2305;Even his best friend, Harry Osborne, has moved on and taken over operations at Oscorp .
2306;The family business is all that keeps him on the level of sanity and Harry has big plans for Dr. Otto Octavius' new device to create and control fusion power, which, in essence, puts the power of the stars in the hands of mankind.
2307;Just as he is beginning to enjoy the retirement he has taken from the superhero life, Peter Parker must again put on the suit and fulfill the promise he made to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it.
2308;man 2, though flawed, is without a doubt one of the best comic.
2309;book adaptations ever put on screen and excels beyond the expectations set not only by the original but every comic.
2310;book franchise that has come before it, including that of the winged one himself, Batman.
2311;around and there is substantial improvement in their performances from the last time we saw them, though that can not be said of everyone.
2312;"Maguire is given a lot more room to demonstrate emotionally what the character of Peter Parker is going through
2313;Crafted in such the perfect manner, Mary Jane is not another dimwitted damsel in distress as the connection between Spider.
2314;And just when you thought he was gone for good .
2315;man 2 delivers most of what the hype and promotion promise, not only in the areas of spectacular special effects and an emotionally driven storyline, but in the film's enduring message of heroism and self.
2316;There is one specific shot, when Spider.
2317;man (costume and all) makes his first appearance, where a woman shouts, """"You go, Spidey!"""""""
2318;Third, some of the sequel's more subtle jokes, namely the homage to Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, are lost on the majority of the film's target audience, though they are quite humorous to those that know what they are referring to.
2319;And finally, the film's final sequence, in which the audience sees Spider.
2320;man 2 seem to significantly out weigh the good, the film's emotionally driven messages of self.
2321;we just have to make the choice listen to the voice that lets it shine through if it means we have to give up on the things we want the most in life.
2322;It's easy to relate the idea of self.
2323;sacrificing men and women of the armed forces with respect and admiration, and, in a slightly smaller way, they still do today.
2324;Symbolism of this can be found in Spider.
2325;to bring justice to those that deserve it.
2326;And I stand by that statement completly.
2327;man 2 is an amazing movie, that is essentially 3 movies wrapped in one.
2328;It is a romance, a super.
2329;hero movie, and an action packed movie all wrapped in one to create what we call Spider.
2330;you will see Harry as completely disgusted with Peter, especially because he takes pictures of his father's killer.
2331;jane and Peter will also see character development with a new man in MJ's life.
2332;man 2 which adds so much to the great movie that it already is.
2333;The direction in the movie is great, not to mention the acting.
2334;James Franco does a great job with Harry Osborne.
2335;"He is the true standout of the movie
2336;but it is the best movie I have seen this year.
2337;It has amazing special effects, great directing and acting, and the story is second to none.
2338;all of the hype times about two and that is truly how good this movie is.
2339;I reccomend this movie to anybody out there .
2340;but I also reccomend that you see the original Spider.
2341;Great movie and the action is great.
2342;If your a spiderman fan than this movie is worth the price.
2343;man movie was great, and this one follows in its footsteps.
2344;It is always impressive to see Spider.
2345;man display his powers, and with modern special effects, we get to see him in all of his glory, as his creator Stan Lee had intended.
2346;There is one particular part in this movie that brings a tear to my eye.
2347;The rest of the movie is good too, but that is my favorite part.
2348;If you like comic books, action films, or both, I recommend this title to you.
2349;man 2 finds Peter Parker about 2 years after the first """"Spider."""
2350;"man"" are consistent in style and tone, thanks to Sam Raimi's repeat directorial effort."
2351;"man 3"" brings a new theme."
2352;Simmon's bluster is pure fun to watch and one of the most enjoyable details of the Spider.
2353;"man 2"" is a big, bold comic book adaptation that overcomes its own silliness with great looks, action, and fun."
2354;A good time for all.
2355;nice to have and keep forever
2356;The graphics are so good that my Half.
2357;life 2 game can go for Oscar for special effects.
2358;Spiderman 2 is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman film that has come out so far.
2359;this film almost embodies Spiderman almost perfectly.
2360;This is definitely Tobey McGuires best performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman.
2361;I cannot say it is his best performance period because I havent seen all of his films, but it is definitely his best performance as this character.
2362;This film really captures Spiderman and people love him even now.
2363;they also handle Harry and his ark perfectly.
2364;At the end of the film you see where that ultimately leads him.
2365;rosemary Harries gives an amazing performance as Aunt May like in the last, except she is even better here.
2366;The scenes where Peter is talking to her about Uncle Bens death and when she gives her speech about heroes they are amazing and the best scenes in the movie.
2367;doc Oc, I think, they actually improved upon from the comics.
2368;He has a noble goal, to create renewable energy for all.
2369;the action is also top notch in this.
2370;This film has the best action scenes of all the Spiderman films.
2371;Spiderman 3 had some great action as well but this, in my opinion, still takes the cake.
2372;The fight between Spiderman and Doc Oc on the clock tower and the train are phenomenal.
2373;It is the best fight in the entire franchise.
2374;The effects are amazing and really help make the action amazing.
2375;She also comes off as a bit selfish in this film as well.
2376;It does not bother me too much since I saw Spiderman 2 before Kiki, but I still find that quite amusing.
2377;Dunst who plays Mary Jane in these movies also voiced Kiki in the dub of Kikis Delivery Service which is her best performance in my opinion.
2378;Did she have some creative input she was not credited for?Overall, Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman film easily.
2379;If you are a fan of Spiderman then definitely see this film.
2380;It has great action, great effects, great story, and it comes closest to the characters in the comics than any of the other films.
2381;This film is pretty self.
2382;man to pursue a normal life and win Mary Jane's heart.
2383;But things become interesting however, when Peter's best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco) puts a price on Spider.
2384;man film was so enjoyable, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give this film a shot.
2385;Not only was it more enjoyable than the first film, but I can honestly say that it is the best superhero film that I have ever seen beating out Batman, Superman, and X2.
2386;man 2 is such a cut above the rest is because of the acting and the amazing special effects.
2387;I also love watching the story unfold in this film.
2388;It has a menacing villan in Doc Ock and gives a well rounded look at the hero of the story by offering excellent character development with both Peter Parker and his alter.
2389;Peter has to struggle with losing his powers, facing a very formidable advissary in Doc Ock, as well as trying to lead a normal life, win Mary Jane's heart, and keep his identity secret from his best friend Harry who holds his alter.
2390;Tobey Mcguire was absolutely brilliant in the role of Peter Parker and made the super Spider.
2391;Watching Peter Parker struggle to have a normal life was my favorite aspect of the film.
2392;Molina has openly admitted that this was not the usual type of character that he plays, and that is what impressed me so much with his performance.
2393;man 2 is the best superhero film that I have ever seen.
2394;The incredible acting, amazing special effects, and well rounded story all make this film extremely enjoyable.
2395;I have to admit it first I was more than excited to see Spider.
2396;"In the opening munites of ""Spiderman 2,"" the thrilling and deeper sequel to the wide."
2397;budget summer action flick (and a huge action flick, with a budget of $200 million).
2398;But director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant have higher goals.
2399;They stick to the story and tone of the comic books, giving the film has a sense of integrity and rich charcter development that elevate to the realm of greatness.
2400;Spidey's battle with Doc Ock are breathtaking, climaxing in an above.
2401;"But more imprtantly, the filmmakers put the focus squarely of the characters and their relationships (good, bad and ugly), ""Spiderman 2"" achieves nothing short of greatness and longevity, encompassing the best of what comic book films have to offer."
2402;This movie is by the far the best superhero movie made.
2403;"This movie as it all
2404;After seeing the ending of Spider Man 2 it makes Spider Man 3 the most awaited movie in history!
2405;Spiderman 2 presents a whole new picture of the loved spider.
2406;No longer just dealing with the simply intricacies of relationships, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) now has to fix all his relationships, with his best friend, his aunt, and Mary Jane.
2407;As Peter's life gets complex so does the movie with cooler shots and an overall more in depth story.
2408;With a tantalizing touch of the trio's triumphant third movie (a lead into the third Spiderman), I would say the movie wrapped itself up in success.
2409;It was very good, and equal if not better than the first as we see the spider behind the mask much more.
2410;And after hearing everyone talk about how this is one of the best superhero movies around, I figured I'd give it a shot though the first Spidey film didn't impress me much.
2411;esteem, common sense, or personality.
2412;NEWSFLASH: Maybe it's just a speeder, Spidey.
2413;This is one of the best superhero films.
2414;It holds up pretty well even after a decade.
2415;It has humor, great action and special f/x.
2416;Fun for the whole family.
2417;I love the Spiderman movies.
2418;They are good superhero movies with limited violence.
2419;Doc Ock is truly a memorable villian.
2420;Tobey and Kirsten are very good as well, but J. k. Simmons once again steal the show as the newspaper boss and thankfully gets a much bigger role in this movie.
2421;I also loved the opening credit sequence that fills you in on Spider.
2422;The ending with Harry finding his father's glider and weapons was really pretty neat, but I just hope Spider.
2423;Bring on Venom in the next Spidey flick!
2424;While this comic book franchise can't compare to the first two Batman or Superman films, it sits nicely in third place behind them.
2425;Join the rest of society and swing by your local theater to see this flick now!
2426;I will add some simple comments about this movie.
2427;THe villian, Doc Ock, was awesome and well.
2428;the visual effects are astounding and greatly add to the overall feel of the movie.
2429;Also, as a minor point, the Editor provided some nice comic relief, as always.
2430;For a sequel, it is a good follow.
2431;man 2 is the most exciting film I saw in theaters this year.
2432;man did was expanded upon and polished to the point of perfection.
2433;And yes, as many people have already said, this is by far the best comic book movie ever.
2434;i thoroughly enjoyed the first Spider.
2435;It really is something of a masterpiece.
2436;The writing, the acting, the special effects.
2437;I was moved, to say the least, by the intertwined fates of Peter Parker, Dr. Octavius, and Harry Osborn.
2438;I was particularly surprised by the screen presence of James Franco.
2439;He stepped up to the plate and hit a home run here, delivering a breakout performance sure to merit him great roles in the bright future he has ahead.
2440;The film flows with sublime efficiency, never losing its cool and never blowing its top.
2441;The screenwriters did such a great job here.
2442;The struggles of Peter Parker here are so easy to relate to, the sympathy I felt for Spider.
2443;this is a comic book movie, people!
2444;And these characters are real people with real problems!
2445;So gratifying is it to be so thrilled and so moved from one film that I'm really at a loss for words.
2446;man 2 is without a doubt one of the best films of 2004.
2447;One of the best sequels I have ever seen!!
2448;Peter is having all of these emotions because he knows he loves MJ, but he can't love her because he is Spider.
2449;And will Peter end up with MJ.
2450;Go see the movie to find out!
2451;Two years ago, I saw Spider.
2452;I was greatly surprised when the movie grossed over 114 million on its opening weekend.
2453;man 2 an excellent sequel but it also almost destroys the stereotype that sequels are bad.
2454;man and living his everyday life.
2455;Nonetheless, you almost forgot it as you're watching the film.
2456;There are a couple of great shots.
2457;Visuals are just as good and the special effects are a large improvement over the originals.
2458;man 2 is the perfect popcorn summer flick.
2459;The fight sequences are also a sight for the eyes and should appeal to any action fan.
2460;Perhaps the best part of Spider.
2461;man 2 is how it has the perfect mix of stylized action and story.
2462;man 2 is five times better than the first and it deserves to be seen.
2463;It has everything a movie should have: a conflict that results in some action sequences, a moving story with great performances, some comedy tossed in to lighten the mood, brilliant visual effects, and excellent directing.
2464;This movie must be seen"
2465;Sam Raimi's love for the material really shows through in these films.
2466;It's obviously in the studio's best interest to make sure they choose a director that has a real appreciation for the story and characters.
2467;So few sequels outshine the original.
2468;This film works on many levels and defies it's popcorn movie status everuy step of the way.
2469;Perfectly cast, Great adaption to the comic book and a fantastic perfomances by Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, way better than in the comic!
2470;tobey Maguire is the true Hero Spiderman.
2471;Though I may have thought like others that Raimi made a bad choice in choosing Tobey in Spiderman I, but he really did shine up the role in II.
2472;Spiderman is actually written on all over his face.
2473;Part III will be more of a ultimate showdown.
2474;This time we see more of Peter Parker and his issues with life (his superhero role of Spiderman, college education and MJ, the love of his life).
2475;There are some choices that he has got to make.
2476;There is also a very special HERO other than spiderman in the movie, I wont mention who.
2477;The Spiderman II xperience was very entertaining.
2478;i do really love the Train sequence.
2479;It does reflect courage as a whole and does have strains of patriotism, self esteem and respect of ones courage.
2480;crawler so real, that few people would be hard pressed to see themselves in his shoes.
2481;Spidey can't even attend a Broadway musical without being sidetracked by his superhero duties.
2482;"Peter now facelss the greatest dilemma of his life: will he continue using his powers in his battle against evil, or we he be ""Spider."
2483;Like the first film, SPIDER.
2484;Will he somehow manage to balance a life heroics with his own life?SPIDER.
2485;And with the standards parts one and two have set, one can only imagine (and hope) that the upcoming SPIDER.
2486;This movie is a fantastic sequel!
2487;The technological marvels of CGI (Computer Generated Images) is breathtaking!
2488;It's amazing how real the scenes were, especially with Doctor Octopus.
2489;"It was the most ""real feeling"" sci."
2490;All characters were nicely represented and the plight of Spiderman was nicely filmed.
2491;I can admit when a movie I don't like is good in spite of my opinion of it.
2492;This movie was destined to [.]
2493;Spiderman is about the lamest series in comic book history.
2494;We thoroughly enjoyed the movie but found that in some places the movie seemed to drag.
2495;I wouldn't say it's better than the first but it's just as good in it's own right.
2496;man AND a Sam Raimi fan.
2497;It's the truest adaptation of a comic I've ever seen (with the exception of the original Crow movie).
2498;Sam Raimi has captivated audiences with what was truly an astounding movie.
2499;The train scene was the most intense movie scene I've ever seen!!
2500;I had high expectations of this movie and I thought it would strongly surpass the first.
2501;And I'm really suprised to see all of the high reviews for this movie.
2502;i would high recommend NOT seeing this movie in the movies.
2503;Very few directors really understand the appeal of superhero comicbooks.
2504;The result is solid action.
2505;adventure with well developed characters that pull you into the story and keep you emotionally invested.
2506;The action choreography is stunning and the special effects are polished.
2507;man 2 has a talented cast that really brings this story to life .
2508;the story has excellent pacing and a great sense of increasing stakes.
2509;"There are moments of emotional gravity, but the tone remains light while delivering the goods at the ""big moments"" ."
2510;just like a summer movie should.
2511;some nice cinematography really makes the most out of some truly inspired set pieces and it's all edited together rather elegantly.
2512;When all is said and done, there is more than enough fun and visceral thrills to go around .
2513;handled in a way that keeps the material close to it's pulp roots.
2514;More importantly, the conclusion is satisfying without everything being tied up into too neat a bow.
2515;Aftter seeing the first installment of the Spider.
2516;For everyone who loved the first one, this movie will make your mind go crazy.
2517;All of the twists and turns in this movie lead up to one final scene that will leave you satisfied for weeks.
2518;This is by far my favorite movie ever!!
2519;Alfred Molina is amazing as Doc Ock, James Franco is great, Rosemary Harris, but as expected, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst steal the show!
2520;"Bear with me people, as the only voice of dissension among the crowd, this review is going to be long:1) ""With great power, comes a great need to whine for 2 hours."""
2521;Despite the fact that the story of Spiderman/Peter Parker was already established in the first movie and also known through basic pop culture, thank you writers (one including my favorite author/Pulitzer Prize winner, Michael Chabon.
2522;My only conclusion was that she is the daughter or mistress of a powerful producer whose money was involved in the making of this movie.
2523;5) I really wish they had used more James Franco (Harry Osbourne) his character is so rich and complex and his bitch.
2524;The mirror scene in the first movie where Osbourne plays himself and the goblin was great.
2525;With a more character driven plot and bigger tools at their disposal, director Sam Raimi and his crew have gone above and beyond the first Spider.
2526;"man film
2527;man 2 deserves that tagline (that honor goes to X2: X. men United), the film sure is something special as more depth is given to Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, ever perfect) as he struggles between being a super hero and his love for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as a new foe emerges.
2528;It's definitely worth seeing, and even jaded web.
2529;heads will admire the film.
2530;Sorry, I got a off on a tangent, Spike Lee style.
2531;this truly outdoes the first movie in terms of scale.
2532;I don't like to use this word to describe a lot of things, but truly only one word describes this movie: epic.
2533;Add to that his stressful friendship with Harry, his identity crisis, and you've got a pretty complex story, superhero action movie or not.
2534;**You feel the full spectrum of emotions in this movie.
2535;I've said it already and I'll say it again, Peter Parker's crumbling relationship with Mary Jane was executed perfectly.
2536;It's like a complex tapestry that all fits together and makes sense somehow.
2537;It would've been a great place to end, the music was PERFECT right at that instant she looked up into the sky at him, with that bright light illuminating her face.
2538;I liked this one also.
2539;Lots of action and good special effects.
2540;I will keep it in my collection.
2541;Let's give high praise to Sam Raimi and his great crew for not churning out another comic.
2542;Lets also praise him for making a sequel that is a true triumph over the original.
2543;man 2 is a terrific film.
2544;In this film, the drama is just as prominent as the battles, and believe me, the battles are very cool and well done.
2545;Spiderman 2 is superb and probably one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, if not the greatest.
2546;Everything about this movie is outstanding and not for one moment do you really want to take your eyes off the screen.
2547;Without revealing any of the story plot, I can honestly tell you that it is incredible, especially the romantically plot between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst), Harry Osborne's (Franco) quest to kill Spiderman, and Dr. Octopus (Molina) trying to capture Spiderman.
2548;Dr. Octopus is truly scary, and is a great villain in this movie and the Spiderman franchise as a whole.
2549;Every actor was extraordinary in this movie, with each actor accurately portraying the emotions they should feel and also showing style during action scenes.
2550;Maguire has shown us before that he is an outstanding actor, and he has shown us again that he has the ability to do it.
2551;Kudos to the director as well, for he did an amazing job directing this movie and graphically making it the way it should look.
2552;The web slinging superhero is back, and better than ever!
2553;Superstar Tobey Maguire (""""Seabiscuit"""") returns as the amazing Spider."""
2554;"man in the summer's most anticipated sequel, ""Spider."
2555;"About a couple of days ago at the theater, I saw what I expected to be not only one of the best summer sequels since last year's mega hit, ""X2: X. men United"", but also a sequel that has more thrilling action and more breathtaking visual effects than its 2002 predecessor."
2556;"The direction of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness""), who helmed directing duties for the first blockbuster, has really outdone himself with his intense direction of this action."
2557;"man 2"" are Kirsten Dunst (""Bring It On""), James Franco (""The Company""), Rosemary Harris (""Sunshine""), and J. k. Simmons (""Hidalgo""), in which they gave flawless performances!"
2558;"Joining the cast are the excellent talents of Donna Murphy (""Star Trek: Insurrection"") and Dylan Baker (""Head of State"")."
2559;"man 2"" takes place 2 years after the events of first film, in which Peter Parker (Maguire), as Spider."
2560;Mary Jane is now a model and actress, still pining for Peter's affections but ready to move on when she gets engaged to NASA astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of the Daily Bugle's sleazy editor, J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons), and Peter feels that he might lose her forever.
2561;Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), a brilliant, renowned scientist working for OsCorp, has developed not only the formula for fusion but also has a set of four mechanical arms that can keep the gravitational pull and outlashings of the fusion in check.
2562;Because not only is Mary Jane caught in the middle of Doc Ock's terror, but Peter's best friend, Harry, enlists Doc Ock's help in order to take down the man Harry feels is responsible for his father's death!
2563;For fans (like myself) of the first film, the sequel will be an exhilarating ride.
2564;Every element of the storytelling is a leap beyond the first film.
2565;But while the action occasionally veers into melodrama, we get a much more complicated and developed sense of all the film's characters.
2566;Even Rosemary Harris' Aunt May character has more to do, and her own drama and dilemmas are nicely rounded.
2567;"act subway showdown is exhilarating (not to mention, one of my favorite ""S. m 2"" action scenes)!"
2568;getting along in the world, finding love, liking himself .
2569;"man 2"" has exactly what a blockbuster sequel should have: mind."
2570;blowing action and suspense, some laugh.
2571;blowing special effects, and a powerful, top.
2572;"man 2"" is the human story, which best reaches its audience and, in doing so, improves upon otherwise excellent predecessors."
2573;"man 2"" tickles the heart and the brain, suspends considerable disbelief, and does so with commanding flourish ."
2574;transcending the genre and succeeding as a great movie in and of itself.
2575;And in the end, all I have to say is.
2576;Pleased with his directoral accomplishment of the first film and comfortable with his talents, Sam Raimi weaves this film together with a fluidic ease that comes across flawless to every single moviegoer that saw this.
2577;It's been said over and over but the best thing about this movie is that it chooses to focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider.
2578;This is what's so charming about the character.
2579;But he's learning how to be a real person.
2580;This movie is worth every penny you spend.
2581;Spiderman 2 ranks right up there with The Empire Strikes Backs as one of the best sequels ever made.
2582;Sam Raimi super sequel not only blows away the first movie in sheer thrill but also in sheer heart as well.
2583;Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristin Dunst) had a great chemisty in this film!
2584;Doctor Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) was great villian to Spiderman!
2585;I like the movie's story, special effects, and great action sequences!
2586;Sam Rami did wonderful job on this project.
2587;i think Tobey Maguire and Kristin Dunst deserves a. lot of credit for making this movie!
2588;The love story between Spiderman/Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson is an important element in this movie!
2589;man 2 the movie that leapt both hurdles, and made it look easy.
2590;With great power comes great responsibility we heard in the first movie .
2591;great job, wildly entertaining, excellent FX, super super.
2592;Worth adding to your collection.
2593;I liked it when I first saw it, and I still really enjoy it, hence the 3 stars.
2594;The action is fine, most of the plot, sure, its ok, but I didn't like a few very big things about this movie.1.
2595;He uses these jokes to help himself stay sane.3.
2596;Yeah, he's super strong, but he can be broken.
2597;so the action was great, the story was good, but so many little things annoyed me a lot.
2598;While most say numbe 3 will be the worst, I enjoyed it much more.
2599;I like the way they took liberties with the Sandman, adding a more human element to him.
2600;Anyway, see this movie, defnitely, but watch it with a leary eye.
2601;The movie is great, totally leading onto more spidey movies to come.
2602;The villain this movie was great living up to what he was in the comic.
2603;Fight scene are unheard of and really good.
2604;Another great thing was they didnt go overboard on the love scenes!
2605;moving from there, let me say that Sam Raimi has done a decent job in translating Spider.
2606;book legend to the silver screen, although there are a few things which have gotten in the way of a smooth transition.
2607;man comics and loved how they developed knowledge and empathy in the reader.
2608;This has been the power of Marvel Comics over many years, since those wonderful artists allowed us to actually feel what it might be like to be an extraordinary individual in a real world facing real problems.
2609;"I kept saying to myself ""Yes, yes, yes."
2610;shooter by way of Peter's intellect.
2611;I'm glad that Mr. Raimi does his best to harness the power of the comic.
2612;b. j. Thomas scene insulted me somewhat), let me say that the remaining portion of the film did a good job of redeeming it all.
2613;I appreciated how the film developed Doc Ock's character to be a bit more profound, although I scoffed somewhat at the notion of the arms as their own entities.
2614;The effects are excellent and are better this time at helping the audience believe that Peter and Spider.
2615;As an audience, we already know that it is something that Peter will always carry inside him.
2616;All in all, the film does a nice job and I look forward to seeing it again.
2617;thank you, Mr. Raimi, for doing your best!One more thing, though.
2618;climax of a superhero movie, Spider.
2619;Version numbers in the software industry are used to indicate the magnitude of changes in a product and typically indicate an improved experience.
2620;There are some interesting moments in the film but those scenes rarely elevate the product above the level of a crass marketing effort for Spider.
2621;I can only recommend it to hard core fans who have to own all the bonus featurettes, people who are exceptionally curious about the new scenes, or individuals interested in the film making process who want to see why editing makes a difference in films.
2622;the revised Train fight and Aunt May kidnapping scenes are exciting.
2623;Fans of the theatrical release aren't missing anything if they don't see these scenes but they are an improvement over the original.
2624;the dream conversation between Peter Parker and Uncle Ben was extended.
2625;sense and the new special effects featurettes are good.
2626;man comic reprint available from some retailers is a nice touch to promote the upcoming third film.
2627;Somebody on the crew must have liked this scene because one of the production stills was used in the marketing of the theatrical release.
2628;Peter's backyard meeting with Mary Jane is extended.
2629;The added dialog and delays between the line delivery ruins the intensity of the scene.
2630;It'd be a great example for a film class on how proper editing can improve a scene.
2631;All her dreams are coming true.
2632;She asks Peter how his dreams are coming along and he says he's fine.
2633;MJ asks if Peter is coming to see her play since he was always encouraging her to act .
2634;There's a side view of Peter closing the door.
2635;The camera cuts to Peter's front so you can see him pick up the pizza boxes.
2636;The perspective change is jarring and I believe the second or third cut was removed from the theatrical release and it works a lot better that way.
2637;It is a very good new character development in Spider.
2638;What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting.
2639;Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good.
2640;to be honest,the hulk had better effects and if you give it a 2nd shot,a better told story.
2641;When I saw the first part I like it, it was good, but I thought the second part was infantile.
2642;Overall I enjoyed Spiderman 2.
2643;The special effects were fantastic and the story line was still rather engaging.
2644;Overall this film is another great edition in a fantastic series.
2645;man movie was a thrill.
2646;Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here!
2647;Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film.
2648;I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter.
2649;This movie was better than the first.
2650;This is a good movie.
2651;And gets more mad at Peter and keeps on questioning him about Spider.
2652;This is one of the moments from Spider.
2653;And Octavious decides he should do the right thing.
2654;He wants to marry Peter!
2655;This is a great Superhero movie!
2656;My two favourite comic growing up was X. men and Spiderman.
2657;Stan Lee and Steve Ditka created an ageless hero.
2658;Mainly because the creative studio genuises stayed as close to the heart of who/what Spider.
2659;My husband and I enjoyed this movie very much.
2660;We have loaned it to all our children and grandchildren and they thoroughly enjoyed it also.
2661;I now have the movie back and it is going to my sister's house.
2662;I hope they like it as much as we did, and everyone out there get the movie.
2663;This is definitely in the top three greatest superhero movies ever.
2664;The first one was definitely fun and was a great superhero movie, but it did have it's faults.
2665;The story line is great.
2666;sam Raimi's style is perfect for this movie.
2667;With his direction and the casts talent and chemistry the movie works and then some.
2668;Spiderman 2 is the best film in the Spiderman series.
2669;Good special effects, an interesting villian, and a decent story come together in a film that will satisfy most actions fans.
2670;after a great title sequence, the film has a bit of a shaky start with some forced humor related to a janitor's closet but improves from there on in.
2671;Your enjoyment of this film will no doubt depend on your tolerance of Tobey Maguire's klutzy character and the continuing tease around his romance with Kirsten Dunst.
2672;man II is by far a better movie than the first.
2673;The spider man II has improved on the mistakes the first one made in such a phenomenal way, I couldn't help but watch the entire thing in awe.
2674;the animation in the movie was done superbly.
2675;It was easy on the eyes and nicely detailed to the smallest piece of glass.
2676;well she rmains to be the same old wise lady with more screen time added into the mix.
2677;But all in all the movie was solid in places I had believed it would be lacking, a great movie for marvel comic fans and newcomers.
2678;Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and company out do themselves with this epic, and raises the bar high for part 3.
2679;man film on their merits as films in a superhero film series.
2680;Thank you for your understanding.
2681;It continued an interesting story, introducing new characters and plots while building on what the first film had left us with.
2682;man's equivalent of Mr. Freeze, but with a bit more humor, and that makes him so great to watch over and over again.
2683;it showed us Peter Parker's struggles with keeping up with his double life.
2684;We surely have Toby McGuire's acting to thank for that as well as the great writing.
2685;I never really got the part about him just losing his powers and then getting them back, but otherwise, I loved this film.
2686;Nevertheless, I feel quite comfortable labeling Spider.
2687;man 2 as my favorite in this series.
2688;Doc Ock is better as a black hat in this one.
2689;I believe he came across better because you could see his facial expressions in this one.
2690;"If you like the comic
2691;I can already tell you how #3 is going to go: Harry Osborne will become the Hobgoblin.
2692;He will terrorize the town.
2693;He will develop a sense of remorse at the end (as he dies).
2694;There is some humor in the film (the scene with the brooms comes to mind), which Tobey handles very well.
2695;man 2 sure lives up to the expectations set up by the first.
2696;This movie has some great action that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2697;Very few sequels can live up to the original, but Spider.
2698;I have to say this Superbit edition is truly breathtaking with the vibrant picture detail and amazing sound.
2699;Another great thing about the Superbit edition is the choice of sound options.
2700;man 2 with the best picture and sound get the superbit edition because it blows the regular edition away.
2701;So far this is the best comic book movie ever made.
2702;i'm a big spidey fan and a bigger marvel fan.
2703;Well i'm not a movie critic and neither is my 5 yr old but my son loves it simply because its Spiderman.
2704;Spiderman 2 is his least favorite to watch tho.
2705;I ordered it and received Spiderman 1 in a Spiderman 2 case.
2706;Really, I love this film.
2707;I think it is completely amazing.
2708;And yes, it is better than the first film.
2709;infact, the thing I think is the best about this movie are the scenes showing how Peter is having to cope with all the things in his life.
2710;there are only a few action sequecnes in the film, but they are quite long and are very well thought out, such as the highlight of the movie: the train fight.
2711;still, see this movie, it is entertaining as hell, with action, romance and some comedy.
2712;The answer is yes, and SPIDERMAN 2 proves this theory true.
2713;In fact, a sequel can not only stand up to its predecessor, but be more entertaining, fun, and suspenseful than the first.
2714;Yes, it's true: SPIDERMAN 2 totally beats the first Spiderman movie.
2715;But I do think I know a good film.
2716;SPIDERMAN 2 is well worth seeing.
2717;He is more emotional and really """"becomes"""" his character, so to speak."""
2718;Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and ethereal as Mary Jane Watson.
2719;It is two years since she and Peter graduated from high school and she has pursued her dreams of acting, taking on the lead in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST.
2720;A renowned scientist experiments and the experiment not only backfires, but causes a plethora of drama, violence, and chaos as a machine he created to cheapen the expense of electricity instead hooks onto his body and gains control.
2721;I was actually a bit scared, folks, and I'm 16!
2722;It is far more suspenseful.
2723;And will she marry her fiance???
2724;I won't say between who but I'm sure you can take a wild guess.
2725;It looks like this romance shall last as well.
2726;SPIDERMAN 3 is in the works.
2727;Even more amazing special effects.
2728;Spidey flys, soars, jumps, and shoots out web like aeresol confetti.
2729;The results of pooled efforts and computer technology is an amazing sight.
2730;Peter Parker's best friend is hot.
2731;It's a great song with excellent lyrics.
2732;All the music from the movie is great, actually.
2733;The dialogue is better .
2734;The whole script is just great.
2735;It has something for everyone: suspense, drama, romance, tearjerkers, a smidgen of horror (can't get over the villain), and so much more.
2736;All around, it's a very well done effort.
2737;I enjoyed it more than the first movie, because of its actual story line.
2738;i liked the fact that the villian redeemed himself in the end.
2739;I think we need more movies like this, with the right things to fight for, instead of just beating people up, for revenge or other reasons.
2740;The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay.
2741;I just saw Spiderman 2 and I have to say that was one great movie!
2742;great effects an excellent villain.
2743;The surprise of this movie was in its amazing depth of character.
2744;"The movie's greatness comes from its ""human"" side."
2745;The first part of the movie shows how living the life of Spiderman has made Peter's life so hectic.
2746;But even more, this movie is the true love story of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, and it is a romance to remember.
2747;but this one is done perfectly.
2748;the scene at the end of the movie when Mary Jane is getting ready for her wedding to someone other than Peter is a real tear.
2749;and an amazing scene using the familiar music of the Wedding March.
2750;"For those of us old enough to recall the comic strip's beginnings and various later incarnations, ""Spiderman 2"" is the perfect tribute to Stan Lee's creation."
2751;Like its predecessor, this film skillfully balances the superhero antics of Spiderman with his struggle to be the very human Peter Parker, making for an engaging story of a man's struggle with his dual nature.
2752;much of the credit does go to the director Sam Raimi, screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the special effects technicians, and composer Danny Elfman.
2753;"Besides Maguire's brilliantly understated performance as the title character and Kirsten Dunst as love interest ""Mary Jane"", there's Rosemary Harris's truly believable ""Aunt May"", J. k. Simmons' flawless ""J. Jonah Jameson"", James Franco exorcising his own ""demons"" as ""Harry Osborn"", and Bill Nunn as Spidey supporter ""Robbie Robinson""."
2754;One of the best summer movies, of the 2004 summer movie season!
2755;man 2 was definitely worth the 2 year wait in theaters.
2756;Much more action can be seen in this movie than in the first.
2757;Sam Raimi did well in this movie, to move along the story in the Spider.
2758;Sam Raimi did well humanizing Spider.
2759;The director also does well drawing in the audience.
2760;"(See my review on the first ""Spider."
2761;Better than the first film!

2766;"I loved this movie so much
2767;I found it to be so much better then the first in many ways.
2768;Tobey Maguire was perfect as his portrayal of both Spider.
2769;Kirsten Dunst couldn't have been better"
2770;James Franco and Rosemary Harris were also fantastic as Harry Osbourne and Aunt May.
2771;the special effects were brilliant, now that web.
2772;The music was so full of excitement and vibrant energy, I remember getting so excited when I saw the trailer for this movie.
2773;The movie was suspenseful, action.
2774;I found that all the action in the movie you can see on the preview of it.
2775;For the most part I did enjoy Spidey 2.
2776;Still, the action sequences are fabulous.
2777;The villain this time is top notch!
2778;It's a love story (i. e.
2779;There is a sense of peril and doom around every corner.
2780;Spin a web, sit back and enjoy.
2781;There are not many sequels that can beat the first movie, but to me this movie is greater than the first one.
2782;I was moved to almost tears in a few scenes,especially when Harry finds out who Spidey really is and he is fighting whether to kill him or not.
2783;I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it.
2784;See this movie you will enjoy it.
2785;8 minutes is actually a lot compared to what people think is an already action.
2786;Spiderman 3 will definetly be better than the first or the second.
2787;man and if you watch the 4K mastered version they look richer, colors deeper.
2788;The trailers for this movie looked great and the reviews have been stellar.
2789;Definitely the movie of the summer whether you are a Spidey fan or not.
2790;As most reviews have pointed out, the storyline is very well developed.
2791;Peter Parker struggles with complexities of living a dual life.
2792;I will however, make some comments about what I particularly liked or disliked about this film.
2793;among the things I liked most was the beginning of the movie, which was very clever in the way that it showed you storyboards from the 1st movie to refresh your memory and summarize what has happened.
2794;And the storyline is very well developed.
2795;In addition to these, there was also a good mix of humour thrown in to make the movie even more entertaining (eg.
2796;this is a great movie to see with the family and I hope that it breaks many box office records.
2797;That's it for now Spidey fans!
2798;I do read the Spidey comics, and I must say that the Doc Ock presented in Spidey 2 was a lot more fun and entertaining then the one in the comic.
2799;His arms are more realistic looking, and the technology more believable.
2800;I thought super heroes always just kept their powers.
2801;"Oh well
2802;The spidey scenes flowing through the city and fighting are amazing.

2817;Sequals like this one, X2: X. men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common.
2818;"Beyond just being a ""sequal"", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way."

2822;There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book.
2823;I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it.
2824;man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time.
2825;This movie was a fine achievement.
2826;Is it as great as the first one's?
2827;The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable.
2828;This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.
2829;release, making this the best available version of the film on the market.
2830;what a great film too.
2831;acting, action, emotions, all added up to a great film.
2832;one that very well may become a true classic!
2833;Tobey, Kirsten, Alfred are all superb in their roles, and Sam Raimi does one hell of a job directing this masterpiece.
2834;I cant wait for SM2it will be the best comic book movie yet.
2835;I enjoyed this movie very much as I have others in this series, I will do business with this company again.
2836;There's a lot to like here.
2837;rate special effects, a coming.
2838;age theme, a great villain, capable directing.
2839;a fun romp, worth seeing anyway.
2840;The emphasis is almost always on a bankable star, flashy special effects, and elaborate confrontations with super villains.
2841;SPIDERMAN 2 lacks none of these things, but luckily it has a great deal more going for it.
2842;More than anything else, SPIDERMAN 2 has a great story.
2843;"Somewhere along the line, the other superhero movies lost track of the story
2844;i do not think that it is any exaggeration to say that this is the finest superhero movie ever made, and the primary reason for that is the super screenplay.
2845;Film mastermind Sam Raimi obviously recognized that while special effects and stars are great enhancements to a film, at root you have to have a story worth the telling.
2846;I found the first film to be mildly interesting, but the vast improvement in the second film over the first is overwhelmingly because of the greatly improved storyline.
2847;Yeah, he is a superhero, but his life really and truly sucks, and in super fashion.
2848;And all this takes place as he has to face a new and dangerous enemy in Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose body and mind has been taken over by intelligent high.
2849;tech tentacles (played marvelously by superb character actor Alfred Molina).
2850;luckily, the film excels not only in setting up the situation, but does an excellent job of resolving the central concepts in the storyline.
2851;I love this one as good as the first and it was amazing!
2852;Oh My god Sam Riami knows his stuff!
2853;i just hope The Third one will be just as good.
2854;Tobey Maguire does an admirable job capturing that dilemna.
2855;the nemesis this time is Doc Ock, played with enormous composure and then terrific high.
2856;There are also a lot of inaccuracies.
2857;My problem with the film is the incredibly sl.
2858;Even the comic scenes, which could have been so funny.
2859;doorman, the awkwardness of his elevator ride with the rich dog.
2860;however, as pure mind candy, and for anyone who followed Spider.
2861;man in the comic books, this is still worth seeing!
2862;This is an excelent sequel as a movie and an excelent sequel as a gift set to Spider.
2863;The casing is more compact to the one in the first movie, but items enclosed are top notch like the first one.
2864;One of the best second installment in movie history, as good as """"The Godfather part II"""", """"Terminator 2"""" and """"Toy Story 2""""."""
2865;defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way.
2866;"a. week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love?That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in ""Spiderman 2,"" a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow."
2867;day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people .
2868;most especially the girl he loves.
2869;"It is this added intellectual dimension that gives ""Spiderman 2"" the thematic heft that ""Spiderman 1"" lacked."
2870;the plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche.
2871;The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around.
2872;A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.
2873;as Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective.
2874;effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through.
2875;The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self.
2876;assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue.
2877;"i wasn't a big fan of the first ""Spiderman"" movie, but ""Spiderman 2"" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist."
2878;Raimi may have struck out the first time around, but he has managed to hit a homer .
2879;My son loves this movie, I have bought multiple super hero and transformer movies as I have learned that he loves them.
2880;I love the time we spend together watching them.
2881;They did a good job.
2882;some classic moments that stick with me: Peter Parker's frenzied attempt to make a timely pizza delivery, while fighting crime at the same time.
2883;The most dramatic scenes involved Dr Octopus and Spider.
2884;man 3 will be just as good.
2885;fi, would recommend it, worth it, toby maguire special, suspenseful, very entertaining, great music, fun story line
2886;Yet this could easily be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.
2887;sM2 picks up 2 years after the last movie.
2888;Both Harry Osborn and MJ have moved on with their lives (and don't dodge foreclosure like Spidey has to).
2889;Hey, is Darkman mean?Though a special effects treat, SM2 flies on the strength of Tobey Maguire's understated performance, it also rides the steam of the other players .
2890;jokes yet slick enough for the non.
2891;fan who doesn't even know that superhero is one word, SM2 is a rare treat.
2892;Best of all, SM2 stays true to the every joe.
2893;a good example being the scene when the arms of the near.
2894;ock come alive and tear up an OR.
2895;If you've got an 8 year.
2896;He has a love for MJ that he can't share with her, he has a conflict with his best male friend who beleives that Peter is protecting the identity of the man who killed his father, not knowing his dad was the evil Green Goblin.
2897;(which is refreshing real as opposed to the huge lofts or suites that movie characters always seem to have in cities with a high cost of living despite the lack of a discernable job or other means of income.)
2898;What insues is an intersting character study of a honest young man with a gift that he didn't ask for and a resulting life that is complicated to say the least.
2899;The effects and visual are great and there is a definite stylistic mood of a Spiderman movie which is urgent and foreboding yet somehow warm, never feeling over the the top.
2900;It's cute and a nice little relief from Peter's battles on the streets and within himself.)
2901;Though conflicted you can feel that at his core he is a grounded, solid person who is ultimately lead by a desire to do the right thing.
2902;While many movie heroes fall into the judge/jury/executioner mode, Peter stays above that led by his heart rather than his powers or raw emotions.
2903;MJ, while now successful with modeling and a budding career on Broadway, has not let her looks and fame turn her vain or shallow.
2904;She remains down to earth, open, and very likeable.
2905;aunt May is also refreshing as a strong woman who despite still grieving the loss of her husband has come through it as a positive, affirming, and loving person.
2906;Even Doc Oct has a loving relationship with his wife early in the picture before the perfunctory accident changes him into a villian.
2907;overall, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves.
2908;I would recommend it if you liked the first movie or enjoy the super hero genre in general.
2909;One of the highest review movies by the experts.
2910;Yes, the special effects are better and the love story angle is still very intriguing.
2911;establishing the love story line and Spidey's attempt to forgo his career.
2912;I really liked the movie and recommend it strongly.
2913;They do end with a great lead.
2914;We all know how great Spiderman 2 was, it included one of the classic villains from the comic in an excellent adaptation of the original story delivering a movie that was indeed better than the first one.
2915;Mary Jane talks about love and the kiss she got from Spidey with a friend.
2916;"Two fight sequences are extended
2917;line, the extra 8 minutes do not add anything to the movie"
2918;"the movie includes a trivia track with a lot of information about the comics, the actors and the movie itself
2919;There is a sneak peek for the """"Spider."""
2920;man 2 was amazing in so many ways.
2921;actors, costumes, action sequences, music, props, sets, etc.
2922;He is also kind of a dork, but in the nice sense.
2923;"he keeps him human
2924;i also found it very moving when Peter was struggling to do the right thing.
2925;his jobs, college, and the people he loves.
2926;but astonishingly, turns around and walks away.
2927;This scene was poignant to me for two reasons: we have already seen that Peter has made up his mind, but we also see the internal struggle.
2928;the music in this movie was great, and the music for each scene was well.
2929;The special effects were absolutely brilliant!
2930;man swinging through NYC are still realistic.
2931;With great power comes great responsibility.
2932;he has to be willing to give up so much.
2933;man, and is happy for a while, but we soon see that he needs to be Spider.
2934;Like it or not, he has a responsibility to the people of New York City, and the people of NYC have a need for a hero, and we see this in several moving ways.
2935;the rhetoric of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin in the first movie is trumped by the wise words of Aunt May.
2936;a true hero"
2937;this movie speaks to all of us.
2938;we each have talents, and we should use those talents for good (for the good of all mankind, as Dr. Octavius spoke of intelligence), and choose to do what is right, even if is hard to do.
2939;this movie is the perfect combination of what I think is a must.
2940;choosing to do good over the comforts of life, great actors, believable characters, moving music, awesome special effects, good jokes, incredibly cool costumes and a great storyline.
2941;If you haven't seen it, go see it now while it's still in theaters, and if you've already seen it, take friends or family to see it.
2942;either way, see it again!
2943;and though it ends on an ominous note, I'll end on a positive one.
2944;this sets the bar incredibly high for Spider.
2945;man team is up to the challenge, and I look forward to seeing Spider.
2946;This, along with the first Spider Man movie, is the best super hero movie ever.
2947;this is one of those rare action flicks where the hero is actually more interesting than the villan.
2948;Seeing him tear up over seeing Mary Jane with another man damn near made me tear up.
2949;Okay, it did make me tear up.
2950;one of the most moving moments of the film is when Spider Man is finally recognized as a hero by the passengers on the L. train.
2951;Powerful comic book/mythological stuff!And the light touches are great, too!
2952;the soundtrack is great as well.
2953;Danny Elfman is in top form, and the song selection is as fitting as any Scorcece(sp?)
2954;based movie as it should be done.
2955;His love and respect for the comic books that these films are based on shines through like no other super hero movies that have been brought to the silver screen.
2956;fide unrequitted love story here.
2957;Coming on the heels of a success like Spider.
2958;It worked well enough for the movie, and since the Goblin was basically a man unhinged anyways.
2959;The fight sequences are intricate, large and fast.
2960;If you want to, great.
2961;man 2 is one of the best sequels ever and the best superhero movies ever.
2962;Heck, it's one of the best movies too.
2963;disc Widescreen Edition)but it is one of the best comic book adapations ever put on the screen.
2964;The movie shows more character development, and the visual effects are more stunning than the first.
2965;It is definately the best sequel I have ever seen.
2966;I bought the special edition as well.
2967;The new scenes are cool.
2968;well, that's the sort of film this is.
2969;Be true to your heart, Octavius urges.
2970;and he works as a computer artists' helper to make sure what they do looks OK!
2971;man 2 is one of the best comic book films ever made.
2972;The story is well crafted and executed with great force by the director, visual effects advisors, and the strong cast.
2973;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are given more material to work with and give superior performances than in the first film.
2974;And Alfred Molina gives a great supporting performance as Doc Oc.
2975;this is definitely a film that should be looked at as more than comic book adventure and more of a well written and well made film.
2976;well if your reading this i obviously got your attention.
2977;anyways i really enjoyed this movie it dosent have some of the witty jokes and laughs like in the first one this is more serouis.
2978;great family movie.youll love even thou if u havent seen the first one.
2979;man saga is likely to be the crown jewel of the series, a blend of comic fantasy and human realism that satisfies action addicts just enough while exploring duality and classist society as well as the original Star Wars trilogy.
2980;in Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst director Sam Raimi has a couple that transcends the genre: They are not their generation's best actors .
2981;bright, humble, hopeful, just a smidge goofy .
2982;are perfectly attuned to this fare.
2983;man 2 works on other levels, but mostly because Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are kids we'd be proud to know (or raise), played by actors who still seem closer to Earth than Hollywood.
2984;The accident leaves Octavious at the behest of the giant, powerful mechanical arms, who immediately want to recreate the experiment by any means necessary.
2985;He's late to Mary Jane's play.
2986;He's on the outs with his Aunt May (an excellent Rosemary Harris).
2987;"alvin Sargent's screenplay understands what issues withstand the opening weekend box office
2988;An excellent dying with pride spech from Harris argues for duty against dream.
2989;hour comic book, yet firmly rooted in working.
2990;Notice that Jonah pits both sides against each other for what he believes to be maximum effect while the masses embrace Spider.
2991;For bright, receptive teens, Spider.
2992;man 2 carries an excellent message.
2993;i see your eyes widening.
2994;don't say no, I was with most of you in the theatre and heard it myself.
2995;if you have any sense of dignity for your gender , or the men for their wives, daughters, girlfreinds, you will come to see there is truth to what I say.
2996;It got here in record time.
2997;After hearing everyone rave about how much better this movie was than the first one I was very excited to go see it.
2998;I loved the first movie.
2999;Spiderman has always been one of my favorite comic book heroes and the first movie was, while not true to the """"T"""" for the comic book, an excellent rendition."""
3000;The only reason people are saying this is better than the first is due to the better special effects and action scenes.
3001;Meanwhile, a brilliant scientist is transformed into a monster trouble maker by his own invention.
3002;He becomes Doc Oc, a human being with four additional mechanical arms, the perfect counterfeit to the real Spiderman.
3003;As scary as the first, amazing special effects, looks just like the comic books.
3004;Great casting for the director who's hardly ever directed.
3005;This is such a great movie.
3006;It is very well done.
3007;"When you really get right down to it, it only makes sense that for the first true silver screen outing of everyone's favorite ""friendly neighborhood Spider."
3008;(Okay, so the film makers will probably take the cartoon's route.)
3009;The extra scenes added in this version are great to say the least.
3010;There are also a few really funny scenes that will have you rolling.
3011;The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.
3012;man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.
3013;This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.
3014;One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.
3015;man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.
3016;The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.
3017;Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.
3018;raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.
3019;The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.
3020;average teenager who's given an incredible ability.
3021;And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.
3022;As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.
3023;In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.
3024;There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft.
3025;quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.
3026;But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.
3027;overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.
3028;man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.
3029;Spiderman 2 is an incredible movie.
3030;"It manages to remain true to the original Stan Lee character, uses amazing CG and special effects, and yet the movie is deeply human
3031;if you want to see a film that's fun, with lots of action, plenty of heroes and villains, see Spiderman 2.
3032;Spider Man 2 is probably a good reminder that I should not read movie reviews before checking out a flick.
3033;Roger Ebert, as I recall, has dubbed """"SM2"""" the best comic."""
3034;SM2 opens with an imaginative comic.
3035;Mary Jane, now a successful actress, still carries a torch for Parker and suspects that he is Spider Man, but is turned off by Parker's perpetual demonstrations of indifference.
3036;Still, Molina offers several touching scenes and gives the best performance in the movie.
3037;the action scenes are fantastic, and are much improved over the first film, which had a slightly cartoonish air to it.
3038;There are several scenes to marvel at, and make the movie worth seeing all on their own.
3039;Both films are pretty family.
3040;But both films go to great lengths to include shots of voluptuous women in clingy clothing . . . and this is just jarring.
3041;shot of the lovely Ms. Dunst.
3042;"a special effects bonanza and a decent story (as well as its other dubious ""features"" make ""Spider Man 2"" a perfect film for boys aged 10.15."
3043;to begin with, I enjoyed this movie more than the first one in every category.
3044;I could relate with Parker's emotions on a higher level than the first movie.
3045;This time, the plot surrounded Peter Parker, played by Toby Maguire, going through the days with his ongoing struggle as he leads on a double life.
3046;From there, we meet Dr. Otto Octavious, a good hearted scientist that wants to create a new type of fusion energy.
3047;At the same time, he has created four mechanical arms, able to work with the reaction which he straps onto his body.
3048;From there, the movie becomes a dazzling spectacle of directing at its finest.
3049;Despite the action sequences being amazing, Sam Raimi does a magnificent job of making them believable, and not overdoing them either.
3050;There is still a lot of focus on Peter Parker, which makes this the most accurate and best comic book adaptation to date.
3051;Toby Maguire is now an even more believable Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane.
3052;Willem Dafoe was great as the Green Goblin in the first Spider.
3053;I imagined the fantastic possibilities of the use of the mechanical arms in combat, and while I felt my thoughts were creative, the fight scenes in this movie were better than I could have imagined.
3054;An amazing combat sequence atop a speeding train is among my favorite sequences, but there are others, and I won't go into detail of them.
3055;I can tell you though, I was very pleased.
3056;it seems director Sam Raimi has hit a homerun with this one.
3057;Improving upon the first installment in every category, it seems Sam Raimi has finally found his groove.
3058;The film sets up a third installment, and all I can say is that I literally can't wait.
3059;man 2 combines everything that a comic book movie should be to create an exhilarating ride that shouldn't be missed by any movie watcher.
3060;It improves on the first in almost every way, except for explosions.
3061;The first had more explosions but this one has much better fight sequences, that are intense and very well choreographed, esspecially the clock tower and train fight.
3062;This one also has a better performance from Tobey(who is definetly goin places) who shows he could be the best new actor out there besides Colin Farrel maybe.
3063;This ones also very funny and made me laugh more then any stupid comedy out there(comedies suck).
3064;man 2, Batman Begins, and the first Superman movie.
3065;"man 2 have something in common
3066;As comic book fans, they obviously knew what they were doing when they penned this fantastic sequel that surpasses the original at almost every turn.
3067;man is Marvel's most popular character and the icon for it's company.
3068;man is the hero that everyone can relate to.
3069;man is a hero with realistic problems that everyone has and goes through.
3070;He gets fired from his job for always being late.
3071;He's late to watch Mary Jane in her play.
3072;And, yet again, the audience can relate to his character.
3073;The movie works so well because it focuses on Peter Parker instead of Spider.
3074;Batman Begins works because it focuses on Bruce Wayne instead of Batman.
3075;And Smallville is a hit show because it focuses Clark Kent.
3076;Audiences now want and demand rich and interesting characters.
3077;time!Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.
3078;He mirrors Peter Parker from the comic book so well.
3079;Part of that tribute has to go to director Sam Raimi who is one of the biggest Spider.
3080;He still has a poster of Spider.
3081;Tobey is able to humanize Peter to such an extent that we share his joy and his pain.
3082;Tobey has also mastered the ability to communicate the feelings of Peter with a simple look.
3083;He's wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.
3084;He is not as much a personal nemesis as the Green Goblin, but he has a great intelligence.
3085;the special effects are much better in this film than the last.
3086;as a former comic book reader for nearly fifteen years, it's wonderful to see this fun character come to life on the big screen.
3087;As I said, most everyone can relate to Spider.
3088;Needless to say, this one passed all of my expectations.
3089;A better villian, better story and superb acting across the board elevated this from being just a """"superhero movie"""" to one of the best films that I have ever seen."""
3090;I even convinced my wife, who didn't like to first one to see it with me after I went on opening day, and she liked it as well.
3091;I'm not sure how they can top this one for Spider.
3092;It had more talking and thinking, and blended that with some action and fighting and pulled it off very well.
3093;It was interesting to see Spider.
3094;This made the movie vary a little from the first, which was good.
3095;But overall it was good movie, and I would recommend that you watch it if you want to see a good movie or if you liked the first one.
3096;The second sequel in the Spider Man series, is gareteed to keep you asking for more.
3097;This movie has much more action and intrigue than Spider Man 1, but moves a little slower.
3098;However if you enjoyed the first Spider Man you will love the next!
3099;J. k. Simmons is a joy to watch as he nails the J. Jonah Jameson character .
3100;his scenes are the best in the movie .
3101;The action scenes did the best job I've ever seen of capturing the feel of comic book action sequence.
3102;i love Sam Raimi's work as a rule.
3103;Commercially, he has another hit here.
3104;It's the humanity in this movie that makes it worth watching.
3105;It's the undying love that Peter has and his sense of duty that make it totally Oscar.
3106;For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House.
3107;This is really a good sequal!!!
3108;i thought the acting was great(especially from Tobey as Peter/Spidey and Alfred as Doc Ock)the storyline was really good and the action scenes were jaw.
3109;overall,THIS is the greatest comic book movie,This is the perfecct sequal to the first,and THIS is the film to see this summer.
3110;This is one of the few times that the sequel out shines the original.
3111;Alfred Molina gives a great performance as Doc Octopus and the special effects are simply amazing.
3112;If you liked the first Spideman, you will love this one.
3113;give this one a try, it's better and i just saw the third one.
3114;There was nothing Amazing or Spectacular in the Web of Spider.
3115;man 2 tries to be an action movie, a comedy, a romance and an art house film all at once.
3116;the posters and the trailers feature big action sequences between Spider.
3117;He loves his aunt and would do anything for her.
3118;Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the confident young man of the first movie and the comics who took his problems in stride.
3119;"James Franco is clearly frustrated here
3120;as a longtime comic fan I anxiously anticipated seeing Spider.
3121;man 2 and Peter Parker is one of the best I've seen in years.
3122;Ms. Dunst and Mr. Molina and others in this Movie all did a Great Job.
3123;I recommend this Movie whole.
3124;heartedly to everyone that still believes in Heros.
3125;Keep it up because this is one Spidey Fan that Loved this Movie.
3126;He's in love w/ his childhood friend, but feels that allowing himself to be a part of her life will endanger her because he has enemies.
3127;this film is full of contradictions.
3128;A miniture version of our own sun is tossed into the Hudson River to extinguish it, and while it glows yellow.
3129;The action scenes are beautiful and exciting to watch .
3130;clever choreography and a lot of really funny moments where the film doesn't take itself too seriously.
3131;The movie definitely sets itself up for a sequel on many fronts.
3132;Will we see a new Dr. Octopus .
3133;The special effects in the movie was great through amazon streaming.
3134;It's a good movie and it's convenient way to access movie on many devices
3135;man to the silver screen and boy was i empressed with Sam Raimi's directing and David Koepps screenplay with enough action and humor to keep cinema goers happy, an intelligent script, powerfull acting and classful diecting to keep film buffs pleaased and of course a respectful adaptation to impress the comic book fans.
3136;do something with a big glowing machine.
3137;mAN 2 that I have to say I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies with a better sense of pace.
3138;the action scenes do perk things up, especially when Maguire and Molina fight on a moving train, and although I'm not a fan of digital effects I thought they were well blended in here.
3139;It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.
3140;effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train.
3141;Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.
3142;James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high.
3143;But being a Spidey fan I thought what the heck.
3144;This is a whole new movie.
3145;The added scenes to the movie actually improves on the theater version.
3146;The closest thing I have ever come across something like this is the Teddy Rawling's Alien 3 Cut.
3147;It is a whole new cut and elevates the original movie.
3148;another example is the first fight with Doc Oct.
3149;The extended version shows the fight taking place from the high rise buildings and continues inside an office.
3150;This is a great piece of work!
3151;I gave it one star because, admittedly the special effects for Doctor Octopus are pretty cool and the humor of Jameson is fairly amusing as well.
3152;The only reason I saw it was because of how great everyone said it was.
3153;Whatever they saw in it that made it """"great"""", I did not."""
3154;Peter Parker's friend and him seem to be strangely close, almost gay with each other, while Parker avoids Mary Jane and wonders why she's dissapointed with him.
3155;lastly, it was very non believable.
3156;man you had some moments that were kind of believable.
3157;The action scenes were excellent.
3158;The over all story was good.
3159;I liked this movie and I think anyone who liked the first will like the second more.
3160;This film is much, much better.
3161;Technically, this film is a masterpiece.
3162;The is a culmination of Director Sam Raimi's career.
3163;This is probably the best comic book movie of all time.
3164;If you've seen the trailer, and you thought that the movie going to be cool.
3165;This movie is anything beyong cool.
3166;I love how the movie team work on making such amazing effects(Spiderman's paradigm is the favorite effect I like about this movie) I also LOVE the story so much.
3167;There are some surprise you never thought would happend!
3168;I am sooooo satisfied with these surprise!
3169;LOL~~This second movie also have very good sense of humor than the first one.
3170;Everything I see in this movie is POSITIVE.
3171;By far one of the greatest super.
3172;Now it's even more worth it to get this set with an even better movie inside.
3173;man fan and I really loved both of these movies.
3174;This one had incredible special effects.
3175;The acting was at it's best and the story.
3176;line is very well done.
3177;Just enough action, just enough drama.
3178;man movie I was completely blown away, and I'm sure once you see it you'll be blown away too.
3179;It is so much better than the first movie.
3180;It was a Christmas gift.
3181;I love Spiderman, have since I was a child and I love him more and more with every movie, series and game that comes out.
3182;This movie is just as engaging as the first, yet is much more interesting than the first.
3183;i would also get the game with this, it is just as entertaining and addictive as the movie is.
3184;Enjoy one of the best movies of 2004!
3185;Spider Man 2 FAR surpasses the first Spider Man movie and is quite possibly the best Superhero film ever made!The movie begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) showing up late to work.
3186;It's quite easy to see what the film is trying to tell you right off the bat!
3187;throughout the first half of the movie you see what being Spider.
3188;He's portrayed brilliantly and as the film goes to show, his coming about is merely an accident.
3189;the characters are developed very nicely.
3190;but among all the characters, Peter Parker is perhaps the most well developed.
3191;man the film shows how he has to go through a great deal with his struggles among friends.
3192;by far Spider Man 2 is the most breathtaking Super Hero film ever crafted.
3193;it's a grand film that no one should miss.
3194;Truly a great accomplishment in Cinema.
3195;See it and love it, Spider Man 2 is a movie that takes off and never comes back down!
3196;"I can now add an easy third to my list, and ""Spider."
3197;"man 2"" is, without a doubt, that third movie."
3198;His one true love Mary Jane (Dunst) is now a Broadway actress and model, her face plastered on billboards and posters everywhere.
3199;time to throw a superb supervillain into the mix.
3200;"Fanboys will be especially proud of director Sam Raimi's homage to the comic, the shot of Peter depositing the Spidey suit into an alley dumpster taken directly from a panel in Issue #50 entitled ""Spider."
3201;"man 2"" gets dipped in a vat of serious drama, allowing every actor to really show their wares."
3202;"toe with tarantulas, Molina is certainly familiar with arachnids and the atmosphere of the ""Spider."
3203;"man"" set suit him well."
3204;He eats the lens as Doc Ock, playing the character with a combination of zeal and earnestness.
3205;top theatrics as the Green Goblin, Molina is a breath of fresh air and gives Doc Ock something very important .
3206;James Franco is excellent this second time around as Harry Osborn, his bitterness towards Spider.
3207;winning actress's dramatic prowess manifested in her scenes with Maguire.
3208;the film ends once again on a climactic note, setting the stage for a spectacular sequel and you'll have a pretty good idea which villain will make an appearance.
3209;"Let us hope so, because if ""Spider."
3210;"man 2"" is a promise of an even greater film to come, we're all in for a real treat!"
3211;man)this film should be the biggest blockbuster of the summer.
3212;Spiderman 2 is a great sequel that brings back the wonder, drama and adventure that made the original such a great film and does it better in every aspect.
3213;Toby Maguire, Kristen Dunst, and Alfred Molina give great performances and give this sequel an emotional edge over the original and Sam Raimi goes for the jugular in the drama as well.
3214;It's very rare that a sequel is able out do the original but this one does it in spades.
3215;It was well worth the wait.
3216;This is quite enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fictional heroic movies (i. e. everything from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings).
3217;I absolutely love movies with three dimensional villains.
3218;hero movies have villains that are simple and easy to understand.
3219;man movie was a good step away from this, but I don't think we saw enough of his personal struggle against the Goblin.
3220;i also thought that the transformations that Peter went through were very interesting to watch, and there were many scenes that had nice touches.
3221;I also loved the introduction of more characters that play parts in Spider.
3222;Oh well, it's just a movie and as such was very good.
3223;"man 2"" as the greatest superhero movie ever made."
3224;I was a bit underwhelmed with the original film although it was pleasing enough and I was happy to see my all.
3225;book icon swing onto the silver screen, but I did predict that this series of films could improve with time as the core elements were all there, but I never ever thought they would produce such a fantastic film as this one.
3226;The original cast, which was great, returns bringing more depth to their roles.
3227;Tobey was great as Peter Parker, but his voice.
3228;The CGI effects are enormously improved upon and now very believable.
3229;acting of Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin villain is brushed aside with this new villain that is marvelously played by Alfred Molina.
3230;We honestly like this guy when we meet him and feel great empathy for his disasterous turn.
3231;The effects involving his character are perhaps the best ever created for a comic.
3232;i do not know how they will top this one, but this is arguably the very best comic.
3233;It leaves the audience wanting more and that is the highest compliment any audience or reviewer can say about a film.
3234;I thought it was a great movie.
3235;I'm sure a good kid with superpowers would turn his back on someone getting pummeled.
3236;"man has always been my favorite comic book hero because he was a ""regular guy"" like the rest of us."
3237;hero stuff and downplay the human element of Spider.
3238;man that I always thought was so important.
3239;this movie, like the first, has tons of heart, like a good super.
3240;hero movie should, like Spider.
3241;For all the above, I give this movie my highest rating .
3242;What baffles me is that so many people thought this was the best superhero movie of all time and I just can't see what's go good about it.
3243;the story of course is Peter Parker having troubles between his regular life and the life of a superhero.
3244;We attended the first film with great enthusiasm.
3245;We grew up reading the comics, and looked forward to seeing a great adventure not unlike those we read about in our younger years.
3246;mAN 2 proves to be everything the first film was not.
3247;in the previous film, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was a wonderful blend of adolescent angst and heroism.
3248;Parker as Parker was wonderful.
3249;the Peter Parker of part 2 is still very much the same.
3250;man of part 2, refreshingly, carries the same qualities.
3251;The embarrassing part of life has found its way into the superhero's web.
3252;He?s a decent man, and like Parker, struggles to do the right thing, albeit through villainous means.
3253;the writing this time around has hit its mark as well.
3254;This time around, the goofiness has a charm all its own.
3255;the screenplay is the movie's real joy.
3256;Parker's character arc is delightfully bereft of nonsensical musings and desire.
3257;His course to make his dreams come true is as real as ours is.
3258;Harry Osborne's character is also much improved over the first film, as he demonstrates the slow decay that hate inevitably brings.
3259;i expected this film two years ago, and I have finally received my wish.
3260;Granted, this is a comic book movie, and not to be taken seriously.
3261;But for those of us who enjoy butter on our popcorn as opposed to cheese, this movie delivers where its predecessor had not.
3262;The Seller described this to us and it was just that.
3263;man but still a good movie. . . . . . . . . .
3264;I liked Spiderman 2 even better than Spiderman 1.
3265;The second disk that was a documentary about the making of Spiderman was great too.
3266;It was fun seeing all the blue screen stuff too.
3267;Spiderman 2 is an above OK sequel but that's all about it.
3268;There isnt one speical remarkable moment I can think of in the movie.
3269;The same goes for Tim Burton's Batman returns but the movie was simply beautiful enough for me to watch again and again.
3270;Should be a good flick, looking forward to July.
3271;They started the year off with a great adult oriented movie call the Punisher.
3272;Next in line is Blade Trinity.
3273;Spiderman in my eyes was one of the best movies ever made, for any genre.
3274;This movie is so much more than the previous one.
3275;Doctor Octopus is the coolest super villain I've ever seen, and even cooler in a movie.
3276;The love story between Peter and Mary Jane Watson grows intensely in the sequel, and it makes you wonder how well it will work in the next movie.
3277;I recommend each and every one of you superhero fans because you won't be disappointed.
3278;The attention to detail in this movie was awesome.
3279;Every actor really brought personality to their character.
3280;Danny elfman was a perfect choice to do the soundtrack.
3281;I also liked they didn't switch actors and had left the door open for a lot more future movies.
3282;This to me is one of the best sequels I have ever seen.
3283;alfred molina is great as Doc Ock.
3284;and the special effects are spectacular
3285;details today and this sounds like the best version of the film to get.
3286;The box is a black with webbing background, with the image from the final release poster (Spider.
3287;the movie itself is up there as one of the best sequels in recent memory.
3288;"Right up there with ""The Godfather part II"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Terminator 2"", and ""Aliens""."
3289;man, convinced that New York's popular web.
3290;slinger has done nothing to Peter but brought emotional pain to his family and friends and destroyed his life as a whole.
3291;with great power comes great responsibility.
3292;but, at what cost?The film has quite a few memorable moments both dramatically, as well as action (the film doesn't drag).
3293;The scene where Peter finally confesses to his Aunt what happened the day of his Uncle's death is one of the more powerful and heartbreaking in the film.
3294;The SFX are leaps and bounds above the first film.
3295;The subway battle is the best in the series so far and the bank heist fight isn't too shabby either.
3296;But, this is your chance to get one of the best films of 2004 in a deluxe box set.
3297;It's got my favorite Spider.
3298;this has the most awesome super hero fight scenes and the best dangling old lady scene I've seen in a while.
3299;But when there wasn't plot, it picked right back up into cars being thrown.
3300;This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made.
3301;It outshines the 2001 original.
3302;The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved.
3303;The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch.
3304;The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City.
3305;The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character.
3306;The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero.
3307;Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc.
3308;The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations.
3309;I am a huge fan of the first and eagerly anticipated this one.
3310;I know that this was an important part in the comic, but they could have made the segment a little shorter.
3311;Spiderman 2 was a HUGE success.
3312;Although the first movie showed how much fun Parker was having, the second movie goes into detail on how the super powers can take its toll on the young guy.
3313;Can't win them all the time!
3314;And probably the biggest pressure is one that gets us all, love.
3315;And the ironic twist is that he is also Parker's best buddy, who could have seen that coming?All in all, this is a fantastic movie, dont listen to that idiot who says that the two moives suck, they are anything but bad.
3316;The special effects are brilliant, and it truly is one of the best superhero movie ever made.
3317;Lots of intense fight scenes, my favorite one being on the train, and an emotional decision by Dr. Octopus at the end are fantastic.
3318;and did I mention the fact that Tobey McGuire gives an absolutely credible performance as the nerd by day Parker, and the awsome spiderman by night?
3319;What is it with Marvel comic flicks and teary.
3320;eyed cheesiness?I feel like watching this film again just so I can count the times that each character in the film has tears welled up in their eyes.
3321;"For a real comic book movie, check out George Clooney in the awesome ""Batman and Robin."""
3322;man, and I loved it.
3323;After viewing this film, I was able to place all the in the proper perspective: Some people simply don't know anything about Spider.
3324;For the most part, this movie is pretty true to form.
3325;the tape came in very good condition and well packaged tha
3326;Now I saw this movie, more action, fights, love.
3327;I honestly don't know if the second one will be any better, but there is hope!
3328;If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories.
3329;There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space.
3330;so, keep your hopes up folks!
3331;Thanks to Michael Chabon, the second film just might be a very good one.
3332;On the upside, great special effects.
3333;I also hope that the writers will lighten up a bit and put some fun back in the movies.
3334;Spiderman 2 is pretty good .
3335;we meet the Professor that probably becomes the Lizard later on in the franchise, and there's an absolutely fabulous scene where Harry discovers his dad's Green Goblin laboratory.
3336;We even got to see slightly more of the girl who becomes the Black Cat.
3337;MaGuire does a good job of demonstrating angst, and Dunst makes MJ stronger than she was in the first one.
3338;But it's a good way to spend a couple of hours, and makes some good points.
3339;a great action thriller, its a great escape for 2 hrsi love this movie
3340;man 2 is a great action movie, one which rises above the usual superhero movie.
3341;Though I enjoy comic book movie franchises, Spiderman is my least favorite.
3342;The one reason I went to see the movie was because of the magnificent music on the trailers.
3343;But, we'll have to see.
3344;This is by far one of the best super hero movies ever to be made.
3345;Awesome special effects, an intelligent movie, a great action movie.
3346;And Sam Raimi is our chosen one.
3347;He has a chance to improve his whole life, but bad timing.
3348;He comes back for one final battle with Octavius and realizes that Spiderman is his life and he could not live with himself if he just let offenders go unpunished.
3349;I'm sure plenty of people will hear that when they hear people talk about this movie, and what can I say except that it's true.
3350;Spiderman 2 has joined that rare pantheon of films that are actually better than the original: Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, and Dawn of the Dead to name a few (and the last one's stretching it).
3351;He must have a bet going with Jude Law to see who can be in more films.
3352;Of course, he does a fine job in this film, and must be a really good actor because I didn't recognize I had seen him previously in about fifty movies, he just blends into the character.
3353;everyone does an excellent job in this film (except for Kirstin Dunst.
3354;Tobe Maguire is able to play these extremes confidently and sells us the character in both scenes.
3355;the biggest strength of this film is that Sam Raimi is able to mesh together so many genres without it seeming jarring.
3356;adventure, cartoon, monster movie, and none feels forced or out of place.
3357;The aforementioned montage to Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head is perhaps the biggest risk the film takes, but the film makers are so confident that it works perfectly.
3358;It is easily the funniest part of the film.
3359;what makes the Spiderman films in general so great is that Sam Raimi really believes that these characters have depth.
3360;I saw this at the midnight showing and was kind of tired (but I drank some coffee) and loved it.
3361;This movie is great and has the most breathtaking action scenes.
3362;This is way better than the 1st Spider.
3363;This has cool action and I gotta admit, I was laughing a lot at the jokes, pretty much: cool movie, cool action, funny jokes.
3364;I loved this movie so much, I went to see it another time and liked it even more.
3365;This is a masterpiece and is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life.
3366;Spiderman 2 is a great sequel that brings back the wonder, drama and adventure that made the original such a great film and does it better in every aspect.
3367;Toby Maguire, Kristen Dunst, and Alfred Molina give great performances and give this sequel an emotional edge over the original and Sam Raimi goes for the jugular in the drama as well.
3368;It's very rare that a sequel is able out do the original but this one does it in spades.
3369;It was well worth the wait.
3370;true to the comic series.
3371;packed and well worth the money.
3372;man III and Peter Parker can start acting like a confident young man soon.
3373;This is such an improvement on the first film.
3374;this film is simply flawless.
3375;I felt like I was living the comic book.
3376;I'm happy to report, are strong characters and honest feelings.
3377;I give it 4.5 stars, definately the best film I've seen this year.
3378;The prefect summer movie with great acting, great story telling, great characters, great plot, and amazing special effects.
3379;So get out and go see it!
3380;buster is an instant classic.
3381;I enjoyed this movie tremendously, and recommend this as a gift for yourself or someone else.
3382;man 2 (2004) is a bit scattered in places, but is still a more streamlined and focused effort, that solidly delivers action, drama, and excitement.
3383;Technical advances in special effects, and a tighter screenplay, contribute to the impressiveness of the film.
3384;alfred Molina is cast as Dr. Otto Octavius, and he nails the character almost perfectly.
3385;Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has moved on, and is involved with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of J. Jonah Jameson (J. k. Simmons).
3386;When an accident occurs during a test, Rosalie is killed, and a set of `smart' mechanical arms becomes fused to Octavius's body.
3387;Doc Ock and Spidey tangle for the first time, in a spectacular battle inside a bank, which continues up on the side of a building, with a very plucky Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in the middle of the fray.
3388;Peter's head gets so messed up, that he sees a psychiatrist, who screws him up even more.
3389;man, and returns to a `normal' life, looking like Harry Potter.
3390;the special effects are stunning, as Spidey returns to battle Doc Ock on a train.
3391;Doc Ock is relentless, and delivers an unconscious Spider.
3392;man 2 is the best of the three films produced so far.
3393;Kirsten Dunst shines, when put in a dangerous situation.
3394;man 2 nicely builds momentum, and moves forward strongly.
3395;The resolution may not be entirely satisfying, and but the overall ride is quite exciting and fun.
3396;This is probably the best superhero movie perhaps this side of 'Superman,' and if you don't like this kind of film, you must see it.
3397;You should see it simply because it skillfully presents the credible characters with deep emotions, and the film is not afraid of stopping a while to show how a superhero can be a real human, and a villain can too.
3398;the carefully written script (by Alvin Sargent, 'Julia') picks up the story of the original after two years.
3399;The story is always interesting, being unpredictable at times, with slight amount of humor and lots of first.
3400;In the middle of the speedy action scenes, director Sam Raimi shows his sense of humor, which is both surprising and hilarious.
3401;man 2' is probably better than the first one, in making more convincing characters and presenting well.
3402;Of course its great CGIs are not to be missed, but more amazing thins is that these CGIs really support the main feature of the film .
3403;the characters we truly care.
3404;And that can be rarely found.
3405;This is an entertaining and sometimes moving film, but it's not without its flaws.
3406;Those who are saying this is the best comic book film ever have likely not seen many comic book films.
3407;tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be an appealing couple.
3408;My personal favorite of the acting jobs is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who gives the film all of its funniest momemts.
3409;I honestly believe he should be up for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
3410;"man 2"" is almost spectacular."
3411;"man 2"" improves on the first one in almost every way."
3412;"man 2"" is a huge improvement over the first film, which I was slightly disappointed with."
3413;The acting is even better, the villain is perfect, and the climax is rousing.
3414;"man 2"" is the best comic book film out there, it's a good way to kill a couple hours, and to give yourself an adrenaline boost."
3415;Sam Raimi has by far exceeded himself with this breathtaking sequel, making it almost hard to believe that he was the wonder behind the entertaining yet stupefied ?
3416;Spiderman 2 makes all the other of today?s comic.
3417;The sequel certainly leans to a more humorous script than the original, but I am not afraid to say it works, it works, it works.
3418;So why on earth did I feel fantastically happy and warm inside when Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is walking to college in his geeky outfit to the same song I now find charmingly invigorating?
3419;delivery job with his college studies.
3420;, which in my opinion gives the character someone we can all share empathy.
3421;mr Maguire and Miss Dunst are both undeniably terrific in the film, Stan Lee and of course Steve Ditko (lets not get in a legal feud) could not have wished for better actors to play their beloved caricatures.
3422;In a very childish way I share the love for them so much as well.
3423;but I swear the special effects are much better this time!
3424;Spiderman does looks more realistic ?
3425;SPIDER MAN was one of the best comic book movies ever made and with almost all of the original cast returning, being helmed once again by the brilliant Sam Raimi, and having the enigmatic and paradoxical Dr. Ock as the main villain, SPIDER.
3426;mAN 2 was a movie I definitely wanted to see.
3427;Peter's best friend from high school, Harry Osborne is doing well and has taken control of OsCorp and turned it around into a competitive profit making business once again.
3428;As for Mary Jane, she's enjoying the fruits of her labors and is performing in a successful professional theatre.
3429;mAN 2 is better than most.
3430;It successfully continues the story from the original film without leaving audience members who haven't seen the first movie in the dark.
3431;The special effects blend seamlessly into the film.
3432;There's a great plot and the Doc Ock is perhaps even more complex and enigmatic than the Green Goblin.
3433;The acting is superb (especially considering this is a comic book action film) bringing more depth and life into the characters we met in the first movie.
3434;"And the direction, well what else is there to say except ""Sam Raimi is the man."""
3435;(I especially liked his homage to the Evil Dead movies).
3436;The first film stood completely on it's on.
3437;This was a drag and severely disappointing, especially in a movie that for the most part, was done so well.
3438;It glares like a smudge of coal on a wedding dress and is the one thing that keeps the movie from being the perfect sequel.
3439;This is one of the best movies Marvel ever made (next to The Punisher and X2: X. men United)!
3440;The effects, action, and storyline is even more interesting than the first.
3441;This is movie is VERY exciting to watch.
3442;To start off, remember that this is Howard Stern's favorite movie franchise.
3443;What really boggles my mind are the reviews that praise the actors in this.
3444;I promise I'll never review another.
3445;I believe this movie has everything that movie of such genre shoud have: action, great special effects, humor (a lot of it), great acting.
3446;He and Kirsten Dunst are great couple that are so natural together.
3447;And Alfred Molina is a perfect villain.
3448;While definitely improved, its really not that much more enjoyable than the first.
3449;The only difference is, I actually liked Peter Parker in this, though his whininess was constantly grating.
3450;I just finished watching this movie, and my god, so awesome, this movie makes sequel look awesome, this mayb the best sequel ever made and ever will be made, there alot of tension going on with Peter Parker, and the story is more better,and if you didnt see it yet I suggest you to get it becuase this is the best movie ever.
3451;man movies is great to watch.
3452;This box set is good.
3453;It brought back some warm memories.
3454;It continues the story of the first with more action and some romance.
3455;perfect for action movie fans.
3456;Emotional connection with the audience, that is what the characters in the movie Spider.
3457;man comic book series you would know that Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker is a perfect fit and powerful.
3458;Kristen Dunst is the real Mary Jane and somehow I feel she is even better than the character developed in the comic book series.
3459;when I see a movie I want to remember the characters and identify with them.
3460;That is the main ingredient in making a movie successful and destined for glory.
3461;I grew up with Spider Man and these films do more than give justice to the character.
3462;I love these movies and Spidey 2 is by far the best comic book superhero movie ever made.
3463;The second disc has a featurette on the new scenes and one on winning the Oscar for Best Visual Efects and some other docs on the amazing visual effects and theres also a behind the scenes look at Spidey 3 and some trailers.
3464;The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.
3465;"with a witty script written by Alvin Sargent (""What About Bob?"""
3466;"man"" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces."
3467;Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best (although sometimes the CGI Spider.
3468;man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider.
3469;"man 2"" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by ""Superman 2"")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp."
3470;"man 2"" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven."
3471;The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound.
3472;the 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition.
3473;There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.
3474;the second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre.
3475;It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary.
3476;"umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You"" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film ""Help!"")"
3477;is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider.
3478;man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film.
3479;"there's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),""Enter the Web"" uses multi."
3480;There's also the usual weblinks.
3481;Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.
3482;There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi.
3483;man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story.
3484;They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider.
3485;For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.
3486;The prequel was,is, really cool.
3487;So, as the story picks up, this movie will be cool.
3488;also, with the Punisher, another Marvel hero classic who also rocks, movie, there will be a hard competition.
3489;This film actually builds character development and gives the audience a Peter Parker that everyone will want to pull for.
3490;The incredible creation of Dr. Ock works as the special effects' greatest invention.
3491;His mechanical arms work with him in such a realistic way that many moviegoers will swear actor Alfred Molina really had those things fused to his spine and wired to his cerebellum.
3492;so much of the success of these films should be placed directly on the shoulders of its star, Tobey Maguire.
3493;Many questioned his original casting as the webslinger.
3494;While his past works have not exactly made him a surefire choice to play a superhero, his depiction of sensitive, lonely characters in his previous works (Pleasantville, Cider House) made him the perfect choice for Peter Parker.
3495;man 2 is able to revolutionize superhero films by allowing them to be about more than just special effects.
3496;"man"" franchise was certainly a noble beginning, this sequel somehow manages to improve upon it in a big way."
3497;"The first movie accomplished the task of getting Spider Man's origins out of the way and setting up the important characters, and ""Spider."
3498;man series has demonstrated a knack for crafting nemeses as vividly human as its hero, and as with the Green Goblin, we get to see the conflicts played out in Dr. Octopus's head as he decides to complete his fusion experiment no matter the cost.
3499;Perhaps more importatntly, Dr. Octupus's tentacles are a marvel of modern special effects, swinging wildly and with a mind of their own, smashing through concrete, effortlessly tossing whatever they can grab, and dispatching a room full of doctors in one harrowing early scene.
3500;this brings me to perhaps the most attractive aspect of this movie: it actually features believable, fleshed.
3501;"The ""X. men"" franchise has done an admirable job in this regard as well, but the ""Spider."
3502;"man"" movies still take the prize thanks to unusually intelligent dialogue and acting that communicates the movie's key themes while keeping the melodrama to a minimum."
3503;"Maguire's everyman appeal as Peter is undeniable
3504;While I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and character development and all that nice stuff, you can't have a superhero movie without some great action sequences, and this one has plenty of them.
3505;budget movies try to inject some comic relief into the proceedings, this one is notable in that it actually does it well.
3506;everything comes to a head in the movie's epic climax, with a concluding half.
3507;hour full of revelations, emotional drama, and of course lots of action.
3508;In fact, the bittersweet nature of this movie and its conclusion practically position it as the """"Empire Strikes Back"""" of the Spider."""
3509;If the next sequel is as smartly written and skillfully filmed as this one was, it can't come soon enough.
3510;Better known to the population as Spider.
3511;S. m 2 isn't just a continuation of the original, it's a whole new story, showcasing Peter Parker's personal problems, and how his Personal Life and Responsibility clash.
3512;man, yet in the end, Parker must risk his life for Mary Jane, and their love brings them together in the end.
3513;I found that the Special Effects were very well.
3514;done, with Doc Ock's metal arms, The Clocktower fight, The Train Sequence, and the Final Climatic Fight showcasing the Special Effects beautifully!
3515;notch, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and especially Sam Raimi's performance really standing out, and I expect them to be doing excellent things in the future.
3516;Mainly because I think the whole plotline of Peter Parker discovering his new powers and the responsibility that comes with it, and the resulting consequences to be a very intricate plot that edges out Spider Man 2 slightly.
3517;nonetheless, Spider Man 2, a tale of Love, Hate, Friendship, and Betrayal, stands as a Cinematic Milestone, An Action Plot with a Great Story and Acting, and in the end, a moral we can all live by, With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and we can never waver from out duty.
3518;man 2 is the perfect movie for the Summer, and the masses of people seeing it show why.
3519;The one thing I ask though is to make Venom, perhaps the greatest villian ever, an integral character in some of the next few movies.
3520;I wanted to see this movie so bad, I took a trip to Boston one weekend to see it at IMAX.
3521;He cried through the whole movie.
3522;And the whole keeping the secret from MJ just got old.
3523;Most of my friends loved it, I just thought it turned Peter Parker into a big cry baby.
3524;"I thought the first ""Spiderman"" movie was a very good movie."
3525;"But ""Spiderman 2"" is on another level."
3526;"Although the first ""Batman"" and maybe second ""Superman"" movies are comparable, I think ""Spiderman 2"" is the best superhero flick ever made."
3527;It has great action, special effects, and humor found from beginning to end.
3528;The element that separates it from the rest of the superhero pack, however, is the sensitive emotional depth displayed by Peter Parker, his grandmother, and Peter's girlfriend towards each other.
3529;"I haven't seen this showing of pure sweet emotions since ""Titanic,"" which will go down as one of the greatest movies of the 20th Century."
3530;i like it because it is good story telling, emotional and educational.
3531;The movie did had it's slow moments,but overall it was good.
3532;the special effects along with the stunts and music gets high marks.
3533;This movie does a very good job with a very tough task: presenting a comic, and presenting it with craftsmanship, maybe some respect, and the exaggerated sense proper to the genre.
3534;j. Jonah Jameson is great .
3535;volatile, fast talking, and never one to sacrifice a good news story to the facts.
3536;Doc Octopus is the comic book villain, with a blubbery look that just adds to his dis.
3537;He's also Spiderman, hero to all but one in the city.
3538;It's just a comic book, with all the good and bad that implies, and this movie captures it perfectly.
3539;man series is one that I feel is complete and with intergrity.
3540;occuring charecters are portrayed by the same actors and actresses in each movie keeping the entertainment value higher than predecessors of other super.
3541;I'm honestly bothered by this.
3542;Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more.
3543;mAN 2 is arguably the best comic book action movie ever made.
3544;"When I saw it in the theaters, I said: ""wow""!!"
3545;Luckily, I managed to see my friend's sampler.
3546;The extra 8 minutes of footage add context, lengthen and deepen some emotional scenes, inject the funniest moment of the film and (surprisingly) add and extend fight scenes.
3547;"He believes in (Stan Lee came up with this)""with great power comes great responsibility."""
3548;video: The picture is amazing, although the superbit version is still a bit better.
3549;Colors are radiant and vibrant.
3550;It was sharp and clean, and for some reason, the 2.1 transfer seemed brighter and yielded more detail in the black levels where needed.
3551;Sound is crisp and loud with 5.1 Dolby Digital track.
3552;hard fans, you still cannot get rid of the original version, it has the best special features.
3553;"hard fans will be happy to own it although I CANNOT give it a ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"" RATING."
3554;She was very anxious to watch this movie, especially since she love the first one and I thought the first one was good.
3555;gripe: Being born and raised in New York, why was there an elevated train in Manhattan?
3556;spider Man 1 was, in my opinion, the best superhero movie I had seen.
3557;The temptation to cast a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in the role was held at bay and some relatively unknown supporting members proved to be great in the from of Osbourne Jnr and Jameson.
3558;And boy did it deliver!
3559;what makes Spiderman 2 a great movie is, not just the action sequences, but the realistic and believable relationships between the characters, with the exception of Jameson who is a welcome dose of 'over the top'.
3560;The set pieces are breathtaking and Spidey gets more than as good as he gets from Doctor Octopus.
3561;man 2 is almost 10 years and although it is starting to show its age a little, it still holds up tremendously well.
3562;ray looks and sounds very good and this version also includes the extended cut as well, which I still haven't seen so I'll be checking that out sometime.
3563;On an emotional level, it has everything.
3564;On a character level, it has everything.
3565;On special effects, action, and story.
3566;Also, the elevated train sequence with Spider.
3567;man is an emotional highlight of film and just a great piece of filmmaking.
3568;This is by far, the best film adaption of a superhero comicbook character surpassing the first SPIDER.
3569;fold and director Sam Raimi put it all together because he has a love and respect for the character(s).
3570;go for the sequel due to some behind the scenes health problems (and other situations clouded in mystery), but thank the movie gods that he pulled himself together and made the film because he is so good as 'Peter Parker'.
3571;Alfred Molina is equally great as Doctor Octopus/Otto Octavius, and even this character was expanded to more than a one.
3572;This is a very satisfying film bringing to life one of most popular comicbook superheroes in the world and raising the bar for future film adaptions of comicbook heroes.
3573;i liked Tobey Maguire a lot more in this one than I did the first movie.
3574;He just seemed better for the role.
3575;He just looked, and acted the role so much better.
3576;I liked the hair colour more in this one.
3577;It looked realistic, like a red head should look.
3578;alfred Molina was a welcome addition to the cast.
3579;The character has a good 40 years of background and I feel that Molina played it to perfection.
3580;He stayed true to the character and gave it his own flare.
3581;and it was great to see Jameson with a bigger role this time.
3582;I think that J. k. Simmons is an amazing actor and got to play with his hilarious character more.
3583;Being someone who follows the comics, I found it to be true to the Spider.
3584;all in all, a terrific film.
3585;While that tact worked very well while first harnessing his abilities in the first film, in this movie it just gets old.
3586;finally, while the villain Doc Ock is visually pretty cool (what with all those tentacles flying around!)
3587;Nothing like the intriguing character development of The Joker by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight.
3588;"so, while the special effects of the film were excellent and the action scenes superb, I can't give it any better than an ""average"" rating due to all its contrived plots/relationships/characters."
3589;man 2 was a superb sequel.
3590;A nice recap during opening credits, excellent writing, acting, cinematography, directing, special.
3591;If you like suspense, romance, laughter, tears and excitement, this is your movie.
3592;Spiderman 2 4k looks great on my Sony 4k TV.
3593;Topped with a perfect cast and director, this movie successfully entertwines action, romance, drama, comedy, and suspense into one great movie that will be a classic for ages to come.
3594;This movie is extremely well.
3595;written and produced, and it has to be my favorite movie of all time.
3596;It will, however, have to go to extreme measures to beat this one!
