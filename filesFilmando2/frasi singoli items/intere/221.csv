id;spiegazione
1;As great as this movie actually is, it is difficult to find on streaming.
2;Armageddon is so entertaining, you'll wonder why it was not offered through subscription!
3;A Sensational movie, mixed with humour, action, and the delicacy of melancholy and love.
4;Willis is at his best here.
5;A must be viewed movie, for movie watchers at large.
6;It's such a shame, good actors, great theme song.
7;"I love this movie
8;This is one of my favourite films.
9;It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie.
10;The characters are great, and by the end of the film you get quite attached to them.
11;The soundtrack is really cool, as it adds atmosphere to the movie.
12;compared to films like Deep Impact this is 100X better!
13;I think people need to see this film as having great action sequences, good characters, a good soundtrack, all in all an excellent movie!Don't be so cynical!
14;This 1998 film shows the threat to the earth from an asteroid.
15;sized asteroid that will hit Earth in 18 days, and Extinction Level Event.
16;drilling platform in South Asia, with their personality conflicts.
17;the world knows of the peril.
18;The special NASA crew leaves on their mission.
19;A fuel leak causes a fire"
20;The special effects of this film is better than 'Star Wars'.
21;This is an entertaining film in spite of the many, many cliches.
22;its Armageddon everybody has scene it andit is a great movie it's got a great cast good special effects great movie.
23;I bought this movie off Amazon.
24;And it is many things.
25;It's a guy movie, with lots of cool explosions and electronic gadgets.
26;It's a science fiction movie (emphasis on the word FICTION) with errors so enormous, I'm sure actual scientists found it pants.
27;It's a terrific showcase for American stereotypes not just of themselves, but of the world around them.
28;If you love the movie Armageddon then you will really love this Criterion Edition.
29;The two commentaries are excellent and insightful, the story boards are fun to see, the Aerosmith video and interview are too cool, and all the trailers rock!
30;If you love the movie and want to know how it was made by the people who made it this is definitely for you.
31;The movie had a pretty good plotline.
32;An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clich s that it becomes an entertaining, full.
33;throttle action film that can be watched again and again.
34;With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique.
35;sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now .
36;Michael Bay has created a picture.
37;perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film.
38;Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason.
39;They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat.
40;She carried the weight of her father and soon.
41;be fianc well into the asteroid.
42;Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly.
43;His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen.
44;While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time.
45;While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it, Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it.
46;"Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this ""everyman"", the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture."
47;I am happy to see it in the collection.
48;"It is the birth of the superhero, it is the clich Americana that we face everyday
49;Bay, in this film, has captured the truth.
50;What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film.
51;He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no.
52;brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.
53;A new found respect for Mr. Bay's work has been discovered, and while """"Transformers"""" will never live up the hype, the early work of Bay remain pivotal instruments in American cinema."""
54;"watch again Bay's ""The Rock"" which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides."
55;This movie brings the best out of us.
56;"It has it all
57;Armageddon is a great movie.
58;ben Affleck is great, Bruce Willis is great, Billy Bob Thornton rocks, Liv Tyler is so.
59;Bruce Willis as in all of his other movies was top notch and awesome' while Ben Affleck wasn't at his best.
60;This is by far my absolute favorite movie"
61;it is probably one of my favorites.
62;I enjoy the characters and their dialogues.
63;Steve Buscemi has some great lines .
64;armageddon is an enjoyable action flick that brings a tear to my eye .
65;Fun plot, and is a tear jerker .
66;A couple of years ago the movie groove.
67;rama with shows like this one and Deep Impact.
68;fi fans, this movie really stunk!
69;by contrast Deep Impact which also came out in 1998 was, in my opinion, a far superior piece of sci.
70;there was better acting, better story line, and more real emotion involved.
71;to share ideas and thoughts.
72;I'll say it: I'm a Michael Bay fan.
73;First of all, the Criterion transfer is digitally remastered and is beautiful.
74;In a movie governed by special effects, it really makes a difference.
75;Also the sound is far superior to the Touchstone release.
76;there is an analysis of the special effects that's real cool, as well.
77;The special effects reel shows you how they composed a few of the action sequences.
78;finally, the Criterion edition is real hard to find.
79;It's a story of Love, dedication to a job, comedic relief of the bizarre and down to earth characters.
80;There's comedy, drama, romance, action, and a basic story.
81;line which is completed perfectly by the characters.
82;The actors really bring you into the movie.
83;The choice of actors is most perplexing .
84;The unbelievably unrealistic plot is surprisingly funny.
85;realistic, and of course based on a love story just to intice the younger generation of the audience.
86;the problem has been fixed it is armageddon and this is a really good movie.
87;great action flick is a little too much love story at times but great movie
88;a great movie one of my favorite disaster movies that i have seen.
89;This movie was a really good representation of what the world would be like if something like this really happened.
90;this movie is cheesy and ridiculous in all kinds of ways but it is so good.
91;Ben Affleck is in his last likeable role and Bruce Willis in his last big hit.
92;It was back in the day, back in the good ol' 90s.
93;Otherwise the basic plot is good and some nice outerspace special effects.
94;I think this movie was so good.
95;I cried so much at the end.
96;But you know what, this movie is fun.
97;This is a summer time popcorn flick.
98;Every performace was wonderful and of course any movie with Steve Buscemi riding a nuclear warhead can't be all bad.
99;Bottom line in this movie is fun.
100;"Armageddon / B00000G3PA*Spoilers*If I were rating ""Armageddon"" based on the first 45 minutes or so alone, I'd probably give it a solid four stars, maybe even five."
101;The triangle between father, daughter, and lover is an amusing one, and Tyler in particular shines as she balances a complex tightrope of emotions .
102;The high note continues as the obligatory Introduction/Recruiting scenes start rolling, and the film is canny enough to drape everything in over.
103;Even better, Billy Bob Thornton plays the straight man to all this and plays it well, highlighting the wacky fun and exposition.
104;forwarding through a good deal of the filler middle.
105;after all, it's cool and it was also probably intended as comic relief .
106;While not the best movie I've ever seen, it's definitley one of the most entertaining.
107;The audio commentary is fantastic, with tons of extra content to give the viewer a little more insight into the workings of the movie, as well as the movie business and production process.
108;The gag reel is hilarious, enough said.
109;Bruce Willis leads the crew, challenged for authority constantly by Ben Affleck, who is dating Bruce's daughter played by Liv Tyler.
110;the movie is of course full of edge.
111;The action is intense, and there are some scenes that stir the emotions.
112;Things get complex when it turns out the asteroid is solid metal and it breaks drill bits.
113;very strong acting and characters.
114;The concept is a bit old, but, this is a fresh version.
115;I do recommend this movie!
116;You know, there's the good Bruce (The Sixth Sense) and then there's.
117;A huge Meteor is heading for Earth, and we're all about to die.
118;His fellow workers (all with colorful backgrounds) will be able to go from beer drinking party animal roughnecks, to fully trained and specialised astronauts in about 6 weeks, and then try and pull off this amazing feat before we all get roasted.
119;Sounds great, and actually it is a lot of fun .
120;just make sure you leave the grey matter behind on this one and accept it for what it is.
121;What other movies have you seen, Cool as Ice?
122;I like all the characters but I like the big black guy a lot he is my favorite actor good
123;Definitely top 10 fave for me :.)
124;great action and story line.
125;Really heart wrenching and warming hero story.
126;What matters to me when watching a movie is that I enjoy it.
127;This must be one of the most exciting films I have ever seen.
128;The ending kinda touched me to (which surprised me).
129;It's amazing to have over 5 hours of features (over 7 1/2 hours with the movie).
130;Since it just came in yesterday I obviously have not seen everything yet, but I am very pleased with what I have seen so far.
131;Oh yeah, I think you will be surprised how many trailers there are!
132;Actually, see all the movies produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer!
133;Good job for everyone else in this cast of Armageddon!!
134;I love movies that take on the bad thing in space.
135;The cast of characters kept things very interesting.
136;Stormare's pushy Russian cosmonaut is great fun, as is Buscemi's space.
137;And by all means does it deserve a one.
138;i do believe that it is scenes like those that actually help you like the characters in this movie.
139;I must say that this is one of my top 5 favorite movies.
140;Sure there are a lot of haters and bashers of the film but like what other's have said, you should take it for what it is, an action film with special effects.
141;This movie has other deeper themes such as honor, sacrafice,love, and reconciliation and redemtion.
142;For what it's worth I belive the deeper themes to the movie make it more of appreciated and show the better side of humanity.
143;Personally, I'd recommend this film for these reasons more if anything.
144;And the original music score was beautiful!
145;A tremendous amount of money and talent in the service of a trash script.
146;If you want to see a movie with a similar theme done with intelligence and insight, with some real emotion and characters that approximate actual human beings, and excellent special effects that actually service the story, see Deep Impact.
147;Lucky to get one star but since I did get a decent laugh from it., and yes I did watch the whole thing (what was I thinking! )
148;This movie pretty much has everything.
149;Action, love and saving the Earth.
150;The extra material really make this movie a whole lot better.
151;Its totally uncensored stuff and its great.
152;Theres also a great technical commentary as well as excellent production making of featuretts.
153;definately not the greatest movie of all time but for the person who loves movie making this is the 1 for u.
154;The movie is amazing, the effects, the storyline and the ending.
155;Surround sound makes it even better.
156;has a good feeling about it.
157;One of those film I put on while I'm home doing something.
158;And it keep's me company.
159;daughter movies, and this one features the end of the world.
160;Bonus!Special effects are good, and the characters are funny.
161;Very fast delivery and a great price!
162;We enjoyed watching it again and again!
163;Highly recommend it to anyone!
164;this movie had awesome actors, great special effects, and in all seriousness, i didn't find it SO implausable that i couldn't bear to watch.
165;Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton and Steve Buschemi all turn in stellar performances.
166;This movie will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll just WOW you!!!!
167;This one is sure to be added to film history syllabi.
168;Riveting, complex characters and a tightly.
169;This is a older movie that I saw on cable a few months ago and watched it over 10xs, Its a awesome movie with a GREAT cast of actors, I would recommend this movie to both the young and old, it has it all, Humor, Serious, And Tear jerker,I give this a 10.
170;i also received this movie way before promised date and the price was also rite, trust me get this and watch it with your family, friends ect.
171;Now, I normally like big, fun action movies.
172;I thought I would like this one.
173;This is a very overbloated film with little to no fun at all.
174;Bruce Willis is fine and all, but Ben Affleck seems to just be there to look pretty.
175;The special effects are, of course, great and very impressive.
176;Why, it is one of the most greatest action films ever made, and it is brought to us by action director Michael Bay (He is my favorite movie director).
177;I have liked this movie even before I knew he directed it.
178;I rememeber seeing this in theaters when I was ten years old back in 1998, and it put me on the edge of my seat.
179;It had such great special effects, alot of intense action scenes, some great comedical moments, and even some very emotionl parts at the end of the of the film.
180;Yes, I know it was a very long movie, but the movie will make such an impact on you that you'll never notice.
181;DEEP IMPACT was more of an emotional movie while ARMAGEDDON is more of an action thrill ride.
182;The difference, is that this one is enormous, it the size of Texas.
183;In order to do that, NASA must get the Worlds best deep core driller.
184;All the time in the world is all they've got.
185;in my opinin, I think this is the best movie directed by Michael Bay.
186;Its has all sorts of great elements.
187;I know it sounds dumb, but it does make a great pop corn flick.
188;dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) sends for the best drillers and demolition well cappers in the world to use nuclear bombs on it.
189;Reviewers who don't enjoy Action and Adventure movies should not write articles about them but stick to the type they enjoy!
190;The world is about to be destroyed, and all the astronauts (or 'supposed' astronauts) can to is bicker, squabble, and add uselessly witty comments here and there.
191;i especially liked the performances from 'bear' who bought a touch of realism to the whole thing, and 'col. willie Sharp' as the focussed, cold pilot of the mission.
192;Armageddon stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and many other likeable and capable actors.
193;It's not that I don't like films that have no ambition except being great fun, because I believe that this is a very high ambition.
194;He should study the action scenes of films like The Terminator or Face/Off frame by frame.
195;Heading the support team in Houston is Billy Bob Thornton, who gives the best overall performance in the film, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely in the role!Don't THINK while watching this, or you'll get in trouble (I loved how NASA has size 50XXXL spacesuits on hand for a couple of the beefier drillers!)
196;"
197;this is the Wild West in Space, with enough rootin'.
198;this movie is lots of fun on many levels.
199;This allows us to have fun without having to listen to a bunch of campy over.
200;The daughter played by Liv Tyler (before her The Lord of the Rings fame) adds a great catalyst to the story.
201;The rest of the team is rounded off by contemporary actors of which you will recognize immediately.
202;the graphics and action both explosive and human will hold you to the end.
203;this movie is worth watching over again so you can see the nuances that were missed the first time through.
204;Buscemi and Billy Bob are brilliant, the effects are crispy (talk about jagged edge .
205;and Bear's singing is outstanding.
206;This is a great film for those with the attention span of about 15 seconds.
207;I had high hopes for this film.
208;talent"""" Affleck and Bruce Willis attempt to save the day."""
209;Armageddon is a hilarious and completely epic movie if you look at it in the right light.
210;The visuals and soundtrack are very well crafted.
211;Turn off your brain and just enjoy it .
212;or turn on your brain and enjoy the excellent cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound effects, sound editing, etc.
213;"I can imagine it
214;On second thought please dont.
215;reaping the rewards of a largely pliant movie going public.
216;but it is entertaining,fun,and filled with exciting space action,a prime summetime blockbuster.
217;enjoy what you want to enjoy,make up your own mind.
218;I've made up my mind that I love Armageddon,despite its flaws.
219;This movie is one of my favorites.
220;Although it's not a thriller, I still thoroughly enjoyed it.
221;This movie is a lot like the movie Deep Impact, only WAY better.
222;Armageddon has lots of explosions and is filled with action.
223;There's also some emotional scenes that might make some cry.
224;In addition, it has great music to it, and at the end there's a music video from Aerosmith.
225;I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing is a great song!
226;Armageddon is a great movie!
227;Anything in this movie resembling reality is purely coincidental.
228;This is a highly watchable Type B"
229;Forget the totally incredible scenes in outer space.
230;Great stuff for boys of all ages.
231;Here's a movie with suspense, drama, ACTION, and humor!
232;Thank you so much for the quick mailing of this movie.
233;Of course if you have ever seen the movie you know its an amazing thrill ride worth every penny.
234;This movie with its special effects, story line and the adventure is without a question, the best that I have ever seen.
235;Also the best ever made by Bruce Willis.
236;Bruce Willis has finally played a more believable character.
237;Terrific special effects cannot possibly hope to buoy this dung heap of a movie.
238;denominator film that the teeming masses of American consumers could get behind in their quest to cease critical thought all together.
239;I have never liked any of his movies.
240;I enjoyed Deep Impact because it was more about how we as humans, prepare for the end.
241;i am very pleased with the order I placed.
242;bruce Willis gives a fine performance, he's been in so many stinkers he makes it look easy.
243;They do have funny moments occasionally.
244;It has some of the best actions scenes in any movie of it's type.
245;I feel this kind of fimmaking is ahead of its time, but I have doubts about its potential.
246;Thumbs up to Billy Bob Thorton for playing a new.
247;The Criterion Edition to Armageddon is a spectacular compilation of everythng you'll ever need to see about Armageddon.
248;Armageddon is a very good movie.
249;it was very dramatic and action packed.
250;I liked Bruce Willis in this role.
251;The other actors were also very good.
252;I say to all viewers, of this caption, that it was also very emotional at the end.
253;A must see for almost everyone!
254;Armaggeddon is one of my new favorite CLASSIC movies!
255;I'll tell you what he's talking about .
256;"great sci fi action, Baby!There's been a lot of ""uh oh, the world is about to end"" movies in the past decade, but this is the best one."
257;Bruce Willis is great in the lead role and the rest of the cast are all great, too.
258;the story and great action scenes had me on the edge of my seat.
259;Also, even though I usually don't like love stories thrown into action movies, I enjoyed the one in this between Liv Tyler and Ben Stiller.
260;all in all, this is a totally great movie.
261;Price was right for this movie.
262;It's one of those movies that if you're going into it looking for scientific inconsistencies then you could genuinely write a novel on them, but if you're going into the movie looking to be entertained for over 2 hours then it will certainly deliver what you want.
263;Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, the list goes on and on for really big name actors that helped generate the high box office takings and give us one hell of a reason to come out of the movie theatres smiling from ear to ear.
264;The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler who played his daughter in the film was something to enjoy in itself but the alternate chemistry between Affleck and Willis was also something to really enjoy as Willis would constantly insult and chase Affleck away from his daughter.
265;the side characters including Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan and Owen Wilson really give us the comic relief of this movie and along with come of the more saddening scenes they have the ability to lift us up with their antics.
266;the CGI and other huge settings are great and make it at times over the top and yet they come across as realistic and cool.
267;This is a genuinely fun movie but is something that in order for you to enjoy it you need to leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the swearing and destruction.
268;I think this film accomplishes both.
269;From the beginning Willis' character is identifiable and worth watching.
270;Affleck adds in his own charm and who doesn't love Billy Bob?The action from this film is excellent, filled with explosions, suspense filled dialogue, and even some gun shooting fun.
271;There is plenty of comedy to keep it light, and enough of that sappy stuff that my wife cried.
272;It's a fun move, well worth watching and well worth owning.
273;Armageddon is my favorite movie.
274;It was funny and romantic at the same time.
275;even in gone in 60 seconds he could put one somewhere in Cage's office)But as the producer Bruckheimer repeatedly says,he makes movies to entertain people and Armageddon does it perfectly.
276;michael Bay is the perfect director for this kind of movies,he really delivers (in The Rock as well)The extras,are not bad but I would say there could be more deleted scenes.
277;the music video and stroy boards are very good.
278;Sure, the science might be bad, but it's probably just a lot of rollicking good fun.
279;filled with a fun cast and special effects that are still fresh `til this date, Armageddon might be the movie you need to watch whenever you want to see a movie that contains any of the following items from my first sentence.
280;The writers of the movie are the ones to blame for the illogical sequences mention (and those are just a few) but I found the directing by Michael Bay quite impressive.
281;Bruce Willis at his best again, even when conquering the end of time as we know it!
282;Good job to the crew of Armageddon!
283;It had an interesting cast.
284;I love this movie and I love the price I got it for!
285;This movie is absolutely my FAVORITE!!!
286;It may seem like it's for space nerds but I hate that kind of stuff and still love this movie.
287;It has the best characters, its dramatic but also soooo very funny.
288;Has Bruce Willis, Ben affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thorton, Owen Wilson and many other excellent characters.
289;The soundtrack is great too, done mostly by Arrow Smith
290;Loved the movie, my first time seeing it.
291;Armageddeon is a must see movie!
292;The cast and crew did a terrific job.
293;This movie has alot of glued to your seat serious moments, but as well, this movie has some falling out of your seat with laughter moments as well.
294;I loved every bit of it.
295;If you want this deluxe version, you love the movie.
296;So, you want to know, is the extra expense worth it?
297;I've just got five words for you: Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!
298;This two disk edition provides hours of behind the camera information and insight.
299;The first commentary track is with the director, producer and stars of the movie.
300;The director, Michael Bay, passes on interesting information on the making and origins of the film.
301;Bruce Willis seems to be very low key and Ben Affleck is a riot.
302;All in all, a very interesting track.
303;The second track is with the director of photography and various science consultants.
304;I found this track very enjoyable.
305;The information provided by the DP is technically oriented and provides great insight into the art of cinematography.
306;The scientific commentaty is also very interesting.
307;Disk number two is packed with goodies.
308;There is a blooper reel that is so so.
309;The transfer for the set is razor sharp and the sound is spectacular.
310;Armageddon is the best new release that I've seen in ages.
311;It's definately the most well done action movie that I've seen a long time.
312;When I saw it I ran the full gambit of emotions.
313;The movie had me laughing, somber, and crying.
314;Bruce Willis was suberb, simply the best action performance that he's had since the Die Hard movies.
315;I have seen this film five times, and cried for four of them.
316;All I can recommend is that you watch it, and make up your own mind.
317;I will not go into the film, and the plot as this has already been well documented, all I can say is that I hope you enjoy it.
318;It was one of the first movies I watched with my son.
319;I could watch this every day for a year!
320;The Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat.
321;It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.
322;Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things.
323;Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny.
324;The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects people.
325;the commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.
326;although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.
327;the Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical behind.
328;picked, it's still very exciting and enjoyable.
329;(P. s. thes soundtrack is great to.)
330;Because I liked it more than the other reviewers did, I am giving it four stars.
331;I liked the interaction between the characters, and I enjoyed Bruce Willis' performance, as well as Ben Affleck.
332;overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would see it again.
333;Armegeddon is a fast food movie that delivers the goods to the core audience it was intended for.
334;If you want something with a little of action, romance and emotion and are able to take it with a grain of salt, this is the perfect flick.
335;Shipped quick and the price was awesome.
336;The movie is a great flick.
337;Bruce Willis is one great actor.
338;Love the characters in this film.
339;"Ms. G. Avery ""georgia"" (Directly below) is utterly right."
340;this film packs everything that makes films great.
341;however the rockets are new and experimental in the film plus.
342;anyway the film is great, the music is brill, special effects top notch, acting perfect, filmed amazingly.
343;This is a very good film!!
344;the SFX in the film are good, not great.
345;Armageddon came out at the same time asDeep Impact (Special Collector's Edition), a far superior film covering much the same subject matter.
346;tag Drillers (Bruce Willis, Oscar.
347;winner:Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Micheal Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson and Ken Hudson Campbell), are ask to go in Space with NASA Astrounauts to Stop the Meteor from Coming to Earth.
348;directed by Micheal Bay (Bad Boys 1 and 2, The Rock, Pearl Harbor) made a very entertaining film, which it never does take, itself seriously, which is a good thing.
349;This film has terrific cast including, Oscar.
350;anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and An impressive Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.
351;Great Visual Effects by Dream Quest Images and Industrial Light and Magic (ILM).
352;This film is Corny beyond Words but this is a exciting Sci.
353;Incredible detail, colors fully saturated, and amazing contrast.
354;"take back 1/2 a star for some initial level surfing in the center channel
355;sized asteroid could easily fit inside.
356;As it was, I found the movie to be as entertaining as one of Bill Clinton's old speeches.
357;just so i can laugh and cry.
358;And I say that as far as the movie goes.
359;But don't worry, the wait is worth it.
360;actually the farms often showed in the media is a rarity .
361;I still brings tears to my eyes, and makes we wish we had more heroes like these guys.
362;please make more movies that make people feel good, where the good guys win, even if they have to pay a terrible cost.
363;Reluctant heroes are all the more inspiring.
364;I will admit that the movie does have some suspense and the special effects are fantastic.
365;The material is very good and interesting (with a couple of exceptions), but once you've seen it, it's enough.
366;The segments on visual effects, storyboards, and production design are excellent and definitely up to usual first.
367;But if you think long enough, you'll easily come up with dozens of movies that are much worthier of your time and money.
368;Just got this in today.
369;fi action movie with a great story.
370;It's just the way his movies are and it's why me and my friends love them.
371;A meteor shower devastates New York City in a spectacular fashion.
372;There are plenty of colorful characters on the team and the level of comic relief is strong enough to give this movie a warm atmosphere.
373;Particularly funny is Peter Stormare's performance as a half.
374;In addition to the main plot of going into space and blowing up the rock, there's also a love story between Harry's daughter Grace and Ben Affleck's character that Harry doesn't approve of.
375;bomb' moments throughout the film, which make good thrills considering that the world is at stake.
376;Armageddon has a lot of special effects which is a good thing for a space movie.
377;The Space Shuttles' flight through the meteor field is incredible.
378;The scenery on the asteroid is very beautiful and the jagged cliffs and canyons create a stunning otherworldly environment.
379;i strongly recommend this movie.
380;But the simple point is this to me, it is entertaining and it hits on so many personal levels that it is impossible not to get caught up in the moment.
381;The fact is, that is the exact reason why I love this movie so much.
382;I WANT to be moved.
383;I WANT to feel what I feel throughout this movie.
384;I think the characters are great, the plot is great, and the experience is unmatched.
385;It offers an emotional rollercoaster like no other and, even though it is very dramatic, that's the experience that I want.
386;If you allow yourself to simply be a viewer and enjoy it, you will find that it is entertainment at a level that is hard to find anymore.
387;It should of won best picture!
388;It has over 5 hours of special features, including the director's cut of the film, deleted scenes, special effect analysis, interviews, theatrical trailers, a making of featurette, and audio commentary from the Director Michael Bay, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, stars Bruce Willis Ben Affleck, cinematographer John Scwartzman, NASA consultant Dr. Joe Allen and asteroid consultant Ivan Bekey.
389;I don't know why I'm even writing a review on this movie right now, but this is one of the dumbest movies ever made.
390;I label Michael Bay films as a guilty pleasure .
391;pleasing endings and plot holes big enough to hold an asteriod the size of Texas .
392;The movie also comes with a hilarious gag reel and equally.
393;Well, the actor one is good but there is one with a bunch of real.
394;if you enjoyed Armageddon as much as I did then you'll probably want to own this double.
395;It moves me every time I watch it, Just Plain Awesome!
396;This movie starts off with some great effects and some good scenes featuring the drilling crew.
397;But for a good price it is worth getting.
398;Take this move for what it is which is an exciting action flick.
399;May be the bone headed movie critics believe that people would be relaxed enough to take a tea break.
400;Unlike DEEP Impact which resembles a 2 hours self pitty borefest, Armegedon got it right by expressing the true nature of humanity which is self preservation by all means necessary by never excepting defeat.
401;I enjoyed the plot sequences ,the suspense, and action pact drama, and even the comedic twists that comes along the way.
402;Jerry Bruckheimer did a great job of countinously keeping a viewers attention with the events that lead up to the destruction of the asteroid.
403;He was breif and to the point with the scenes.
404;As I said, this movie is what it is which is a high impact action flick and it does a great job for being that.
405;The movie was priced great and played in new condition!
406;The movie is a Must See and Own .
407;Tyler's big final scene (Oh DADDY!
408;Instead of inducing tears I found myself laughing hysterically.
409;get rid of her and you might have something worth owning here.
410;very good movie , good conditions of the disk, plays perfectly on blu.
411;I thought this movie was alright, but right after deep impact came out bam this comes out.
412;But all in all i guees this movie was enjoyable.
413;What comes next is pure joy!
414;a very well written story with maybe a ridiculous but yet, fun premise: Country rednecks in outer space, Bruckheimer style.
415;By the way, the score composed by Trevor Rabin is outstanding!
416;I loved this movie I jumped, I laughed, and almost cried.
417;So excited to have it in our collection now!
418;This is one of his favorite movies.
419;It was a great gift idea.
420;The special effects, the story line, the soundtrack and the actors (Willis, Thornton, Steve B.) make this movie a must see for everybody.
421;It is so well written and full of action.
422;I recommend this movie to anybody that's into sci.
423;Nothing is good about this movie.
424;Anyone who likes this movie is an idiot.
425;Great no brainer popcorn film with great special effects.
426;I always loved this movie it is all around a lot of fun.
427;This movie is worth watching a hundred times or more.
428;a good suspense action thriller and at times comical and maybe unbelievable, but it will keep your attention right to the end.
429;The story is well conceived and written, and the ending pays off, if a bit perfunctorily once back on earth.
430;All in all, a satisfying evening's entertainment.
431;While it has some cheesy moments and the acting, the character building was wonderful.
432;Very emotional form sensual to hilarious to tearful and heart ache.
433;* A single nuclear weapon is capable of splitting a piece of rock 500 miles in diameter.
434;anybody who complained about inaccurate science in Deep Impact should best stay away.
435;That's because it's a lot more fun to see meteors crash into buildings than it is to see Elijah Wood trying to emote.
436;It celebrates manliness and the love of macho activities like getting into drunken brawls at strip clubs.
437;You will see more acts of testosterone driven sexual insecurity than if you dropped my high school football team into the middle of a gay pride parade.
438;the Rewind and Forward controls on this are very sensitive and will take you back or forward further than you may want.
439;We both enjoyed this movie for it's entertainment value.
440;(For an asteroid with no atmosphere, that was one seriously strong wind!)
441;The relationships were developed in a reasonable fashion, and the scenes of prayer from various countries, cultures, and religions around the world was a nice touch.
442;I thoroughly enjoyed watching the characters in this movie interact with one another.
443;This movie is just another example of Hollywood making movies that are big on special effects and scarce on plot.
444;i keep feeling like i want to enjoy this movie, like i have to enjoy it.
445;but the story isnt all that good.
446;Armageddon is a great action flick from modern day master of action Michael Bay(Bad Boys, The Rock).
447;The story may be unrealistic, but who cares it an enjoyable movie with Bruce Willis and Co.
448;This is one of those movies so bad it's great!
449;I think, this movie makes it clear it's out for fun and to pull the heartstrings.
450;It's funny, it's silly, it's corny, it defies all logic at times, but it's damn fun entertainment.
451;I laughed, sniggered, and like a sap, cried at this fluff.
452;buscemi is worth the ticket alone!!
453;Thank you so much for providing this to us.
454;The story of a huge asteroid about to collide with Earth and a group of oil drillers to prevent that from happening + Bruce Willis, what more can you ask for right?Well, all I can say is that if you do have one choice for this movie, the Criterion Collection is the way to go.Yes, both movies have outstanding video and the digital 5.1 is used a lot in this movie.
455;also, the movie contains trailers.
456;This version of Armageddon is highly recommended!
457;Although this movie would never qualify for an Oscar, I still love it.
458;I love the interplay between the characters and its when I first fell in love with Liv Tyler.
459;a worthy film for masochists.
460;strewn special effects, rapid cuts, and a tremendous number of cliches as a substitute for an actual story, plot, believable characters, and some sort of dramatic tension.
461;As a result, this ranks with Jaws 3.
462;Armageddon is a great movie!
463;It has awesome special effects, and a cool story.
464;For the most part it is believable.
465;The first half of the film deals with the team training on the ground, and this half is very funny!
466;After the space launch, the film takes on more action and suspense, but retains it's humor.
467;ben Afleck, fresh from the set of Good Will Hunting, gives a great performance as the man who is in love with Liv Tyler's character, Willis's daughter.
468;My favorite actor in this though is Steve Buschemi, who is hilarious as one of the oil drillers.
469;He has some of the best lines in this movie.
470;The replay value is very high, because the film moves beyond the action, and delves into the hearts and souls of it's main characters, making you root for them even more.
471;Saw it in the theater ONCE and that's all I'll be watching it.
472;One of the biggest box office smash hits of 1998, """"Armageddon"""" was a well."""
473;deserved box office hit and sometimes one of the most unfairly criticized movies of recent years.
474;It's actually quite funny to watch even though I would lean more towards the Greenpeace people and also Harry laughing at and ridiculing them.
475;His funny personality adds quite a bit to this movie.
476;Armageddon is an extremely adrenaline.
477;pumping action flick with a highly intense visual assault (in a good way), and a good amount of comic humor occasionally in parts of the movie.
478;This is just my opinion but man this movie was a brutal, thrilling ride when seeing it on the big screen and when it came to the small screen, the punch was greatly reduced but still, it's an awesome popcorn movie.
479;Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
480;Doomsday has never sounded like so much fun.
481;It knows it's corny, it knows it's crazily larger than life, it knows it's out to push all those staple movie buttons, and so it does it all with a terrific sense of humour and, more importantly, on a scale that simply beggars belief but which .
482;Contrary to what some people say, director Michael Bay does a simply tremendous job of making the whole, massive juggernaut of a movie bolt along at a terrific pace, and even more remarkably, manages to engage your emotions even while you're laughing your head off at all the hokum.
483;Basically this film is pure cinema.
484;And if, as anyone with half a brain cell should see, you judge it in terms of what it does want to be, you will see that it succeeds quite magnificently.
485;The one good thing about Armageddon is not in the story, not in the special effects, but in the emotion it is able to instill through the performances of its actors.
486;the movie begins with a pretty nice retelling of the origins of Earth, as well as the extinction of the dinosaurs.
487;that last sentence pretty much describes the movie, which gives us a story they think we want to see, when in fact, there is so much more I wanted to see.
488;The movie also has so many situations in which things are about to go wrong, but right at the last minute, our heroes save the day.
489;one redeeming feature of this film is the emotion that it contains, and believe it or not, there actually is some.
490;The drillers are shown as having lives outside of their work: one has a small boy who lives with his mother, while the plot also goes into a bit of romance between Grace and AJ, one of the drillers.
491;This gives the movie a chance to exercise more of its father.
492;The group's journey into space also is aided by the performances, playing out all the situations nicely and with ease, giving the story a feel.
493;good attitude while adding some tension.
494;the cast is comprised of many well.
495;knowns, all of whom shine in their unique roles.
496;Bruce Willis is the ideal choice for Harry Stamper, being able to balance his rough and tough macho.
497;isms with an equal amount of emotion and feeling.
498;Liv Tyler plays Grace, his daughter, and their onscreen time together is believable and affectingly acted.
499;I enjoyed watching these two at work the most, for they are able to make us feel for them as they experience their perils.
500;worthy, he still does a good job of interacting with the story and the other actors' roles.
501;I did, however, feel that the movie has a solid emotional aspect that was brought into play by the performances of the actors.
502;I have always loved this movie both for the acting and for the special effects.
503;I highly recommend it for anyone who loves space adventures.
504;ray and I intend to be one of the first in line to get it!
505;This is quite a clever movie .
506;The leads are played well by Willis Liv Tyler, and the ever reliable Steve Buscemi and Ben Affleck provide great support as a technician and Tyler's love interest respectively.
507;Billy Bob Thornton is also worth mentioning as he adds a touch of class to the star.
508;the large scale effects on the oil rigs are handled exceptionally well, possibly better than the space scenes, although these too are better than average.
509;The story is OK, but a bit sinilar to Deep Impact and the real point of the story is the interpersonal relationships.
510;up, grit your teeth and enjoy the ride roller coaster.
511;This movie delivers nonstop action like a law firm cranking out past.
512;all viewers please check quantum physics at the door.
513;bruce Willis, a cantankerous leader of a bunch of renegade roughnecks (roughnecks who must fly to the asteroid and drill through 800 feet of solid metal and drop a nuke in the hole, mind you), is solid.
514;Billy Bob Thornton. . .yeah, okay.
515;The rest of the cast works well together.
516;they look like they had fun making this movie.
517;Which is only fitting: I dang sure had fun watching it.
518;Bruce Willis puts on a spectacular performance in Armageddon.
519;This is truly a classic film.
520;For those who have watched it a long time ago, and for those who haven't.
521;It is definitely worth purchasing the blu ray.
522;This is a great movie.
523;There is excessive picture flutter, like a flash of light noticable on the black bars.
524;"And given the centrality of film to our culture and the ways in which filmgoers personalize, love, hate, and discuss film, we can't be so complacent to say it's ""only a movie."
525;Jerry Bruckheimer has his name on many an expensive and high.
526;grossing film but has yet to make a single noteworthy and intellectually important cultural contribution.
527;fisted, cued with visuals and music that tell you what to feel and when (Hollywood films in general are adept at doing this).
528;And, gee, thanks Mr. Bay for the close.
529;What a cast they brought together to make this saga.
530;Very top notch adventure and tragedy.
531;I watched this movie in the theater 10 years ago, and I remember it as clear as day.
532;It was nonstop motivational speeches and a crescendo of dramatic save.
533;Seriously, it will give you that boost of confidence in your abilities you've been looking for.
534;Pearl Harbor, his following film, does away, for the most part, with this style of filming.
535;Drillers, Fathers and potential son.
536;This film does it pretty well, certainly, well enough to give the average viewer an entertaining 2 1/2 hours.
537;ups, visual fireworks, interpersonal fireworks, ensue.
538;Some people think the movie is terrific and some think it is far from terrific.
539;Well, this film certainly had the talent to amount to something!
540;Billy Bob Thornton playing NASA executive director Dan Truman turns in a believably impressive performance and leaves me wanting to see him in more scenes.
541;top love subplot which begins the movie with Willis [Harry S. Stamper] literally taking shots at his daughter's [Liv Tyler] bed mate [Ben Affleck] establishes the tone for this flick.
542;Very little of what followed was believable even in a fictionalized, fantasy sort of way.
543;the premise of this film and the talent on hand made this a potential powerhouse epic.
544;star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and Liv Tyler.
545;so, what we end up with is a movie full of slapstick comedy, combined with good special effects.
546;don't get me wrong: I'm all for fun movies.
547;"Con Air and ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" are two of my favorite movies as far as pure entertainment goes."
548;"Deep Impact is a far superior movie
549;If you ever want to know whats wrong with big budget movies, this is a perfect example.
550;This looked and sounded amazing and will continue to be one of my favorites to watch.
551;Love this movie, watch it so much, I know the lines by heart.
552;The Sticky actually liked the premise of this story.
553;Bruce Willis is the best.
554;This is his best performance since Die Hard.
555;steve Buscemi is hilarious in this.
556;And the special effects are great.
557;However, I'm not giving one star to the movie itself, some people love this stuff and its beside me to criticize them, but really I have to give it to the Criterion Collection.
558;this movie is both frustrating and fun.
559;The salvation of the world rests in the hands of a bunch of over.
560;They're not fully developed characters"
561;The world is on the brink of annihilation but thanks to Bruce Willis, calamity is narrowly averted at the very last minute!
562;It gives new meaning to the phrase 'over the top'.
563;Somebody please make Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer stop .
564;thank you for putting it on Blu ray
565;holds you in your seat .
566;Great movie to see during hard times in life.
567;Several things: great story, excellent actors, great acting, amazing visuals, top.
568;dark areas, the use of smoke and white, blue and green lighting to create atmosphere is perfect.
569;Everything in this movie is about visual detail, color and sound.
570;When you watch a movie like this, it's a delight to the eyes.
571;by the way, this movie also looks great on the Kindle Fire.
572;Armageddon is a brilliant film,(what ever anyone else thinks!)
573;with a proper interesting plot!
574;There are pretty well developed characters in it and the story is moving though it doesn't have any amazingly brilliant affects, it is definitely a film to watch!
575;I love it all thee same though.
576;Vivid, well acted movie full of many exciting moments.
577;And the comic and romantic moments are well handled.
578;Genuinely touching and heroic at the end.
579;the science aspects are at best so, so but you're carried away so much by the story you can ignore them.
580;The camera work is consistantly swooping with quick cuts.
581;"I saw ""Deep Impact,"" and even though the basic concept is just about the same I found that movie immeasurably more entertaining."
582;"And ""Deep Impact"" was NOT that good."
583;Ben Affleck is overrated because he's good looking.
584;I love this film and am glad I found this out of print release for so chea.
585;I think that this is one of the best films that Michael Bay ever made.
586;It has a great cast that gives great performances.
587;The effects in this film are also very impressive and amazing.
588;The action and suspense is fast.
589;paced and kept me entertained throughout the film.
590;I think that this is a really great film.
591;It's a little sappy at times, but it's a far superior movie.
592;Criterion releases are always worth the additional cost.
593;a classic Michael Bay and Bruckheimer movie.
594;Feel good crowd pleaser for everyone.
595;It's because both deal with meteors, space travel, and the possibility of human extinction.
596;Critics seem to favor Deep Impact more, while audiences appear to prefer Armageddon.
597;Deep Impact is more of a human drama, while Armageddon is more of a Hollywood.
598;They have their flaws, but they also have some very good material in either the plot or the action.
599;Let's first take a look at Armageddon.
600;The special effects do look great, particularly the NY meteor shower and the asteroid rockstorm.
601;It has some spectacular moments of action and suspense, most of the characters (especially Buscemi's) are likable, the special effects look amazing, and the music is really nice to listen to.
602;In the end, this film is adequate at best.
603;It has its flaws, but it's still watchable.
604;Not all that realistic, but I enjoyed it.
605;I don't want to give away any more details than I have to, but there's quite a bit of comedy in this movie, a lot of action, and drama as well, so there's a little bit of everything.
606;the best thing about this movie is it's fast paced and therefore the pain of various scenes is short.
607;also, there's some good one.
608;this is a great movie with great actors with sensitive sides, smart ass, will to choose and the choices we make as people can impact many.
609;Bruce Wills just gets better with age, have always loved his movies, always lots of action, you can't go wrong with this movie.
610;I have always loved this movie, great acting, wonderful edge of your seat story.
611;But am excited to, for the enhanced visual effects.
612;Liv Tyler is funny in this movie, unfortunately she didn't intend to be.
613;It's a popcorn movie, but the world in not any better for this film having been made.
614;now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress.
615;if this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it .
616;I've seen this movie only once, but I thought that it had a great storyline, an unexpected ending, and good ideas all the way throughout.
617;I laughed so much because of the truly funny lines and and cried because of the nobility of the characters!
618;The special effects folks did their job well.
619;The story is kinda sappy, but if you love outstanding special effects, this a great movie.
620;"The soundtrack, headlined of course by Aerosmith's ""I Don't Want to Miss A Thing"" is great ."
621;fi film I've ever seen!
622;I was pregnant this summer, so I saw A LOT of movies!!!
623;This movie is very satisfying when you don't want to think.
624;It was in your face action and laughs the whole time.
625;A definite must see for people who enjoy those types of movies!
626;There then now, I liked this movie because, simply, it's a good disaster flick with impressive actors.
627;Unlike in Deep Impact in which the astronauts are just nameless faces we see twice.
628;Just don't let the bad reviews scare you away from this excellent movie.
629;For those of us into action movies this is a must for your collection.
630;Not only does it bring together excellent actors,but also the reality that this one day could happen .
631;well you must have been asleep.
632;It has humour some wonderful moments where you constantly wondering what will happen next.
633;how often do you see that.yes.
634;Bruce Willis is at his best in this movie.
635;There's even a bonus feature at the end of this movie.
636;So watch it all the way through.
637;sizedmeteors shower Manhatten with a force that overturns cars and createscraters several feet deep.
638;the pic is absolutely awesome when watched on a full fledged surround sound home teatre system.
639;as for the movie itself, well Bruce boy was his usual macho man and all in all it was a entertaining hour and a half.
640;love this movie, the ending is sad, but great movie and I could watch this movie over and over and I would recommend this movie to anyone.
641;I'm one of those who really liked it.
642;My very favorite movie is Saving Private Ryan.
643;I actually enjoyed this movie.
644;I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing.
645;The score composed by Trevor Rabin was very moving and effective.
646;It is entertainment on the lighter side but the characters and special effects are enough to keep the viewer entertained when you just want to sit back and see the good guys save the world.
647;I enjoyed this movies, several times now.
648;This was an absolutely great special effects masterpiece.
649;The sound is brilliant and the images are crisp and clear.
650;What I also liked was that it kept me emotionally hooked in through most af the show.
651;fi, Bruce Willis and the lot, it's a must have.
652;Is the American viewing public really that simple.
653;This is always a fun movie for me to watch.
654;Now it's even better with my Blu.
655;So glad I got this.
656;It took a while to finally get the price down but it was worth the wait.
657;It sounds good to me anyway and will probably sound much better with the proper system.
658;Still glad I bought the Blu.
659;This is a great movie gift.
660;It arrived in excellent condition.
661;I still remember going to the theater to see it!
662;The cast is awesome and it's a fun movie!!!
663;This film is so good.
664;The rest of the crew just made you laugh.
665;Also the storyline was quite realistic and the stunts were excellent.
666;With Ben Affleck in it too, it made the perfect girls.
667;this is an action movie, pure and simple.
668;Billy Bob Thornton playing NASA executive director Dan Truman turns in a believably impressive performance and leaves me wanting to see him in more scenes.
669;top love subplot which begins the movie with Willis [Harry S. Stamper] literally taking shots at his daughter's [Liv Tyler] bed mate [Ben Affleck] establishes the tone for this flick.
670;Very little of what followed was believable even in a fictionalized, fantasy sort of way.
671;the premise of this film and the talent on hand made this a potential powerhouse epic.
672;To those who seem to expect realism, factuality, and political correctness (not that pc is realistic) to always come out of Hollywood, what are you thinking?While the movie has plot flaws and is wholly predictable, it contains one thing critics most often snub their noses at today: optimism, and a happy ending.
673;The tone of the film, as well as the christological subplot (a popular plot which can be found in the Matrix also) was refreshing in light of the many morose, dark, and otherwise nauseating movies of 1998.
674;This is perhaps the best example of modern special effects technology in existence.
675;I am a big fan of Affleck and Willis, and I am a big fan of action films.
676;Yes, Armageddon is, in my humble opinion, one of the best efforts in special effects ever on film.
677;So despite my awful review, I do recommend it for fans of special effects.
678;The effects in the movie were wonderful!
679;Love the concept and special effects.
680;I want to say that Michael Bay is probably one of my favorite directors in Hollywood along with Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderberg, and James Cameron.
681;it's just that sometimes I just like to watch a fun, action.
682;And thats what Michael delivers.
683;"I highly recommend his best movie ""The Rock"" after watching this movie."
684;Armageddon delivers everything this kind of movie should.
685;Action, amazing special effects, humor, and a little romance.
686;I also recommend, The Island, War of the Worlds, Oceans Eleven and Twelve, and the underrated masterpiece Empire of the sun.
687;You've got an excellent cast including Liv Tyler, Brue Willis and the rest of his crew, a believable real life senario, plenty of action, a little romance, and you might even shed a tear.
688;This movie is lots of fun, so take it as entertainment, get the popcorn and enjoy, and it may help you overlook the abserdness of the movie.
689;This movie had it all, the sexy men and the action.
690;The movie had lot of humor with serious stuff.
691;I'll start by saying that I had really high expectations for this movie.
692;This must be one of the worst movies of all time, the idea is good, and was portrayed quite well in ''deep impact''(although it was hated by people, I really liked it.)
693;Anyone who really gets genuinely upset about this must be pretty sad.
694;The best thing about the whole movie was the music and score.
695;All you people that complain about movies need to remember that they are merely a form of entertainment.
696;the special effects are pretty good.
697;despite the many flaws in the movie, I enjoyed it.
698;And that is what I really care about from most movies I watch .
699;I want to be entertained and this movie gave me what I wanted in that respect.
700;This movie is sooooooooooooooooo great.
701;my fav people in the whole world star in this move Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis.
702;Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).
703;day countdown it's going to be very, very close.
704;The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's.
705;breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie.
706;As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies.
707;It's exciting, colorful entertainment, and none.
708;This is one movie besides Ever After that I will watch more than once.
709;No matter what we do they want us to be happy even if it means sacrificing their happiness or life for it.
710;So stop wanting material things because in the end the only thing that is going to keep you alive or give you the will to live is the people that you love such as your family or friends.
711;This movie is pure Hollywood but is very fun and has a nice story.
712;This is great to enjoy with family and the wife.
713;Always a pleasure to watch.
714;Has action, romance, a little sci fi, comedy.
715;This is a classic from the very beginning to end.
716;All Star cast great character acting.
717;And I can go on and on about this movie.
718;He does however, star in Unbreakable with Bruce Willis.
719;The ending is very touching and Bruce Willis is just as good as ever.
720;I have yet to see a Bruce Willis movie that I don't like.
721;The film opens with the twin towers standing proud and tall in New York City.
722;But the film is a lot more interesting when seen ten years after its shooting.
723;The world can be saved by the human race itself.
724;I personally have the impression that the film is ten years old and that in Hollywood they could ten years ago still produce such films that are definitely slightly male chauvinistic with just a light, very light touch of female liberation if not only female presence to avoid any gay ambiguity.
725;Okay, I admit, you do remember seeing something like this.
726;If you want rough neck action, spectacular special effects, and a little something for the ladies, check out Barney.
727;Loved the film, a fun action flick with lots of silliness and fun effects typical of Micheal Bay.
728;Love this movie and the deal.
729;i am happy to find the items I want available at such great prices.
730;I am perfectly aware that part of the mission for the Criterion Collection is to promote an awareness and appreciation for, not just old or overlooked masterpeices, but also contemporary films which fit certain niches.
731;"I'm also all for recognition of the place ""summer"" movies in cinema
732;Granted some of the specials with The Rock are actually pretty cool, but God, a music video with Aerosmith?
733;I'm sure we all have those movies that we loved when we were kids that still hold special places in our heart.
734;Having said that, I would still argue that Armageddon is possibly Michael Bay's second best film after The Rock.
735;if anything Armageddon is a fun movie.
736;A large part of the reason for this is the cast, in particular Stamper's team of oil drilling misfits which includes: Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Ken Hudson Campbell.
737;The interactions between these roughnecks and the scientific community at NASA is what brings out a lot of the humor in the story, and the script co. written by JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Fringe, Star Trek, Mission Impossible 3) mines that territory for all that it's worth.
738;Her """"performance"""" ruins an emotionally climactic scene toward the end of the movie."""
739;all in all this is a serviceable movie, a lot of fun with great magnetic characters.
740;For that reason I give it a partial recommendation, and that's still largely for nostalgia's sake.
741;"Armageddon is one of those movies that have ridiculous science scenes, retarded plotlines, and horrible acting
742;There are, however, redeeming qualities to the movie.
743;michael Clark Duncan steals every scene in which he appears.
744;His tough guy with mental issues is spot.
745;fiddle is a perfect compliment to the stars of the show.
746;Liv Tyler is beautiful and competent as usual, playing the daughter to Bruce Willis, the most experienced driller on the planet, and a guy who rules with a little laissez faire and a little iron fist.
747;overall, the movie is decent, and the lesser known actors provide real entertainment.
748;Yes, this movie is good, if not great!After seeing Armageddon on satellite, I am hooked for life.
749;I liked the movie so much, I went out and bought the Criterion Collection version.
750;It is worth every penny, especially for the extra footage of Billy Bob Thornton.
751;don't get me wrong, Armageddon is not """"2001:A Space Odyssey"""", but it is a lot more entertaining."""
752;Armageddon is pure fun and entertainment.
753;It is the granddaddy of major studio, big budget, summer blockbusters.
754;Armageddon, I thought, was one of my top 10's of 1998.
755;It has it all, a superb cast, a great story, superb special effects, and without a doub the best sound editing to date.
756;With a cast of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Will Patton, Liv Tyler,Peter Stormare, Michael Clark Duncan Jr, Owen Wilson, and of course, Billy Bob Thorton.
757;Yes we could go on and on about how none of the things that happen in the movie are practical but I do find it entertaining.
758;"I love the actors and I love the Aerosmith song ""What Kind Of Love Are You On"" that they play in the strip bar scene."
759;I just have to do my small part to counteract reviews below on what a great movie this is.
760;The special effects are top.
761;Script and character development are above average for this type of film.
762;The storyline is extremely interesting and the movie's pacing is packed with edge.
763;seat suspense, with just enough deadpan comedic relief.
764;"good ""John Wayne"" and considering this is sci."
765;"And after ""reading between the lines"" of these reviews, I see a pattern of thought."
766;"the underlying ""theme"" of ""Armageddon"" is simply that for the most part, Americans."
767;in addition to American values and technology.
768;courage, heroism, patriotism, both stubborn individuality AND one.
769;There is a certain type of liberal/artsy, anti.
770;It is a fun ride with with a great sound track and cast.
771;This was the biggest hit of the year it was released for good reason.
772;I watch a movie to escape and be swooped away from reality and that is what Armageddon does very well.
773;There have been presented very clever ways to address the scientific incongruity in the film by supporters, and lists of fallacies by those driven crazy by them.
774;This film is valuable purely as entertainment for entertainment's sake.
775;A viewer can either enjoy it as such, or they should move on and find another movie.
776;There are plenty of art films out there to tickle our intellect.
777;This movie tickles the adrenal gland and sense of humor.
778;That is what the filmmakers set out to do, and they succeeded admirably.
779;That said, prepare yourself for a pretty good film.
780;Special effects are superb and there is a more than a few warm moments.
781;The ending is predictable but still very touching.
782;But this third one, Armegeddon takes the cake.
783;A special effects/action movie, which it's special effects are the only reason to watch, no matter how horribly acted it is.
784;Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler star in this movie.
785;This is one of the best Bruce Willis films to date.
786;Great cast, and special effects throughout movie.
787;Willis is regarded as the best offshore driller in the world.
788;"there are some neat moments in the film, such as the group singing ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" and the actual space scenes are good as well."
789;This is a good action packed, fun film to watch more than once.
790;"It's very entertaining, loud and sappy
791;Bay is the best director for this.
792;He has a gift for the action scenes as well as the emotion.
793;The Criterion Collection is full, and I do mean full, of extras and documentaries.
794;I feel that the movie did a phenomenal job of developing the story"
795;while it is a simple story, the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot into a 2.
796;"The movie incorporates a ""gloom and doom"" plot with a second story of love, romance, and hope."
797;"age"" relationship with the seemingly perfect love that young people share coupled with a resentful father who seems to not want to lose his daughter."
798;While the plot is superb, the acting in the move is just so.
799;I give the movie 5 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and develops them into a great plot, not the acting in the movie.
800;That part always brings tears to my eyes.
801;It is my favorite movie.
802;I turned everything way up and played this movie and felt like I was in the theatre.
803;I have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
804;There are very few movies that even try to touch on almost every emotion and this one does it well in my opinion.
805;They are meant for their entertainment value and this is full of it.
806;There is action, comedy, drama, suspense, and a little horror.
807;This is the thing: Armageddon was made as a Summer blockbuster, meaning: to have fun, to entertain and give a good time for your money.
808;This is a more honest film, which shows how good .
809;michael Bay is, how it is done when making a hit is meant.
810;I think that's the best way to describe Bruce's 1998 action.
811;And that makes it so much more unique and fun to watch because no other end.
812;"Instead, ""Armageddon"" removes itself from the equation and the producers, writers and director were all intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie, and people want to be entertained."
813;Bruce played this role as he did any of his other signature characters with perfection and precision.
814;Even though he wasn't in every scene (there is a very long list of very talented actors in this, including Ben Affleck) his presence could always be felt.
815;Only a very generous and humbled man could accomplish such an endeavor.
816;the audio commentry is the best thing about the first disc.
817;the unrated footage was pretty cool, also.
818;if you liked the movie and want to find more about it, this is the best way to go.
819;Also, love Steve Tyler's kid AND music!
820;It has got a great plot, excellent special effects, and a hint of romance to it.
821;Liv Tyler absolutely makes the movie while Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, and the supporting cast do a terrific job of keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat.
822;ray and well you know . . .
823;Will keeps you entertained for a couple of hours .
824;with lots of action scenes and good story.
825;The plot of this movie is absolutely amazing, and the acting is great too.
826;If you are looking for a great action adventure movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, though, this movie is for you.
827;fi movie but I loved the action and the roles the actors played.
828;It is entertainment and not a science lesson and from that aspect I enjoyed it.
829;Now an asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards the Earth and it will arrive in only 18 days.
830;this movie is funny, exciting, and full of action.
831;It is not the best movie out there but it is so entertaining that it makes up for its shortcomings.
832;star cast with Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan.
833;If you like action movies that have some humor in them and where the geeks save the world then this one is for you.
834;A entertaining Movie, you kind of know what is going to happen.
835;when you know every step of the way what is going to happen, it takes the enjoyment out of it.
836;the movie looks good and the special effects are impressive, yet the movie is boring.
837;"It had the right amount of humor, drama, and ""feel good"" ending."
838;It had a great cast and overall it was a very enjoyable movie.
839;"From what I've read, this was one of those ""hate it or love it"" movies and I really liked the movie."
840;If you want a to watch an entertaining movie, this is one of the best I've seen.
841;style music video, as if the filmmakers wanted to prevent you from taking a better look.
842;The usual world in peril and average Americans have to save it.
843;"At the end of the movie, Harry says to AJ, ""I've always thought of you as a son."""
844;"The acting is solid
845;Absolutely, but it only adds to the fun of the film!
846;In particular, the directors cut of the film offers some much needed heart.
847;This movie is amazing .
848;I have always loved it.
849;Love all the actors in this movie.
850;I thought it was a great mix between comedy and action, but the thing that caught my attention the most was the directing.
851;I rank him up with the likes of John Woo and Brian De Palma.
852;Just throw in some popular good.
853;Mix in a lot of pyro and loud music and you have yourselves a winner!
854;Great Condition as described in the ad.
855;I watched this so many times, and love the movie.
856;Michael Bay is an awesome director, and Love the movie he did about an astroid coming to Earth.
857;He has an grudge against the Earth.
858;These guys are hilarious and the biggest bunch of misfits that could possibly be requested to save all of mankind.
859;the action is intense, the drama (at times) palpable, the laughter uproarious, and the sentiment heartfelt.
860;all it is, is just to park your Brain at the Door and enjoy it.
861;It came out during the same time as the other Asteroid movie """"Deep Impact"""" in 1998 but this is the more successful of the two movies, i remembered when i was 16 when this came out and i loved it as it became one of my all time favorite movies."""
862;"The acting is superb including the music by Trevor Rabin with fantastic special effects, this is one of Bay's finest movies while ""Transformers"" is his greatest achivement but this is an emotional rollercoaster ride with tears, laughs, action and of course feel good material that makes this a must see ride for everyone."
863;"reel, deleted scenes, storyboards and production drawings, analses of the special effects, production designer on the look of Armageddon, Aerosmith music video on the popular ""I Don't want to miss a thing"" and trailer, teaser with TV Spots."
864;Thankfully, all the actors (especially Bruce The Sixth Sense Willis) have redeemed themselves with better movies since then.
865;Unlike other great testosterone movies.
866;can you go to that individual chapter and watch it by itself.
867;It is, and the film has a couple of winking acknowledgements of its own silliness.
868;Armageddon was one of the most popular movies of 1998, and it was a defining element of the popular culture of the time.
869;personally, I felt that Armageddon's most interesting cinematic characteristic is Bay's use of a kind of cinematic short.
870;but the best example of this shorthand is the character of Billy Bob Thorton.
871;With just this flash of visual information, Bay has established an entire history for the character.
872;Anyone who says that Bay is lacking in cinematic skills is ignoring his great gift at conveying information in a fast, visual way.
873;A great example of showing, not telling.
874;"Many of the cast members also contribute to the commentary
875;Bruce Willis is as laconic as his reputation would suggest, but his few comments are sometimes hilarious.
876;This version of the movie is also slightly extended, with some scenes involving Willis' character's father, and a few slight extensions that add character beats to some of the minor scenes.
877;the second disc has lots of interesting features on the making of the movie, a collection of deleted scenes and a few bloopers.
878;Most of the deleted scenes are comedy bits with the actors riffing in character, and all of them are entertaining but it is easy to see why they were cut out.
879;If you enjoyed this movie back in the late 90s, you'll find plenty to still enjoy here.
880;Sure its lacks the emotional heart of deep impact but when you look at the special affects and one liners and this film kicks ass, and at the end of the day its not ment to be thought provoking its good old entertainment.
881;interesting concept using a well drilling team to place charges on a large asteroid.
882;the special effects are a little more spectacular than those on Deep Impact, yet the scenes on the meteor itself are a little bit unreal.
883;the cast is an interesting broad spectrum of characters, many whom have come into their own since Armageddon.
884;I think for special effects and action Armageddon is much better than Deep Impact, yet the plot and story of the latter is much better.
885;armageddon though does show a group of very tough men with a challenging job ahead of them, taking things both in stride and with a sense of confidence.
886;In True Bruckheimer fashion this movie explodes at the beginning and just keeps going.
887;i had absolutely no problem with this selection and it is well worth owning.
888;This movie has everything you could want from an action movie and makes you feel damn patriotic!
889;Nothing in it makes any sense!
890;Then the Russian space station randomly explodes just to keep things moving.
891;Come on, guys, how entertaining can this movie be when you can't even tell what's going on most of the time?
892;Also like Independence Day, it is a lot of fun.
893;There are a number of things I found particularly amusing.
894;The rest of the drillers also seem to earn far more that their real.
895;I also liked the pro NASA and pro Space Program plugs that keep popping up (Thornton is excellent).
896;This movie was a great movie with many great characters.
897;The storyline was great and one of the best science fiction movies I have seen.
898;It had a great ending even though there were tears at the end.
899;I bought the criterion version of this movie a while ago, and I have to say it was worth the money.
900;I can't say picture wise if it's better, but it has some really cool extras.
901;Most people seem to hate it, but it has some really funny stuff in it.
902;The movie to me is one of the best you'll find.
903;There is hardly a dull moment in this movie and it is one that I highly recommend.
904;One of my favorites of all time.
905;Oh, and get the criterion one!
906;It was fun and you damn well know it.
907;This movie didn't attempt to do any but entertain with humor and great special effects and it succeeded"
908;so it's a fun romp.
909;The Criterion Collection added all the things that a true movie buff likes:.
910;The gag real alone is worth the extra money.
911;the real line was: (Billy Bob Thornton's Voice) We bring the world's best deep core driller.
912;The gag real line is: (Billy Bob Thorton's Voice) We bring in Bruce Willis, the best deep core driller in my a##.
913;The rest you'll have to see for yourself.
914;I guarantee that it is well worth it.
915;By the way, I was happy to see Paris destroyed by a stray asteriod.
916;ArmageddonScore: 74/100If you are making an explanation of the ingredients that an 100/100 film would need, it is best not to use Armageddon's flavours.
917;But, if you are making an explanation of pure entertainment at it's best, then Armageddon is a great example to use.
918;This film opened up to the world as a major blockbuster with Razzie potential from some critics.
919;goer's, like myself, happened to enjoy this film, and as a shooting star of a moneymaker, Armageddon soars high in the universe.
920;They enlist the help of Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb.
921;But those things are quite minor, and great performances from Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck .
922;especially Tyler, as the beautiful and Earthly young girl who sends her two most important men into sport .
923;All these actors play their roles well, and each have more faith in the story than some of the other main stars alone.
924;Michael Bay controls his crew well, and he works excellently with the special effects team to create a stunning view of space, and some awesome blasting sounds that will unnerve you.
925;on adventure nicely and without struggle.
926;Among these brave men 2 of the cutest guys, Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, are united, despite their private differences!
927;The long journey to the asteroid gets more and more gripping and exciting with the dangerous complications they have to get through.
928;Will they be successful in their prideful mission???
929;All in all we adore the film with its emotional scenes and its beautiful, moving music.
930;You can really enjoy the film and its a good idea for an evening with your friends.
931;The drillers were funny at times of course, the brewing romance between Bruce's daughter his drilling colleague adds a little spark.
932;Anyway, it's entertaining just the same.
933;This is one of those movies I can watch over and over!
934;Great music in this movie, and great story line!
935;The world's hope rests on the backs of a group of the best oil drillers in the world.
936;although I do not consider this film a classic, it is still an amazing movie which everyone should watch.
937;The music and special effects are top.
938;notch and the plot keeps you on your toes throughout the entire film.
939;"This was exactly the kind of reaction that Touchstone Pictures was no doubt hoping for, so that maybe their upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration called ""Armageddon"", starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler would find a much bigger audience, a more welcome reception, and hopefully gain huge box office success while avoiding the pitfall of its predecessor."
940;The impressive visuals, along with the dramatic, emotion.
941;filled story, and talented cast of actors combined with Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to produce excellent action films, and Michael Bay's sleek sense of style and high.
942;octane direction made this the must.
943;see action film of the year.
944;the story though implausible, was very solid and highly enjoyable.
945;The comedic elements sprinkled throughout served as nice reprieves from the intensity of the rest of the picture.
946;"Excellently written by J. j. Abrams (""Alias"" and ""Lost"") and Jonathan Hensleigh, ""Armageddon"" did a wonderful job of balancing visually stunning special effects sequences with plenty of story and character development, which no doubt served to make this one of the biggest disaster movies of all time."
947;"star ensemble cast of characters led by Bruce Willis was comprised of an impressive array of acting talent
948;Every actor made each character fun and engaging, taking full advantage of whatever screen time his or her respective characters were given no matter how small.
949;No character felt wasted or underdeveloped, and each actor/actress was given a decent character arc to make their characters more believable and accessible to the audience.
950;the visual effects were some of the best I had seen at the movies up to that time.
951;Every visual effects action sequence was masterfully put together, firmly cementing Bay's place as one of the best action directors of all time.
952;Armageddon is the type of 'end.
953;The movie is extremely entertaining, and features an emotionally moving story that will take you on a ride that you won't soon forget.
954;If your IQ is less than the number of fingers I am holding up, (I am holding up 3 fingers), then you probably love this movie.
955;Loud noises"
956;fI fan, I thought that Armageddon was great.
957;In spite of that, it has extreme appeal to the emotions.
958;One minute you are laughing and the next you are crying.
959;correctness is a bit over the edge.
960;It is just a fun movie, not a political debate.
961;fi movies like Star Wars Episode I. armageddon is what it is.
962;It's an entertaining, visually impressive, over.
963;And with smart actors like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, and (arguably) Ben Affleck, it's smarter and funnier than most other big brash blow.
964;Maybe you'll loosen up a bit and enjoy big flashy Hollywood movies for what they are: entertainment.
965;I really liked this movie.
966;i really liked the actors.
967;There were all awesome!I believe this movie is one of my top 10 movies.
968;This film has many good cast and sound.
969;I think this film makes audience a figure of fun.
970;There have been a million movies made with that combination.
971;This film is average at best.
972;A very good disaster movie with intense action packed scenes.
973;The special effects were great.
974;Everyone could find something as there was action, humor, romance, and emotional moments.
975;One of my all time favorites.
976;I watch it a few times a year just because it makes me laugh.
977;The movie is what it is.
978;Simply put, a great movie.
979;I went to see this movie because of the special effects!
980;The plot was good too, better then ID4!
981;Come on people, enjoy the eye candy and go see some other movie if your looking for the great plot.
982;therefore, if all you want is a special effects extravaganza movie with a loud soundtrack, this is the movie for you.
983;budget stars, cue overpowering musical score!
984;All right, now explode stuff!
985;"Maybe one of these days we'll get a decent treatment of ""Lucifer's Hammer"" on the silver screen, but this is most definitely not it."
986;"I'm sure it was an ""homage"" or something, right?"
987;The cast of supporting characters is our usual colourful melange, all gleefully portrayed by solid character actors.
988;First the Movie, if you go into this movie looking for something deep and meaningful or looking for reality based drama will be dissapointed.
989;paced ride, you will love it.
990;It looks and sounds good.
991;Just relax and watch the movie.
992;sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
993;This was a very fun and entertaining movie.
994;The cast did a great job!
995;It was action packed and suspenseful.
996;note: For all those smart as# reviewers out there.
997;You will feel like 90% of the other American's out there that enjoyed the movie.
998;Im a huge Bruce Willis fan.
999;otherwise, its an awesome movie.
1000;Armageddon and Deep Impact bear a striking resemblance to each other.
1001;"They are both big budget US ""summer"" movies."
1002;In Armageddon, the emphasis is more on the amazing special effects and the gung.
1003;well,you have to watch and see it for yourself.
1004;I loved everything about this movie.
1005;The better of 2 killer asteroid movies that came out the same time (yeah, yeah.
1006;action/explosions for the guys and love.
1007;I will cry everytime I see this movie!
1008;It is rare to find such an action.
1009;packed movie that will also bring you to tears!
1010;octane film filled with action and humour.
1011;Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi are good make a great supporting cast and add some well.
1012;Silly and jingoinistic in parts, it's still a great action film as only Bruckheimer could deliver.
1013;loves this movie and really like this version, I recomend this version to everyone, you won't be disapointed in what you get
1014;Easily one of Bruce Willis's best roles ever.
1015;It's actually one of the better Armageddon type movies.
1016;On a widescreen TV, Criterion's Armageddon provides black bars above, below and side to side yielding a postcard view of the big screen action.
1017;heroic movies any more, with the exception of cartoon stories.
1018;This is particularly true for male stars.
1019;This is a heroic story, with heroic characters.
1020;It's one of my favorites, and I watch it from time to time to get my mind right.
1021;If you enjoy good stories, with characters that you care about, and are inspired by heroic deeds, this one's for you.
1022;The cast of Armageddon is phenomenal!
1023;They interact so well with each other and make you feel like you are actually in the movie.
1024;Ben Affleck is adorable as A. j., and teams up very well with Bruce Willis.
1025;I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone!
1026;This movie was the best movie I have ever seen.
1027;It had action, it was funny, sad, and dramatic.
1028;And what a perfect topic they chose to accomplish their goal!
1029;Wheeeeee, what great fun, and lots of cool explosions too!
1030;"If you want to see a good Bruce Willis film, I recommend 16 Blocks"" ."
1031;the movie is pure eye candy and fun.
1032;Every Ad, to the intricate details of the special effects.
1033;One of my favorite hero movies with Aerosmith theme!
1034;This is a very good science fiction story about a meteor that may or may not kill all life on the planet.
1035;Lot of good actors as well
1036;action blockbusters, Armageddon actually succeeds at entertaining and producing a very enjoyable movie.
1037;the acting is great .
1038;the characters are great, and it is a literal roller.
1039;But despite my synicism and hatred of Hollywood garbage, I really enjoyed the movie .
1040;the FX were awesome and it did do a good job of showing how people will give their lives to do something for the good of all people.
1041;Billy Bob Thorton, Ben Afflek, Steve Buscimi deliver great acting.
1042;this movie is a blockbuster that succeeds .
1043;Armageddon serves as effective action movie, a very effect romance movie, and all.
1044;fi/disaster movie plot as a medium via which to deliver an action romance movie.
1045;The romance in Armageddon is done well, with Bruce Willis's daughter and one of his crew being involved in a passionate love affair that is going on underneath daddy's nose.
1046;The 'disaproving father' dynamic isn't the most original but makes an interesting emotional angle, especially at the end.
1047;The effects in armageddon are good, but the movie is more centered around the action.
1048;You'll see some nice CGI impacts, but most of the effects are space based here.
1049;the real way in which armageddon becomes a good movie is the way the action, romance and intermittent humor is in a very nice balance throughout.
1050;and you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once.
1051;all things considered most people will be pleased with Armageddon, whether you're looking for a fun, action movie to pass the time, or a heart throbbing romance.
1052;The end of the movie will leave you feeling satisfied, and entertained, where as the end of Deep Immpact will leave you feeling sad and disconcerted as you ponder the sobering realities of the basis of the plot.
1053;I saw this movie in the theater and everyone enjoyed it.
1054;Evil grin The thing is that this movie is great in its category.
1055;It is pure action and eye candy for the reality challenged.
1056;This is one of those movies that works much better on the small screen.
1057;it has a great cast, some memorable performances and some state.
1058;this is a better film to watch in the living room with your family and should have passed the big screen.
1059;Armageddon is the kind of film which Hollywood does best: It's fun and flashy and at the end of the film you will shed a tear and cheer!
1060;The sets on the asteroid are top notch and convey a sense of evil.
1061;The acting is better than average for this kind of genre, the editing crisp and well.
1062;paced, and the production is on the whole very slick.
1063;If you love Hollywood, and all that that implies, you will love this film.
1064;I don't care what anyone says, this movie was great!
1065;I have this movie and I have probably watched it 20 times.
1066;Every time is better than the last.
1067;I really liked this movie.
1068;It has great special effects a lot of momentum, action and emotions on a worldwide scale as well as personal.
1069;I really liked this movie.
1070;the digital features were amazing, though I must admit the astroid wasn't as real as I expected it to be.
1071;The casting director picked an amazing cast, whom worked well together.
1072;the movie was funny, sad, and a enjoyable adventure to save Earth.
1073;Bruce's goodbye scene is so touching that it feels as you are his daughter in the movie.
1074;"Even though it's a ""saving the World"" movie, it's pretty good because every character brought some feelings into it."
1075;It might not be scientifically accurate but it's a fun roller coaster ride.
1076;High def looks good with this movie and audio has a wide range.
1077;We like this movie which so good story and good musics too.
1078;I got this when it was first released on VHS.
1079;I'm a fan of all who starred in this great movie.
1080;It's touching, it's comedic, it's suspenseful, it's romantic.
1081;this movie put those three factors together and made a great movie this was the first Ben Aflek movie I ever saw and he is a great actor the story was very interesting and it came out at about the same time as Deep Impact Deep Impact wasn't a very good movie but this one was mainly due to its great story who cares if some of the stuff isn't scientific
1082;I have seen this movie probably 50 times or so in my life because I love it so much.
1083;There are SO many good actors in this and they all do an amazing job in their roles.
1084;I love the dialogue and the story line.
1085;I could easily watch this every day for the rest of my life.
1086;"She's a life sucking bitch from which there is no escape""""That's."
1087;What an action movie and a great cast .
1088;This film is about as important as speck of dirt.
1089;driven fun ride that'll have you laughing, screaming and crying.
1090;now this movie is a calculated blockbuster: There's humour for the funny Theres action for adrenaline junkies And there's a love story for romanticsNow, this movie could have been much much worse.
1091;But there are so many people involved who made the flawed script into a great entertainig movie:The cast: Bruce Willis is pretty much the coolest guy in the universe.
1092;well he's good lookin' and a fine actor.
1093;Steve Buscemi: The perfect freak.
1094;He tells the story with so much energy and those brilliant images.
1095;there are some lenghts in this movie but it's entertaining from start to finish.
1096;I would rate the movie four stars and that extra star for this incredible disc.
1097;I have watched Armaggedon on Sky before and i thought it was brilliant because of the acting and the actors/actresses.
1098;This is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen.
1099;It had me off my seat the whole time with its intensity, thrill, and emotion.
1100;It is deffenetly a must see movie.
1101;In the end all is good and well because of one brave man who saved the world.
1102;packed, fast paced, movie has it all and it keeps your attention as well.
1103;But, Armaggedon serves its main purpose.
1104;It keeps you entertained and it has all the elements that make an action movie great.
1105;Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are a lethal combination when it comes to this particular genre of movies, and I feel that is an honest compliment to admit that they are two of the best out there.
1106;"times, Roger Ebert said ""The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained."
1107;There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have ever been made.
1108;I do agree with some of the other Amazon reviewers in that Willis does his best with what he was given.
1109;If you like Michael Bay's movies (Bad Boys, Pearl Harbor) then you'll love this one.
1110;"I give it that one star for belonging to that wonderful category ""So Awful It's Fun To Watch."
1111;"scene, and the final ""daddy I love you"" from Liv Tyler."
1112;and every other line of script is a howler.
1113;and yet, it's still dumb fun, if that's what you're looking for.
1114;Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff or sci.
1115;"fi
1116;Great movie, great actors and actresses, great story that is quite plausible.
1117;generated' years (of course, with several notable exceptions).
1118;i have seen many, many wonderful movies and haven't looked back.
1119;It made a good Christmas gift for him.
1120;Such a great movie,instant classic the last time i seen it was when it was new then a few years later,its like a whole new movie great great film!!
1121;these movies include independence day, mib, the rock, armageddon, pearl harbor, wild wild west, godzilla.
1122;Sometimes because of the actors that are playing the roles make the movie funny enough, cause we know the action will be good the movie becomes good.
1123;I think armageddon was good.
1124;not very good, not great, but good, good+ maybe.
1125;and in the world of over the top blockbusters thats all you can really ask for.
1126;I really really enjoyed it the first time i saw it, now i dont as much but i am going to drive an hour and a half to get the criterion collection of armageddon for a decent price, locally its 50.00 clams ouch,i can get it for 24.96 or some similiar price.
1127;ok i liked it goodnight
1128;I surprised myself by liking this film on the whole.
1129;It does have some weak points, which I am only too happy to point out, but this is not only the most spectacular film since Titanic , it is also an example of how digital special effects can succeed in the hands of a top notch professional crew.
1130;Any child could spot it without binoculars.
1131;what puts Armageddon head and shoulders above its competition is that its makers created an escapist entertainment with wild abandon.
1132;First they created state of the art special effects.
1133;Then, instead of dwelling on their accomplishments, they edited these scenes into numerous very fast cuts.
1134;The result is a feeling of being on a thrill ride.
1135;there are four great actors in Armageddon .
1136;On the surface, they give their usual great performance.
1137;It set the tone for all future works on the subject.
1138;Mankind is now seen as able to avert anything that comes its way.
1139;Armageddon is about as good as its type of movie gets.
1140;If you have a home theater system, the audio is amazing.
1141;This is a blockbuster, not a high.
1142;Watch it for the space explosions.
1143;Watch it for Bruce Willis giving Ben Affleck a hard time.
1144;high octane director Michael Bay (The Rock, Pearl Harbor) rocks the screen at his best with producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide) in an intense action drama filled with stunning visual effects, a realistic action packed plot and a thrilling emotional bond built around all the actors.
1145;The plot is awesome even though it seems predictable now, it is a very touching, emotional action picture with stunning visual effects that is sure to keep you watching this film over and over.
1146;This film is one of my favorites, siding with Predator, T2, The Rock and The Matrix.
1147;I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is looking for an awesome movie!
1148;Just the soundtrack and Liv Tyler makes this worth watching!
1149;Great effects and great action.
1150;An asteroid the size of Texas is headed straight for our planet.
1151;Sometimes they are really good, and sometimes they are edited just enough to where you can't really see what's going on.
1152;I liked Transformers, yet I hated it also.
1153;Group of us went to see this in the theaters, and every one of us sat back and enjoyed the ride.
1154;All the action, the funny lines, the military/NASA scenes, space, explosions, and hot women were everything us boys were looking for in a movie.
1155;Even today, while I've grown up over those last 11 years, it's still a fun ride.
1156;To really enjoy a Michael Bay movie, you really do have to throw reality out the window.
1157;One of the space shuttles crash onto the rock and pieces of it were on fire.
1158;I said it, my friend laughed, and then said """"let it go."""""""
1159;And that's what ya gotta do with these types of movies.
1160;Bruce Willis plays, once again, a great apple pie eating American hero.
1161;He's just made for it.
1162;From his funny lines, to his `I won't take no for an answer' attitude, and to his sweet and protective fatherly moments.
1163;Liv Tyler is great as the `sort of angry at her father daughter, yet slightly shows it in her eyes that she loves him' daughter.
1164;She's great at the water works and definitely tries to pull the strings on mine when lets it go.
1165;Ben Affleck is definitely funny, but sometimes a little over the top.
1166;Watch some commentaries with him, especially with Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), on some movies he does, and you probably will bust out laughing.
1167;Steve Buscemi is a god of course in just about everything he does and it's the same here.
1168;I didn't like the whole space madness thing at the end with him, but still, at least he's funny.
1169;Everyone just seemed like they were having a good time making this movie and it really shows when you see the groups of guys together doing whatever they are doing at that time.
1170;It was pretty funny, but wow there were a lot of F bombs.
1171;I don't mind at all, but I'm sure most do, so be prepared.
1172;And the trailers were pretty good to.
1173;I still love this movie to this day no matter how over the top and silly it can get.
1174;"pretty loud and he said ""NO!"""
1175;with sniffles and tear wipes.
1176;Also hilarious since all the people around us started laughing with us.
1177;A fun filled, action packed thriller that still holds up and can even go up against so called thrillers of today.
1178;"Thats simple: ""Deep Impact"" SUCKS!!"
1179;The opening sequence to this movie is really good and gives a good setup for the disaster it mentioned that has happened will happen again.
1180;Good combination of action and drama make for a rather memorable movie, and the cast of actors did a great job in their roles, in my opinion.
1181;Definitely worth watching at least once.
1182;This movie has some of the cutest guys in it .
1183;And yes, I do have a thing for older men!
1184;This movie shot Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck to A. list stardom, and gave them Lord Of The Rings and Jennifer Lopez respectively.
1185;i was quite surprised to see a couple of scenes that I hadn't seen before on the video.
1186;During the segment where the astronauts get the night off, you see Oscar praying, and Harry visiting his Dad.
1187;the one with the NASA experts will be terrific on a night when I can't sleep.
1188;But the other one has Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis, which should be interesting.
1189;Anyone crying gets me going, who am I kidding!A terrific film, definitely a good one to watch for the guys or the special effects.
1190;This was an emotional, well.
1191;written, well directed and wonderful movie.
1192;The acting was phenomenal and I can not say enough for the soundtrack.
1193;I HIGHLY recommend this movie.
1194;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1195;I think that with a combination af Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Bruce Willis and other wonderful actors that it couldn't have gotten any better.
1196;Things like the end of the world bewilder and amaze me.
1197;I thought that was for special films.
1198;then I have to go and watch Appolo13 to remind myself that good space films are still made.
1199;The movie arrived on time and in good condition.
1200;minded really enjoy this movie.
1201;If you want a realistic movie about cometary evolution (which armageddon is supposed to be about) see: Deep Impact.
1202;In Deep Impact: 1: Almost all the main characters die (unusal and original for a modern film) 2: viewed through the media which is the way we would really live through such an event.
1203;8: I had a chance to think.
1204;size asteroid is about to hit Earth, and the government is at wit's end on how to prevent doomsday.
1205;It's the stuff great science fiction is made of.
1206;it was a flop at the box office but I liked it because I like Bruce Willis and he's great in this.
1207;some of the effects are good but then again not so good.
1208;The movie is loaded with the kind of humor, action, romance, guts.
1209;It offers it in both widescreen and pan.
1210;This is why the format is so popular, and in my opinion .
1211;Have fun saving the planet with this one.
1212;I give it four stars for the great cast and amusing script, and for the fact it is a great first date movie.
1213;I found this movie extremely entertaining.
1214;If you want realism, go watch The Learning Channel!
1215;Some people need to wake up, watch the movie for what it is, and enjoy it!
1216;I liked some parts of it, but I found it nearly impossible to follow some of the action later in the movie.
1217;I am a huge fan of his, and I loved The Rock which was produced by Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay.
1218;And Steve Buscemi (in a supporting role) has a few fun moments.
1219;we have never been faced with such circumstances, we have to believe that NASA would do whatever it would take to save the world, this is a well put together film, one of Willis' better movies, Thornton really shines here as does Willis who appears much more serious than his previous roles, Willis' character is as beleiveable here, his best role since the original Die Hard .
1220;the film leaves the viewer with so much emotion at the end, that you feel like you were there also that you care about these people whereas in the beginning you might not.
1221;A great film for those wanting action as well as emotion.
1222;It's a little better than Armaggedon, but not worthy to be among the other great films mentioned.
1223;I remember seeing this film in 1998 with my sisters and my uncle.
1224;"I just find that my suspension of disbelief fails me here, and I simply found myself saying, ""Yeah, right."
1225;However, that being said, the humor of the story is great.
1226;It's subtle, not in your face, and Willis, as always, has some excellent sarcastic zingers done in such a subtle way, that the laughter just sneaks up on you.
1227;When that WASN'T what happened, I must honestly say, I was both pleasantly surprised, and I cried.
1228;so while the science fiction part of it left something to be desired, the sub plot here, or in some people's minds, the actual plot, really makes this movie a tear jerker worth watching.
1229;Claiming he is only the best because he works with the best, Harry forces NASA to recruit his rag.
1230;top as it may be, works exceedingly well in presenting a combination of fast.
1231;one of the great things that Jerry Bruckheimer films are known for, outside of the well.
1232;choreographed explosive action sequences, are his talented group of actors that are brilliantly cast in their roles.
1233;And Armageddon once again proves the truth of that statement, despite a few performances here and there that apply to the contrary.
1234;toned humor and gritty, rock.
1235;solid attitude that works extraordinarily well with his character.
1236;Despite this being one of his few major release performances, Billy Bob Thornton still manages to give an excellent performance as the director of NASA who coordinates the mission to save the planet.
1237;Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler are perfect together as the film's romantic couple, though at times Affleck's performance was a tad on the wooden side, of which his acting ability has often been described by critics, but this time that being so only when he was asked to cry and near the end of the film when everyone, not just Affleck, seemed to wind down as the feature wrapped up.
1238;Singing is definitely not his strongest talent and he proves that so in this film.
1239;And the most notable and worthy highlight of the cast has to be the marvelous, facetious and humorous performance given by Steve Buscemi, who has yet to portray a role that doesn't work for him in the least.
1240;times in that their choreography and set up transcend the amazing special effects that are used to execute the sequence.
1241;drawn and clich d but with the overall tone of the film being quite entertaining, one can forgive the filmmakers for such mistakes.
1242;I have seen over 500 movies, and this movie is in my top ten greatest movies of all time.
1243;This movie is JAM PACKED with action and exciting moments.
1244;Just following along is EXHILARATING!
1245;I have seen this movie over and over and still love it.
1246;You may shed a tear over it, so keep the Kleenex handy.
1247;You gotta love a Bruce Willis action movie, and this is one the best!
1248;For the most part the films they release are wonderful, and have stood the test of time.
1249;Come on folks, even you who enjoy this movie.
1250;The characters are pure, 100.
1251;I would really love to have recorded the private discussions between Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton (both Oscar.
1252;The mix of characters is quite comical.
1253;ray version so that I could see the action sequences on a big.
1254;screen with best detail and this disc met all my expectations.
1255;Great movie I wanted in my library and can never find it on tv/sat or iTunes!!
1256;received it nice and quick:)
1257;Although for the exception of PEARL HARBOR, Director MICHAEL BAY has shown improvment every film he directs, along with his sidekick producer.
1258;mY REVIEW: ARMAGEDDON is great!
1259;This movie is perfect in every aspect!
1260;The adventure, special effects, acting and story is phenomenal!
1261;This is one of my favorite movies!
1262;This is far better than it's competitor.
1263;ARMAGEDDON is a great rush of excitment!
1264;It is also emotional, inspiring and humorous!
1265;Wow, this movie has all the qualities I want in a movie .
1266;The unique blend of actors and their characters makes Armageddon a movie I want to watch again and again!
1267;The government finds out that a huge meteor the size of Texas is going to crash into the earth.
1268;The rest of the crew gave acceptable performances.
1269;Billy Bob was tremendous as Truman.
1270;Armageddon is one of my most favorite movies of all time and it is Michael Bay's best film ever.
1271;This movie makes me laugh and cry everytime I watch it.
1272;The effects are amazing still to this day.
1273;The cast did an amazing job with their characters.
1274;This film had a very good storyline to it as well.
1275;Not many people liked this film, but I absolutely love it to bits.
1276;This movie is a testament to how the state of motion pictures is declining.
1277;They get great actors to sound excited about the perils and pitfalls of drilling into the hardest metal imaginable on an asteroid headed for earth.
1278;It is ONLY star driven, and NOT a plot driven movie.
1279;If you call it a popcorn movie deluxe, better add in plenty of cocktails with that buttery treat, and a good nap before it is over.
1280;Billy Bob, Willis, Buscemi, Duncan, and more stars, have made classic movies in their own right.
1281;Same scenario, great actors doing scenes that you couldn't dream up in a million years.
1282;name actor, huge visual fx epic extravaganza to satisfy our brain.
1283;That the movie made millions just proves the end of the world is coming.
1284;I love this movie and now I own it in every available version and format thanks to this one!
1285;If you are on the other hand the type of movie lover who likes an incredible and fun thrill ride then should make film will make your day.
1286;so take your brain out and enjoy this film for what it is.
1287;If you want truly entertaining futuristic fantasy (that is, devoid of any attempt to even hint at reality), watch The Fifth Element instead: at least that film can laugh at itself and has some good lines.
1288;watch a really worthwhile film .
1289;the acting is fantastic, gripping storyline, and extremely emotional, and why does it matter if the rocket is the wrong size to what it should be?
1290;a fantastic cast and my favourite film of all time .
1291;this film is pure entertainment and doesn't pretend to be anything other than that.
1292;What you see is what you get, a high octane, action filled, special effects packed, fun film.
1293;I greatly enjoyed the action.
1294;packed plot, witty and original dialogue, convincing and moving love story, and the nuanced performances by every single cast member involved, even the extras in the background.
1295;It's a great movie that has made some of those best selling list of movies.
1296;When the time comes it will become a classic too.
1297;It been like early 1997, but that's only a good thing.
1298;Each movie recieved good reviews.
1299;Plus, there is also a love story in all of this (naturally) between driller Ben Affleck and Willis' daughter played by Liv Tyler.
1300;Oh well, at least Armageddon is better than Pearl Harbor.
1301;but I found it rather fun to watch.
1302;There was some way out humor.
1303;I enjoyed the repetition of the main song, Diane Warren's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing .
1304;And I like the Leaving On A Jet Plane sequence.
1305;But it does move, and it did have some sort of a hypnotic effect.
1306;machine (Back to the Future eat your heart out!)
1307;kick) was a brilliant and emotional tribute.
1308;Armageddon a movie with some of the best special effects ever.
1309;The best part of this whole movie is Aerosmith playing in the background.
1310;Any movie with Bruce Willis in it is great !
1311;If you never seen it, I highly recommend it.
1312;This movie was amazing from start to finish.
1313;Full of amazing actor's, great music and sound, and covers all category's (comedy, drama, suspense, etc.) A definite keeper for your video collection.
1314;First of all, I must go on record as one of the only people who actually loves this movie.
1315;Well, I have a simple theory.
1316;When you see a movie in a theater, the way the audience watching it with you reacts has a huge effect on how YOU take the film.
1317;The audience I saw it with in the theater took it SERIOUSLY.
1318;Usually when A Criterion Collection movie is produced, it's of a classic and important film.
1319;this movie is fun, but the story is week.
1320;Very good cast, very good plot!!
1321;This is definitely one of the best films of the 90's!
1322;The fact that there is so much at stake, such as the sake of mankind, the love of Liv's with her boyfriend and the life of the GREAT as always Bruce Willis makes it really interesting and worth to watch!
1323;I recommend it to any film collector!!!!
1324;I have watched this film several times, I always enjoy it.
1325;Great Cast, and of course Bruce Willis, sit back and enjoy
1326;Its her favorite movie and she was so excited when it came in the mail.
1327;One of the best movies made in my opinion, action, love, thrilling, all in one, Bruce Willis is great, Liv Tyler wonderful .
1328;Loved all of the songs, including I'm leaving on a Jet Plane.
1329;Great action and great emotion design.
1330;My son and I love this movie very much.
1331;Nature created mankind, nature may create something else that might better fit the new environment other than mankind.
1332;My attidute is enjoy every single minute that you have!
1333;this movie is one of the best of all time.
1334;Sure the plot is a little unbelivable at times but the over all movie is a great one.
1335;Great story and acting, I enjoy this show no matter how many times I watch it.
1336;Highly recommend it to anyone.
1337;This is an old classic movie that recommend to anyone who likes action movies , one of Michael bays classics.
1338;This movie is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen.
1339;An asteroid is discovered and we have 17 days until it hits.
1340;There is absolutely *no* way a mission such as this could be planned, trained.
1341;In the open of the movie, New York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death and injury.
1342;In Armageddon, this scene is presented as eye.
1343;"The amazing ""gravity"" on the asteroid."
1344;The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie.
1345;"I can accept ""The Force"" and other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own reality."
1346;This film was definitely action.
1347;Otherwise, this film had plenty of action and explosions and some decent acting.
1348;Buscemi was wonderfully funny throughout and I'm pretty sure there's a law that says that Michael Clark Duncan has always and always will remain awesome for all eternity.
1349;i'm pretty sure it's in there.
1350;I also liked Billy Bob Thornton as he played a great straight.
1351;So, the film is full of mistakes, but it's still pretty awesome and I watch it regularly.
1352;I recommend you do the same.
1353;this was a great movie.
1354;I liked Bruce in just one, ONE, of his many films .
1355;Sixth Sence, he actually did a good face there .
1356;and up to recently, for some reason I just can't find, he has been offered many great film.
1357;star that he actually is, compare him to Sean Penn, Robert De Niro.
1358;Well, this is my opinion on him as one of the highest paid actors today anyway, I'm sure he's a nice guy .
1359;This is one of my favorite action.
1360;adventure movies of all time.
1361;Throw in a group of equally skilled misfits and a love story subplot between Ben Affleck and Bruce's daughter, and non.
1362;stop action with killer special effects and a soundtrack to match, and you've got a great evening's entertainment.
1363;the visual effects are quite good, and the audio is outstanding, with excellent use of the subwoofer and the surrounds to create an entire sound environment.
1364;For action/adventure fans, this movie is essential.
1365;There are 18 days before impact.
1366;There is extreme humor when they bandy with Nasa medical personnel over their physical conditions.
1367;One of the drillers is in love with Harry's daughter, and Harry shoots at him with a shotgun when he catches him in bed with the daughter.
1368;the movie has action, romance, humor, drama, science fiction, tragedy, sentimentality and Biblical references.
1369;It points out the real important things in life, with the ultimate action of self.
1370;moving with excellent special effects and acting.
1371;He, along with most of the other characters, is critical in the success of the mission.
1372;He becomes a great friend of the American astronauts.
1373;The other comet movie (Deep Impact) is a lot better.
1374;THe product was in perfect condition.
1375;ben Affleck,Liv Tyler,Billy Bob Thornton,Will Patton,Keith David,Peter Stormare are all very good in the film,but it's Steve Buscemi's comic relief that drives this extravaganza!
1376;Subtract Mr. Buscemi from the mix and the moviewould be no better than average.
1377;i've never seen a film that made saving the planet quite so fun!The Criterion Edition of the film is worth the extra pesos or bucks they charge.
1378;up job,the video trasfer is terrific,the added film footage lifts the movie even higher,and the extra disc with the supplementary material is the crowning jewell!
1379;If you liked the original movie,you'll like this director's cut better!
1380;I thought Armageddon ranked right up there with Godzilla!
1381;As far as special effects go and entertainment, Armageddon was a joyride from start (well from mission start to finale) to finish.
1382;Well anyway, I especially liked the Russian Space Station sequence.
1383;seriously has got to be shredded lest it be unearthed centuries from now.
1384;What a great movie, funny and full of action.
1385;Michael Bay is what he is the same as Hitchcock directed psychological thrillers or George Lucas directs science fiction.
1386;packed and quite frankly, fun to watch.
1387;It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the main roles.
1388;The supporting cast is underrated, well.
1389;It's a movie that's made for sheer fun, for entertainment, for bringing your family to enjoy a couple of hours of action, thundering explosions, fast vehicles and a little romance.
1390;Stop whining and enjoy yourself.
1391;The world only has 18 days until impact.
1392;For that, NASA recruits the worlds's best deep.
1393;The crew, along with some NASA astronauts and an unlucky Russian cosmonaut, journey to the asteroid and embark upon the mission to destroy it and with that, save the entire planet.
1394;The movie is filled with a few emotional moments that will bring tears to some eyes.
1395;The score is grandiose and is a large part of the film.
1396;The film strives to be patriotic and the cinematography reflects it.
1397;I couldn't help but feel patriotic and moved while watching the movie.
1398;It's fun, it's moving, it's sad and it's romantic.
1399;Above all, it's one of the more entertaining movies I have seen.
1400;The cast had a lot of chemistry together and seemed to have a lot of fun which is reflected in the film.
1401;office action movie and he gives a good first effort.
1402;Bruce Willis takes on the role of Harry Stamper with ease like the action movie veteran he is.
1403;Liv Tyler is sweet as Harry's daughter and their emotional goodbye is to be remembered.
1404;(Home theater aficionados will also appreciate the visual and sound effects in this movie).
1405;highest grossing film of 1998 narrowly behind Saving Private Ryan.
1406;See the movie, it's a blast.
1407;I'll admit: I've seen both DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON and I have to say both of them are great and unique (I just can't decide between the two!)
1408;Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Liv Tyler are all excellent with their roles.
1409;The visual and sound effects were pretty good, too.
1410;Michael Bay did a wonderful job directing this film (which was probably a hard film to direct) and the cast and crew of this film should be given more credit because this film really is excellent whether you like these kind of movies or not.
1411;It's just a fun, popcorn type film.
1412;I'm glad that I saw it and you should all give it a chance!
1413;One of my favorite movies.
1414;Cheer, boo and hold you breath.
1415;There is something intangible about this movie that makes it a classic.
1416;But I know it's a great movie.
1417;this is one of those movies to watch when you don't feel like tackling a new movie.
1418;there's a new movie I just thought of to watch for the 25th time.
1419;Michael Bay's blockbuster is a sort of comic book brought to life, an over.
1420;stylized apocalyptic spectacle born of a generation raised on music videos.
1421;something that is especially evident in sequence after sequence edited to fit with the film's Aerosmith.
1422;Suffering greatest of all amidst all of this is the film's credibility.
1423;At its worst, it cheapens a great many potent images and potentially powerful themes with its flashy approach.
1424;I've known members of both sets of persons, and this portion of the movie spoiled it for me entirely.
1425;Want to see a better similar move, see Deep Impact, a much better work.
1426;the action was excellent, the special effects mind.
1427;shattering, and the story was fun.
1428;And anyone who likes to eat popcorn while watching a movie is sure to enjoy it.
1429;Armageddon is easily one of my favorite movies to this day.
1430;This has everything a great movie should with great action, comedy, and a good love story.
1431;I absolutely love all the characters in this.
1432;I recommend this to everybody all ages.
1433;I love this movie and would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for this packaging.
1434;all the stars were great in this movie.
1435;Armageddon is in the great tradition of silly summer fun.
1436;Armageddon, the latest from master of action films, Director Michael Bay, is a go for broke action extravaganza that serves as an example of what Deep Impact is not.
1437;This movie is full of great comic angles, touching romance, a great look in it's cinematography, and fantastic special effects.
1438;Even the performances are entertaining and convincing.
1439;But what makes Armageddon a good experience is that it's fun.
1440;There are moments of breathtaking scenery like when the shuttles fly over the moon as pieces of the asteroid crash on it's surface.
1441;Michael Bay is a skillfull director who is the best out there today in the action movie business.
1442;In the end, Armageddon delivers with thrills, spectacular visual effects, and lots of fun.
1443;If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency.
1444;Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much.
1445;The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place.
1446;There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast.
1447;For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper.
1448;kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies.
1449;With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow.
1450;This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer.
1451;Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris.
1452;There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI.
1453;One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct.
1454;Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here.
1455;This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.
1456;This is very fun action scifi, with Willis as a macho driller with a heart who sets out to save the Earth from an asteroid crash with his crew.
1457;The special effects are extremely good, with memorable scenes like the destruction of Paris, but also the landing in an alien asteroid field.
1458;There is a great subplot, in which his daughter, who stays behind, is engaged to one of his team with Willis' disapproval.
1459;A lot comes out with that little melodrama, which shocks the dad and reveals a funny side that is always present with Willis and makes his films better than most.
1460;This is not great scifi with some vision of the future, but it is adventure as solid as the asteroid core they have to drill through.
1461;There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful.
1462;this is a film that Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of.
1463;Ben Affleck is going to be a excellent young cocky movie actor, who could end up like Bruce Willis.
1464;Is it still my favorite movie?
1465;I give this movie a 5 because it has all aspects that I love in a movie: action, stars, love and a teary patriotic ending.
1466;I was entertained, and am still entertained even after having watched it dozens and dozens of times.
1467;More defined visually in high definition.
1468;Apart from the leads, Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as ever.
1469;dramatized scenes and over the top acting and characters.
1470;"i would recommend ""Deep Impact"" over this movie anytime because in my opinion, it is a more intelligent show and the focus is well."
1471;balanced between the plot and the actors.
1472;one of the saving graces of this show would be Billy Bob Thornton.
1473;Armageddon is a better flick than critics .
1474;"tough generals, brilliant scientists and a patriarchal president who looks inspired by FDR (not unlike the guy who played the president in ""The Rock"") ."
1475;are never as heroic as the rebel.
1476;"Though ""Armageddon"" relies on good special FX (which are actually spectacular) so do lots of other flicks which were nowhere near as good."
1477;Great movie I've been waiting for a blu ray of this movie.
1478;no normal human over the age of 5 can possibly enjoy this storyline.
1479;it mocks it's own self.
1480;it is guaranteed to give you a headache.
1481;"don't let the movie snobs fool you
1482;Armageddon is easily this is one of the best action flicks of the 1990's and will take any viewer back decades to old science fiction stories of the 1950's and 60's found in movies and comics.
1483;It really is traditional story telling in its purest form.
1484;It contains the perfect mix of humor, action and suspense.
1485;She loves this movie thats why I gave it five stars.
1486;This movie is awesome .
1487;loved it like the very first time.
1488;I actually love the grain on the movie .
1489;it gives it a realistic look like if I was back in the theater.
1490;Bruce Willis and company did a tremendous job in this great film about a giant asteroid threatening the Earth.
1491;Love every minute of it.
1492;The price was great, and so was the service.
1493;Bruce Willis has always been one of my favorite actors.
1494;He is very good in this movie.
1495;Am glad I got it for my collection.
1496;I know they will enjoy it.
1497;In Deep Impact, we saw an incredible tale of the best and the worst of the human being.
1498;Top scenes shows human, real, credible reactions and situations.
1499;I liked that movie and Bruce Willis was great.
1500;i truly had a grand time watching it!
1501;I bought this as a gift.
1502;Made it in great time and it was in great condition.
1503;loved watching the movie right away on my big screen tv
1504;An epic story about love and family.
1505;For example, the chinese buisenessmen that are clients of Willis' company.
1506;Two African American characters are in the entirety of the movie, one, an emotional gentle giant biker and the other is serious and by the book Air Force brass.
1507;They appeared to me to use a reasonable amount of space to make their maneuvers.
1508;If two objects collide head on, their two speeds are added together to come up with the force of impact.
1509;This movie is a Jerry Bruckheimer production which almost comes with a written guarantee that it's a well.
1510;The cinematography and the effects are excellent and it's a blow.
1511;away movie supported by a powerful soundtrack.
1512;I have to say this is one of Bruce Willis' best movies.
1513;He showed the rough and tough side of his character but when the cards were down he showed the soft side of his character very well.
1514;Its humor and its action.
1515;Bruce Wills is fun to see him agian in the genre that made him a Hollywood superstar.
1516;Ben Affleck has his moments as well This movie is worth watching for a good time just if you don't ask for too much of it.
1517;the above being said, I like Bruce Willis.
1518;If you can get around all of the absurdity in this film, and just enjoy it for the action.
1519;laden popcorn movie it is, it does have some redeeming value.
1520;More plausible, better acting, and an amazing shot of a huge comet entering Earth's atmosphere.
1521;First of all, seeing intellegent, inspired and creative works pleases me more than anything else, the feeling I get when I leave the theatre is like nothing else.
1522;crafted and yes, highly entertaining movies like the insider make $30 mil.
1523;Meanwhile, a decent cast fights for breathing room.
1524;First of all, special mention for the direction.
1525;All things considered, this movie makes Ed Wood look like a talented filmmaker.
1526;The special F/X are brilliant,but that's the movie's only saving grace.
1527;these are some of the best actors in movie history and they deliver acting that fails to impress.
1528;rated PG.13 for intense sci.
1529;fi violence, unexpected high profanity and pretty strong sex material.
1530;Well, I think Armageddon is wonderful entertainment, and I've never come across anyone in person who hasn't been enthusiastic about the film.
1531;This film oozes cheese, but man its fine gouda,and a sharp chedder.
1532;It is well made cheese,and despite a wonderful nod to the Russian space program, it is purely American cheese.
1533;michael Bay turns in great piece of work here which is not always the case, see""""BadBoys""""(stinky cheese)."""
1534;He develops characters with a minimum of exposition, and a maximum of well thought out imagery, and movement.
1535;His pacing while rapid is still smooth, and one can see and often times feel the action.
1536;"and yes there are moments of ""telecommunication commercials""but hey, they were some of the best commercials of their time."
1537;the acting is wonderful, turning what ordinarily would be stereotyped,boring characters into memorable ones.
1538;and yeah this movie can make those of us prone to, cry.
1539;Armageddon is one of my top ten movies of all time.
1540;it takes a lot to get anyone to watch a movie several times over and over, especially with the enourmous number of movies out there to chose from, but the wit and storyline just really flows together and the one liners are hilarious.
1541;Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
1542;star cast members is amazing and in my opinion, they all showed why they are all.
1543;stars, it was a great performance from everyone.
1544;fi movie for goodness sakes.
1545;A great movie with a wonderful cast!!
1546;The whole movie is a classic story that will live on!!
1547;Best Blu ray with Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis.
1548;Super story and amazing special effects.
1549;Highly recommend this film in Blu Ray.
1550;Each time I'm on the edge of my seat.
1551;I hope you appreciate these extra words you required!
1552;This was a good movie.
1553;It was more realistic than many people (commenting here) believe it to be:1.
1554;tracking budget allowing us to track only 1% of the sky is pretty accurate.
1555;It was fun and you damn well know it.
1556;Bruce Willis is one of the greats that is for sure now and forever.
1557;As far as blockbuster movies go, this one was A LOT of fun.
1558;that being said, Armageddon earns a four in my book, and for several reasons.
1559;It goes all out (WAY to the extreme) to have fun, and for this film, it works.
1560;It's big, it's loud, it's grandiose .
1561;for a summer flick .
1562;And the effects are great, that goes without saying.
1563;this movie is one of my secret guilty pleasures along with ID4 (which other ppl are coincidently putting down for lack of intelligence, but I thought did a great job for what it was supposed to do) and whenever I want to give my brain a break and just have some fun, a good laugh, and an exhilarating ride, I pop it into the VCR.
1564;~ line delivered with a completely straight face.
1565;My brother and I still crack up.
1566;oh, and Liv Tyler was absolutely gorgeous.
1567;Bruce, Ben and Billy Bob are great but this is truly a group effort.
1568;You will be captured by Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan, Green Mile) Chick (great character pulled off by impressive acting, Will Patton) and my fav, Rockhound (another tremendous performance by Steve Buscemi.)
1569;This movie is great for us guys, it has action and great sound but also pulls in a not too sappy romance (helps keep your lady happy.)
1570;The special effects are fine.
1571;"The ""story"" is a realheart."
1572;I gaveit an extra star because I think it's been panned too severely.
1573;I should be able to see every crystal in the asteroid and every hair on Ben A's face.
1574;Well, if you like Ben Affleck this flick will give you ample opportunity to drool and gush because it has plenty of beefcake hero action.
1575;i found the story to be good, but not great.
1576;but I was entertained and I liked the interaction and relationships established in the film.
1577;the beginninng sequence with the meteor shower was probaby the most enthralling and technical scene.
1578;For those that want to immerse themselves in an action / adventure movie second to none, crank up your home theatre system and let Bruce, Billy Bob, Ben, Liv and the living legend that is Steve Buscemi take you on an action packed journey to save the earth.
1579;The special effects are excellent and there is a second disc with some good commentary from the cast, producer and NASA consultants brought in to help on the project.
1580;All in all Critereon have managed to make an excellent film even better.
1581;The movie is nicely paced with great action, jaw.
1582;dropping special effects, romance, humor, amusing characters and an interesting plot.
1583;I enjoyed the interaction of Bruce and Ben's characters the most.
1584;I did enjoy a few parts.
1585;I hope this helps you.
1586;There are some talented actors here which enticed me to see it, so it was disheartening to watch them phone in their performances for a paycheck.
1587;All the right stuff for this gang.
1588;This is one of the best movies of the 1990s.
1589;It is action packed, has a good plot, and is well put together.
1590;I enjoy this movie every time that I watch it.
1591;well I have to admit.
1592;Even during the training scenes everything seems entertaining and even fun at times.
1593;You can pretty much time every single camera shot at about three seconds or less.
1594;i will admit the movie does look nice.
1595;Liv Tyler is cute and the lights and cameras are in all of the right place for some perfect poses.
1596;still the acting is very good when you actually get a chance to see it (like before the shuttle launch/MTV music video movie starts).
1597;Michael Clarke Duncan probably stands out more for me as well because of a particularly entertaining scene regarding a psych evaluation.
1598;And all the better, it is a fun, wild, free of logic, and well done.
1599;The effects were truly spectacular.
1600;If that's what you look for in a movie, then this is a must.
1601;this was on of the best action movies i have seen.
1602;the special effects were great.
1603;this movie is both funny and sad at times.
1604;extraordinarily clean transfer with no artifacts that I could see anywhere.
1605;Contrast is excellent throughout the film.
1606;Armageddon, in its own way, comes with one of the very best audios to be found.
1607;Armageddon has some of the very best ambient audio on any disc with not only front to rear but rear to front panning and a very engaging surround experience.
1608;eXTRASNot a whole lot, the Aerosmith music video, a trailer and teaser.
1609;despite the ads, the Blu Ray of Armageddon comes well recommended.
1610;This is a great movie and I would love to see it available for streaming for Prime Members.
1611;Sure, you notice it's none to bright, but the characters and the action are so entertaining that it really doesn't matter.
1612;I have seen it about four times and will probably watch it again, either to show somebody who hasn't seen it or to watch with anybody that wants to see it again as I did.
1613;This is a very exciting and heartwarming movie.
1614;Great cast, you can't go wrong with it.
1615;The ending will make you cry and cheer.
1616;I have watched this movie over and over and I love it every time.
1617;The story, the emotion, the special effects.
1618;It all flows perfectly and makes you laugh and cry and even get goose bumps at times.
1619;Bruce Willis does one of his best tough guy with a huge heart roles.
1620;watched this movie for the first time in many years via the new Blu.
1621;It's also really good, blockbuster fun that.
1622;ever example of a summer, popcorn save.
1623;Great, cheesy fun that holds up, even a decade after its release.
1624;It walks that line between action, humor and emotional excess perfectly .
1625;Unlike basically everything else director/producer Michael Bay has ever touched.
1626;Somehow they manage to deliver dialogue that would induce eye.
1627;Armageddon is far from a cinematic masterpiece.
1628;Heck, it's even far from realistic (or even roughly believable for anyone who's ever passed 4th grade science), but, despite all that, it is really entertaining and, heck, isn't that what movies are all about?
1629;gene Siskel said that you are bombarded with so much action and noise that is ultimately becomes amusing.
1630;many people say you should just relax and enjoy the show.
1631;the storyline is absolutely perfect.
1632;one of teh best movie songs is in this.
1633;Armageddon is a really great movie.
1634;It is definitely Michael Bay's best movie (I'm not sure how he went wrong with Transformers).
1635;ray conversion was well done.
1636;The disc also has some standard additional features which are good to watch.
1637;Liv Tyler may not exude acting skills, but she does a good job of showing her emotion, and giggles okay during the `animal cracker in the low plains scene' with Ben Affleck (watch the movie.
1638;this film came out about the same time as Deep Impact, another excellent `end of the world by comet' movie.
1639;a lone retiree with a huge backyard reflective telescope discovers a rogue asteroid the size of Texas.
1640;The best driller in the world?
1641;BUT they and the rest of the crew hold the fate of the world in their hands.
1642;And from there, the action, the color, the tension, and the absolutute beauty of the CG's is non.
1643;This movie is cutting edge.
1644;It is a masterpiece of light, flash, and color.
1645;shaking and has to be experienced at high volume.
1646;Probably saw to many Swedish films.
1647;Give him a beer, and he'll love this.
1648;It's a great movie even though some don't think so but that's because they didn't really watch it good and give it a chance but overall this is a great movie to watch.
1649;Thoroughly enjoyable entertainment with a good cast.
1650;I am shocked to see ANY positive reviews of this movie.
1651;this is the largest packed special features release by criterion to date at the time of release.
1652;Being the case, both the film and the special features will be reviewed.
1653;the film has good acting with an all.
1654;The movie has some excellent special effects.
1655;the special features are really good.
1656;One is with director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.
1657;It's fast paced, funny, has great effects, good characters, brilliant casting and a fun script.
1658;If you want more depth than that then watch Apollo 13, otherwise just lie back and enjoy the ride.
1659;"notch special effects and a cast of some of Hollywood's best actors including Bruce Willis, ""Armageddon"" would go on to be the top grossing film of 1998 and gross nearly $600,000,000."
1660;"It was also one of Michael Bay's first films in which he directed, and the success of ""Armageddon"" would allow Bay to direct many remakes of former Hollywood horror films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Fog""."
1661;I've managed to accept it at my first visit in theater.
1662;The diagnoue r very cartoony that actually help a lot to digest the whole picture, since the whole show is like a big cartoon.
1663;Once u beyond that point, the whole show is really joyful, MTV grabage my ass, it rocks and thrill and its all that matter.
1664;"The only thing that distingulish good movies from bads is, it doesnt matter which way they plot and design the show, the question is just ""how much"" can they pull off from the emotion they are trying to deliver originally, this movie is about rocking fun with space as its background and they do hit it right for me."
1665;Just sit back and enjoy 2 hrs cinimatic fun.
1666;The movie starts with the world at the brink of destruction.
1667;Three, able to launch dock with a space station refuel and land on the object in space.
1668;great story if you have a gullible imagination, other wise it is a insult to anybody that thinks.
1669;If you want a good movie watch Deep Impact!!
1670;This film is just good fun.
1671;not really any acting, and funny as well.
1672;Jerry Bruckheimer's Armageddon is a lavishly and expertly produced space epic full of great effects and big stars.
1673;These scenes are the most entertaining in the film as we meet the various characters in their wild surroundings.
1674;Director Michael Bay does a fair job of giving each supporting character a certain cinematic flair, and non more evident than in the Steve Buscemi's character of Rockhound.
1675;There are genuine laughs here as these scenes are editing together like a music video.
1676;Affleck and Tyler are Armageddon's answer to Jack Dawson and Rose.
1677;Their romance is so unimportant to the main thrust of the film that it slows the story down.
1678;Space has a certain elgance in movies and in the right films (ie, Star Wars, Star Trek, 2010, Apollo 13) space action can be very effective.
1679;the film has some saving graces, the humor and acting are fine and the theme song from Aerosmith is very good.
1680;These guys are saving the world, and Michael Bay gives them scenes and attitudes which would be more appropriate in a beer commercial.
1681;This movie is very Michael Bay, in that it is a loud, frequently, and very visually intense.
1682;okay, so we turn to acting.
1683;He gives a fine, if slightly stiff perforance to lead this movie.
1684;Granted, for a summer popcorn.
1685;"bending linguistic feat of referring to ""Independence Day"" as ""restrained"" in a sincere fashion, which should tell a potential viewer a lot."
1686;Should you feel the need to watch a disater flick, please by all means avoid Armageddon.
1687;how great to see this in a format that is so much better!Yeah for the digital world.
1688;and Bruce Willis (with a great cast)!!!
1689;in order to plant an explosive inside the middle of it (?)
1690;Bruce Willis stars in an adequate performance as the leader of the ragtag team of riggers, taking his team (which includes daughter Tyler and her lover Affleck) to the core of the planet's brink of elimination.
1691;While the story is so farfetched and ridiculous to be that realistic, fine performances throughout coupled with some hilarious, quirky dialogue saves this film from being a run.
1692;superb special effects, riveting and off.
1693;wall cinematography created by the one.
1694;It is a great movie indeed .
1695;story, actors, images, sound, everything is perfect.
1696;"Everybody is so proud of this family who does so much to save the world 
1697;She is so proud of him but cannot avoid a few tears.
1698;It is very moving, and an exemple of commitment and absolute love.
1699;please stop Michael Bay before he directs again.
1700;I find it truly amazing anyone could give this film anything more than 1 star (the lowest, unfortunately, Amazon allows).
1701;It really is a ZERO star flick.
1702;There is NOTHING about this film, in my opinion, that is good.
1703;like cuts and editing, and more and more and more and more of the same.
1704;Hollywood and the """"studios"""" have offered us a helluva lot of great films, despite obvious limitations and compromises."""
1705;This is a 4 Tylenol special, and have on hand plenty of eye drops.
1706;You'll enjoy yourself much more than watching this.
1707;While it has its melodramatic moments, Armageddon aims to be a fun, action packed movie that largely succeeds.
1708;I would have had two Russian cosmonauts on MIR, and one of them sneaks onto one of the shuttles, but that's just me.
1709;I won't spoil it for you, enjoy this movie because it is the best you will probably ever see.
1710;Bruce Willis soars leap years above his stereotypical action hero image and delivers a blockbuster performance.
1711;This move kept me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene!
1712;they love it and watch all the time .
1713;i enjoy this movie as well
1714;This movie is BY FAR the most amazing, spirit.
1715;Armageddon is definately my most favorite movie of ALL TIME (and it'll probably be yours, too)!
1716;This is the perfect popcorn movie.
1717;the action, the humor, and yes, the emotion.
1718;And lord knows, you can be chic and think anything about the flag or being a hero is good.
1719;after having watched this movie 100 times at least at work i can say that it is one of the worst movies ever made, which is sad because up until they go into space i find it fairly amusing.
1720;Is stretches plausible fiction to the edge, rips it apart, chews on it for a while and then spits it out matter.
1721;it's largely unprecedented in box office blockbusters!
1722;Bruce Willis plays himself, as usual, the quiet, sarcastic, my.
1723;Enjoy, live the moments, cherrish the feelings and sensory overload, forget the inconsistences and plot.
1724;This movie hits you on almost every emotion!!
1725;All those people giving this product a great review must be watching on an antique square screen TV.
1726;Still, this movie isn't horrible.
1727;The special effects are spectacular, Thorton is his usual good self, and Bruce Willis really isn't bad at all (actually, I thought his reflections and prayers while on the asteroid were the best part of the movie).
1728;Affleck and Tyler's characters will no go down as the new Romeo and Juliet, but some of their scenes are cute.
1729;I enjoyed this movie when it first came out and since then I have probably watched it a dozen times, maybe more.
1730;Well I wasn't dissappointed, it was great and have watched it four or five times since I bought it.
1731;Will keep you on the edge of your seat !!!
1732;I loved it so much more the 2nd time I saw it, I already loved it the 1st time!
1733;This movie has good action, special fx, comedy, romance.
1734;I actually think this is 1 of Bruce Willis' best movies!
1735;Bruce Willis has been making some really good movies doin some really good roles!
1736;The rest of the cast done great also.
1737;Its a true adventure everytime I watch this movie!
1738;under those situations, this is an amazing film.
1739;This is a great movie.
1740;Cheesy story line and weak love story are both over come by a great compilation of fun and interesting characters.
1741;This movie was full of great one liners and laugh out loud moments.
1742;I found myself immersed in the film and when it was over I was left wanting more.
1743;If you're one of thoes people who loves to analyze the crap out of movies then don't waste your time on this one, but if you want to sit down and just have fun, this is a great choice.
1744;I can watch this movie over and over again.
1745;This is perhaps one of the dumbest movies with a big budget of all time.
1746;If anybody is planning to make a Special Edition of a movie, this is a perfect example.
1747;a BIG documentary about the special effects.
1748;Now the sound in the movie itself was incredible.
1749;The whole movie was 5.1 digital and well earned.
1750;The overall movie was great just Liv Tyler is cute, but needs more acting experience.
1751;I can honestly say that I've yet to watch the film by itself.
1752;the four principles in the main commentary track, Director Michael Bay, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Bruce Willis, and Ben Affleck all bring in their viewpoint of what happened during the shoot.
1753;Ben Affleck's input towards the commentary is hysterical!
1754;He absolutely rips everyone in the film.
1755;This movie has more stars than you can count.
1756;The special effects are incredible.
1757;The story has love, action, humor and everything else.
1758;Everyone would enjoy watching this movie.
1759;This film is a must!!!
1760;with AC.3 this film blows your mind, crank up the volume, sit back and enjoy!
1761;a summer blockbuster filled with every action/thiller/sci.
1762;Now, I can appreciate a good action.
1763;adventure flick, but to put this among some of the greatest films ever made is ludicrous.
1764;If you think this is a good movie, even a good action movie, you are an idiot.
1765;Fantastic cast, great storyline, Bruce Willis at his best, a lot of suspense and a lot of fun to watch.
1766;"Contrary to my previous review, ""Armageddon"" has been a personal favorite action movie of mine for some years."
1767;But even I admit that it has as much intelligence as a pop.
1768;the story is set in the present day (Or in Summer 1998.
1769;"Steve Buscemi is particularly likable as ""Rockhound"", a horny geologist (""Do you think we'll hazard pay out of this"")."
1770;So, a subplot between Stamper's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and one of his top drillers A. j (Ben Affleck) is put into place.
1771;No doubt, this is a great special edition set, with two audio commentary tracks, a special director's cut and various documentaries on the movie's making.
1772;But it's satisfying and worth shelling out the dough for.
1773;In one of the best action movies of 1998, Bruce Willis leads the way along with a great, and hilarious, cast.
1774;the movie was very well done, and the action carried throughout.
1775;I realize it's a work of fiction, but come on.
1776;"I liked the ending
1777;And the way that Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck fight almost makes them seem like brothers.
1778;so, if you are a fan of either Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck, you will.
1779;It's a good film"
1780;Although I prefer Deep Impact, because it has more about average people in it, Armageddon is still excellent.
1781;The characters (especially the roughnecks) are fascinating, the dialogue is snappy, and it combines tear.
1782;jerking with triumph in the ending.
1783;fi thriller (with big stars), which actually came after the way better and more emotional Deep Impact.
1784;It's amazing how astronauts, who have been selected because they are the most qualified to venture into space, must train for days, months, years to prepare for a mission.
1785;thar gun sure did look cool.
1786;The writing was, well, I can't call that writing.
1787;Star Trek V was genius compared to this!
1788;It does come in pretty colors and if that suits you, fine!
1789;I love Bruce Willis in this, One of the best actors there is.
1790;I love the story to, A love story in the middle of all this madness.
1791;This movie has some of the best and funniest dialogue.
1792;It you watch the Gag Reel on the Criterion edition you'll see how much fun the actors had making this.
1793;give the movie a chance if you're on the fence about it.
1794;the idea is, watch it, don't think and just go cool special effects .
1795;I mean, how can you take a film seriously which has the line He's got space dementia .
1796;Sort it out and see the funny side of movies like this.
1797;one else mentioned the brilliance of Steve Buscemi in this.
1798;"a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH)1986: ""Aliens (Two."
1799;"disc Collector's Edition)""1998: ""Armageddon""Some might object that I omitted ""Star Wars: Episode IV ."
1800;"My dislike was a combination of the whole ""blockbuster"" syndrome with its fast."
1801;well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super.
1802;editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end.
1803;Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor.
1804;Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non.
1805;stop suspense and action kicked.
1806;speaking of the humor, there are some laugh.
1807;studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).
1808;"top ""blockbuster,"" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it."
1809;Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up.
1810;But such moments are commendably brief, and are easily forgiven in the light of some of the film's delights, as are some of the more commercial, mainstream elements which never quite manage to override the finer qualities of the film.
1811;Visually, it is stunning and original.
1812;The cast are simply fine, and are given a decent script to work with.
1813;The film moves between witty comedic moments and tense drama with no noticeable awkwardness or disjunction.You will enjoy this apocalyptic tale, though after the events of September 11th, its undertones may seem darker and more real than we might otherwise have thought.
1814;There was a great plot though .
1815;Good humor, especially when Bruce Willis tries to shoot Ben Affleck for sleeping with Liv Tyler.
1816;Good acting, good effects, bad science.
1817;Michael Bay truly disappoints with this film.
1818;Honestly guys, stick to what's worth seeing, which isn't this movie.
