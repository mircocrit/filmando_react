1;Color is great , absolutely flawless.
2;Fargo is just DRIPPING with coolness.
3;Just in the first 10 minutes I count nearly a dozen funny, interesting, original moments.
4;This is the kind of movie that holds up under repeat viewings because of the detail, the incredible witty and revealing dialogue, the little moments that you don't fully appreicate the first time around.
5;It will shock you, it will make you laugh out loud.
6;I'm sure it will hold a high place in your video collection.
7;There's plenty of info and deserved praise in the already.
8;It's the most understated of exchanges, practically a monologue, and it is just tight, polished and pitch perfect.
9;It's a turning point in the movie, and two men are trading important info that changes everything, while barely looking at each other, before moving on to talk about the weather.
10;It is funny at times yet still a thriller.
11;I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a non.
12;I will make this short and I will only discuss the merits of the Blu.
13;specific bonus feature is the ability to add some trivia pop.
14;the 'trivia' content splashes on the screen, blocking a good portion of the picture and most of the information provided has little to do with the movie.
15;ray edition to treat this great piece of cinematography with some respect and present it it a way that does not almost scream 'CHEAP'.
16;i will give this Fargo edition 4 stars as an average between the 5.
17;star movie and the 2.
18;ray treatment, rounded up a little.
19;It's definitely a classic, I love the movie and since I started to really flesh out my blue ray collection I was glad to see this was as cheap as it was.
20;I love this movie .
21;it's funny, sad, thought provoking and just really really entertaining!
22;but it was very well done, good story, good performances, and really keeps viewers interest
23;It is a true story and you just wonder how much evil is out there.
24;Oh, and by the way, I am a 17 YEAR OLD TEENAGE GUY who thinks this is the best movie ever made.
25;But it's fun to debate about that kinda stuff.
26;So, if you're under 17 and want to see this movie, be illegal and see it!
27;Worth watching just for the the beautiful photography.
28;William H. Macy is wonderful as the husband desperate to get out from under his father in laws thumb and Steve Bucsemi is great as a bumbling kidnapper and blackmailer.
29;This film is truly amazing!
30;Overall it was really fabulous and I was happy to see familar places I grew up around.
31;It is filled with great performances by its actors, and features an engaging script.
32;A film which can move from hilarity to horror in a matter of minutes.
33;In addition to the wonderful script, it features some of the most inventing sequences seen in a while, most notably putting someone in a wood chipper.
34;Fargo,' is a fun movie to watch, with a great script and performances.
35;A one of a kind movie that's hard to describe.
36;One of the best dark humor movies of all time.
37;The movie is funny and dark and moves along at a very fast pace
38;Overall, I spent most of the movie with my jaw dropped, eyes wide, and stomach roiling at all the gore.
39;After such great reviews of the movie, I was sorely disappointed.
40;The cast is probably one of the best ever chosen.
41;The movie was very enjoyable and keeps your interest throughout.
42;Funny how a state trooper is killed, but no state police to be heard from in any way on this.
43;I love the plot and it was sad it was about real events but the acting was great!
44;There's a reason the Coen Brother's recieved such wide acclaim for this movie.
45;It's among the best movies ever made, although very off.
46;THIS is how you devise a black comedy that involves kidnapping, murder and broken marriages with the spice of real human feeling and sharp wit.
47;The Coen Brothers had really done it, and because of this classic film they will always be on this pedestal that, in my eyes, they havent quite been able to get back up on.
48;"dont get me wrong
49;the film is a really sharply written tale of a desperate mans attempt get his hands on some cash by staging his own wifes kidnapping.
50;It evolves so organically and is one of the only films that is able to balance out so many themes and emotions so eloquently, while still packing a darkly comedic punch.
51;Its funny as can be, but it is also warm in parts (Gundersons relationship with her husband is beautifully fleshed out, despite lack of real screen time) and human in so many others (everything about Macys performance is so desperately perfect that I cant help but laud it as one of the all.
52;i cant recommend this movie enough.
53;Oh wait though, it's a """"comedy"""", so it's ok to make those points in jest."""
54;americans of the area .
55;"I'd love to see some Midwesterners make a damning (but ""funny"") movie about the Coen brothers and their relatives, but real Midwesterners are too good natured and responsible for that."
56;What is it that distinguishes a great film from any other?
57;I want it to reach out of the screen, pick me up from my seat, and take me with it.
58;In short, what I want is a profound emotional experience.
59;Once every blue moon a film comes along that manages to deliver on all of these fronts and for me one such film is the Coen Brothers 'Fargo'.
60;The paths of two painfully ordinary people are brought together by the most extraordinary of crimes.
61;Put on your winter woollie's, throw another log on the fire and sit back and watch extraordinary filmmaking in the form of Fargo.
62;on my 20th viewing of fargo something finally clicked.
63;because (a) it points up the fact that only the audacious wit and humor of the coen brothers could imagine slipping such a thing right under our noses.
64;and (b) in a movie this brilliant, you can make new discoveries (no matter how bizarre) at every turn.
65;One of my favorite Coen Brothers' films.
66;time top 20, though perhaps not in mine.
67;The story is incredible and true.
68;And if you're from Minnesota you'll truly appreciate the accurate cultural description.
69;He is eternally optimistic that it will work out for him.
70;The two big bonuses are the interview with the Cohen brothers and the documentary Minnesota Nice .
71;The extras make this great movie even better.
72;If you have the choice of this version or the El Cheapo, do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks for the special edition, it is truly special.
73;"Just like ""The Big Lebowski"" this movie is the one you can watch over and over again, many."
74;"Early works of Coen brothers like ""Blood Simple"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" were very good, but ""Fargo"" is an absolute pinnacle of their career to my opinion."
75;But it's the Coen's genius that turned it all into a brilliant, smart, ironic and inimitable masterpiece.
76;I've never been to Minnesota but to me the film seems so vivid.
77;It's one of those rare occasions when you forget you're watching actors play.
78;This is one of the Coen brothers' gifts .
79;definately a piece of cinematic art.
80;Besides a very good edition with interesting documentary in bonus features.
81;Truely one the best movies ever.
82;Especially enjoyed the Indian Shep Proudfoot .
83;Such a great classic by the Coen Brothers.
84;Movie is slow sometimes, but becomes an amazing masterpiece by the end.
85;one of my favorite scenes involves a good samaritan out sweeping slush from his sidewalk.
86;"He concludes by saying ""So I heard about them murders in Brainard on the news and I though I'd call this in."
87;What a wonderful display of midwestern sensibility.
88;One of the most original ever made, and well made at that.Yur darn tootin'!
89;Serious subject and somewhat graphic but at the same time very funny in the delivery of the lines.
90;A great film classic that we watch over and over again.
91;But instead it's Marge, hopeful for the future, in a good, secure situation with her almost comically reliable and doting husband, continuing to swell with the infant life she's bearing.
92;if there's room for optimism in this movie, it's there, with Marge delivering Fargo's last lines by talking about how she has two more months before bringing her baby into the world.
93;And, she's done this while preparing to add life to the world.
94;This resourceful woman and the promise she bears within her endures, while the murderers have fallen by the wayside.
95;Hard for a youngster to enjoy now Good to see how actor develops and this is a good movie thanks Coen Brothers
96;This movie is a true story according to the explanation at the beginning of the movie.
97;What I particularly liked to see is that the splash and dash of so many movies ignores the facts that sometimes some things go wrong.
98;This movie portrayed this very realistically.
99;what I really enjoyed about this movie was the real life portrayal of the characters.
100;She investigates the crimes in a straightforward manner and goes on with her life in the movie.
101;what was really neat to hear was the Midwestern accent and the sparse conversation of the people.
102;Kinda funny looking was an acceptable description of a person.
103;the man that pays them to kidnap his wife is wonderfully played by William Macy.
104;this is a must see movie and it especially a good one to see for those would be crooks that are not too bright.
105;The story is bizarre, hilarious, sardonic.
106;I think that it's the Coen Brothers best film.
107;I liked the simplicity of the story and the locales of Minnesotta.
108;margy played a very intelligent officer.
109;I love this movie and have for years.
110;Fargo is off the beaten path.
111;It is unique and has a look and feel and sound all its own.
112;And the stark landscapes are such a big part of the film.
113;to me this story is a tragedy, but it is also often funny and touching.
114;it is one of telling details and revelations.
115;"It is a film that keeps the audience thinking, ""What on Earth is going to happen next?"
116;There is an aspect of our nature, present to some degree in all of us, which takes the measure of life's absurdities and prompts us to respond with studied cynicism.
117;Those who consider it a comfort will find this movie quirky, blackly humorous, and grotesquely original.
118;de force containing fine performances, direction, dialogue and juxtapositions.
119;much has been written about the great performances.
120;The actors all had fun with their parts and it shows.
121;but these are great performances in the service of a nasty film.
122;loads of awards and inspires such breathless laudatory kudos.
123;will you enjoy this film?
124;face style for its own sake, black humour that does not truckle to considerations of taste, and filmmakers brazenly getting away with the stunts they pull, then this film is a cinematic feat.
125;This is a film entirely given over to admiring its own technical prowess.
126;Unique plot, great characters and actors.
127;Have watched it several times, still is enjoyable and holds your attention.
128;Great classic film and story set in north america.
129;Brilliant performances by all actors involved in this classic film ya.
130;It's a good crime film.
131;the violent scenes are pretty realistic.
132;Great movie, although very violent.
133;Have seen several times always enjoyable.
134;Steve, Mary, and WHM really nailed their characters.
135;wise (that is, until we see Steve Buscemi's character sitting at a table in a bar) and then.
136;the movie eventually drifts into a combination of BOTH suspense and comedy segments.
137;steve Buscemi's character (along with his crooked and eerily quiet friend) play the role of two criminals.
138;It's a clever storyline that demands the viewer to watch the film repeatedly in order to understand all the events that take place.
139;Expect a ton of twists and turns.
140;Then, to the surprise of most people, the film turns around and throws a biting style of humor at the viewers.
141;Strange, but completely unique movie.
142;they qualify as comedy because they are actually FUNNY!)
143;especially as this is supposedly one of the funny in.
144;This movie is among the Best 100 American movies of all times (filmsite.
145;office success also came with seven Academy Awards nominations, including Best Supporting Actor (William H. Macy), Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins, The Shawshank Redemption), Best Director (Joel Coen), Best Film Editing (alias Roderick Jaynes, actually the Coens), and Best Picture (Ethan Coen).
146;I'd had preferred a commentary by the Coen brothers, but since photography plays a big role on the movie, it is just fine.
147;"the movie is a really good thriller based on a ""true"" story."
148;The characters of Buscemi and Presnell are just terrific as well, and the only one I did not like is the wife.
149;"This is a gem of a movie named for a city in North Dakota but taking place in Minnesota where people constantly start, end or start and end most sentences with ""Yah."""
150;Her folksy manner conceals a brilliant mind.
151;Her extreme pregnancy and waddling gait conceal irrepressible determination and persistence.
152;comedy something to remember and laugh about.
153;Fargo is by far a HUGE classic in my books.
154;This movie is a realistic one.
155;You may think that is funny, but we also might think that YOUR accent is funny.
156;Anyways, excellent well done movie.
157;Dark story and straight man comedy that will have you disturbed that you are laughing so hard.
158;The humor is outrageous and soo offbeat.
159;The Coen brothers are beyond creative !
160;both a joke and a stylistic choice that effects the entire movie.
161;The subtitle to the movie is A Thriller by Joel and Ethan Coen , and . . . well, it IS a thriller, and it works like one, but it works on so many more levels than that.
162;so . . . the way I watch it, Fargo is a moving meditation on human isolation, on lonliness as a part of the human condition.
163;And pretty much any of the other scenes which involve TV.
164;But, taking after Ulysses, it ends with a bittersweet affirmation of life.
165;This was a very interesting and funny movie.
166;I don't usually care for violent, bloody movies but Fargo handles the story in such a way that I really enjoyed it.
167;The balance between humour and stark, violent content is incredibly well.
168;The Coen Brothers are great story tellers.
169;And they've brought that same genius to the tv show.
170;One of the things that I notice every time I watch a film from the Coen Brothers is how much detail they sink into every single character.
171;The pitch perfect performances of the supporting actors in Blood Simple, how The Dude knew the exact address of a fast food restaurant in The Big Lebowski, and the undeniably cute accents of the characters in Fargo.
172;This movie is endlessly inventive and engaging.
173;Each character is so sharply drawn and written, it's a wonder the Coen Brothers didn't cut their fingers open turning the pages of the screenplay.
174;There are a dozen and a half perfect moments in Fargo, and that's just one of them.
175;Then there's the sweet, light.
176;winning role), who is so undeniably cute, funny, and nice to everyone that you just fall in love with her character.
177;Fargo is such a unique crime caper that it took me two viewings about five years apart to fully understand where the Coen Brothers were taking me with this thriller that doubles as a comedy, but I finally got it.
178;This is the kind of movie that make watching movies such a great experience.
179;i'm obviously not a movie critic, but I lived in the Midwest for a number of years years, covering several states in my job and while most people don't talk like the actors, some do in that part of the country, so I see the humor in it as good natured, getting a chuckle from many of the scenes.
180;There are some brutal scenes as with most Coen brothers movies I've seen and for me they're kinda expected.
181;i enjoyed watching Fargo again (2nd time) not sure if I'll watch again though.
182;I recommend Fargo, especially if you're a Coen Bros. fan.
183;The Coens are not like everybody else in Hollywood and that's good.
184;One of the most fascinating films I've ever seen.
185;I made the right choice.
186;By the way, the actor's are all superb, especially Macy, Oscar.
187;altho funny facuality is left by the way side.
188;The cinematography is incredible, you really start to feel like you're there in Minnesota.
189;Basically, this is masterful filmaking, above all, a story well told.
190;Definitely a must see for anyone interested in making films and for every film buff.
191;its our family tradition to watch it with our older kids.
192;great movie you won't want to miss.
193;This movie is just as good now as when it was released.
194;Worth a second look, and I don't say that often.
195;William H. Macy is a wonderful talent.
196;I loved everything about this movie and watch it again and again.
197;This is easily a movie that will remembered throughout the next century.
198;The entire cast was superb.
199;The movie was able to be funny, but capture the darkness of plot.
200;I absolutely love this movie.
201;I have seen it many times and find new enjoyment in it every time I watch it.
202;I love it's playful dimentia and good humor.
203;The acting is fantastic and realistic.
204;The Coen Bros. strike again with another beautiful.
205;watch movie and a mesmerizing screenplay.
206;This movie is unlike any other movie I've seen, it is just insanely original.
207;This is a one of a kind film that everyone should at least watch once.
208;Once we saw it together, we both laughed as I knew we would.
209;I am from SD previously and it brought back so many memories of the landscape and the dialect!
210;And those accents are just fantastic!
211;I have always loved this movie when I could watch it.
212;prime has to constantly freeze every 5 minutes to catch up with itself.
213;prime a year in advance.
214;In their production of Fargo, they create an atmosphere of incompetence in the northern Midwest, poking fun at the people of Minnesota.
215;William H. Macy also puts in a great performance as car salesman Jerry Lundegaard, whose wife is kidnapped by two men he paid to do it, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, and then his wealthy father.
216;I'm possibly the biggest Steve Buscemi fan, and he's great in this one.
217;That probably would have added some more humor to his role, even though it is hilarious already.
218;His interaction with the parking booth attendant his great.
219;This movie also recieved the Best Screenplay Oscar, which was well.
220;"ray of ""Fargo"", one of my favorite recent flicks, I cannot accept the idea that the original film has these artifacts."
221;ups of William Macy suggest that he has a serious skin condition.
222;"As a movie, of course, ""Fargo"" is simply wonderful."
223;I've always enjoyed watching it and I guess will have to continue to do so.
224;Fargo is not about North Dakota, but it is one of the most enjoyable movies we have ever watched.
225;The acting is superb all the way around, and the screenplay dialog is very well written.
226;It was a gift for a friend and my bro and her watched it, they liked it.
227;Of course the direction, production, acting and dialogue was great .
228;but what makes this my favorite movie of the 1990's (and in some ways I think the most important) was its commentary on the dignity of the human person.
229;It's appraisal of the values of life, sexuality, honesty, and relationships are beautifully (any at times graphically) illustrated in this fine piece of cinema.
230;Great movie, very dark humor!
231;We're enjoying the new series of Fargo so much we wanted to watch the original as a basis, to see the similarities.
232;The new Fargo made me appreciate the old one more now than I did a few years ago.
233;"This movie opens with the words ""This is a true story."
234;She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.
235;But it's still a great movie.
236;William H. Macy does a superb job.
237;Another masterpiece by the always surprising and enjoyableCohen Brothers productions.
238;this story was great, humor, mystery, lots of suspense.
239;Coen brothers break out commercial success.
240;the one was right before their best work The Big Lebowski.
241;It is a rare occurance to find a piece of popular entertainment that rises to the level of high art and genius.
242;Yet the film Fargo, by the Cohen Brothers, certainly is a classic superb work of art.
243;the film is a wonderful essay on the nature of evil, the levels of evil, and the lack of control human beings actually have of Evil once it is let loose upon us.
244;macy's acting is superb as he portrays the nervous insipid frantic actions of a man of mundane evil who through his stupidity lets loose great evil.
245;to sort out this crazy plot and put the forces of evil back into the box is certainly one of the strongest heroines in all literature and cinema.
246;Yet Elizabeth Bennett adheres to her internal values and judgement and triumphs in a world dominated by men.
247;She trusts her internal strenghts, judgement, sense of justice,and knowledge of human frailty and with these tools she confronts a killing machine of demonic proportions.
248;"with dark humor combined with human tragedy, this film eventually allows persistent and intelligent innocence to triumph over random and stupid evil
249;Fargo is among the better efforts of the Coen Brothers.
250;It was well deserved, as she not only mastered the Midwest accent but created a complex character that was almost naive, always seeing the good in people and situations"
251;William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi were also great in this movie.
252;They captured the flaws and weakness in their respective characters well.
253;The whole darn cast was excellent, and everything worked.
254;You might be laughing at the quirky Midwest characters and their funny accents, but then you have to admire the son.
255;'Fargo' might just seem like a lot of quirks and foibles but actually there is a lot of keen observation of human behavior, and after a while all those quirks and foibles add up to very memorable characters whose stories are told in quite compelling narratives.
256;one trademark of Joel Coen is that he often pays homage to the great film director Stanley Kubrick, and 'Fargo' has a couple of examples that I will leave to the viewer to discover on his or her own.
257;The oddness of each character, the situations they find themselves in, it is dark comedy at its best.
258;The acting is entertaining and engaging.
259;It kept my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.
260;The plot is deceptively simple.
261;Yet the directing and acting make it gripping.
262;One was given to the Coen brothers for best original screenplay.
263;Yeh, this is one of the best darn movies ever made.
264;Interesting to review again before the TV series starts.
265;I recommend watching it if you have never seen it or watching it again even if you have.
266;Didnt see why ppl rated it so well.
267;The story is engaging although the language, violence, and gross sexuality are distrubing.
268;vi would definitely recommend this movie to others for purchasing this
269;This movie gives new meaning to the term dark humor .
270;The fact that one can actually laugh in the middle of such a disturbing movie speaks volumes for the talent of the Coen brothers.
271;It is definitely worth your time
272;Movie was good and kept me on the edge.
273;I liked the acting and would suggest this movie to others.
274;this is an awesome film that you can't never forget!
275;william macy's doing great, also carter burwell's music is excellant!
276;Some of the best acting I've seen in a long time.
277;Very dramatic, not cliche at all.
278;"This was one of the funniest, cleverest movies I have ever seen
279;I think there are some requirements for appreciating this movie: you must enjoy irony, sarcasm and black humor"
280;The Coen brothers really hit the spot with Fargo, starting out as a kidnapping mystery and ending up as a comedy!!!!
281;and from there the story really escalates!I wont reveal any more of the plot here it is something that have to be enjoyed in front of the screen, but I will say that this seems to be one of those movies where everything works perfect and all the pieces fit, to create a fantastic puzzle in the end.
282;This quirky dark comedy had us interested the whole time.
283;Fargo is an absolutely brilliant movie that everyone shouldown.
284;It's worth a look for anyone who hasn't seen it.
285;Everyone is outstanding and this film should have won Best Picture in 1996.
286;william H. Macy is excellent in his role of a husband who arranged a fake kidnapping, which goes sour.
287;And Steve Buscemi is great as a somewhat bumbling kidnapper.
288;beautifully written and directed by Joel and Ethan Cohen, FARGO, in certain scenes, might make you very uncomfortable and soon afterwards you might find yourself laughing at a comedic scene.
289;They execute this with great skill.
290;Love the story line howeever!
291;"Interesting storyline and great acting set in chilly, icy North Dakota
292;I put Fargo up there with the best.
293;The Coens are young and productive, so it will be interesting to see what they come up with in their careers.
294;Buscemi's reaction to Stormare shooting the cop is funny in a twisted way.
295;This one scene sets the tone of the whole movie.
296;buscemi's reaction to Presnell's refusal to deal is funny.
297;but Buscemi's reaction to being shot is also funny, and is also scary.
298;This brief moment really establishes her character.
299;marge Gunderson's relationship with her husband is really endearing, and is a thread that runs throughout the movie.
300;It gives the movie a lot more humanity that most Coen films have.
301;and Bill Macy"
302;Saw this movie years ago and forgot how good it was.
303;Between the laughter and the gasps, it's nonstop entertainment.
304;In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it.
305;this is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie.
306;"turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a pure ""black comedy."
307;"Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."""
308;"Macy is hilarious
309;Her character in here, """"Marge Gunderson,"""" elevates this movie from just another modern."""
310;day crime movie, to an original.
311;"bizarre music (slow violins) and solid cinematography, and you have an ""original,"" the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors."
312;they did this one right.
313;It's one of the Coen's best films itself, and personally I am from Minnesota and love it.
314;Sure, some of those accents are more or less very Northern sounding and a little off at times, but it's all in good fun.
315;I am now glued to the TV on Tuesday nights!
316;Would recommend this movie if you like the suspense.
317;After watching it again I realized that this is a brilliantly written and directed movie.
318;I live in the northern part of the United States and Coen's portrayal of the lifestyle is very accurate(including the accents!)
319;Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy.
320;All I can say is: that is 98 minutes of my life that I will NEVER get back.
321;i thought this movie was pretty darn good.
322;loved the quiet strength of the women cop, crazy I can't remember her name.
323;It surprises me how many today remember the funny moments in this film and forget that it's really a dark production about awful human beings to whom loyalty is unknown, doing things most decent human beings would regard as unconscionable.
324;Fargo falls somewhere between four and five stars, but I'll round up because I admire its originality.
325;I don't know if that bit of trivia is commonly known but I thought I'd mention it.
326;I watched this good movie, here in Brazil.
327;Some of the films more disturbing scenes are the funniest and that's what makes this film so great.
328;The whole scene where the thugs kidnap Jean is worth the price of the film right there.
329;With oscar worthy performances and a script tighter than most.
330;this is a film that stands out as perfect.
331;Loved every minute of it.
332;I don't watch many films twice but this was one of the ones i was happy to.
333;I've also lent it to my family and they have also enjoyed it as much as i did.
334;the characters are funny and despite the serious nature of the subject tackled, that it's not all about money, the film does raise many laughs and is light in places.
335;Fargo was somewhat a long movie but it was really funny and really followed through with a big hit.
336;I beilve this was Coen brothers first film.
337;William H. Macy and Buscesmi preform great in this film.
338;But great movie with a great plot.
339;FARGO is a modern classic of cinema.
340;One of the things that I enjoy most about the Coen brothers' movies is that they both understand their art form: movies are primarily visual works of art.
341;While the plot of FARGO is, in many ways, simple and somewhat predictable, the cinematography is amazing.
342;The blanket white landscapes that the Coen brothers paint gives the film the elegance of a black and white film with the beauty of a work in color.
343;fARGO introduces us to another one of William H. Macy's masterful performances.
344;He plays the perfect Everyman, someone who is absolutely despicable and, yet, manages to win our sympathy.
345;It is perfect because we see a glimmer of something in his sad existence that reminds us of our own.
346;In a surprising act of agency, he hatches a scheme to accomplish two goals: to gouge his father.
347;Funny moments, but not really my kind of humor.
348;This film had a great story, geat photography and great acting that almost changes the improbable into reality.
349;I prefer to think of it as good drama which contains some black comedy.
350;ray version is a noticable improvement over the original because the story is so engrossing and the original photography was so good, you don't really notice any significant incremental contribution made by Blu.
351;Great film, but certainly not for kids or those with an aversion to some graphic violence.
352;The great plot and story by the Coen brothers.
353;The movie is one of the best of all time with a star studded cast.
354;"I was a fan of the Coen Brothers early work,""Blood Simple"",""Raising Arizona"",""Millers Crossing""."
355;I thought they had a great sense of visual and verbal style.
356;introduced them to great film.
357;They were writing great dialogue again as well as great characters.
358;"He should have gotten an Oscar nomination for ""Ghost World"") as one of the kidnappers."
359;She's a good police officer with a good heart, and one of the pleasures of this excellent film is watching the contrast between her routine, ordinary life and the pathetic, scrambling desperation of the vicious criminals of this story.
360;Fine work from the Coen brothers and the entire cast.
361;Another engaging, often hilarious film by the Coen brothers.
362;midwest accent is comically played up in a very human and tongue.
363;William H. Macy is absolutely wonderful as the film's eye of the storm, and his character is a perfect blend of simplicity and evil.
364;She finds the right blend of humour and toughness, and her performance is very warm and completely convincing.
365;Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make a very memorable pair of slimy cretinous criminals.
366;But this is a Coen brothers film, with a body count worthy of a Shakespeare tragedy, so perhaps my objection is a little misplaced.
367;disk set from a great Amazon seller: Standing Ovation.
368;"the very first special feature on the ""Fargo"" Blu."
369;this movie shows great snow scenes almost never seen in the movies.
370;out road conditions are presented, and the photography is breathtaking.
371;Fargo (1996) is a happy exception.
372;the opening and closing shots (well, almost the closing shot.
373;Seldom have I seen a movie that so captured my attention and imagination.
374;Such a simple story to tell and who would have ever thought such a simple beginning would unfold into such a complex yet fully and completely hysterical, sick and twisted humor?It is amazing to me to see so much talent on display both on the screen and behind it.
375;It makes going to the Movies the most special of all entertainments.
376;I really enjoyed Fargo the first time I saw it but by the end of the interruptus, I could see why so many applaud the Coen Brothers' genius.
377;One reviewer called the script juvenile which is quite funny since Joel Coen won an Academy Award for best screenplay with Fargo.
378;This is another one of the Coen Brother's practical jokes.)
379;It's a great movie to watch following and afternoon of Thanksgiving food.
380;I would recommend it become a Holiday tradition.
381;i know it sounds mean, but I laugh at the scene of the wifescreaming and running around, both in the house and at the cabin in the snow.
382;Other scenes are really funny too: the girls describing the one guy as funny lookin, the two guys discussing weather and other events in the driveway
383;Leave it to the genius minds of Joel and Ethan Coen to write a movie that is at the same time horrific and hilarious.
384;the plotline and charcters could have made this movie go either way, but the smart Coens decided to make it a comedy thriller.
385;the result: best picture nomination and a great motion picture.
386;Anything by the Coen brothers is great.
387;No other movie uses dialog in such an effective, engaging way.
388;The Coen Brothers truly have a gift in producing settings that feel real and in spinning a twisted tale.
389;Her persistence carries the story through.
390;Well, you'll just have to watch and see.
391;We realy enjoyed this movie, yet it's certainly not the movie for everyone.
392;I believe that a black comedy appeals to a fraction of the general public.
393;It was just as good as I remembered and I loved the extra features, which spoke about the making of the movie and showing a little bit of what is like to actually live in Fargo.
394;This is an intelligent, wacky movie with great performances from everyone in the cast.
395;Fargo is a totally original thriller with sharp turns and pop.
396;The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them.
397;She loves her husband and he loves her.
398;She's the police chief, affecting a self.
399;Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife.
400;All in all it's a carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed.
401;or is it the other way around?Another excellent Coen and Coen film is the less well.
402;is in some ways still their best.
403;This film just strikes every chord I like about movie watching.
404;Great movie that inspired a great TV show of the same name.
405;This is one of the all time great movies.
406;It has many twists and turns.
407;and is interesting and exciting till the very end.
408;The story is so blizzard that it makes you question that it's a true story.
409;Funny, horrific, dramatic and very entertaining!
410;This type of heroine, that the movie wisely shows, forsakes away all of Hollywood's clich s for this type of character.
411;life criminals for kidnapping his own wife.
412;There are several scenes that are memorable such as the guy being shot in the face (just kinda funny), wood chopper scene, and the discussion with the guy shoveling the snow outside.
413;these words describe the coen brothers somewhat true story of Fargo.
414;I wont give to much away but this move is interesting and bizzare.
415;I had to watch the movie twice before I could get the whole jist of it and once I did, I simply loved it.
416;"I laughed sevearal times at the accents used by all the actors: ""Oh yaaah?"
417;I recommend this fun film for a good Friday night laugh flick!
418;This is one of the best black comedy movies I have ever seen in my life!
419;Check out Blood Simple and Barton Fink, great movies by the Cohens!
420;I could watch this movie over and over!
421;The plot, screenwriting, acting are very well done.
422;"It is no wonder this movie got an Academy Award
423;Perfect cast for a great movie!
424;FILM of this age has grain in it.
425;ray should give you the experience of watching FILM.
426;Gotta admire those salty Midwesterners.
427;cheek tribute to Midwestern grit that makes the Coen Brothers' FARGO such a delight.
428;This is a fun ride, no matter how bleak the story becomes, don't ya know.
429;the outstanding cast features two standouts who really make this movie glide like a curling iron on the ice (gotta use that Northern metaphor, ya see).
430;Both actors are topnotch as happy.
431;lucky Minnesotans who maintain their demeanor no matter what the external circumstances, which become considerable.
432;which accounts for the unmistakable charm of this film.
433;(And its humor, which often has to be taken simultaneously with serious shock value.)
434;Funny, outrageous, dark, quirky, often downright sad, FARGO has become a timeless portrayal of Midwestern nuance at its nonsensical best.
435;Which makes this entertaining movie the hoot that it is, eh?
436;I've seen this movie several times and what makes it so interesting is the fact that it is true.
437;Good actors make the story very enjoyable!
438;And still do even after watching it 10 times.
439;i spoke to a baseball player who practiced and played in Fargo.
440;He said the city is a wonderful place.
441;Even the movie showed Fargo is a wonderfully unique place to live.
442;Fargo is a wonderful piece of modern crime film making.
443;The script is clever, suspenseful, violent and very, very funny.
444;It's greater success hinges on the cast and the wonderful performances.
445;While she actually has les screen time than some of the others, she creates a character that will forever be remembered in American cinema.
446;out, comically twitching raw nerve.
447;Buscemi and Stormare are the perfect dopey villains and Presnell as Macy's father.
448;beautifully filmed and acted, it is a true gift to the audience from the Coen brothers and deserved all its acclaim and more.
449;This is one awesome movie.
450;The story is great and it moves right along.
451;She did a great job with the Minnesota accent.
452;I just love this movie.
453;Its stars are both funny and serious, especially William H Macy.
454;Sure was in a pickle with his finances and the funny kidnapping.
455;Love the police chief, I know why she got the award for her part in the movie.
456;One of the best movies ever.
457;Decency prevails in the work of a small town sheriff.
458;One of my all time favorites .
459;Marge the cop just makes it for me!
460;winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U. s. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor.
461;Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling"
462;earth yet slick, her luminous blue.
463;cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here .
464;while I would not rate this up with Raising Arizona, this certainly does rank among the best films the Coens have made to date.
465;If you're a Coen fan, this is a must.
466;time favorite movies and is, in my estimation, the Coen brothers' best endeavor.
467;Its gripping plot, the excellent performances by the actors, and its consistently quick.
468;moving action all contribute to this assessment.
469;town Minnesota police officer, who, although pregnant, doggedly stays with the case until she solves it.
470;This is almost certainly her best performance.)
471;in every way this is a worthwhile movie.
472;We love this movie so much when we adopted our rescue dog, named him Fargo.
473;The writing is snappy and the acting is terrific.
474;I liked where they based the whole movie.
475;How they played through each screen, murderous fun.
476;Very good, even after all these years recommended viewing over the holiday season.
477;titled, since the region as a whole, up.
478;Dense, rich and pointed, with an impressive appreciation for small details, this is a loaded hundred.
479;minute ride that's most definitely in the argument for the Coens' best.
480;I myself love their unique style and pacing, starting with Blood Simple back in 1984.
481;This movie from 1996 brought them into the spotlight with many oscar nominations.
482;the picture is super nice.
483;This movie has very nice, high level of natural grain.
484;It looks very clean and sharp, while maintaining a nice cinema look.
485;The thing that stands out most on this title is the great detail in the outdoor landscapes.
486;The snowy landscape looks so vivid and sharp.
487;Much like No Country For Old Men, it is a great looking movie.
488;The night time scenes look nice and sharp also.
489;The blacks are deep and stable.
490;This movie has so much vivid color to it.
491;The closeups have great intracate detail.
492;The skintones are right on the money as well.
493;The picture does have that 3 dimentional pop that makes the title worth owning.
494;the audio track on this movie is great.
495;While there are not many action scenes or shootouts, this movie does have a very good soundtrack.
496;The voices are nice and clean without any distractions.
497;The most important part is that it made the best from what it has to offer.
498;Commentaries, trivia, trailer, Tv spots, making of featurette also.
499;Well worth the $19.99 if you liked this movie.
500;MGM did a great job on this one.
501;This is an excellent film.
502;It is certainly closer to a black comedy than mystery.
503;William Macy dos a fine job as the husband.
504;Steve Buscerni was superb as one of the kidnappers.
505;She's an ordinary person who does her job well and benefits from it.
506;But y'see I already saw it.
507;Some of them are pretty funny but I don't remember what they were sellin'.
508;This film is stunningly beautiful in every way, from the score and storyline to the actors and the action.
509;William H. Macy turned out the best performance of his career in this movie (just in front of Boogie Nights.)
510;He's caught and he knows it and plays the blundering, studdering fool perfectly.
511;I like the older version of this movie and I received it.
512;It is funny, action, plot good.
513;It was shipped right away and received in good condition.
514;It was all around good acting and the story is so scary I had to watch it with the lights on.
515;Like most of the Coens' movies I had to see this multiple times to appreciate it.
516;"The first time I saw it I was swayed by the advance hype and I thought it was just okay
517;The laconic blond kidnapper is funnier every time I see the movie, and Steve Buscemi's vigorous and vicious performance is also worth watching.
518;William H. Macy's hilarious turn as a squirelly, snivelling, slimy used car dealer catapaulted his career.
519;It's interesting to contrast this movie with Seven , which I loved, and in which the killings didn't bother me as much because there was a purpose behind them, however twisted.
520;in the final analysis this is still a well.
521;very humorous in spots even aside from the silly accents, and nicely chilling in both the setting and the treatment of a seemingly simple kidnapping/extortion attempt gone awry.
522;one of the few exceptions is """"Fargo,"""" the Coen Brothers' breakout movie."""
523;This movie could have had no plot at all, and it would still have been fun.
524;Fargo is the perfect example of a quirky movie done right, mainly because.
525;"mostly the ""Minnesota nice"" (even the cops are pleasant and chipper!)"
526;"back attitude and the eccentric sense of humor (""Ah, hon, ya got Arby's all over me!"")"
527;but the murder scheme itself is fairly entertaining, simply because it becomes more chaotic with every step.
528;On the other hand, the investigation is handled in an oddly laid.
529;back way, so that the audience just sort of sits back and enjoys the journey with Marg.
530;And wound around the main plot are a series of small, oddly memorable personal subplots (Marge's husband entering an important art competition).
531;"despite lots of blood and murder, ""Fargo"" is a quirky, charming little movie ."
532;and it lets you know pretty much how the Coens see Minnesota.
533;But acceptable performance of the most veterans actors
534;"This movie was brilliantly entertaining, without the ""boom boom"" of most entertaining movies."
535;I remember how much I loved this movie, because of the blood and humor.
536;Now, with my interest in movies becoming deeper, I see that this movie worked perfectly for one particular reason.
537;In so doing this, they combine their unique humor with a ruthless crime drama.
538;The thing that ties these two points so beautifully together is the nonchalance.
539;feel of the whole movie.
540;The actors, the scenes, the simpleness of the actors, the simpleness of the scenes.
541;Enough said, see this film!A last point, for language lovers.
542;There is a great American English dialect spoken in this movie, which is a Minnesotan dialect.
543;This is a good movie, brings thriller and comedy together with special taste of the coen brothers.
544;i've never seen it before and I bought it because coen brothers make good movies.
545;it's worth the price, try it.You won't regret.
546;Not for the faint of heart nor easily upset by violence and gore, but this movie presents a stunning contrast between good and evil.
547;I liked this movie for its base story.
548;The reason is thatthey take some of the actions and comments personal.
549;From the Coen brothers, who were behind the other great films Barton Fink and Blood Simple comes Fargo.
550;serious and hilariously funny film based on a true story that happened in Minnesota in the 80's.
551;Like Pulp Fiction the dialogue is brilliant and essential to the success of the film.
552;It's very original and one of the best in recent years along with Pulp Fiction , L. a. Confidential , American Beauty and Traffic .
553;Not a movie I will watch weekly, but good enough to watch again, someday.
554;This is another one of those movies that you will either love or hate.
555;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
556;A movie is fiction and the directors can do whatever they please.
557;Yes, you did hear me right.
558;The wife is kidnapped and several people are killed, making some REALLY sticky and often funny situations.
559;One of my favorite parts is when the guy is trying to hide his money.
560;The music is very fitting for this movie.
561;The acting and the actors are excellent.
562;The story has its ironies and its characters, indeed!
563;Funny movie with great actors!
564;Every time you watch it, you catch something new.
565;So which is the true story that they both claim to be?
566;True story + excellent actors + dark comedy + well.
567;written script = awesome entertainment experience.
568;This movie has been a favorite of mine for many years.
569;Even more entertaining because its true.
570;Very dark and very funny.
571;Fargo is worth watching if you like film.
572;But if you liked Bernie give Fargo a watch.
573;As the subject says, this was a great film and while I am sad to see nothing new was done to it, am glad we got something
574;grindingly suspenseful, cleverly literate, and an affectionate and perceptive take on flyover America.
575;midwestern language and behavior is so powerful that the term Fargo accent has entered our vocabulary, along with the shortest movie catchphrase on record: Yah.
576;But is there a more grimly funny film in the 1990s?
577;It was a basic and simple film, but the acting, the characters, the location it was so simple, so perfect, so unexpected.
578;An insanely good film, like most Coen Brothers films.
579;a good movie I seen it many years ago and forgot how slow it is but I still think it was a ok show
580;I remember Ebert raving about the unusual dialogue of the movie.
581;I was pretty happy with the film.
582;Although I was busy while watching it I was drawn to it and what I took from it was enjoyable.
583;homicide investigation movie, the Coen brothers have turned it into a dark comedic masterpiece by setting it in the Midwest.
584;There, the strangely simple sensibility (and the accents) make for one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
585;it's a film about people, and funny people at that!
586;Having that said, the film was an extraordinary look into the atrocity to which humans can resort.
587;The acting made the experience worthwhile.
588;This is a good movie.
589;Then you find out it's a true story!
590;This is a genuine rarity, a truly perfect film.
591;Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great and truly frightining as the hitmen.
592;Everyone all around is outstanding, even the supporting players.
593;This is the Coen brothers best film, their sense of human behavior and interaction, along with their dialog, is spot.
594;Not only one of the best films of the 90's, one of the best films ever made!
595;It's really quite brilliant in putting all the idiosyncracies of that area of the country on film with only a little bit of exaggeration (yes, some Minnesotans do talk like that).
596;see the movie for the brilliant writing and acting.
597;Macy's portrayal of a man imploding is wonderful.
598;This is one of those movies that I enjoy viewing periodically.
599;The Black levels are amazing, the details as well.
600;ray realease, but it sounds very good.
601;"The other Coen Brothers film that I saw before this was ""Raising Arizona"" which I still think is among the best comedies that I've ever seen."
602;"I still prefer ""Raising Arizona"" just a little more than ""Fargo"" but this is still an excellent film and just like the former will reward repeat viewing."
603;wise and the special feature documentaries are also a big plus.
604;Fans of the Coen Brothers' quirky sense of humour and hence unique film.
605;"making style will not be disappointed here and for me both ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona"" are their best films to date."
606;Liked the acting and the fact it was a true story.
607;I was a tad bothered at a few moments, but the overall movie was enjoyable.
608;I felt the movie had a moderate reply value.
609;I liked it whenever I wanted something easy.
610;The Coen Brothers have given us a real jewell.
611;Like we all learned some important moral lesson.
612;makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie.
613;anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix unique dark humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny .
614;Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more.
615;It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens.
616;the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.
617;The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them.
618;The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood.
619;Macy is amazing and a spot.
620;on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking.
621;He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific.
622;Any way I look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass because it is perfect.
623;I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
624;Fargo is now one of my favorite films.
625;I decided to watch the great movie again since I started watch the new series on tv.
626;movie is the best ever
627;The main female actor is wonderful.
628;Winter pictures and plot is very interesting.
629;Every time you watch this movie it is catching.
630;I loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone.
631;The story (true), photography, and acting are superb.
632;Interesting story with great actor and actress.
633;I would definitely recommend this to all adults.
634;I found it great from the begining but the characters got a bit on my nerves, still, after catching it on TV over a dozen times you can't help but have them grow on you, specially the inquisitive (and pregnant!)
635;for such a tragic story, this is one of the funniest films you'll ever see, specially considering a boy ends up with his mother/grandfather killed and his father in jail and his inheritance lost in the middle of nowhere.
636;"But with ""Fargo,"" the Coens somehow managed to take their unique mix of madcap and malevolence to a new level, and created a truly epic film that's only about 100 minutes long and has no real point."
637;But this film is also a genuine example of how a thing can be more than the sum of its parts.
638;For, with all of the advantages it has going for it, the least of which is an acute sense of humor, it's still rather difficult to pick out just why this film is so great.
639;It's the way it all comes together, the connections, the unspeakable, that makes you rewind happy.
640;driven and complex, yet its efficiency makes it move so well.
641;Even so, there is still time to enjoy the many marvelous shots provided by cinematographer Roger Deakins (oscar nommed for this film) which border on trompe l'oeil at times.
642;Even so, she makes the most of her screentime, and brings together this piece of noir/comedy/satire/morality play.
643;steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are Coen film regulars, and are never given enough credit for their work in this film.
644;As the bad guys, they are brilliant!
645;Coen regular Harve Presnell also is great as the father.
646;"A fine assemblage of people came together to make this odd story great
647;many kudos to Joel and Ethan Coen for their winning screenplay based on the story told to them by their grandmother.
648;This movie gives me the shivers.
649;hearted characters and the despicable things they do, or maybe because I know I am watching one of the best, most original films I have ever seen, containing especially unique dialogue, perfect performances, and an effectively chilling score.
650;this true story is true in the Aristotelian sense: there is a heart of what must or should occur involved in the submerged politeness and simmering, stifled needs of the Minnesota Nice.
651;By that I mean the get into the role and do a very fine and interesting job in their roles.
652;The story is true so you are brought into to craziness of the crooks and the steadfastness of the good guys of that great northern state.
653;We enjoyed the movie and in particular the individual actors and their capabilities to bring these actors to life.
654;This is an excellent and intriguing motion picture realistically acted by Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy and Harve Presnell.
655;Offbeat it is well scripted and directed with great visual style.
656;Buscemi gives a standout performance as he usually seems to.
657;It contains another innovative score composed by Carter Burwell.
658;Underrated Burwell just keeps coming up with one great score after another.
659;His score attributes to much of the success of this film as it is very stylistic while subconsciously leads the viewer to one unexpected image after another.
660;This is good filmmaking and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
661;Love the accents and the craziness of the plot.
662;The actors do a great job of staying in character as well.
663;Would recommend for a fun movie to watch.
664;It is still a great movie but, the original was better.
665;If you're looking for a movie that combines excellent acting, a first.
666;rate story, and a hilarious satire of the upper.
667;But, it had heart, humor, and little known cast members (i. e.,Macy and Buscemi) with a future.
668;It is now recognized as one of the most important movies of its time.
669;After all these years, Fargo still surprises and satisfies!
670;Both the wife and I loved it!
671;This movie has to be one of the top hundred greatest movies of all time.
672;It was made by the C brothers, which means it's naturally going to appeal to us artistic, intellectual, weirdo, cool/strange types, right?
673;The Coen brothers oeuvre is filled with little masterpieces, but this is their best.
674;A great movie for 16 and above.
675;Funny in many places but also tragic.
676;an insight in to a woman's mind.
677;Today I decided to watch a movie that was getting rave reviews and won oscars six years ago.
678;If you enjoyed the movie A Simple Plan , you will enjoy this but if you hated A Simple Plan don't bother to see this one.
679;This one has it all .
680;worthy of the awards it received.
681;and pretty screwed up, but the way they get rid of the body is actually so shocking that it made me laugh.
682;There is magic in this film.
683;The setting of the film is magical.
684;IMO, this film is a masterwork.
685;And at the same time, undeniably, a masterpiece!
686;Everything about the movie was inventive .
687;All the performances are outstanding.
688;It is my favorite movie of all time.
689;If you haven't seen it, you must!
690;After watching it, I saw that it was one of my favorite movies.
691;She trully was excellent in the movie but I loved William H Macy in the movie.
692;It is inspired by a true story in which a car salesman, played by William H. Macy, who has his wife kidnapped so that his rich father in law will give a ransom which will go to him.
693;The story goes from being hilarious to absolutely tragic.
694;what makes this movie the best though is the accents.
695;This makes it in itself hilarious.
696;it is a great story and I reccomend it to everyone but especially someone wanting to watch both a comedy and a drama at the same time.
697;I've watched this movie a few times over the years because it is worth watching a few times over the years.
698;Fargo is a remarkable film Noir spiced with this touch of genius of the Coen brothers, whose acidic gaze about the nasty behavior of the human being blends the cynical style of the black British humor, admirably built for marvelous vignettes and slow paced script that will keep you amazed from start to finish.
699;frances Mac Dormand won a more than deserved Academy Award with this towering acting.
700;one of these jeweled gems of the Coen brothers, that you and me are use to appreciate from their creative muse.
701;I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the acting.
702;The moral or the story is actually somewhat redeeming.
703;All the time the cool headed police eventually get their man.
704;They mock the accents of Minnesota in a funny way.
705;This movie is still very dark but very well written.
706;How they are able to bring humor into this crazy scenario is the magic of this movie
707;suspense on a low level, with a tiny bit of American slapstick humor at times .
708;wanna understand this great movie?
709;William Macy is brilliant as the wimpish, husband who bribes two men to kidnap his wife, so his father.
710;they rarely seem to make a dull film and have made plenty of thought provoking,funny,violent films.
711;the best part of this film though are the characters and the dialogue which is both witty,pitiful and yet certain characters show a cuteness which belies the fact that they may be seen intially as 'simple' folk.
712;lucky country cop,yet underneath this veneer is a sharpness and ruthlessness that when tested is well able to bite.
713;the way she deals with the evasive William H Macy and her old school colleague is amazing.
714;she's always polite yet she lets people know exactly what she wants and she usually gets it.
715;she also displays a deep down warmth even when she's a witness to appalling scenes of brutality.
716;her speech at the end of the movie is truly memorable.
717;it's rare that her words of such simplicity can have such a startling effect on the viewer.
718;william H Macy is also excellent in his role as the loser husband who nobody really pays much attention to and who is the catalyst for the unravelling nightmare of events.
719;steve Buscemi is excellent,as usual,as the kidnapper with the funny lookin' appearance .
720;this movie has so many simple comic moments,so many hilarious cameo scenes from the various characters who are questioned by the police.
721;I loved this movie when it first came out, and so am very pleased to have this edition for home viewing.
722;If you missed Fargo the first time around, give it a look.
723;And, if you are already a fan, you can share it with your family and friends.
724;The """"Remastered"""" version of Fargo is actually NOT the """"4K"""" version."""
725;This movie was recommended to me as a classic.
726;It is amazing that movies like Fargo get a pass from critics in the name of artistic license and creativity.
727;If using the word vomit turns out to be grounds for pulling my rating then it should also be grounds for pulling the moving from circulation.
728;This is a great movie with a great message, if you are not faint of heart.
729;All the performances are first rate, right down to the unsympathetic, unlikely villain of the story's (Jerry.
730;Small part for Harve Presnell, but powerful impact.
731;An absorbing and memorable movie.
732;Great movie awesome plot good actors enjoy the movie a lot I would refer this movie a must watch indeed.
733;I love this movie, and I'm not even a Coen fan.
734;western accent, which is hilarious.
735;All in all, a pretty enjoyable movie.
736;Good plot, well chosen cast and funny, funny, funny!
737;I gave Fargo three stars because I enjoyed most of it.
738;It was funny, and witty.
739;Its R rating reflects strong violence, pervasive strong language and some sexual situations.
740;The first 96 minutes were great.
741;The last 2 took away from it!
742;This is a very interesting and entertaining film, and all the more because it is based on a true story.
743;He wants it from his father in law who will naturally refuse to give it.
744;The best Jewish thriller ever produced.
745;The Coen Brothers are perfect witnesses for these flunkies drop.
746;A classic of sorts of the Jewish humor we like.
747;I thought it was going to be something like O Brother.
748;I love this movie, and watch on a somewhat regular basis.
749;The story part was good.
750;It's very funny in a dark kind of way, especially the deadpan comments of the two crooks and the perfect timing of the direction.
751;town sheriff is graphically shot in the head.
752;The movie just gets more interesting at that point, especially when we are introduced to our hero.
753;It's neat how this film shows us a thriller played out by simple small.
754;William H. Macy does an excellent job portraying a man who is frustrated and can't seem to get a break.
755;The film reminds us all of a time in which we had a good thing planned out and going good for ourselves, only to watch someone else ruin it for us.
756;earth, credible, engaging characters, and of course the concrete, dazzling performances turned it by the entire cast.
757;Good story and good acting.
758;I liked the North Dakota dialect.
759;Ya.You betcha' is a hoot.
760;If you are reasonably intelligent, have a sense of humor and are film.
761;reviews and see it for yourself.
762;This is a modern classic, filled with dark humor, an intriguing plot and wonderful performances.
763;Good to catch up with this movie, it streamed perfectly and was very easy to download, would definitely recommend this!
764;The scene in the restaurant with the high school friend was brilliant and hilarious.
765;William Macy was perfectly cast and I kept talking to my TV and telling him what an idiot he was.
766;No crap, no nonsense and grounded.
767;This Coen brothers film is so hilarious (and dark) that it really has to be savored frame by frame with no disturbance.
768;What great twists and turns!
769;The plot easily sucks you in and the characters are very unique.
770;I love how the ending of the real Fargo leads the viewer to the new TV version of Fargo.
771;"Wow, when I saw this movie last year I couldn't believe how good it was
772;When I finally found an opportunity to watch it, I was expecting a lot.
773;On the other hand, William H. Macy deserved the Oscar that year, even over Cuba Gooding Jr.
774;Good movie with a great cast.
775;I liked that the writers didn't dwell on it being cold or snowy since that weather is the norm.
776;My wife had not seen this movie so we watched it together she enjoyed it as well.
777;One of my favorite movies of all time.
778;That is all I have to say about this very excellent movie.
779;The Coen brothers do it again.
780;fact and funny way, Love the accents.
781;FARGO is an entertaining, humorous movie the likes of which I have not seen much in the past.
782;It was short (at 98 minutes) yet managed to develop its characters very well, and the plot line was extremely interesting to say the least.
783;The acting was quite good and, although the pregnant sheriff began to grate on me after a while, the role was performed exacxtly as planned.
784;as unique and entertaining as it is.
785;This film definitely belongs in the Top 50 movies that I have seen, but the Top 100 of all time?
786;It was worth it as this movie is a film worth owning.
787;I've enjoyed it at least 20 times and will without a doubt watch it countless more times.
788;In my opinion it is one of the best movies ever made.
789;the acting and actors all did a superb job"
790;this movie is a classic in every sense of the word.
791;needless to say, I love this film.
792;if you haven't seen Fargo, give it a try.
793;You'll likely like it if not love it.
794;One of the Cohen Brother's absolute best.
795;winning film by the Coen brothers.
796;Throw in a few snowstorms, a kidnapping, a giant Paul Bunyan statue and a woodchipper and you've got a classic.
797;The complexities of all the brilliant characters are examined and displayed with such mastery in this film.
798;Even with the dark and violent moments, there is a balance of comic effect which is well.
799;played by the great actors.
800;plots were very nicely done.
801;This is one I'll probably watch again.
802;This movie was recommended by two people.
803;Those are the types of movies that I really enjoy watching the most.
804;the ones that are based on something real.
805;it is a very quirky black comedy.
806;exceptional way of telling a true story.
807;She's no ordinary police,she has her special ways of investigating this case.
808;It's amazing to watch her portray.
809;She gave a stunning and idiosyncratic performance and totally deserved her Oscar.
810;one of the best black comedy screenplay even written.
811;It have all the elements which combined into a great winning formula.
812;Classic black comedy with touches of drama,comedy,violence,suspense,etc. all characters seem eccentric and Coen brothers did a brilliant script which filled with unexpected lines and wacky emotions and reaction by a great group of talented actors like Steve Buscemi as one of the 'funny.
813;looking'kidnapper,William H. Macy,Peter Stormare etc. this movie is so unpredictable and full of surprises and totally worth the time and money.
814;The wood chipper is priceless as well as the Coen Brothers!!!
815;Highly recommend this movie to all.
816;Just as good as I remember.
817;You have Steve Buscemi who does a remarkable job adding eerieness, comedy, and empathy.
818;He convinces me that his life is miserable and he has every right and reason to have people kill his wife, etc. overall this movie is funny,mysterious,unpredictable,and the ending is rather grim.
819;i just saw this movie after reading all the reviews about how great this movie was.
820;I loved the ending very much.
821;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
822;I don't know if this is the best movie the Coen brothers have made, but it has to be one of them.
823;Like all great art, you'll either love it or hate it.
824;The mood is what makes this film.
825;He just gets shot in the head.
826;Stark realism only for the really real.
827;Even though we get attached to Buscemi's scumbag character in a weird way, there is tremendous hilarity in him being shoved down a wood chipper by his quiet buddy when the two have a minor disagreement over how to split their ill gotten funds.
828;This is an incredible movie, but if your taste in movies is standard (another word for limited), don't watch it and get all high and mighty about the violence.
829;Never the less I enjoyed it.
830;it's witty plot ,it's fantastic script and wierd characters make of this a sensational movie.
831;a very interesting black humor film.
832;that takes away the realism.
833;That's reality and the acting was great.
834;Fargo is the Coen brothers best movie.
835;I did watch the entire movie, so it did keep my interest.
836;This is simply one of the greatest movies ever created.
837;The Coen brothers have a real knack for crafting stories centered around hopelessly idiotic characters.
838;In this film it oddly serves to move the plot along perfectly.
839;crossing characters, with a strong center in the protagonist.
840;Great movie today as it was when it was released.
841;I highly recommend viewing this movie before watching the new Fargo series on FX.
842;i like the coen brothers movies but this in my opinion is there best what an amazeing story that really was based on a true story it really is a very good and well written script by farr there best WATCH IT!!!
843;I always enjoy this movie no matter how many times I see it.
844;I love the Minnesota accents very much.
845;In this movie we see a car salesman namd Jerry , played wonderfully by William H. Macy.
846;"steve Buscemi gives a great performance as one of the crooks and even remarks after he has been shot that ""you should see the other guy""."
847;"There is one particular scene where the American Diet is poked fun at by the HUGE meal that is served at an ""All You Can Eat ""restaurant""!!!"
848;This movie is dark, brooding and also very funny.
849;better than average true story line.
850;if you like a really good drama its worth your time.
851;Fargo is a dark comedy that uses classic Coen.
852;In Fargo, the brothers take a serious story of gruesome murders and make light of the subject.
853;To do this he hires the psychotically funny Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud to have them do the job for him.
854;Throughout the film she stumbles onto leads that point her in the right direction and makes Lundergarrd break under the pressure and screw it all up.
855;Overall this isn't one of the Coen's brothers best films, in the likes The Big Lebowski, but it is still better than most of the movies out today.
856;Only the Coens could take us there and bring us back so entertainingly.
857;The midwest with it's neighborliness and value system take it on the chin in this crime.
858;drama which to date is the Cohen Brothers best.
859;FARGO to sum it up in a nutshell is a terrific film and should have been best picture of 1996.
860;Some reviewers here call this the greatest film of the decade.
861;Identification (or lack of it) is a source of great art.
862;The good guys are dumber.
863;"I realized, on the first of many viewings of ""Fargo,"" that the woman is not only a brilliant detective who ""cracks"" a pretty tough case, but she also has figured out life's most subtle challenge: how to be happy."
864;She tells all of us how to be happy.
865;"And, like Richard ""Lord"" Buckley (1906.1960) told us, it is so simple it evades all of us."
866;Work hard and use the gifts you have.
867;"Be cheerful and pleasant to others
868;did I mention that the special features are outstanding?
869;Funny, Serious and Bizarre all rolled up in a perfect package.
870;appreciated William H. Macy and a superb supporting cast.
871;The movie is unique, and manages to be both funny and thrilling.
872;An incredible movie with great acting and a witty script, one of my favorites.
873;I liked the characters and the plot.
874;Each character was unique in their own way which made the movie an original.
875;there are definately similarities between the movie and the TV series, and I really enjoyed the movie the second time around.
876;it isn't for everyone but it is really a good one, in a dark sort of way.
877;Still my favorite Coen Bros. movie.
878;The music by Carter Burwell is wonderful, the Rodger Deakins photography is beautiful, and the writing and directing by the Coens is sharp, sardonic, and engrossing.
879;This is one of the great American dark comedies from 2 guys who really know how to do dark comedy.
880;Good acting and a great story, very much worth taking a look at.
881;but it's a good movie.
882;not the greatest movie, but good or at least decent.
883;That's OK, and it works sometimes, but when you contrast this kind of writing with Tarrantino's writing in PULP FICTION, which has surely as many characters and as many situations, and all interrelated, the overall effect is better (in PULP FICTION) and more satisfying because the stories are focused, told separately, and have clear parts.
884;Said stories have beginnings, middles and an endings.
885;The stories are given in an episodic form"
886;There's a bit more to it than appears on the surface, and that bit is only revealed by careful attention to the details of the script and the picture's visual details.
887;"The acting is excellent, the direction's good, the cinematography is good too, and the story is told with lots of unexpected touches
888;Someone please tell me why The English Patient won best picture and Fargo did not?
889;far the better of the 2 and the best movie of the year.
890;So watch this movie and laugh and the villans in one scene, and set with mouth agasp the next.
891;Fargo written by Eathan and Joel Coen and directed by Joel Coen is easily one of the best films ever made.
892;It's got a great script, with witty dialouge recited perfectly by it's great cast which is directed perfectly by Coen.
893;The story is very smooth, this film is quite litterally perfect.
894;Buscemi, in my oppinion, is the highlight.
895;Both his voice and movement work so well as the character Carl.
896;the dialouge is some of the best Coen dialouge I've heard in a while.
897;It is a good movie.
898;I like Fargo because it makes me laugh.
899;Some movies are not very good but Fargo is very good.
900;looking guy hid in the snow but I could not find it, but it was fun to try.
901;This movie is a knockout comedy/murder mystery.
902;Jerry is an excellent example of the modern tragic figure.
903;also, Marge Gunderson is an excellent character.
904;The running gag of the midwestern accents throughout the movie is very well done.
905;Also, this film has some great dialogue bits.
906;The recreation of the late 1980's for the film is also highly convincing with the '87.88 Oldsmobiles (many of which today are rusting hulks) and even the scenery with such subtle elements as the Miller sign in the background of one scene.
907;This is a very entertaining movie, at least to me.
908;well, I won't say anything more about what happens.
909;Great movie with many surprises and the accents are great.
910;Of course, as with any Coen brothers' film, this is humorous, but in a dark sort of way.
911;The Coen brothers are geniuses.
912;The movie opens up with a cautionary text about it's factual origins.
913;Fargo is one of the movies that best exemplifies American cinema.
914;Each scene is so well crafted and paced with sharp dialogue that just so happens to be hilarious in parody.
915;The way it was filmed almost gives it a modern Western feel ala The Great Silence.
916;To add to it's effectiveness virtually every actor in the picture does their part to turn this movie into a modern masterpiece, authentic accents and all.
917;Robocop looks a lot better than this, though Fargo still looks great.
918;the performances are still epic, endearing and involving.
919;I hope the fx show is as good.
920;Macy is hard to watch, which is part of his character and well done, but not fun .
921;(nice IS underrated) Marge is ever so good at her job .
922;that's how they talk and I found it so endearing.
923;p. s. Marge's best line .
924;Quirky, deep, and very necessary to stay tuned.
925;Great acting and VERY WELL DONE.
926;William Macy is a good actor, was surprised to see him in this.
927;The actors did to a great job of playing their characters.
928;i would recommend it to those who like cornball characters.
929;just remember it is a """"black comedy""""."""
930;Fargo is my personal all time favorite movies.
931;I know I will watch this movie again and would highly recommend it, ya know!!
932;My favorite list for sure!The cast is wonderful.
933;The setting to so great.
934;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
935;My husband always wonders why I enjoy this film so much when I really didn't care for Pulp Fiction .
936;I forgot just how great this movie is.
937;ordered it since I started watching tv show.
938;Fargo, based on true events, will keep you squirming because of its on the edge of your seat 'I can't believe this is happening.'
939;The good acting is the key.
940;There's always a pair in this film.
941;I welcome, nay, implore more feedback.
942;end life, up to his neck in debt, bending the rules as he sees fit, and under the heel of his father.
943;It's not that all Minnesotans are dumb and crazy murderers and talk really funny.
944;Some of you are, yes, but that's true everywhere.
945;This movie is applicable to all people, everywhere.
946;For those who say this is a Pulp Fiction .
947;And if you listen carefully, you'll hear the very human, very important message that I think the Coens are getting after.
948;It was gross, and funny, and entertaining.
949;The acting was very good, the story was very good as well.
950;I'm not sure how the TV series will do, but I am glad I took the time to watch this entertaining movie.
951;The Coen brother's best work to date is a classic and must own film.
952;Everywhere you look, this movie is riddled with great performances.
953;But everyone else was just as great.
954;I'm a big fan of dark comedies.
955;And this lives up to the genre.
956;"The Coen brothers are very versatile filmmakers (as noted with Intolerable Cruelty
957;Even the score was great!
958;And the extras on the Special Edition are very good too, including a documentary with the Coens and cast.
959;There is a poignant aura to the film, beautifully echoed by a recurring high.
960;An exquisite moment: His date with a local hooker and Jose Feliciano and champaigne in a bucket in an Elk's club """"Only the Best!"""""""
961;The story line is great and sometimes bizarre.
962;And Macy should have won best actor and Buscemi best supporting actor.
963;fargo is another fine movie from the Coen Brothers.
964;Uncompromising, grusome at times, wonderful character study and hilarious.
965;You can win an Oscar for doing a great accent?
966;no matter how cleverly wrapped up in presentation, cinematography, or reputation.
967;Yes, it's violent and gory, but it's also a character study of a lot of very interesting people.
968;The script is so good and the outdoor photography is breathtaking.
969;The snow scenes are so desolate in sharp contrast to the warmth between Marge and her husband.
970;You wouldn't expect a murder mystery to be funny, but much of the dialog is laugh.
971;One can now actually see all the unsavoury goings.
972;I love this movie and really glad to get it on Blu.
973;The transfer is great and it sounds wonderful.
974;Simple but engaging plot set in an unlikely local with bumbling criminals and funny accents.
975;The Minnesotan bluntness of most of the characters provides a dry humor that makes one wince and giggle at once while the criminals are gnarly and unforgiving.
976;Fargo is a true classic.
977;beat sense of humor in Hollywood(and maybe the world), do a fine job here.
978;They manage to switch gears quite well, between shocking violence and laugh out loud hysterical humor.
979;this is a result of a fine ensemble cast.
980;The always great William H. Macy(honestly, is he not severely underrated?)
981;The villians of the piece are also very menacing and funny(seeing a pattern?
982;The actor playing Macy's father is also well done because he is so believable, so real.
983;In conclusion, this is a classic that will sustain it's power.
984;Just goes to show you.
985;This was a pretty decent movie based on a true crime story.
986;I finally have my Fargo movie!
987;Even after almost 18 years, this movie is still worth watching.
988;Great photography of the frozen Fargo tundra, chilling, funny, heartwarming.
989;Fargo is a guilty pleasure.
990;But when that little foot is sticking out of the wood chipper with the sock still on, it is hilarious as well as awful.
991;"Thus, ""Fargo"" is an excellent tragicomedy."
992;Joel Coen was nominated for a Best Director Oscar and won the award at the Cannes Film Festival.
993;"He and brother Ethan won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay while the Chicago Film Critics Association named ""Fargo"" Best Picture."
994;Her performance is excellent, underplayed yet funny, particularly with that exaggerated Northern Midwest accent.
995;Steve Buscemi is chilling as Carl who gets drawn in deeper than he wishes when his partner Gaear played by Peter Storemare lets loose his hair.
996;law with so much bravado that we think he deserves his place on the ground in the snowy parking lot.
997;Stephen Park's role as Mike Yanagita is an impressive cameo as he follows an inappropriate late night phone call with an even more inappropriate restaurant meeting with Marge.
998;It doesn't seem to further the story, but it remains one of my favorite scenes in the film.
999;Roger Deakins was nominated for Best Cinematography, which is breathtaking with the snowy landscape, especially the red snow in the wood chipper scene.
1000;This is a film that remains high on so many people's lists because it combines humor and what should be a tragic tale of murder and betrayal.
1001;That it works is testament to the talents of the Coen brothers.
1002;I found Fargo subtly hilarious when I first watched it.
1003;It is based on a true story, which is also intriguing.
1004;Also has a lot of humor, despite the serious theme.
1005;Definitely on my list of favorite movies.
1006;My husband and I had seen Fargo when it first came out and enjoyed the humor!
1007;Loved the movie and the series!!
1008;my son has been calling this one of his favorite movies for years, so I finally watched it.
1009;I was surprised at the comedic notes in it.
1010;Fargo became an instant classic when it came out, because it provides a fresh, unusual scenario which draws you in.
1011;So many movies are set in the flashy locations of Miami or Los Angeles.
1012;She's sharp, and quickly begins to unravel what is going on.
1013;certainly the plot itself is fun to watch, but even more delightful is the overall crafting, acting, and dialogue of this movie.
1014;The Coen brothers come from up north and you can see their love of their homelands in every scene.
1015;Those of us who live in snowy regions can relate to all of this.
1016;it's funny that many reviewers focus on the accents of the characters as being odd.
1017;We watch scenes in Alabama and accept their accent and dialogue.
1018;It's just a normal part of life.
1019;It's what makes life fun!It's fascinating to me that the role of women is ever evolving in films, but films overall still seem to be male.
1020;Here we have a brilliant female main character who is smart, engaging, and complex.
1021;And even so, she is pretty much the only woman in the entire film.
1022;it's certainly worth mentioning that there are some quite violent scenes in the movie.
1023;The characters, scenes, and dialogue are fantastic, and there are scenes that will stay with you long after you've watched the movie.
1024;highly recommended, and well worth its #84 ranking on the AFI top 100 listing.
1025;Fargo must be enjoyed and absorbed in solitude.
1026;Disconnect the phone and exile your loved ones.

1028;ray format are destined to make them appear so ancient!On another topic, the other disappointing thing about this Blu.
1029;So I really don't think the upgrade is worth it at this point .
1030;so, great movie, disappointing print.
1031;Characters gig the part perfectly.
1032;it combines comedy and violence in a thrilling story.
1033;awesome movie classic movie everybody should watch this at least once and when you do you will want to watch it again!
1034;there are few films I enjoy, this is one of them.
1035;One of Joel and Ethan Coen's best movies.
1036;I'd give it half a star if I could.
1037;Original story line"
1038;This movie is so unique, with the best casting, all the more interesting since it's based on a true story.
1039;I watch it often and bought this copy for my movie loving nephew.
1040;I think it is hilarious.
1041;That is just a ploy the Coen brothers put in there to play with us, the viewers.
1042;But it also showcases the sweet relationship between Ofc.
1043;The story is creative and it is nice to see a thrilling movie that takes place somewhere other than LA or New York.
1044;After many years I finally saw the entire film.
1045;Querky movie, well done, good actors.
1046;Would recommend it to others.
1047;It is a wonder to behold.
1048;The mood, attention to time and place and characterizations make this a film to remember.
1049;The Coen Brothers have slight ups and downs but they are some of the great filmmakers around today.
1050;This film is one of their best along with The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men.
1051;A story about a bungled kidnapping that leads to multiple violent deaths and leaves a teenaged boy orphaned seems like an unlikely recipient of adjectives like 'funny', 'wry', 'humane' and 'oddly beautiful'.
1052;But that's the impression that this beautifully scenic movie leaves.
1053;a film that uses the awful aspects of American life to point out the beautiful ones.
1054;The result is a 'feel good' movie that's about deceit and violence.
1055;director Joel Coen was also outstanding on catching the wild snowy area surrounding the lives of the people connected to the story of the movie.
1056;i've just watched for the 3rd time last night and I still find the movie very entertaining .
1057;my favorite is Macy playing the part of a loser , he did perfectly .
1058;i strongly recommend the vision.
1059;This was a good show, interesting all the way through, and very realistic.
1060;This one is more the way it is!
1061;It does make you laugh at certain times even though it is really a serious movie.
1062;But much to your viewing pleasure .

1079;"Joel and Ethan Coen have put more than a little thought and originality into their movies, and ""Fargo"" comes together in a way that is more satisfying to me as a viewer than the rest, and I'm a BIG fan of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother"" and ."
1080;bill Macy gives one of his best career performances as Jerry Lundegaard, who is a small.
1081;winning role as Sheriff Marge Gunderson.
1082;Marge is pregnant and full of North Dakota/Minnesota cheerfulness, but she is a serious and smart police woman.
1083;Marge then gives her version of the events, which the viewer knows is completely accurate.
1084;Her husband, Norm, is a painter and one of the highlights of their little moments together comes when one of his paintings is accepted as a new stamp.
1085;the thrill of watching this movie comes from seeing how all the elements of filmmaking .
1086;writing, acting, cinematography, sets, costumes and sound are all put together by the Coens in a way that is close to movie perfection.
1087;I watch it again every couple of years, and I like it as much every time.
1088;The new digital transfer looks great, and though Amazon and the MGM packaging says it is only a Dolby Digital 2.0 sound track, I found that my reciever picked up a full Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track.
1089;I think it would have been great if Criterion would have put out a special edition, seeing as it won an Academy Award and it's one of the AFI's top 100 movies of all time.
1090;I finally got around to seeing Fargo, and what a wonderful surprise!
1091;This is a movie I can watch again and again.
1092;This is a funny movie.
1093;William H. Macy is great and really show you what can happen when you are inept.
1094;i would recommend this movie to anyone.
1095;i can easily stream it online for FREE!
1096;At best, I was able to watch this movie with apathy.
1097;The peek of Joel and Ethan Coen's film making career came in 1996 with the film, Fargo.
1098;We will always remember great moments such as Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, and Barton Fink.
1099;I recommend owning this movie.
1100;It was very fun to watch again.
1101;Finally Adult Entertainmemt with a solid Script and Cast.
1102;Appears FX has moved to the head of the pack and hopefully will stay away from vampires and sudoscience.
1103;Full field this season but he'll be in the running and award bound against some strong competition.
1104;Minnesota Nice, the documentary which is featured, is much better for learning about the movie.
1105;"But the one scene that stood out for me is when Marge and Mike are having lunch at the Radisson and Marge says, ""This is nice!"""
1106;"To which Mike replies, ""It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good."""
1107;Watching this movie is always a treat for me.
1108;I totally understand that small town mentality.
1109;This is undoubtubly one of the top 30 best movies ever made.
1110;It's pure cinamatography, exellent performances, and top.
1111;notch direction makes this a timeless masterpiece.
1112;I thorougly enjoy watching this film and reccomend it to people who respect movies for their realness, as this movie is very real.
1113;It has some dark comedy in it.
1114;Fargo was a very enjoyable film.
1115;"Overall if you can't have it the original way
1116;Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best.
1117;This is the one that they will be remembered for.
1118;William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot.
1119;She plays """"Margie"""" with a huge dose of humanity."""
1120;She is a character that sneaks up on you.
1121;She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders.
1122;She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop.
1123;But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her.
1124;She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car.
1125;That's a good one, says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head.
1126;She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes.
1127;marge also has a core of steel.
1128;all actors concerned give great performances.
1129;i have read where this film has been criticized for making fun of the people of Minnesota, poking fun at their accents and manners.
1130;The Coen Brothers grew up in Minneapolis, and this is their homage to their own people.
1131;The folks in Minnesota may talk funny to the reviewers watching movies in New York and Los Angeles, but this film in no way makes fun of them.
1132;Like Marge, they are simply enjoying their own intelligence.
1133;Great cast and weird but true story.
1134;Could be one of my top ten all time favorites.
1135;One of the best crime scene movies that I have seen.
1136;Although there is no suspense per say in the movie, it's really interesting to watch the crime resolve with the intelligent work of the pregnant police.
1137;(Not for kids) Full of fun regional quotes.
1138;And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day.
1139;This movie keeps you glued to the screen, as the observer of a carefully woven tale.
1140;The characters created are extraordinary, quirky and memorable.
1141;loved this movie and have watched it a number of times!
1142;I spend time in ND on business and so the first thing that captivates me is the language and culture of ND which is quite true to life there that I could tell.
1143;the movie is an excellent balance of reality, suspense, and humor.
1144;There is some morbid and graphic violence which can be shocking but the movie is so compelling it kept me watching.
1145;it is based on a true story and claims to be very accurate which is amazing that such things could happen.
1146;FARGO is a great movie.
1147;The Cohen brothers did a great job romancizing a true history.
1148;The acting is very good.
1149;But this movie also gives us a clue about how strange Hollywood sometimes is.
1150;The main actress won a OSCAR only by saying O, Y , O, Y all movie long.
1151;THIS was my favorite film of the 1990s.
1152;Possibly my favorite film of all time.
1153;I picked another film as the best of the decade, but that's another review.
1154;And I get more every time I see it, which is pretty often.
1155;For instance, a friend of mine on his first viewing (always tell people that this is a very black comedy before you have them watch it.
1156;i love Steve Buscemi, and this is best role.
1157;possessed Big Man With a Gun is great.
1158;gun is scary as hell, yet he gets some of the best jokes.
1159;And yet she is amazingly effective as a police officer.
1160;the best part of this is the idea of the misconceptions most urbanites have about small towns.
1161;And Marge Gunderson is the most efficient and intelligent police officer to be shown in a movie since positive police portrayals went out of style.
1162;moments: the look in Jerry's eyes when Marge asks to speak to his father.
1163;One of the best black comedies ever made, Fargo is a wonderfully entertaining (and thought.
1164;provoking) film that explores the stupidity of criminals and the seedy underworld that lurks beneath our wholesome surface.
1165;interesting Steve Buscemi) to kidnap his wife so that he can soak his rich father.
1166;macy, as Lundegaard, is brilliant as we see him trying to keep his best car.
1167;Her interview scenes with Lundegaard are absolutely priceless.
1168;that's what makes Fargo so profound .
1169;Funny bunch of criminal blinded by greed.
1170;They waisted innocent lives but also got waisted in the end.
1171;Humans could be interesting animals in suits and ties.
1172;It was a great movie, hilarious and sad at the same time, I would watch it again!
1173;And has there ever been a more self.
1174;"But it is the Coens' magnificent screenplay that is the engine of ""Fargo,"" a brilliant."
1175;This movie is great and it is one of my all time favorites.
1176;Well paced and good storyline.
1177;This Vannilli (Cohen) brothers film is an enjoyable movie with good acting and an interesting plot.
1178;This is one the best storys told in film over the last 10 years.
1179;Part of what made the film so enjoyable was thinking that people actually did these things.
1180;Needless to say, finding out the whole film was made up from whole cloth took away much of the edge the film had.
1181;This is an hilarious movie.
1182;I laughed in the cinema, and everyone thought I was mad.
1183;just leads to a situation humorous beyond words.
1184;when art imitates life, we are lucky that life provides such class material.
1185;It has a good sense of humor, thrill, and a great plot.
1186;share) The blood and guts just kept going and until the credits rolled.
1187;This is really one of my all time favorite movies, certainly in the top 20 of my cannon.
1188;She doesn't have a bitter or jaded bone in her body, and we know her goodness will outshine and justice will pervail eventually for the whole situation.
1189;a wonderful movie that everyone has seen and can quote lines from.
1190;Hope against hope that the Coen brothers will make another quirky thriller like this again.
1191;An American Classic, this is the Cohen brothers at their best.
1192;Performances are stellar across the board and the script is among the best ever written.
1193;I appreciate great movies, comedies, dramas, artistic films, etc.
1194;Actually, the best part was when it ended and I could stop watching it.
1195;A deadpan drama about mundane, boring people with grand, impractical schemes, 'Fargo' seemed extremely small and slight on first viewing, but it grew on me over time, and now I realise that it's a great film.
1196;The Coens, untouched by the sensationalism that, say, Joel Schumacher would have brought to this tale, have made a masterpiece .
1197;utterly unlike mainstream Hollywood cinema, this largely music.
1198;anyway, this is a great film, one that initially makes you wonder what the fuss was about, but it sticks with you afterwards and you appreciate it.
1199;The acting in Fargo is great, William Macy and Steve Buscemi really deliver.
1200;If you love quirky and dry/dark humor than this movie is for you!
1201;William Macy gives a tour de force performance as car dealer Jerry Lundergaard, some of Macy's best work since Maude.
1202;The ensemble cast is perfect.
1203;What a great movie about the follies of idiotic criminals.
1204;Good movie to see that depicts how things were in the upper midwest over 20 years ago.
1205;This is a great film and the Coens best work to date.
1206;And the Coens being Minnesotans themselves, are in a good position to judge.
1207;Great movie, great acting, mysterious at times and yet very funny.
1208;This film is so unique and original that no words can desribe it.
1209;acting, directing, the story development.
1210;This is really one of the greatest movies ever and I recommend it to everyone.
1211;We bought this as a gift for friends of ours who had never seen it.
1212;No matter how many times I've watched this, I'm surprised with what I discover that is new.
1213;It depicts life in small town and the sheer innocence and joy and relaxed police force once they start.
1214;I have always enjoyed this movie.
1215;I enjoyed following the crazy antics of a pregnant sheriff hunting down bad guys.
1216;I give this a four star rating because it is based on a true story.
1217;One of the finest movies I've seen for some time.
1218;so long as you can stick with it, it's fascinating.
1219;Fargo was a movie I really enjoyed.
1220;The Coen brothers outdid themselves.
1221;Fargo is a chilling movie of murder and suspense with a comedic twist.
1222;I finally saw this movie after hearing a lot of great things about it.
1223;hyped movies like the green mile and the talented mr. ripley, but this movie was really good.
1224;Performances from steve buschemi and william h. macy are unforgettable.
1225;Theyare able to hind into their charectors really well.
1226;Iu thought the series was excellent in the portrayal of humankind .
1227;Episode six was a bit rough to get through but loved the movements towards and away from sanity by the main charactersSanity in the lives of the character soo
1228;FARGO is simply a great film, unique and beautifully produced.
1229;You'll laugh, you'll be appalled.
1230;still, you will always be transfixed.
1231;The Coen brothers did a great job with this one.
1232;still, definitely one for your film library, you bet'cha.
1233;The other goon is a quiet, big fella, who's name escapes me now.
1234;There are some scenes that are so gruesome and unexpected that you almost have to look away from the screen(and I'm a huge horro movie fan).
1235;all in all, this is a fabulous movie, complete with humor, suspense, action, great acting and a plot that never quits.
1236;see this movie, it WILL NOT disappoint!
1237;I just bought this movie and watched it, and this was a very good movie.
1238;"I believe this was nominated for best picture that year and lost it to ""The English Patient"", and I say that this movie should've won best picture that year."
1239;One of the best movies of Coen brothers and first.
1240;She is generous, considerate, sharp as a tack, and in her second trimester of pregnancy.
1241;the acting is excellent and profoundly understated.
1242;She is considerate and intelligent, though not impossibly so.
1243;It is wonderful to see such a great role model, nearly flawless in her funny way, chase down the killers.
1244;loser Jerry Lundegaard is played deftly by William H. Macy.
1245;Grimsrud is the quiet hulk with ice in his veins.
1246;Together, the two really get on each others nerves and provide some of the funniest scenes.Fargo is one of the strangest and best movies I have ever seen.
1247;The cinematography, acting, and plot come together to make a brilliant movie.
1248;Its unremarkable aspect is what makes it so remarkable.
1249;There are ironic contrasts and similarities, between the dramatic music and what is occurring on screen, and the blank landscape and the characters.
1250;The violence is somehow graphic and genuine, though not much is usually shown: Fargo is an offbeat and dour masterpiece.
1251;It is never really explained, and to good effect.
1252;This is movie making artistry.
1253;buscemi and Stormare are perfect as the not.
1254;this is a fairly realistic movie, other than the scene where Stormare fires a single perfect shot at over 100 feet into the back of a fleeing crime witness, who is running in deep snow and illuminated only by car headlights.
1255;It's nice to actually see a character in serious pain after getting shot, with lasting wounds, such as Buscemi's Carl Showalter suffers.
1256;It has some strange violence surrounding odd characters that works due to its masterful filming technique and totally believable and humorous acting.
1257;It appears to be a true crime story like In Cold Blood, but with entertaining comic twists.
1258;please Hollywood, spare us from watching over.
1259;It's kind of funny lookin'!
1260;I've probably viewed this film 8 times.
1261;It's disturbingly funny and scary.
1262;The acting is top notch.
1263;Geez those Northern accents get to you right away.
1264;They all have sickeningly sweet Minnesota accents so that makes it easy to make fun of.
1265;Fargo has to be rated as one of the 10 best movies of all time.
1266;Always inriguing, Fargo is one of the better jobs of cinematic narrative that you will see in a 90's film, the stylish direction certainly deserving credit.
1267;Roger Deakins' striking cinematography goes a great way to summoning mood (the nocturnal chase on the snowbound interstate is a real highlight).
1268;And Macy gives one of the more convincing, less caricaturized portrayals of the weasely type than you're likely to see in a modern film.
1269;But one of the 100 greatest movies of all time?
1270;"So while consistently interesting, mostly entertaining, and certainly original, Fargo is too heavily flawed to add up to a really satisfying experience
1271;These guys are really smart so they know how, not only to entertain with some mischeivous humor, but they also know how to make a deeper movie.
1272;It has all the elements of a classic Coen brothers movie with its cast of characters and bizzare idiosynchratic behavior.
1273;But again there is a method to all of this madness, which makes the movie all the more rewarding.
1274;Fargo is based on a true story, just make sure that you watch ALL the credits too.
1275;As a piece of art.
1276;house cinema Fargo manages to rise above its restrictive budget by the powerhouse acting that is on display here.
1277;the plot is actually very simple.
1278;This is done quite creatively at times with very many interesting set pieces, remarkable dialogue and some very memorable brutal and hysterical scenes.
1279;Fargo is the Coen Brothers most simple premise to date, but it is also extremely well acted and you can tell that everyone had a lot of fun making it.
1280;fargo does make you feel for the characters and certainly everyone is pretty much fleshed out and it is a film deserving of its acclaim, cult status and also remains one of the Coen Brothers's most accessible work to date.
1281;There are so many priceless scenes, such taut, spare dialogue delivered with the very blackest of droll humor.
1282;At times the acting is so precise and convincing that you'll think it's a straight documentary.
1283;Truly what an independent should be.
1284;I consider them a beloved asset.
1285;The more the scenes are dissected the more they are admired.
1286;I particularly enjoy the hooker scenes, particularly the one where Marge interviews two young hookers [known as the funny lookin' scene].
1287;In fictional crime it's a challenge to create truly believeable killers and victims because truth is always stranger.
1288;or atleast more frighteningly entertaining!
1289;Definitely pick up the remastered edition of the Coen Bros.
1290;It's also wonderful because it features the original theatrical poster art.
1291;I'm happy with it despite it not having many additional bonus features.
1292;As a Minnesotan I love any of the movies of our area, sort of querky weird but fun in a way too, even though it is a murder show, and what I didn't realize even though I'd seen it before .
1293;I dont usually go for violent flicks, but I found this one to be unexpectedly entertaining.
1294;It connects the dots and they are both hilarious stories!!
1295;I recommend this movie to you
1296;it's funny, it has high stakes, and although it can be ridiculous at times it's totally believable.
1297;Maybe this is the brilliance of the movie.
1298;the Coen brothers are great filmmakers and this is arguably their best film.
1299;It earned them a spot on the AFI top 100 list, watch it and find out why.
1300;I watch this film over and over.
1301;It's one of those singularly remarkable movies likeGoodFellasor perhapsFrom Dusk Till Dawnof which one rarely tires.
1302;I'm not at all hot on contemporary films in general but this one is truly a work of art.
1303;cop investigates the matter and she's a real piece of work.
1304;In fact, everyone who gets snuffed throughout this hilarious video saga.
1305;noir pretty much has it coming as far as either of us are concerned.
1306;what is specifically so marvelous about this film?CASTING: Perfect!
1307;I won't bother to recount notable specific performances and the appropriateness of the individual actors in regard to their roles because every single person in this film yielded a stellar performance and the casting director (John S. Lyons) has demonstrated a clear visionary gift.
1308;If you've never been to either North Dakota or Minnesota in winter, then you'll get a well.
1309;articulated feel for that God.
1310;How does one film such a desolate place and convey it in such a robust and compelling technique?
1311;I award this fine film my very highest recommendation.
1312;By far, the best Coen brothers movie to date (although I have yet to see O' Brother Where Art Thou? )
1313;I always liked the film Fargo.
1314;ray is the definitive version to own.
1315;Superb acting, not just in the two main roles, but the lesser ones.
1316;The two kidnappers are wonderful"
1317;Margie's husband, and their relationship, are perfect.
1318;A brutal but beautiful film
1319;Really enjoyed this movie, grew up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
1320;A friend told me about this movie.
1321;he said a must see, it was great.
1322;Fargo is a brilliant movie!
1323;The casting is right on cue.
1324;William H Macy is wonderful as a fidgety, nervous car salesman.
1325;Frances is wonderfully believable as a very pregnant cop.
1326;The story is so full of suprises, it's fun to watch over and over!
1327;:o) Fargo is a movie that has to be seen in its entirety to be fully appreciated .
1328;p You will love this movie!
1329;One of a very select few that I can watch multiple times and appreciate it more with each viewing.
1330;It is a very impressive and important work.
1331;i really think that all of the actors had a real affection and deep understanding of their characters.
1332;The characters have such dimension and depth, that you come away feeling that you have actually spent time with them as if they were real people.
1333;This is a haunting film, both extremely sad and genuinely uplifting in a way.
1334;The mood and tone of the movie, as well as the pacing, is flawless.
1335;But the editing is just so good.
1336;It is a truly timeless and beautiful piece of cinema.
1337;I generally really enjoy the Coen Brothers' films, but in my opinion this one is a real standout.
1338;If I had to pick personal favorites, Fargo and No Country for Old Men (both Coen Brother films) are on my top ten list of great modern American drama.
1339;You probably have already seen this film, but you really should see it again.
1340;If you have not seen it, you are lucky, and in for a real treat.
1341;A Great dark comedy, based on a true incident.
1342;It has become a classic!
1343;It's classic Keystone Kop stuff raised to cinema art.
1344;Talk about deserving the Oscar she got for the role!
1345;She is appropriately deadpan with a Midwestern accent, an offbeat view of life .
1346;and will always be remembered for the scene in which she points to the badge on her hat to announce her official title, since the guy she's come to arrest can't hear her above the roar of the now.
1347;I have always liked watching this movie.
1348;This is a great movie.
1349;I was captivated and disturbed at the same time.
1350;This is a classic movie you never get tired of.
1351;Depicts people as characters, not as beauty queens or super stars.
1352;I lived in Minnesota for a while, and the Coen brothers are from Minneapolis .
1353;It's an entertaining film, yes somewhat exaggerated .
1354;The acting and directing is great and truly deserved the Oscars!
1355;A southern woman living now in Minnesota found this to be the best depiction of true Minnesotans.
1356;The movie is a black comedy and while it doesn't have the in your face humor of an Adam Sandler film, it is down right hilarious.
1357;The plot is twisted and bizarre and the dialogue crisp and inventive.
1358;The film has a stark landscape due to the blanket of snow that covers the ground.
1359;Fargo is an original and inventive movie that is independent filmmaking at its best
1360;But it is something that can happen.
1361;the movie has plenty of light moments and humor despite the high body count and you will get a load of the Minnesota accent and dialect by the time it finishes.
1362;But all these elements are well integrated into the movie so that no incident feels out of place.
1363;The editor has done a superb job.
1364;this movie will be remembered for its lush photography.
1365;The brilliant white snowy landscapes will challenge your telly and please your eyes.
1366;ray transfer is obviously not top grade, but this is the best picture available on any home video release of Fargo.
1367;The sound too is average, but then this is a dialogue driven movie with some action in between.
1368;this is one of the Coens' best efforts, eclipsed only by their recent hits such as No Country for Old Men.
1369;Fargo is a memorable film that deserves a place in your movie library.
1370;My husband and I love this movie!
1371;I love this movie it has it all.
1372;The final scenes are priceless, it shows good does win over evil.
1373;I could watch this movie everyday and see something new.
1374;Steve Buscemi is one of few good things brought to the screen in Joel Coen's Fargo.
1375;Buscemi plays Carl, just one of the Coen's quirky characters, hired to kidnap a down on his luck car salesman's wife.
1376;Carl and his partner are two good for nothings that can, quite frankly, do nothing right.
1377;The sad part is that Fargo is based on a true story.
1378;Coen creates these bizarre and yet ever.
1379;The style in which the film was shot is interesting, to say the least.
1380;Joel Coen does an excellent job directing.
1381;The script is well written and the cast is well portrayed.
1382;In all the movie does come recommended if you can take the pain.
1383;I just watched this for the 1st time, and it was surprisingly good.
1384;I know it's supposed to be a thriller/drama, because it had some brutal scenes, but I couldn't help but laugh at a few scenes because of their accents and overuse of the line 'oh yeah' There were some pretty random scenes, but that's what makes it a good movie.
1385;She was my favorite character.
1386;Just another fun, classic movie not available on Netflix!!
1387;That's the name of the game in Fargo, a spellbinding thriller brought to you by the same people who brought us Rasing Arizona.
1388;the cop is probably one of the best parts of the show: she's pregnant, she likes food, and her accent really helps.
1389;The director of this film did this so greatly.
1390;there is plenty of action, and all of it helps.
1391;The whole movie is based in winter, and it actually helps.
1392;The snow gives this movie an original existence.
1393;"to read between the lines is a good phrase to this movie
1394;Don't worry, though, the Ye darn tootin and Ja, ja will keep you interested long enough.
1395;fargo is one of the best thriller films combined with tricky yet neat dark humor to come along in a loooong time.
1396;It's worth every cent of your ticket.
1397;Im almost positive it is in the thousands.
1398;This dark comedy is a true classic that absolutely must been seen.
1399;While the film's pokes at North Dakota culture are sometimes a bit overdone, the story line will leave you alternately laughing and cringing.
1400;It was similar and good too.
1401;As a North Dakotan, I mention that because those of us in that great state were all looking forward to a North Dakota.
1402;tV Midwestern accent that helps create the mistique of ignorance.
1403;beat enough to make itself interesting throughout.
1404;Much more powerful to have the entire film in my collectio!
1405;I'm from MN so the accents are great!
1406;The acting is superb and the dialog couldn't be better.
1407;if you don't already know, this is one of the best films ever made.
1408;Fargo stills a great movie , although the sound was out of sync The movie remains a 5 stars Bravo !
1409;It is one of the best.
1410;Great acting and a plot so bizarre that it almost seems true.
1411;This was the first Coen Brothers film I saw, and while they've made many other good ones (before and after) this one is their ultimate effort.
1412;and she took home an Oscar as proof of that.
1413;while it has plenty of comic relief as the opening quote indicates .
1414;Some aspects of the story are perhaps unintentionally funny, such as the """"Minnesota."""
1415;"nice"" behavior of the characters, and the distinct North."
1416;these features are actually true of rural North.
1417;Can you deduce from this that I really love this film.
1418;so many kidnapping/randsom movies are the same, but this one has amazing twists!
1419;The main reason I love this movie though, is that it is based on a true story with real victims dead.You should defitently see this amazing movie it is one of those movies you don't see anymore.
1420;Watching the tv mini series I thought i should see this.
1421;series is much, much better.
1422;A classic academy award winning movie.
1423;If you have never heard a Minnesota or Dakota's accent, you will hear the classic here.
1424;Seen this a couple times and find myself compelled to watch it when it's coming on.
1425;Entertaining with a few surprises too.
1426;A true and good movie, with some humorous situations.
1427;I enjoyed the movie .
1428;If you like the Coen brothers, Fargo is one of their best.
1429;Living next door to the former lady sheriff that was the model for the movie made the watching experience more enjoyable, but for years this has been in my top 100 movies I have ever watched.
1430;Fargo is a truly great modern.
1431;William H. Macy is able to gain our sympathies, even after all the horrible events that unfold.
1432;"Steve Buscemi is hilarious and perfect playing a weasily little man ""Wow, Daddy."""
1433;And to think that such cold, introverted people exist among is is chilling.
1434;Also, the Coen brothers casting of actors who look average is also very effective, not only in the main roles, but small parts too.
1435;The man who tells the police officer information on Steve Buscemi is hilarious in his natural, average demeanor.
1436;And instead of picking a conventionally gorgeous woman to be placed in the flipped.
1437;over car, the Coen's pick a woman with a kind of average prettiness, that's much more powerful because she is like people we know, and we can see her having a family and friends who would miss her.
1438;The music, also, is wonderfully sad and moving.
1439;but yeah, Fargo is very good.
1440;I watched this film simply because it is something of a modern classic but I found the plot pretty predictable.
1441;A classic Coen brothers film.
1442;Dark humor at its best.
1443;Incredibly, based on real events!
1444;so glad I came back to it.
1445;it's the Cohen brothers, so there is some oddball gory moments, and the dialogue and premise of the filmis true to their nature.
1446;A american classic in the great white north
1447;It was entertaining, not particularly funny, but good.
1448;It had the trailer, and that is about it.
1449;It is witty, complex, nuanced, and darkly humorous.
1450;"The first time watching ""Fargo"" is a wild ride where you must really pay attention
1451;I think the last ten minutes of the film is some of the best celluloid ever produced.
1452;this is a great movie, and I recommend it without reservation to adults everywhere.
1453;I also found the film way to stylish, so much that it overt took the film narrative.
1454;THe best part of owning the tape is that there is a preview for the film Jude in it.
1455;It also has a number of delightful comic moments, notably during Chief Gunderson's conversations with her husband Norm (John Carroll Lynch) as well as with Lundegaard.
1456;The acting by all members of the cast is consistently brilliant under Coen's crisp direction.
1457;Chief Gunderson may have a trusting heart but also a remarkably sharp mind.
1458;She wants so much to believe in goodness, to think the best of others, but she is by no means naive.
1459;In fact Coens have filmed the true fiction or fictive truth Fargo , telling us how men are really able to turn into beasts for a bag of money.
1460;So the catching fox will be rewarded by getting back home as actual pussycat likes better to catch the Zs.
1461;Each character is propelled past their competency when their perceptions of the pop behavioral roles they have self.
1462;all of the acting is delightful.
1463;Some of the humorous scenes are just a hoot!
1464;less mundane story is propelled to greatness by good screenwriting, good acting and good cinematography.
1465;very good film typical of the coen brothers
1466;This is probably my favorite movie ever!
1467;I was pleased to see it listed among the AFI's 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.
1468;The one thing I really like about the Coen's movies is that, as someone already pointed out, they're very unique.
1469;Definitely watch this movie, you won't regret it.
1470;All are equally as pleasing!
1471;This movie is funny, disarming, affectionate, shocking, and, in the very end, extremely sad.
1472;The best I've ever seen.
1473;one of coen bros best.
1474;lots of suspense and humor.
1475;This hilarious and disturbing parody on life on the frozen tundra of the Minnesota plains will surely leave a lasting impression.
1476;The comedy is so subtle.
1477;It comes across as a drama, but is filled with quirky humor.
1478;The charaters are great and the acting is perfect.
1479;This is a movie that can be watched every year or two and be just as enjoyable.
1480;plot that is intriguing .
1481;She meets him at the Radison I believe for lunch.
1482;He was totally deranged mentally.
1483;Like I said, its a captivating subplot, but what the Hell is it about?
1484;Good Movie and recommend it.
1485;The Coen brothers have brought us some really great films.
1486;But their masterpiece is Fargo.
1487;Having family from Minnesota I can attest that yes, the people up there do talk like that.
1488;The scene with the cop and the unlucky couple on a deserted stretch of highway is truly haunting, even more so in the realistic filming of the sequential shootings.
1489;bang action but if you aren't beyond a little thinking with your popcorn this movie should be perfect for you.
1490;The Best Film of 1996, timeless and original, Fargo is a necessary film for your home video library.
1491;Fargo truly is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1492;The humor is very dark, but absolutely funny as hell.
1493;Fargo is a great movie.
1494;The Coen Bros. put together one of the best movies of the last ten years.
1495;The movie not only was funny but it was thrilling and violent as well.
1496;The movie was good, very good actually.
1497;All the other performances are great including Steve Buschemi's as the ransomer of William H. Macy's wife.
1498;The plot is very gripping and the low score and cinematography was good too.
1499;I highly reccomend this film.
1500;Very well done and I fully enjoy it.
1501;My husband and I both really enjoyed this movie.
1502;Crazy to think it is based off of a true story!
1503;This is probably in the top 5 of my all.
1504;i think this is a great movie!it may not be for everyone, but everyone should see it at least once just to find out, it may surprise you!
1505;Except for the beginning scene of a car driving in a snow storm which has a lot of annoying static dust (looks like dust on sheet of glass), the AQ and PQ are fantastic.
1506;This was a great movie.
1507;It showed to be full of thrill, suspense, some comedy, and many surprises.
1508;Trust me, you'll see stuff you would never think you'd see, just keep in mind that the movie was based on a true story!
1509;Fargo, of course, is is surreal yet magical time warp in a theatrical style of binge drinking while under the care of a voodoo doctor.
1510;On second viewing, """"Fargo""""'s fun and surprises diminish considerably."""
1511;"The characters' ""yah's,"" ""you betcha's,"" and ""thanks a bunches,"" while fully recognizable localisms on first viewing, seem overdone the second time around (in fact, this time the performance of the two prostitutes struck me as the stuff of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit)."
1512;One of our favorite movies ever.
1513;So happy that we could find this special edition movie at Amazon.
1514;I love this movie and everytime I watch it I laugh out loud.
1515;Steve Buscemi is also wonderful.
1516;"The scene where he's driving to Minniapolis and tells his partner in crime that ""two can play this game"" (of not talking) and then can't shut up is just hilarious."
1517;Everyone one is right on the mark.
1518;Characters who are drawn with incredible precision, stellar performances by superb actors, and cinematography that will stay with you forever!
1519;Always lightens up a disagreement.
1520;This was the first movie where I registered seeing Bill Macy and he is great.
1521;The story is entertaining and funny.
1522;i don't want to give too much away, I want you to be as shocked and entertained as I was when I watched 'Fargo' for the first time.
1523;The film moves quickly, and bodies keep unexpectedly dropping.
1524;This spectacular Coen Brothers film has everything in it, suspense, comedy, blood, and horror.
1525;They made a film that is simultaneously gentle, intelligent and funny.
1526;I've watched it a dozen times and loved it each time.
1527;The Coen Brothers are among the most technically proficient filmmakers in Hollywood today.
1528;Fargo starts out quietly, with an ominous prologue informing the audience that this is a true story, and the names have been changed to protect the dead.
1529;(It a widely known secret that this story is a complete work of fiction.)
1530;it's better left to our imagination.
1531;The kidnapping is frightening, and the aftermath turns horrifyingly bloodly.
1532;she's seven months pregnant, waddles from meal to meal, and takes delight and comfort from the little things in life.
1533;what makes Fargo such a phenomenal movie are the little details that it gets just right.
1534;The Coens capture the look and sound of Minnesota perfectly, and the unique Minnesota accent has never received such a loving nudge in the ribs.
1535;kinda funny lookin') are veterans of the Coen Brother movies, but the rest of the cast inhabits these roles like to the manner born.
1536;Fargo reminds us what an American hero truly is, and how so many of our goals are caught up in the foolish pursuit of money.
1537;Along the way, it makes us laugh and frightens us out of our skins.
1538;After viewing this film I happened to be speaking to my brother, who is 8 years older and several light years removed from me culturally.
1539;"He mentioned that he had seen a ""perfect"" movie, and without inquiring further I mentioned ""Fargo"" as a likely candidate for that lofty description.Yes, it was this same ""perfect"" movie he was referring to."
1540;This is a marvelous example of how to tell a story on film.
1541;I have watched it many times and it always entertains.
1542;the story isnt really anything special.
1543;guy pays 2 guys to kidnapp his wife, guys screw up and [destroy] a few people.
1544;Fargo is a classic as far as I am concerned.
1545;The actors are superb and have studied characters from the area.
1546;This movie was very well done!
1547;Fargo is one of the best films of the 1990's.
1548;Filled with cold settings, quirky characters, and excellent performances, Fargo is an excellent film.
1549;William H. Macy's character is not a good person, but Macy's excellent performance is able to make us feel his pain.
1550;She definately deserved her oscar for her performance.
1551;steve Buscemi is great as always.
1552;His character is a criminal, but is somewhat likeable.
1553;Peter Stormare's character is underrated.
1554;I would rank his character as one of the best psychopaths, up there with Frank Booth from Blue Velvet and Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas.
1555;the plot is pretty simple, but you still need to pay attention in order to understand it.
1556;Part of what I really liked about this movie is how the plot is simple, but the Coen Brothers managed to create a story of kidnapping gone wrong and murder without having an overly complex plot.
1557;the score is very affective.
1558;It has a celtic feel to it and expresses the mood of the midwest perfectly.
1559;the way the film is shot resembles Stanley Kubrick's style, as every shot is like a perfectly drawn picture.
1560;i recommend Fargo at all costs.
1561;It has a wintry feeling that stays with you hours after you've seen it.
1562;After watching it twice I love it.
1563;I would recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the Cohen's work.
1564;mi think it fits in quite nicely with the theme of their movies.
1565;Great acting and story line.
1566;William H. Macy is the best
1567;This has to be one of my favorite films of all time, and it is the Cohen's at their best.
1568;Fargo is a satire, thriller and comedy all rolled into one fine package.
1569;the directing and cinematography are excellent.
1570;There are some great shots, especially the scene when Jerry is approaching his car in the snow (it is shot from above).
1571;Honestly, this is one of the best directed and best filmed movies I've seen.
1572;the best part of the bonus features is the interview with the Cohens in which they admit this is not really a true story.
1573;if you are a fan of the Cohens, or are wondering what is so great about them, watch this film.
1574;But I never laughed one time while watching this movieI didnt see anything funny about it.
1575;the best part of the movie was the pregnant cop, to me she made the movie partly enjoyable.
1576;She is the reason I gave this movie an extra star or I would have only given it a one star.
1577;ray works really well and the cover is a good picture.
1578;The movie, though is the Best!
1579;The film was quaint and gruesome.
1580;All the actors are great.
1581;i received my order within 2 days.
1582;new extras to R2 are:Minnesota Nice .
1583;nice feature highlighting where everyone fits in with the Coens through every film they have made.
1584;as you can see, the extras are pretty impressive.
1585;Quite simply this is one of the best original films with a great ensemble cast, and there are no weak performances.
1586;There are some quite scary and gory scenes in this film, but the overall tone is one of reality and comedy.
1587;Even more strangely, the demise of Steve is both shocking and funny in the context of the film.
1588;willam H. Macy plays the role of his life as Jerry, the man with ideas way above his ability to see them through.
1589;He is the one who comes with a plan to make money from his awful father.
1590;the other cast members in the background of this film are also superb, particulary the two girls who get interviewed by Marge and the man who tells a cop about his meeting with Steve Buscemi.
1591;Marge's obvious pride at Norm getting a wildlife painting on a 3 cent stamp is a joy to watch.
1592;The attention to detail and cinematography is brilliant with a completely bleak and white landscape used to stunning effect, particularly when Steve Buscemi buries his money beside a wire fence.
1593;The accents are just unbelievably brilliant.
1594;besides this film, but this film is just a complete joy to watch.
1595;This is a film to savour from the Coen brothers.
1596;A strange mixture of thriller and black comedy that will keep to guessing all the way.
1597;The rest of the cast are nearly as good as these two.
1598;The local dialects and mannerisms from Minnesota are all captured, and clearly a lot of time and effort went into this.
1599;Glad to see its finally being released with the original artwork.
1600;Some comic relief in spite of the films nature.
1601;It was exactly what I was looking for as an extra Christmas gift.
1602;In my opinion, this is the best Coen Brothers movie.
1603;With one of the most memorable finales of the 90's, Fargo is a classic
1604;I still found it to be very good, suspense filled movie.
1605;The good news is that his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) has a very rich father (Harve Presnell).
1606;This movie is perhaps the most brilliant realisation there is of that Chestertonian ambition.
1607;But, in the characters of Gunderson and her small time artist husband, the Coens offer up a beautiful and infinitely engaging but utterly unsentimental and credible picture of what an altogether splendid and, yes, downright cool thing simple plain old human goodness can be.
1608;frame perfect from start to finish.
1609;It's the Coen bothers best film which makes it one of the best films around by anyone.
1610;In places it's hilariously funny.
1611;The acting, writing and camerawork are all consistently astonishing.
1612;Emphatically a film to see and see again.
1613;Watching it again years later reminded me that it really is a great movie.
1614;The best thing was the woman detective with the midwest accent.
1615;very amusing to listen to her.
1616;She was a great character and made the movie.
1617;it's a hilarious, dark voyage through an almost unbelievable actual event.
1618;William H. Macy really shines in this movie.
1619;Steve Buscemi does not dissapoint, he delivers most of the comedy throughout.
1620;But the movie, if it truly is independent, is the best reality based movie, myself, I have seen.
1621;With all the hooplah about this film, you may be surprised to discover how mannered, self.
1622;The audience is invited to laugh at working class people and feel superior, while at the same feeling a cozy nostalgia for American homespun values, represented by an ambitious but pregnant cop and her toy teddy bear husband.
1623;He gives a marvelous performance (although he gives a better one in Boogie Nights ) so he rates a star.
1624;Just a great movie, wonderful acting and editing.
1625;A great deal of profanity but it was not gratuitous.
1626;i love all Coen brothers movies.
1627;they are quirky and surprising.
1628;This is really a great story, great actors and an amazing film altogether!
1629;"This was a pretty funny movie, it was entertaining because of the emphasis on the Minnesota accent
1630;This story was so outrageous and unpredictable that it kept my interest!
1631;I loved this movie so much .
1632;This murder mystery has plenty of suspense and plot twists.
1633;Great acting from all who participated.
1634;Fargo is a classic Coen brothers film with a great cast and unusual plot.
1635;You will be entertained !!
1636;As usual Macy played a good a tough part well also the rest of the supporting cast was excellent I had seen the movie years ago and it was still good.
1637;I think it is good movie and popular where I live from Fargo, ND not show off , ha.
1638;It's a simple enough plan.
1639;jerry's true nature is revealed early in the film when he openly lies to a customer.
1640;Carl and Gaear make their way into town and eventually get around to abducting Jerry's wife.
1641;It's 33 minutes before her character appears, but it seems like she holds the film together.
1642;While appearing a little slow and dorky, she's actually highly.
1643;She also gives the film balance during the scenes with Norm (John Carroll Lynch), her husband.
1644;They have a wonderful relationship and each accepts the other for exactly what they are.
1645;The contrast between Marge's life at home and the way she performs at work is startling.
1646;It's a reminder that people don't always tell the truth and she decides to visit Jerry again.
1647;one of the funniest things about the film is Jerry.
1648;It's interesting to see what he'll try next.
1649;the film's supporting cast is full of intriguing characters.
1650;Marge interviews some hookers who spent an evening with Carl and Gaear and there's a funny exchange: She learns that one of the men was kinda funny looking.
1651;The film is full of this kind of dark humor.
1652;I counted seven murders in all, but the quirky humor and tongue.
1653;This is a film that should be viewed as a dark comedy more than anything.
1654;marge's closing monologue is simple and effective"
1655;ray presentation is pleasing to the eye.
1656;Detail is strong, and the ever.
1657;It's particularly evident when the characters walk in the compacted snow and we hear a pleasing crunch.
1658;The violin used in the score is particularly effective.
1659;commentary with Director of Photography Roger DeakinsMinnesota Nice Documentary (27:47) .
1660;Learn what the actors thought of their roles and how they enjoyed working with the directors.
1661;You'll see a glimpse of what life might be like in small.
1662;town America, and you'll laugh.
1663;The Coen brothers have made some very good films and a couple of great ones.
1664;ray presentation is a good upgrade and I strongly recommend the film itself.
1665;A glance at the Coens' filmography reveals that they have produced some amusing fare in their careers.
1666;In fact, the desolate snowy landscape is the only aspect of the film that leaves a lasting impression.
1667;The scenery so overwhelms the story that you find yourself passing the time by contemplating the awesome power of nature instead of paying attention to the proceedings.
1668;I loved the dialect she used as well as the others from that area.
1669;This movie is easily one of the best movies of the nineties.
1670;From the awesome acting and nifty script to the soundtrack and cinematography.
1671;it's a movie you can see again and again.
1672;if you haven't seen it, see it.You'll thank me.
1673;It is quite violent, but at the same time funny, quirky, and totally fascinating.
1674;True dichotomy of human nature at its saddest and sometimes most hysterical.
1675;This movie is a slow movie, but a great movie.
1676;Real good movie all the way, nice thriller based on some real story.
1677;great acting by everyone, excellent direction and great cinematography give me real wintery feeling.
1678;Anyone who knows the work of the Coen brothers knows how talented they are as writers, directors, and filmmakers in general.
1679;In Fargo we begin to see some of this talent in the brilliant acting performances given.
1680;We have no reason to watch these horrific murders, and the Coen brothers realize this, and introduce the film with a fictitious backstory, claiming it is based on true events.
1681;A remarkable story, yet disturbing and sad.
1682;Best film of the year, hands down.
1683;The entire cast turns in the award deserving performances that are commonplace with films that have this sort of reputation.
1684;The rest of the characters are about the equivalent of those in a Tarantino film (Buscemi especially) and the overall final product is an intriguing blend of action and drama.
1685;This movie is so darkly funny.
1686;North Dakota is full of wonderful, friendly people.
1687;I've always enjoyed a movie with a dark sense of humor but few do it better than the Cohen brothers.
1688;The acting is top notch and the story is very easy to get pulled in to.
1689;I've seen the movie a pile of times and enjoy it fully every time, even still.
1690;If you're on the fence about watching this and have heard too many people say it's great, believe it and give it a chance!
1691;and the Best Picture award goes to The English Patient!
1692;In the lonely year of 1996 a film rose above all the rest and it was not The English Patient, it was Fargo .
1693;A smart, funny, violent film about a kiddnapping gone bad.
1694;Written by those darn, clever Coen Bros., this film is a landmark in American Film history.
1695;Anyway it's a very fascinating film, and it takes a great deal of humor, sick humor that is, but watch it and laugh at those durn Minnesotians.
1696;It's classic and should be owned by everyone.
1697;A classic: great performances in depictions of American Midwestern types, hilarious comedy based on the human condition, greed taken to its horrible, logical consequences, understated dialogue contrasting with bizarre onscreen action and plot.
1698;It just works in a unique an unforgettable manner.
1699;Fargo is a 'good guy vs. bad guy' movie, but highly entertaining and innovative in its use of characters and setting in the Fargo, North Dakota and Minnesota area.
1700;this Coen Brothers movie won two Academy Awards, but a warning.
1701;by many people's standards, this film is cultural classic.
1702;from my perspective, Fargo is kind of like modern Shakespeare.
1703;this is the film that really put him on the map and he has stayed prominent ever since.
1704;macy was nominated for an best supporting actor Academy Award for this role.
1705;she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role.
1706;the whole thing comes together.
1707;It's violent, hilarious, and shocking all at once.
1708;furthermore, it also makes you think about all the craziness in this world.
1709;the Coen brothers have made many films.
1710;Fargo is arguably their masterpiece.
1711;The use of this statement is to give the viewer a stronger feeling towards all of the films events.
1712;It constantly changes from comedy to suspense to satire.
1713;The Coen brothers grew up in St. Louis Park Minneapolis and this film is in memory of the people that they knew while growing up there.
1714;Macy shines in one of the finest roles.
1715;Fargo is without a doubt one of the Coen Brothers' best films, standing on a pedestal next to Blood Simple and Barton Fink .
1716;Fargo is on my top 10 list of favorite movies of all time.
1717;The plot is very engaging, involving many twists and turns.
1718;This film keeps you interested the whole way along.
1719;Just another quirky mystery surrounding Fargo!
1720;Quirky characters and a great plot.
1721;Winter scenes are very realistic.
1722;Very interesting accents that seem to fit the locations.
1723;Fargo is indeed an intresting Coen brothers film.
1724;there is very good acting.
1725;Margie the police officer is one of the better roles.
1726;The salesman's son managed to bring me to tears.
1727;an okay movie, with good moments.
1728;The Blu version looks great.
1729;This film is one of the Coen's best films ever.
1730;Fargo is essentially a morality tale fueled by the misadventures of one Jerry Lundegaard.
1731;his nemesis is one Margie Gunderson, played .
1732;In the end, she prevails.
1733;this is a good, at times, great film.
1734;The Cohen brothers establish themselves, in this early effort, as masters of quirky, alternative reality.
1735;It is this surreal aspect that makes the film's action so vivid, enacted against the bleak, backdrop of winter in Fargo, N. d. .
1736;The first time I watched this I had never heard of the Cohen brothers, and I thought the movie WAS based on a true story.
1737;That said, it is one heck of a movie and William Macy plays the most unlikely but utterly despicable of villains.
1738;Funny as hell is a good comparison: this comedy is rather dark.yet funny!
1739;The best features of the film were the lady detective (forgot her name, but she got an Oscar for this .
1740;deservedly) with her exaggerated Minnesota accent and the funny.
1741;Mr Macy is also great in his role, probably his best.
1742;i don't think this movie has a terribly big social value, or a source of learning, but it's very well made and written to encapsulate the small.
1743;I've seen it thrice, and I'll watch it again.
1744;i don't really see how this film has an interesting plot as some have stated.
1745;i started this movie with really high hopes based on other reviews.
1746;I really wanted to like this film, however, I found myself wanting to get up and do things all the way through it.
1747;It will be much more rewarding.
1748;Even by watching a rock get hit repeatedly by wave after wave of ocean water one can finally make oneself believe that those waves hitting that rock has an important meaning in life.
1749;A funny thriller,incredible charactersand unique setting.
1750;Rarely do you find filmmakers as consistently creative as the Coen brothers.
1751;Fargo is, most definitely, their finest achievement.
1752;In fact, it's one of the very finest films ever made, let alone one of the best of the 90's.
1753;Macy and Buscemi are really terrific.
1754;there's a fine score by Carter Burwell, and some stellar cinematography from Roger Deakins.
1755;One of the best aspects of the film is the Coen brothers' script, which manages to poke fun at Midwesterners, raise your heartrate, make you cringe, and get you to laugh, all within 98 minutes.
1756;Fargo is truly a masterpiece.
1757;The cast is terrific, the cinematography is excellent, and the script is outstanding.
1758;By all means, watch it.
1759;The acting is serviceable, with William H. Macy turning in especially good work.
1760;Macy is the only cast member able to transcend the snickering juvenility of the Coen Brothers' script.
1761;A film best played as a way to induce slumber.
1762;But adults will enjoy this dark drama from the Coen brothers.
1763;This is one of their best efforts.
1764;Very well done and intriguing.
1765;It's just dry, witty, measured and a beautiful bit of film making.
1766;Wm. Macy is perfect and the rest of the cast shines.
1767;what a little creep!The accents,the relationships,everything about this movie is charming(which is something to say for a movie with 1/2 dozen deaths that could only be called dark humor).
1768;this is definitely the best thing the Coen Bros. have ever done.
1769;just a last note:do not miss the last scene between Marge and Norm,it is a great moment!
1770;This movie is about simultaneously a comedy of errors, a Midwestern satire, a taut suspense thriller, and a violent tale of criminal misfortune.
1771;Her investigation is laced with offbeat observations about life in the rural hinterland of Minnesota and North Dakota, and Fargo embraces its local yokels with affectionate humor.
1772;At times shocking and hilarious, Fargo is utterly unique and distinctly American, bearing the unmistakable stamp of its inspired creators.
1773;Believe me this is a dark comedy/crime drama that should please any one with good taste.
1774;Straight story telling, unlike most present movie too much drama rather than clear story telling.
1775;Fargo is a strange movie but is extremely interesting.
1776;I loved all the actors!
1777;After seeing this movie, Steve Buscemi became 1 of my favorite actors!
1778;She was brilliant was just there!
1779;William H. Macy is great too.
1780;Everyone in this movie was great the twisted plot made it so outstanding.
1781;The humor is very dark but somewhat understandable why it's funny.
1782;It makes my top 10 list, easy.
1783;That's 2 words, but oh well.
1784;And the thing that I cannot believe is that this movie won awards.
1785;Yeah, the acting is pretty darn good.
1786;There are so many reasons Fargo is one of my all.
1787;time favorite movies that I don't know where to begin.
1788;silk screenplay written by Coen brothers.
1789;turn kind of story full of suspense and foreboding.
1790;however, what brings the story alive in high relief is the list of characters and the well.
1791;steve Buchemi has owned the role of the small.
1792;For me, Buchemi will never be able to transcend his Fargo character.
1793;The clownish stupidity of all parties other than the police chief is astounding but believable in this fascinating film set in the frigid snowscape of wintertime North Dakota.
1794;It even got selected as one of AFI's all.
1795;this movie is one of my favorites.
1796;i watched it many times and every time doing so, i get the same pleasure from it.
1797;i believe anyone who doesn`t appreciate this masterpiece has absolutely no idea of what a good movie is.
1798;I keep hearing such wonderful things about this film.
1799;"How original and quirky it is
1800;There was nothing shocking, or gruesome, or innovative about this film.
1801;William H. Macy is a true genius of an actor, no matter what role he plays.
1802;This movie has so many good reviews that it seems redundent to add another.
1803;I am not sure if it is a comedy or a tragedy but it is very entertaining.
1804;nO's committed in this movie.
1805;This is a cinema masterpiece.
1806;Over the years I have seen this film at least 5 times and have found it very enjoyable every time!
1807;First of all, it is abundant with fabulous acting by people, neither of whose names, I was familiar with, when I saw the movie: everybody is perfect in the movie.
1808;Each one of the actors fits perfectly for the role assigned to him/her.
1809;Secondly, it is abundant in innocence: Though the deeds of the villainous characters are contemptuous to the highest degree, they, along with of course, the """"YA"""" ."""
1810;inspiring, but also perfectly fit the downcast and stolid mood of the movie.
1811;above everything else, the movie is more abundant in subtlety, more than anything else.
1812;Though done deliberately, the movie is fraught with subtle humor, which gives the flick, a charming personality.
1813;The acting is brilliant, in the manner that just the straight faces and controlled emotions of the actors are enough to make us laugh, in the most serious situations.
1814;A prime example of the kind of outr humor in this movie, is the scene where Steve Buscemi, a crook, has a business.
1815;eyed seemingly innocuous sweet and homely cop, solve the crime with the encumbrance of pregnancy, is quite a change to the quintessential smart.
1816;aleck cop who arrives at a solution, in a trice over a cup of coffee.
1817;"the clever m lange of the unique set of characters made to act in an even more unique way (especially the ""YA""."
1818;A movie, way far from the ordinary, FARGO deserves a heartening applause.
1819;Complain if you will about the accents and the happy.
1820;chirpy residents of Fargo and Brainerd, but then put that aside and enjoy the rest of the story.
1821;Peter Stormare is frightening as one of the kidnappers, and the always.
1822;watchable Steve Buscemi rounds it out.
1823;the storyline is engaging and not nearly as convoluted as the one in The Big Lebowski.
1824;It's also impressive that they managed to shoot with so much snow and wind going on.
1825;I have many old movies that are stunning after their blu ray transfer.
1826;"Movies like 'The Shining', ""2001', 'Poltergeist', ""The Life of Brian', and 'Amadeus' all look fantastic on blu ray."
1827;"Could you call it a ""comedy."
1828;the accent is genuine, however.
1829;There is something refreshingly funny in the way the actors often say something that sounds so old.
1830;i also liked the movie because it had no ravishing girls or pretty boys in it .
1831;My number one in the top ten movies.
1832;I keep coming back to it every few years.
1833;First, I like Cral Reiner movies!
1834;I would recommend this movie if you like his humor, sound like this is a true story which I like.
1835;Still though in the grand pantheon of the Coen films I place this right beside their earliest masterpiece 'Blood Simple.'
1836;I'll have my coffee black and my whisky clean and both in a dirty glass.
1837;I had watched this movie on HBO and liked it good story plot and good actors.
1838;Cohen Brothers fan or not, this is a modern classic film.
1839;Steve Buscemi really makes a memorable performance as the small time thug.
1840;FARGO is the best film of 1996!
1841;Best labelled a 'dark comedy', FARGO will keep you on the edge of your seat with it's funny but sad overtones.
1842;"I don
1843;The power and excitement are always driven by (1) brilliant character drawing and (2) a perceptive view of the setting, whether it's all that snow and bleakness around the Paul Bunyan statue or the barns and banks of depression era Mississippi.
1844;It has a perfect cast and an amazing drollness about it that cannot be put into words.
1845;the movie is always in motion!
1846;It starts with the music.
1847;The words on the screen tell us what follows is a true story (although it isn't).
1848;It's what really makes Fargo resonate .
1849;It's funny, watching him hit his car with an ice.
1850;Funny right up until three innocent people die because of his hare.
1851;count will more than double.
1852;It's straightforward, brutal, and uncompromized, even when it gets downright bizarre (hint: it involves a wood.
1853;The characters may be eccentric and funny, the social conventions they live by satirized, but the core story is about greed leading to needless death.
1854;That's NOT funny, and the Coens (writer Ethan and director Joel) are wise enough to play that part straight.
1855;for all the fun Fargo has with its screwball characters, it also has a deep.
1856;She says a lot of things that make us laugh.
1857;Any film that could make that sort of line seem like a powerful emotional catharsis has got to be brilliant.
1858;It's Coen Brothers and their work, in my book, is unparalleled.
1859;An excellent film"
1860;for me it remains the coen brothers masterpiece.
1861;She's wonderfully talented and plays a pregnant cop.
1862;wllm H Macy's character hires thugs to kidnap his wife and hold her until her father, Macy's boss, comes up with a million bucks.
1863;It, of course, goes awry and the viewer is on the edge of his seat for much of the movie.
1864;I saw this movie when it was first released, and I thought it was an excellent film.
1865;depthinterviews with the directors and actors, which revealed their creative approach to bringing the screen play to life.
1866;I find it rewarding to discover on Amazon.
1867;Who knew that people from Minnesota and North Dakota could be so murderous and funny.
1868;This is one of my favourite dramas.
1869;I love all the acting in the film.
1870;Steve Buscemi is fantastic, this is a perfect role for him.
1871;This is one of those rare films where the acting, story and filming are brilliant, making it a classic movie.
