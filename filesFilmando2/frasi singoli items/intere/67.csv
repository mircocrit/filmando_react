1;This movie is excellent from the script to the actors to the cinematography.
2;I highly recommend watching if you enjoy art film or British cinema or even if you love a love story that will never work out.
3;I wish I could be more specific but I just loved the film so much.
4;This classic weepie still holds up pretty well and takes us back to a bygone age where people did not feel the need to flaunt themselves and their emotions in public.
5;celia Johnson holds this romance together.
6;johnson has to narrate the movie as well as act in it and gives a performance of remarkable restraint and power.
7;"Trevor Howard, the doctor, is a bit over the top, declaring in that thrilling British voice, ""I love you, I love you"" again and again."
8;it's amusing the note how British accents have changed in the past 60 years.
9;Nobody speaks in that clipped, hoity.
10;also we get a glimpse of the British class system circa 1945.
11;But Cary delivers a nice performance of a cockney trying to put on an upper class accent.
12;For the most part, it still works pretty well.
13;It is his best film, as far as I am concerned.
14;I am huge film fan.
15;This film is perfect in every way.
16;Noel Coward is a brilliant screenwriter and this is one of the best screenplays ever writen.
17;This film was voted 2nd best British film ever made under The Third Man (which I also love and Trevor Howard was also in).
18;a film of such perfection is so rare and underrated that it is sad that this beautiful film has been viewed by so few.
19;Sparkling, moving preformaces given by both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard.
20;Celia Johnson was very convincing and her voiceovers and facial expressions were superb.
21;The way the start the film out at the end and she retells the story is brilliant.
22;The editing is even perfect.
23;This film is very realistic.
24;It captures the time beautifully and how people used to have higher standards actually cared about their families, unlike the vulgar times of now.
25;capturing the smokey dark train stations with high contrast black and white.
26;If you like Casablanca, you'll love this movie.
27;I love ending because it is so mysterious.
28;Thank you for coming back to me.
29;Yes, the movie itself is superbly written and filmed, with brilliant music and cinematic effects.
30;Yes, it deserves five stars.
31;A refreshment room in a British suburban railroad station is a perfect place for a predatory man to meet women so innocent that they are not even aware they are looking for romance, so Dr. Alec Harvey checks this one out.
32;People with character disorder are accomplished liars, and they feel great pride when their lies are believed.
33;nevertheless, this is a truly great movie!
34;The true hero is, of course, Fred.
35;With what Laura calls his wisdom and gentleness, he is just the right man to carry her throughthe dangers of this brief encounter with an emotionally barren man who enacts the perfect lover.
36;Many great works of art come from the hidden depths.
37;I absolutely loved this movie.
38;It had heart, and the music.
39;rachmaninoff was perfect for background music.
40;I loved whenever someone asked for sugar with their tea.
41;This movie was brilliantly acted, the direction and story were just marvelous.
42;I have always loved this movie, and was delighted to find it referred to in a blog, so searched it out, and again enjoyed this wonderful pair of english actors.
43;It is a region B (UK).
44;So, in that way I can see this film as very relevant for today's usual type of viewer.
45;deserving of the main characters.
46;i also enjoyed the side story of the train station manager and the cafe hostess with their more down.
47;So the scene disturbs the logical story line.
48;Probably a lesson for us all, in many ways.
49;ray does look very good, but beware if you don't have a region B blu.
50;rays, however, this is a very good bd from ITV of a great David Lean film.
51;Everyone who has loved and lost his/her object of affection will feel deeply touched by this little unforgettable movie.
52;As the love affari develops in such a peace that it is impossible not to get in the mood with them, and root for the lovers.
53;Either a man she loves very much but barely knows .
54;Great acting and it ends leaving a smile on your face.
55;"This is one of my favorite films
I:8593;56;It contains all the elements of a great, yet doomed, romance.
I:8593;57;He's my kind of man!
I:8593;58;If you loved Lost in Translation, you'll love this.
I:8593;59;if you love Sleepless in Seattle and similar modern romance classics, see the movie that inspired those filmmakers.
I:8593;60;Beautiful, compelling film based on the play Still Life by Noel Coward (though it doesn't feel like a filmed stage play)and shot by David Lean (before he decided to make epics .
I:8593;61;The best thing about it (and this is saying a lot) is the two lead performances, Trevor Howard and (particularly) Celia Johnson in her crowning role, the only role she is remembered for.
I:8593;62;She, """"Then we must be happy without it."""
63;David Lean did an exceptional job of directing this film whom later directed Hopscotch.
64;the use of Rachmaninoff's Concerto no. 2 in C minor, helps set the mood and added continuity to the film.
65;And with that we have the beginning of one of the great love stories on screen.

67;"Their love blossoms, but they are ""sensible"" middle."
68;class people, and when they realize it can't go on, the good doctor takes a job in South Africa.
69;it's a simple story, not very much happens, yet it's poignant and moving.
70;The message seems to be that love can happen anywhere to anyone, and though obligations and decency be elsewhere, nothing can destroy that love.
71;for any one who has loved and lost, this movie can be nothing else but moving, and a great sad pleasure.
72;A beautiful movie in all respects.
73;Filmed in Great Britain in the 1940s, and therefore black and white.
74;A thoughtful, reflective presentation, from the woman's perspective, of a relationship that developed over a period of a few weeks.
75;I loved this movie when I saw it and finally bought it.
76;It's such a well written and directed movie that it was destined to be considered a classic.
77;subtle, moving actors and stunningly filmed.
78;Quiet little film with good acting on all parts.
79;"One of these ""slice of life"" films ."
80;It is the epitome of love stories with train stations on the background: e. g. Casablanca.
81;the film is made with clockwork precision and tactfulness.
82;There's something about trains that captivates.
83;Their last few precious moments together in the tea.
84;This will bring tears to your eyes.
85;In fact the pain will lessen and his memory will become dream.
86;the tale is cleverly told in that we are shown the end of the film at the beginning and then have the rest of it filled in in flash.
87;There is also a comical sub.
88;"room barmaid with a ""posh"" voice (Joyce Carey), and her aspiring lover, the Station."
89;the haunting third movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 adds immensely to the emotional content of the film and is at least partially responsible for its enduring popularity (indeed where would the film be without it?)
90;With its fine script and good acting and its nostalgic black and white photography of a time gone by, it delivers a unique experience and is a film to be treasured.
91;"and, along with so many other old films, it also brings with it another thought
I:8593;92;Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.
I:8593;93;the thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well.
I:8593;94;I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.
I:8593;95;But it is worth watching for a good laugh!
I:8593;96;This was a good story line for an older black and white movie.
I:8593;97;Its nice to see romance without all the smut.
I:8593;98;In fact, the bantering and humor of the tertiary characters in the train station's coffee shop was much more entertaining.
I:8593;99;This is a beautiful film that touches the core of human experience.
I:8593;100;It's also a masterfully crafted film from a technical standpoint.
I:8593;101;One of the most sympathetic stories of two people who meet, quite by chance, at a local train station refreshment shop and form a relationship of indelible love and companionship but are married to other people.
I:8593;102;In a script and story directed with infinite care we see the internal struggle of two star.
I:8593;103;This is a classic tearjerker.
I:8593;104;it is a simple tale that makes whole the saying, It is better to have loved and lost then not to love at all.
I:8593;105;Overall it is lovely telling picture that I highly recommend.

I:8593;108;One of the best film romances I've ever seen.
I:8593;109;The music, the acting, the plotline.
I:8593;110;The story is an endless tail of love found and love lost.
I:8593;111;The movie is wonderful acting from the leads to all the secondary actors.
I:8593;112;This film brought Celia Johnson acclaim with a well.
I:8593;113;observed performance and she is matched by Trevor Howard in his best acting ever, and it was his first lead.
I:8593;114;Watch it and remember one's own romance.
I:8593;115;the reason for that is explained that these were decent, honest folk who knew very well what they were doing from the start.
I:8593;116;despite the sentimental nature of this melodrama, Lean and his collaborators used restraint and let the actors, especially Celia Johnson to work out their characters' torment, which is as much of a moral dilemma as it is a romance.
I:8593;117;Of course romance it is.
I:8593;118;The word pops up in one of Celia's husband, who hunts for words for his crossword puzzle and asks his wife about a line from Keats (""""When I fears that I may cease to be"""") sonnets, and the word """"romance"""" fits."""
119;It is a node, and it signifies that he had some subconscious knowledge of what happens.
120;"He does finally realize that his wife had lived in a ""dream,"" and wisely he welcomes back when she is finished with her ordeal and the doctor is gone."
121;much has been made about the photographic wizardry of this movie and the Rachmaninoff music (Piano Concerto #2) which establishes the atmosphere and tone.
122;also much is made of the economy of the movie.
123;It is compact, fast paced, and immensely focused, for it is told from entirely from Laura's point of view, in a flashback voice.
124;In the end, it seems that this is the technique that allows the viewer to be totally immersed in Celia's psyche and understand her hesitations, moments of bliss, and despair and guilt.
125;This is a genuine passion, and, paradoxically, it is the doctor who makes the most important moves.
126;She hovers between temptation and a strong decision.
127;But the doctor is decent too.
128;This is a story of an intense romantic involvement that only between two married people which only takes the first step.
129;Is the end of the affair to be considered a happy ending?
130;for this is a real romance between two passionate lovers who, unlike Paolo and Franscesca (and countless others) did not end up in hell.
131;But they did experience that one unmistakable and sweeping feeling that comes around only about once or twice in a lifetime, and, almost always, it is more memorable if it remains unfulfilled.
132;That is noble of him, for he understands that a woman, even one that has the most refined sense of duty as wife and mother, can be tempted.
133;"for it takes a while for him to do so that the mistake is shared, that may be he is the most responsible, for he is the one who had asked for a second meeting, and the one who admits that ""something has happened."""
134;That style precludes scruples for momentary enjoyment.
135;And the heroes of such stories are usually amoral.
136;"Celia Johnson, as Laura, is stronger, acutely distressed, genuinely in love, and escapes with her life and happiness, though the ""dream"" may have unhinged her forever."
137;She knows she can be stirred to feelings that transport her to another level of existence, but those, as is well known to humankind, male or female, wound the most.
138;That is why the title fits so well.
139;He had made a much more successful, unofficial adaptation of Flaubert's book, via a Noel Coward playlet, a quarter of a century earlier, with his first masterpiece, 'Brief Encounter'.
140;the film IS incredibly moving.
141;We notice that, as a reader and film.
142;goer, how prone to flights of fantasy she is (see the glorious travelogue montage).
143;She is often seen constructing stories or moods .
144;because, 'Brief Encounter' is ultimately, like 'Madame Bovary' for France, a fierce critique of middle.
145;the very atmosphere of Britain decays the soul.
146;Lean is very sympathetic to Laura's agony .
147;'Encounter' is so focused on the couple, we forget what a brilliant, funny and detailed portrait the film is of post.
148;there is something poignant about a man and a woman getting together briefly, developing a deep bond, and then, like two ships passing in the night, separating without having consummated their relationship, and never seeing one another again.
149;i love all of the modern movies listed above .
150;they are among some of my favorite movies.
151;And I love film history, so this was a must.
152;see for me, to see the film that may have started this theme of Amor Interruptus in the film world.
153;Brief encounters of this sort do occur in real life, and no doubt audiences of that era understood the characters better, for this was a popular and acclaimed film in its time.
154;"in ""Brief Encounter"", everything is neatly tied up and returns to A. oK normal at the end, as Laura's husband tells her, somewhat cryptically, ""Thank you for coming back to me""."
155;Seejng the movie again greatly enhanced our experience with this production which is a tour de force.
156;This is my favorite British film of all time.
157;Brilliant writing, fine acting, ecconomicaly concise production and inspired direction all combine to make a landmark movie and a defining moment in social history.
158;She is talented and beautiful.
159;More than girlishly pretty, she has the deep resonant beauty of a full grown woman.
160;Her eyes are huge and so expressive, as she copes with the guilt and sordidness of an extra.
161;She narrates to move the story along in places.
162;Her performance draws you in and holds you.
163;Their screen chemistry is subtly electric.
164;There is a 'forward to the past' kind of message.
165;The film portrays a British middle.
166;if you've never seen it, you are in for a rare treat.
167;If you haven't seen it for a while, then it is well worth revisiting.
168;I thought it fitted since he wrote the screenplay, and the main setting is a railway station.

211;Film historian Bruce Eder provides informative audio commentary on an alternate track and goes in.

213;Beyond that, there is the original trailer and an interesting demonstration of the restoration process.
214;The powerful symbol of the rushing steam locomotive is iconic.
215;"I had seen this gorgeous movie only once before on ""Bravo"" (here in my country called ""Film and Arts"", and I thought it was a Masterpiece."
216;This is David Lean at his very, very best.
217;Sincerely acted, simply, with excellent, restrained, understated performances by both leads, Celia Johnson (what was of this wonderful actress, after this tremendous performance!)
218;This is one of my favorite pictures.
219;The actors, Ms. Celia Johnson and Mr. Trevor Howard are superb,.
220;Ms. Johnson, especially, can express a whole panoply of emotion through her exceptional eyes.

249;Even with the British reserve much in evidence, overall effect is intensely moving.
250;I see new things every time I watch it.
251;And I love everything each time.
252;Brief Encounter is an emotionally wrenching movie for the viewer who has, at one time or another, experienced personal struggles to contain desires that need not come to the forefront.
253;Among these passions are the perpetual excitement and euphoria that one feels in a relationship to the extent that this association could develop into an extramarital affair.
254;One can only sympathize, perhaps empathize, with Laura as she tries to come to terms with how events in her life have transpired.

257;She tells herself that since she is married to a good household provider, she has acquired levels of security and comfort that are higher than one could reasonably hope for in a marriage and should be entirely fulfilled.
258;with the transitions from one scene to the next, as masterfully laid out by David Lean, the movie is, quite arguably, a sexually charged masterpiece.

I:8593;263;no on screen sex,, no curse words,, no fighting,, just wonderful thoughts,, touching memories and gentleness that hasn't been duplicated.
I:8593;264;I fell in love with the actors, the characters they played, the music, and England.
I:8593;265;What a story, what a movie.
I:8593;266;The first time I saw this wonderful movie was over five years ago on PBS.
I:8593;267;The superb acting by all of the principals and the moving story of unrequited love deeply affected me.

I:8593;270;In the old days, trains were a good place to meet people, and like planes today, those meetings had a great air of expectation and could change lives.
I:8593;271;Brief Encounter was one of the last great examples of Film Noir.
I:8593;272;If you have never watched it, run and see it instantly.
I:8593;273;It's a classic love story.
I:8593;274;All of you hopeless romantics will love it !
I:8593;275;i read Richard Dyer's book on BRIEF ENCOUNTER years before actually seeing the movie, so I watched the picture in a Dyer frame of mind, and let me say, he was actually spot on in nearly every frame and in every mood.
I:8593;276;Now that's a great book.
I:8593;277;Its theme, after all, is travel, whether psychic or actual, and the device of laying most of the actual on the confines of a train station is a neat way of bringing in modernism (invented, you know, at the same time as the steam engine, so that a characteristic of both is speed) and to show the fractured, anguished inner workings of Laura's mind and heart.
I:8593;278;Every little thing combines to create a picture of a society at war with its self.
I:8593;279;Doesn't she look beautiful in her alternate, imaginary life, in which she finally goes to a hairdresser who makes her look good, and the gorgeous opera gown she gets to wear.
I:8593;280;respectable in a blah way.
I:8593;281;Thank God for montage sequences!
I:8593;282;She is a radiant actress and the shame is she made so few pictures.
I:8593;283;This is one of those movies that make you want to come back for more.
I:8593;284;The scenes are very romantic and you know the ending is not going to be good but still.
I:8593;285;watch Brief Encounter and you'll see why!
I:8593;286;As an admirer of David Lean's work and Trevor Howard's fan, this was the movie I had not seen.
I:8593;287;enjoyed the drama and found it actually factual.
I:8593;288;If you're familiar with the way a David Lean film looks, you'll recognize this one.
I:8593;289;It's a beautiful haunting story, with great acting and cinematography.
I:8593;290;Celia Johnson comes across as such a genuine everyday person, who can still fall in love with another man, even though it was totally unintentional, and it can happen at any age.
I:8593;291;It was a simple movie, but it is one of my favorite love stories.
I:8593;292;But she did have a simple beauty that was compelling, and therefore very attractive to her lover.
I:8593;293;This is a movie that I plan to watch many times.
I:8593;294;There are a few films about love that are so beautifully made and true that I return to them over and over again.
I:8593;295;i first saw Brief Encounter as a teenager and from the opening scene to the last, accompanied by the gorgeous Rachmaninoff score, I was utterly captivated by itbut what remains so extraordinary about the film is the very ordinariness of its topic and subjects.
I:8593;296;what happens next and how they decide to deal with it is so touching and so real that even decades after its release the film remains completely relevant.
I:8593;297;Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, with her incredible, sad eyes that convey enormous depths of emotion while she herself remains contained, are both perfect in their roles.
I:8593;298;Highly, highly recommended but please get out your handkerchiefs.
I:8593;299;Theirs is a brief encounter, but is filled with longing, ecstasy, and heartbreak.
I:8593;300;The narration is from Celia's point of view, and captures all the heady rapture of a woman's infatuation.
I:8593;301;Trevor Howard is very appealing as the nice doctor, and displays wonderfully romantic tendencies.
I:8593;302;an excellent depiction of how two duty.
I:8593;303;Both my husband and I enjoyed it so very much.
I:8593;304;Brief Encounter is an old movie which I enjoyed very much.
I:8593;305;This has made the movie special for me.
I:8593;306;I would recommend it to any older movie buffs however.
I:8593;307;A walk through the gift shop was a must, where you can also view the movie in parts as you wait for your train.
I:8593;308;After a while I watched a movie so powerful and rich in image, sound and the content "
309;This is my favorite movie in the world.
310;The story is beautiful, the acting wonderful, the writing brilliant.
311;the film takes place in England in a sweet, simpler time.
312;Noel Coward's marvelous sceenplay, David Lean's spectacular directorial debut, the marvelous Eileen Joyce playing the Rachmaninoff score throughout.
313;And into our romantic consciousness lodges David Lean's terribly British morality tale and cinematic legend.
314;bombing was still a very real threat in London).
315;Best Actress, Screenplay and Director (a first for a British Director).
316;He is a nice man and they are a 'happily married couple' .
317;lady played by Joyce Carey.
318;while Dolly Messiter is also brilliant as Everley Gregg .
319;but the movie belongs to its two leads .
320;They must make an agonizing decision and ultimately sacrifice their 'true' love.
321;It is Oscar Wilde's famous phrase moulded into a film .
322;and their combined work here is exceptional.
323;filled versions you've seen down through the decades, this wonderfully clean restoration is the best the film has ever looked.
324;you can now see her make.
325;up and lipstick* Laura at home sewing in a chair .
326;her perfectly pressed blouse and big buttons .
327;all gives it a new 'world.
328;you can see the glinting of the water on their coats .
329;beautifully clear* As Laura runs away from the flat owned by Stephen (Alec's Doctor colleague) where she might have given in to her emotions for Alec .
330;beautiful shadows and light* Sitting down on the bench beside the War Memorial .
331;the scene in the Regent Park's boathouse when he is drying his clothes and he so eloquently confesses his love for her .
332;I love your wide eyes.
333;"and the way you laugh at my jokes."""
334;There isn't a booklet which is a bit of a visual let down, but there are extras worth noting .
335;another point worth mentioning is that Celia Johnson's character is given the ingenious device of a 'voiceover' .
336;(his growing passion for her) .
337;"her joy after they've shared their first kiss ""And I'd said I loved him."
338;It's an innocent world really, so it was probably genuinely shocking to the audience of the day when Laura disembarks towards the end of the film from the train home only to run to Alec who is waiting in his friend's flat (a doctor called Stephen played so coldly by Valentine Dyall).
339;Are they going to consummate their love .
340;in the decades that have since passed, David Lean's 'frightfully' downbeat British romance has been parodied relentlessly and beloved with a passion in equal measure.
341;And yet it still holds a powerful resonance even today and is likely to make 'one' reach for a handkerchief .
342;Brief Encounter on BLU RAY is a triumph and both The British Film Institute and CINEIMAGE are to be congratulated on this reissue and its wonderfully restored print.
343;"In Celia's words ""I want to remember every minute."
344;A chance meeting on a train turns into a harmless, though touching affair.
345;(She was nominated for a Best Actress Award.)
346;The staging is first rate.
347;The scenes in the snack bar, with the tart tongued bartenderess are sharp and poignant.
348;"The supporting cast, all of whom hang in the bar are wonderful in that British ""old movie"" way."
349;Americans never did scenes like these as well.
350;"Those that watched Mr. Howard in the classic The Third Man"", are due for a surprise."
351;"In ""BE"" he plays a sensible, sensitive and caring Doctor obviously in painful love with a woman he can never have."
352;This reviewer would easily give 5 stars to the overall production, the secondary cast, the settings and that black and white filming.
353;Brief Encounter is a superbly crafted film with some of the most convincing performances that I've ever seen.
354;The film's plot, pace, acting and use of narration are wonderfully timeless.
355;It really is a miracle that a film made so long ago can be so perfectly preserved.
356;hats off to Criterion, David Lean and all of the wonderful actors in Brief Encounter!
357;Brief Encounter is the most romantic, sensuous movie ever made.
358;"There is so much ""electricity"" and passion ."
359;One thing leads to another and boom, they're in love.
360;Chaste love, but love all the same.
361;Lean and cinema photographer Robert Krasker open with great shots of speeding trains coming and going through the station with heavy steam blasting from their smoke stacks.
362;The filmmakers make great use of their sets with interesting angles and the use of shadows.
363;This is a technically terrific movie but at the same time an artifact of the era.
364;Entranced by this movie and its soundtrack when I first viewed it 15 years ago, it is a classic of superb acting .
365;an excellent presentation of passion and love without the gratuitous sex of modern film.
366;It will turn the viewer into a romantic, and most please the already.
367;This film by the Director David Lean is fairly massive in Japan.
368;If you haven't seen David Lean's BRIEF ENCOUNTER you are in for such a treat.
369;Every shot, every sound, every nuance [to this viewer at least] seems perfectly judged, and the film's economy is breath.
370;But it's the performances and that wonderful, wonderful script by Noel Coward that make it a great piece of cinema.
371;"Howard and Johnson are so impressively ""natural"" that one forgets the skill required to play ""real"" people convincingly."
372;"And the last moments of the film, when Laura's husband, we realise, seems to have ""known"" and yet remains so accepting, so full of love, is heart."
373;Weep for joy and sadness, dear viewers!
374;but once the story unfolds, the actors make it a very touching, very realistic encounter.
375;Celia Johnson is remarkable, and Trevor Howard.
376;in both literature and cinema, the themes of illicit love, the routineness of long.
377;"Turn on the afternoon ""soaps"" (if you dare to) and it's all there, just as it is in majestic works like this one."
378;Many of us have lived out these themes.
379;And that explains the general reaction to this film among its viewers.
380;This beautifully mounted, superbly cast and exquisitely acted production is a gem.
381;noel Coward collaboration traffics in ambiguity, creating an extraordinary interplay of delirious human happiness and nagging, draining moral issues.
382;"with Lean and Coward at the throttle, ""Brief Encounter"" was destined to explore these themes in superior fashion."
383;But what truly lifts this production into the stratosphere is the performance of Celia Johnson.
384;Trevor Howard may lead the action forward, but it is Johnson who leads forward the emotions, facially and vocally.
385;Of special note is her flashback narrative work.
386;Johnson nails her flashback narrative time and again, providing us with wonderful vocal work as her face reacts perfectly to outer intrusions or inner vexation.
387;And one also bets that, in time, both lovers .
388;still friends and lovers in their minds .
389;will come to believe that the opening of an apartment door at an inopportune time may have been one of the best things to ever happen to them.
390;And that's something many of today's younger viewers may never understand.
391;Beautiful film, with perfect cast.
392;It's a timeless story no matter what the year.
393;Made shortly after the end of the second world war, it is one of the finest films ever produced by the British film industry.
394;Concerns two very decent people who meet and fall deeply in love by accident even though they both are already married.
395;It is one of the greatest love stories ever put on film and deserves all the praise it's been given.
396;Very well done, it was on my list and so happy to have seen it.
397;Very well acted I thought.
398;What a gem of a movie!
399;Goes to show that with a great script (by Noel Coward), masterful direction (by David Lean), and a terrific cast of the most gifted actors, great films can be made on a modest budget.
400;brief Encounter is truly a work of art.
401;Celia Johnson's performance alone is absolute perfection.
402;i hope young writers, filmmakers, and actors will view this film as a beacon.
403;Brief Encounter demonstrates how much the collaboration of great talent can achieve without big budgets, salaciousness, and violence.
404;The repression of the emotions is part of why this this is poignant and powerful.
405;the film is gorgeously filmed, in black and white in post WWII London, when it seems that life is finally getting back to normal, at least for the characters here, who seem to be comfortably well off.
406;the real gem of the picture, though, is Celia Johnson.
407;One wonders how she can develop into the star of this romance.
408;There is a huge difference in her demeanor with her husband and social acquaintances, and when she is with the doctor.
409;Rachmaninoff's lush music adds another wonderful dimension to the film.
410;Of course those who look closely in these films will see that Lean chose only the best actors to flesh out real, true characters caught in the midst of overwhelming events.
411;witness Peter O'Toole's vivid characterization of T. E. Lawrence and Peggy Ashcroft's beautiful, indelible Mrs Moore from A PASSAGE TO INDIA.
412;"Whether the characters will be adulterers or not is important to them
I:8593;413;david Lean directs this adaptation of Coward's play.
I:8593;414;Many consider the Lawrence of Arabia director the best Brit director ever.
I:8593;415;The kids are sniveling but cute, and her weekly Thursday afternoon getaway in town turns into a lover's affair with Howard.
I:8593;416;He's married too and works at a hospital only on those Thursdays.
I:8593;417;It's all very mature those knowing grasping moments of happiness once a week.
I:8593;418;This is all very understated, a bone for the middle.
I:8593;419;Certainly this must rank with the great romance films.
I:8593;420;Some viewers may be turned off by this aspect but it is great nevertheless.
I:8593;421;The train imagery and its tie to fleeting relationships is superb.
I:8593;422;Noel Coward's script is clever, a model of well.
I:8593;423;spoken English and a pleasure to listen to.
I:8593;424;Tell me that it's true, that it's the same with you!
I:8593;425;Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 is deftly woven into the film adding emotional depth.
I:8593;426;There is a great scene where she tries to tell her husband that she met a man, had lunch with him.
I:8593;427;When husband does not seemed concerned, she, who has obviously been agonizing over the situation, is engulfed with emotion.
I:8593;428;And for those who love moments of romance, this has many.
I:8593;429;An absolute classic English movie .
I:8593;430;If you love old movies this one is a must.
I:8593;431;Any film that can draw tears from this cynical heart of mine is something very special, indeed.
I:8593;432;Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson are exceptional"
433;The screenplay is nothing short of extraordinary and the use the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2 was truly inspired.
434;It is an engaging film, well acted, and with a great musical (rachmaninoff) score.
435;"This is not merely my favorite David Lean film
I:8593;436;Instead of epic, the tone is intimate.
I:8593;437;the story of the film is paradoxical.
I:8593;438;The story of the unexpected and unintended love between two people who do not want to violate or hurt their loved ones is a story of moral and personal heroism as it is of love.
I:8593;439;The film is one of the most unique I know.
I:8593;440;the opening scene is shot twice.
I:8593;441;The second time, after the entire background has been supplied, it comes across as one of the most passion filled, and profoundly tragic scenes in all of cinema.
I:8593;442;celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were both impeccable in their roles.
I:8593;443;Like in so many great films, it is impossible to imagine anyone else playing their respective roles as well.
I:8593;444;Stanley Holloway, one of Great Britain's great character actors of the forties and fifties (who finally achieved Hollywood fame and an Oscar as Eliza Doolittle's father in MY FAIR LADY) provides comic relief as a railway worker.
I:8593;445;Shot in black and white, this film is almost a signature of the 40's, as was the more popular and successful Casablanca.
I:8593;446;Without mention of World War II, this film deals with internal struggles of the heart.
I:8593;447;Cecila Johnson stars as the romantic heroine, a married woman and Trevor Howard the love interest, a married doctor.
I:8593;448;It's a romance that is mostly feelings and emotions, furtive glances, sighs, talk and regular meetings that are brief in a train station.
I:8593;449;david Lean is experimenting with many techniques, particularily intimate angles and interior monologue.
I:8593;450;No film can ever top his Doctor Zhivago, but this film is at least second best and good for its time in 1946.
I:8593;451;There is a particularly impressive scene in which the lovers are interrupted and Celia Johnson's character must take a train trip with a very chatty, annoying woman friend.
I:8593;452;Another reason besides the great acting and the story itself is the fact that Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2, regarded as his finest, is played in this film.
I:8593;453;The dramatic, romantic storm that is the first movement, followed by a melancholy adagio, is very effective for this type of film.
I:8593;454;Brief Encounter is an unusual and beautifully made film.
I:8593;455;The direction by David Lean is well.
I:8593;456;paced and photographed beautifully so the film becomes a consuming experience.
I:8593;457;It is easy to relate to their lives and for their desire for each other.
I:8593;458;This film promises an emotional experience.
I:8593;459;Brief Encounter is pure cinema and a magnificient example of dramatic art.
I:8593;460;this is one of those few movies that you can enjoy its every second and it is guaranteed to affect the first time viewer.
I:8593;461;I am sure Criterion has again done a terrific job just like it has done with The Grand Illusion, The 39 Steps or the Third Man.
I:8593;462;This is one of my favorites.
I:8593;463;I watch it over and over and enjoy it every time.
I:8593;464;It is a beautiful story of love and duty to family.
I:8593;465;This movie is about love and heartbreak, sure, but the really amazing thing about it is the way they portray the ennui that comes from a long marriage, and how even normally faithful spouses can become tempted when facing the boring day.
I:8593;466;In this aspect, it is truly masterful.
I:8593;467;When she breaks down at the end, it was perhaps the most """"real"""" movie moment I've ever experienced."""
468;I saw this for the first time about 10 years ago and I return to it again and again.
469;The suburban housewife played perfectly by Celia Johnson does the right thing when she realizes what she was about to lose.
470;There is passion without profanity or nudity, and in the end, everybody does the right thing.
471;After reading about Brief Encounter and how it was one of the best movies of the 1940s, I anxiously looked forward to viewing it myself.
472;a lovely film, in classic black and white, with subtle, understated, powerful performances by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, it's a basic story of a man and woman meeting by chance and falling in love.
473;The woman is a housewife, also married.
474;while we never see the doctor's family, we do see the housewife, Laura's, family.
475;he's a nice man and she has a nice family.
476;You feel every ounce of her pain, her torment and her indecision on what to do, thanks to Celia Johnson's flawless acting and the beautiful musical score.
477;A classic for other pictures to follow.
478;Perfect plot, perfect dialogue, perfect cinematic choreography, haunting story, powerful message indelibly imaged by the massive, pitilessly punctual trains that encorce the brevity of the encounter.
479;For starters, I love post WWII British melodramas, and this is a perfect one.
480;I love the fact that the main characters are of a certain age (along with a humorous subplot of a romance between a shop keep and train station guard, who are also older') and that this film so beautifully conveys that love can arrive at any time in life, at any age, whether or not one is happily married or ordinarily so.
481;celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfect cast as the star.
482;crossed lovers, who want so much more from their new found love, but each, particularly Miss Johnson's character Laura, full well knowing that they cannot have each other, which is heartbreaking.
483;A brilliant movie, that could never be remade in the 21st century.
484;This is one of my two favorite films of all time.
485;Everything is perfect, the lighting and art direction, the acting, writing by Noel Coward, the use of Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2 as the score, and of course,the directing by David Lean.You don't have to take all your clothes off and moan and groan in a sex scene in order to convey eroticism.
486;It's very subtle in this film and tied to romance, which makes it better.
487;Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were perfect in this film and they were cast perfect for the roles as well.
488;The range of emotions, the peaks and lows are quite extraordinary.
489;An excellent script and great cinematography.
490;known cinematic romances to ever hit the big screen.
491;A friendship develops between the two and love soon blossoms as they spend more time together.
492;"Yet, despite the sense of sadness that lingers throughout ""Brief Encounter,"" it still is passionately romantic."
493;screen couple but their love story is touching nonetheless.
494;"Full of heart and full of insight, ""Brief Encounter"" is as poignant today as it was when it first came out."
495;brilliantly adapted by David Lean from brilliant playwright, Noel Coward.
496;"This story of two married people who meet, fall in love and then ""do the right thing"" is one of the most perfect films ever made."
497;Having read Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont and seen the film.
498;This story was delightful because it smacks of a time when people had integrity.
499;Interesting story of intrigue and romance which teaches a lesson that 'the grass is not always greener' elsewhere than in your marriage.
500;At last, my wife and I have been able to enjoy this classic tale of desire, deception and despair in all its black.
501;The restoration is immaculate, every frame crystal clear, and the soundtrack is perfection.
502;this movie is sublimely directed by David Lean, whose use of the charging train is quite powerful and symbolic.
503;This movie is quite unique in how it is very moral, yet shows the nature of temptation in a very realistic and not stagey way or with guile, which most relational stories suffer from today.
504;The passions are real and so is the struggle.
505;It is so very honest.
506;adding more depth is the way in which the story stays within the bounds but allows one to travel the experience.
507;Although, I think the depth of acting and excellent writing and cinematography succeeds for all.
508;It provides something for contemporary people that the story of Samson or David cannot.
509;the incidental music is Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto #2, with Eileen Joyce skillfully playing the piano and conducted by Muir Mathieson with the National Symphony Orchestra.
510;this movie is in my top ten best made movies.
511;it fulfills precisely what John Gardner said is necessary in a story.
512;Saw this wonderful film 50 years ago.
513;It was great to find it again.
514;"Criterion Collection"" is a gorgeous restoration of an exceptional and enduring work of art."
515;A fantastic film, with brillant acting that is subtle and realistic, and although the dialogue seems a little dated at first, after the first few minutes you forget all about this and are totally emersed in what is understandably a classic film.
516;It's not often that I am so emotional after a film that I just sit there for 10 minutes or so, not wanting to move, but this film had this effect on me, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and real romance.
517;A heartfelt story about a unexpected love affair between two person's who meet and fall in love, but who are married to others.
518;The chance meetings with persons the woman knows, and how she attempts to cover their relationship.
519;This masterful film shows how hungry normal, ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting, and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with.
520;So they find it one day, accidentally, illicitly, secretly, dishonestly, soul wrenchingly in a stranger.
521;I think this movie has a powerful message for our times.
522;I love the way the film ends, with repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation.
523;This film is a timeless gem.
524;Prior to Brief Encounter Lean had directed This Happy Breed, the story of a Southwest London family up to the advent of World War Two.
525;Their integrity provides pressures which do not surface with individuals lacking their levels of advanced character.
526;the use of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto Number Two in C Minor serves as the perfect backdrop as Johnson ruminates narratively about her love for Howard.
527;One of the most uniquely memorable scenes in film annals occurs when, at a time when Howard would like to say goodbye with proper affection to Johnson at the Milford Junction train station, where so much of the film's action occurs, the opportunity is destroyed with the emergence of a well.
528;As a result, when Howard's train arrives he is compelled to restrict himself to a properly polite verbal goodbye with an accompanying affectionate tug on the shoulder.
529;another interesting element of the brilliant Noel Coward screenplay is the train station flirtations between two of Britain's foremost character performers.
530;Joyce Carey, who runs the station snack bar, and Stanley Holloway, the local station master, engage in perpetual flirtation.
531;Coward's successful ploy is to add a touch of levity to a story dominated by a profoundly dramatic love affair doomed to end without the level of fulfillment each party sought.
532;Thirty years ago, Brief Encounter was one of the popular movies played on late night TV.
533;Whenever it was scheduled, I looked forward to it with great anticipation.
534;I always forget what a masterpiece of cinema David Lean's Brief Encounter is, but am instantly reminded when I sit down again to be mesmerized by its spell.
535;On the contrary, Noel Coward's drama is transformed into something uniquely cinematic.
