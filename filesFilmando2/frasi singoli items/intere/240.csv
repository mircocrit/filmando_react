1;face as today, Hardcore has significance.
2;There are so many inside.
3;Having graduated from there myself, i perfectly understand why.
4;this film is the most autobiographical religious story I have ever seen.
5;Cable edited a bit here and there, I could tell.
6;And so over the top, it gets funny, even though the subject is anything but.
7;one dozen?Agree or disagree with it, this is an excellent, well acted, well written movie.
8;It is the perfect description of this movie.
9;"For those of you familiar with George C Scott in ""Patton,"" this movie is a great new side to him."
10;He brings his typically unhinged persona into his father.
11;schrader is a great writer, but competant director.
12;"He can certainly tell a tale, but while ""Taxi Driver"" is incredible, this is only a journeyman at work as director."
13;It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged.
14;When looking at it through today's more jaded eyes, it is almost funny how much this world is caricatured in this movie.
15;The fashions and mannerisms of the characters in what was a much more innocent in some ways and much more dangerous world in others compared to today are fascinating.
16;George C. Scott is a sly fudgey.
17;This is a fascinating look into how porn really evolved in the 70's.
18;A must see for lovers of anything vintage specially if your are fascinated with the seedy side of how things use to be.
19;As old as this may be, it's still resonates true to always keeping a watchful eye on your kids without being too overbearing for we see in this movie what can happen.
20;Peter Boyle is good as the detective and Season Hubley is interesting as the prostitute who gives you her ideas on life in the business.
21;this is a fascinating film in parts but also very tough to view in a number of areas.
22;in summary, a very powerful but brutal movie to watch, especially if you have kids of your own.
23;The film's establishing shots of the Midwest Calvinist world are superb as well.
24;It's a credit to Scott's superior acting ability that the film and not he appear silly.
25;It would also have helped that we knew a little more about his daughter for us to sympathize with his plight.
26;This film can also be viewed as a decent time.
27;And you know what, you believe him.
28;I found it eye opening and well worth knowing about
29;Season Hubley does a good job for her (short) part of the film, reminding me of Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver.
30;I am very appreciative that great actors, like George, do these movies to help get this information out of the 'unknown' and shedding light on these horrors.
31;"i feel it has inspired movies like ""Taken"" (Liam Neeson)and ""Ransom"" (Mel Gibson)."
32;hardcore will shock you,and make you realize what some folks will do for their children.
33;this is truly one of my top 10 favorites.
34;Schrader's HARDCORE has been one of my favorite films ever since I first saw it nearly 25 years ago.
35;Scott is as good as I've ever seen him, and Season Hubley makes me wish she'd had this kind of material for more of her career.
36;Schrader's Calvinist background collides violently with the latter 20th century, and the results are frequently amazing and quite thought.
37;For its seedy subject matter, this is a radically religious, moral, and ethical film, and a worthy successor to Schrader's TAXI DRIVER script.
38;A must for every serious film collection!
39;Just saw this for the first time since the ON TV cable days of the early 80's when I was 11 or 12, and I came away thinking two things:#1.
40;This is really a very powerful and disturbing movie.
41;So George poses as a Porno Producer and beats up a lot of guys as he tries to find her.
42;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!
43;What makes this portrayal of the the porno world so interesting is that it throws a religious, mid.
44;wrenching scenes of all time: I won't give too much away.
45;Indeed, how true this is.
46;I'm not sure the viewer belongs in this picture either, other than catching an opportunity to watch an amazing performance by one of America's greatest actors.
47;Films like this opened the door for the much more violent, but engaging 8MM.
48;Come to think of it, neither do we, save Mr. Scott's magnificent performance.
49;he got a lot more confident with AMERICAN GIGOLO in 1980.
50;This movie is just a fun time capsule piece.
51;This is a must see movie.
52;You will want to watch it over and over and then share it with your friends.
53;existing interest in the darker aspect of human sexuality, I was intrigued by the content of this film.
54;It's a realm which is diametrically opposed to his conservative religious beliefs.
55;This is an eerie but surreal sequence of scenes.
56;"It's quite effective
57;The Bottom Line:Better than Taken, 8MM, or (dare I even say it?)
58;The Searchers in showing how the obsessive quest to find a lost girl in a seedy milieu corrupts the man trying to find her, Hardcore is perhaps sometimes guilty of exploiting the pornographic material it wallows in, but it's a powerful film that deals in shades of moral ambiguity and is all the better for it"
59;brings the audience another dehumanizing urban environment with this film and delivers quite a memorable movie.3.5/4
60;I loved it than and i love it now.
61;Good plot, good acting and for those of you whom are into the 70s era you will love it.
62;"First we see the hardcore"" world of straightlaced Jake VanDorn (George C. Scott.)"
63;He lives in a world so structured that everything in his life is alphabetized in his hardcore religious faith.
64;It is such a world that drove away his wife and drove away his daughter to seek warmth in another world equally as hardcore.
65;"The next window display has a pornographic image, and the writing above it ""love act""."
66;George C. Scott is an awesome actor.
67;He and the other actors here, especially Peter Boyle, hold your interest throughout.
68;i also liked the fact that this movie was made in an age when there were no fake boobs, and everything you see here is natural.
69;Heck, women were even allowed to have flat chests in those days, and could still be considered beautiful.
70;(Wish it were still that way!)
71;I realize it was part of the character.
72;stache he wore for one scene was hilarious, perhaps intentionally so :)It's also interesting to note that I counted no less than 3 plugs for Star Wars in this movie, which were fairly conspicuous.
73;Peter Boyle also shines as the private investigator.
74;This movie is rated R for obvious reasons.
75;He also meets and deals with all the people that are a part of this world.
76;Scotts portrayal of the father is fascinating.
77;He is self serving and out for his own interest but he is also an ally to Scott who knows the underbelly of the big city and who and where to look.
78;If you are a George C. Scott fan it is a must.
79;This is perhaps one of George C. Scotts most dramatic and sometimes humerous performances.
80;I disagree, I think the film works and that Schrader delivers an entertaining and sometimes uncomfortable look at the world of pornography.
81;"Look for George C. Scott in a powerful tour de force performance in ""Hardcore"""
82;Businessman Jake Van Doren's(George C. Scott in a riveting, brilliant performance) life and his deeply held religious beliefs are shaken to their core.
83;"this riveting drama from Paul Schrader (""Taxi Driver"")clearly draws from some of Schrader's own convictions and religious beliefs."
84;"since ""Hardcore"" deals heavily with the sex industry of the late 70s it's obvious that the film isn't for everyone, but if you can handle it this is a nigh work of genius."
85;"Part drama, part thriller, with a bit o' black humor thrown in for good measure, ""Hardcore"" is simply fascinating."
86;"as another reviewer so perfectly notes, ""Hardcore"" explores the dichotomy and similarities of people who live 'hardcore.'"
87;Jake's Dutch Calvinist religious faith is so hardcore and rigidly structured that he can explain it in.
88;this is a smart film that doesn't spell everything out, but if you watch it closely details emerge.
89;"It becomes clear that the VanDorn household was overly rigid and sterile
90;despite Jake's serious pride issues and the sterility of his household, his Calvinism comes off better than the hedonism of late 70's L. a. Jake is on a crusade into the land of heathen and is admirable in that he puts himself in harm's way to find his daughter, and he never succumbs in a land of a thousand temptations.
91;The first few steps are exciting and the rest are horrible but tolerable.
92;the first hour starts to get rather tedious with Jake's intro to the sex industry and ensuing search for his daughter but, take heart, the story picks up in the second half with the introduction of Niki.
93;Her relationship with Jake is the heart of the picture.
94;(In a way, yes, but that's another subject"
95;Jake merely hires her to help in his search and unexpectedly finds himself getting close to her, enjoying her company, and vice versa.
96;Jake isn't in any way, shape or form an evangelist but he finds that he can open up and freely discuss his Christian beliefs with Niki, and she's just as free and comfortable to discuss her beliefs (she's a Venusian, whatever that is, lol).
97;"Hardcore is so incredible and original because these characters are ""real"" and they really talk."
98;"Yet, she's not arrogant about her insights
99;***END SPOILER***Some complain about the ending but I think it works pretty well"
100;After he successfully finds his daughter he looks at Niki from a distance and she looks at him to discern his intent (will he offer succor or not?)
101;It's a heartbreaking scene, but I guess more realistic than Jake taking her back to Michigan.
102;"She was very young and therefore still beautiful
