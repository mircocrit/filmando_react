1;This a classic film a must have for all collectors of Chanbara ( Japanese sword Fighting) films.
2;The images on Blue are more crisp and clear on my 65 plasma but I prefer the original aspect and panoramic views that are in particular a Hallmark of Kurosawa's genius.
3;Again that's a personal choice.
4;If you are into Kurosawa's battle war films, you will enjoy the epic drama of Kagemusha (Kawgaymoosha).
5;But it most certainly deserves a second viewing, as it can become confusing with doubles and flashback.
6;The impressive costumes lend to the reality of the period.
7;known as an epic drama, the film takes place in Japan during the 1500's.
8;The thief becomes comfortable as the leader of the clan and then, onto defend his clan.
9;With that, you will see lengthy battle scenes.
10;The interview with the pair is very insightful.
11;Also another excellent interview provides extensive details about the Master and making of the film.
12;one of Kurosawa's best, if not one of the best films of all time .
13;it also deals with the same time period and uses some of the same techniques and actors as Kagemusha, but all in a better and more sophisticated way.
14;Kurosawa focuses on the double and his attempts at acting as Lord Shingen for three years: both the original Lord and the double are played by Tatsuya Nakadai ('Yojimbo,' 'Ran') in a masterful performance.
15;indeed, the double's experience as the Lord is really the heart of the film, not the battles or clan rivalries per se.
16;As in many Kurosawa films, class plays a subtle yet important role: the double was a thief who now must impersonate a Lord, and ironies abound thoughout the film (but especially at the end) about the way the double is in many ways more noble than the original Lord.
17;perfectly embodying the double's doubts about his own identity.
18;The cinematography was spectacular .
19;the battle scenes of course, but also many beautifully constructed scenes near or on the sea as well.
20;Kurosawa's use of traditional Japanese instruments, especially the drum in the final battle scene is awesome, and the costumes and art direction were outstanding.
21;all the rest is great.
22;I'm not good at remembering names, but I remember this movie very well.
23;some people like the drama and the battle scenes, which are top.
24;His last act at the end only makes the charge of the troops even more tragic, but it feels very real .
25;A film of great beauty and rhythm.
26;The turmoil of that era of Japanese history comes through with force and mastery.
27;"Exactly like almost any other Kurosawa movie
28;It is a film filled with emotion, pulling strings with both the delight of a child and a man's sacrifice for another man he never knew.
29;The story is more intriguing and unusual, and the movie asks several of the """"big questions"""" of life: What does it mean to be a leader?"""
30;This is one of my favorite films of all time, it is somewhat long by American standards, but it is very absorbing and beautiful.
31;I consider it a much greater and more subtle achievement than Ran.
32;This is an extremely engaging film.
33;"d battle movie, and I found the characters and story much more engaging and ""human"" than in Ran."
34;The cinematography is also astounding, and acting supurb.
35;The much of the soundtrack actually detracts from the film.
36;The music brought the review from 5 to 4 stars.
37;This is my favorite among Kurosawa's movies and is certainly one of the best movies of all times.
38;Story, photography, actors, all exceed!
39;A feast for the eyes, sufficient to be transported in another world.
40;directed by Kurosawa, the movie is an interesting exploration of expectations and leadership.
41;The color photography is exquisite, and the battle scenes .
42;are awesome: they are so huge in scope (the cast is enormous) and thrilling in execution that they almost wear us out just watching them.
43;but he's the most famous one!
44;but the final battle scene is beautifully heart wrenching.
45;And the Shadow Warrior's conflicting feelings and relationships did touch me.
46;the art direction was stunning.
47;Both films are visually stunning, but there are differences in how the stories are presented.
48;the story of Kagemusha seems more of a natural portrayal in comparison.
49;The loyalty of the thief to the warlord is perhaps a quintessentially Japanese story, and is beautifully evoked in many small scenes throughout the film.
50;They are a part of the amazing beauty of the film's images.
51;One of my favorite images of all the films I have seen is that of the warlord's unhappy son plotting in a traditional room, while in the background we can see the blue of a lake being whipped up by a storm.
52;some people will prefer Ran, and others will like best Kurosawa's earlier and more earthy films, such as Yojimbo.
53;They are all wonderful, but for myself Kagemusha is his crowning achievement.
54;But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4.
55;rate, and the additional material is interesting and well done.
56;star movie, even so, into a 5.
57;"Kagemusha is another excellent film by Kurasawa, though a notch below ""7 Samurai"" and ""Throne of Blood."""
58;"All the characters feel ""real"" ."
59;This film belongs in any serious collector's library.
60;While the overall film is a bit too slow paced to be considered great, there is no doubt that it is an intricate work that abounds with astonishing color imagery, and is suffused in details that the screenplay by Kurosawa and Masato Ide slip in very subtly.
61;the best example of this is that even though the average viewer will know next to nothing of Japanese feudal history (what little I knew came from mostly old Japanese films), specific details are not needed because the themes and characterizations are so universal.
62;It won the Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and was seen as a comeback film for Kurosawa, after a mostly forgettable decade (the 1970s) of sporadic film work.
63;Nakadai is splendid in both roles.
64;all in all, Kagemusha is a very good film, with some great scenes and moments.
65;"Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" is a complicated film, and sometimes difficult to like."
66;Seven Samurai it certainly is not, but it is well worth the effort.
67;this film contains what is, to me, one of the single most beautiful images I've seen in film.
68;the Criterion edition of this film is Kurosawa's original full.
69;"The criminal does a fine job as the ""shadow warrior"" and eventually wins the hearts of Shingen's family, but hubris leads him astray, he is found out, and cast back into the world of peasantry."
70;kagemusha is a film beautiful in parts but unsuccessful as a whole.
71;The sets and filmography are stunning and rich.
72;And the very long film can be watched easily because each scene is enchanting on its own merits.
73;One theme that characters reflect on several times is the challenge of continuously impersonating another person.
74;my impression of Kagemusha is that Kurosawa had several pieces of visual imagery that he wanted to put on film (the dream sequence, the battlefield.)
75;Kurosawa is the master of the visual, using light, color, motion to evoke magic on the screen.
76;The elegant formal language and ritualistic manners are suffused with the essence of traditional Japan.
77;The battle scenes, with large groups of mounted soldiers, were more epic in scope than the clashes between the seven samurai and the little band of outlaws, but the contrapuntal rhythms were similar.
78;incubated film and found an enthusiastic audience in these two American admirers of his work.
79;Those with some knowledge of Japanese history will have an advantage.
80;He takes up a position on the castle ramparts to listen for the flute and is shot by a sniper.
81;There is a precedent for this in that Shingen's brother has acted as his double in the past.
82;But they take this as a jest and react with laughter.
83;The double sits through the battle calmly, inspiring his men to victory.
84;lord Katsunori, now the acknowledged master of the clan, orders an attack.
85;The double wanders onto the scene for a last time and sees the carnage.
86;while Kagemusha may not rank among Kurosawa's greatest films (Rashomon, Throne of Blood, Ikiru, Seven Samurai) this is nonetheless a showcase of the director's genius.
87;Nakadai is a monumental star in his own right.
88;regardless of which actors were chosen, Kagemusha is a must.
89;see for lovers of Japanese cinema.
90;Though it may be difficult to follow at times for American viewers because of the unfamiliar historical references, it is definitely worth the effort.
91;Deeper, unanswered questions such as these rise again and again, albeit in subtle form, interlaced with the film's surreal, beautiful cinematography.
92;a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord.
93;this visually striking film explores the extent to which a person's identity is constructed by others.
94;This was Kurosawa's great leap forward into the world of colour.
95;He started life as a painter, and judging by the many magnificent examples featured in the Extras, a very talented painter too.
96;For 5 years he churned out paintings of scenes he had in mind for Kagemusha, although its gestation period was closer to a full decade.
97;He painted the film first on paper, and then went on to paint it on the camera.
98;In doing so, he created perhaps the greatest true Art Film up to that time.
99;No film that I know contains a greater profusion of beautiful shots and images, both in their composition and their colour, although the same can be said of RAN.
100;It is like touring a Gallery displaying the retrospective exhibition of a great artist.
101;"The characters don't speak
102;Kagemusha's great leap compares with Beethoven's Eroica and Picasso's Les Demoiselles D'Avignon, the ascent to the highest level from which point further advances were simply along a plateau.
103;line and one more familiar to Western audiences through King Lear.
104;over commentary by Stephen Prince is a great help, and I would strongly counsel any first.
105;Contrary to some comments, Prince skilfully draws attention to technical and stylistic elements in the way the film is composed, as well as providing a fascinating historical background and highlighting the subtle interplay between the characters that would escape the unobservant eye.
106;This shows all of the 200 paintings that Kurosawa produced and fits them into their correct place in the narrative, providing a quick summary of the plot.
107;control, the silences and the long takes, all added to the subtlety and psychological power of this film, and I was very happy to do without the hysterics that for me mar some sections of Seven Samurai.
108;This is a technically superb product in every way.
109;The clarity is sharp, except where, as in the burial and dream sequences, Kurosawa deliberately softens the images.
110;The subtitles are detailed and precise.
111;beautifully shot in color, Kagemusha tells the story of the Takeda clan during the civil war period of Japan's feudal era.
112;The head of the clan, Takeda Shingen, was considered the greatest general of his time.
113;His character arc, as it moves from common criminal to eventual warlord and tragic fall is magnificent.
114;blowing as a few other of Akira Kurosawa's films, 'Kagemusha' is still awesome in its vision and scope.
115;Very few directors have or had the creativity of this man.
116;The opening sequence is actually the best part of the movie.
117;Watch carefully, it is all done in one shot!!
118;Here's one example of a film whose power lies firmly in the visual and aesthetic departments.
119;Kagemusha is beautiful beyond belief, filled with cinematic wonder, confident in the sheer force of imagery.
120;Kagemusha benefits from the fact that it doesn't give Nakadai as much incentive to overplay .
121;Kagemusha, thankfully, dwells in the exquisite art designs (Kurosawa Akira took years to draw out the storyboards, having been unable to get the film produced for a long time), perfect compositions, inexhaustible wealth of colours, and sublime lighting.
122;grossing Japanese film of its time and, I would argue, Kurosawa's masterpiece.
123;Definitely one of the best Kurosawa.
124;ray looks fantastic (contrary to some of the reviews I have read) and the audio is very good.
125;This is an incredible film.
126;This is the real thing, however.
127;It also has 20 minutes of additional scenes.
128;Wow, what a movie experience!
129;Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior) is my favorite film from direct Akira Kurosawa, which is saying one heck of a lot when one considers """"Rashomon"""", """"Seven Samurai"""", and """"Ran""""."""
130;I sat riveted to the television screen during the entire presentation.
131;The heart of the film is the inner change and new found strength that progresses through the thief as he learns to become the Warlord.
132;"Awesome in its imagery, ""Kagemusha"" will mesmerize you and move you."
133;Between 1 and 10, this powerful Kurosawa classic gets a 10.
134;The fact that a number of excellent actors worked with Kurosawa and produced splendid performances (e. g. Takashi Shimura in 'Seven Samurai') had nothing to do with Kurosawa, but were more a happy accident.
135;Kagemusha is a great movie, and for my money it is more entertaining than Ran.
136;Kagemusha tells the story in a more straightforward fashion, the acting is less exaggerated, and I think it's just more fun.
137;it is a small point, perhaps.
138;His creative inspirations have resulted in such classics as The Seven Samurai, Red Beard, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ikiru.
139;In a career that included nearly thirty films, Kurosawa became a legend.
140;Kagemusha, or the Shadow Warrior, is a testament to that.
141;After the flood of samurai and martial arts epic films in the 1960's and 70's, movie companies were burnt out on the samurai concept.
142;Signing on as assitant producers, these two brought Kurosawa back into the spotlight, and can be accredited for having laid a foundational hand in helping the director regain enough prestige to soon after create two of his most well.
143;what makes Kagemusha a brilliant film?
144;To begin, the story is phenomenal.
145;"It's entirely philosophical in approach, yet it follows the basic Kurosawa model: ""A good film must be interesting and enjoyable."""
146;Enjoyable it is, as Kurosawa's artistic eye comes out in beautiful display.
147;Many scenes within the film appear to be mirrored creations of those ideas, a still painting come to life.
148;The setting for this dream sequence is in a gigantic model canvas of a painting all in red.
149;This technique was later used in Ran, but in a wholly original style for each of the two films.
150;that's another aspect of Kurosawa's films that make them so enjoyable.
151;The characters are always well developed, the stories themselves original.
152;From the crime thriller Stray Dog to the poignant scenes of Madadayo, Kurosawa always manages to keep a streak of originality in his works.
153;compare Kagemusha's reflection on power to Throne of Blood's.
154;With respects to Kurosawa, however, there was purpose in everything he did.
155;A director as meticulous as The Master, especially in his later years, viewed all of the elements.
156;The same is true with Throne of Blood being Macbeth.)
157;By any standard it is a superb film.
158;I thought so, but remember I am a major Kurosawa fan.
159;"I have always liked the film ""Kagemusha"" ever since I watched it on the big screen."
160;It is one of my favorite Kurosawa films.
161;[And there are plently of his films I admire and have in my collection].
162;The films just an incredible watch, and I did not mind the length while viewing it in the theatre.
163;Many have criticized that the film is too long, not so, it's terrific and every minute of the film is a treat to watch.
164;lord Shingen, wonderfully portrayed by (Tatsuya Nakadi), whose credits include 'RAN', and 'SWORD OF DOOM' to name just two films, does a wonderful portrayal as both Lord Shingen, and his double in the film.
165;He was about to be executed, however, he is given a stay of execution as long as he does what he is told, and gives a performance of Lord Shingen, which everyone will accept.
166;The film is terrific, and the cinematography and set designs are incredible.
167;"The nuances of the film are great, and as I wrote earlier, this is one of my favorite Kurosawa films, along with ""Ikiru."""
168;I highly recommend this magnificent masterpiece of cinema, it is a truly great film and a must see.
169;I actually prefer Kagemusha to Ran.
170;"My Japanese language University teacher used to gripe that Kurosawa represented a ""western"" style of cinema, as opposed to Ozu, for instance."
171;The 1970s film stock retained a fair amount of grain, but it's rendered harmless by the raging colors.
172;The stereo sound is as good as it gets with a foreign film of this age.
173;Kagemusha works on a surface level as a take on illusion and reality, but those wise enough to dig deeper will need Prince's help.
174;"The Japanese director ""always had a great story to tell,"" Lucas adds."
175;this movie had excellent action shots tthroughout.
176;The copy I received from Amazon shows no lack of resolution, and has vibrant colors.
177;the last scene and final shot are breathtaking.
178;This unbeatable Cannes winner film is a notable artistic triumph a real feast for the eyes , the mind and soul .
179;The emotional tribulations and the huge pressure exerted in this double carries to a superb and poetic story teller under the powerful gaze of the superb japanese filmmaker, the dazzling genius : Akira Kurosawa .
180;the arresting images in the final battle are simply outstanding .
181;a timeless monumental masterpiece and one of the giants films in any age .
182;The opening sequence challenges any doubts and skepticism about the subtle yet powerful capabilities for theatre conventions in filmmaking .
183;it is a fascinating long take/meeting of minds and gigantic themes (!)
184;epic in the tradition for realism in the likes of Seven Samurai.
185;Kurosawa opted for this with the most awe.
186;inspiring indulgence in form, contrasting it with a most chilling (mauve) theme about reality.
187;"Kurasawa's ""Seven Samurai"" left lasting memories and I wanted to see more of this great director's work."
188;It is one that I will keep and will watch again from time to time.
189;"There is a fascinating scene where an early ""sniper"" demonstrates an ingenious technique for setting up the fatal shot on which the plot turns."
190;"At times the effect is a bit ""archaic"" and a bit reminiscent of one of the early Russian historic ""epic"" films about a Prince who defeats the Teutonic knights."
191;Still, the film held my interest all by itself, without reference to the history of the cinema.
192;and the final battle scene, when Ikeda's brave army is simply destroyed.
193;Sad, but rich in history, color, drma, etc.
194;Watch it, enjoy it, and you'll never forget this movie.
195;If you're a fan of classic Japanese film, this is a must for your collection.
196;ray rendention is gorgeous, even projected on my 8.
197;If you've never seen this film before, you'll love it's classic Japanese themes, beautiful costumes, epic scenes with thousands of extras, and of course, the fantastic Japanese cinematography that you'd expect.
198;This is good because while Katsu was fabulous as Zatoichi, you just can't picture him playing a feudal lord.
199;But I still enjoyed the movie for all the other Kurosawa features, high winds, heavy rain, panoramic shots, great close.
200;Nakadai is also wonderful in Sword of Doom, Yojimbo, Ran and Kill!
201;I always look for their version if available.
202;check out Ran and Throne of Blood, also pretty good.
203;"Staggering in its scope and power, ""Kagemusha"" features soulful acting, breathtaking visual sequences, and at its heart, a mortal tragedy worthy of Shakespeare."
204;Kurosawa not only tells a whopping good yarn rooted in historic reality, he uses the vulgar, but wrenchingly sympathetic figure of Nakadai's thief to explore questions of identity and the theatrical nature of political power.
205;In addition, Kurosawa's painterly use of color (especially during several large.
206;motion dream sequences are simply unparalleled.
207;"Made with the help of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, ""Kagemusha"" is a somber late masterpiece by one of the world's greatest filmmakers."
208;William Goldman, and American screenwriter, admonished aspiring screenwriters to begin scenes as close to end as possible.
209;This is a magnificent movie.
210;The photography and set design alone are breathtaking.
211;This is more a historical piece than a character study.
212;In one quietly dramatic scene, we see two lines of cavalry come galloping over an incline from a great distance.
213;The thunder of the racing horses builds, and the lines converge before us.
214;In this single shot, not much else happens, but the composition and sound create a powerful effect.
215;This movie is filled with subtle, magnificent moments like this.
216;see for any movie buff.
217;Criterion has done it again!
218;These are perfect for those of us that do not understand Japanese.
219;Order it now, and enjoy it soon.
220;Amazing movie, crazy colors, huge numbers in battle scenes.
221;See seven Samurai and others before taking on this one.
222;This movie is fine, I like it!
223;The film is what it is and other reviewers have done an excellent job in reviewing why this story is worth telling.
224;The graininess is played up by blu.
225;Being a big fan of Asian cinema and Japanese history, I have longed to view Kagemusha.
226;The double has to convince even his close relations that he is the real thing, otherwise word may spread and other clans will take advantage of the situation.
227;this movie is one of Japanese most famous directors, Akira Kurosawa, biggest pieces.
228;You definitely can see the western influences in the magnificent Kurosawa movie, The Seven Samurai.
229;"The movie, very beautifully shot with scenery and provided with intelligent dialogue has been weakened by one thing
230;The acting is superb, characters are amply developed, even though the focus is mainly on 1 person (the double), scenery is spectacular, dialogue is well written, but in the end it just is too long.
231;i viewed the 3/29/05 Criterion Collection: Picture and Sound are yes, above par.
232;ray version would be worth the upgrade.
233;The film is five stars, and the transfer is one.
234;A beautiful film with excellent acting and brilliant directing.
235;The story is a classic, but still interesting, and as always, Kurosawa shows why he is one of the all.
236;Even though historians are not entirely sure on whether Shingen had died from a sniper shot or from illness, this film takes the former theory and moves on to telling another story in Kurosawa's distinctive style.
237;Any director with a huge budget can make a big battle scene, but Kurosawa has a unique gift for making violence look grand and gruesome and yet dramatic and poetic at the same time.
238;Just love the scenes showing the great Oda Nobunaga and his warming to things western like red wine, Catholic missionaries, European armour and a feathered red hat.
239;KAGEMUSHA is the great 1980 drama involving a clan of 16th.
240;provoking film about reality and illusion, as well as a visually inviting work filled with many striking scenes and compositions that Kurosawa films are known for.
241;looking men, an elaborate dream sequence, and a harrowing montage of the aftermath of the final battle are among some of Kurosawa's finest moments in his long film career.
242;Nakadai would also play the lead role in Kurosawa's next film, RAN, 5 years later, again unrecognizably playing a much older man.
243;the best supplement on the disc is Stephen Prince's full.
244;length audio commentary, which, due to the film's length, is able to elaborate on many topics in great details.
245;Much of Prince's narration (I would say half of it) is more on the historical background of the film's period than the filmmaking and art of the film.
246;He also provides a great analysis on Kurosawa's most elaborate dream sequence.
247;prince also does a good job of pointing out the differences between the shortened, 162.
248;min international version and this 180.
249;In a still gallery section called """"A Vision Realized"""", there are about 20 of the paintings placed side by side with still photos from the film."""
250;the booklet also include 3 wonderful essays.
251;One essay deals with the film itself, its art and its history.
252;Another one is a Sight.
253;The third one covers Kurosawa himself biographically.
254;the disc also comes with a well.
255;commercial films, even those by great directors.
256;, as the camera reveals three characters all having the same appearance.
257;Nonetheless, the similarities between them are striking in both their appearance and their lifestyle, but what makes the difference between them is that one of them holds the power of the province in which both live and he intends to use the thief as a body double.
258;Kagemusha offers a wealth of artistic images drawn from paintings that go beyond colors and lines, which compels further introspective contemplating work on self and society.
259;This occurs as Kurosawa ultimately brings together all aspects of himself .
260;It is a treat for the eyes.
261;the film differs from Ran, the director's wonderful version of King Lear, in that it is a drama built around historical records and tradition.
262;I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Samarai films and/or the work of Akira Kurosawa.
263;When Kurosawa made this film he was 70 years old and it stands without question as one of his best films.
264;What makes it so powerful is the portrayal of the perfect fusion of the warrior's emotional intensity with intellectual acuity.
265;Both emotion and intellect are focused solely, in this film, on enemy warlords outwitting each other and that focus is so strong that it more than carries the film through its 2 1/2 hour length.
266;Yet here, in Kagemusha, we see the workings of the minds on both sides, whereas Seven Samurai's power comes from its depiction of how samurais use their intelligence to fight and outwit a completely insubstantial enemy.
267;kagemusha will never be equalled in its portrayal of the intensity of the warrior spirit.
268;Add to that the astounding vision of a filmmaker who knows more than any other how, where, and why a battle scene's power is derived.
269;As well, there is perfect production design, costuming, and set pieces.
270;All of these together make for a film so riveting, so well done, it is impossible to say anything bad about the film.
271;this is a must see for all serious students of film, and for all those who love a great adventure, and for all those who just flat out love movies.
272;The symbolic plots validating honor, courage, and duty of the warriors to their fellows appeal to him greatly at this time in his life.
273;i kept thinking how wonderful it is to listen to the Japanese language.
274;She was only two years older and a new reader herself, but she tried the best she could.
275;but I also remember other languages, interwoven with their own stories, faces and images, and how they sounded to my ear.
276;the comfort and familiar resonance, but also poetry, sadness and suffering that is such an integral part of the Russian language.
277;the dreamy lyricism of Sofia Loren's Italian that seemed to carry the very warmth of its native landscape in its melody.
278;the elegant playfulness of Jean Paul Belmono's French, breaking those entrenched, but tired, bourgeois rules in unexpected and enchanting ways.
279;Japanese language is one of the subjects that he will be taking.
280;I had to watch Kagemusha twice to really appreciate it.
281;The first time I was more obsessed with my computer and missed key parts, the second time I enjoyed it thoroughly.
282;The use of color and photography is amazing and considering how low the budget was, Kurosawa did a very nice job.
283;This is an extraordinary film combining great scenario and incredible visual effects, made by THE great master of Japanese cinema.
284;years old son, avenged the defeat and destroyed completely the Hirada, greatly stregthening the position of his clan.
285;impressed by her beauty Takeda Harunobu took her as a concubine and she gave him his favorite son, Takeda Katsuyori, who is another important character in the film.
286;having completed the conquest of Shinano province and having signed the alliance with the powerful Imagawa daimyo of Suruga, young Harunobu beacame a very famous and powerful warlord .
287;the famous strategist Yamamoto Kansuke and Shingen's loyal younger brother, Takeda Nobushige.
288;you will recognize him by his impressive monastic clothes and the buddhist rosary he always held in hands.
289;Both warlords needed peace because a new power was rising in Japan .
290;in 1560 Oda Nobunaga greatly weakened the powerful Imagawa clan from Suruga by winning the battle of Okehazama.
291;The Takeda clan was now a major power and one of two top pretenders to the control over all Japan.
292;Both Shingen and his double are played by the great Japanese actor Tatsuya Nakadai .
293;and as always, he does a great job.
294;Those are the three generals who at one moment cross their lances together, in an extremely powerful scene towards the end of the film.
295;other than the scenario, which is excellent, as always in Kurosawa films, the great treasure of this film are the images.
296;Samurai armies are impressive, battles are even better and the sequences of the dreams (or rather nightmares) are very powerful.
297;on another hand, the character of Oda Nobunaga is IMPRESSIVELY good!
298;Believe me, it is a good advice.
299;The film is a visual masterpiece, Kurosawa has an equally good eye for epic as well as ordinary moments.
300;It creates a number of creative constraints, while, nevertheless, taking liberties with the historical record.
301;Regardless, it is a great movie, one that, in a number of ways, anticipates Kurosawa's final triumph, the sublime Ran.
302;Fantastic and, overwhelmingly, a Brilliant movie, if you can handle the English subtitles.
303;This (The Criterion Collection) remake version is stunningly beautiful .
304;The Japanese culture and civilization come across well and true to form with even the wardrobe, antics etc. all being intact.
305;The dedication and honor aspects of the story are vital to the direction and sad conclusion of this epic drama.
306;He had been noted for his warm disposition and his equally impressive talents in warfare and administration.
307;this is a fantastic historical piece, with great costumes and sets.
308;The performances are also top.
309;Of course, one of the great features of any Kurosawa flick is his masterful cinematography, and it's abundantly on display here.
310;This film is a treat for the brain and the eye.
311;The kagemusha is almost as convincing as the great lord Takeda Shingen himself.
312;And what a great story it is too.
313;"Yes the story telling style is inimitably Kurosawa, so expect some of the social customs to ""appear"" odd."
314;But even that is yet another aspect of the great theatricality in this movie.
315;The main characters are historically real people, part of the bloody 16th century Japanese history.
316;And technically the storyline follows very closely the actual historical events.
317;The booklet which accompanies the disk has a more detailed account of the historical period, as well as a number of the original drawings, costumes, set art etc (drawn by Kurosawa himself) used in the film.
318;"The ""extras"" are a particularly worthwhile part of the disk."
319;The story of how the film was almost NOT made is as interesting as the story of how the film was made.
320;All I can say is wow!
321;And then say wow again!
322;This is a decent plan, but when the double starts feeling the conflictions of his new self and former the chances diminish.
323;Plus, enemies are ever threatening and questioning the truth, even family connections.
324;sounds exciting, and for three hours it does have many fine moments, which I purport to be well worth the film.
325;Still though, this one as recent and enduring as it is may still reach those yet, as the film is meant to.
326;have the power to move.
327;imprints upon the mind of the viewer Kurosawa's unflinching view of the destiny of human greed.
328;"The print of the film itself could perhaps be a little sharper, but it's no worse than Studio Canal's print for ""Ran"", and the bold coulour schema really shines through."
329;wise, an excellent book, an insightful commentary and a second disc with a Japanese documentary on the master director and extensive interviews with project funders George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola really make this a set worth getting, even in the age of Blu.
330;At last, the full version of this film!
331;great preformences with great effect.
332;the dream sequence is really fantastic.
333;theres alot of great acting and a perfect story.
334;", and I can assure you that this Criterion version will be ""THE BEST"" one."
335;hour movie and 45minits documentary, are bundled in dual.
336;"disc set of ""Seven Samurai"" are great."
337;"Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about ""historical"" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan."
338;A perfect addition to his legacy of classic films.
339;the movie is presented uncut and in its full splendor.
340;"also known in the Western hemisphere as ""The Shadow Warrior"", this is truly an Epic picture with a very beautiful and touching storyline."
341;"unlike ""Throne of Blood"" (adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth) and ""Ran"" (adaptation of King Lear), both also masterpieces, ""Kagemusha"" is an original Japanese story and gives a thorough insight of Japan in the 17th Century."
342;highly recommended and well worth its price.
343;Kagemusha is such a depressing movie, but it's also so good!
344;I've enjoyed everything by Kurosawa and Kagemusha is one of the better films.
345;Of his later colour samurai films, if you had to choose between Ran and Kagemusha, Ran is by far the superior film .
346;still, the extras make this package extra nice.
347;So once again, Criterion delivers an exceptional package!
348;Once again a very nice pic by the same director.
349;i have several of his films and they all are neato!I hope this is at least 20 words.
350;His scenes are perfectly framed and yet, the frames are expansive enough for his performers to do what they meant to do.
351;Fighting scenes are at best patchy but it's still an awe.
352;inspiring site as most of what we have these days are all CGI effects.
353;As war rages on, the scene of soldiers coming to a standstill listening to the haunting sound of a solo flute performance is at once poignant and beautiful at the same time.
354;There are moments like that in Kagemusha.
355;Mind you, this movie would eventually be superseded by Ran, which I feel is his work in maturity particularly for this form of epic war genre.
356;Such an amazing cinematic experience.
357;You become immersed in the time period of the 16th Century.
358;Ironically, the Japanese trailers and teasers are visually crisp.
359;my greatest memory from having seen the VHS version was the final battle scene and the futility of it all.
360;this is a movie in the manner of great epics.
361;The visuals are sweeping, and all of it with real people and horses.
362;To think that the warriors were sent into battle with large flags attached to poles on their backs is amazing, and a visual feast.
363;added: I recently had the chance to re.
364;watch the film, and the commentary, which made it much more enjoyable, as the contrast was made between the full length Japanese version, and the truncated American version.
365;The Criterion edition has the full version.
366;"Nobukado tells his brother: ""I have imperonated you for a long time, but this is incredible."""
367;This is the primary focus of the film.
368;In creating a war epic, an epic that sometimes feels like a history lesson, Kurosawa has also created a study of identity while intertwining religious and philosophical Buddhist overtones.
369;I think that this might be the most solid of them all.
370;For starters, some knowledge of the time period is necessary if one wants a truly compelling and fulfilling experience.
371;"this is a good film
372;There are strong visual similarities on both.
373;The Kagemusha's changing into the lord is compelling to watch, as Nobukado notices the phases the double goes through as he becomes another.
374;Kurosawa raises the interesting and profound question of identity and delves into the issue.
375;The battle scenes are powerful, but Kurosawa would later outdo them in """"Ran."""
376;It is true that the great Mifune is sorely missed, but Nakadai does a fine job carrying both roles in the film.
377;the visuals are among the highlights of the film.
378;Kurosawa stages a lot of his scenes as paintings (the beautifuly frightening dream the double has comes to mind).
379;Technically the film is well done.
380;I would originally give this film 3 stars until the last half hour which contains some of the most powerful footage I have ever scene.
381;The scene in which the double is forced out in the rain is truly heartbreaking to watch.
382;And the final battle scene is simply breathtaking, horrific, and yet beautiful at the same time.
383;Kurosawa manages to paint a world of hell yet do it artistically without glamorizing war.
384;His brother would not let him look away, and Kurosawa manages to convey that personal and intimate feeling to us.
385;And the final image of the dead kagemusha floating past the banner in the lake is just hypnotic.
386;Kurosawa ends the film just at the right moment.
387;Kagemusha has fine performances, an involving story, decent music (at times a little too western.
388;sounding), great photography, interesting characters (Though the script does fall short in certain areas), profound meanings (as all Kurosawa films do), and one hell of a finale.
389;The last half hour boosts this from a good to a great film.
390;I have seen probably a dozen of Kurosawa's movies, and Kagemusha is my favorite of them all.
391;For the wonderful cinematography and score alone, it is deserving of a better format than VHS.
392;OK, I love Japanese film and Kurosawa is my favorite Japanese director, but even a newbie to film will be hooked.
393;I loved every aspect of this film.
394;script, cinematography, acting, score, choreography, sound, and of course .
395;Crystal clear picture and sound, great packaging and graphics, awesome booklet.
396;Included in the special features is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history.
397;great story about a double filling in the shoes of Samurai Warlord Takeda Shingen.
398;Shingen was a brilliant warrior and politican who still is very popular in Japan today.
399;Back to the film, it has pageantry, epic battles, action and drama galore, even if you hate a history lesson, the movie will hold you captive.
400;what makes Prince's commentary so outstanding is his in.
401;The historical events chronicled in the film are well.
402;For example, according to Prince, the wounding by gunfire of Shingen as he listens to an enemy's flute marks a monumental event in Japanese history.
403;screen historical events that were going on the same time as the incidents in the film, giving the listener a much broader understanding of both history and Kurosawa's accomplishment.
404;"After listening to the commentary, I came away with a much deeper appreciation for ""Kagemusha."
405;"Otherwise, ""Kagemusha"" is among Kurosawa's best period films."
406;Those costumes are awesome and the number of extras is like an American film from the late 50's or the early 60's.
407;This movie is my third Akira Kurosawa film : he is a classic director.
408;Actually I viewed it twice, each timemesmerized.
409;I look forward to seeing it again and again.
410;The subtitleswere clarified, honed and perfected, too.
411;rashomon is my favorite film by him but 7 samurai is what I think to be his most complete film.
412;"Kurosawa's beautiful film Kagemusha is a meditation on subjects that have haunted the director throughout his career in cinema: the doppelgager or double, (which brings to question identity and how identity is formed, and where identity is located
413;from The Lower Depths and Stray Dog to Ran, many of his films meditate deeply on human hearts without hope).
414;His identity, so involved in the creation of film, in making his meditations and dreams communicated through the medium of film, and the life that grew up around the creation.
415;the friendships, the experiences, the world of making that makes a world.
416;That really would be impertinent, and an insult to a life dedicated to the highest good an artist can achieve: an honest look at human experience with the intent of understanding the mysteries of the human heart.
417;If you don't know Kurosawa and hesitate to approach foreign language cinema, know this: he is a God to Steven Speielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and John Milius among others.
418;His films are a unique combination of epic storytelling and heartbreaking empathy, and Kagemusha is one of his grandest spectacles, all in bewitching color.
419;Perhaps, but worth every last penny.
420;One reviewer says this is due to cutting of important war scenes from this Lucas.
421;Was this written by a high.
422;All the high ratings probably come from a film class at some school that is obsessed with Kurosawa's work.
423;This is for someone who has an interest in Japanese culture and views storyline and character development as most important elements in the movie.
424;I loved """"Seven Samurai"""" and """"Yojimbo"""" and expected """"Kagemusha"""" to be another cool Samurai flick with action and subtle humor."""
425;But this Masterpiece made me have a closer look upon Akira Kurosawa, and I found a whole line of exceptional Films.
426;After experiencing Kagemusha, I wanted to see all the other great films made by Kurosawa, one of the best movie makers ever.
427;To prevent the fall of his house, he commands his most loyal man to keep his dead a secret for three years.
428;To make the plan work, a perfect looking Double, a commoner, a thief, is taking over the representative role in public.
429;More and more, he learn about loyality and respect.
430;He finds joy again in existence and becomes more and more the body, he should be the shadow of.
431;all in all, this is not only a great story, a great visual joy, but also a momentum of japanese society and military, and a melancholic view of mans nature.
432;if you can stand three hours of good movie, this one is for you.
433;After seeing some of Kurosawa's early film classics I had high expectations for this later color film.
434;To my surprise, the film turns out to be one of his best!
435;The gorgeous cinematography and its striking approach to detail and composition place it in my list of greatest films.
436;Criterion has done a great job .
437;well worth the price of admission.
438;The film also sparked some interest in me in the history of Japan and the life of Shignen.
439;"kagemusha or ""Impostor"" literally ""Shadow Warrior"" is Akira Kurosawa's third color film and one of his more impressive of the later releases."
440;the film is very impressive and has some excellent sets.
441;The costumes are very authentic also.
442;the release is a double disc box set with some very nice special features.
443;disc 2 contains an interview with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola where they discuss their role in helping produce the film.
444;the ending battle scene may have been historically accurate but instead Kurosawa should have awarded his viewers with some nice hand to hand combat between Samurai.
445;It needed more action to go with it!On a positive note, the Cinematography is excellent and probably the best I've seen in any Kurosawa movie.
446;Possibly the best in any movie period.
447;It's rich in color and history.
448;the acting was also very well done and so was the costume design.
449;Because of the amazing resemblence with him, Shingen turns the thief into his kagemusha or shadow warrior training him to take his place in case of death for no less than three years.
450;As the story progresses we see the double grow and mature, gaining corage to accomplish his role as best he can.
451;The soundtrack spetacularly give the movie an epic,and heroic feel this being seen on the final scene.
452;Kurosawa showed in this film, despite the slow ritm and the lack of great battles, all his talent as a master of his art.
453;I remember Kagemusha as one of Akira Kurosawa's best movies, in my opinion, second only to Throne of Blood.
454;I was awaiting the delivery ofthe Criterion edition of this movie with great excitement.
455;one can only hope that one day Kagemusha will be issued in a complete version, so we can watch this movie in all it's splendour, and the way Kurosawa wanted it to be.
456;Helped by a unforgetable performance by Tatsuya Nakadai, a dazzling use of color, and Kurosawa's camera floating above all the deceit and mayhem like an angry God, Kagemusha is a film for the ages and a blueprint of what action films can be.
457;"very Good"" condition and within two."
458;The wish is fulfilled, with unforeseeable results.
459;A fantastic exploration of the ephemeral nature of power.
460;this version is the one on which George Lucas and Coppola share a credit for executive producer of the international version .
461;amazon: please make more Kurosawa movies available!
462;As always Kurosawa made something more beyond than any other directors.
463;This one deserves this remaster by Criterion and I'm happy to see that.
464;I highly recommend this as its very valuable and have a point of view the way you never see before.
465;His land is prosperous and doing well.
466;a staggering and stunnning epic Kurosawa's film benefits from the fact that he painted and sketched out many of the major scenes for the film over a four year period while he waited for financing for this major project.
467;"There's a fine audio commentary by Stephen Prince author of ""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa""."
468;Prince has some very interesting insights into Kurosawa's world and that of Japanese cinema.
469;The subtitles are much improved and easier to read as well.
470;There's also a 48 page book featuring paintings, sketches and an interview with Kurosawa around the time of this film's release from SIGHT and SOUND magazine.
471;the second disc features a number of great extras.
472;There's a brand new interview with Goerge Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola discussing how they got involved in financing Kurosawa's epic film.
473;There's also a wonderful supplement that runs about 45 minutes using Kurosawa's original paintings, sketches and drawings reconstructing much of the film showing how closely the final film matched his original paintings.
474;overall a first rate presentation from Criterion and well worth the investment.
475;Nobody could interpret Shakesphere as well as Kurosawa.
476;All of Kurosawa's films are beautiful and all feature fantastic actors, but to me this was the most interesting.
477;in was one of Kurosawa's best idiosyncratic, oddball characters, and the tragedy of the story was substantial.
478;I liked this much more than Ran
479;When I receive this item I am sure I will appreciate it.
480;As I trust Criterion and I have read good things about the film.
481;an excellent transfer and crisp, spare sound draw you into the melancholy world of Kagemusha.
482;But his use of color, sound and character are heart.
483;the background material puts you right into the darkened mind of Kurosawa when he created the film.
484;The extra content also helps you understand and appreciate what can be a difficult film at times.
485;i own several of the other Criterion Kurosawa editions and this is as good or better than anything to date.
486;I am just discovering the works of Kurisawa and this is one of the most(if not the most) interesting Kurisawa pictures.
487;the performance by Nadaki is simply amazing, it was great how he changed for each role as the time went on.
488;the battle scenes are great.
489;This image is as powerful as some of the later in his powerhouse RAN.
490;A definite must own if you are a Kurisawa fan or want a ride for the imagination.
491;Every aspect of this film is flawless.
