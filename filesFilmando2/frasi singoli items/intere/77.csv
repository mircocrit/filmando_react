1;This is a great movie about people caught up in, and overwhelmed, by the forces of history but still, somehow, able to find their way.
2;Kusturica's hilarious and poignant masterpiece recounts the recent tragic history of Yugoslavia in vivid detail.
3;It's a provocative take on a little understood part of the world.
4;loving animals, we are just hungry for party's, tuba music and just having fun.
5;I think that Emir Kusturica is a genius, and you will understand why when you see this movie.
6;And yes, that band makes some pretty great noise.
7;If anything, I suspect that the greatest loss to the movie probably is made up of surreal sequences that would help to add consistency to the surprisingly explicit (in narrative terms) and thought provoking ending.
8;The answer is given in very specific terms, but the movie will take you for a dark, musical ride along the way.
9;this movie starts out as a rollicking comedy and then turns into a poignant tradgedy.
10;but i found it on amazon.
11;it's just as good as he described it.
12;The film is not just a masterpiece from the artistic point of view, it is strikingly profound in its interpretation of the history of Yugoslavia up to these days.
13;One can better appreciate the film if one has a thorough understanding of the history of Tito's and Milosevic's Yugoslavias, as well as of the historical differences among the Croats, the Serbs and Muslims.
14;Definitely, this is a masterpiece and a must for those who love serious cinema.
15;Although I never got this movie, Underground is a unique and strange movie experience.
16;It has great energy, and ends well.
17;So I can see part of Underground's appeal.
18;And I've seen movies about the region I liked much better, especially Beautiful People by Jasmin Dizdar, and also No Man's Land by Danis Tanovic.
19;It is clear that many people really love Underground: perhaps they really love quirky movies, or have a deeper knowledge or better perspective of the former Yugoslavia.
20;My last words of advice: beware of any film Cannes praises!
21;Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Podzemlje (Underground) represents the rise and disintegration of Yugoslavia through magical realism.
22;This boisterousness and joie de vivre, one of the charms of Balkan countries, returns many times throughout the film.
23;A whole generation grows up in the cellar, while outside Tito rules a peaceful Yugoslavia.
24;Nonetheless, what comes next is the most poignant part of all.
25;And the ending is skillfully done, touching upon ancient themes of European folklore and providing true and inspiring closure after all of the story's violence.
26;Goran Bregovic's soundtrack for the film has a permanent place on my iPod and that of half of my friends.
27;Nonetheless, it is an excellent production, which will stay with those viewers who got it long after its close.
28;realistic fable of perhaps 50 years in the history of Yugoslavia, beginning during WWII.
29;even a touch of magic now and then.
30;i love the pure extravagance of this film.
31;An elephant steals a pair of shoes from an open, 2nd story window.
32;stage while his lover is performing, ties her on his back, and carries her away.
33;It's all from the creative brains of the writer/director/cinematographer team.
34;just take a ride on the back of this film and try to catch your breath!
35;There are Serbs, Croats, Muslim Bosnians, and others, but some of them have pieces of all of them.
36;I hope that in real life all those nice characters come together at the end in a big party celebrating life, and that's when the tragedy of Yugoslavia will end.
37;After some months I came to see the shorter cinema version.
38;it is a masterpiece of Kusturica's surrealism, just remember the scene after the first nazi bombing of Belgrade, when animals of the zoo run freely on the streets.
39;Remember the electric shocks, the making of the war movie.
40;Most of the scenes are just perfect as well as the scenario.
41;bregovic, the maker of the music for this movie, has created something far greater than he had expected.
42;By now, the music theme is extremely popular in Serbia and can be heard everywhere on Belgrade's streets performed by little gipsy groups.
43;It is the most important movie to come out of the Balkans and represents a landmark in European film history.
44;Simply said, it is perfect.
45;I think some sections of this film are very funny and some sections comment very poignantly on events of the last 50 years.
46;Its a parable in some parts, an all out comedy in other parts and a satire in still other parts.
47;By making its lead characters a kind of slapstick act, a black comedy team to be more precise, the film is driven by a gusto and verve which laughs in the face of history.
48;the comedy team splits up.
49;The final scenes deal with some recent history that has yet to be digested fully, however, and I'm not certain the film even knows exactly whats its saying in those final scenes.
50;Exploitation by deceiving Machiavellian politicians is an ever going event in the world and no better illustration made than in Underground
51;I am from Belgrade Yugoslavia, so this movie has special impact on me.
52;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to find out more about history of this great country of ours.
53;It is as close to perfect as celluloid life gets.
54;An amazing and fantastic story.
55;kusturica continues his creative journey with an updated subject (the dissolution of the yugoslav state) while still employing the same magic.
56;postponed end leaves the viewer on a good balance.
57;I find International movies difficult because of all the reading but most satisfying and worth the effort when they are really good.
58;I felt that after enduring this fairly silly movie for over an hour it did not matter if the rest of the movie suddenly got better.
59;I was generous giving it two stars.
60;Kusturica won The cannes Festival in 1995 defeating a superior film as Ulysses gaze .
61;and in this sense he builds a solid fortress in the underground of his own house , privating of any possible escape .
62;The arresting script of Kusturica is finely variegated with intelligent and smart vignettes who reminds us to Fellini .
63;a great film that together with Time of gypsies are the alpha and omega of this talented film maker .
64;Is really great , how Emir Kusturica describes the serbian culture , and they morals .
65;Yes what's in the film is in the real life , how they talk , and how they do things , is exactly like in the film !
66;All the humor , the MUSIc , and everything is great !
67;It's one of my best films !
68;Lots of symbols and imagery and philosophical dialgoue.
69;I wouldn't quite call it a fantasy, but it has that feel of magical realism.
70;I recommend it, whether you know about the region or not, because it has so many layers to it.
71;The metaphors and similies in this movie equal any in any poem or a novel.
72;95) It is amazing how this movie manages to offer images and idealogy to represent the social changes in the society as well as mental changes in the people of the region.
73;Get it, you will be pleasantly surpised.
74;layered and intelligent under a veneer of sheer mindlessness you get entertained at the rate of thrill a minute and then you might like to see it again to marvel at the story narration, screenplay and characterization.
75;Kusturica has manufactured an epic allegory that is robust, moving, and quite surreal, especially with his phenomenal Fellini.
76;Acclaimed for its technical virtuosity and brilliant critique of war's absurdity, Underground is a sprawling, brutally funny epic about romance, betrayal, and the anguish of modern life.
77;My girlfriend glowingly recommended this film.
78;There is a difference between a good movie and a good story.
79;Few movies actually are able to combine both throughout the duration.
80;This movie fits in with the best of them all.
81;Tragic things happen in this movie but yet it is funny.
82;This movie makes you smile but tears come out of your eyes and your heart sinks.
83;The more I think about this movie the more I realise how great it is.
84;This is entertainment at its peak, the ultimate.
85;lets see what other great movie summed up the history of a country.
86;I am so happy it has finally been released in the US.
87;I absolutley wept and also roared with laughter with this transedescent picture of Yugoslavia.
88;Maybe it's more poignant knowing the history and culture, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
89;Absurd, political, funny, witty, heart.
90;I have never seen anything quite as brilliant, inventive, extraordinary as UNDERGROUND .
91;One of the most amazing films I've seen
92;The music is magnificent, the acting is amazing and the story is totally mind.
93;We laughed and cried the whole way through.
94;This is the finest film to come out of Serbia.
95;The film sweeps viewers into a satyrical and sometimes hypnotic world of emotions.
96;Out of the collaboration of three ingenious artists, Dusan Kovacevic, the great writer of comedy, Emir Kusturica, a master of the absurd in film.
97;making, and Goran Bregovic, the most wonderful musician alive, arose Underground , the most ambitious, most daring, and perhaps simply the best motion picture of the nineties.
98;Kusturica is a supreme magical realist of cinema
99;The novel is a brilliant allegory of fifty years in Yugoslav history (1941.1992), written in a multitude of styles, from fairy tale, to comic sketch, to classic tragedy.
100;The scope of the story is enormous, and even Kusturica seems to have some trouble pulling it off, especially towards the end, as the film tends to get out of hand and become rather hard to follow.
101;Nevertheless, on the whole Kusturica's telling of the story is successful.
102;His wonderful direction is only enhanced by the superb cast, hilarious and mad as it is.
103;The film also features a phenomenal soundtrack by the forementioned Bregovic.
104;This is a movie everyone should certainly see, though in all honesty it is only the peoples of Yugoslavia who can truly appreciate it.
105;In fact, the movie is dedicated to those few lost generations who lived through the period in question.
106;Spellbinding, moving , comic and tragic at the same time, this movie portraits in a amazingly focussed manner the chaos that is Yugoslavia.
107;its beauties, virtues, its paradoxes, treacheries, its people full of life.
108;(the music by Goran Bregovic is a treat by itself).
109;Emir Kusturica weaves a poignant, comic, vicious, madcap, sprawling, and physics defying cinematic experience deftly intertwined with the history of Yugoslavia and its successor states.
110;That is the chilling part of the film, and this I feel is the crux of his message.
111;Miki Manojlovic is my personal favorite portraying the alcoholic womanizing and eventually fiercely loyal husband.
112;The chemistry between him and his best friend (Lazar Ristovski) is exceptional as is the love triangle with Mirjana Jokovic (an amazing actress).
113;my favorite element of Emir Kusturica's films is his use of magical realism.
114;Emir is the master of using the technique, for example, the glorious Underground wedding scene with the bride connected to the wheeled wooden arm.
115;The scenes are madcap, the music exceptional and infectious and inches further and further into your skull as you watch edging you on to some conclusion, either you love or despise the movie.
116;The movie is also heart wrenching while being astoundingly funny, the dichotomy is paramount to his message.
117;It explores the joys of family, of love, and the terror of events and feelings (war, lust) that seem out of and individual's control.
118;This film is one of the most profound things I've ever seen.
119;It is tragic, hunorous, touching, thought.
120;It has a surreal, fiercely imagined landscape of oddball characters who struggle against themselves and the horrors of their country.
121;It raises many deep questions about the human condition and about human behavior.
122;It's not the greatest film ever made, and I won't conjecture what is, but it's amongst the greatest I've seen (and yes, I have seen a fair few in my time).
123;some people call it appreciation of art and artistry, but never mind all that.
124;This film is truly a masterpiece.
125;It is a remarkable statement about the insanity of the Balkan wars, and war in general.
126;Further, it is funny, touching, and extremely memorable.
127;I don't want to give too much away (some reviews really do too much of that), but, this is truly an 'essential film of the 1990s'.
128;Further, Goran Bregovic's soundtrack is spectacular.
129;There are so many memorable songs, such as Mesecina and Kalashnikov that will be running through your head years after you've seen the movie.
130;As always, Kusturica combines surrealism with reality to tell a story of profound implications.
131;I would recommend you to take a look at the history of the former Yugoslavia to understand all the symbols Kusturica uses in the movie.
132;I think that it could have been an excellent comedy, because as long as it is a comedy, it is very funny!
133;love towards one's country, war, holy fools, saving stray monkeys, life of simple people .
134;Makes you wonder how masterpieces like this get swept under the rug.
135;Great humorous take on the history of Yugoslavia.
136;Hilarious lead characters Marko and Blackie.
137;this is an amazing movie which covers several decades.
138;a highly recommended masterpiece by emir kusterica!
139;If you can read a text on a symbolic level this movie will teach you the history of Yugoslavia.
140;there is amazing brawling in this movie.
141;It was actually edited down from a miniseries I believe.
142;i recommend it for sure!
143;This film is filled with so much energy and joy that no audience can come out of it unmoved.
144;And isn't that what counts: to see a picture that makes you think what you just saw instead of just going mindless out of the cinema?The story is perfect mix of tragedy, comedy, romance,hate.
145;Underneith it tells the story of heroes,glorification of heroes, war criminals.
146;It's not often i get swept away by a film but this film really managed to capture what the film medium can do.
147;A mix of bitter sweet story, that changes emotions and attitude throughout the filmAs original as two Coen brothers films combined and as moving as anything you will ever see.
148;Perhaps the best film of this decade.
