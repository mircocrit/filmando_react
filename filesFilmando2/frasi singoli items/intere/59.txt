I:77;1;Technology allows for many things these days and IF a company is going to toot their horn and say something is restored.
I:77;2;especially a high roller like Universal.
I:77;3;not great, but definitely liveable (remember when it was just cool to get this on a disc?lol:.)
I:77;4;I noticed this with DRACULA as well, that the 90's releases (poster art covers) SEEMED to have better sound than the LEGACY versions.
I:77;5;oVERALL PART 2: This releases is cool.
I:77;6;but still gets a 50/50 for what we get packaged up.
I:77;7;Will the servant pick the right brain for Dr. Henry Frankenstein?
I:77;8;Frankenstein discovered a new ray that gives life!
I:77;9;The storm will generate enough electricity to power the experiment.
I:77;10;The teacher warns Henry about what can happen.
I:77;11;Meanwhile the preparations for the marriage creates happiness in the village.
I:77;12;There seems to be a happy ending for the Frankensteins.
I:77;13;"They discuss the novel ""Frankenstein"", and Mary continues the story after the death of Frankenstein and his monster."
I:77;14;Dr. Pretorius arrives at night to see Henry with important news about his creations.
I:77;15;He has created tiny humans from seeds (trick photography).
I:77;16;Can they produce a brave new world of manufactured beings?
I:77;17;The villagers gather to capture the monster alive, and chain him in the old dungeon.
I:77;18;A rising storm will provide the electric power to raise the dead.
I:77;19;Started it as an introduction to reading the book in one of my classes to compare book with film.
I:77;20;For being a rather old film, I enjoyed watching it.
I:77;21;It wasn't like the book, but that was fine with me.
I:77;22;It wasn't very scary, but it was still enjoyable.
I:77;23;"Karloff was the original Frankenstein Monster (save for a couple of mostly forgotten silent films from other studios earlier)and is the best actor to ever play the monster
I:77;24;Also, Colin Clive as the mentally anguished Dr. Frankenstein gives a great performance .
I:77;25;The rest of the cast is solid too, including notable performances from a couple of other stalwarts from horror films of the '30s, Dwight Frye (as Fritz, the mad hunchback assistant) and Edward Van Sloan (as Frankenstein's mentor, Dr. Waldman).
I:77;26;The Great James Whale directed this movie, as well as a few other classic horror movies from the early 1930s (The Invisible Man, Bride of Frankenstein, The Old Dark House).
I:77;27;white monster flicks go, the original 'Frankenstein' is still pretty tough to beat.
I:77;28;Seeing it again recently was a real pleasure.
I:77;29;Required viewing for cultural literacy, IMO, James Whale's film is not true to Shelley's masterpiece, but it is a seminal film that spawned multitudes of works.
I:77;30;One of those great Monster movies that captures everything, including the human depth (even in moments where it isn't intended), `Frankenstein' lives on, literally, as one of the greatest films in this genre.
I:77;31;james Whale (famed director) created a masterpiece when he constructed this brilliant fright.
I:77;32;The film truly carries with it the feel of horror, with the mood primed and ready for terror.
I:77;33;"The stormy nights, the creepy castle, the dark and sinister performances (Clive truly shows how genius corrupts the mind)
I:77;34;for me, this is an iconic performance.
I:77;35;There are few performances that will go on to be remembered forever, instantly recognizable.
I:77;36;The performance, behind all that makeup, is very impressive.
I:77;37;It may not look like much on the outset, but there are surprising touches that make this a very astute performance.
I:77;38;"The way that Karloff plays off his character's brute strength while maintaining a layer of fear (he is like a caged and mistreated animal) is outstanding, and that moment with the little girl, by the water, the playfulness and childlike curiosity
I:77;39;I made a few arguments when reviewing `King Kong' a while back, about how Peter Jackson's remake brought new layers of life to the original.
I:77;40;What is great about `Frankenstein' is that it needs to remake to expound upon the issues presented.
I:77;41;the obvious one is that of aspiring to be godlike and the damage that power can bring to the mind, but the moment in the film that I found MOST chilling was the `happy ending' that was, surprisingly, an afterthought.
I:77;42;The happy ending, for me, is the best route this film could have gone, because unwittingly almost they have added yet another layer of harsh realism to the film.
I:77;43;Boris Karloff was brilliant as the monster.
I:77;44;This film is the epitome of old fashion feature films.
I:77;45;The film's atmosphere, scenes, sets, and characters are incredible and believable despite the time period.
I:77;46;I would recommend this movie to all who are horror movie fans.
I:77;47;Any advice is greatly appreciated.
I:77;48;I enjoyed it more this time.
I:77;49;Being a black and white movie helps give a eerie feeling.
I:77;50;And, the scene with the little girl is terrific.
I:77;51;One of the great horror films of all time, but I must admit that it's possible to see once too often.
I:77;52;Actually, I thought Victor was Dr. Frankenstein's first name, But it's Henry.
I:77;53;Victor is the friend who is to be best man at Henry and Elizabeth's wedding.
I:77;54;He wanted to create life.
I:77;55;Her father carries her through the middle of the happy throng celebrating Henry and Elizabeth's upcoming wedding, and quiets the crowd as they realize he's carrying his dead daughter.
I:77;56;The movie was a huge money maker and guaranteed Karloff's career.
I:77;57;Also, it is entertaining, especially if you like horror films.
I:77;58;It's nice to have the Universal Monsters on Blu.
I:77;59;ray separately, This one is one of the best!
I:77;60;It also has some great insights by other filmmakers on how this film influenced them, I enjoyed it very much!
I:77;61;"Though I love most ""classics"" ."
I:77;62;I mean, if you look at a shot of the place from afar, you see a lighthouse on top of a high hill.
I:77;63;I did have a good time making fun of the ridiculous dialog though.
I:77;64;They did enjoy ripping the movie apart compared to the novel.
I:77;65;great story, not completely over the top acting, some realism, and some 30's Germania.
I:77;66;It was also great seeing the pre.
I:77;67;Reminds me of my grand dad.
I:77;68;another great movie for you video library.
I:77;69;Now that you've watched Gods and Monsters, go back and watch the original classics that spawned the legend of its main character and director.
I:77;70;Boris Karloff gives a beautifully tragic performance as the creature created by a mad scientist who is intent on taking over God's position as creator.
I:77;71;Countless plot details from Mary Shelley's novel are ignored, but director James Whale's feel for comedy among all the horror is priceless, as is the delightfully crazy production design (mad scientists' labs were forever classified as places with bubbling test tubes and flashing lights because of this film).
I:77;72;There is a good cast here(Clive as the tormented Dr.,Sloan as his mentor, who again as he did in other films of the genre, says We must destroy it!
I:77;73;John Boles, beautiful Mae Clarke, and of course Karloff).
I:77;74;Frankenstein is no longer frightening, but it remains impressive, and its story of a scientist who dared to imitate God is as timely as ever.
I:77;75;Kenneth Strickfaden's striking laboratory sets are still a sight to behold, and were used again in Mel Brooks' send.
I:77;76;but it is the performances that really transcend time.
I:77;77;Best of all is Karloff in his star.
I:77;78;"one of the most important and influential films in cinema history, ""Frankenstein"" is essential viewing."
I:77;79;it is Boris Karloff's indisputably iconic and singularly haunting performance as the child.
I:77;80;like brute, misunderstood and despised by all, who's only longing and desire is to be loved and cared for by others that continues to be one of cinema's timeless jewels of acting perfection, dramatic magnitude, and note.
I:77;81;Karloff's monster, like Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates or Robert De Norio's Travis Bickle, is one of cinema's fortunate accidents of how the exact casting of just the right perfect someone can unbelievably bolster the film.
I:77;82;old gothic horror film to continue to be copiously admired, internationally beloved, and enthusiastically cherished up to contemporary times.
I:77;83;frankenstein retains numerous stellar elements including a magnificently captivating early sound ensemble cast including Edward Van Sloan (Doctor Waldman), Mae Clarke (Elizabeth), Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein), Dwight Frye (Fritz), and the unforgettable Colin Clive, the archetypal mad scientist, (Henry Frankenstein), brilliantly provocative Frankenstein make.
I:77;84;up genius Jack Pierce, manically splendid and cleverly articulated German Expressionistic sets ,that place this tale in an indescribable alternate Grimm Fairy Tale reminiscent landscape, James Whales immeasurably eloquent moral consolidation and inventively multi.
I:77;85;Despite these blemishes, Frankenstein consummately embodies the finest narrative qualities of the early Universal monster films, contains the simply greatest incarnation of Frankenstein's monster, and stubbornly remains both in ambiance and creative evocativeness the finest film version of the Mary Shelly story.
I:77;86;of documentary, film historian Rudy Behlmer's consistently stellar illuminating time.
I:77;87;universally (pun intended) recommended to anyone interested in film classics, the Universal Monster films, or the everlasting time repelling landmark films of the 1930's.
I:77;88;Much better than any of the Frankenstein movie's of more recent vintage.
I:77;89;Karlof steals the show as the misunderstood monster who only wants to be accepted by people.
I:77;90;His experiments are a success, but the being that rises from his slab is an abomination of science.
I:77;91;The 1931 version would set the standard for every Gothic Horror film to follow, with its incredible sets, creeping atmosphere, and impeccable performances.
I:77;92;"Colin Clive shows a ferocious energy and an irresponsible enthusiasm as he declares ""It's alive!"""
I:77;93;The iconic look of the creature would be attributed to the great Jack Pierce, who would go on to design other such notable villains as The Mummy and The Wolf Man.
I:77;94;While his towering form combined with his menacing snarls made The Monster both fearsome and frightening, it is the tender moments like the death of Maria that best demonstrate Karloff's range and form as an actor.
I:77;95;fRANKENSTEIN is the greatest of any of Universal's classic monster movies, and yet James Whales would somehow manage to outdo himself four years later in the film's stunning sequel.
I:77;96;Frankenstein is a classic, which means that a lot of us haven't sat through it, start to finish, but feel as though we have.
I:77;97;"And sometimes when we do finally sit down and watch a ""classic,"" we're kind of left wondering."
I:77;98;The movie is an atmospheric masterpiece.
I:77;99;Frankenstein is in love with his creation.
I:77;100;Karloff's brilliant body work that captures the pain and beauty of the creature, and the inclusion of the scene in which the monster is happily playing seem insufficient as an indictment of Henry's treatment of his creation, of the ambition that robbed him of his humanity.
I:77;101;"Technically, it is a brilliant film
I:77;102;"And it is a classic, too, in that it preserves for us a time when monsters were monsters, and deserved to die
I:77;103;A classic movie that i'd never seen before until a friend suggested i watch it.
I:77;104;on the other hand it is a beautiful film to look at and it`s set design and some camera movements as well as Clive`s mad Dr. frankenstein and Karloff's creature are certainly an eye.
I:77;105;filler for fans of vintage movies as well as for classic horror.
I:77;106;Especially the art direction in which Whale was very much involved, represents one of the finest moments in Hollywood`s era of Germanic.
I:77;107;As for the performances the film is quite mixed.
I:77;108;the movie itself is a classic and is awesome.
I:77;109;especially for those like myself who love movies and collect them.
I:77;110;is this film likable ?
I:77;111;this most certainly is an odd film.
I:77;112;Frankenstein and The Monster are one thing Justice is most certainly another.
I:77;113;in 1931 dollars and cents the return is absolutely excellent.
I:77;114;that is the unknown,It is the source of the hysteria and it is as well the very identity as to Monster,The Field of Electricity.
I:77;115;Both Karloff and Whale can be accredited for the film's status as enduring classic.
I:77;116;the greatest stars of Frankenstein were Boris Karloff, Jack Pierce, and Kenneth Strickfaden.
I:77;117;Jack Pierce created the brilliant makeup for the Frankenstein Monster as well as most of the other classic Universal monsters and Kenneth Strickfaden created the electrical apparatuses seen in the iconic scene where Frankenstein creates the monster in his laboratory.
I:77;118;Frankenstein sends Fritz to a university to steal the brain of a genius, which will be given to Frankenstein's creation.
I:77;119;He insists that they stay and witness his grand achievement.
I:77;120;: A Short Film, Universal Horror feature.
I:77;121;A great classic beautifully restored.
I:77;122;With Frankenstein you can earn your status as a classy movie viewer.
I:77;123;It is one of the rare films in this genre to cross the border seamlessly into popular mainstream culture.
I:77;124;In the movie, the story is that of the monster first and foremost, and his creator is portrayed as a genius who conducted his experiments in some sort of lunatic phase.
I:77;125;"the movie actually begins with a dapper fellow warning audience members that what they are about to see may shock and horrify them
I:77;126;Colin Clive is terrific as young Dr. Frankenstein, particularly in the scene in which the monster is brought to life before the horrified eyes of the doctor's fianc e, mentor, and friend.
I:77;127;"Boris Karloff is fantastic as well, even though all he has to do is stumble around and make growling noises every so often
I:77;128;I found him to be delightful and hilarious, complaining much of the time about his son's behavior and the bother of being the most important man in the village.
I:77;129;His trip to his son's laboratory, particularly his climb up the staircase, is extremely funny.
I:77;130;Those unfamiliar with Shelley's novel probably enjoy Frankenstein more than I do.
I:77;131;Yet I would argue that these qualities are what make these films unique and give them a dream.
I:77;132;there is something magical about pre.
I:77;133;Code movies tend to be slicker, polished, glamorous and more cautious in the their content.
I:77;134;His growls are enough to still send shivers up your spine.
I:77;135;making and still scary stuff after 3/4 of a century!
I:77;136;up job of all time, Boris Karloff managed to give such a distinctive performance that it made a star of him.
I:77;137;His monster remains touching even today.
I:77;138;Wonderful classic Frankenstein, with Karloff as the monster.
I:77;139;Strays a long way off the original novel by Shelley, but still fun to watch.
I:77;140;My students loved the film.
I:77;141;This is a classic picture.
I:77;142;Boris Karloff gave one of the best performances of his career here.
I:77;143;Mary Shelley's book is mainly one of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is captured perfectly here, with Frankenstein's mood from optimism, to horror, to desperation, and finally resignation reflected in the haunted features of Colin Clive.
I:77;144;The Creature's experiences take him along the same path of emotions as experienced by Frankenstein himself, from optimism to resignation, and to convey those emotions under so much make.
I:77;145;The sets are beautiful, from the silhouetted hilltop scenes, ancient castles, and of course the laboratory.
I:77;146;The lab set was designed so beautifully for black and white (as the lovingly made spoof version in Young Frankenstein evidences) and is every young boy's dream chemistry set and electrical lab.
I:77;147;I find it quite refreshing not to have sentimental music during the scene with the little girl, nor dramatic horns and strings during the final scenes.
I:77;148;mastered well with a clear print highlighting the excellent contrasts achieved by clever set design and lighting.
I:77;149;An essential part of any movie buff's collection.
I:77;150;I thought the blind man interaction with the monster was very important to movie.
I:77;151;I loved this movie when I was a kid.
I:77;152;This movie is a classic!
I:77;153;If you like gothic horror at its best, this is one for you.
I:77;154;Just like the old films of horror add it to the Best.
I:77;155;Mr. Karloff in this one he is the best .
I:77;156;Besides the gothis settings and atmosphere, we get the definitive mad doctor, hunchbacked assistant and the most incredible monster to ever grace the silver screen played to uncanny perfection by Boris Karloff.
I:77;157;karloff's brilliant performance really catapults this film beyond it's brisk pace and short length.
I:77;158;first the sets are amazing and though an early talkie, there are lots of great sound effects from the laboratory machines and thunder.
I:77;159;"If ever a film deserved the phrase ""they just don't make em' like they used to"" Frankenstein is surely it."
I:77;160;This is quite a feat for a film that is only 70 minutes long and made in a few months.
I:77;161;Karloff's performance in particular is one of the greatest of all time.
I:77;162;behind the fantastic set pieces we have James Whales who directs and Jack Pierce who created the classic monster's makeup and all of Universal's iconic monsters.
I:77;163;Forget that this may not be what Mary Shelley intended the monster to look like, this makeup is fantastic and is instantly recognizable.
I:77;164;absolutely and so is the film, one of the greatest films ever made regardless of genre, but certainly the crown jewel of gothic horror films.
I:77;165;reading a friend of mine's review once again I was reminded how important the addition of the obviously add on happy ending turned out to be.
I:77;166;A lucky stroke of pure genius because it shows how little regard for the monsters life people have.
I:77;167;the Blu Ray looks amazing with deep blacks and a clarity that has never been seen before, the sound?
I:77;168;it's as crisp and clear as you can expect from a film that is 80 plus years old.
I:77;169;This is the real deal of monster films.
I:77;170;It was sooooo funny and my family and I always watched this and it has with it a lot of fond family memories connected to it also.
I:77;171;Because this means either you need to keep your VHS tapes and player or the original uncut version of Frankenstein will be forever LOST!
I:77;172;I take after my brother with appreciation for classic horror.
I:77;173;The classic monsters are the best.
I:77;174;They come and go quickly but the classics endure.
I:77;175;take the classic horror movies and you have creativitiy and the subtle spine tingling fear of the unknown.
I:77;176;I highly recommend collecting the series from this classic day in film history.
I:77;177;but the depiction is brilliant.
I:77;178;Frankenstein, seeking power over life and death, is brilliantly acted, and captures the essence of the theme within the boundaries of early 1930s filmography and sound.
I:77;179;An all time classic movie based on the original Frankenstein book by Mary Shelly.
I:77;180;The acting is superb, the plot believable, and the creature scary for a film made in 1931.
I:77;181;Very believable, exciting and scary, at the same time.
I:77;182;The American Film Institute (AFI) voted it into the top 100 films in the first 100 years of film (1998).
I:77;183;universal gathered the movie genius' and embarked on adapting Mary Shelly's novel to the screen.
I:77;184;up master Jack Pierce to create the giant Frankenstein Monster (played by Boris Karloff).
I:77;185;People were genuinely scared, horrified but curious to see this film.
I:77;186;Fritz steals a brain from the local medical school.
I:77;187;Through lightning storms, electrical shocks and unbelievable special effects brings the Monster to life!
I:77;188;This collection is the very best of their horror movies completely digitally remastered and uncensored.
I:77;189;With lots of special features, photos and narratives.
I:77;190;is a delight, including numerous interviews with various historians, critics, and Karloff's daughter.
I:77;191;The bonus audio track by Rudy Behlmer is also quite interesting, as are the various biographies and notes, and although the short film BOO is a spurious mix of footage from NOSFERATU, DRACULA, THE CAT AND THE CANARY, and FRANKENSTEIN, it is an enjoyable little throw.
I:77;192;as for the film itself, the production of FRANKENSTEIN was prompted by the incredible success of the earlier DRACULA.
I:77;193;Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale, who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War I. and who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.
I:77;194;"Colin Clive was a difficult actor, but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance
I:77;195;karloff would play the monster again in two later films, one of them directed by Whale, but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right, this is the original combination of talents and the original vision.
I:77;196;Truly a national treasure, to be enjoyed over and over again.
I:77;197;Always great to watch around Hallowe'en and with the kids late at night with pizza or nachos.
I:77;198;No horror film has the power or ability to capture one's fragile attention and send chills as this masterpiece does.
I:77;199;Boris Karloff is in top form as the cinema's most misunderstood monster with stunning makeup effects that have yet to be equaled.
I:77;200;Watch for the famous lake scene with the little girl, a scene known to create shock in 1930's audiences and still packs a whollop to this day.
I:77;201;One of the best classic horror flicks ever made.
I:77;202;I've always enjoyed the old movies, and my grandsons wanted to see this one.
I:77;203;It will be nice to have in my collection.
I:77;204;up after all these years, but it speaks to the ubiquitousness of the 1931 classic in our popular culture that I even had to ask myself whether I'd ever seen FRANKENSTEIN in its entirety.
I:77;205;growing up in the 60s, you almost certainly had to have seen at least aware of the cultural impact of FRANKENSTEIN.
I:77;206;"And somewhere along the line you were going to catch a clip of Colin Clive yelling with demented glee, ""It's alive!"
I:77;207;But he had undeniable screen presence here.
I:77;208;The most intriguing aspect of the monster, as conceived by James Whale and embodied by Karloff, is his NON.
I:77;209;He is, simply put, a child in an adult monster's body.
I:77;210;Pretty prescient, considering it anticipated a debate that's been raging in this country since the mid.60s. muddle notwithstanding though, this is great stuff.
I:77;211;There are plenty of very legit reasons why FRANKENSTEIN isconsidered a classic: the look of the film being but one of them.
I:77;212;ray has nice picture and sound plus neatextras.
I:77;213;I recommend this good Blu.
I:77;214;ray of this monster classic.
I:77;215;Love Boris kaloff a must have a great universal legacy series love all of the movies he is it.
I:77;216;Cove case is very nice looking
I:77;217;This the second of Universals horror cycle after the previous success of Dracula the studio hit the jackpot with their adaption of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein and is the closest to the novel not in storyline but in what the novel says.
I:77;218;James Whale made his mark with this film and it is far superior to Dracula makes one wonder what Whale could have made of Dracula had he been signed as director instead of silent filmaker Tod Browning.
I:77;219;This film is only surpassed by its excellent sequel Bride but its influence is still felt today.
I:77;220;It launched the great Boris Karloff and James Whale and will remain the classic interpretation of the gothic chiller.
I:77;221;How do I critique one of the Classics, everything was great, the shadows, the lighting effects, props, background, all added to the most frightening film of it's time.
I:77;222;Frankenstein created a new icon of terror and a star out of character actor Boris Karloff.
I:77;223;wHALE HAD THE AID OF A GREAT TEAM:Whale found excellent collaborators.
I:77;224;Herman Rosse famous for his set designs created the other.
I:77;225;"the fundamental inside the dramatic structure is the great influence that wisely Whale took borrowed from the German Expressionism
I:77;226;"on the other hand you must remind the obligated reference to The Cabinet of Dr. caligari
I:77;227;I have loved this movie since i was a kid and today at 51 yrs old.
I:77;228;One of the first and, arguably, the finest of the sound Expressionist classics, FRANKENSTEIN owes as much to its star as to its director: Boris Karloff evokes pathos as the put.
I:77;229;upon patchwork pariah, and even Jack Peirce's fantastic, horrifying makeup can't hide the heart that beats within the breast of this undying monster.
I:77;230;I have always considered this a dramatic fantasy/science fiction movie.
I:77;231;troubled man guided this film and gave us a classic of film.
I:77;232;This is a great film that still holds the audience's attention.
I:77;233;a great addition to early horror collections.
I:77;234;Universal had previously released two nice special editions of this film masterpiece,and mine for more gold from there beloved monster.
I:77;235;"special Features are many,and there are the same ones from the previous release and than some.You have the excellent documentary on the film,hosted by David J. skal,the commentary by historian,Rudy Behlmer and the short subject,""Boo!"""
I:77;236;new additions include ANOTHER commentary track by Christopher Frayling,which is enjoyable and enlightening,as well as a documentary on Boris Karloff,that benefits from having access to Universal Studio's film library.
I:77;237;it's very entertaining,and a nice addition to the set.
I:77;238;The film itself is one of the 100 most essential motion pictures ever made.
I:77;239;a gothic masterpiece that was the culmination of the previous decade's fascination with expressionsim,this was the ultimate tale of shadows and the dark that Germany never made.
I:77;240;whale's direction was just right,providing a good pace and peppering with a liveliness that makes Tod Browning's work on Dracula(1931) pale in comparsion.
I:77;241;the performances are top notch.
I:77;242;mae Clark gives a very modern bielevable performance as Henry's distraught fiance and Frederick Kerr makes a wonderful cantankerous,Baron Frankenstein.
I:77;243;of course,it's Karloff who stands above all the performers in a towering portrayal that ranks among the most poignant and moving in cinema history.
I:77;244;karloff gets alot of mileage out of the brilliant make up design by legendary Make Up Artist,Jack Pierce.
I:77;245;an absolutely mesmerizing experience worth returning to again and again,no Horror film has ever really duplicated the power brought on by this gothic masterpiece.
I:77;246;still,one of the great films that belong in every film fan's collection.
I:77;247;this is a lovely edition for the life long fan and the newcomer that has yet to experience the magic of this timeless classic.
I:77;248;and a good film is worth repeating.
I:77;249;I can honestly say that, even after going as far as making a side by side comparison between the first release and this new edition, this new anniversary edition is the one to own.
I:77;250;As far as audio is concerned, it is good and loud, somewhat hissy, but not distractingly so.
I:77;251;Extra special features also worth while.
I:77;252;This new edition finally fives this classic the digital treatment it deserves and proves that even after 75 years, Frankenstein is still a fascinating landmark in early American horror cinema.
I:77;253;This version of Frankenstein with Boris Karloff is an absolute classic.
I:77;254;It is among the finest films produced within the horror genre.
I:77;255;It is interesting to note that this film was released during the years of the Great Depression when so many Americans were out of work and starving on the streets.
I:77;256;boris Karloff, the actor who portrayed the monster of Frankenstein, was also an interesting individual in his own right.
I:77;257;Karloff's success in this film was not only in the make up he wore, but also in being able to provide a truly poignant performance which has thoroughly connected with not only the audience's fears but also their sympathies toward those who are rejected outsiders.
I:77;258;Boris Karloff's excellent acting skills were further borne out in many other films which were made in subsequent years.
I:77;259;He was truly deserving of the recognition of being called one of the horror genre's finest.
I:77;260;The novel further has the laboratory being somewhat shabby and ordinary looking in appearance, whereas, in the movie, it is huge and distinctive with a clear Germanic gothic style.
I:77;261;Despite these differences, Frankenstein the movie was a joy to watch and to remember.
I:77;262;The monster's appearance which was created by makeup genius Jack Pierce was truly incredible and one which has been burned into the collective memory of many thousands of movie goers.
I:77;263;The other performers in the film also did splendid work.
I:77;264;Dwight Frye was excellent as the clearly lunatic and hunchbacked Fritz (many viewers mistakenly thought the name of this character was Igor).
I:77;265;finally, we must recognize that this film was ultimately the great work of a great movie director, James Whale.
I:77;266;He has created a style and ensured that the movie would be moving along at a quick pace.
I:77;267;Director Whale was clearly the key to making all the elements in this film click together and create a movie which to this day remains recognizable for viewers of all ages!
I:77;268;This is truly an awesome classic which well deserves to be listed among the 20th century's 100 finest films by the American Film Institute.
I:77;269;I personally enjoyed the new 75th Anniversary edition because of film and the Bonus features which include: A Tribute to the film career of Boris Karloff, Monster Tracks which are interactive pop.
I:77;270;, and finally a great documentary which highlights the classic horror genre movies made by Universal Studio.
I:77;271;All of these special features were a real pleasure and makes the viewing of this film a memorable event.
I:77;272;my respond: Dr. Henry Frankenstein steals a body, remake it and brought it back as Frankenstein.
I:77;273;it's good for it was adapted from Shelley's original story.
I:77;274;This is a great movie, but if you are looking for the best screen adaptation, this is not the movie for you.
I:77;275;boris Karloff's performance is well worth the time (a little over an hour actually) to watch this movie.
I:77;276;It is an enjoyable film.
I:77;277;Although not the first movie adapted from the book, it is the best known.
I:77;278;Frankenstein succeeds on both of these counts.
I:77;279;the acting in the movie is excellent.
I:77;280;Colin Clive does a masterful job as Dr. Frankenstein, while Dwight Frye is excellent as Fritz.
I:77;281;The scenework, such as the shots of Dr. Frankenstein's castle and the final scene at the windmill are captivating as well.
I:77;282;I highly recommend this movie along with other classic horror movies of this time period.
I:77;283;This original 1931 classic has seen several releases over the past twenty something years.
I:77;284;"And now we have the 75th Anniversary version with even better picture and sound as well as many of the extras included on previous versions with the addition of the wonderful feature documentary ""Universal Horror."""
I:77;285;understood, our opinions, our actions etc.
I:77;286;This classic horror flick is like a re.
I:77;287;understood and very, very sensitive again.
I:77;288;The monster's appearence is amazing.
I:77;289;I've always enjoyed this version of Frankenstein, mostly due to Boris Karloff's look and portrayal of the creature.
I:77;290;This presentation also is the uncut version of the film, and a couple of those reinstated scenes are the only portions of the film that don't look pristine.
I:77;291;There is one peculiarity, however.
I:77;292;the remainder of the disc is rounded out by the requisite filmographies, a fine documentary (The Frankenstein Files) and an oddity entitled Boo!
I:77;293;It's a comedic short that consists of a narrator cracking.
I:77;294;Maybe it was funny in its day.
I:77;295;The documentary is pretty nice, however.
I:77;296;While it sometimes covers the same territory as the commentary, it offers insights into the creature's makeup (courtesy of Rick Baker) and interesting bits about casting and the rest of the production (courtesy of Behlmer and other historians).
I:77;297;a better appreciation for a classic film.
I:77;298;A brilliant doctor and his demented assistant wait for the finale of a landmark scientific experiment.
I:77;299;Finally, it reaches it's peak.
I:77;300;Slowly, the right hand of the shape starts to move.
I:77;301;The doctor is the first to notice and exclaims, It's moving, it's alive, it's moving, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive!
I:77;302;So begins the life of one of filmdom's most durable and often imitated characters.
I:77;303;But it is with Boris Karloff's performance of the misunderstood creature, that the story truly begins.
I:77;304;And what a performance it is.
I:77;305;Surely one of the 10 or 20 most fascinating performances in the history of celluloid, Karloff gives the character and indeed the film in general it's immortality.
I:77;306;He alternates with great lucidity between rage, fear, confusion and even a brief moment of happiness.
I:77;307;And he manages to nail his performance at every turn.
I:77;308;And when Karloff's creation holds out his hands in a great example of film mime, wordlessly asking for understanding, even the hardest heart has to feel for the character's situation.
I:77;309;Mr. Karloff is quite simply the best thing about the film.
I:77;310;the other performances are quite good, namely Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein and Dwight Frye (so successful previously as Renfield in DRACULA) as Fritz, the hunchbacked assistant.
I:77;311;His star still ranks very high in the make.
I:77;312;And the originality of the look of the creature is the second best thing about this movie.
I:77;313;Whale had earned his wings and gained valuable film experience.
I:77;314;That plus the overall story and irresistable Whale humor, in this reviewer's opinon, make BRIDE.
I:77;315;the greatest monster movie of all time and definitely superior to the original.
I:77;316;up, mention must be made of three specific scenes that stand out as among the most memorable, oft.
I:77;317;Karloff's first entrance, BACKING and slowly turning to face front is one of the greatest first appearances in all of cinema.
I:77;318;And there's a fascinating documentary.
I:77;319;The print has been restored beautifully.
I:77;320;It's a wonderful way to watch this legendary movie.
I:77;321;so if you love the classic Universal monsters, you're collection won't be complete without this 1931 highly original classic.
I:77;322;Even if you're not, you must watch the film and marvel at one of the most brilliant film performances of all time from the great Boris Karloff!
I:77;323;especially in the famous scene with a young girl (Marilyn Harris) picking a flower for him.
I:77;324;Herman Rosse's fabulous sets and Whale's meticulous handling of atmosphere and the monster's appearance elevate this eerie study of alienation and scientific hubris far above the campier creature features that followed.
I:77;325;Universal's reissue of this monster classic brings horror fans more background information on the making of the movie, and rare interviews with its cast.
I:77;326;"The new documentary ""Karloff: The Gentle Monster"" pays tribute to the actor whose forty year screen career was made by this monster."
I:77;327;see for serious Frankenphiles, and a title worthy of revisiting.
I:77;328;Old school movie done with just the right ingredients!
I:77;329;This is how they used to make good movies.
I:77;330;"this movie with Dracula made Universal a horror house in the 30s/40s/early 50s as both created a franchise called ""Universal Monsters"" which both films are landmark films in horror cinema."
I:77;331;Director James Whale gives us a moody and atmospheric adaptation of Mary Shelly's classic novel, this mix of sci.
I:77;332;The film co. stars Edward Von Sloan and Lionel Barrymore as the acting in this movie is superb, the film oozes with gothic chills and thrills with plenty of excitement.
I:77;333;"There are memorable moments like the misunderstood creature with the little girl to the line ""It's Alive ALIVE!"""
I:77;334;The film shocked audiences in theaters even with gasps and screams as that in the beginning of the film that a person with a weak heart should leave the theater if the film is upsetting them, it worked like a charm as the film over the years has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and audiences alike making it one of the most beloved horror films of all time.
I:77;335;"It was followed by a dozen sequels with ""Bride of Frankenstein"" being a TRULY worthy sequel and one of the greatest sequels of all time."
I:77;336;This video Frankenstein is in Black and White has the introduction I wanted and the movie on VHS.
I:77;337;The video print is pristine and the sound, updated to 5.1, is incredible.
I:77;338;"The makeup is brilliantly conceived by Universal Studios' ""monster."
I:77;339;Mr. Karloff himself added a final, frightful touch: Coats of wax were applied to Boris' eyelids to make it appear as though Death was desperately trying to close those eyes again, without sucess.
I:77;340;Yet the creature itself has a fragile humanity that both frightens and draws us to him sympathetically all at once.
I:77;341;Karloff's Frankenstein role works because his physical presence is immediately recognized as quite human.
I:77;342;Yet it is, by turns, both highly vulnerable and very dangerous.
I:77;343;Boris plays the role emotionally for all that it is worth, without overdo.
I:77;344;Today, the genius of Mr. Karloff, master of so many genres, is universally recognized.
I:77;345;"Better yet, viewing ""Frankenstein 75th"" on any digital TV shocks me."
I:77;346;Not just for Mr. Karloff's brilliant work, but it's amazing how well a black and white flick of that generation cleans up.
I:77;347;This might be the best Frankenstein movie ever made.
I:77;348;The Wolfman is my favorite.
I:77;349;The acting in Frankenstein is good, especially by Karloff.
I:77;350;Frankenstein is a classic, intelligently done.
I:77;351;as far as scares go it might have been scary at the time but just the movie itself regardless is a work of art.
I:77;352;years into the sound era, continues to find its way into the American Film Institute's Top 100 films list and is continually called one of the best horror films ever made.
I:77;353;"the film opens with the warning
I:77;354;His goal is to create a living, breathing human from these spare parts, which he eventually, of course, does.
I:77;355;of course, I have to mention one of the film's most legendary scenes in which the Monster encounters a young girl who accepts him and hands him some flowers which she demonstrates will float when thrown into the lake.
I:77;356;This scene is beautifully shot and the lack of musical score makes it even more haunting.
I:77;357;the film has beautiful art direction, even in the darkest, gloomiest sets.
I:77;358;Also contributing to the timelessness of the film is the ominous photography, especially effective in the opening scenes with Henry Frankenstein and Fritz.
I:77;359;the performances are worthy of mention, as well.
I:77;360;"when he screams ""it's alive!"
I:77;361;you can really feel the sense of accomplishment pulsating from the brain of a madman.
I:77;362;It's this terrific performance that provided the archetype for the overall look and generally accepted image of the Monster.
I:77;363;it is widely considered a great performance and for a good reason.
I:77;364;known characters in film history, Karloff gives this character tremendous sympathy.
I:77;365;but please enjoy Boris Karloff, possibly the most overlooked and underrated actor in film history presenting a masterful performance worthy of study and celebration.
I:77;366;Karloff's creation is simply one of the finest performances ever captured on film.
I:77;367;It is one of the two or three great performances never nominated for the Oscar.
I:77;368;What Karloff is able to do with just the simplest of gesture or roll of the eye is what acting is all about: telling a truthful, electrifying and emotional story.
I:77;369;If you real Shelly's original work you are likely to be appalled by some of the changes.
I:77;370;while the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein surprised with its effectiveness and advanced film techniques Frankenstein surprises with its brevity and staginess.
I:77;371;But in its defense it is a classic and Boris Karloff is great as the monster.
I:77;372;This is a great movie even after all these years.
I:77;373;He's actually quite gentle to the little girl and really only responds poorly to people when hunted down or threatened.
I:77;374;Boris Karloff in particular took it seriously and did a terrific job.
I:77;375;I recommend this seller to anyone who has interest in their products.
I:77;376;I love the original black and white movies and this is a great addition to my collection.
I:77;377;I'm not a reviewer type o' guy, but I think that a good word on this one is appropriate.
I:77;378;Therefore, regardless of age, the film still provides a tremendous cinematic experience.
I:77;379;Even though this film varies drastically from its source material (Frankenstein (Book, 1818)) it still manages to be both frightening and entertaining.
I:77;380;So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion).
I:77;381;So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.
I:77;382;when it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles.
I:77;383;Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well.
I:77;384;Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film.
I:77;385;He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster.
I:77;386;So overall there is some great acting here.
I:77;387;all of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster.
I:77;388;In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake.
I:77;389;Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.
I:77;390;I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time.
I:77;391;It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster.
I:77;392;Boris Karloff is outstanding as the monster is this original classic monster movie.
I:77;393;Still a pleasure to watch, and even better with this 75th anniversary edition.
I:77;394;James Whale's masterpiece FRANKENSTEIN is one of the most amazing films ever made.
I:77;395;It is a poignant portrait of humanity, a deep, knowing story written from a literary genius and is commonly regarded as the best monster movie ever.
I:77;396;Boris Karloff infuses his finest role with both wonder and anguish.
I:77;397;He paints a terrifying picture of his character.
I:77;398;That is only one of the many moral issues brought up in this movie.
I:77;399;this really doesn't resemble Shelley's work at all but that's OK since the movie is so good.
I:77;400;It was especially ground breaking in it's day and is still amazing.
I:77;401;The best moment in the whole movie would have to be when Frankenstein and his creation lock eyes through the spinning wheel in the windmill.
I:77;402;The main reason for getting the 75th Anniversary edition was the new special features.
I:77;403;I'm very pleased with the film and the special features.
I:77;404;At least I was now able to watch one of the special features that was on the Legacy set.
I:77;405;Still trying to find one of those double.
I:77;406;sided discs that works right.
I:77;407;My Son and I Both enjoyed this movie.
I:77;408;He stated he liked it when it 'Spooked' him out and got scared.
I:77;409;Karloff's monster is brilliantly infused with dignity, an innate innocence and a true non.
I:77;410;i saw James Whale's Frankenstein many years ago, when I was a teenager, and appreciated it then as a classic film.
I:77;411;Having viewed it again through the eyes of an adult with a bit more age, experience and knowledge, I am moved .
I:77;412;That performance is testiment to Karloff's towering talent for character interpretation and a credit to James Whale's directorial abilities.
I:77;413;"I remember watching this movie for the first time as a kid and being scared to death for weeks afterwards!Revisiting this classic movie as an adult, I still feel that Boris Karloff is the best actor in this ""Frankenstein"" classic movie, whereas the rest of the cast of actors (with the exception of Dwight Frye who played Fritz, Dr. Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant) aren't that great in their roles in this movie!The make."
I:77;414;"up for Karloff's character in ""Frankenstein"" was fabulously done and the set design and camera work for the time were excellent too."
I:77;415;"Of course you'll create a so called ""monster"" by doing this!"
I:77;416;Interesting topic of nature verses nurture comes to mind when watching this movie.
I:77;417;"Then, in the ""oh by the way"" category, we have the fact that in these two films Boris Karloff turns in the greatest performance as a monster in movie history (also one of the most moving)."
I:77;418;"although I am in the camp that maintains ""Bride"" is the better of the two and the best Frankenstein movie ever made, the original is a close second and both are absolute classics."
I:77;419;"Side Two has ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) and its trailer, Stephen Sommers the director of ""Van Helsing"" discussing on ""Universal's Classic Monster: Frankenstein's Monster,"" ""She's Alive!"
I:77;420;"Technically, ""House of Dracula"" is the last of the Universal Frankenstein films, but it in the Dracula Legacy Collection, thereby proving that Frankenstein is the greatest movie monster of them all."
I:77;421;The presentation is the same for the Dracula, Wolf Man, Mummy, Invisible Man, and Creature from the Black Lagoon Legacy Collections, but the Frankenstein set is the best of the bunch.
I:77;422;This movie is such a classic!
I:77;423;A must see for any true Frankenstein fan!
I:77;424;City Lights was a humorous Charlie Chaplin silent, and Frankenstein was a full.
I:77;425;frankenstein is based on the classic Mary Shelley novel which combines a number of powerful themes.
I:77;426;Instead, there are a wealth of fairly complex threads weaving through this.
I:77;427;He does his best to lumber around and follow commands, but is tormented by the assistant.
I:77;428;There is a great deal of power and pathos in the acting, in how he tries his best and life just does not treat him well.
I:77;429;He was a promising student but nobody understood his lofty goals.
I:77;430;So many lines of dialogue here are now classics, embedded into our modern culture.
I:77;431;it's funny how cultural expectations can change over time, though.
I:77;432;Every time I see the scene of the father leaving his tiny child all alone at the house .
I:77;433;interestingly, although written by a woman, the movie is definitely a story that focuses on men.
I:77;434;We have the brilliant single.
I:77;435;His best friend who thinks it is OK to try to seduce away his wife.
I:77;436;The wise professor who worries about his student.
I:77;437;watch category, to see where strong drama movies came from, right as talking films were bursting onto the scene.
I:77;438;This must have been a quite exciting time period to live in!Highly recommended.
I:77;439;Frankenstein still thrills audiences of all ages.
I:77;440;This is a must watch.
I:77;441;We also enjoyed the extra information provided by the anniversary edition.
I:77;442;Another of my childhood favorite monsters .
I:77;443;"In all honesty I enjoyed the movie for the classic it was
I:77;444;In A&C you got the Wolfman and Dracula thrown in as well!
I:77;445;Finding this Frankenstein was a great plus for my husband.
I:77;446;He has been wanting it for a long time and it just happened to be the right price.
I:77;447;It made my husband very happy to watch it, thank you so much.
I:77;448;ball the packaging, yet that is precisely what they did.
I:77;449;Funny, the two have nothing to do with one another.
I:77;450;the Good: First, the print looks and sounds better than the previous releases.
I:77;451;Nice and clean with deep blacks, good contrast, and very little damage, the video is solid and a pleasure to watch.
I:77;452;it sounds terrific for the first time (at least in my opinion).
I:77;453;a treasure trove of juicy extras are included, the jewel in the crown being Kevin Brownlow's Universal Horror, which I've caught on TCM.
I:77;454;Also to be found are Karloff: The Gentle Monster, Monster Tracks (informative pop.
I:77;455;"ups that appear throughout the feature
I:77;456;cute short (that presages Fractured Flickers) called Boo!
I:77;457;I was pretty much able to align them up for re.
I:77;458;Biopsy revealed a blob of silicone adhesive.
I:77;459;touches such as this mark the distinction between a good marketing effort and a great one.
I:77;460;Fans wanting the best print available need this one, otherwise the previously linked Legacy Collection, which includes all of the titles in the series, represents good value.
I:77;461;Far from being the early raw, naive horrorfest that others have seen in it here, in fact the movie shows great finesse, sophistication, and creativity at almost every turn.
I:77;462;the actors all turn in outstandingly nuanced performances (of course Karloff's would become the sine qua non of such roles for decades), the mood inspiring cinematography and backdrops are appropriately and overwhelmingly dark and creepy, the sets (especially the lab in the tower) are spectacular, the electrical machinery and special effects during the storm are impressive even by modern standards, and the suspense and the action gripping and spine tingling.
I:77;463;this is truly a classy blast from the past that has lost nothing to all the later reprisals with their bigger budgets and more sophisticated and advanced special effects.
I:77;464;Frankenstein remains a pioneering classic that still stands head and shoulders above the competition.
I:77;465;For me, since first viewing as a kid, this 1931 version of Frankenstein maintains an allure, not scary anymore but so entertaining.
I:77;466;colin Clive and Boris Karloff are wonderful to behold in their roles.
I:77;467;this is a move that is truly classic!
I:77;468;Frankenstein has been remade so many times, but this is still the best.
I:77;469;My entire family STILL watch and it's now 2014, so that's OVER 81 years!!
I:77;470;Great movie,lots of scary moments, and watch it in the dark!!!!
I:77;471;This movie is one of the great classics and I had to have it.
I:77;472;"I found it totally intersting to see how the ""big"" movie studios worked back then, and being a 'Monster' fan since I was a child, it was great to see all of my favorites together in one place and hear how popular they were and how they were made."
I:77;473;When you couple the questions and topics this film brought out with the stellar performances given by Karloff, Colin Clive, Dwight Frye and the rest of the cast, you end up with a film for the ages.
I:77;474;Frankenstein stands as one of the greatest horror movies of all time today, and it will still be standing tall a hundred years from now.
I:77;475;As an adult, I viewed the movie and had to laugh considering all the changes made from Mary Shelley's orginal novel.
I:77;476;I saw this moving when about six years old and it scared the pants off me!
I:77;477;It was one of the first and still one of the best ever made.
I:77;478;Jack Pierce provides the best make.
I:77;479;See the uncut version if you can.
I:77;480;This is one of the greatest monster films to what Universal could do.
I:77;481;If a Frankenstein lover would love this classic film, this is definitely the greatest monster film to every Halloween lover.
I:77;482;I recommend to every monster lover!
I:77;483;Boris Karloff does a great job as the Monster.
I:77;484;Henry's best friend, Victor Moritz, tries to help her.
I:77;485;The trio arrives at the old watch tower just moments before Dr. Frankenstein is to make the greatest experiment of his life.
I:77;486;When the Monster realizes what he has done and leaves.
I:77;487;If you are a fan of the Universal Horror\Monster movies, then this is for you.
I:77;488;This movie classic was the best for its time.
I:77;489;boris Korloff, was the greatest movie monster of all time.
I:77;490;James Whale was a genius.
I:77;491;Indeed, Karloff's sympathetic yet horrifying performance alone makes this film worth watching (again and again!)
I:77;492;, but add to it the gothic sets and Whale's interesting direction, and you have that nearly perfect spine.
I:77;493;chilling mood for which all horror aficionados search.
I:77;494;(One of Whale's best films, he actually outdoes himself in the sequel, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.)
I:77;495;Nothing like it before or since with singular performances by Colin Clive and Boris Karloff and a great supporting cast with James Whale's perfect direction.
I:77;496;but this is still the best.
I:77;497;Frankenstein is an excellent example of how film in the early 1930s was still used as a visual art form, as in the silent films of the previous decades.
I:77;498;colin Clive lays down a terrific performance as Henry Frankenstein, the mad, foolish but passionate scientist who longs to create pure life but succeeds only in creating a monster.
I:77;499;a haunting, slightly disturbing film with some quaint, well timed frights.
I:77;500;It has a distinct style suggestive of early German silent films, such as Nosferatu and the Cabinet of DR Galigari, because of its harsh compositions created with striking sets, intense lighting, strong makeup and greater dramatic acting, altogether making this a first.
I:77;501;This is the second of the classics restored by Universal in their monster collection and it is a gem of course.
I:77;502;The best thing here is Boris Karloff, as Dr. Frankenstein's creation.
I:77;503;And Karloff is masterful in this performance.
I:77;504;troubled actor Colin Clive is also excellent as Frankenstein.
I:77;505;Great sets, especially the flowing electricity in the laboratory, excellent acting and a timeless story overcome any shortcomings.
I:77;506;"While perhaps not quite as sharp as ""Dracula"" the film is as good as its ever been."
I:77;507;The original photography is well represented with little to complain about in terms of flicker, specks, and other video crud.
I:77;508;More eloquent viewers than I have reviewed this classic, but I'll gladly put my two cents in as well.
I:77;509;if you have not seen this movie, please treat yourself and give it a try.
I:77;510;All of the actors do an excellent job.
I:77;511;Colin Clive as the brilliant Dr. Frankenstein, who allows his knowledge and creativity to carry him too far.
I:77;512;And last but most certainly not least, the great Boris Karloff as the monster.
I:77;513;His is one of the greatest non.
I:77;514;Yet he is able to convey a wide range of emotion through body posture, hand gestures, and though his facial expressions were limited due to heavy makeup, he manages it anyway.
I:77;515;It has always been my opinion that Boris Karloff should have won an Oscar for his performance as Frankenstein's monster.
I:77;516;One of the greatest horror movies ever made!
I:77;517;Clive,Frye and Sloan give brilliant performances, but it is Karloff's genius performance that has kept this movie in the top 100 all time greatest films for eternity!
I:77;518;It is just a marvelous performance!
I:77;519;I wanted my 500th review to be special, so I reviewed a film that changed my life!
I:77;520;These r a return to my past, I enjoy them immensely .
I:77;521;A great movie and vhs,it played perfectly,and the price was very reasonable.
I:77;522;i'm glad I got this movie from amazon.
I:77;523;the sound is excellent,it plays like brand new!!!!!
I:77;524;Setting is great with the darkness of the movie.
I:77;525;To see Dr. Frankenstein start to loose control of himself and what he is doing is good story writing.
I:77;526;James Whales' direction is fantastic, and Karloff gives a stand.
I:77;527;Boris Karloff does an outstanding job as the monster!
I:77;528;Much better than any of the other Frankenstein movies!
I:77;529;The next best one would be Bride of Frankenstein .
I:77;530;great version of the classic film.
I:77;531;its an upgraded version with better picture and sound.
I:77;532;plus there are LOTS of goodies as well as cut scenes added to this version.
I:77;533;frankentstein is one of those films thats timeless.
I:77;534;the Bonus features included with this film are great and are very informative i watched them even before i checked out the print of the film.
I:77;535;the documentary on boris karloff is also worth watching.
I:77;536;same with the universal Horror documentary.
I:77;537;great film that undercuts itself at almost every turn.
I:77;538;When the novel by Mary Shelley was adapted to film, it met with great success.
I:77;539;there's really no need to retell the whole story, as it's clearly a well known one that has imprinted its memory in the minds of numerous generations.
I:77;540;Karloff did an admirable job bringing an undead character to life, and Pierce's makeup work was astonishing, particularly for that day and age.
I:77;541;even if this film no longer frightens or disturbs, it's still intriguing, fascinating, and full of moral lessons that will always ring uncomfortably true.
I:77;542;The atmosphere is dark and surrealistic, filled with rich cinematography, gothic styled imagery, and painted with shadows and depth.
I:77;543;Director James Whale was creative with his foreshadowing and subtle camera moves.
I:77;544;"Boris Karloff as the intimidating monster is an ideal choice
I:77;545;He may as well have been born for the part.
I:77;546;When he has the manic and obsessed glee in his eye, it's easy to feel his enthusiasm.
I:77;547;Even today it's a wonderful journey through cinema history, and I for one had great fun watching the monster be born again, only to see his depressing demise, and absorb all that this film teaches us.
I:77;548;It's worth it for all ages, no matter what the decade.
I:77;549;Still one of the best mad scientist movies!
I:77;550;Another early movie that let your mind generate the fear.
I:77;551;Colin Clive's portrayal is right on for a driven scientist.
I:77;552;Driven right to the very edge of madness when the creature comes alive.
I:77;553;FRANKENSTEINFew monsters are so recognizable as James Whale's in Frankenstein as played by Boris Karloff and make.
I:77;554;But as great as that monster is, the movie is wonderful in other respects.
I:77;555;all make this one of the most well rounded horror films ever made and a continual joy to watch.
I:77;556;It's a noble plan and hits upon an age old fault of men.
I:77;557;what's great about the movie is Whale's adherence to Shelly's humanistic approach to the story.
I:77;558;All the characters are very real and sympathetic.
I:77;559;there are numerous memorable visuals in this movie.
I:77;560;The monster's first appearance as he walks into the room backwards and then the close.
I:77;561;the acting, while seemingly simple, was actually pretty in depth.
I:77;562;They are an odd ensemble and not only do they all give great performances, but they don't have a single dull moment between them.
I:77;563;Remember, in the novel the monster is actually an intelligent and physical marvel whereas Karloff's creature seems mentally dull, uncoordinated, incapable of speech or spiritual substance.
I:77;564;"Clive definied the classic image of the mad scientist, his line ""It's alive!"""
I:77;565;another aspect worth mentioning is how the movie flows.
I:77;566;It moves around very nicely so you're constantly engaged in the story.
I:77;567;Frankenstein's range of emotions go from ambitious scientist to humbled man in such a way that is totally compelling.
I:77;568;It never gets old and will always stand out as a solidly constructed movie.
I:77;569;It's effects and messages are just as potent today as they were in 1931 and it features some famous horror actors at their prime.
I:77;570;The very best movie from the genres very best director.
I:77;571;A timeless Hollywood Horror classic that should be in everyone's collection!
I:77;572;"the opening setting for the film is certainly impressive, with the tearful mourners and the ""mad"" doctor and henchman lurking in the background, waiting to take the freshly buried corpse (He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come)."
I:77;573;Clive is really the star in this one and it's his performance that kept me into this one for the most part, particularly the unforgettable sequence as he gives life to the monster in front of the stunned eyes of his soon to be wife Elizabeth, his friend Victor, and his old mentor Dr. Waldman.
I:77;574;"to conclude, I'll say 'Frankenstein' is just a ""good"" movie that certainly is a sufficient starting point for the greatness that would come 4 years later."
I:77;575;I would highly recommend this to others who love the old classics.
I:77;576;"If you love a movie, which embodies and defines the word ""Classic""."
I:77;577;I feel a person must have either an open mind to this story to be taken in, as dramatic and traumatic to the imagination or a love of the golden age of cinema.
I:77;578;this is one of Boris Karloff 's most defining career choices and the story written by Mary Shelley is well worth the price of admission, if it were released in the theater now.
I:77;579;They did a good job at cleaning up the video and audio.
I:77;580;It was great to watch this old time favorite especially after watching the newer slasher styled flicks.
I:77;581;These are much more cerebral than the new movies.
I:77;582;Captures all there is to know about black n white movies.
I:77;583;Stays nicely detailed to the novel.
I:77;584;Great to use in a british lit class.
I:77;585;This presentation of the classic James Whale 1931 film Frankenstein is the most perfect representation of this fine film, even beating out the nearly perfect laser disk presentation of several years back.
I:77;586;Not only is the movie represented with crystal clarity, but the art gallery and commentary add to this great product.
I:77;587;A must have for film fans and monster buffs.
I:77;588;Frankenstein (1931) is the second of many classic monster movies made by Universal Studios, and in my opinion it is simply the best.
I:77;589;James Whale directed this film (as well as Bride of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man) and did a wonderful job with it.
I:77;590;It is pretty scary too.
I:77;591;The scene where Frankenstein throws Little Maria into the water and drowns her is a very touching scene, because you really don't know who you want to feel sorry for more.
I:77;592;frankenstein is really the film that got me into the Universal monsters.
I:77;593;It is just pure perfection.
I:77;594;there is one scene that is stange but also humorous at the same time.
I:77;595;this is a great film that is truly unappreciated just like the sequel.
I:77;596;the scene in the windmill and the fire that destroys the monster is one of the best of all time.
I:77;597;I happily recommended this version to monster lovers and classic movie watchers everywhere.
I:77;598;James Whale's 1931 classic has it all: a fantastic script, top.
I:77;599;notch effects for its day, atmosphere in spades, a superlative stable of acting talent, and a director who was willing to take some risks.
I:77;600;six years after the film's initial release, thankfully restored (as much as possible) to the original state it was in despite the work of film censors in 1938, it's just as good as it was back in the day.
I:77;601;There's a lot more going on here, and Whale coaxed every subtext out of the material he could.
I:77;602;Still wonderful after all these years.
I:77;603;A Fantastic Classic for the Ages.
I:77;604;I grew up on this and loved it.
I:77;605;Having watched it for the first time in 35 years, I must say that it is still one of the greatest horror films ever made.
I:77;606;"You get a ""scientific"" explanation, a wonderfully creepy monster, and potential for sequels."
I:77;607;Indeed, I enjoyed it so much that I watched many versions, eventually to read the original, which I found astoundingly sophisticated and nuanced.
I:77;608;Perhaps it is too crude for my kids, but I am delighted that this is in my film library.
I:77;609;Even so, it is very entertaining, but make sure you don't watch it expecting to be frightened.
I:77;610;Boris Karloff wears the fright makeup for the first time, James Whale directs from a unique perspective, and Dwight Frye gives one of his best performances as Fritz the twisted dwarf.
I:77;611;The creaky production values add to the appeal of the film.
I:77;612;A memorable scene is the first time we see the living creature.
I:77;613;dimensional performance combines the menace of the monster and the human spirit within.
I:77;614;Colin Clive is edgy as the visionary doctor teetering on the brink of insanity.
I:77;615;Unlike King Kong which many claim is the best creature feature which inspired the great Harryhausen, this feature encompasses a fascinating creature due to legendary Karloff's amazing abilities to make him come alive along with a memorable top notch cast.
I:77;616;The atmosphere couldn't be any better, and the sequel is equally fine.
I:77;617;star rating because it's still THE classic horror film.
I:77;618;Boris Karloff brought such life and humanity to the character.
I:77;619;"the short film called ""Boo""I viewed the stills section with a veteran Hollywood special effects guy today."
I:77;620;The stills are beautifully rendered in full grayscale as well.
I:77;621;It is presented with audio from the film as a sort of Photoplay, and is a loving tribute to the genius that made the 1931 Frankenstein untouchable by sequels or remakes.
I:77;622;please note: during the Golden Age, studio stills were made with 8x10 cameras.
I:77;623;That's right, an 8x10 inch negative!
I:77;624;But mute the sound, and you'll see some uber.
I:77;625;"Golden Age Monster fans take note here
I:77;626;transfers of Nosferatu look anywhere near this good.
I:77;627;"but you'll also see equally pristine footage of the arcane film called ""The Cat Creeps"" a remake of ""Cat and the Canary""."
I:77;628;I have enjoyed it very much.
I:77;629;Great for a Friday night with the family.
I:77;630;Colin Clive plays the doctor so believably and so sincere that he is the definition of the character on film.
I:77;631;But what made this movie what it is was the direction by James Whale, truly a genius of his time.
I:77;632;Frankenstein is the epitome of Horror classic and this movie is essential viewing for anybody who call themselves Horror fans.
I:77;633;mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein as part of a contest to see who could write the best horror novel.
I:77;634;He succeeds and creates a towering monster with the brain of an abnormal child.
I:77;635;On his own, he seeks friendship and understanding, but everywhere he goes, he is misunderstood.
I:77;636;The film print is excellent, and viewers are treated with a short documentary about Boris Karloff, the man who played the monster.
I:77;637;Also included are two commentaries and several goodies like fun facts, a photo archive, and a documentary about horror films.
I:77;638;The movie was a good choice.
I:77;639;and the movie was an astonishing success.
I:77;640;Special kudos to makeup genius Jack Pierce and the influential art direction of Charles D. Hall.
I:77;641;Thanks to Whale's gothic flair, this Universal adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel helped define the horror genre while cementing its place in cinema history.
I:77;642;Having seen nearly all of the Universal horror films, most of which are great fun, this one is my favorite.
I:77;643;I was delighted to receive the video in the mail today.
I:77;644;My class of high school seniors has finished reading Mary Shelley's novel and will be taking their final tomorrow.
I:77;645;Afterwards, I thought they would really enjoy the film.
I:77;646;The acting, sets, script, camera work, and editing are ridiculously crude.
I:77;647;Say what you will, but the classic Universal Monsters had style, grace and class.
I:77;648;"I'd always preferred ""Dracula""'s stately, mannered, gothic atmosphere, so it took me many years ."
I:77;649;"Karloff's portrayal of the monster is an accomplished pantomime
I:77;650;The original 1999 edition, which I personally own, is still widely available on Amazon.
I:77;651;The newerLegacy Collectionand75th Anniversaryeditions contain similarly excellent film transfers and many of the same special features, with the addition of sequels in the former release and additional documentary material in the latter.
I:77;652;"given its importance to the development of early horror cinema, any horror fan worth their salt should see Universal's ""Frankenstein"" at least once during their lifetime."
I:77;653;In any event, spending a candlelit evening with such an entertaining classic is a no.
I:77;654;Still, the movie maintains its suspense and occasional humor when you watch it now.
I:77;655;Another great Classic movie with an excellent cast and eerie surroundings.
I:77;656;Of course, there are some great bits in the movie.
I:77;657;The ending is incredibly powerful and the horror of the monster's death in the mill is nothing compared to that of the final shot of the family of Frankenstein (the monster's creator) acting as if nothing at all had happened.
I:77;658;I can see that stylistically this is a very important film that brought German Expressionism to the horror genre and in many ways established the look of horror.
I:77;659;I have never seen Frankenstein look so clear and sharp.
I:77;660;i really felt that I was seeing the film on the big screen.
I:77;661;The bonus materials are excellent too, but it is the main course in all its polished, restored glory that really makes a horror fan rejoice!
I:77;662;This and Bride of Frankenstien together are by far the best version of the story of all time.
I:77;663;"James Whale's adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" is the most well."
I:77;664;"the story of ""Frankenstein"" is today more relevant than ever with the dramatic advances in the field of genetics and the ethical dilemmas that have accompanied them."
I:77;665;Yet at its heart, the film is a good old.
I:77;666;fest full of creepy shadows and chilling images.
I:77;667;Clive delivers an amazing performance as the mad genius who is driven to prove his theories true.
I:77;668;He is wonderfully complemented by Karloff who delivers spectacularly in the role of his career.
I:77;669;Frankenstein has the good fortune of having a pair of them.
I:77;670;While dated and simplistic in many ways, this is so much more than a monster film.
I:77;671;Even today as we have our lives improved and extended by technologies unimaginable at the time of the film (let alone the book), the entire world still struggles with these issues.
I:77;672;Will we return to the simple, short, and technology.
I:77;673;free life of the middle ages or move forward to the wonders still promised by the enlightenment?
I:77;674;Undoubtedly the book and the film will continue to play a major role in how our culture struggles with that question.
I:77;675;The makeup, set decoration, lighting, script, even the over.
I:77;676;top acting in some cases, is fresh and exciting.
I:77;677;Though the original FRANKENSTEIN is not particularly scary to a modern viewer and is more inspired by Mary Shelley's groundbreaking gothic novel than true to it this classic film is still very worth seeing.
I:77;678;see film for horror movie fans and classic movie fans who like 30s to 40s stuff.
I:77;679;It is the phenomenal work serving as the basis of Frankenstein films, theater performances and animation films that has been produced since then.
I:77;680;So when you talk about Frankenstein it is 1931 film from which our long.
I:77;681;So the drama sounds as if thatrical performance was extended into a movie.
I:77;682;The reason the film is viewable for modern moviegoers is mainly because of Boris Karloff who made an excellent performance as a monster created by Dr, Frankenstein by using murderer's brain.
I:77;683;Part of the classic movie was refeatured in Spanish filmThe Spirit of the Beehive (Criterion Collection)at the tragic scene of a little girl meets the monster.
I:77;684;That scene really is a great scene how this movie made into a classic.
I:77;685;I have seen many snippets and spoofs of this movie, but it was fun to see the original (on Halloween night).
I:77;686;The premise of this one is simple and very effective: A mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein collects lifeless cadaver parts and assembles them in his lab.
I:77;687;On a stormy night Dr. Frankenstein and his lab assistant Fritz discover a way to bring this creation to life.
I:77;688;This chilling tale set the perfect template for countless horror movies to come.
I:77;689;in this excellent 1931 horror classic, the townsfolk give a toast to Young Frankenstein!
I:77;690;An original documentary (plus BOO!
I:77;691;"i keep seeing other reviewers saying the original is the best,and while i'll give it points for being first,""The Bride of Frankenstein""is by far the better film!In fact,I'd go as far to say that""The Bride""is a bona fide american film classic,and defies genre."
I:77;692;a must see for fans of true classic hollywood films,it is James Whale's most fully realised project!
I:77;693;this epic classic film boris proves he is truly frankensteins monster and he truly is one of hollywoods classic actors in this epic film adaptation of mary shelley's classic tale
I:77;694;Frankenstein(1931) is one of the greatest movies ever.
I:77;695;It is so good that everyone has seen it at least once and everyone 'knows' the plot.
I:77;696;disc set is as good as the film.
I:77;697;The picture and sound of the movie is as good as when the movie was first made.
I:77;698;I feel that every movie buff.
I:77;699;will love having this set in his collection.
I:77;700;"Universal's ""Frankenstein"" (1931) has become the most iconic and powerful vision of the Frankenstein story in modern culture."
I:77;701;Some of that is well deserved from an historical film perspective, but it comes at a cost.
I:77;702;By looking at the history, we can understand it.
I:77;703;"at the time, ""talkies"" were a very new technology, and even movies were a new medium."
I:77;704;Film had yet to truly come into its own, so it had to borrow from other venues, and the closest one was of course, the stage.
I:77;705;dracula, the movie, was based on an extremely popular stage play (in which Lugosi portrayed the main character).
I:77;706;He was perfect for the part on stage, being tall, suave and sophisticated.
I:77;707;the perfect image of a Romanian count of ancient heritage.
I:77;708;He was hit on stage, and carried it over very successfully to the film.
I:77;709;Ironically, as horrible as Franklenstin's monster was in the movie, Karloff himself was a very handsome man, and by all reports a 'class act', being kind and gentle, with a beautiful speaking voice.
I:77;710;in my opinion, the success of the film rides on Karloff's shoulders.
I:77;711;Shelly herself had attended some of the plays and it is reported that she found them 'amusing'.
I:77;712;the novel, Frankenstein, is very complex and psychological, perfectly suited to reading, but very difficult to dramatize on stage or screen.
I:77;713;It wasn't for many years that film screenplays took true advantage of the power of film in its own right and brought it to the high level of an art form that we enjoy today.
I:77;714;Clive and the others of the cast came from this tradition, so it is natural that they would bring it into this film.
I:77;715;In such a light, you can see what advancements it made in the world of cinema.
I:77;716;so enjoy the film for what it is, the way it is.
I:77;717;It certainly has stood the test of time.
I:77;718;This is an excellent film.
I:77;719;If you enjoy old movies and are a classic fan, you must have this movie in your collection.
I:77;720;The print is in excellent shape !
I:77;721;including a very informative documentary and a short film as an extra.
I:77;722;A great non dialogue performance.
I:77;723;A masterpiece of how science can be misused.
I:77;724;Caveat: This is the TCM 75th anniversary edition of one film .
I:77;725;this is a spectacular presentation of James Whale's Frankenstein remastered, fully restored and with a stereo soundtrack.
I:77;726;Colin Clive is edgy and frighteningly intense.
I:77;727;The accompanying documentaries and trailers are fascinating, particularly the almost 2.
I:77;728;Lugosi chose not to do the film and Florey moved along with him to his next project.
I:77;729;Two careers were born along with the Monster.
I:77;730;Jack Pierce's make up for Karloff was astounding for its time rivaling the best work of Lon Chaney.
I:77;731;Still, the photography and Whale's direction are both strong.
I:77;732;Performances are uniformly excellent with Dwight Frye notable for his scenery chewing as the hunchbacked assistant to Dr. Frankenstein.
I:77;733;The commentary is always interesting and provides much insight into the era (including the difficulties when the film was reissued.
I:77;734;The Hays Commission dictated that the film be edited prior to re.
I:77;735;Frankenstein isn't Whale or Karloff's best film but clearly one of their most important.
I:77;736;This is one of the first film adaptations of the Frankenstein novel by Mary Shelly, and one of the best.
I:77;737;Finally they bring it to life, even though Henry's wife, and friends warn this is not an affair humans should be involved with, they say leave creation for God.
I:77;738;this film is a classic, and is highly enjoyable.
I:77;739;One of the first horror/science fiction films ever made, and has influences many others.
I:77;740;The acting is great, and direction superb.
I:77;741;The film is very fun to watch, and is quite risque for the time it was made.
I:77;742;All film lovers should see this.
