1;This was a gift for my husband.
2;He of course loves westerns and really loves Clint Eastwood!!
3;I very much enjoyed watching it again!
4;High Plains Drifter stands as a testament to the spirit of the art.
5;film Western, and carries the Sergio Leone inspired existential qualities within it.
6;The film implies this, hence he knows a lot more about the townspeople then he lets on.
7;Also contains an impeccable understated performance from Verna Bloom.
8;At the heart of all this is sweet revenge, and the Stranger gets it good.
9;One of the all time best westerns.
10;Even if you don't like westerns, you might enjoy this one.
11;A classic, and to my mind, the best presentation of the Man with No Name.
12;One of the his best works ever!
13;Great story and music score as well.
14;all done with a disturbingly casual intensity.
15;the film unfolds wonderfully, moving effortlessly between dark drama and self.
16;shipping was kind of slow but i contacted them about it and they took care of it, great customer service.
17;This movie is one of the best damn westerns in the universe.
18;This whole movie is a joy to behold.
19;I LOVE westerns and this is one of my favorites.
20;The eerie mysterious underline makes it very suspenseful.
21;A lean, anarchist, and spooky western.
22;Eastwood's second directorial effort is also one of his best.
23;Let's paint the town red, baby!
24;Eastwood plays a mysterious drifter in this film, who is followed by a very chilling tune throughout the movie.
25;Great film that gives off an extremely powerful feel of mystery and suspense, a definite must see!
26;Great action, irony and dialogue.
27;Example: Sheriff to Eastwood I want to talk to you about Billy.
28;One thing leads to another with a great metaphysical climax and the fadeout departure of the Eastwood anti.
29;if you like the Clint Eastwood genre, you'll like this one.
30;Classic tale of a wronged man exacting his revenge upon those who betrayed him.
31;One of his best westerns.
32;Great story of good ultimately triumphing over evil.
33;Clint Eastwood provides a great setting for this intense drama of small town greed, murder and revenge.
34;Thoroughly enjoyed the movie .
35;great storyline and great camera work.
36;The many perceptive reviews here cover the film well, but I would suggest that much of the film, especially the first part, is really comedy.
37;The opening scene is amazing.
38;The Stranger rides into town.
39;this is certainly a great and and thought.
40;The movie is just fine itself, but I thought I will be getting it in Full Screen, but it came in widescreen.
41;westerns) were always far superior.
42;Clint Eastwood s actual breakthrough came with the Dollar Trilogy .
43;spaghetti westerns made the western look more realistic by making them dirtier and centering more on anti.
44;eastwood's performance in front and behind the camera is superb.
45;I love the movies he directs, he has a unique style that is far superior to most of what Hollywood has to offer.
46;Also the supporting cast is fantastic, the atmosphere is eerie and keeps you on the edge of your seat, as the story is full of surprises and its conclusion is jaw.
47;dropping and brilliant, giving the entire movie a surreal feeling.
48;the score is fantastic and adds very much to the dark atmosphere.
49;Once again Eastwood does it with great style.
50;An unusual dream of a sheriff that was whipped to death haunts him.
51;As the story unveils itself we are drawn further into the past of the towns people.
52;The supporting cast is very good and the sets and music are great.
53;This is one of Clint Eastwood's best westerns.
54;This film is as good today as when it was first released.
55;"Perhaps it's his air of mystery
56;western, but once you get into it you know something is going on behind what you're seeing.
57;Eastwood is unforgettable as the man with no name aided by Dee Bartons Eeerie great score and A great supporting cast this is A must see Western !
58;One of my favorite Eastwood westerns that I come back to often because it's so very good.
59;It'll keep your eyes glued to the screen.
60;A awesome mix of Clint Eastwood western and supernatural revenge saga with its' eerie score and familiar """"man."""
61;Eastwood takes The Man With No Name persona and pushes him into a new realm, sucking all essence of humanity out of him and creating a striking, mesmerizing, and unique hero .
62;His arrival draws much attention, particularly in three gun.
63;The deal seems like a good one, that is until the stranger starts taking liberties above and beyond what they believe to be fair and equitable, causing consternation among more than a few residents (as a result the townspeople start turning on each other).
64;As the town prepares for their arrival (including a spiffy, new paint job, at the stranger's behest), we continue to learn more and more of a past incident within the town, one that gruesome secret shared by all, rationalized away by most.
65;As far as Eastwood, well, he's Eastwood, and presents himself a much as one would expect in a role like this (cool, distant, and enigmatic).
66;I thought his direction wonderful along with his performance.
67;As far as the rest of the cast, primarily made up of character actors, I thought they all did very well, and the story provided just enough material and attention on each given their respective roles within the film.
68;All in all I thought this a great film, and one of the better westerns to come out of the 1970s.
69;The movie itself is great and I would give it 4 stars.
70;"This town is called ""Lago"", and is owned primarily by a mining company."
71;eastwood's first western as a director is dark, sinister and mysterious.
72;truth and justice are the themes of all great westerns.
73;The film leaves this question open for the viewer.
74;She endeavors to bump into him, and he sees right through the charade.
75;He takes her to a stable and has his way with her.
76;She later claims it to be, but she embraced him during the sexual act.
77;If you're a Clint Eastwood Western fan this is the one to get.
78;one of the best Clint Eastwood westerns.
79;ray, totally enjoyable, highly recommended for anyone who likes westerns / Clint Eastwood.
80;In Clint Eastwood's second directorial effort he takes his cues from his mentor, Sergio Leone, but adds enough unique touches that distinguish him as a singular voice.
81;heroic but still retained a moral code.
82;What Eastwood leaves you with is alot of moral ambiguity about whom to root for in this intriguing film.
83;It's a daring and ambitious turn that requires the audience to evaluate their concept of good and evil.
84;level Clint Eastwood masterpiece that combines gritty western with dark humor and psychological mindplay.
85;like in its delivery of serious imagery and characterizations.
86;Excellent performances by the entire cast with Eastwood leading the way through the miserable lives of the pathetic citizens of Lagos.
87;Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the desert.
88;What I mean by this not being politically correct is that, despite herself, she likes it!
89;That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus that surely influenced Eastwood.
90;Camus's stranger is an existential anti.
91;He takes action, and he is very good at it.
92;This somehow inspires her to leave the corrupt town.Yes, the town, like most of human society is corrupt.
93;It is only the ubermensch, that rare breed celebrated in the works of the German philosopher, who has the skill, the strength and the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would use violence to achieve their ends.
94;filled revenge plots was a good way to do it, Eastwood is interested in also making a philosophic (and perhaps political) statement.
95;We are degenerate, we humans, he is saying, except for those rare individuals who take the law into their own hands, make their own rules, and through superior skill and bravery, make their own luck and create their own reality, as does his stranger.
96;by all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.
97;Great digital remaster in High Definition.
98;I watch these old westerns at least once or twice a year.
99;Good price, good service Amazon Prime.
100;The movie version gives a more complete picture of Clint's character, as well as the motivation of the supporting characters.
101;my favorite movie, thanks to amazon and their vendors i was able to get it at a good price in great condition.
102;would order from again anytime, great experience.
103;seeking outlaws soon to be released from prison, and subsequently intimidates, terrorizes, and humiliates everyone when the Stranger himself signs on to protect the town.
104;This story is about the spirit of a town marshal who was murdered by the people in a town to protect illegal mining.
105;He exacts while causing them o reflect on what they did.
106;spirited and narrow, it's not a whole lot of fun to watch beyond a few sporadic action shots and one or two well.
107;Another great movie with Clint Eastwood which made him great.
108;Playing the roll of a cowboy
109;See all of Clint's personality in this showdown.
110;He show his true self here!
111;This is a classic Eastwood film.
112;If you're a fan of others such as Hang 'Em High, or the Man with No Name trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad and The Ugly), then this is a good one for you.
113;"True, Clint has played the role of a ""Man With No Name"" some umpteen times, but he's so darn good at it that it seems just as fresh and original every time."
114;Billy Barty is the most memorable as the pushed.
115;The landscape, however, makes up for it, as it is some of the best I've ever seen.
116;"I mean this in the sense that in a Western, the landscape is usually meant to enhance the movie's atmosphere and story
117;And while it does bear a resemblance to the spaghetti westerns Eastwood made in the 1960s with director Sergio Leone as """"The Man With No Name"""", it also takes on some chilling supernatural overtones."""
118;but the more often Eastwood's character gets to have his way with the town, the more the people of Lago begin to turn on one another.
119;But the mysterious High Plains Drifter has a surprise for all concerned.
120;"thanks to a very good screenplay by Ernest Tidyman (SHAFT
121;The psychological tensions in the town are laid out fairly well, and Lewis and his outlaw partners are appropriately nasty.
122;Billy Curtis' supporting role as the town midget, and the only one sympathetic to Eastwood's cause, is an interesting and offbeat one, and it works.
123;With superb cinematography by Bruce Surtees and a haunting score by Dee Barton that echoes Ennio Morricone's scores for Leone, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a long way away from the John Wayne school, especially in terms of violence, but it remains an impressive mark on Eastwood's long resume as both actor and director.
124;Nothing like a good stick of hickory _ good ol' Clint !
125;What a great career and over normal guy, love his house off Pebble Beach golf course in CA !
126;this is a classic and now that I own it it's even better since I can watch it over and over again!
127;Another of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies.
128;Good performances and well shot.
129;High Plains Drifter (1973) is one of the best and most original westerns of all time.
130;It is also of of the best films that Clint Eastwood has ever made.
131;It was only the second film that Eastwood ever directed, yet it is a western masterpiece, as it funnels all of the violent, harsh, and brutal images and themes that were first seen in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns (which made Eastwood an international star) into one picture.
132;Eastwood's compulsive, surrealistic imagery is both haunting and powerful, and it works in pefect tandem with Dee Barton's eerie score.
133;The western town, constructed by Henry Bumstead out of raw wood is a classic, and helps to reveal the mean.
134;spirited hypocrisy and vicious economic determinism of the townspeople.
135;It is extremely challenging, unnerving, apparitional, allegorical, and curiously memorable.
136;This is Clint Eastwood at his most daring and outrageous, as both an actor and director, testing the audience to see if it will support this most radical of anti.
137;High Plains Drifter is my favorite film of all time, and it is not to be missed!
138;The outstanding outdoor scenery of this somewhat esoteric Western makes its plot more unnerving and beguiling than the ordinary Western.
139;The results are of the fantastic and the true nature of Eastwood's motivations are slowly unveiled.
140;This is a riveting film.
141;This is Clint Eastwood's first masterpiece as a director.
142;This was Eastwood's 3rd film (after Play Misty for Me and Breezy), and it still remains one of his best films.
143;Misty and Breezy are excellent films, but this one is far better than both of them.
144;Yes, there are humourous elements in it, but it's a morally complex, eerie, and brilliant piece of filmmaking.
145;The ending is downright surreal, but it works brilliantly.
146;Even the supporting players (especially Billy Curtis) are excellent here.
147;Eastwood shot this masterpiece in 24 days, and under budget too.
148;This was Clint's first great film.
149;The shooting is something to behold.
150;highly recommended for fans of Eastwood.
151;Beautiful cinematography, believable dialogue and engaging characters at every turn.
152;the eerie feeling of this movie is truly understated.
153;Could be the greatest Western ever made.
154;A minor classic of the genre.
155;This is a neat twist on """"High Noon,"""" in which Gary Cooper's Sheriff Will Kane had to face the men who swore to kill him alone, because no one in the town had the guts to help him"
156;the town midget, played by Bill Curtis .
157;It's a brilliant example of Bumstead's minimalistic Expressionism.
158;the final scene is a brilliant deja.
159;"i consider this movie to be Eastwood's greatest directorial effort, slightly above ""Bird"" and ""The Unforgiven."""
160;"Singular in purpose, relentless in its dark vision of humanity, ""High Plains Drifter"" is the ultimate revenge tale."
161;What made Sergio Lione's westerns so good was their sense of adventure as well as how much fun they were.
162;ass one liners, and the other characters are colorful and cool as well (Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes/ Douglas Mortimer, Eli Wallach as Tuco.)
163;"This is one of the superb Clint Eastwood westerns
164;He walks into a saloon, orders a beer, and is taunted by three thugs.
165;The town people are amazed at his skill.
166;He helps the town prepare for the arrival of the three thugs by taking material from its citizens.
167;He has the town painted red and changes its name on the sign that reads Largo to Hell.
168;Clint Eastwood deals with one of the most serious subjects of the West in this film, and he still has no name, even if he is identified to a dead man.
169;In the meantime the drifter reveals two racisms among the nice people of this nice Lago city : against Indians of course, but also against Mexicans.
170;I loved high plains drifter, Clint did a stunning performance in this movie, the director did a good job on costumes from that error
171;High Plains Drifter is a superior Eastwood Western that takes The Man With No Name characterone step further into the realm of myth.
172;an impressive tale of revenge and atonement.
173;High Plains Drifter ranks with the best of Leone's westerns.
174;It is an excellent film and a classic of the genre, with a supernatural twist.
175;hearted killer with a quick draw and a sharp eye for pretty women.
176;What transpires draws the viewer into the showdown with all the high drama of Eastwood's better.
177;the movie is very entertaining and certainly makes its point.
178;You gotta love Clint in this old western role.
179;the musical score is the best in any clint eastwood western.
180;the mood in this film is ruminesant with the end of the call of the wild.
181;I cant put my finger on what makes this film so memorable.
182;So high def might no be the best viewing.
183;This film shines in high def with its vibrant colors.
184;The sound is good not great.
185;Great job on a bizarre horror western.
186;A man no one knows rides into a town with a shady present and past.
187;As the show continues you start finding out why.
188;But he does accomplish what he came to town to do.
189;This was a gift for someone.
190;The cinematography and his directing are quite strong.
191;There's plenty of action and enough depth to the story to keep interest.
192;Everyone pretty much gets their just deserves by the end"
193;Critically acclaimed when released, it's well worth seeing, as it was part of the continuing evolution of the Man With No Name Western sub.
194;The picture is excellent, the sound is clear but front speaker heavy.
195;how he protects the town and who he is (or was) makes for a very sharp western myth at its best.
196;no real extras(trailer and production notes), but film looks good,clear good sound,and even gives you both widescreen and pan and scan!
197;"Eastwood's eerie, magnificent ""Drifter,"" his second effort in the director's chair, turns the final showdown clich of the Hollywood Western on its head: Instead of confronting the killer posse alone, for money or out of brute contempt, The Stranger teaches the cowardly townsfolk how to defend themselves."
198;Such flashes of dark humor animate the story, as do The Stranger's haunting flashbacks, the austere sets, and the cast of irregulars.
199;"Enigmatic and violent, ""Drifter"" reworks the Man With No Name persona into a mystical folk hero, and the effect is riveting."
200;Watched it today and it was great and will watch it again and again and maybe even again and again loved it.
201;well, you'll have to watch to see how everything unfolds.
202;The cinematography is great, the scenery is great, the camera angles are great, the music is great, and the acting is great.
203;This movie has gained in stature over the last four decades and is now considered a classic Western.
204;high Plains Drifter comes highly recommended.
205;"This gives the old saying, ""painting the town red,"" a whole new meaning."
206;his films are always well.
207;done, and he always plays the same basic part, which his audience obviously loves.
208;He enters the small mining town of Lago.
209;What happens next is original, violent, and politically incorrect.
210;this is Eastwoods best work in my opinion.
211;People lump this movie in with the trilogy sometimes, but there are great differences between them.
212;He came to destory the town and deal out vengence on the people.
213;And King probably got some of his ideas from this movie.
214;A friendly warning though there are some strong scences in this movie.
215;But if you are as jaded as I am you will love this movie.
216;Great movie one of his best western.
217;"A good movie to watch
218;This is Clint Eastwood at his imcomparable best.
219;In this classic western, Clint Eastwood performs admirably as producer, director and of course starring in the lead role.
220;High Plains Drifter is an excellent tale that highlights Eastwood's talents in this genre, whether it's his """"Stranger"""" type aura or the clipped but poignant lines."""
221;This great western has a superb script and exceptional performances by Eastwood and the other actors.
222;Its surreal style, unexpected plot twists and great camera angles serve well to enhance this movies overall appearance.
223;What follows is a western that is one of the best and a benchmark for all westerns to follow.
224;i highly recommend this great Eastwood western to any and all die hard or casual fans of the genre or the actor.
225;It does have a great trailer and some production notes that are quite interesting to read through on the screen.
226;It is a stark, moody, violent and compelling morality tale with outstanding production, fine direction, and uniformly excellent performances from a skilled cast.
227;Clint adroitly melded techniques learned from Sergio Leone with his own unique vision to craft a true classic.
228;If you like the old Eastwood westerns you'll definitely like this.
229;One of my favorite movies.
230;I'm sure a cleaner print could be found and enhanced.
231;My husband and I are both Clint Eastwood fans and we love ALL of his westerns.
232;It is a fun movie, tho.
233;Of course, it's Clint Eastwood and that makes anything worth watching.
234;I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan and prove me personally this is my favorite movie, it's almost a bit of a ghost story Hidden in the Western.
235;The story was pretty good and the subtheme of both worldly and otherworldly justice was interesting twist.
236;"This is one of Eastwood's best westerns
237;ray transfer for it's 40th Anniversary that will make Western fans proud and fans of Clint Eastwood want to add this to their collections.
238;Filmed at Mono Lake, the cinematography by Bruce Surtees looks stunning in this Blu.
239;ray presentation from Universal with vibrant colors that are a wonder to behold.
240;The restoration team at Universal deserves lots of credit for making this great Western look brand new.
241;The production design is another standout given a whole new life through this Blu ray presentation.
242;You can really see the detail in both the interiors and exteriors.
243;This Blu ray also includes both Digital Copy and UltraViolet and comes in a slipcase.
244;If you love Westerns or a fan of Clint Eastwood, then you'll be more than pleased with this great new Blu.
245;Lots of violence and lots of trouble for the town, and a surprise ending that'll make you shake your head.
246;Very well done I really like Clint Eastwood a big fan.
247;His start was in westerns and this is a classic if you like him.
248;The sets, cinematography, and acting are certainly good in this film.
249;It's the script I found a little over the top.
250;A huge amount of critical ink has nevertheless been expended on it.
251;Like all great Westerns its theme is basically extremely simple: no good will come of evil.
252;Not a minor but a major classic, including some fine cinematic moments ( the transformation of the town into the red.
253;forget """"Citizen Kane"""", this is probably the best."""
254;Its moral impact is certainly far clearer if fairly right of center .
255;well it IS a western !
256;This is one of the best westerns ever made .
257;"Lago means ""lake"" and the town sits on an unnamed body of water
258;I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and """"good"""" characters in the film."""
259;Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore?
260;directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters.
261;The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second.
262;ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.
263;My husband loves the westerns that Clint Eastwood was in and I bought this for him for one of his stocking stuffers.
264;By the time the final scene arrives, you share the directorial disgust with the town he's created, and the murderous denouement is welcome.
265;Awesome film good experience ordering and got exactly what I wanted and expected no surprises.
266;This is a great western with supernatural overtones.
267;Probably the best or one of the best westerns ever made.
268;Even though you know what the end will be it still keeps you watching.
269;I've seen this movie many, many times, still watch it all the way thru.
270;this film is a western but the story line stands above any western i have seen.
271;anyone that i have recommend this movie to are impressed because they don't feel it is really a western but film noir.
272;One of Clint's best westerns.
273;'High Plains Drifter' is my very favourite Eastwood movie (and that's saying something).
274;The significant difference is that there's people to cheer for in those films .
275;bruce Surtees camerawork effortlessly conveys this .
276;geoffrey Lewis is grotesquely brilliant as the drunken, heartless, leering chief villain, and the rare Verna Bloom is handsome and sassy as the rebellious wife of one of Lago's slimy conspirators.
277;"High Plains Drifter was only Clint Eastwood's second directorial effort, but already we can see that a master is at work, and if that wasn't enough, he also stared in, and produced the film, through his own ""Malpaso"" company."
278;The film is very straightforward, at least on the surface.
279;Starting with an eerily atmospheric, deceptively calm, opening sequence, The Stranger arrives in Lago.
280;And that brings us full.
281;And that brings us to the `rape' scene that has upset so many people.
282;In fact the only character that manages to surprise The Stranger is the Preacher, who shows, in one cynically comical scene, that he's quite capable of serving God and mammon both!
283;"An ambush of the killers is planned, and as a final act of degradation, The Stranger has the residents paint the whole town red, renames it ""Hell,"" and sets up a ""Welcome Home Boys"" street party for the returning killers."
284;needless to say, they return to one HELL of a party!
285;eastwood at his Best,best western of its time.
286;great Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.
287;It was a very exciting western.
288;Very unusual and had a great ending
289;Clint plays almost an avenging spirit who returns to seek justice for a past crime and does so with his usual coolness.
290;Eastwood is wonderful throughout the whole film and even sports a pistol with a Cobra painted on the handle (cool! )
291;This is a great Western to add to any collection.
292;This is a Christmas gift for him.
293;I enjoy watching these movies also.
294;The movie (High Plains Drifter 40th anniversary edition) is a classic and I give that 5 Stars.
295;Good content for the price.
296;I did give it a few for entertainment value.
297;The release also includes French audio and subtitles for English and Spanish.
298;Overall this is an excellent Blu.
299;I really enjoy the westerns and Clint Eastwood, but with all honesty fid many of the above reviews a little exagerrated.
300;Clint Eastwood is a great movies to watch.
301;Critics and audiences made a huge deal over Unforgiven as being innovative and being a modern Western.
302;Those of us who love the Western will never pass up a chance to watch it in reruns.
303;"hero and the forerunner of many ""revisionist"" Westerns to come."
304;The exotic location in the desert, near Lake Mono in the California Sierras, certainly gives the film a fresh and refined look among Westerns.
305;the sparkling colors of the backgrounds and the changing cloud formations gave effective shots.
306;the film has certainly the most dramatic opening sequence of any Western.
307;The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake.
308;and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa.
309;A town heavy intervenes: 'Flea.
310;The drifter replies: 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!
311;His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor.
312;The town reaction to his is reserved.
313;High Plains Drifter is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art.
314;But the best part is how it's shot, and you get a real chance to see how The Stranger views the townfolks and the other way around.
315;My husband really likes it.
316;"Part ghost story, part revenge western, more than a little silly, nonetheless, Eastwood the director gave notice of a solid and exciting talent
317;This is a perfect film for any man who wants to be frozen in time.
318;Yes, it is compelling and hard to turn away from.
319;High Plains Drifter (1973) remains one of the finest Westerns of the past 30 years, though it was sadly underrated during its initial release.
320;The film's psychological and supernatural elements are much stronger when viewed in a modern context.
321;actor Clint Eastwood utilizes the genre to explore the darker aspects of human nature.
322;From a cinematic perspective, """"High Plains Drifter"""" is superior to all the Eastwood."""
323;and benefits from repeated viewings.
324;This film really holds up.
325;A great Western with a dark backstory, High Plains Drifter delivers on everything from suspense to action, one.
326;This is one of Clint Eastwood's best efforts.
327;clearly, Eastwood is using everything he learned at the feet of the master Sergio Leone, but goes the master one better.
328;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly had a strong anti.
329;war message on a grand scale.
330;Drifter is a more interior kind of study of group corruption, and the place of the a. moral avanger within the panoply of human foibles.
331;the role of the dwarf, whom The Stranger appoints first as Mayor and then as Sheriff of the town, simply to grind the faces of the towspeople in their own corruption, is a brilliant bit of Sergio Leone parody put on steroids!The entire movie is paced excellently and has a very satisfying balance.
332;all in all, this is a quintessential Eastwood film, and is probably the capstone of the Sergio Leone style Western.
333;One can imagine the master grinning and nodding in approval during his first viewing of the pupils fledgling production!
334;This movie and Pale Rider are our two favorite movies of all time.
335;Several readers comment on the existential qualities of this movie, and they are right on.
336;He acquires this role because he possesses the attributes that the denizens of Lagos revere: courage and a quick draw.
337;This vision is scary to watch unfold, especially since the townspeople put up so little resistance considering the magnitude of the Stranger's demands.
338;It is astonishing that the superman can so easily win over and conquer the women, religious figures and political figures of the town, thus underscoring Nietzsche's point that most people are timid and can easily be crushed and proselytized by a superman.
339;Eastwood is the director, and is brilliant in the familiar role of the Stranger with No Name.
340;The scenes in the barber's office, bar and country store are classic.
341;despite these (small) flaws, High Plains Drifter should rank as one of the best Westerns ever made.
342;It is dark as sable cloth, but is also exciting and dramatic.
343;A great movie that all existentialists, Eastwood fans or Western buffs should be familiar with.
344;Clint EastwoodOne of Eastwood's best in the old spaghetti western genre, certainly my favorite spaghetti
345;High Plains Drifter is fiction based on fact.
346;"He also gives them more ""eye for an eye"" by allowing the same toughs who killed the sheriff (or himself) to kill the culpable townsfolk."
347;"this is the best of the old Eastwood westerns, and may be the best of ALL westerns due in no small part to its implied commentary on America's ""anti."
348;Another timeless classic from Clint Eastwood!
349;The fact that he directed this movie makes this film that much better.
350;Eastwood fits the role perfectly as the unknown drifter in Legos.
351;His demeanor and tough guy attitude rates this film as a perfect 5 for me.
352;Part western, part psychological treatise, and all Clint, this is a unique vision of the western that delivers a sharp commentary on fear, guilt, revenge, and greed.
353;The acting is very good with highlights including Geoffrey Lewis as head bad guy Stacey Bridges and Verna Bloom as the lone conscience of the town.
354;this movie forces us to confront our own moral ambiguity and is a highlight of the revisionist westerns of the time.
355;what a cool thing to have my favorite Clint Eastwood Western on restored Hi.
356;One of Clint's best westerns.
357;Like all great movies, it stands the test of time.
358;Good supporting cast, memorable characters.
359;This was always my favorite Clint Eastwood Western.
360;UNFORGIVEN would come close years later, but I still enjoy DRIFTER, Clint's first Western as a director (he directed PLAY MISTY FOR ME previously).
361;the supernatural touches and haunting wisps of music add another layer of mystery to the story.
362;it all gives the film a lot of style and intrigue.
363;it makes for a very cool Western.
364;I've seen it twice in the last 3 years, and it just gets duller and dumber.
365;Don't get me wrong, I love Clint.
366;They're much more entertaining and original, not to mention deserving of their reputation(s).
367;This classic western deserves better than the studio gave.
368;this is another fine piece of work by clint eastwood.
369;he rarely disappoints and that is especially true in this movie.
370;Clint Eastwood stars in and directs the film.
371;This stranger is also very good with a side arm.
372;Oh my soul, be prepared for the coming of the Stranger.
373;One of the guys is speaking in the front of the church.
374;this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?
375;I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
376;For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
377;"And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth."""
378;The most fitting reprisal being, perhaps, having the townspeople paint the town red, and then rename it Hell .
379;most westerns are the shoot 'em up kind, which we enjoy.
380;Finally a beautiful copy of this movie wonderful transfer!
381;I classic movie that it should be in everyone's collection
382;It is possible to argue which of Eastwood's movies are his best, but High Plains Drifter should surely be counted among them.
383;Clint Eastwood's second film as a director, High Plains Drifter, has to be one of the most dynamic Western stories ever to hit the big screen.
384;The Stranger paints the town red, and renames Lago, Hell.
385;This film is a must.
386;Eastwood demonstrated why he is a legend by directing an excellent and unique picture, and playing the dual role to perfection of the silent good guy/bad guy.
387;High Plains Drifter is a great movie .
388;Its corrupting effects are hidden by pleasant facades of the buildings.
389;the film certainly merits five stars.
390;It's an assured second film from Eastwood as a director.
391;The script by Ernest Tidyman (with uncredited rewrites by Dean Reisner)marvelously captures many of the elements that made Sergio Leone's westerns so popular and manages to invert many of them at the same time.
392;Reportedly inspired by a subgenre of samurai films revenge films, Eastwood chose to make the film when the treatment intrigued him.
393;Tidyman's (The French Connection)screenplay is lean and compact providing a perfect frame work that echoes and compliments the films that Eastwood made for Leone.
394;The haunting musical score also echoes Morricone's scores for Leone's films without imitating them.
395;It also deserves a commentary track from star/director Eastman as well as a documentary on this magnificent film.
396;That, along with a retrospective documentary and interviews is really what this terrific film deserves.
397;There is the original trailer (in pan and scan format) and production notes.
398;As a result, some of the credits appear at the very edge of the screen.
399;eastwood deserves kudos for this fine western which was a pivotal film in his career as both director and star.
400;Hopefully, this film, like Unforgiven, will receive the deluxe presentation it deserves.
401;High Planes Drifter and Pale Rider are my two most favorite westerns.
402;never tire of client eastwood, he is a great actor and a great western movie star.
403;this movie was good and the story line was well done.
404;The Twighlight Zone meets the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
405;This midget, who knows how to act, plays a major role throughout the movie.
406;As far as midget performances go, this guy ranks right up there with the Wizard of Oz and anything Joe Pesci has done.
