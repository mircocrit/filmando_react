1;I loved the plot and actors are a nice touch for the movie.
2;Some of the scenes I enjoyed a lot.
3;Would love to watch it again with a family.
4;The original is a comedy classic, and I laugh just as hard every time I watch it.
5;Falk and Arkin are superb, and the supporting characters don't disappoint.
6;laws is a great comedy.
7;We enjoy each time we share a viewing with friends or family.
8;Remember the time period in which it was made so take that into account.
9;But the chemistry between Falk and Arkin is true classic comedy!
10;Classic lines you will quote forever.
11;dianne Crittenden, who did the casting for the 1979 original, deserves a lifetime achievement award for pairing up Arkin and Falk.
12;it is hilarious with a great plot.
13;the actors reallly play off each other well and Ryan Reynolds is wonderful in it.
14;Amazon is a great place to puchase previously viewed movies.
15;I got this movie for $1 and it is just like new.
16;Both of these are great but the 1979 version is much better.
17;The updated version does have a lot of appeal though.
18;laws is a hilarious movie where Michael Douglas shines as an actor portraying an outrageously over the top CIA agent who takes his son in law (played by Albert Brooks, you know, the guy who does the voice acting for Simpsons characters) on an adventure of a lifetime.
19;the first 20 minutes aren't necessarily appealing, but stick with the storyline and the film will probably win you over soon enough.
20;The role he plays here is extremely funny.
21;It's always Michael Douglas' character who is in perfect form.
22;just an overall really humorous film.
23;laws was a great work of art and a delight for anyone who watches it.
24;The 2003 version wasn't nearly as good but you still get the 1979 excellent version along with the 2003 so you can't lose!
25;The chemistry between Peter Falk and Alan Arkin is what makes this movie work.
26;Peter Falk and Alan Arkin made a great comedy team.
27;made lots of entertaining movies, but Arkin and Falk were extraordinary, and without the silliness that was so often part of the other comedy duos.
28;This movie has its moments, and Albert Brooks does great comedy.
29;Michael Douglas also did a credible job here.
30;Moderately entertaining, and your wife will like it for Michael Douglas.
31;both versions have comic merit.
32;It's fun, fast paced and funny overall.
33;Then it gets very fast and very funny.
34;I loved the original with Allan Alda nd Peter Falk, it is very funny.
35;were great in this movie.
36;Great and good for any family collection.
37;The movie plays very good.
38;One of the funniest movies I have seen.
39;The background music matches exactly with what is going on!
40;Michael Douglas made an outstanding performence, showed his depth of acting ability in playing so many sides to a charactor who indeed had many sides to his life.
41;The whole acting crew were perfectly matched to their roles.
42;Our family has enjoyed this film since the 80s.
43;The plot was hilarious, and Falk and Arkin performed brilliantly together!
44;It was comforting to know The In.
45;Both are entertaining, but I've yet to see a remake of a movie be better than the original version.
46;Call me corny but, if you've ever seen the original with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk, this is a great modern remake.
47;Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are the perfect foils for each other.
48;All I have to say is.
49;Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas are absolutely hilarious together.
50;Although the remake of In Laws is good, the original, with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin is definitely better.
51;So, I kept the tape.
52;One of the funniest movie lines ever.
53;and I've actually got flames on my car, because I love this movie so much!
54;My mother brought me to see the original movie when I was a kid!
55;My God, I loved this movie.
56;So this was a great way to see both and to compare.
57;Once she saw them both I think she agreed with me that the newer version is more fun, but you can be the judge of that.
58;My wife and I laughed so hard and so often.
59;and this was good clean humor.
60;I totally recommend this movie.
61;great for a date night flick.
62;The original is classic Peter Falk and Alan Arkin.
63;The best and the funniest version is with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin!
64;"like premise, combined with a stellar cast, is most likely to make ""The In."
65;office blockbuster of the summer.
66;The film's two main stars, Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, whose roles play off one another extremely well, you'd think they acted together previously.
67;Brooks' Felix character plays comic foil to Douglas's Oscar.
68;type persona, which provides great spontaneous comedy.
69;Steve Tobias (Douglas) is a rogue.
70;creating many memorable moments along their crazy journey.
71;The plot leaves behind many hilarious scenes in its wake.
72;The original was the best.
73;Falk and Arkin were delightful.
74;Douglas and Brooks did a good job but just not the same.
75;Two excellent comedy movies at a great price.
76;This movie was very funny and done very well by the actors.
77;I didn't see the original with Alan Arkin and Peter Faulk, so I have nothing to compare it with, but I thought this one was hilarious.
78;Loved the way Michael Douglas' hair never moved, no matter what he did!
79;Lots of zany laughs one would expect from Peter Faulk.
80;The first film was better than the Michael Douglas version
81;A must have for spy comedy lovers!
82;forget Columbo , get hold of some of his movies:a great and versatile actor.
83;almost as good as watching the movie.
84;This is a great set of films.
85;Really the two are the same film with twists.
86;laws run head to head and at odds of fantastic proportions.
87;Both films are in a class of their own.
88;The first Inlaws was hilarious.
89;So the 5 stars is for the original.
90;The 1979 version is wonderful and they did a fantastice job on the remake.
91;Ordered it and received it within 2 days, thank you.
92;I have watch this film from the time it came out in the movies.
93;the remake was funny but now as funny hey but i still laughed.
94;hey share it with your dentist.
95;Every line worked and the casting perfect.
96;This was an absolutely fantastic remake!
97;Of course, the original, with Falk and Arkin, is a great work.
98;Go see this fabulous remake!
99;I have absolutely insane In laws, So watching this film only reminded me of them!
100;This film made my wife and I laugh most of the way through it!
101;I highly recommend it to anyone who want a laugh about in laws!
102;Have always Loved loved loved this movie.
103;i always love michael douglas and ryan rynolds.
104;I have always liked it since I saw it a few years ago.
105;Now I can watch it anytime I desire.
106;I highly recommend this film for a good, funny, relaxing evening.
107;I think Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are the classic and the funniest, but not a bad remake enjoyed it too!
108;and how masterful the original.
109;"laws"", Alan Arkin and Peter Falk are flawless, and constitute one of the great film comedy duos, (right up there with their near."
110;"and the script by Andrew Bergman (who, let us not forget, had a hand in writing ""Blazing Saddles"") is a surprisingly sophisticated riot."
111;"laws"" is one of the top 20 comedies of all time, while the 2003 remake was shameful waste ot time, energy and money."
112;Because it is a comedy and nothing else.
113;funny for a plane .
114;But in spite of all the hullabaloo it is fun to have such a father and your bride is going to like every moment of it, especially when it goes with a lot of millions.
115;One thing is important anyway for you and you better remember it: a father is unique and you have to take it the way it is, the way it comes, the way HE makes himself available because no one can change a father.
116;He was fun to watch as a neurotic foot doctor learning how to live more fully thanks to the life style of Michael Douglas' character.
117;laws with Peter Falk has been one of my favorites for a lot of years.
118;Douglas, Brooks, and Candice Bergan manage to draw some laughs.
119;the film has its share of consistent moments.
120;The prime focus is on Douglas and Brooks whose children are going to be married.
121;The laughs are elicited by combining the two opposites .
122;Douglas as a fearless, deep undercover CIA agent and Brooks as a podiatrist who lives by the book.
123;He brings to every movie a fully.
124;There's considerable more emphasis placed on Brooks's daughter and Douglas's son.
125;"laws"" came out, and which are so familiar here that you'll laugh at the joke before it's even finished."
126;"I love this movie, I'm a huge fan of the ""Action."
127;"comedy"" genre, like: I Spy, Showtime, etc. and this movie fits that genre perfectly."
128;Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas have great chemistry, with Michael Douglas being an awesome spy and Albert Brooks playing his typical worrisome, always complaining character.
129;I enjoyed the movie .
130;Peter Faulk is always a winner in my experience.
131;He touches me somewhere inside both with his humorous and serious roles.
132;Fortunately, Michael Douglas carries his role well and Albert Brooks adeptly plays the role of the in.
133;Getting back to the story, the spy's son and the doctor's daughter are due to be married and the Douglas character is juggling the wedding preparations with his latest spy operation.
134;This can appear funny or unsettling, depending upon how one identifies with the characters.
135;He Made His Acting Look Effortless, And Carried The Movie The Way All Good Actors Do.
136;Fun for the whole family.
137;Full of comedy and action from the very start.
138;Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are extremely funny in this movie abouut a young couple whom plan to marry and their families meet.
139;You will have to see it for yourself it is absolutely funny.
140;kC and Sunshine band is the movie along with a few other well known actors.
141;I have seen it many times and have it on VHS.
142;the movies were great notwithstanding.
143;And Micheal Douglas is exceptionally funny in comic roles, even though most of his work is in drama and action movies.
144;I thought this movie was incredibly funny from start to finish.
145;Douglas and Brooks make an excellent team and I hope they make more movies together.
146;The similarities pretty much end there.
147;The original with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin was absolutely hilarious!
148;it was a funny movie, my girlfriend wanted me to watch it and I thought it was goin to be stupid but I ended up thinking it was pretty funny
149;There's only a couple of funny scenes.
150;No way will you guess, but the groom learns about honesty and why it's important.)
151;The direction is agreeable and the special effects / sets are pretty good.
152;About half of the actors do a good job, with Albert Brooks stealing the show completely.
153;This is good news, because it means that no matter who you are, you can at least give the movie a chance without being shocked by any nasty surprises or crude humor.
154;There is one shot of Brooks in a thong, but it's fleeting.
155;The movie is very funny and deserved better ratings by the critics.
156;I actually wanted the original movie of the In.
157;Peter Falk and Arkin are great together.
158;How fun to have both the original and the remake of a fun.
159;There are a few laughs but I have some advice.
160;No matter how many times you have seen it, the original is better!
161;It's hard to understand what the filmmakers hoped to accomplish with this film.
162;That film is still fresh and funny.
163;very entertaining, fun none thinking great charactors, albert brooks is a hoot.
164;The original movie had tracking issues throughout, finally came to a halt about halfway through.
165;So if you are in a mood to watch something fun with your family this is good.
166;all in all enjoyable but not memorable.
167;Douglas is an undercover CIA agent who lives on the edge and who has always interrupted family events in order to carry on his spying.
168;like actions are the perfect foil for the neurotic twitches of Brooks.
169;This is an amusing comedy which lives off the chemistry between Douglas and Brooks.
170;Throw away your critical eye and just enjoy this one for the laughs!
171;I found this movie to be hilarious!
172;One is an undercover member of the CIA.
173;Both of the stars are perfect for their roles.
174;Michael Douglas is really funny.
175;Albert Brooks is perfect for the role of the podiatrist.
176;He has the perfect voice for histarical yelling, as proven in this movie and in Finding Nemo.
177;A great comedy movie with a surprising comedic performance by my favorite actor, Michael Douglas.
178;Will keep you laughing the entire movie.
179;"In spite of the fact that this remake did not include the famous ""serpentine"" scene from the original movie, we loved it!"
180;We enjoyed the cast and thought the casting of Candace Bergen as mom in this dysFUNctional family was especially funny.
181;But I watched them both in sequence in a couple of days, starting with the 1979.
182;In my opinion, the 2003 version was a delight!
183;I'm really happy that I accidentally got the double.
184;but in my opinion I like it very much, and it a fun movie, the make itown porpouse, intreteinment.
185;Our children liked the new The In.
186;I loved finding this with both as now we can each watch the one we like better.
187;If you have seen the old and like it or just kind of liked it .
188;Quite a treat comparing the 2 versions .
189;good marketing ploy to sell both together.
190;I was quite surprised mid way through to find topless pictures of women on the walls when they were in a foreign country.
191;Rated PG I thought it would be fine.
192;A good movie is a like a good book, a means to escape.
193;Sometimes it's fun to watch a movie that is just pure entertainment and THE IN.
194;In fact, I laughed until I cried and trust me, it is wonderful to be that happy!
195;I probably won't watch the remake but it's worth it to have the original.
196;Some of this writing sticks with you, so that various scenes are brought to mind between friends, with just a simple reminder in conversation.
197;wheeling spy, this was a very fun movie.
198;It has comedy, some action, and some mild relationship stuff.
199;This is a remake if I remember right but very funny and underrated and for the most part unheard of.
200;Michael did an excellent job as an undercover CIA Agent and that made it exciting, and all the antics that Jerry and Steve had to go thru together.
201;The dynamic between the two characters is simply hysterical.
202;There is enough to keep you laughing and smirking through out the movie.
203;There are even some nice twists that kind of keep you guessing.
204;Sometimes expectations can ruin an otherwise good film.
205;I enjoyed both films, but the original will always be my favorite.
206;These are two very entertaining films.
207;This movie is so funny and entertaining I have watched it several times and at the dental office as well.
208;I love tis type of humor and it had me laughing the entire time.
209;great moveWonderful laughsHighly recommend this
210;This is one you can watch many times and enjoy.
211;The acting is superb, as usual, from these stars, but the story is a little slow developing.
212;Once the plot gets moving, it's very entertaining.
213;This is well worth watching.
214;better than most of today's movies.
215;very entertaining romp starring Alan Arkin and the late, great Peter Falk at their best.
216;A treat not to be missed.
217;this is a GREAT movie!
218;I received it in great shape and quickly.
219;I have always enjoyed watching Peter Falk.
220;He is a very good actor.
221;To me, this is one of the few times that both the original and the remake are quite good.
222;Personally, I prefer the Michael Douglas version to the Peter Falk version.
223;fetched, they are very entertaining.
224;Good all around movie some action, humor and a bit of excitement.
225;Peter Falk is absolutely fantastic in this movie.
226;The two of them make a great pair.
227;I have love this movie for years.
228;this is one wedding you will definitely not want to attend.
229;The best thing about the movie is Albert Brooks.
230;An example of an attempted humor is that woman who keeps kicking people or the heavy.
231;I have watched this movie so many times that I still crack up at certain parts especially when Albert Brooks decides to get in the hot tub!
232;Albert Brooks and Michael Douglass seem like an unlikely pair but truly are one of the funniest older men together I have ever seen!
233;The fun really starts at the wedding rehearsal where a surprise band starts to sing the first song the couple ever sang together.
234;Though the story does die down every once and awhile the most memorable and funny scenes are with Albert, Michael, ans Ryan Reynolds.
235;I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of comedy!
236;Michael Douglas and Al Brooks are hilarious in this film.
237;This movie is definitely a family favorite.
238;One of the few movies we will watch over and over again.
239;best movie I have seen in many years.
240;albert brooks in so damn funny , always enjoy his acting in comedys
241;This is one of our favorite movies.
242;Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks are a perfect match in this comedy.
243;The supporting cast is absolutely great as well.
244;I can watch this movie repeatedly and laugh like crazy.
245;I saw it in Singapore in June and laughed and then I saw it again last week in Moscow and laughed all over again.
246;I received the movie in a short amount of time.
247;Give it an extra star for trying, though as it did have a little suspense to it.
248;I found the original all by itself for the same price.
249;Ed Begly Jr. also appears and is very funny.
250;and I'd actually go watch Ed Wood's movies since Ed actually was excited to make a movie and put his heart and soul into them.
251;You will laugh through out the whole think.
252;I play it on my Kindle Fire and laugh though it every time I watch it.
253;the acting in this movie is awesome and there are some big named stars.
254;if you watch it, I hope you have as much fun watching it as I did.
255;cant remember his name right now.
256;are a good mix of personalities.
257;It is funny most of the way through.
258;The item came in perfect order.
259;Both versions were so much fun.
260;laws is the best and is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.
261;Alan Arkin and Peter Falk played their roles perfectly.
262;Both versions are great and worth comparing.
263;I remembered the first version with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk from years ago when I first enjoyed seeing that movie, and was equally impressed with the new version with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks where the storyline has been brought up to modern day.
264;David Suchet (from the Poirot series) is fantastic as the villain.
265;I thought it was hilarious.
266;plenty of fun and outrageous scenes.
267;a movie I can watch many, many times and still laugh and not be bored/tired of it.
268;highly under rated in my opinion.
269;I always thought the originalwas the best.
270;I found this movie extremely entertaining.
271;"I saw Brooks in ""Mother"" and thought he was hilarious."
272;I loved it so much that I went back to my video library and watched it again.
273;To me, movies are also made to entertain and give people a few moments of fun.
274;To me, a good movie can be deep or can simply take you away from your routine for over an hour and relax you.
275;i highly recommend this movie.
276;Watch it and have fun!
277;"Watch it as it is and appreciate its entertaining value!If you like Brooks and want a deep look into characters, human complexity and an interesting analysis of relationships, watch ""Mother'."
278;Watched it with family who had not yet viewed.
279;Now, another one comes starring Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, a buddy.
280;but the comic pair of Douglas and Brooks work up to a point, and there are funny scenes surrounding Brooks and Suchet, even though it's just another gay joke (which is done well in itself).
281;When Brooks is on the screen, you can say that he gives every scene a great comic touch, with perfect comic timing.
282;wife of Douglas character, in particular.
283;This is a light, breezy comedy which is a remake of the 1979 film of the same name.
284;The original film relied on the cleverness of the plot and the dry comedic talents of Falk and Arkin combined with the chemistry between them which developed on the screen.
285;there are enough funny lines (with a few really hilarious sequences) and the pace is fast enough to make the film enjoyable light entertainment.
286;If you have seen the trailers or even just the TV ads, this is one film where they accurately represent its nature.
287;I love the original movie.
288;This is not rocket science, but it certainly was fun!
289;This is one of those movies that have the rare combination of chemistry, timing, and line delivery that just works.
290;It is just funny and memorable and a refreshing change.
291;The story line is simple yet the characters were wonderfully developed.
292;This is a timeless movie that should be part of everyone's collection.2003 In.
293;I ABSOLUTELY love this Peter Falk/ Alan Arkin version.
294;This is a very funny movie.
295;The original, with Peter Falk was great, but I feel that this one is even better.
296;Michael Douglas is great in his role.
297;Put this one on your list if you like a good comedy.
298;He was telling our grand kids how funny it was.
299;It was just as funny now as I had remembered it, and my son agreed.
300;The grand kid got a big kick out of the way the dentist kept getting into trouble.
301;Peter and Alan did an awesome acting job.
