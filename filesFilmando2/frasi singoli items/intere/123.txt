I:11308;1;I love Tatum O'Neal, she earned a best supporting actress oscar at ten (the youngest to win).
I:11308;2;Ryan O'Neal is great too even though I don't respect the guy too much off.
I:11308;3;camera but Paper Moon is a timeless tale of a little orphaned girl who believes the man she traveling with is really her father.
I:11308;4;Who knows if he really is but Paper Moon is a landmark in filmmaking, excellent direction by Peter Bogdanovich.
I:11308;5;Paper Moon is filmed in black and white, perfect for the time this movie is set in.
I:11308;6;I highly recommend this gem of a film.
I:11308;7;This is a classic, deliciously funny movie set in the FDR era Mid.
I:11308;8;this is like watching I Love Lucy, you can see it a million times and still laugh as hard each time.
I:11308;9;The film was presented very well and is funny, although, it's petty crime that was being glorified, and involving a minor at that.
I:11308;10;But it's her dad who steals the show here.
I:11308;11;He nails every scene just right, especially once he takes up with Miss Trixie.
I:11308;12;She has a high school diploma! )
I:11308;13;moving film by today's standards, and not afraid to let silence to the talking from time to time.
I:11308;14;My girlfriend would usually rather watch Jersey Shore than anything but she fell in love with the smart.
I:11308;15;I thought it was a great period film.
I:11308;16;Anyway, she does an amazing job.
I:11308;17;Truly one of my favorite films of all time, `Paper Moon' deserves a spot in the catalogues of time as one of the best films ever made concerning the important relationship that buds between a father and daughter.
I:11308;18;I am moved to feel so many differing emotions when watching this delightful film.
I:11308;19;"I laugh, I cry
I:11308;20;At her mother's funeral she meets Moses Pray, a man who very well may be her father, even if he won't consider the possibility.
I:11308;21;Along the way they pick up dancer Trixie Delight and her side.
I:11308;22;The rapport between this real life father and daughter team (Ryan and Tatum O'Neal) is beyond words really.
I:11308;23;They have such undeniable chemistry and they make each scene a delight to watch.
I:11308;24;This is most definitely a career highlight for both actors, and the roles they will be remembered for forever.
I:11308;25;Watching the progression of character on screen is such a joy, seeing them work from resentment and reluctance to admiration and respect to eventual love and embracement.
I:11308;26;both Madeline Kahn and P. j. Johnson also turn in wonderful supporting turns, complete with not only comedic timing but a pure sense of humanity that makes them so remarkably touching.
I:11308;27;Kahn is a superb actress who relates very well with O'Neal here (both O'Neal's, but most effectively Tatum), which makes for some very moving and memorable scenes.
I:11308;28;`Paper Moon' is a technical marvel as well, shot in pristine sepia (black and white with a red filter), a decision that adds an almost earthy tone to the film (thank you Orson Welles).
I:11308;29;Director Peter Bogdanovich should be commended for drawing out such a phenomenal performance from Tatum, a feat I hear was quite difficult for the director.
I:11308;30;What he gets from her, and his entire cast really, is nothing short of remarkable.
I:11308;31;Not only is `Paper Moon' an actors showcase and a delicate character study, but it has all the necessary elements (comedy, drama, action, suspense) to constitute it one of the most complete films I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
I:11308;32;"and then 1973's ""Paper Moon,"" a thoroughly clever, engagingly sharp period comedy adapted from the novel ""Addie Pray"" by Joe David Brown."
I:11308;33;Focusing on a slick, small.
I:11308;34;And now the good stuff starts.
I:11308;35;the surprise, of course, is neophyte Tatum O'Neal, Ryan's real.
I:11308;36;curse a sailor, the Oscar.
I:11308;37;winning Tatum steals practically every scene she's in.
I:11308;38;A cross between Little Orphan Annie and Wallace Beery, she lights up the screen so naturally and unaffectedly.
I:11308;39;voiced Kahn, an expert comedy farceur, will keep you rolling in the aisles as she barnstorms her way right into Moze's front seat while disrupting the team's money.
I:11308;40;"Careful attention has been paid to the look and feel of this film, which is greatly enhanced by the stunning midwest landscape (shot impressively, like ""The Last Picture Show"", in black."
I:11308;41;perfect incidentals, which give the film a wonderfully authentic 30s feel.
I:11308;42;"So, perhaps in retrospect, ""Paper Moon"" becomes a wonderful valentine to better days and a loving tribute to a once budding genius."
I:11308;43;Would recommend watching and looking beyond the black and white picture!
I:11308;44;What a refreshing Movie, no sex or bad language, just heartfelt and interesting, sure kept my interest.
I:11308;45;I would recommend this to everyone.
I:11308;46;The father and daughter thing works out perfectly.
I:11308;47;They are such a good team.
I:11308;48;This movie is thoroughly enjoyable.
I:11308;49;This little comedy is a delight for the whole family.
I:11308;50;This is a great movie .
I:11308;51;Tatum O'Neal thoroughly deserved the Oscar she won.
I:11308;52;I saw this as a kid, and just rewatched it.
I:11308;53;Tatum O'Neal won the Oscar (at 10 years.
I:11308;54;old) for best supporting actress.
I:11308;55;She's the star of the film, for sure.
I:11308;56;After you watch it, read some biographical stuff on Tatum, and you'll appreciate the movie (and the relationship between Ryan and Tatum in the movie) all the more.
I:11308;57;competence watch, not just a good movie.
I:11308;58;Bob Young, who plays the gas station attendant, was one of my best friends.
I:11308;59;Thus, I liked the film before ever seeing it.
I:11308;60;that aside, the movie is interesting for several reasons.
I:11308;61;directed, and convincingly acted by Ryan and Tatum Oneal.
I:11308;62;Madeline Kahn is her usual brilliant self as Trixie Delight.
I:11308;63;But Addie, wise for her age, knows when doing so is not appropriate and manages the situation.
I:11308;64;On their travels across Kansas and into Missouri, the two meet up with moonshiners, lawmen, and other notable characters.
I:11308;65;Even if I didn't have personal reasons for liking it, I would recommend it highly.
I:11308;66;It's a film to enjoy over and over again.
I:11308;67;love that it shot in black and white throughout the movie.
I:11308;68;This film is a true classic.
I:11308;69;Although the Oscar (well deserved) went to young Tatum O'Neal for her stunning performance as Addie Loggins, it seems the equally strong performance by her father, Ryan O'Neal, as Moses Pray was overlooked by the Academy.
I:11308;70;it will make for a fun Saturday afternoon for the whole family!
I:11308;71;A masterpiece of acting, staging and tone.
I:11308;72;Charming, hilarious, sly, surprising and poignant.
I:11308;73;A marvel, a pure delight.
I:11308;74;In my opinion, he is superb in this film.
I:11308;75;Amazing the chemistry between Ryan and Tatum.
I:11308;76;A wonderfully entertaining movie set in the 1930's in Kansas.
I:11308;77;man who gets roped into transporting a 9.
I:11308;78;Tatum is wise beyond her years and the two team up in scams on the road.
I:11308;79;They have their adventures and grow to love and need each other.
I:11308;80;It's a fun picture, with the '30's setting perfectly captured in music and great b&w photography.
I:11308;81;Excellent acting (especially by Tatum O'Neal), funny, and meticulous attention to detail from the period in which it happened were all excellent!
I:11308;82;The music and radio shows throughout the movie were definitely accurate.
I:11308;83;one of our best american films.
I:11308;84;Paper Moon, directed by Joe Bogdanovich and adapted from the novel Addie Pray by Joe Brown, is one of my favorite movies.
I:11308;85;It manages to be funny and serious at the same time.
I:11308;86;The humor and acting is timeless.
I:11308;87;tatum is absolutely marvelous as Addie.
I:11308;88;This is the best performance I've seen from a child actor.
I:11308;89;She is funny, intelligent and headstrong.
I:11308;90;Her facial expressions through out the movie are hilarious.
I:11308;91;It's remarkable how well she acted at such a young age.
I:11308;92;She certainly gives her more experienced father a run for his money.
I:11308;93;Her performance is by far the best in the entire film.
I:11308;94;kahn and Ryan also give stellar performances.
I:11308;95;Kahn is spectacular as an exotic dancer who tries to appear as innocent as possible.
I:11308;96;Her best scene takes place on the hill when Addie refuses to get back in the car.
I:11308;97;She is funny and heartbreaking.
I:11308;98;It's no wonder she's one of the funniest comedic actresses of all time (in my opinion).
I:11308;99;He brings out the human side of his character.
I:11308;100;The decision to make the film black and white really allows me to suspend belief.
I:11308;101;I can truly imagine that the movie was shot in the 1930s.
I:11308;102;The scenic shots of the countryside are also beautiful.
I:11308;103;"There are also plenty of one liners that are hilarious
I:11308;104;It's a film that you can watch over and over and always find something new to laugh at.
I:11308;105;I highly recommend this movie.
I:11308;106;Ryan and Tatum both gave outstanding performances.
I:11308;107;I love these movies that give us a look into the way life was during the depression and that era.
I:11308;108;I have always loved this movie.
I:11308;109;This is a great film that has been given excellent treatment in the transfer and packaging.
I:11308;110;I've not watched the extras, but the feature is a wonderful story from the Depression.
I:11308;111;Beautiful black and white, silver.
I:11308;112;The music is wonderful, but not in the bluegrass vein, for the most part.
I:11308;113;The scenary is spectacular, and makes you feel like you're in the depression era.
I:11308;114;Though whimsical for the most part, the movie also shows what life was like during the depression years.
I:11308;115;I won't answer the first two, and I don't know about the third one, but I'm hopeful (smiling)This movie has a bit of strong language and some racy dialogue, but overall this is a superb film and cool to watch
I:11308;116;"Charming and sweet, a lovely tale filled with fun and silliness
I:11308;117;we loved it and I know our entire family would too.
I:11308;118;It held my interest, wasn't too sappy.
I:11308;119;I found this movie to be very entertaining.
I:11308;120;The rural setting and scenery of the 1930's was also a treat.
I:11308;121;Wonderful Acting and wonderful Story Narration.
I:11308;122;a Very Heart Warming and lovely movie !
I:11308;123;Must see for all ages !
I:11308;124;This is a classic great movie that every adult should see at least once, and will probably want to see again and again.
I:11308;125;The smoking scene was a bit shocking to me but the movie is just so telling of the times and so entertaining and just grabs your heart.
I:11308;126;Great, great movie and I am very picky.
I:11308;127;It would be nice to be able to rate a program like this with stars, without having to go on about why.
I:11308;128;I love little Tatum Oneil she is so cute!
I:11308;129;Paper Moon is the definition of charm.
I:11308;130;It's one of the very few films that could be called a flawless 70's gem, right alongside Harold and Maude.
I:11308;131;The story of a con artist named Moses Pray and his supposed daughter scheming their way across the Midwest is kind of like taking the basis of Bonnie and Clyde and applying it to a 1930's Frank Capra film.
I:11308;132;The main focus is always on the blossoming relationship between the couple of con artists, which is almost infectious in its charm.
I:11308;133;The chemistry between Ryan O'Neal and his real life daughter Tatum is truly something special.
I:11308;134;Tatum, who had no acting experience prior to filming, is a marvel.
I:11308;135;She understands the comedy, she gets the manipulation, and she most importantly knows she's playing a little girl in a situation usually reserved for adults, and she perfectly demonstrates all of this knowledge with a surprisingly nuanced and lovable performance.
I:11308;136;The black and white photography mixed with the country setting make for a spare yet undeniably beautiful recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age filmmaking.
I:11308;137;An added bonus is a hysterical turn from Madeline Kahn as the gold.
I:11308;138;Paper Moon is a movie that could be watched a dozen times and still be enjoyed.
I:11308;139;It's iconic yet modest, a warm masterpiece made for summer nights.
I:11308;140;A old movie but a very good one.
I:11308;141;Nice movie for family movie night
I:11308;142;"Producer and director Peter Bogdanovich created a visually stunning panorama of sprawling Midwestern landscapes with some marvelous black and white cinematography in his excellent comedic drama ""Paper Moon""."
I:11308;143;They encounter a colorful cast of characters along the way, most notably Madeline Kahn playing dancer/hooker Trixie Delight.
I:11308;144;She soon begins to compete with Addie for Mose's attention.
I:11308;145;He skillfully guides his characters across this landscape, allowing them to create minor mayhem along the way.
I:11308;146;This is such a wonderful movie.
I:11308;147;Everyone that I know who has ever seen it has loved it.
I:11308;148;It was fun to visit the hotel.
I:11308;149;the movie was fun to watch.
I:11308;150;a wonderful film in many respects and gets my highest rating.
I:11308;151;The story doesn't lose any steam during the entire film and there are lots of great performances including the one by Tatum O'Neil who won an Oscar for her supporting role.
I:11308;152;From that point on the Addie is convinced that they belong together, and the relationship works great magic through the rest of the movie.
I:11308;153;Madeline Kahn also helps make this a very entertaining movie.
I:11308;154;the attention to detail of the period with the music, costumes and props make it a feast for the eyes and ears.
I:11308;155;It was also filmed in black and white and for being set in the Depression Era, it works quite well.
I:11308;156;relief caricatures.You could look at 'Paper Moon' as a charming buddy.
I:11308;157;any way you look at it, 'Paper Moon' is marvellous, and a reminder of how brilliant Ryan O'Neal could be.
I:11308;158;Superb direction by Peter Bogdanovich, an excellent Oscar nominated script by Alvin Sargent, great depression era atmosphere distinguished by the production design by Bogdanovich's then wife Polly Platt and an impeccable song score.
I:11308;159;It's the performances by the cast that is the film's greatest attribute.
I:11308;160;"What I do disagree with is why she won in a supporting role and not in the lead actress category(Glenda Jackson won for ""A Touch of Class""."
I:11308;161;Tatum at the tender age of nine shows a maturity and guile well beyond her years.
I:11308;162;Ryan O'Neal contributes probably his best performance ever.
I:11308;163;The supporting cast which includes the Oscar nominated Madeline Kahn as a dancehall girl and John Hillerman as a bootlegger and his sadistic sheriff brother are also outstanding.
I:11308;164;This movie entertained me years ago, and even my young daughters enjoyed it.
I:11308;165;When a movie can be entertaining through the generational gap, you know it is a classic!
I:11308;166;I really love this movie, the relationship between Ryan and Tatum was awesome.
I:11308;167;She was a good child actor, and cute
I:11308;168;This film gives us wonderful visuals in a way that could only have been done at (or after) this time in black and white.
I:11308;169;There are some very funny moments, with Ryan O'Neal's con.
I:11308;170;Ryan's daughter Tatum plays the orphan he takes with him for the ride, and she plays this well, despite the script giving her lines that seem a little too adult from a nine year.
I:11308;171;observed and very amusing performance as a tart.
I:11308;172;selected period music combined with a stunning array of costumes give this an authentic, depression era feel.

I:11308;175;Their scenes in the car are so hilarious and endearing that you'd wish you could ride with them for hours longer.

I:11308;194;A classic from the nineteen sixties.
I:11308;195;The main stars work very well together.
I:11308;196;You will love the time period of 1933

I:11308;198;old Addie Loggins is the centerpiece of Peter Bogdanovich's affectionate 1973 comedy set during the depths of the Great Depression.

I:11308;200;the rest of the story is an entertaining road movie centered on the evolving relationship between Moses and Addie as she shows to have a greater gift for scams than he does.
I:11308;201;As Addie, Tatum O'Neal still has the distinction of being the youngest actor to win a competitive Oscar, and in her film debut, her unprecocious performance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child.
I:11308;202;Almost as funny is the eye.
I:11308;203;First, Bogdanovich offers a full.
I:11308;204;length commentary full of his personal remembrances and sharing a deep well of cinematic knowledge.
I:11308;205;My daughter was very satisfied with the movie.
I:11308;206;A good film for when you're not in the mood for war, murder, or deep drama.
I:11308;207;It has just the right balance of pathos and humor.
I:11308;208;Tatem O'Neal really is a great actress and so young!
I:11308;209;I would see this movie again and again.
I:11308;210;Great to watch with the entire family.
I:11308;211;Father and daughter duo worked phenomenal in this flick.
I:11308;212;Here we watch the magic of two fine actors at their best.
I:11308;213;I saw this on its first release, remembered it fondly, and appreciated this opportunity to see it again.
I:11308;214;Glad I did, she loved it and of course it was a treat to see it again.
I:11308;215;Tatum O'Neal is cute as hell and steals the show with her quick wit, foul mouth while keeping her innocence as a kid.
I:11308;216;Ryan did a great job staying in character as a crooked salesman, who learned he could take a few pointers from his much younger sidekick.
I:11308;217;Very entertaining and a must see!
I:11308;218;i saw this when it first came out and liked it alot its funny, whitty ,adventurous, keeps you wondering whats coming around the corner next,fantastic period detail .

I:11308;220;with the family team, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil, and fell in love with this charming and touching road movie/comedy that takes place during the Great Depression.
I:11308;221;Tatum gave, perhaps, one of the best performances by a child I've seen for which she received the Academy award as Best Supporting Actress.
I:11308;222;"Her Addie is almost never cute (even though she could be when she wanted to) but her Addie is very smart, very observant, and much better ""con artist"" than ""professional"" Moses Pray."

I:11308;224;I really enjoyed watching this again!
I:11308;225;Overall it was a moderately good movie.
I:11308;226;This movie showed up as a recommendation.

I:11308;228;The storytelling was impeccable both visually and structurally.
I:11308;229;Ryan is great but Tatum steals the show.
I:11308;230;Very well made and a fun story.

I:11308;242;Not only does she suspect the man is her real father but in real life, the man is the father of the child actor, which adds a chemistry to their arguments that is simply hilarious and genuine.
I:11308;243;The body language she portrays is genuine and wonderful to watch .
I:11308;244;With a subtle directorial hand, Peter Bogdanovich just let his thespians do their jobs here, and thus they carried the whole film into the amazingly charming entertainment that it is today.

I:11308;258;Most hilariously, they pick up exotic dancer (and sometimes lady of evening leisure) Miss Trixie Delight, played with bounce and sass by the late great comedienne Madeline Kahn.
I:11308;259;"director of Photography Laszlo Kovacs invests the movie with gorgeous black and white cinematography that recalls John Ford's movie version of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in the portrayal of the dustbowl Midwest, of Walker Evans' photographs in capturing the Victorian architecture of the movie's few well."
I:11308;260;This one is Bogdanovich's best directorial effort and a fun movie to sit down, munch on popcorn to and have a lot of laughs.
I:11308;261;As many times as I have viewed it over the years it has remained as charming and delightful as the first time.
I:11308;262;I've always loved this movie for many obvious reasons (great script, director, and actors), but there are other reasons I love this movie that I could never express.
I:11308;263;It's like appreciating a great piece of music by Mozart but not knowing why the work had such a great effect on me.
I:11308;264;I believe this movie is truly one of Bogdanovich's masterworks.
I:11308;265;A real study of human nature and codependency.
I:11308;266;I have seen this movie many times and continue to love it!
I:11308;267;Good and enjoyable but may not be for kids.
I:11308;268;Sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy.
I:11308;269;The characters were absolutely believable and they take you on a thrilling ride across Kansas in the '30's.
I:11308;270;It's a pretty good movie, with a pretty decent story telling.
I:11308;271;Acting is pretty good, but seriously nothing about it is outstanding, and a story telling maybe isn't really that good either .
I:11308;272;you can tell it's made to fit the inspiration, instead of pursuing the illusive something.
I:11308;273;But there's a very particular pacing to the movie that's comforting, and exactly that pace that is very rare in today's movies, which is what I really like.
I:11308;274;My wife and I enjoyed this movie.
I:11308;275;This is a delight (no pun intended) to watch over and over again.
I:11308;276;The period music is as interesting as any of it.
I:11308;277;Give it at listen at [.]
I:11308;278;in my view this is Mr. Bogdanovich's sweet and savory masterpiece, the best he's done.
I:11308;279;I have always loved this movie, it always makes me smile!
I:11308;280;I haven't seen this movie, but my 12 year old daughter says it is the best movie she's ever seen.
I:11308;281;Great film but tatum was not a sup actress in this one she was the lead so how does she merit a sup actress award?
I:11308;282;Ryan should have received a nomination.
I:11308;283;Oscar ya got it wrong still a timeless classic
I:11308;284;the movie itself is charming,with Ryan O'neal and his young daughter 'Tatum' in her film debut.
I:11308;285;But I will say that it must be in your collection.
I:11308;286;Best character actors and a great story.
I:11308;287;This is a film you will watch again and again!
I:11308;288;This is truly a work from the heart.
I:11308;289;A true family affair, as father and daughter work as a team to bring a real uplifting, and occasionally very sad, story of a man who needs a woman to share his life.
I:11308;290;white and is carried out so perfectly that the vintage look is right at home.
I:11308;291;A simple, subtle movie with some hilarious moments including a lusty Madeline Kahn.
I:11308;292;I've been a fan of Tatum O Neil since 'Little Darlings' stole my heart many years ago.
I:11308;293;A truly beautiful and talented actress.
I:11308;294;An honest and sentimental film for all ages.
I:11308;295;This movie was just as good the second time around!
I:11308;296;I was thrilled to see it as an option on Prime!
I:11308;297;Paper Moon is without a doubt Ryan O'Neal's best performance.
I:11308;298;His daughter Tatum absolutely STEALS the show.
I:11308;299;But Paper Moon will always be one of my favorites.
I:11308;300;All the sets, costumes, and music authenticate this.
I:11308;301;I also adore Madeline Khan and Trixie Delight IS a delight.
I:11308;302;This movie is in my top twenty and I recommend it as a must own.
I:11308;303;I saw this movie when it was released in 1973, and it still holds up as a nostalgic look at the early 30's depression period.
I:11308;304;The background music is especially classic, which was then released as a long.
I:11308;305;The entire movie is a little quirky but compellingly funny, supported by outstanding performances from the cast.
I:11308;306;A great movie for young and old alike.
I:11308;307;this is one movie you can see again and again and still enjoy it.

I:11308;312;Tatum became youngest player ever to win an Oscar.
I:11308;313;Brilliant and memorable classic and what a performance by Tatum O Neil , she really held nothing back and was a perfect match for her fellow actor and father Ryan O Neil, in this era of poverty and desperation the duo set about to make a living by their con jobs and bluff.
I:11308;314;A memorable and worth watching over and over again film for sure.
I:11308;315;Tatum O'Neal carries this movie with her nonchalance, intelligence, and expressive demeanor.
I:11308;316;There is not much to be learned from it, but the unexpected twists and turns and the sheer delight the acting make it a an enjoyable experience, to be repeated every so often.
I:11308;317;Paper Moon is a classic, and a well kept secret.
I:11308;318;the price was great, and I received it very quickly!
I:11308;319;Engaging, funny, pulls the heartstrings.
I:11308;320;Tatum O'Neal's first movie and she totally owns it!
I:11308;321;A movie about a con man (Moses Pray) and his daughter Addie Pray as they tour the country ripping people of with their various schemes.
I:11308;322;And excellent performance by the O'Neals (Ryan and Tatum).
I:11308;323;Paper Moon was a fun throwback to a time when iPods weren't heard of and the radio was at the heart of family entertainment.
I:11308;324;The pace is a lot slower than films today .
I:11308;325;It's in black and white, and is an adventure, relationship movie that's really worth seeing.
I:11308;326;I discovered this funny gem a few years ago and haven't been able to stop watching it.
I:11308;327;The humor is subtle and hilarious, the acting superb.

I:11308;329;If you enjoy tales of lovable con.
I:11308;330;artists, this is definitely for you.
I:11308;331;One of the best films .
I:11308;332;Funny, touching, exciting and well written it explores the relationship between a very savvy young girl and a con artist that may or may not be her father.
I:11308;333;Set in the depression, the film really seems to capture the culture of the era .
I:11308;334;cars, language, music and how people struggled to survive.
I:11308;335;I remember that Madeline Khan stole my breath away from laughing so much, and the movie stole my heart.
I:11308;336;I enjoyed watching this movie it was light and fun and will be happy to spend another evening watching the antics of these two again
I:11308;337;What a fun, sweet, thoroughly enjoyable family movie.
I:11308;338;west and surviving a series of hilarious misadventures, Addie and Moses develop a genuine affection for each other, and learn the true meaning of what it is to be a family.
I:11308;339;ryan and Tatum O'Neal both give outstanding performances as the erstwhile father and daughter.
I:11308;340;In fact, Tatum won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in PAPER MOON, the youngest actress to do so.
I:11308;341;"Other cast members, including Madeline Kahn and John Hillerman are equal to the task
I:11308;342;The chemistry between all of the characters is genuine and very believable.
I:11308;343;the black and white print adds to authentic feel of the film.
I:11308;344;Costuming, sets, and locations are all dead.
I:11308;345;This really puts the viewer there, in the movie, in the story.
I:11308;346;full of a wonderfully effective combination of sentimentality, humor, and cynicism, PAPER MOON stands the test of time.
I:11308;347;Watch this film with your family.
I:11308;348;I guarantee, no matter what the age, everyone will enjoy the evening.
I:11308;349;"In fact, my oldest enjoyed this film so much that she ""forgot it was in black and white."""
I:11308;350;i've seen it many times and I love Tatum o Neil, she's adorable and a great actress.
I:11308;351;Fun to see a black and white movie again.
I:11308;352;Great acting by all cast members.
I:11308;353;Skipped that scene and the next scene also messed up.
I:11308;354;it sucked as this was one of my favorite movies growing up and would have like to have in my collection.
I:11308;355;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:11308;356;She steals the show as a hard.

I:11308;358;time con artist and an ornery orphan, but it's presented with charm and delight.
I:11308;359;peter Bogdonavich delightfully captures the feel of the era, shooting in black and white, using art deco graphics.
I:11308;360;loud laughs, but a lot of heart.
I:11308;361;this is one of the best ever.
I:11308;362;this is must see classic stuff.
I:11308;363;In the 1970s, director, Peter Bogdanovich was at the top of his game contributing a number of classics to that particular golden age of filmmaking.
I:11308;364;His masterpiece of course was the brilliant movie, The Last Picture Show , which deserves all its accolades.
I:11308;365;but one film, which I do not feel has recieved its proper due, is his wonderful nostalgic comedy, Paper Moon .
I:11308;366;this is among one of the best comedies to come out of the early '70s.
I:11308;367;But soon he discovers that Addie is smart and just as good a con.
I:11308;368;Bogdanovich has created a wonderful nostalgic film that is full of both humor and pathos.
I:11308;369;but their is also a certain melancholic atmosphere, throughout the movie as Bogdonovich shows us a rural America, which has been descimated by the effects of the dustbowl and the Depression.
I:11308;370;this is greatly aided and highlighted by Cinematographer, Laszlo Kovacs's brilliantly stark, black white photography.
I:11308;371;the photography along with the costumes, set design and music give this film a really authentic feel for the 1930s era.
I:11308;372;the acting in this movie is first rate!
I:11308;373;Father/daughter acting team of Ryan Tatum O'Neal are fantastic in their comic screen roles, giving probably the best performances of both their careers.
I:11308;374;compliments should also go to actress, Madeline Kahn for her wonderful supporting role as Miss Trixie Delight, a hilarious carney hootchie.
I:11308;375;This is a great classic movie of the '70s, which will give you hours of entertainment!
I:11308;376;The early successes of director Peter Bogdanovich .
I:11308;377;ended in 1973 with an evocative and endearing comedy.

I:11308;379;The small cast of actors all give memorable performances.
I:11308;380;old newcomer Tatum O'Neal as the orphan, who is on the screen nearly constantly and basically carries the whole film.
I:11308;381;She imbues every scene with the right emotions, convictions, world.
I:11308;382;weariness, precociousness, and understated pathos and comedy.
I:11308;383;It is a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a character that probably should have been played by a slightly older actress (in the original novel, it is a 12.

I:11308;389;Also astonishing is that the film's wonderful ending did not come to him until almost at the end of the shooting.

I:11308;398;This still works great 40 years later.
I:11308;399;Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's a film full of smiles and laughs,a lot of heart, but very little sticky sweetness.
I:11308;400;a low level grifter (Ryan O'Neal) gets stuck with taking a tough as nails orphaned 9 year old (O'Neal's real 'life daughter Tatum, in an astonishing performance for a kid that age .

I:11308;402;"Along the way they get into all sorts of misadventures, and meet numerous characters,including a wonderfully funny Madeline Kahn as an exotic dancer named ""Trixie Delight"", and John Hillermandoing his usual excellent low key work in a double role as a bootlegger and his sheriff brother."
I:11308;403;bogdanovich gets to the essence of what was best about 30s comedies, without being a slave to it.
I:11308;404;one of those comedies you can watch over and over again.
I:11308;405;I remember seeing this film back in the early 70s and was mesmerized by the 1930s visual and aural feel of the film and the emotional dynamic of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal.
I:11308;406;A delightful story that takes place in the middle of the Depression in middle America, Paper Moon is the story of a father/daughter con artist team (Moses Pray/Addie Loggins) who go from town to town swindling people in an outlandish yet believable manner, and in the process both develop a need for one another that goes beyond the financial.
I:11308;407;Tatum O'Neal's ability to emote her feelings through her simple yet powerful facial expressions and her intelligent dialogue is so convincing that you see her subtlely transform from a seemingly innocent child to a worldly adult who understands human nature just as much as the grown.
I:11308;408;Tatum's portrayal of Addie is truly uncanny and what makes it so poignant is the fact that she had no formal training as an actress prior to the movie's production.
I:11308;409;this movie is also the high.
I:11308;410;Bogdonovich's directorial efforts provide seamless continuity, and the film retains its simple yet evocative feel.
I:11308;411;This is truly one of the best low.
I:11308;412;key comedy/drama classics ever and am surprised it has not received the recognition of artistry it truly deserves.
I:11308;413;This is a wonderful, refreshing movie!
I:11308;414;A must see for all ages!
I:11308;415;Paper Moon is my favorite movie.
I:11308;416;Little Tatum O Neal was such a great actress in the movie.
I:11308;417;I liked it being in black and white .
I:11308;418;Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are fun to watch and are a perfect pair.
I:11308;419;As well as Madeline Kahn for supporting actress.
I:11308;420;She brings her fine assets to the big screen.
I:11308;421;Great fun and a timeless classic.
I:11308;422;This excellent little film from director Peter Bogdanovich is very funny, very entertaining and just an all.
I:11308;423;It is very stylish and has great atmosphere.
I:11308;424;The plan is to make a few bucks through blackmail with her and then send her on a train to her Aunts but through various events and circumstances they find out that they are a pretty good pair of hustlers.
I:11308;425;the acting is the film's greatest virtue.
I:11308;426;Ryan and Tatum O'Neal both do excellent jobs with their roles.
I:11308;427;They play off of each other perfectly, creating some very funny scenes purely through looks or a feeling between the two.
I:11308;428;Madeline Kahn is hilarious as a prostitute that Ryan picks up along the way.
I:11308;429;She plays the perfect floozy and has a great scene with Tatum on a hill.
I:11308;430;It gives the whole film an old.
I:11308;431;The film feels like the 1930's and that adds a nice touch.
I:11308;432;"it's no ""The Last Picture Show"" but still defiantly worth a viewing from anybody who likes movies."
I:11308;433;a young Peter Bogdanovich so far surpassed all contemporaries with this lovely, poignant movie.
I:11308;434;the Script itself is outstanding, the choice of actors who brilliantly fit the georgraphy and the period.
I:11308;435;"The haunting period references, ""Fibber McGee"", George and Gracie, Movies of the period, the lustful desk clerk identifying himself to Madeleine Khan as ""The Sheik of Araby""."
I:11308;436;When it came out, saw it, liked it, forgot it.
I:11308;437;Hundreds of thousands of movies later, I was enthralled from the start by Peter Bogandanovitch's gorgeous black and white photography of the plains during the depression.
I:11308;438;but the photography is outclassed by probably Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's best roles and acting ever.
I:11308;439;Since the plot concerns her paternity, it's wonderful to watch them bicker over it, and for him to so often be outsmarted (for his own good) by Addie.
I:11308;440;watch it just for the beauty of the photography, enjoy the story as well.
I:11308;441;"(As with many other reviewers, I agree that Tatum O'Neal deserved to be nominated as a ""best"" rather than ""supporting"" actress.)"
I:11308;442;Without a scintilla of sentimentality, the film still has enormous warmth, charm and even grace.
I:11308;443;Either way it's a treat.
I:11308;444;This is a wonderful film.
I:11308;445;This is a most endearing film, even though it was made in the 1970s (I believe).
I:11308;446;A black and white movie with Ryan O'Neal and his then very young daughter, Tatum, who was superb.
I:11308;447;west during the 1920s and scammed the locals, flimflammed the shopkeepers, and stealing from a bootlegger.
I:11308;448;The scenery, costumes, and surrounding were very well done in the period.
I:11308;449;I really liked this movie.
I:11308;450;It is good to see a movie with out all the gun shooting and violence.
I:11308;451;but you have to be nice to be a con artist.
I:11308;452;A particularly humorous interlude comes when Moze is captivated by a hoochie.
I:11308;453;coochie dancer, played con brio by the marvelous Madeline Kahn and offers her and her maid a ride.
I:11308;454;"Addie and ""Trixie Delight's"" maid Imogene bring the interlude to a satisfying conclusion."
I:11308;455;"it's excellent
I:11308;456;What a great and fun movie!
I:11308;457;"Tatum O'Neal steals the show here
I:11308;458;Adults and kids can enjoy this together without much fear of the admittedly seedy subject matter .
I:11308;459;The soundtrack is comprised of Thirties pop radio standards that fit perfectly without calling too much attention to themselves.
I:11308;460;i loved it when I first saw it as a 12.
I:11308;461;natural and lovely girl, and kind.
I:11308;462;Nice movie for the sentiment between little girl and father.
I:11308;463;This is my favorite movie and I wore out my last copy.
I:11308;464;I love to read a book and then see the movie.
I:11308;465;Enjoyed seeing Tatum O'Neal in this cute film.
I:11308;466;Family friendly as far as older films go.
I:11308;467;This movie perfectly sets a depression area mood.
I:11308;468;Some of the best use of black and white photography in a modern.
I:11308;469;Great story and perfect chemistry between the real father daughter team of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal.
I:11308;470;Paper Moon explores the incredible journey of two unlikely souls adrift in the American heartland during the depths of the great depression.
I:11308;471;The background sounds of radio broadcasts connects the viewer with the popular figures of the times.
I:11308;472;The voices of Jack Benny and Fred Allen along with the music of Ozzie Nelson, Paul Whiteman and Tommy Dorsey all remind us of the innocence of the day.
I:11308;473;"As in ""The Last Picture Show"", Bagdanovich knows exactly how to integrate the background ""radio chatter"" into the scene with perfection."
I:11308;474;"easily two of my favorite movies, ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""Paper Moon"" are absolutely brilliant."
I:11308;475;Kudos to Peter Bagdanovich for such picture perfect and finely crafted motion pictures.
I:11308;476;It is a cute movie.
I:11308;477;I'm not sure how Tatum O'Neal got an Oscar for her performance.
I:11308;478;in with the bootlegger and the end of the romance with Madeline Kahn).
I:11308;479;There was some potential for great comedic and dramatic moments that just went to black and let you imagine how they happened.
I:11308;480;Ya just gotta see this incredible movie to appreciate it!
I:11308;481;Superb script and acting, its my own private cult classic!
I:11308;482;No wonder Tatum won an award for her first picture.
I:11308;483;The story and the script are crisp, fresh and devoid of sentimentality.
I:11308;484;It is as sweet and believeable as the first time I saw it.
I:11308;485;But the award really has to be seen as a tribute of sorts to director Peter Bogdanovich, who exacted an astonishingly assured, deadpan comic performance out of her, and then built an almost perfect piece of cinema around it.
I:11308;486;But this movie has it all: period detail, brilliant dialogue, wonderful performances, and elegantly economical storytelling.
I:11308;487;focus cinematography, cutting on motion, or creating intimacy or tension through camera set.
I:11308;488;As an honour to an entire film built around what may be the best.
I:11308;489;directed child performance of all time, Tatum's Oscar was well.
I:11308;490;and the supporting cast is excellent as well.
I:11308;491;it will hold your interest througout.
I:11308;492;They were both great in this movie.
I:11308;493;I have always found Addie to be funny, especially in the scene in the diner when she and Moses are eating, and she is griping about wanting her $200 (that made me laugh).
I:11308;494;I also thought Madeline Kahn was funny as well, who played Miss Trixie Delight.
I:11308;495;PJ Johnson (who played Imogene, Miss Trixie's maid), was brilliant.
I:11308;496;Peter Bogdanovich did great directing the film as well.
I:11308;497;There are some special features, as well, such as widescreen viewing, Peter's commentary during the film, which is interesting, because he will fill you in on how certain scenes were done, etc.
I:11308;498;There is also a documentary that profiles the making of the movie, which makes a nice addition to this movie.
I:11308;499;Any person who is a fan of this movie must get it and add it to their movie collection.
I:11308;500;Kudos to the actors for their great performances in this movie and Peter Bogdanovich for his directing.
I:11308;501;This will always be one of my most favorites!
I:11308;502;It all comes together in this funny and poignant tale of a con artist and his unwanted traveling companion, set during the depths of the Depression.
I:11308;503;father in real life adds a layer of authenticity to the film.
I:11308;504;Tatum won an Oscar for her performance, but Madeline Kahn nearly steals the movie as Trixie Delight.
I:11308;505;I have watched this movie at least 50 times since it was released, and I always find it thoroughly entertaining.
I:11308;506;Wonderful movie, carried mainly by the O'Neill father and daughter.
I:11308;507;The novel deserves 10 gold stars.
I:11308;508;The author kept your interest with telling it in such detail you felt you were right there with all the people, seeing it all unfold first hand.
I:11308;509;if you want a good action packed book, this one is IT.
I:11308;510;This is back at the height of Ryan's fame and Tatum gives one of the best performances by a child actor EVER.
I:11308;511;Forget everything you've heard about these two over the last ten or twenty years and just enjoy a classic and original movie about a father (?)
I:11308;512;And it was and is STILL one of my favorites.
I:11308;513;As wonderful as I remember.
I:11308;514;Watched it a lot when I was a kid so the movie has sentimental value to me as well.
I:11308;515;Bonus was that my kids enjoyed it too.
I:11308;516;Loved this movie as a kid and it's still one of my favorites as an adult, but I would be cautious about allowing very young children to watch because of some of the adult content.
I:11308;517;A great movie for younger people to see a little of the great depression
I:11308;518;"Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are pure magic as the ""one step ahead of em"" con artists, but it is little Tatum O'Neal who completely steals the show!"
I:11308;519;Filmed in beautiful black and white which sets the tone of this depression era comedy.
I:11308;520;The supporting cast in excellent too, so the film never drags.
I:11308;521;She's a doll in some scenes, and a scamp in other scenes.
I:11308;522;No wonder she won the Oscar!
I:11308;523;And, a joy to see Madeline Kahn .
I:11308;524;a treasure to watch, and still missed.
I:11308;525;tatum O'Neal should have won the Oscar for Best Actress not the Supprting Oscar and the magnificent Miss Kahn should have won the Supporting Oscar.
I:11308;526;it is just a perfect film on all levels!
I:11308;527;The photography is super and the old scratchy 78's used for the film's score is wonderful.
I:11308;528;Bogdonovich's direction is pitch perfect and the acting.
I:11308;529;well, even the tiniest roles are played to perfection.
I:11308;530;It was a fun experience while living in a midwest town.
I:11308;531;a wonderful, classic movie that will live on as one of the greatest!!!!
I:11308;532;Great story of times gone by and some of the people who managed to do well regardless of the Depression going on around them and how they did it.
I:11308;533;Quite an enjoyable little movie I enjoyed watching during my teen years.
I:11308;534;direction, writing, casting, cinematography, performances, music.
I:11308;535;right down to the last prop.
I:11308;536;for this triumphant picture by Peter Bogdanovich and Company.
I:11308;537;"the Director's Commentary track is fantastic and will probably entice you to put Bogdanovich on your list of ""Most Sought After Dinner Party Guest."""
I:11308;538;His stories are as entertaining as they are enlightening.
I:11308;539;all perfection in this timeless classic.
I:11308;540;One of the best family movies that has been forgotten as the years have passed is Paper Moon.
I:11308;541;It's funny and it gets into your heart.
I:11308;542;artist),played by O'Neils daugher Tatum, across the U. s. during the Great Depression.
I:11308;543;The movie is never boring, and language is fine.
I:11308;544;"P. j. Johnson also does a great job playing Trixie's ""maid"" Imogene."
I:11308;545;Few will recall that funny man Randy Quaid(the National Lampoon's Vacation's Cousin Eddie)has a part in the film.
I:11308;546;It is something that you will definatly want to share with your family.
I:11308;547;This movie is untraditional and very unpredictable but great to watch.
I:11308;548;It's funny, cute, and lovable at the same time!
I:11308;549;This is a wonderful period piece.
I:11308;550;All the actors put in a terrific performance.
I:11308;551;It's such a cute touching movie.
I:11308;552;The movie still holds up.
I:11308;553;Great acting, a wonderful follow up after making The Last picture show.
I:11308;554;I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdonavich.
I:11308;555;This film certainly takes the cake.
I:11308;556;Especially, Tatum's performance is a deodate for us.
I:11308;557;her time period and i think she really enjoyed it
I:11308;558;I saw this movie many years ago I really enjoyed it.
I:11308;559;Can't say anymore, thanks again
I:11308;560;Young Tatum O'Neil is amazing.
I:11308;561;Yes, as others are saying, this is a great film.
I:11308;562;Ryan O'Neil and daughter, Tatum provide an entertaining, light hearted, story about the closeness of a father and daughter trying to survive by using their wits and the close relationship which develops from their joint adventures.
I:11308;563;Tatum O'Neil received an Academy Award for her work in the film.
I:11308;564;Their expressions and timing are amazing as we imagine them using their real lives as valuable experience for the roles.
I:11308;565;The whole motley crew is entertaining.
I:11308;566;It is a beautiful, beautiful and humorous movie.
I:11308;567;I wish the father and daughter could have given us more of this wonderful stuff over the years.
I:11308;568;So many memorable, quotable scenes.
I:11308;569;As a movie buff, I have viewed and enjoyed a number of pictures, but I have never considered one of them my all.
I:11308;570;I couldn't help but laugh.
I:11308;571;No, I said, it's a happy movie.
I:11308;572;I can't help but smile, each and every time I watch it.
I:11308;573;This was a favorite movie of mine as a kid growing up.
I:11308;574;Can't believe I waited so long to see this.
I:11308;575;A fine pair dancing through a dynamic as complicated as it gets.
I:11308;576;I can watch this with the sentimental and the heartless alike.
I:11308;577;I love the beautiful black and white and the locations.
I:11308;578;The film had director Peter Bogdanavich's sweeping vision of the Depression era, but it was also an ideal vehicle for the father.
I:11308;579;Lucky for us, the chemistry here is terrific (it was good enough to earn first.
I:11308;580;timer Tatum an Oscar win).
I:11308;581;The late, great Madeline Kahn even wanders in halfway through the film as exotic dancer Trixie Delight, bringing some funny moments with a slight touch of pathos in her characterization (and earning her a nomination as well).
I:11308;582;shot on location in and around Kansas/Missouri, Bogdanavich's black and white visual look perfectly captures the wide.
I:11308;583;it's a small, subtle gem of a picture, a blend of comedy, drama and visual style.
I:11308;584;Saw this in the 70's and showed it to my 10 year old who enjoyed it.
I:11308;585;I've always enjoyed this movie.
I:11308;586;This was a good movie to see with my wife.
I:11308;587;The direction provides us with some wonderfully framed scenes.
I:11308;588;The father/daughter interaction is perfect.
I:11308;589;Madeline Kahn is always a delight !
I:11308;590;Watching still my favorite movie!
I:11308;591;I was so happy to find this an a great present.
I:11308;592;As good as I remembered it from decades ago.
I:11308;593;Tatum O'Neal's all star performance.
I:11308;594;The storyline was a good one too .
I:11308;595;The joy, the sorrows a bevy of fine performances will keep your sunny side up throughout this unique period film from the seventies.
I:11308;596;Overjoyed on hearing the news that a favorite film is being released on this superb format always is such a pleasant surprise in a sea of disposable entertainment.
I:11308;597;the price of this heartfelt masterpiece is something that NO one should squabble in consideration.
I:11308;598;The memories share in Extras by Mr. Bogdanovich and members of the production crew along with rare outtakes wraps up this delectable gem like Cotton Candy swirled on a paper cone, sweet and sticky, but finger licking good!Also included is the joy of a Commentary track by Mr. Bogdanovich, now what more could you possibly asked for .
I:11308;599;Any doubt regarding Ryan O'Neal's talent for acting may be put to rest with a critical analysis of the work that he turns in here, which is extraordinary in all its variegated nuance.
I:11308;600;complex, and egaging, in its own right.
I:11308;601;The screenplay plays poignant homage to the psychology of the 'abandoned' Addie, with such beauty, and accurateness, that it almost hurts.
I:11308;602;I hope that others will 'adopt' this gem, a touching film that will certainly survive the test of eternity.
I:11308;603;she was an incredible actress .
I:11308;604;Its worth the price and came in quicker than I had anticipated.
I:11308;605;Bognonavich was a bit of a darling and at the height of his popularity and power when this modest script presented.
I:11308;606;This is a s perfect a film as Bogdonavich made, though it didn't claim the critical kudos of, 'What's Up Doc?'
I:11308;607;, and the brilliant,'Last Picture Show'.
I:11308;608;"Most of the cast from these two gems, moved with him on this project
I:11308;609;It is a role for which she received just rewards and will take your heart any which way.
I:11308;610;She's a tough, shrewd, brilliant survivor (at least at this stage of her celluloid life).
I:11308;611;"The look of the film is enthralling
I:11308;612;angled lens giving sharpness of detail and wonderful depth of field.
I:11308;613;This is a classic movie for many reasons.
I:11308;614;This movie will be studied by film students for many decades to come.
I:11308;615;For the art of filming in Black and White,the total in focus both foreground and background, that helps tell many facets of the story.
I:11308;616;The Academy gave her an Oscar, and for good reason.
I:11308;617;And Madeline Kahn is radiant and truly hilarious as Trixie Delight, as is her under.
I:11308;618;The writing is tight, never cloying, and explores an interesting relationship at a peculiar moment in American history.
I:11308;619;This movie is lean, funny, moving and resonant on every level.
I:11308;620;This is one of my top favorite movies ever!
I:11308;621;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:11308;622;She thinks it's funny too.
I:11308;623;This is a great film that everyone in the family can enjoy.
I:11308;624;This film is full of thrills and a great example of the old saying, Home is where the heart is .
I:11308;625;Along the way, they meet some very interesting people, including a showgirl named Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn).
I:11308;626;"The use of music is in direct contrast to this sentiment
I:11308;627;This casting choice turned out to be a stroke of genius and Tatum won the best supporting actress Oscar at the age of ten.
I:11308;628;i enjoyed seeing Ryan and Tatum interacting with each other.
I:11308;629;It was pretty much family fare by today's ratings.
I:11308;630;The script, direction, and acting in Paper Moon are all top notch, but the cinematography sets the tone of movie all by itself.
I:11308;631;Anyone who has lived out on the Great Plains can testify to the tremendous vistas that always carry a strong sense of loneliness in the fall.
I:11308;632;In this golden age of cgi and the steady cam, it's nice to be reminded of what can be conveyed with simple long shots.
I:11308;633;Clean, fun and cleaver period movie that is a great watch.
I:11308;634;One of the best and most entertaining films ever to come out of Hollywood.
I:11308;635;Beautifully acted, directed, and photographed, with a scrumptious and historically accurate music.
I:11308;636;Often hilarious, the movie will touch your heart.
I:11308;637;In the special features, the audio.
I:11308;638;commentary is superb, and will make you appreciate the film even more.
I:11308;639;the cinematography and set design is outstanding, so much so that the film could be from the era it depicts and not the 1970's when it was actually made.
I:11308;640;Quite apart from the aesthetic beauty and historical accuracy, the central performances are stunning, the O'Neil partnership is electric and thoroughly hypnotic.
I:11308;641;"Tatum O'Neil shines with irridescence as the wise, astute, tough little cookie
I:11308;642;Khan is also impeccably comedic and vilely acidic at once.
I:11308;643;a deserved classic and one of the most amazing child actor performances in cinema history!
I:11308;644;"Adapted from the matchless novel ""Addie Pray"" by Joe David Brown, Paper Moon is set in the Midwest/dustbowl during the Great Depression/Roosevelt era."
I:11308;645;a. kind directing by Peter Bogdanovich, beautiful black and white cinematography, a great musical score with snippets of old time radio shows like Fibber McGee and Molly, Jack Benny and a host of others.
I:11308;646;life father and daughter duo, Ryan and Tatum O'Neil team up in this gem of a movie.
I:11308;647;Tatum plays Addie and garnered the coveted Oscar for her performance at the tender age of 10.
I:11308;648;In one of the best scenes in the movie they deal with whether or not Addie is Moses' illegitimate daughter.
I:11308;649;Ryan and Tatum's bantering repartee is natural, hilarious and touching all at the same time.
I:11308;650;this is a great family movie with a touching father/daughter story to share.
I:11308;651;around crowd pleaser whether you are 6 or 106.
I:11308;652;I don't mind telling you that this is my favorite movie of all time and I have viewed it upwards of 100 times.
I:11308;653;I still laugh, cry, and go through a multitude of emotions no matter how many times a watch the film.
I:11308;654;Certainly, a hallmark of a great cinematic masterpiece!
I:11308;655;tatum is great and so is her dad.
I:11308;656;I thought that I would enjoy it more than I did.
I:11308;657;All and all it is a movie that didn't appeal to me, but if am sure that a lot of people will enjoy it.
I:11308;658;Probably the most natural acting I've ever seen Ryan in.
I:11308;659;Ryan was the darling of all the female actresses in Hollywood back then and you can see why.
I:11308;660;She seems like a nice mom and grown woman with the burden of some crazy making .
I:11308;661;The plot revolves around a con man (Ryan O'Neal) who unexpectedly has a young girl (an Oscar.
I:11308;662;winning Tatum O'Neal) come into his care.
I:11308;663;both O'Neals are excellent, but what really makes this movie is the way that Bogdanovich and his team used black and white cinematography and production design to make the setting (Depression era Kansas) believeable.
I:11308;664;The bond between the two O'Neals is never sentimentalized, and while Tatum may not be a great actress, her directness works well for the part.
I:11308;665;There's also an outstanding supporting performance by Madeline Kahn as a dancer the two travelers encounter along the way.
I:11308;666;Kahn and Tatum have a beautiful little scene together on a hillside where they both acknowledge that the other is on the make.
I:11308;667;Good story line and character development.
I:11308;668;Bodonovich (best spelled) has picked up the feel of the great depression so vividly.
I:11308;669;Tatum and her father are just perfectly matched in this depression era film.
I:11308;670;Countless Bravos for the cinematic technique, the script, direction, etcSo.
I:11308;671;It's great fun, also great acting, also great story!
I:11308;672;It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.
I:11308;673;everyone needs to see this movie so they can recall scenes in conversation.
I:11308;674;Basically, seeing movies like these, keep you in touch with most present day social situations.
I:11308;675;Clever dialog, good story line with a few surprises.
I:11308;676;About as close to family entertainment as you can get nowadays.
I:11308;677;Paper Moon is one of those great old Hollywood type films.
I:11308;678;It has that charm that we seldom find nowadays.
I:11308;679;It's just fun and simple and makes you laugh.
I:11308;680;The film is also absolutely stunning visually.
I:11308;681;She's cute, funny and street smart and does an unbelievable job for a 10 year old.
I:11308;682;The title also has a famous story about how Orson Wells notoriously said that title is so good you could just release the title without the movie.
I:11308;683;It worth seeing by those who love that old Hollywood charm and those who just want a good fun lite film.
I:11308;684;This is a really entertaining movie.
I:11308;685;Tatem O'Neill did a really good job and actually received an Oscar for her performance.
I:11308;686;Ok, I love this movie and I am so happy to own it.
I:11308;687;It is a classic, and Tatum O'Neal is even more charming than her father/co.
I:11308;688;This film a is sweet, entertaining caper!
I:11308;689;This film is classic in it's self due the fact that it was made in black and white when most films at time were all made in color.
I:11308;690;Tatum O'Neal truly deserved her Oscar for her performance.
I:11308;691;Great cameo by Madeline Khan.
I:11308;692;This is a film with excellent acting, great black and white photography and an outstanding script.
I:11308;693;The mood and ambiance of the story is greatly enhanced by the use of period music and radio shows which are inserted on a radio that is hauled everywhere by the heroine of the story.
I:11308;694;The film is impressive by the attention to historical detail in settings, architecture, automobiles, clothing, culture and behavior.
I:11308;695;It is well worth viewing more than once.
I:11308;696;This is very good old black and white movie that is good for the whole family.
I:11308;697;I watched this movie with the Mrs. since it seemed more like a chic flic , but it turned out to be a nice clever movie.
I:11308;698;It is worth a watch when you need to impress your woman by watching something a girl would normally watch.
I:11308;699;It has some good humor in it to keep it interesting.
I:11308;700;This movie was lighthearted, comical, cute, and refreshing.
I:11308;701;The part with Miss Trixie I found to be especially entertaining.
I:11308;702;The acting team of father and daughter playing these roles amazing.
I:11308;703;(And what an impression I got!)
I:11308;704;She smokes, swears and screams.
I:11308;705;film and that she won an Oscar.
I:11308;706;But I will always hope the best for Tatum, for her role in 'Paper Moon' will always be in my heart.
I:11308;707;This movie is set in the Great Depression in the back country of middle America, where most everybody is having trouble surviving.
I:11308;708;this is one of the classic American movies of the 1970s, or ever.
I:11308;709;Ryan and his daughter Tatum give excellant performances and this movie depiction of America in this era is spot.
I:11308;710;This movie should be seen by everyone and gets my highest recommendation.
I:11308;711;The black and white images are worthy of John Ford.
I:11308;712;The humor is worthy of Mark Twain.
I:11308;713;The performances are subtle and brave.
I:11308;714;Wonderful, heartfelt, delightful, and sad.
I:11308;715;Lots of fun to watch.
I:11308;716;One of those movies you can watch over and over again and enjoy.
I:11308;717;Highly recommended for the hole family.
I:11308;718;I saw this back in the '70s and remembered it was a good one so I wanted to see it again.
I:11308;719;I didn't fully appreciate its greatness that first time.
I:11308;720;Tatum's performance is superb as was the director's.
I:11308;721;It's one of those rare times when everything comes together to create a true classic.
I:11308;722;Saw it when it was first released and forgot what a great movie it is.
I:11308;723;Amazing acting and timing between the O'Neals.
I:11308;724;all actors and directors were great.
I:11308;725;It was and still is an amazing movie.
I:11308;726;She had a natural talent and that is what I knew would get her the Academy Award.
I:11308;727;I still smile every time I think about that movie: after all, IT WAS ONLY A PAPER MOON.
I:11308;728;this movie is one of my favorites.
I:11308;729;It was funny and touching.
I:11308;730;Tatum O'Neal was brilliant and her co. stars were excellent.
I:11308;731;"The pairing makes for a wild ride especially when they come across Madeline Khan (very funny) and her ""assistant"" (she's hysterical)."
I:11308;732;tatum won an OSCAR for this performance and you'll se why.
I:11308;733;The director commentary is amazing!
