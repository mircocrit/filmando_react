I:9724;1;Tarantino dialogue and humor, interesting plot .
I:9724;2;The soundtrack is excellent, too!
I:9724;3;The strength of Quentin Tarantino lies in his snappy, realistic, and sometimes humorous dialogue.
I:9724;4;Jakie Brown, like Pulp Fiction before it, is filled with eccentric characters spouting out every day conversations that are believable and fresh.
I:9724;5;the charm of Jackie Brown is Tarantino cutting back on the gratutious violence, which is okay from time to time, but essentially to showcase yourself as a director you have to show some range.
I:9724;6;And with Pam Grier and Robert Forster, two actors that haven't shown what they're made of years before this film, giving fine mature performances that again show what Tarantino can do for an actor's career, the director has found that range, and it should be interesting to see where he goes next.
I:9724;7;with a soundtrack that's brings a cool, mellow atmosphere to the film, it's easy to sit back and find your groove while watching the film.
I:9724;8;In many ways, I find this film superior to Pulp Fiction in that Tarantino takes his time developing the characters and the plot.
I:9724;9;Perhaps it's an homage to an age when short attentions spans didn't rule cinema, and it's good to see a guy who helped reign in that ADD movie chic calm down and let a movie breathe before giving the payoff.
I:9724;10;grier and Forster make the movie worth watching alone, but you can't deny the powerful actor that is Samuel L. Jackson.
I:9724;11;You can literally see Jackson create the character in front of your eyes, by using Olivier techniques of cosmetic props.
I:9724;12;"Also supporting the moive is a solid, charismastic performance from Michael Keaton, a quiet, every day character that isn't the norm for one Robert Deniro, and Bridget Fonda, an intelligent actress, perfectly filling in the role of the ""surfer chick"", with a tiny bit of Femme Fatale thrown in."
I:9724;13;solid work from Tarantino, a great cast, an adaptation of Rum Punch.
I:9724;14;I think this is a very complex and satisfying film.
I:9724;15;This isn't about a multimillion dollar heist, and the criminals are likeable and genuinely interesting even if one or two are full of themselves (Namely Ordell and Melanie.)
I:9724;16;The film opens with the classic Across 110th Street as sung by Bobby Womack and featuring a strong Pam Grier, walking that moving sidewalk at LAX.
I:9724;17;From then on we meet a handful of excentric baddies and law enforcers, that are all likeable, interesting and have at least one or two funny lines (with the exception of the cop who isn't Michael Keaton, who is just a plain jackass cowboy cop) My favorite part is the friendship/romance between Pam and the subtle and sensational Robert Forster.
I:9724;18;Starting with a very special ride home, which bleeds to a bar, and then to Griers Apartment.
I:9724;19;All involve rich dialogue and interest shown.
I:9724;20;"They bond thru body language, their age, and eventually music(""The Del. fonics"".)"
I:9724;21;They are at times funny, terrifying, and very well acted.
I:9724;22;There is just a bunch of rich characters here, and they all give great parts no matter how big or how small.
I:9724;23;especially Chris Tucker, who's performance as a snitch is equal parts brilliant and hilarious.
I:9724;24;This movie just hits a right note for anyone interested in a talky, rich picture.
I:9724;25;Tarantino says this is a movie for older people, well at 19, I'm definitely not younger, but this is my favorite of all tarantino films, be it because of the great soundtrack, storyline, performances, direction it makes no difference.
I:9724;26;Give it a chance and you'll see what I see.
I:9724;27;Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's best film.
I:9724;28;The awesome cast is firing on all cylinders to give the movie a real backbone.
I:9724;29;the film works better on more levels than any other Tarantino.
I:9724;30;"Three main reasons
I:9724;31;The personal touches for each of the players here are well done by the actors, but Tarantino simply worships them with his words, his camera and his soundtrack.
I:9724;32;More than 10 years on, Jackie Brown feels fresher and far more mature than a re.
I:9724;33;On the other hand, Jackie Brown is a true love song to Pam Grier, the 70s and Blaxploitation and movies in general.
I:9724;34;but above all that, Jackie Brown is solid and just a damn good movie on any level.
I:9724;35;I doubt he'll ever make one as good.
I:9724;36;Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, finds the writer/director at perhaps his most straight.
I:9724;37;"On the surface, it appears to be just another heist film, but underneath all the layers, at its core, ""Jackie Brown"" is an unlikely love story from probably the last director you'd expect."
I:9724;38;While the job and the way it's carried out is a big part of the film, Tarantino knows well enough to allow his characters ample time to breathe, making it the sort of film where you forget for a while who you're watching and simply appreciate the unique personalities they bring to life.
I:9724;39;it also helps, of course, that the film is filled to brim with a great cast of old and new, obscure and respectable.
I:9724;40;Robert De Niro has perhaps one of the most entertaining roles as an ex.
I:9724;41;Grier and Forster, who were both dragged from the depths of obscurity only to find their careers slightly revitalized for the film are both in top form and go a long way in driving home the human nature of the plot.
I:9724;42;Michael Keaton, playing an ATF agent who would later appear as the same character in 1998'sOut of Sight, is perhaps one of the film's greatest surprises, as he is in turns quirky and overly confident, while being clueless all the while.
I:9724;43;"while fans of Tarantino's more notorious fare will have a hard time seeing the brilliance of ""Jackie Brown,"" it's a film that will no doubt please the palate of the viewer who craves rich characters, natural pacing and an engrossing plot, not to mention a killer soundtrack."
I:9724;44;Out of all of Tarantino's work, this is the one that is the most grounded in reality and, aside from Forster's Oscar nomination, deserved much more acclaim and credit than it was given.
I:9724;45;In a way, this is the cult classic in Tarantino's league of cult classics, and a film that certainly holds up time and time again.
I:9724;46;I read with great interest the 4 and 5 stars reviews.
I:9724;47;interesting story, strong characters, etc.
I:9724;48;The 2 stars are really for the acting which is well done.
I:9724;49;Better than I thought and better than my friends told me it was.
I:9724;50;I liked the scenario, the playing roles, you get totally immersed from the begining to the end.
I:9724;51;music is ok, not much creativity
I:9724;52;With hilariously awkward moments and times when stuff just happens that you wouldn't expect, this movie is greatly under appreciated.
I:9724;53;The characters are funny as heck, and the situations they are in are not only dramatic but comical.
I:9724;54;above all, the main character comes out better off than `the brilliant director' does .
I:9724;55;(Pulp Fiction, which had great moments and great cameos, rode on the shoulders of Samuel Jackson's amazing performance.
I:9724;56;Jackie Brown is the one movie where QT got it right.
I:9724;57;Pam Grier and Robert Forster are superb as unremarkable people caught in an extraordinary squeeze.
I:9724;58;The dialogue is excellent in spots, and the actors time everything just right, but there's never that spark of genius that propelled Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.
I:9724;59;It's still watchable, and great in spots, but it's not the movie that Pulp Fiction was.
I:9724;60;Anything with Samuel L. Jackson is always worth watching!
I:9724;61;A great cast and a great story.
I:9724;62;Quinton Tarantino is one of those directors you either love or hate, but there is no denying that he has talent, and what makes his talent even more obvious is his rich sense of style.
I:9724;63;Tarantino has a very unique charm that he layers his films with, giving them such warm originality.
I:9724;64;the film is littered with great performances by a slew of talented actors.
I:9724;65;Pam Grier steps into the lead role of Jackie Brown, and she manages to create a masterfully layered woman.
I:9724;66;She is smart, witty and strong, yet she gives her layers of fragility which help establish this woman's true nature.
I:9724;67;Samuel L. Jackson, who also worked with Tarantino (and managed an Oscar nomination) in `Pulp Fiction', plays Ordell Brown with the same quick witted sense of humor with which he played Jules Winnfield.
I:9724;68;He is engaging and hilarious and somewhat scary.
I:9724;69;The combination works just as well the second go around.
I:9724;70;Robert Forster (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance) gives Max Cherry a marvelous sense of honesty that comes of rather pure in this film filled with double crossing liars and manipulators.
I:9724;71;His character is the richest of the bunch, in the subtlest of ways.
I:9724;72;the supporting cast, including Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and Chris Tucker, are all on the top of their game, especially De Niro who almost feels like a simpleton yet he builds (gradually) layers of intelligence into his character.
I:9724;73;The thing is, the scope of Jackie Brown is a lot simpler than that of `Pulp Fiction', which threw a large amount of characters into a twisting plot, whereas `Jackie Brown' focuses on a few characters in one plot and thus allows more time for us to engage in these particular characters and get to know them.
I:9724;74;This movie depicts great cinematography with great characters.
I:9724;75;Kill Bill, which is his latest is to be an epic.
I:9724;76;This movie belongs to two women: Jackie Brown and Pam Grier.
I:9724;77;I enjoyed watching Jackie Brown struggle against the superpowers of her world, and I was refreshed and uplifted by Pam Grier's originality in portraying her.
I:9724;78;the movie definitely needs to be seen more than once.
I:9724;79;take a closer look at this movie.
I:9724;80;aged lady, I LOVE this story about a powerful woman who takes action to change the course of her life.
I:9724;81;It's a great story, and filmed beautifully.
I:9724;82;Loved this movie, I literally watch it over and over still trying to understand the plot and the whole scheme that was set up, Quentin Tarantino has made 1 of the best movies ever.
I:9724;83;First of all, Pam Grier was beautiful.
I:9724;84;Robert DeNiro enjoyed playing his role.
I:9724;85;A Thriller of a Movie.
I:9724;86;Jackie Brown: rated R, 2 hours and 40 minutesJackie Brown is an incredibly well played movie about guns, drugs, and money.
I:9724;87;Jackie is held in custody facing possible time in prison, when the deceptive Ordell, played by black talking Samuel L. Jackson steps into the picture.
I:9724;88;Ordell hires an honest bailbondsman, Max Cherry, to release Ms. Brown.
I:9724;89;While Ordell takes care of business, we see behind.
I:9724;90;quentin Tarantino, creator of Jackie Brown, is master of `film noir', and adds an interesting perspective to one scene in particular.
I:9724;91;Tarantino deserves much credit for its ingenious execution, and Jackie Brown in its entirety is recognized as a success, with phenomenal acting by the whole cast, primarily Pam Grier.
I:9724;92;pam Grier shines in this one and deserved to be given an award for herperformance but as I said the film was not tremendously popular however bothher and Samuel L. Jackson got Golden Globe nominations and the film got anacademy award nomination.
I:9724;93;Robert Forster and Michael Keaton are also in itand were excellent.
I:9724;94;A great cast that makes a classic Tarantino movie.
I:9724;95;Many of the Elmore Leonard novels make enjoyable movies (Get Shorty, Out of Sight), and this is no exception
I:9724;96;this movie has a great storyline and i love how tarantino doesn't tell the story straight.
I:9724;97;Time will prove this movie a masterpiece.
I:9724;98;Jackie Brown has pacing, intelligence, laughs, atmosphere, and thrills .
I:9724;99;none the least of which are in the utterly honest and often hilarious dialogue .
I:9724;100;but mostly it has heart.
I:9724;101;Quentin Tarantino has created a love story for the 1990s and a song for the ages.
I:9724;102;Max Cherry and Jackie Brown are easily the hottest middle.
I:9724;103;I love a Tarantino movie like I love chips and salsa.
I:9724;104;Not his best movie, but any movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Tarantino paired will make for an entertaining 2 hours!
I:9724;105;I enjoyed catching little gems in the film that I never noticed the first time around such as the brilliant subtlety of Robert DeNiros's hilarious performance.
I:9724;106;on.1 interview in which Tarantino not only discusses the film, but the whole atmosphere surrounding the film during it's release, his hopes and dissapointments the film's release brought, and why this project was such a labour of love for him.
I:9724;107;Though JB is not quite on par with PF, it is a good film worth of respect.
I:9724;108;one of the major assets of this picture is the outstanding cast.
I:9724;109;Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro and Samuel L. Jackson deliver fine performances and Robert Forster is the standout of the fantastic supporting cast.
I:9724;110;His dialogue is even better than Elmore Leonard's original.
I:9724;111;As in his previous pics, Tarantino effectively uses source music throughout the film.
I:9724;112;Jackie Brown confirms that Tarantino is one of the most talented american directors and a filmmaker whose next film will be an event worth looking forward to.
I:9724;113;At any rate it's a good flick worth watching.
I:9724;114;Perhaps not the best, but definitely worth watching.
I:9724;115;All of the performances are top.
I:9724;116;If you haven't seen it, please do!
I:9724;117;I will watch this movie often.
I:9724;118;some scenes will shock you, but it all makes for a great film.
I:9724;119;This collector's edition includes alot of interveiws and some hilarious previews of other Pam Greir films from the 70s.
I:9724;120;opened my eyes to this actress.
I:9724;121;This is a superb example of Tarantino's talents.
I:9724;122;sided, but still technically a great improvement on VHS.
I:9724;123;budget, violent Resevoir Dogs , the seminal, highly acclaimed and influential Pulp Fiction , and Jackie Brown .
I:9724;124;Jackie Brown dispels the later notion, I think, adding another notch to the director's belt of cool flicks.
I:9724;125;But she's nabbed early on by an ATF agent, played by Michael Keaton.
I:9724;126;i really liked the scene where Max shows up on her doorstep the next morning and the two have coffee.
I:9724;127;It'll be interesting to see if Jackie Brown can do for Pam Grier's career what Pulp Fiction did for Travolta's.
I:9724;128;jACKIE BROWN is a film (based on Elmore Leonard's RUM PUNCH) that I come back to time and time again, drawn in the main by the wonderfully understated roles of Robert Forster and Pam Grier.
I:9724;129;uncelebrated, unknown in the main .
I:9724;130;The casting choices are inspired, each of them (especially Pam Grier and Robert Forester) really make the dialogue and scenes sizzle.
I:9724;131;Jackie Brown brought Grier back into the spotlight and has to be one of her best roles to date.
I:9724;132;"Jackie Brown and Max Cherry were two characters I found to be ""real"" enough to relate to and the chemistry between them was great."
I:9724;133;Samuel L. Jackson gave an awesome performance (as usual) and the beginning of the movie with him and Chris Tucker was hilarious.
I:9724;134;This was a great movie!
I:9724;135;I would give this movie 3.5 stars if possible.
I:9724;136;first off, I thought the ingredients for this movie were very good.
I:9724;137;The scripting was really good, the plot was well done.
I:9724;138;resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol I, and II.
I:9724;139;"Get Shorty and ""Out of Sight"" may have been Better All."
I:9724;140;Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker and Robert Forster are all Exceptional.
I:9724;141;De Niro and Forster Underplay their roles Wonderfully, letting Jackson and Grier share the Spotlight.
I:9724;142;Keaton and Tucker make the most of their small but Affective roles.
I:9724;143;This film is a classic with an all.
I:9724;144;Samuel L. Jackson, Bobby DeNiro, Robert Forester and Pam Grier offer dialogue that you just don't find in modern movies.
I:9724;145;Plus, Bridget Fonda is stunning.
I:9724;146;This film is a must have for movie buffs.
I:9724;147;Im a huge Quentin Tarrintino fan so when this product got to me i had high hopes.
I:9724;148;I love Tarantino movies, every single one of them!
I:9724;149;"It's hard not to be blown away by Fiction because of it's sheer audacity
I:9724;150;it's somewhat ironic that Tarantino, associated with the young hipster audience, made this film, because at the basic level Jackie Brown is about getting old.
I:9724;151;That the options available to a a middle.
I:9724;152;Tarantino shows an amazing prowess for getting into the head of this woman.
I:9724;153;His sensitive direction coupled with Pam Grier's top.
I:9724;154;notch performance combine to make Jackie one of the most compelling and honest female characters to hit the movie screen in recent years.
I:9724;155;the rest of the cast is uniformly excellent too.
I:9724;156;it's interesting to note that in the book this movie was based on, Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard, Jackie was white.
I:9724;157;This is one case where the movie greatly improves on its source material.
I:9724;158;Jackie Brown will take some commitment on behalf of the viewer.
I:9724;159;They merely illustrate that Tarantino has some range as a director, and I hope he continues to explore that range.
I:9724;160;Great adventure and action movie, would not suggest for children.
I:9724;161;Amazingly enough Quentin Tarantino's (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) stupendously enigmatic Jackie Brown constantly mesmerizes, habitually amuses, and solitarily overwhelms its audience with Tarantino's sheer focused manipulation of the aesthetic, dramatic, and artistic.
I:9724;162;star cast including Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael Bowen, and Chris Tucker.
I:9724;163;The film's bristles with outstandingly versatile performances, intensely creative plays on Tarantino's patented formula, and a newfound narrative looseness not quite found in his previous work.
I:9724;164;Caught in between possible incarceration on one side and assassination on the other, Jackie concocts a devious ploy upon criminal greed and law enforcement single.
I:9724;165;pam Grier, having her first leading role in years, radiantly shines as the quirky fiendishly no.
I:9724;166;Jackie may no longer be a spring chicken or startling beauty but she still has the mental scruples necessary to stay alive, and Greer articulates this massively sympathetic character at the jugular of the audience's sensibilities.
I:9724;167;brick road of unpredictability with hilariously provocative results.
I:9724;168;lavishly laced with a host of remarkably enduring criminal personalities including Jackson's passably intelligent criminally deprecating Small Arms dealer, De Niro's recently released seemingly happy.
I:9724;169;a. broad who's more intelligent and self.
I:9724;170;serving than those around her realize, and Chris Tucker's exceedingly self.
I:9724;171;towering with imposingly notable roles by almost every character, an immediately decipherable artistic narrative tenderness, and a suitably fitting thematically cohesiveness without all of his previous bombast, Jackie Brown represents a new mature level of filmmaking for Tarantino as he continues to let lose creativity on all facets and impress the masses with this deceptively simple crime tale that eludes to a lot more impressive talent and an ever growing intellect than one might have initially thought.
I:9724;172;Yet in the end, Jackie Brown will stand out as another phenomenal Tarantino character canvas of modern America that is more enthralling on every visceral level than a movie should be without coping out in the least.
I:9724;173;I liked this movie for all the reasons I like any Tarantino movie, but it was just slower, with fewer risks, twists, and turns.
I:9724;174;Jackie Brown is a nice, slowly paced film about love and redemption.
I:9724;175;His use of music is right on, and the dialogue is tip.
I:9724;176;It includes loads of special features and nice little posters.
I:9724;177;I hope you enjoy it!
I:9724;178;I watched the movie the day it came and it was wonderful.
I:9724;179;Not much else to say, it's just a great movie.
I:9724;180;I have watched it 3 times so far and I enjoyed each time better than the first.
I:9724;181;Great acting, wonderful story, and interesting characters.
I:9724;182;I love this Movie .
I:9724;183;it's in my top Ten films of the Nineties .
I:9724;184;the Dialogue is incredible .
I:9724;185;this movie ages like fine wine .
I:9724;186;This is not the usual Tarantino film in that there is not much action and not the usual buckets of blood, but it is a very good movie.
I:9724;187;Along with her bail bondsman Robert Forster, Grier concocts a plan where she has both the ATF and Jackson believing she is working with them.
I:9724;188;This is a well written and acted movie.
I:9724;189;It is also a testament to how well.
I:9724;190;Thanks to those who do this.
I:9724;191;I did see some grain in a couple of dark scenes.
I:9724;192;overall, a good movie, and a worthwhile Blu.
I:9724;193;It's a surprise in how truly good it is.
I:9724;194;I don't think many critics understood just how many complexities this film has, and it's a satisfying and enjoyable 2 hours.
I:9724;195;robert Forrester gives one of the most brilliantly understated performances ever seen.
I:9724;196;It is written all over everything when he is with her, and it's an intellegent and poigniant performance.
I:9724;197;Pam Grier proves that age can and does add to sex appeal, and Bridget Fonda has a 'cameo' role that is not to be missed.
I:9724;198;just didn't seem necessary, for instance), but this is a great movie you won't be sorry you own.
I:9724;199;"I found the storyline interesting
I:9724;200;The cast is first rate from start to finish and so is the flick.
I:9724;201;Pam Grier has a very charming mouth and generally lovable way with people.
I:9724;202;as for performances, the best ones are oddly the ones who have barely done work.
I:9724;203;Pam Grier and Robert Forrester are great in their roles.
I:9724;204;Surprisingly, Chris Tucker in a very bit role(I'm talking at least 10 minutes if that) is quite good.
I:9724;205;One of the better ones is a big sitdown with Quentin Tarantino in an interview with a somewhat audible interviewer.
I:9724;206;It's interesting and oddly enough, he can sound like a black person can sound.
I:9724;207;A must see for people looking for a good plot, a nice twist, a interesting script.
I:9724;208;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9724;209;The service from seller is great price is good and the product is five stars.
I:9724;210;Jackie is a cool female character.
I:9724;211;It was fun to watch her start out in a tough situation and come out on top.
I:9724;212;For as much as I love PULP FICTION, and I do mean love, this movie is also top notch on Tarantino's directorial career.
I:9724;213;Great style, great characters, stupendous dialogue, and an ingenious setting depict everything this movie's about.
I:9724;214;Combine Elmore Leonard and Tarantino and you can't go wrong.
I:9724;215;This is a good one.
I:9724;216;Don't get me wrong this film is great and hilarious, especially the chemistry between De Niro and Jackson, its just so funny.
I:9724;217;"another fun thing to this movie was that all the ebonics and how the movie started the same way Dustin Hoffman's begning film ""The Graduate"" started out."
I:9724;218;tV movie, utilizing many of the stock filmmaking techniques that he shunned in PF.
I:9724;219;Cut to the other character.
I:9724;220;Cut back to the other character.
I:9724;221;Tarantino's dialogue is great, and he's one of the best directors who ever lived, but scene after scene in which two people are smoking cigarettes and talking in a rather bland and boring office remind me more of a Movie of the Week than Tarantino.
I:9724;222;Robert De Niro is here in a Tarantino film, and he's the most underused actor in the entire movie.
I:9724;223;robert Forster provides the only saving grace.
I:9724;224;He's solid as Max Cherry and deserved his Oscar nomination.
I:9724;225;QT resurrected himself with the dazzling Kill Bill, the epic that makes even Pulp Fiction look like child's play.
I:9724;226;This is an exciting movie with an all time great cast.
I:9724;227;The cast is so good that DeNiro has a relatively minor role.
I:9724;228;Pam Grier is excellent as a mature woman desperately trying to make some kind of a career last, no matter how limited, while running money for a gun dealer, played by Samuel L. Jackson.
I:9724;229;Jackson is terrific, as a manic yet terrifying killer whose ambition is to make lots of money no matter what the price for any associates.
I:9724;230;The interplay between Forster and Grier play off extremley well against the fearsome street smart Jackson.
I:9724;231;Very well done and Pam Grier looks terrific and sexy even in her movie charcter's mid life crisis.
I:9724;232;Typical Quentin Tarantino style film the retro made it interesting.
I:9724;233;One of our favorite movies ~ and very hard to find.
I:9724;234;If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan or Jackie Brown fan, I would recommend you snatch this up.
I:9724;235;Jackie Brown is my favorite film of ALL time.
I:9724;236;It's an intense, sardonic ADULT film.
I:9724;237;The characters are just fabulously intrinsic and well.
I:9724;238;It's an intense ride, but it's a ride that you need to take.
I:9724;239;"It's for ""real"" film lovers, not flash in the pan viewers who expect everyone to be young, cute and easy to read."
I:9724;240;It's as good as Pulp Fiction, but the characters are a bit more colorful.
I:9724;241;For starters this is my favorite film by director Quentin Tarantino.
I:9724;242;"Ostensibly, it's an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" but in reality it is a vehicle for one of Tarantino's favorite actresses, Pam Grier."
I:9724;243;"Much like the ""Kill Bill"" films did for Uma Thurman, Grier shines under the loving direction of Tarantino."
I:9724;244;Grier is just brilliant as the stewardess at middle.
I:9724;245;You can sense that she will be able to manipulate her way out of this sticky situation through guts and common sense.
I:9724;246;Michael Keaton delivers solid work as Ray the Fed.
I:9724;247;Tarantino delivers an effective soundtrack of vintage r'n'b.
I:9724;248;Story, dialogue, casting, music all fit together.
I:9724;249;The actors are all fine, especially Samuel L. Jackson.
I:9724;250;Enjoyed very much Tarantino humor with one foot in reality.
I:9724;251;and the other in the fantastic fantasy world.
I:9724;252;Great acting, casting, and a plot that even a dummy (like me) can follow without subtitles.
I:9724;253;I love the scene when De Niro shoots Bridget Fonda's character because she wouldn't shut up .
I:9724;254;and in the process, revived the careers of Pam Grier and Robert Forster who both were awarded with Golden Globe, SAG and Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor) nominations.
I:9724;255;"long, you'll be drawn in by the even deeper characterizations (even more than ""Pulp Fiction"")and well developed plot."
I:9724;256;All I know is NOTHING HAPPENS!
I:9724;257;I think Tarantino tried to make a cool movie.
I:9724;258;But along the way he forgot that a movie needs to tell a story.
I:9724;259;Jackie Brown is one of the most underrated movies to be released in 1997.
I:9724;260;Quentin Tarantino made a gritty adult film which featured one of the most underrated actress of the sevnties Pam Grier.
I:9724;261;Samuel L. Jackson gives a great performance and the cameo from Chris Tucker is hilarous
I:9724;262;the artwork insert is a fan's dream, with plenty of stunning photos and a small fold.
I:9724;263;Sexy Pam Grier (an excellent casting choice) carries the film in spite of notables like De Niro, Jackson, Keaton and Fonda.
I:9724;264;"A good ""she got what she wanted and they got what they deserved"" movie."
I:9724;265;Jackie Brown is the only one that I found interesting and enjoyable.
I:9724;266;I thought the storyline and the dialogue were exceptional and focused.
I:9724;267;Robert Forster and Robert Deniro give amazing performances.
I:9724;268;This movie was a wonderful way for a new generation know to Pam Grier.
I:9724;269;She embodied Jackie Brown to a T. Giving a face to the reality of a late.
I:9724;270;Great job by the incomparable Samuel Jackson.
I:9724;271;He's sly, slick and full of wit.
I:9724;272;You'll like the Chris Tucker cameo as well.
I:9724;273;Jackie Brown is a winner.
I:9724;274;It's a little corny, but if you like Quentin, it's worth watching.
I:9724;275;This is just a great movie.
I:9724;276;I have always loved it.
I:9724;277;Jackie is smart and classy and Samuel Jackson is his usual awesome self.
I:9724;278;A fun brain teaser of a flick.
I:9724;279;There's plenty of action in the movie but you have to concentrate to follow the plot!
I:9724;280;Anyone who can make Pam Grier look that good today has got to be a genius.
I:9724;281;I actually wanted to party with her after watching it.
I:9724;282;This is one of Quentin Taratino's best movies.
I:9724;283;If you're a Tarantino fan, you have to see this movie.
I:9724;284;The story is great, with the normal Tarantino twists and turns.
I:9724;285;And as usual, the music is awesome.
I:9724;286;If you love Tarantino films, you have see this one.
I:9724;287;Easily Quentin Tarantino's most mature work, which admittedly isn't saying much for a director who brought us the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique and a literal blast of adrenaline to the heart.
I:9724;288;rather, I think the true depth of their character is merely overshadowed by those visceral moments of graphic excess and their stylish methods of delivery.
I:9724;289;ups and long doses of heady silence give the impression that the plot is moving slowly, when in fact it's going roughly a mile a minute.
I:9724;290;Along the way, he subtly, efficiently grazes a gamut of emotions that leaves us deeply invested in the (often untimely) fate of each character.
I:9724;291;Rich, complex and rewarding, it's not as flashy as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it's every bit as excellent.
I:9724;292;good movie good plot .
I:9724;293;she got her own back on her bullies, they deserved it.
I:9724;294;There are alot of reviews dissing this movie, but I love this movie!!!
I:9724;295;And still a great film with great acting and direction.
I:9724;296;Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most well.
I:9724;297;"rounded movie
I:9724;298;The cast is delightful and the plot is somewhat believable.
I:9724;299;amazing, this mobie is excellent, pam grier and samuel l. jackson are great actors and the 2nd disc is full bonus.
I:9724;300;One of the best movies with a great cast and soundtrack.
I:9724;301;The collector's addition offers a lot of great material and interviews.
I:9724;302;This was a great movie.
I:9724;303;Pam Grier proved that when you got you just got it.
I:9724;304;Such a great movie and part of a great collection.
I:9724;305;I bought this as a gift and the recipient was more than pleased with the collector's edition.
I:9724;306;this movie is a classic that had to be added to the collection
I:9724;307;An excellent Quentin Tarantino movie!
I:9724;308;With Jackie Brown, Tarantino matures both as a director and a writer in his overall mastery of the world he creates.
I:9724;309;star cast of seemingly misfitted characters should be applauded, and enjoyed forever.
I:9724;310;the story is rather linear and straightforward (rare for Tarantino), and the plot, while being smartly structured, is not complex.
I:9724;311;The pure joy in watching this movie is seeing the little things the actors do in playing their parts.
I:9724;312;While watching Jackie and Max in the mall in LA, you start to believe that it's a real place.
I:9724;313;like neighborhood that Max and Ordell operate in are believable enough to be acceptable, yet puts you on guard as your characters walk through the streets.
I:9724;314;Jackie and Max's love is sweet and pure, while you see Louis and Bridget Fonda's beach bunny character as hateful and ugly.
I:9724;315;And the moment is so understated, so small, and so quick, you start to wonder was it Tarantino who told him to act in that fashion?
I:9724;316;This movie gets you involved.
I:9724;317;roger Ebert described this movie as a masterpiece, saying once the credits roll, you wish the characters could just keep interacting forever, it's just that good.
I:9724;318;It's just slow enough, just gentle enough, it eases you into the story and gives you a chance to appreciate cinema for what it is.
I:9724;319;It is a really good story, as much a mind game as The Usual Suspects or Snatch.
I:9724;320;Great memorable characters and lines.
I:9724;321;For some reason yesterday, Jackie Brown was available at Wal.
I:9724;322;And the movie is really good.
I:9724;323;Directed very well by Quentin Tarantino and stars Samuel L. Jackson (One of my favorite actors), Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, and Robert DeNiro.
I:9724;324;But watch it again and you'll fall in love.
I:9724;325;the dialogue is excellent, the comedy is subtle and true.
I:9724;326;Tarantino is my favorite director because he gives an imaginitive, almost voyeouristic look into the lives of a group of petty criminals and makes us genuinely care about their sucesses and failures in life.
I:9724;327;Tarantino brought back the rugged real gritty film.
I:9724;328;this is a movie that appreciates with each viewing.
I:9724;329;If you loved Pulp Fiction when you were young, then you should pick up Jackie Brown in a few more years and it will surely be your next favorite Tarantino movie.
I:9724;330;"tarantino says ""Jackie"" is best enjoyed with multiple viewings that allow you to ""hang out"" with the characters."
I:9724;331;a documentary brings the usual round robins of praise for the director, but the players in particular have some insightful things to say about Tarantino.
I:9724;332;"Deleted scenes collected on Jackie"" include a fascinating clip in which Grier's character coldly details her plans to scam both cops and crooks."
I:9724;333;"like mix on ""Jackie"" is especially playful, anchored by a crackling Philly soul bottom."
I:9724;334;A recent interview with QT tops the extras.
I:9724;335;rOM feature that works great.
I:9724;336;"I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" was one of the best things I had ever seen, but it will never be duplicated."
I:9724;337;"In some ways, ""Jackie Brown"" is a better movie."
I:9724;338;PF was more about action and shocking weirdness, whereas in JB, you actually care about the two main characters, played by Pam Grier, who looks great, and Robert Forster, in the role of a lifetime.
I:9724;339;Less gratuitous violence than most Tarantinos which may be good or bad depending on your tastes but well developed story and characters.
I:9724;340;QT delivers the goods once again.
I:9724;341;viewing this film over and over is like getting into a nice, hot bathtub.
I:9724;342;It simmers on the low boil, taking its time, building momentum and taking us on a very entertaining tour of LA lowlifestyle.
I:9724;343;Fonda, Keaton, Tucker and especially De Niro are wonderful acting dumb.
I:9724;344;Such a treat to see actors let loose to play to the camera with style, slyness and breathing room.
I:9724;345;I imagine that any actor who considers himself an artist would be tickled to work with QT.
I:9724;346;This movie is for the ages.
I:9724;347;Movies are in good hands with him.
I:9724;348;Well in my opinion, this is Tarantino's best piece of work.
I:9724;349;He got her career back on groove and showed off his sophistication by making this mind.
I:9724;350;paced than Pulp Fiction but I promise that if you give this film the chance it deserves you will absolutely love it!
I:9724;351;Keaton, Fonda, DeNiro, and of CORSE Samuel L. were outstanding in their roles.
I:9724;352;It is action packed and features plenty of delicious dialogue.
I:9724;353;It is funny as hell and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:9724;354;I am sure that many QT fans will complain that it isnt as good as Pulp Fiction.
I:9724;355;It is a great movie of its own accord.
I:9724;356;The acting in this movie is superb.
I:9724;357;Nobody executes Tarantino dialogue quite like Samuel L Jackson.
I:9724;358;Jackson is the most underrated actor in Hollywood.
I:9724;359;This is another brilliant performance.
I:9724;360;I dont care what Spike Lee has to say about it.
I:9724;361;Pam Grier still electrifies the screen.
I:9724;362;DeNiro and Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda all turn in sensational performances.
I:9724;363;Tarantino does seem to have a skill at drawing out top notch performances from his cast.
I:9724;364;Quentin Tarantino has produced another winner.
I:9724;365;Simply great film making with the best acting since Deniros' 1995 HEAT.
I:9724;366;ish), and absolutely amazing Robert Forster (a bail bondsman with a heart), Samuel L. Jackson (love his attitude!)
I:9724;367;Just trust me on this one, you will see things you wouldn't expect, and things you do expect will be done in ways which will blow your mind.
I:9724;368;If you realize these are standards in Tarrantino's work, then you'll see far past this, and see the great work for what it is: good writing, and superb acting.
I:9724;369;His bondsman is pure heart.
I:9724;370;"Opening Christmas Day with the tagline ""Santa's Got a Brand New Bag"", audiences were treated to QT's most natural film to date."
I:9724;371;struggling to stay cool in a modern world.
I:9724;372;This is a film to be watched, and enjoyed, multiple times.
I:9724;373;If you don't warm to his extreme genre.
I:9724;374;The image has been tweaked to give it a more warm palette, specifically regarding skin tones.
I:9724;375;top, showcasing both the fantastic dialogue and songs.
I:9724;376;"table discussion called ""Breaking Down Jackie Brown""."
I:9724;377;"The critics all love the film (including one who didn't like ""Pulp Fiction"" that much but loves this one) and their insights are all fun to hear."
I:9724;378;Other highlights include the retrospective documentary, a long interview with Tarantino where he talks about EVERYTHING, the Siskel and Ebert review, and, best of all, a huge gallery of vintage trailers featuring the two stars, Pam Grier and Robert Forster.
I:9724;379;All in all, a great edition of a film that needs to be seen by more people.
I:9724;380;Ironic then that this is the criticism laid at the door of the vastly superior Jackie Brown.
I:9724;381;well sorry but I am more than happy to remain in the minority.
I:9724;382;I have rarely been so emotionally bound up in a movie, and this is largely due to the superlative performances of Pam Grier and Robert Forster.
I:9724;383;This movie is set up to be a classic from the off, with a superb choice of Title Track laid over Griers immediate opening appearance rushing to work!
I:9724;384;I genuinely empathise with her character from this moment, and the film never forces me to let go.
I:9724;385;(Again in contrast to general opinion I found the multi.
I:9724;386;perspective shopping mall scene immensely enjoyable).
I:9724;387;For the record Samuel L. Jackson, though not moving , was, like the entire film, immensely enjoyable.
I:9724;388;I have seen this five times, and writing this only inspires me to.
I:9724;389;That's all I got to say about that
I:9724;390;Great cast too of people you already know but don't see together often.
I:9724;391;This is a good film with a great cast that paystribute to 70's films and music.
I:9724;392;ray has nicepicture and sound plus neat extras.
I:9724;393;This a Quentin Tarantino film and it has his trademark mixture of dry humor and violence.
I:9724;394;Samuel Jackson's portrayal of a dangerous drug dealer is priceless.
I:9724;395;His character is menacing and humorous at the same time.
I:9724;396;bright sidekick is an unusual for him and first rate.
I:9724;397;Pam Grier's performance matches Jackson's and Robert Forster gives an understated and good performance as the bail bondsman who joins with Grier in foiling Jackson's character.
I:9724;398;If you liked Tarantino's Pulp Fiction with its emphasis on off beat characters and humor, then you will appreciate Jackie Brown.
I:9724;399;As with most Elmore Leonard books.
I:9724;400;Elmore's material is so very good, even Tarantino can't mess it up too badly.
I:9724;401;I thought that this blu .
I:9724;402;Jackie Brown a Quentin Tarantino film is one of those films that brings an assorment of good acting talent laced with rare but good 70 music and feroicus dialouge, the problem is they did not blend well together thus making the storyline long, boring and played out long before the credits roll.
I:9724;403;star cast in this Hitchcockian story full of crisp, fresh and witty dialogue and twists and turns.
I:9724;404;All the actors in this play their role perfectly, the plots great, its a drama that will have you laughing.
I:9724;405;The people depicted in this movie are hilarious and yet three dimensional, and so recognizable, The setting in the every day streets of Los Angeles and the music score set a perfect atmosphere for the great story, and sharp intelligent dialogue, I could watch this movie a hundred times and never tire of it.
I:9724;406;It's a movie with a lot more nuance than most of what I've seen from Quentin.
I:9724;407;PAM GRIER is PERFECT (it is really great to see her again, and she looks absolutely spectacular).
I:9724;408;But, Tarantino elevates to 5 stars.
I:9724;409;He's really GOOD at what he does.
I:9724;410;Great movie and great service.
I:9724;411;A great movie made from the story of a great book.
I:9724;412;I love how Q. t. adds so much of the 70's feel to this movie.
I:9724;413;The story made sure all the characters played an important part to the outcome of this movie.
I:9724;414;People of all ages will enjoy this one.
I:9724;415;"That suit looks really cool ""Yeah and it looks cool on me"""
I:9724;416;Samuel L. Jackson is phenominal as the too cool for school arms dealer Ordell, Bridgitte Fonda is hot and funny as Melanie, and DiNiro is great as always as ex.
I:9724;417;I love all Tarantino`s movies and with this movie I used Prime videos for first time.
I:9724;418;I loved this movie, and not just because I share a name with the title character, but Samuel L. Jackson was incredible.
I:9724;419;This movie, although it had a substantial amount of strong language, had classy and fun dialogue, full of quotable lines.
I:9724;420;Quenton Tarantino's twisty adaptation of Rum Punch was fantastic.
I:9724;421;character, playing the supporting role as a total doped out loser, but he was very fun to watch and he added a lot to the movie.
I:9724;422;Michael Keaton (as always) brought a lot of humor and life to the movie, and Bridget Fonda has never looked so good.
I:9724;423;This is certainly not a family values movie, but maybe something that college age friends can enjoy.
I:9724;424;This was a great movie though, and if for no other reason, see it for Samuel L. Jackson's memorable performance.
I:9724;425;Michael Keaton surprised me with his role.
I:9724;426;Tarantino is a lot less surprising and fascinating in this film than he was in some others.
I:9724;427;In fact it is as clear and precise as a flight schedule.
I:9724;428;But the plot is intricate and so complicated that we have some pleasure in having difficulties to follow it.
I:9724;429;ups and to report themselves as successful in bringing their target down, but what is their target ?
I:9724;430;Entertaining for sure though without the glamour and the power of the past.
I:9724;431;Tarrantino showed his maturity in this film, assembling a very fine cast in a wry transformation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch.
I:9724;432;Grier, who made her career in such blaxploitation movies as Coffy and Foxy Brown, gives a star performance in this film.
I:9724;433;She is well balanced by Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell, a two.
I:9724;434;bit drug dealer, and Robert Forster, who turns in a remarkably understated performance as Max Cherry, a bail bondsman.
I:9724;435;But those used to Tarrantino's high octane films may be disappointed with this one, but I found it to be a very enjoyable departure from his usual fare.
I:9724;436;Love all of Robert De Niros movies.
I:9724;437;Jackie Brown is by far by favorite Tarantino film.
I:9724;438;"Resevoir Dogs was good, ""Pulp Fiction"" was great and ""Kill Bill"" was a masterpiece but somehow ""Jackie Brown"" is better."
I:9724;439;Flawless acting and and a spectacualr screenplay based on a good novel make this one of the best films of all time in my opinion.
I:9724;440;(My recomendation&oplnion)well ,everybody has one!
I:9724;441;The story is good, and the acting is good.
I:9724;442;I thought DeNiro was the highlight of the film.
I:9724;443;(He also said it was going to be a 2.
I:9724;444;"In comes Jackie Brown (Pam Grier
I:9724;445;Excellent casting, especially Robert Forster who earned an Academy Award Nomination, (I thought Samuel L Jackson was going to get nominated at least, he deserved it).
I:9724;446;Recently, I immersed myself in a blacksploitation festival of close to a dozen films from the early 1970s.
I:9724;447;In this, his third film, Quentin Tarantino pays homage to the genre's roots while giving us something better than the best that era had to offer.
I:9724;448;Tarantino revived John Travolta's career withPulp Fiction, and he did the same thing here for both Grier and Robert Forster, the latter often shot in macro close.
I:9724;449;star supporting cast in small but often critical roles.
I:9724;450;From the opening credits of Bobby Womack's Across 110th Street to Randy Crawford's Street Life, the sounds of this movie are in keeping with its spirit and with its visual authenticity.5 stars all the way, sista girl!
I:9724;451;This movie will entertain you from start to finish,the music is genius, and the casting was calculated, in the Tarantino style.
I:9724;452;Watching Deniro, in a supporting role takes some getting use to, he pulls it off with class and artistry.
I:9724;453;If I would have paid to see this on the big screen I would have walked out feeling like I got my moneys worth, that is very rare.
I:9724;454;This is hands down Tarrantino's best film.
I:9724;455;"His hyper stylish crime thriller ""Reservoir Dogs"" caught the eye of film fans and Tinseltown big shots back in the early 1990s, and ""Pulp Fiction"" sent his popularity soaring."
I:9724;456;Critics gave this film a cool reception, and fan reaction was equally mixed.
I:9724;457;But I also think this film is a massively entertaining picture well worth watching.
I:9724;458;"Besides, ""Jackie Brown"" stars Pam Grier, and I love Pam Grier."
I:9724;459;She works for Cabo Airlines, one of those fly by night operations that gives jobs to people who can't get a job anywhere else, and she uses her position to engage in several shady money laundering operations run by Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).
I:9724;460;jackie Brown is a very intelligent woman with more cunning than a dozen crime bosses.
I:9724;461;Through it all, Jackie Brown navigates her way across obstacles with the tenacity of a woman with nothing left to lose in life, and she looks great doing it.
I:9724;462;"when ""Jackie Brown"" works, it works wonders."
I:9724;463;one of the songs that plays in the movie is a tune sung by Grier for one of her earliest films, and he hired Grier's longtime screen partner Sid Haig to play a judge.
I:9724;464;Two important things become obvious when comparing Grier's earlier work with her performance here: she's become a much better actress and she's even more beautiful now.
I:9724;465;Grier conveys complex emotions with a look, a slight movement, and an inflection of her voice.
I:9724;466;And she manages to pull it off while looking drop dead gorgeous.
I:9724;467;Grier is so good in the movie that it is easy to overlook the effectiveness of Forster and Jackson.
I:9724;468;Both men turn in bravura performances, especially Forster as a lonely man who falls in love with Jackie.
I:9724;469;It's stuffed with so many interesting extras.
I:9724;470;the Chicks with Guns video we see in the movie is here in all its hilarious glory.
I:9724;471;Anther Tarantino classic with thePulp Fiction feel to it.
I:9724;472;Michael Keaton great as the ATF agent, Samuel Jackson great as usual, unusual character for DeNiro, a classic.
I:9724;473;perfect combination for a great story with great dialogue.
I:9724;474;And I love Pam Grier as the main character.
I:9724;475;"If you were to take this film, and compare it to Tarantino's earlier work, you'd never guess they came from the same director and yes baby he did a great job with ""Jackie."""
I:9724;476;This is one of those films which is strange but yet captivating.
I:9724;477;Now it's a nice plot of how Ordell wants the half a million dollars he has coming to him with these arms deals and how Jackie Brown is the only connection between Ordell and the police and Cherry.
I:9724;478;this movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Forster) and many good reviews.
I:9724;479;The whole ensemble is incredibly well casted and deserves to be recognized.
I:9724;480;however, this movie is uniquely Quentin T. and exhibits his versatile film making style.
I:9724;481;When he directs he allows his imagination free rein to experiment and explore.
I:9724;482;"Each of his directorial efforts has been unique, and ""Jackie Brown"" is another successful experiment."
I:9724;483;This movie does have great dialogue.
I:9724;484;Both men have quite a talent for what they do.
I:9724;485;i have the soundtrack and just loved it.
I:9724;486;If you own it you will see how great the songs fit in and the dialogue.
I:9724;487;"discovery, thank you Quentin), and Jackie's car is playing ""Street life!"""
I:9724;488;At the end of this, all the adventures and bizarre paths taken by these characters converge into a great film.
I:9724;489;What more can I say but to highly recommended this film along with the soundtrack.
I:9724;490;This is one of my favorite Tarantino films, Samuel L. Jackson's role in this movie is not his typical role and the entire movie is fantastic.
I:9724;491;The movies have nothing to do with one another, and Jackie Brown stands alone as a superb crime drama, based on Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.
I:9724;492;The cast is outstanding, from Samuel L. Jackson's ultra.
I:9724;493;The rest of the movie is so excellent, though, that a few slow scenes can be overlooked and won't detract from my 5.
I:9724;494;full of extras, commentary, and information (including a retro movie poster!)
I:9724;495;great actors like Samuel L Jackson, Pam Grier and Robert de Niro, shouldn't have risked their prestige for a piece of trash.
I:9724;496;please don't expect a romantic film or a superproduction, but an exciting film of the life of one human being that found herself involved in a big trouble, dressed with such wonderfull actors and directed in such a creative way by Quentin Tarantino.
I:9724;497;if you like creative characters Jackie Brown is a smart character and I adore the way she solve her problems.
I:9724;498;I gave Tarantino a chance and he blew it big time.
I:9724;499;"conformist, but I prefer ""Jackie Brown"" to ""Pulp Fiction."""
I:9724;500;jackie Brown proves that Tarantino knows more about filmmaking than only his trademark style.
I:9724;501;It proves that he can take an Elmore Leonard novel, give it the old 70's funk feel, and at the same time justify the characters.
I:9724;502;driven one, and it is more linear than Tarantino's previous films.
I:9724;503;Everyone is confident of their plans for the money, but Jackie, with the help of Max, gets the best of them and plays out everyone with her plan.
I:9724;504;tarantino made sure that scenes played out well, and they did.
I:9724;505;We can always enjoy great films from Tarantino.
I:9724;506;This is one of those films I have heard about, but never watched until last week.
I:9724;507;I am not a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, but I enjoyed it.
I:9724;508;I like Elmore Leonard stories, the acting was very good, and I liked the sound track.
I:9724;509;I would recommend for Tarantino collectors.
I:9724;510;A novel based on a true story.
I:9724;511;Hidden under a canopy of old oak trees drapped in spanish moss the beauty of this old place immediately arrests Sali's imagination and wonderous curiosity, and his heart is intoxicated with his first love.
I:9724;512;Jackie Brown (Grier) is a sexy stewardess trying to make something good (how about a half.
I:9724;513;I know it sounds confusing, but it's really quite fun.
I:9724;514;I was pleasantly suprised the first time I viewed it and each time after that.
I:9724;515;i have never been a huge fan of Mr. Tarantino's films.
I:9724;516;sexy, sassy, strong, sophisticated, smart, etc.
I:9724;517;Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely hilarious throughout as the film's villian, and this is one of his best performances.
I:9724;518;There is a scene between he and Chris Tucker (in a cameo role) that is so funny it brings me to tears everytime I view it.
I:9724;519;Deniro is also great as SLJ's neer.
I:9724;520;well right hand man (then again, when isn't he great?)
I:9724;521;The whole cast is terrific!
I:9724;522;He really makes you feel for his character and it's almost impossible to not like him.
I:9724;523;It was nice to see the Academy acknowledge his performance with an Oscar nomination for his supporting role (he should have won though!)
I:9724;524;overall, the film is excellent.
I:9724;525;I also enjoyed the great 70's music!
I:9724;526;I am a huge fan of Elmore Leonard, the author of Rum Punch, the novel on which this movie was based, so naturally, I had high expectations.
I:9724;527;Robert Forster is EXCELLENT, deserving of the Oscar nomination.
I:9724;528;Samuel L. Jackson once again steals the show, he dominates every scene.
I:9724;529;Every scene sizzles, the music is PERFECT, the camera angles are brilliant, and the dialogue is a non.
I:9724;530;and all four movies are treasures, each as enjoyable to me as the others.
I:9724;531;Pronto is one of my favorites and it would make a spectacular movie, since over half of the story takes place in Italy on the Meditteranean.
I:9724;532;I'll keep my fingers crossed.
I:9724;533;and a tour de force for Pam Grier and Samuel Jackson.
I:9724;534;"perfect adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" delivers the goods."
I:9724;535;"With its cheeky dialogue, blasts of violence, and an eccentric gallery of characters, ""Jackie Brown"" exemplifies the kind of robust, genuinely thrilling material a Tarantino."
I:9724;536;Grier and Jackson make excellent, illicit adversaries, and the supporting cast, including De Niro as Ordell's pothead partner and Fonda as a sun.
I:9724;537;guy love interest earned him an Oscar nod.
I:9724;538;Classic MovieMust see for fans
I:9724;539;The acting is pretty good and it has a great cast but the movie has a very slow plot.
I:9724;540;This movie is no way near the greatness of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp fiction but it is still a pretty decent movie.
I:9724;541;Samuel Jackson is a great actor and continues to show why he is the badest you know what on the planet.
I:9724;542;The film has a great soundtrack that really sets a tone for what type of movie it is.You can recognize some odd angles that tarrintino has used in all his movies and he still has put some funny dialogue in his film.
I:9724;543;The movie surrounds Pam Grier, previously treated in movies as an object for sex, with an outstanding supporting cast and allows her to show us that she really can act.
I:9724;544;Plus a beautifully nuanced love story involving the bail bondsman who helps her.
I:9724;545;If your a Tarantino fan its a must see.
I:9724;546;Beyond that I'd recommend this to a fan of crime thrillers or those who enjoy mysteries and character development.
I:9724;547;Be sure to reserve a decent block of time for this film due to its 2 hour+ run time.
I:9724;548;This film is well paced and the casting is spot on.
I:9724;549;"I saw ""Jackie Brown"" for the first time a few days ago, and I loved it."
I:9724;550;i think that the casting was superb, and I got a good laugh when I saw Beaumont (Chris Tucker) argue with Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), and many other laughs out of almost every scene that Samuel L. Jackson was in (it seems that these are always his best roles, but I cannot complain, because I think that Ordell was one of the coolest movie characters in the history of film).
I:9724;551;The casting of other greats like Pam Grier and Robert De Niro (although his role was minor in the film, a few of his scenes were superb, like the car park and his scenes in Melanie's house) were great choices, and they all played their characters well.
I:9724;552;Tarantino is a great filmmaker and each of his movies have their merits, but Jackie Brown is the one he made for me.
I:9724;553;Pam Grier and Robert Forster are over 50 and sexy.
I:9724;554;There are just a handful of movies that deserve 5 stars to me but this one easily earned 4.
I:9724;555;And his style is overhyped over the top.
I:9724;556;Nice performances by her and Glover.
I:9724;557;robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson and Quentin Tarantino do a great job in this crime thriller.
I:9724;558;This ranks up there as one of Taratino's best Films.
I:9724;559;The Charaters were great with the right amount of violence and suspense.
I:9724;560;This is the 3rd Tarantino film and it stands out as its own movie.
I:9724;561;This is a very soulful movie about survival in all of it's forms.
I:9724;562;Bottom line though, this movie holds up because it is a well told, thoroughly engrossing, incredibly well acted story.
I:9724;563;Robert Deniro is hilarious, Sam Jackson is evil incarnate, and Robert Forster and Pam Grier are positively luminous.
I:9724;564;This is a very worthy and entertaining film.
I:9724;565;One of those movies I watched on a lark though not having heard of it, and loved it.
I:9724;566;In addition to the suspense of the con, has great QT characters and even a well done love angle.
I:9724;567;"I loved this film, from Samual L Jackson's whacky pony tail to Bridget Fonda's sexy beach girl, de Niro is great as the ""dont push me cause I'm close to the edge"" Lewis and the black Femme Fatale ."
I:9724;568;great soul soundtrack, pacy plot, immpeccably casted and scripted .
I:9724;569;why is it not 5 stars?Well despite all of the above all we get is entertainment, which is fine but dont expect any philosophy or meaning here, it is just 100% good fun.
I:9724;570;This is a great Quentin Tarantino movie by all means.
I:9724;571;The dialoge is good, the acting is good, the story is good and it is shot very good.
I:9724;572;For the people who don't really like the Tarantino violence then this is a good flick for you.
I:9724;573;I know Pulp Fiction is long but that movie is getting places and its enjoyable to watch the characters doing everyday stuff and its exciting to watch them for a long time (Ex.
I:9724;574;It's still a great movie and it's very much worth it to wait for the great ending.
I:9724;575;Quentin Tarantino is my hero and I love his movies.
I:9724;576;He has inspired me to becoe a film maker.
I:9724;577;Pam Grier is marvelous in this movie.
I:9724;578;Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Robert DeNiro, and much more, by bringing this movie in your home, it fits right along with Pulp Fiction, Dead Presidents and Spike Lee's Malcolm X.
I:9724;579;Q. t is one of the best directors.
I:9724;580;You watch him speak about his art in interviews, and while I realize what I'm responding to might simply be a cleverly.
I:9724;581;wrought public persona, his energy and enthusiasm for his craft is just so infectious that one cannot help but be energized too.
I:9724;582;That energy certainly carries over into his movies, and while he may not be the most thrillingly visual director, his undeniable gift for dialogue more than compensates in his films.
I:9724;583;"pULP FICTION, as of now, is my favorite movie
I:9724;584;up to PF, is just as good as PF, if not quite its superior.
I:9724;585;moving (the above Editorial Review calls it decaffeinated ).
I:9724;586;Sure, the plot of this movie certainly could become a taut, exciting thriller under another director's hands.
I:9724;587;"well, the characters' dialogue is consistently full of life
I:9724;588;(Another Elmore Leonard adaptation, Steven Soderbergh's OUT OF SIGHT, took a similarly leisurely approach to its crime plot, and it worked just as well in that film, too.)
I:9724;589;In short, JACKIE BROWN is an underrated Tarantino masterpiece.
I:9724;590;It may not be quite the film PULP FICTION is (since it had a more palpably energetic feel to it, despite both films' running 154 minutes), but it is certainly a worthy follow.
I:9724;591;This is one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:9724;592;Everytime I watch it the high is as if I'm watching it for the first time again.
I:9724;593;It's so enjoyable in every way.
I:9724;594;It's jam packed with some truly amazing characters, great story that takes its time to happen.
I:9724;595;You're enjoying the journey and following the wonderful dynamic between all these people.
I:9724;596;Jackie Brown is almost a great movie.
I:9724;597;Still, there is so much that is absolutley right with the movie that it is definitely worth a look.
I:9724;598;:) Amazing characters, dialogue, plot, actors .
I:9724;599;Jackie Brown marked the bigtime return of Pam Grier.
I:9724;600;Luckily I got to see this in the theatre.
I:9724;601;She is as beautiful as in the Coffy days.
I:9724;602;If you're a Tarantino fan, you need to see this one.
I:9724;603;"It's an example of what a great director and talented actors can do with a ""quiet"" movie (very few gun battles and car chases)."
I:9724;604;Pam Grier is still beautiful and she plays her part well.
I:9724;605;i really enjoyed this movie, the plot is really slick and its on my top 25 list.
I:9724;606;dialogue, casting and acting is great!
I:9724;607;Robert Deniro's role is funny.
I:9724;608;Let me first say that 'Jackie Brown' is an incredible film.
I:9724;609;looking heist film, and instead made an interesting character film with a heist going on in the background.
I:9724;610;characters: This is really Quentin's great talent.
I:9724;611;Sure, there's no question about his knack for writing dialogue, but the dialogue works for two other reasons: 1) the characters are so strong, 2) the acting is so good.
I:9724;612;His talent really is in making the characters and in the way he tells the story through them.
I:9724;613;This film could have been driven by the heist plot and been a great film.
I:9724;614;But what Quentin achieved here, to me, was both refreshing and unexpected.
I:9724;615;Watching it now, after having viewed the 'Kill Bill's and having seen 'Jackie Brown' a number of times, I can appreciate some of the things I missed when I first watched this film upon its original release in 1997.
I:9724;616;this is definately a film that grows with time.
I:9724;617;There is so much in these characters that each subsequent viewing is a delight.
I:9724;618;Now they just take it from working people and give it to her kind.
I:9724;619;It is wonderful to think that the lesser stars of the film Jackie Brown, Pam Grier and Robert Forster, emerge as the dazzling talent and that the major stars, Robert DeNiro, Samuel Jackson, Michael Keaton, and Bridget Fonda, are left to make the very best of their minor roles.
I:9724;620;Fortunately, all of the players, and they are all the best, have successfully combined their efforts to make Jackie Brown one of the greatest films of the Nineties.
I:9724;621;Perhaps this is due to the fact that Max Cherry is one of the few true gentlemen that Jackie Brown has ever encountered in her unenviable forty.
I:9724;622;max is instantly attracted to the lovely and charming Jackie Brown while maintaining a wise detachment from the brilliant and audacious scheme she concocts to turn her misfortune into a small fortune while helping the police to put Ordell away in prison permanently.
I:9724;623;Max is the right blend of decency and analytical intelligence to appeal to Jackie's street.
I:9724;624;the plot of this film is intricate, intriguing from the first second, and best experienced as it unfolds on the screen.
I:9724;625;mouthed witty patois of Ordell, the script is beautifully written and provides the basis of the flawless characterizations by each actor.
I:9724;626;Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Ordell's newly.
I:9724;627;In fact, one has to look twice to make sure that it is Robert DeNiro.
I:9724;628;Bridget Fonda shines in her small role as Melanie, one of Ordell's stable of unambitious kept women.
I:9724;629;the pace of Jackie Brown follows the story in perfect cadence.
I:9724;630;jackie Brown is the tale of love and luck.
I:9724;631;I orderd it and it came on time.
I:9724;632;If this is how minority people live, or even what they think is entertaining, there's absolutely no question in my mind why their relative arrest records are so high.
I:9724;633;Always a great movie to sit back and watch .
I:9724;634;I remember watching this years ago, now that I own .
I:9724;635;it is nice to watch once again.
I:9724;636;Jackie Brown has something for everyone.
I:9724;637;The music is fantastic too.
I:9724;638;The cast is top notch.
I:9724;639;If you like Tarantino films you will enjoy this one.
I:9724;640;There were a few fuzzy scenes in the movie.
I:9724;641;what a great film by a great director.
I:9724;642;the dialogue is superb, as well as the acting.
I:9724;643;grabbing from the beginning to the end and the acting superb!
I:9724;644;Quintin T. is a great director and I love Pam G.
I:9724;645;it was a great movie i love every bit off it was worth every penny ive wacht it 3 times and let all my frends use it thank you
I:9724;646;"Let me begin by saying that, in my opinion, ""Jackie Brown"" was one of the top films of 1997."
I:9724;647;"It was a tough year, though, with ""Titanic"" winning 11 awards, and the likes of ""Good Will Hunting"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Amistad"", ""Boogie Nights"", and ""L. a. Confidential"" scooping up the rest."
I:9724;648;Pam Grier should have won Best Actress, hands down.
I:9724;649;"deserved one for Robert Forster as Best Supporting Actor (as bail/bondsman Max Cherry, in a performance that revitalized his career, as I predict Albert Brooks will benefit from his excellent work in ""Drive"" last year)."
I:9724;650;"quentin Tarantino borrowed his story from Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"", and crafted a screenplay that is well."
I:9724;651;timed, taut, often surprising, and even sweet at times.
I:9724;652;"But, I suspect quite intentionally, Tarantino designed ""Jackie Brown"" as a golden, fleur."
I:9724;653;trimmed letterbox for Pam Grier to turn the title character into one of the most memorable in the last quarter.
I:9724;654;And, that's exactly what she did.
I:9724;655;bridget Fonda is so absolutely perfect as gun.
I:9724;656;And the other characters that spice up the plot are all well.
I:9724;657;Like a swirling, cool, evening fog by the waterfront on a steamy, summer evening, it is hard to define and even harder to grasp, but you know you like it.
I:9724;658;fan by the end of the film.
I:9724;659;ray is excellent, both visually and aurally.
I:9724;660;With few exceptions, I believe that it is always worthwhile to do so if you care for a film as part of your collection, rather than just having it around to watch from time to time.
I:9724;661;"give ""Jackie Brown"" a chance and take it for what it is: a love story between two well."
I:9724;662;grounded adults that takes a while to develop.
I:9724;663;"When the feds to bust her, she is strong and brilliant in her presentation to the feds and the one that she is ""carrying"" for."
I:9724;664;"The story does take alot of twists and turns as to who is going to make it out ""on top""."
I:9724;665;I recommend this movie to all QT fans and also those that like twists and turns in movies.
I:9724;666;Great movie with a ton of special features.
I:9724;667;I'm glad I bought the two.
I:9724;668;Watched Jackie Brown on TV a while back and forgot what a classic it is.
I:9724;669;but the pace, acting is top notch.
I:9724;670;Not a kid movie for sure but it's a great one for a library.
I:9724;671;Blue ray is great .
I:9724;672;the case is retro 70's poster style.
I:9724;673;The pop cultre master has made another perfect film, and put simply this guy is the man.
I:9724;674;She doesn't like her job alot, but it pays her bills and lets her work.
I:9724;675;He has $500,000 in Mexico and he's slowly smuggling it into the U. s. with Jackie bringing in some on each of her trips.
I:9724;676;He offers to help her in any way that he can.
I:9724;677;Jackie being the smart woman she is knows Ordell wants her dead.
I:9724;678;That's the master tail of Jackie Brown.
I:9724;679;this movie has the perfect cast in it.
I:9724;680;Once again Tarantino puts the perfects cast there and everyone shines.
I:9724;681;They all hold their own with each other and they all give a memorable performance.
I:9724;682;Tarantion has written the perfect script and the dialouge in the movie is perfect.
I:9724;683;samuel L. Jackson is the man.
I:9724;684;I laughed so hard watching his performance.
I:9724;685;His character Ordell might be my favorite one that he has ever played.
I:9724;686;You just have to love it.
I:9724;687;robert Forrester gives the most memorable performance of the film.
I:9724;688;He deserved his Oscar nomination and should have one it.
I:9724;689;That holds true in this.
I:9724;690;You just love his performance.
I:9724;691;You can read the sadness in his eyes in one scene, then see the absolute joy in them in another.
I:9724;692;He should have one the Oscar and this is one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie.
I:9724;693;the rest of the cast is great.
I:9724;694;Pam Grier rocks in the lead role as the sassy middle aged black woman.
I:9724;695;I like Grier a lot and this is her at her best.
I:9724;696;I loved the Chicks with Guns video.
I:9724;697;All the specials on the making are great.
I:9724;698;Tarantino had a blast making it, and the interviews are great with him.
I:9724;699;There are a ton of extras.
I:9724;700;This is an influential movie, and without it I don't think we'd have some of the crime robbery thrillers that have been popular the last couple of years.
I:9724;701;Quentin Taranturo has done pretty well for a boy from Tennessee.
I:9724;702;"His cult status began in 1992 with ""Reservoir Dogs."""
I:9724;703;"Pulp Fiction brought in the vast majority of that income, which indicates that ""Jackie Brown"" displeased many fans."
I:9724;704;"I do know that ""Jackie Brown"" is a more mature and sensitive work."
I:9724;705;The fact that Elsmore Leonard, who wrote the book the script is based on, was one of the film's producers may have had a positive effect on Taranturo.
I:9724;706;"In any case, ""Jackie Brown"" is a splendid work."
I:9724;707;ms. Grier plays Jackie Brown with a grace and a dignity which is rarely seen on the screen these days.
I:9724;708;Just like her character, Grier is a true survivor.
I:9724;709;The result has been an ever increasing number of good roles.
I:9724;710;This is a woman who knows much about living.
I:9724;711;"while he plays the bad guy most of the time, anyone who saw ""Eve's Bayou"", which he both starred in and produced, knows he's a man of rare intelligence and insight."
I:9724;712;jackson also has a sense of humor.
I:9724;713;Good luck, Robert!Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro and Michael Bowen are all excellent in supporting roles.
I:9724;714;Just don't forget I said this movie is deceptively complex.
I:9724;715;I will give you one hint: Never take your eyes off Jackie Brown.
I:9724;716;This device works very well.
I:9724;717;Jackie Brown is certainly not Tarantino's best but it is amusing.
I:9724;718;As in pretty much every movie Samuel L Jackson plays a pretty important part as a gunrunner.
I:9724;719;He lives in a LA house with the very hot Bridget Fonda.
I:9724;720;A friend who just came out of jail lives with him and helps him.
I:9724;721;This is absolutely the funniest character in the movie, played by De Niro.
I:9724;722;key to the movie is Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, the smartest person in the movie because she can play both sides, the feds and the criminals and ends up with a lot of dough.
I:9724;723;not a super movie and with 150 minutes definitely too long, but still fun.
I:9724;724;I'm glad I finally did because I think it is one of his best.
I:9724;725;The characters in this story are great and so are the performances.
I:9724;726;This is my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie, and it is the best of all the film versions of an Elmore Leonard novel.
I:9724;727;In the book, he is described as a light skinned black man).
I:9724;728;Jackie Brown has ideas of her own, though.
I:9724;729;tarantino strikes the exact right tone to capture the smart, realistic writing of Leonard.
I:9724;730;So many great actors got their due in this film, and justly so, primarily the great Pam Grier, playing Jackie Brown.
I:9724;731;I have always loved Pam Grier (who doesn't?)
I:9724;732;It was also great to see Robert Forester, who turns in a performance so subtle and assured it makes you grieve he doesn't get more work.
I:9724;733;One of Tarantino's great strengths as a filmmaker is his shrewd casting of under appreciated actors and putting them in perfect roles where they shine.
I:9724;734;He did it for John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, and he does it again with both forester and Grier.
I:9724;735;in lesser roles, but no less interesting, Michael Keaton displayed great control and reserve as a very convincing ATF Agent, and Bridget Fonda was perfect as Melanie, a girl with a lot of attitude and none of it good.
I:9724;736;As for Samuel L. Jackson, suffice to say that one of the greatest character actors in film history turns in another gem.
I:9724;737;As the filmmaker himself has said, he wished to make a film for grown ups.
I:9724;738;great acting and captures the genre well.
I:9724;739;and that's a good thing.
I:9724;740;"acted film
I:9724;741;It contains all the great dialogue of an Elmore Leonard novel, and the greatest sounds of the 70's music since Reservior Dogs.
I:9724;742;the best description I could manage for the movie for this film is Out of Sight without the excessive gloss.
I:9724;743;Speaking of Foxy Brown, Pam Grier gives what has to be her best performance ever in this film.
I:9724;744;"While Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro continue to show us how why they are great actors
I:9724;745;made Elmore Leonard movie, made by a great director who loves the 70's as much as he does making good movies, this is for you.
I:9724;746;The cast has been ingeniously assembled and everone has their moment to shine.
I:9724;747;I was not familiar with Pam Grier from her early days but clearly Tarantino remembered and gave her a gift of a role.
I:9724;748;as others have mentioned, the pace is slow at times but that allows the viewer to let the juicy dialogue soak in and allows the characters to all make significant contributions.
I:9724;749;ray looks and sounds terrific.
I:9724;750;tarantino has become so popular and so successful in so little time.
I:9724;751;He is a gifted director as well as one hell of a writer.
I:9724;752;It was very easy to follow.
I:9724;753;"Just keep this in mind: If you liked ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" chances are that you will enjoy this movie as well."
I:9724;754;"this movie has one hell of a cast
I:9724;755;Pam is terrific, of course.
I:9724;756;"Unlike ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this movie is very colorful."
I:9724;757;"the extras are there, and there are plenty of them
I:9724;758;"Although I still consider ""Pulp Fiction"" to be Tarantino's best film, ""Jackie Brown"" is a triumph and a breathtaking movie."
I:9724;759;This has slowly become my favorite movie of all time.
I:9724;760;Grier is lovely and cocky in the title role, and Sam Jackson as Ordell.
I:9724;761;gets more and more evil every time I see him!
I:9724;762;DeNiro is sublime as Louis, an ex.
I:9724;763;Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful as the bail bondsman, Jackie's tool to get $500,000!
I:9724;764;"The is a great movie based on the novel ""Rum Punch"" who's main character is a caucasian stewardess working for an arms and drug dealer."
I:9724;765;She transfers funds from the U. s. to Mexico.
I:9724;766;Quentin Tarantino's homage to the blaxplotation films of the 70's is his vision here casting noone other than the Queen herself Pam Grier in the title role.
I:9724;767;"Smart, Funny, and music by "" THE DELFONICS""."
I:9724;768;It may not have the frenetic pace of Pulp Fiction, but the construction of this film is tight and compelling.
I:9724;769;The pace is delicious and Tarantino captures the pulpy charm and economy of Elmore Leonard's crisp writing.
I:9724;770;The casting is perfect from top to bottom.
I:9724;771;He couldn't have hired a better acting ensemble to pull this off, to wit, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Sammy J., Bobby D., Brigid F., Chris Tucker, Michael K., etc. for starters, I think this is the best performance of Pam G's career: she exhibits a multi.
I:9724;772;Notice how she effortlessly segues from the street.
I:9724;773;savvy demeanor whilst in the company of Sammy J., etc., to the middle.
I:9724;774;She shows how tight her game really is and isn't afraid to do whatever it takes to pull off her intended caper.
I:9724;775;bondsman, effortlessly mixes in well with people of color without being obsequious or trying to be hip: He is merely himself and lets that fact set the tone for whatever may ensue.
I:9724;776;quentin T's usually crisp directorial skills are in evidence here, as his cutting in and moving back and forth in time work very well.
I:9724;777;All that and an awesome, cleverly positioned soundtrack that kicks much booty!
I:9724;778;This is my favorite Quentin T. film: ya gotta check it out!
I:9724;779;so I am over here at the PC while they toke up and watch but I still got a good view.
I:9724;780;"People, listen, this is one of those rare gems that is actually too good for most Pulp Fiction groupies to respect, because like Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown escapes Tarantino's tight grip on ""cool trophy of the century"" mentality."
I:9724;781;Jackie Brown is simply brilliant.
I:9724;782;If you are looking for an action packed movie like Pulp Fiction, look else.
I:9724;783;core action as Pulp Fiction.
I:9724;784;Great scripting and writing, worth watching!
I:9724;785;Great movie and a little less known than some of the other Tarrintino movies.
I:9724;786;If you love Pulp Fiction, Resivior Dogs, Kill Bill, Django Unchained you will like this movie Tarrintino keeps getting better and his movies are always worth it on Blu Ray period.
I:9724;787;great performances by Samuel L Jackson and Pam Grier.
I:9724;788;I also enjoyed a lot of the music.
I:9724;789;More character driven than most of Tarantino's work, JB's dialogue, music and acting take this effort to the top!Outstanding performances from Greer and Forster as well as supporting cast.
I:9724;790;I waited a long time to see Jackie Brown , because I heard it wasn't any good, and I didn't want to tarnish the memory of Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction .
I:9724;791;Both those films were kinetic, profane, daring, and truly visceral experiences.
I:9724;792;I loved every minute of them.
I:9724;793;key, thoughtful, tender, and assured.
I:9724;794;And, I must say, just as good.
I:9724;795;Pulp Fiction was about young, experienced criminals, always on the go, always in control.
I:9724;796;It's actually kind of a touching, and very odd, moment to have in the middle of what should be a zippy little heist flick.
I:9724;797;But it is kind of refreshing to see a director, especially one who's made his name off it, not rely on the showy exploitation of shooting someone.
I:9724;798;which brings me to the most intriguing thing about this movie.
I:9724;799;Tarantino, who the rap on in recent years has been that he's tormented by his early success and hasn't the confidence to make his next picture, actually shows a very assured hand in making this movie.
I:9724;800;Because he's cast DeNiro in a tiny, stoical role.
I:9724;801;in a role that's very meaty, the tortured love.
I:9724;802;assured director would have switched the two actors, but Tarantino knows what he wants, and boy does he get it.
I:9724;803;And Forster steals the show with his laid.
I:9724;804;and Forster's scenes with Jackie Brown are touching, chemistry.
I:9724;805;filled, and a joy to watch.
I:9724;806;Credit in this case should go to Pam Grier, as Jackie Brown, another Tarantino casting coup.
I:9724;807;Grier is asked to be maturely sexy, street.
I:9724;808;smart, tough, and vulnerable all at once.
I:9724;809;I suspect that Tarantino has fantasized most of his life about casting Pam Grier in a movie, and would have done so even if the role didn't suit her so.
I:9724;810;the rest of the cast is good in their own rights.
I:9724;811;Sam Jackson was born to speak Tarantino's dialogue, and doesn't disappoint.
I:9724;812;He makes Ordell a genuine badass, even through his ponytail and silly little beard (and Jackson, bless his heart, even throws in a nod to my home town basketball team, the Toronto Raptors).
I:9724;813;Bridget Fonda is actually quite sexy as a layabout surfer chick, whose big mouth is bound to get her into trouble.
I:9724;814;And Michael Keaton, who I've always thought of as a very underrated and interesting actor, plays his ATF agent with just enough faux.
I:9724;815;cool and indifference that you're always wondering if he's playing Jackie or if Jackie's playing him.
I:9724;816;The music shifts so suddenly sometimes that it can be jarring, but it's an effective technique.
I:9724;817;Jackie Brown is a fine addition to Tarantino's oeuvre.
I:9724;818;I can take excessive verbosity from Tarantino easier than I can from any other writer/director, because he's always fascinating, always moving, always trying to surprise, and always trying to tell a good story.
I:9724;819;Jackie Brown succeeds on all counts.
I:9724;820;"Among Tarantino's works, Jackie Brown lacks the propulsive speed of Pulp Fiction 
I:9724;821;The length of the setup, however, pays off beautifully when the caper itself.
I:9724;822;an actress of extreme sexiness and charisma.
I:9724;823;race across an airport to the tune of Across 110th Street, you know you are in for a cinematic treat.
I:9724;824;Grier was absolutely superb in this.
I:9724;825;It's also a delight to see Robert Forster, a tough.
I:9724;826;guy actor of the '70s, give a thoughtful and commanding performance as Grier's partner in crime.
I:9724;827;And the rogues' gallery of great character actors in supporting roles.
I:9724;828;Not only does it contain a great movie but the special features are some of the most in depth and informative I have ever seen.
I:9724;829;We all already know what a gifted writer/director QT is and I think that this is one of his best works (next to Pulp Fiction of course) and that it has quickly become a worthy cult classic.
I:9724;830;Excellent movie, keeps you guessing from beginning to end, the actors and actresses played their parts well.
I:9724;831;jackie brown is a good movie , but not as good as pulp fiction which was mostprobably the best in the last decade of twentieth century.
I:9724;832;I was underwhelmed by Reservoir Dogs, I thought Pulp Fiction one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and now Jackie Brown makes me realize that Tarantino may be the only contemporary commercially successful American director who can be compared to the 70s boy geniuses, Altman, Coppola, and Scorsese.
I:9724;833;These performances, with one very disappointing exception that I'll come to, offer ingenious rythym and detail and, most impressively, blend superbly, like a first rate musical ensemble.
I:9724;834;Their styles match into a whole greater than the parts.
I:9724;835;Samuel L. Jackson's bravura arias of show.
I:9724;836;off profanity are as specific and joyous as Fischer.
I:9724;837;Even Michael Keaton, an actor whose work has not really impressed me very much, is interesting here.
I:9724;838;a serious limitation given the roles he takes.)
I:9724;839;He's one of the handfull of reasons that it's still worth going to the movies.
I:9724;840;"Most of the violence that was in ""Pulp Fiction"" is gone, but there is much more story in this brilliant adaptation of a classic novel written by Elmore Leanord called ""Rum Punch""."
I:9724;841;one of Quentin Tarantino's usual actors, Samuel L. Jackson returns as the character Ordell.
I:9724;842;Jackie Brown tells the story of an illegal gunsalesman, Ordell and one of his best friends, Jackie.
I:9724;843;Jackie Brown features great preformances by especially Pam Grier, and, well, all the actors do extravagent work.
I:9724;844;The documentary Jackie Brown: How It Went Down is basically a vacuous cast.
I:9724;845;crew lovefest, but their enthusiasm is genuine, and the other bonus features are consistently worthwhile.
I:9724;846;minute interview with Quentin Tarantino seems excessive until you fully appreciate the writer.
I:9724;847;"director's passionate devotion to movies and movie knowledge
I:9724;848;cultural perspective, trailers for films starring Robert Forster and Pam Grier demonstrate the rigors of survival in Hollywood, making their Jackie Brown comebacks even more gratifying.
I:9724;849;At least one deleted scene is a classic, as Grier cracks up Michael Keaton with an improvised zinger.
I:9724;850;Digging deeper, there's a well.
I:9724;851;"rOM features allowing movie playback with informative text and trivia or side by side with the complete screenplay."""
I:9724;852;Based on Elmore Leonards novel Rum Punch , Quentin Tarantino's cool and classy adaptation is considered by many (in Europe, at least) to be his most mature (agree) and perhaps finest work (probably disagree).
I:9724;853;burn thriller, starring Pam Grier (as sexy stewardess Jackie Brown), a smuggler caught in the act by an ambitious cop (Michael Keaton), whilst working for gun.
I:9724;854;con Louis (Robert De Niro in a very understated performance) and other supporting turns by both Bridget Fonda as Ordell's perpetually stoned out bitchin' beach bunny girlfriend and Chris Rock in an impressive straight role and you have a very impressive ensemble cast.
I:9724;855;I really enjoy this movie.
I:9724;856;I think that what I liked most about it was the fact that the lead character, Jackie, decides to take a chance when push comes to shove.
I:9724;857;She recognizes that even though she's somewhat at the mercy of some very powerful men, including gun dealer Ordell and ATF agent Ray, she's smart enough to realize that they're both cocky and overly confident, and she can use this weakness to not only break away from both their control, but she can play them against each other and also get the money.
I:9724;858;Grier, Jackson, and Forster are perfectly cast, but perhaps the most understated performance comes from De Niro in a subtle yet complex role as a newly free criminal re.
I:9724;859;Like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and his recent Kill Bill films, Tarantino's Jackie Brown isn't for everyone, but the man's talent for storytelling and dialogue and the performances from the key players help make his third film a masterpiece on par with his other modern day classics.
I:9724;860;disc Special Edition of Jackie Brown doesn't feature a commentary by Tarantino, but it features a horde of featurettes and an hour long retrospective interview with the man himself that is worth the price of admission alone.
I:9724;861;I pray one day to meet the man behind this phenomenal projects to mentor me in my works.
I:9724;862;I am not a great fan of Pam Grier, but in this role and with Robert Foster she does a splendid job, Bridget Fonda and Samuel Jackson are great and poor Robert de Niro is left with a miserly role, that is hard to handle, still I loved the movie and watch it over and again every so often.
I:9724;863;This movie is very good I love Pam Grier and I've seen every film she has stared in.
I:9724;864;Sam Jackson plays a good role I think they killed Chris Tucker out of the film to early though.
I:9724;865;I know it comes from a talented directed but I was not aware that he was producing excellent work so early in his career.
I:9724;866;This movie has class,a great story and a happy ending.
I:9724;867;I am a huge QT fan and had never seen Jackie Brown.
I:9724;868;The movie is a hit!
I:9724;869;This is one fine movie, action packed and keeps your attention all the way to the end.
I:9724;870;Something funny happened to me today.
I:9724;871;Lots of action,nice twist at end.
I:9724;872;the movie flowed nicely with a lot of action and subplots.
I:9724;873;One of the most romantic movies I've ever seen.
I:9724;874;In between the great ships that pass in the night love story between The Great Pam Grier and The Great to See You Robert Forster is a good caper told in QT's stylish way.
I:9724;875;Underrated and worth owning to re.
I:9724;876;watch when you want to feel all warm and fuzzy.
I:9724;877;It's hard to match the genius of Pulp Fiction, but Tarantino does another excellent job and continues his reputation of violent cinema with a unique touch.
I:9724;878;One of the best actors in show business today, Samuel L. Jackson returns in a Tarantino project.
I:9724;879;Interesting and effective casting with Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda.
I:9724;880;Almost impressive as Grier's role was Robert Forster's acting job as the bail bondsman.
I:9724;881;level hustlers desire certain weapons is disturbing but true in a world that places Hollywood glamour above common sense.
I:9724;882;an ending that will keep you on the edge of your seat and a great conclusion with Jackie Brown singing 110th Street after the debacle she went through.
I:9724;883;Unrealistic, filled with violence but another creative Tarantino screenplay that doesn't disappoint.
I:9724;884;but so far this is the best.
I:9724;885;my photos came out do beautiful and clear
I:9724;886;It makes ironing a lot more fun.
I:9724;887;Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, one of my top five favorite movies.
I:9724;888;I thought the purpose of widescreen was to show the whole movie!
I:9724;889;The film was greatly anticipated, as it was Quentin Tarantino's follow.
I:9724;890;The film was an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch moving the location from Florida to California.
I:9724;891;The film is a good movie with some great performances.
I:9724;892;Much like he did with John Travolta, Mr. Tarantino pulled another great acting job from a forgotten 70's icon, Pam Grier.
I:9724;893;In the title role, Ms. Grier plays the character with the sass and grit that made her famous in the blaxplotation films she is famous for.
I:9724;894;Mr. Tarantino has fun with the film and overall it is a highly enjoyable movie.
I:9724;895;This is one of Tarantino's best homage films, a slow, gorgeous, seedy film, and Pam Grier is great as an aging anti.
I:9724;896;While the movie isn't hand in hand with the book it does keep the characters and the general plot.
I:9724;897;None of this actually takes away from the movie and it is still quite enjoyable.
I:9724;898;It's still a great movie even though it isn't until the second half until things really start to get rolling.
I:9724;899;All the actors are right on key with their roles and they play well off of each other.
I:9724;900;This is most certainly another Tarantino classic that any Tarantino must see.
I:9724;901;It shows Quentin's ability to step out a little bit and expand his talents and abilities so he can still kepp things fresh.
I:9724;902;I enjoyed this movie and I hope that you will to.
I:9724;903;You know, it's kind of too bad that Jackie Brown doesn't get much recongition amongst so. called Tarantino fans (being a fan, by the way, does not mean liking everything automatically), but it's a worthy candidate and still a Tarantino movie.
I:9724;904;Tarantino is able to make great movies no matter what, and this movie is another testament to why I love this guys movies.
I:9724;905;The reason you should watch movies is the entertainment value, that's what matters so much.
I:9724;906;Just to be sure, Jackie Brown is a bit restrained but still has the Tarantino trademarks that we all know and love.
I:9724;907;dIALOGUE 8/10Is this the best dialogue Tarantino has ever done?
I:9724;908;All of the dialogue is much better than usual, although, unlike Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, plenty of the dialogue kind of moves the plot around, it's merely there to be there.
I:9724;909;It makes everything a lot more human and a heck of a lot more fun to watch.
I:9724;910;"And this movie doesn't suffer from third person syndrome either
I:9724;911;The chicks with guns segment at the beginning, the funny bickering between Jackson's and Chris Tucker's characters, and Jackson and Deniro's discussion on Melanie, to name a few.
I:9724;912;Overall, this is great dialogue from Tarantino, and while not as good as some of his other movies, it still stands out with ease.
I:9724;913;I heard from a lot of people that the novel is great as well, but I have no experience with the novel.
I:9724;914;Her attitude is great, she has a liekable personality, and is up there with The Bride from Kill Bill.
I:9724;915;She forms a bond with Max Cherry, played by Robert Forrester, who is like her in many ways.
I:9724;916;The mutual undestanding between each other makes the movie have a good human element along with it's style, fun, and Tarantino trademarks with it.
I:9724;917;meanwhile, among the more fun characters include, well everybody else.
I:9724;918;Bridget Fonda plays probably one of the most memorable characters in the Tarantino catalog, a beach girl stoner who lounges around in shorts and a bikini top all day, taking hits from bongs and watching television.
I:9724;919;Chris Tucker's bickering is funny as heck, and the legendary Robert DeNiro plays a quiet, kind of shifty ex.
I:9724;920;It's another great set of Tarantino characters, and I'll be damned if they aren't memorable.
I:9724;921;pLOT 8/10I admit the characters make the plot more interesting, but this is still a plot that works very well on it's own.
I:9724;922;She sets up nearly everybody.
I:9724;923;It's not that complicated, and it's not as human or prominent as the characters, but it's still a pretty smart plot that is worth viewing again and again.
I:9724;924;He does so with great ease, coming from much of the bright, sunny crime ridde area of LA, the and especially his music soundtrack, which is one of his best.
I:9724;925;It's nifty and witty, and works very well, and well, makes the movie a __________ blaxplotation movie.
I:9724;926;After seeing the brilliant Pulp fiction I went and had a look at the trailer for Jackie Brwon , it looked good .
I:9724;927;The cast is quite nice though, Quentin always knows to pick the right people, they played their interesting characters well.
I:9724;928;The story was quite cool, but it jjust got to complicated.
I:9724;929;Jackie Brown turned out to be an excellent movie with a plot that moved along quick enough to keep our interest and slow enough so as to follow the plot line and character development.
I:9724;930;There is a lot of good acting in this movie.
I:9724;931;Samuel L. Jackson does his standard delivery that commands the screen, Robert DeNiro actually seems to deliver a rare, sub.
I:9724;932;par preformance, Pam Grier does very well in her title role and others help out effectively as well.
I:9724;933;See it for yourself and see if you agree.
I:9724;934;"The movie is worth watching as well for its' intricate plot development as wellI have a suggestion for viewing this movie
I:9724;935;"Her second film by Quentin Tarantino, the new Orson Welles, and I say that without sarcasm, is an Elmore Leonard vehicle, a tale of bail bondsmen and shifty grifters
I:9724;936;There's something so satisfying about recognizing the inside jokes.
I:9724;937;There's almost a comic book exaggeration about Tarantino's work that lends itself in script and film to the big screen.
I:9724;938;There are so many swaggering dudes having their way.
I:9724;939;Seeing all those actors performing with each other was a pleasure to see.
I:9724;940;In the case of Jackie Brown, the influence of the 70's musical touch creates a setting that compels us to maintain our focus, more so than with your run.
I:9724;941;The music hooks us from the opening credits and never stops.
I:9724;942;the acting in Jackie Brown is fantastic.
I:9724;943;Samuel Jackson stunned me with his powerful performance and Robert De Niro has mastered the bit of a dim.
I:9724;944;Together they dominate the screen with their plans to become successful gun dealers during the 80's.
I:9724;945;what Quentin Tarantino does better than any other director, is he assembles a cast of actors who are able to portray characters which force the audience to both love and hate them at the same time.
I:9724;946;perhaps the greatest aspect of Tarantino's movies is that of the dialogue.
I:9724;947;The characters give it to you hard and fast and you believe them.
I:9724;948;While Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies gained the most recognition, Jackie Brown is his sleeper masterpiece that puts them all to shame when it comes to the script.
I:9724;949;jackie Brown is one of those movies that you don't need to put together, or try to figure out what is going on.
I:9724;950;That is a step away from what we have come to associate Tarantino with, but it works perfectly with Jackie Brown.
I:9724;951;jackie Brown is a thrilling ride and certainly one that you will enjoy watching more than once.
I:9724;952;Doug Thomas, your writing style is as tight.
I:9724;953;thoughted bullsh*t takes the privileged spot of primary review.
I:9724;954;Congratulations, your mom says she's proud.
I:9724;955;draw on their personal experiences in an effort to create an authentic piece of work.
I:9724;956;black could create something so sonically deft and authentic.
I:9724;957;music and dialogue carry this movie and are the two ingredients that make it such a pleasure to take in.
I:9724;958;"moving,"" but people who say that don't realize that the pace is purposefully done slow so one can enjoy each characters' interactions."
I:9724;959;Sam Jackson's character, for as messed up as he is, is a piece of art.
I:9724;960;I watched it many years ago, and then again recently, still found it to be very exciting.
I:9724;961;I bought this for my son last year and he said that it is a really good movie!!
I:9724;962;Forster is great, Jackson is great, De Niro is De Niro, Fonda is less horrible than usual but Pam Grier is a cipher.
I:9724;963;But to be fair she sure can light a cigarette.
I:9724;964;This is a Great movie he directed.
I:9724;965;In Tarantino's usual form, this movie is full of unexpected twists and impeccable delivery of every line.
I:9724;966;The movie, Jackie Brown, is one that is filled with stars and lots of great acting and action.
I:9724;967;It is one of the better Tarantino films.
I:9724;968;Very surprised at DeNiro's character, but done so well.
I:9724;969;excellent experience movie was received timely and in perfect condition.
I:9724;970;This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:9724;971;I love Tarantino's style, which is powered as much by mood as by story line.
I:9724;972;I have viewed this film at least a dozen times now, and it has made me laugh and feel anxious with every single viewing.
I:9724;973;In this film, rather than violence for its own sake or a strangely parallel universe of plausible if impossible crime, you get really good characters in an unusual situation.
I:9724;974;there is Jackie, the seemingly normal woman at the center of the film who turns out to be as cool as a cumcumber and a superb manipulator.
I:9724;975;She is wonderfully subtle in her desperation, as much financial as middle aged and not wanting to start over again.
I:9724;976;mouthed bad guy, with hilarious dialogue, dim wits, and style.
I:9724;977;This mix offers a uniquely balanced chemistry of characters that are not in the slightest sterotypical, but quirky and entirely believable.
I:9724;978;the greatest thing that Tarantino did was to cast Grier and Forster, two has.
I:9724;979;beens who give remarkable performances even though they are not young anymore.
I:9724;980;They are so good that they eclipse the wonderful work of the others, which is also first rate.
I:9724;981;Again, they capture the mood of the time, and their age anxieties, extremely well.
I:9724;982;The drama is mature, not the usual bust.
I:9724;983;fInally, there is the wonderfully intricate plot.
I:9724;984;Here, the details really matter, and you can view the film many times to piece Jackie's entire plan together in its wonderful and very dangerous orchestration.
I:9724;985;While some reviewers say it feels too static, I found the tension subtle and far more convincing than anything else that Tarantno has done .
I:9724;986;this is by far my favorite Tarantino film and one of the best I have ever seen, a genuine master[iece.
I:9724;987;It is unlike any other film noir you will ever find, because of the fine work of Grier and Forester.
I:9724;988;You will not get a formula here, but a solid drama that is very scary and very funny.
I:9724;989;A couple of years ago, I started watching the series 'Justified'.
I:9724;990;I noticed the name of Elmore Leonard in the credits and was curious about his work.
I:9724;991;The plot is good but it is the outstanding characters and dialogue that will keep you enthralled through the movie.
I:9724;992;Love this movie and had accidentally given it away when I moved so I ordered it again!
I:9724;993;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9724;994;Watch Jackie Brown, Good Fellas, the Godfather trilogy (even 3), Casino and the Sopranos and drop out of school.
I:9724;995;it's so entertaining, smart, woman power, etc.
I:9724;996;She is smart and street saavy .
I:9724;997;Just love love love her.
I:9724;998;Don't even question, if you haven't seen it and you are in the mood for a great film, watch it now!
I:9724;999;I end up watching it every time!
I:9724;1000;Anyway, Jackie's plan was ingenious and she manages to screw up both the police and Ordell and takes all the money for herself in the end, with the help of Max who actually developed a fondness for her.
I:9724;1001;Like many Tarantino movies, there's a bit of love, lots of violence and swearing, and a twist in every plot.
I:9724;1002;This is a good one because the plan Jackie came up with was so clever and so risky.
I:9724;1003;At the end of the movie, I had to watch it again and the clever.
I:9724;1004;up from women everywhere who will say Thanks to Jackie Brown, who proved that older women can be attractive and smarter than everyone else.
I:9724;1005;Whatever you say about this movie, you have to admit, its really Tarantino's masterpiece.
I:9724;1006;I'm going to watch Kill Bill 2 next!
I:9724;1007;it was very entertaining with unforeseen and unexpected twists.
I:9724;1008;Lots of well known actors, but very unpredictable rolls.
I:9724;1009;Definitely a very unique film!
I:9724;1010;Jackie Brown is a fantastic film.
I:9724;1011;well Jackie Brown found a way to do it.
I:9724;1012;Featuring many of the qualities found in Tarantino's first two films, Jackie Brown includes a rock solid cast, witty dialogue, and a wonderful plot.
I:9724;1013;I chose this five star rating because of the plot, the direction, the actors' performances, Ms. Grier's screen presence and her beauty, the music, and the screen play.
I:9724;1014;one of the great movies, a great hidden love between pam as Jackie brown and Robert forster as max, I don't believe any man could not fall for Jackie and leave her get away to spain without him.
I:9724;1015;Jackie Brown has a pretty good plot and good acting.
I:9724;1016;I've watched it a few times over the years so it was worth re.
I:9724;1017;Great plot and characters, but Tarantino lingers too long on certain shots that go nowhere and do not move the plot or the characters forward.
I:9724;1018;Though not quite as good as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown is extremly entertaining and bloody hilarious.
I:9724;1019;It's a fun adventure that adds more depth each time you watch it, and you will want to watch this more than once.
I:9724;1020;De Niro and Fonda are infectious and funny)Plot: 4 stars (A fairly formulaic plot with just enough twists and acting prowess to be good)Production: 4 stars (Love the music and mall scenes, the film does sometimes show too much of Grier simply walkng around)
I:9724;1021;Tarantino does an outstanding job.
I:9724;1022;The characters in the movie are real, everyday people and when one looks beyond the actual content and actions of the film, everyday life is presented so well.
I:9724;1023;The film has a sad ending, but that is why it is so great.
I:9724;1024;A must see, but don't take it for face value.
I:9724;1025;"Adding DeNiro, Keaton (who's little acting ""ticks"", work perfect for his role), Forester (who received an Oscar Nomination for his superb supporting role), and Fonda (who's small amount of screentime is forgiven because she is absolutely HILARIOUS!)"
I:9724;1026;Even Chris Tucker's quick role is great.
I:9724;1027;This is a miss, despite the excellent cast.
I:9724;1028;if you want a film with a good story that's evenly paced and fun its really worth checking out this, picture is great on the Blu.
I:9724;1029;ray and there is plentiful features to watch!!!
I:9724;1030;They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime.
I:9724;1031;From the first lines of dialogue of this immensely entertaining 1997 caper, we are thrust back into the world of Quentin Tarantino.
I:9724;1032;The beauty of Tarantino's writing/directing style is evident in the above quote.
I:9724;1033;old but gorgeous stewardess stuck in a going.
I:9724;1034;based arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson, in a fitfully funny performance).
I:9724;1035;Watch this film and then watch it again.
I:9724;1036;tarantino, once again has assembled a cast that has more than delivered the goods in terms of their performances.
I:9724;1037;notably Samuel L. Jackson (Ordell), Pam Grier (title role) and superb Robert Forster (Max Cherry).
I:9724;1038;The story is good, direction.
I:9724;1039;outstanding and the overall pace of the movie is pitched just right.
I:9724;1040;Come on Quentin, make another movie!
I:9724;1041;It has been four years!
I:9724;1042;disc Special Edition is just great.
I:9724;1043;loved it action packed, and I loved all the actors that were in this movie too I will watch it again and again
I:9724;1044;I like the whole 70's tone of this movie.
I:9724;1045;It is fun, entertaining, and well acted.
I:9724;1046;"He delivers some priceless lines, perhaps most perceptive of which is: ""AK.47."
I:9724;1047;You will have gathered from this that there is a comedy element in this film and it combines nicely with Tarantinos trademark dialogue and action sequences.
I:9724;1048;Pam Grier is equally good as the flight attendent who gets caught smuggling gun money, and Robert DeNiro is a very laid back side.
I:9724;1049;piece in the middle of the film which you see from a number of characters perspectives.
I:9724;1050;No doubt he got the idea from somebodyelse, but hey nothing is entirely original these days.
I:9724;1051;this will keep you well entertained and the extras on disc 2 are pretty good.
I:9724;1052;I enjoy Quentin Tarantino's work a great deal.
I:9724;1053;I love all his films and each one gets better every time I watch it.
I:9724;1054;This is the one that I like the best.
I:9724;1055;I was so excited for Quentin's new film in the winter of 1997.
I:9724;1056;I went and saw an advanced screening and although the two friends I went with didn't care for it too much, I loved it.
I:9724;1057;It's well acted, directed and scripted.
I:9724;1058;elmore Leonard(one of the greatest contemporary crime fiction novelists).
I:9724;1059;When it comes down to it, I just love the romance between Pam Grier and Robert Forster.
I:9724;1060;It was just so rewarding to see them act together.
I:9724;1061;Another film that has romantic elements (also a good crime story) that is so much better than the standard romantic comedy/drama fare of today.
I:9724;1062;It is a film that for me, was the perfect direction for Tarantino to move in post .
I:9724;1063;i love both pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but I guess that ultimately the romantic in me wins out.
I:9724;1064;"Quentin Tarantino pays homage to the blackploitation era of the 70's in this film based on Elmore Leonard's novel, ""Rum Punch""."
I:9724;1065;That change actually enhances the movie, making it more authentic.
I:9724;1066;Pam Grier gives a Oscar worthy performance as the flight attendant hooked into a dangerous plot.
I:9724;1067;Robert Forester gives one of his best performances of his career as bail bondsman, Max Cherry.
I:9724;1068;But what makes this film shine is the music.
I:9724;1069;"Though a notch below Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" still delivers the goods!"
I:9724;1070;up to Quentin Tarantino's enormously successful 'Pulp Fiction'.
I:9724;1071;This film, a much more character driven piece, is probably his most realistic and linear of the five he's completed.
I:9724;1072;But the clever part of the movie has to do with it's shift from the initial plot to the lives and relationships of it's characters (all of which come off very naturally).
I:9724;1073;And because the pleasure of the movie lies in the relationships and dialogue of the characters (all of which is dynamic and plot.
I:9724;1074;The movie is very entertaining.
I:9724;1075;The heist plot is terrific but the 'hang.
I:9724;1076;out' scenes really make the film great, utilizing incredible dialogue and acting prowess (otherwise unseen from this group of actors and actresses, sans DeNiro) to tell a typical genre story in a much more subtle and personal way.
I:9724;1077;funny, sly, clever, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable.
I:9724;1078;great movie by a great director.
I:9724;1079;All star cast, great plot twists and a stellar old school soundtrack.
I:9724;1080;Jackie Brown is a riveting motion picture written and directed by the genuine Quentin Tarantino and adapted by the book Rum Punch by Elmore Leanord.
I:9724;1081;with clear influences of the 70's blaxpoitation flicks, in which Pam Grier is a veteran of, Tarantino treats us with a story of a washed up and mid.
I:9724;1082;the movie also features a funny special cameo appearance by Rush Hour's Chris Tucker.
I:9724;1083;The soundtrack alone makes this enjoyable, but Pam Greer makes it a super enjoyable movie experience!!
I:9724;1084;adapted from Elmore Leonard's book and given a Tarantino spice up,Jackie Brown in my opinion is him at his best especially with characters and dialogue.
I:9724;1085;but Jackie Brown is just as good and entertaining but in its own way,lots of characters,great dialogue,and just flat out cool style.
I:9724;1086;absolutely an entertaining,brilliant,and just all around rewarding expierience.
I:9724;1087;Plot, plot, plot, is really excellent in this great old movie.
I:9724;1088;"But the rest is pretty darned great, too, the actors/actresses, the acting, the camera work, well, everything that goes in to putting together a movie, it's all really really good
I:9724;1089;classic Tarantino/Jacksoncombined with DeNiro in an untraditional role.
I:9724;1090;simply great movie for all to see
I:9724;1091;So the extra stuff was a trasure.
I:9724;1092;I was happy to find this movie on Amazon videos because it fascinates me.
I:9724;1093;The rest of the cast is great too.
I:9724;1094;this was a good movie.
I:9724;1095;Samuel L. Jackson is great as a wannabe gangster who has to learn the hard way that crime doesn't pay.
I:9724;1096;But, considering the degree of ignorance within him that we all know exists, he comes through with an excellent final product in this case.
I:9724;1097;The entire cast delivers OSCAR worthy performances and one has to respect Tarantino for never making his film's predictable.
I:9724;1098;The man has genius flowing from every opening in his body.
I:9724;1099;The people who actually enjoyed the film see something you obviously don't.
I:9724;1100;which is fantastic by the way .
I:9724;1101;It works on so many levels .
I:9724;1102;"I love Tarantino's tradmarks
I:9724;1103;but, in my opinion, it's a five star movie and I wanted to share that.
I:9724;1104;nothing as good as new movies that go straight to blu.
I:9724;1105;movies like this you dont even have to look at.
I:9724;1106;If you are looking for adventure, violence, and mayhem, this is definitely it.
I:9724;1107;Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Tucker,Robert DeNiro, et al, gives powerful performances.
I:9724;1108;star cast (including Samuel L. Jackson, Pam Grier and Robert De Niro) and delivered the action.
I:9724;1109;It's the coolest because it's about a women getting justice without getting out the guns and it's also funny, Michael Keaton steals the show for me.
I:9724;1110;Strong female character well played by Pam Grier, Samuel Jackson showing more range than I've seen lately, Robert Forster striking just the right tone, Robert Deniro as a squirrelly just.
I:9724;1111;and for a classic with this many extras, any price is probably well worth it.
I:9724;1112;This waas an great movie it was great movie it showed a lot of action and adventure for the taking that is why I gave it a five star review.
I:9724;1113;This movie is great and it is so interesting and doesn't make you bored at all.
I:9724;1114;I have a friend that really wanted me to see it and one friend that said it was really boring.
I:9724;1115;disc version, you get a whole load of special features.
I:9724;1116;The movie and the story and the characters are really great and add a special feel from them.
I:9724;1117;I'll warn you that this has a lot of talking but if you listen and start getting to know the character, you'll love this movie so don't expect anything like Kill Bill Volume 1.
I:9724;1118;I love all of Quentin's work and I still do.
I:9724;1119;incredible actors with twists and turns.
I:9724;1120;Short movie review: Underrated, unpredictable, hilarious, great actors with great dialogue.
I:9724;1121;The soundtrack goes so well with every scene, the acting is seemingly flawless and the plot keeps you interested.
I:9724;1122;Oh, and Chris Tucker plays a small role and he is just as hilarious as he is in Friday.
I:9724;1123;Jackie Brown is one of those movies where you can't quite figure out what's going to happen next and then are pleasantly surprised when it does happen!
I:9724;1124;Follow her and the terrific cast through a Pulp Fiction.
I:9724;1125;The director's viewpoint is fabulous and keeps it interesting.
I:9724;1126;A few times in this movie I feel there is some extra camera time that could have been deleted, but otherwise a great movie!
I:9724;1127;The love story between Pam Grier and Robert Forster was bittersweet.
I:9724;1128;Samuel L Jackson stole the movie with his over the top Ordell Robbie.
I:9724;1129;This is the movie that proves Tarantino is the real thing.
I:9724;1130;Not as graphic and violent as his other movies, but has an incredible storyline that keeps you glued to the screen the whole time.
I:9724;1131;Aslo has great film techniques and intresting camera angles.
I:9724;1132;Amazon shipped the product in a timely manner.
I:9724;1133;Even after watching Tarantino's latest Kill Bill , I still believe Jackie Brown to be Tarantino's best work.
I:9724;1134;Maybe the charm is created due to the delicious music (which has the viewer .
I:9724;1135;falling in love with the Delfonics ) or the fast paced tale, moving between all these incredible characters.
I:9724;1136;"grier gives us one of the best women heroines to be seen on screen
I:9724;1137;This is no hot shot young lady full of herself and confident of her powers.
I:9724;1138;Not Tarantino's finest, by far, but Tarantino's worst can stand up to most screen writers and directors any day.
I:9724;1139;A good movie, but not his best.
I:9724;1140;"Furthermore, ""Jackie Brown"" may be Tarantino's most accomplished film in terms of visual storytelling and the performances are simply unforgettable."
I:9724;1141;jackie finds herself in jail, and Robbie posts her bond.
I:9724;1142;Robbie is so leery of his buddies that he brings in an old.
I:9724;1143;She'll bring in all his money at once when the cops aren't expecting it, and they'll pull a switch before the fuzz could figure it out.
I:9724;1144;"while there are no overlapping plots, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's best job of writing."
I:9724;1145;Tarantino's fans will appreciate the usual profane, inane dialogue that he writes so well, especially Robbie's instructions to Gara about how to unlock his car.
I:9724;1146;"written and directed by Tarantino, ""Jackie Brown"" is based on best."
I:9724;1147;"selling novelist Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch,"" published in 1992."
I:9724;1148;As Jackie Brown, busty Pam Grier is ideally cast.
I:9724;1149;the supporting cast is both diverse and fantastic.
I:9724;1150;Although Robert Forster has almost vanished from the screen, his performance as Max Cherry is so good and straightforward.
I:9724;1151;Meanwhile, Robert De Niro brings his customary thespian skill to his bank robber thug and delivers a fastidious performance that relies on his physical presence.
I:9724;1152;Lastly, Chris Tucker has only a few moments on screen, but he is infectiously funny in his brief appearance.
I:9724;1153;I love the new blu.
I:9724;1154;The movie is good too, one of my favorite Tarantino flicks.
I:9724;1155;This is sucha great movie.
I:9724;1156;to begin with, the combination of American and African.
I:9724;1157;american gangster pair still continues on from its predecessor.
I:9724;1158;The plot is pretty simple: A female flight attendant, working hand.
I:9724;1159;Within the execution of the plot, one is bombarded with the quintessential `Tarantino': great `dirty' dialogues, brilliant retro music, (instead of using background scores, Quentin uses songs) detached and controlled butcherly violence, and of course, the bohemian funny nature of the characters.
I:9724;1160;I say this because I was there on Christmas Day 1997, the day it opened.
I:9724;1161;I liked what I saw yet came away without that buzz from Pulp.
I:9724;1162;This movie is cinema gold.
I:9724;1163;If you enjoyed Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, you will most likely enjoy this flick as well.
I:9724;1164;Awesome soundtrack, great story and Robert Deniro playing a bong smoking convicted bank robber.
I:9724;1165;I love this movie, it's one of the best from the 90's!
I:9724;1166;A superb cast (Samuel Jackson, DeNiro, Bridget Fonda) anchored by Pam Grier as a surprisingly interesting and complexly played central character.
I:9724;1167;Great music drives the beat of this movie that is dark, funny, and poignant.
I:9724;1168;I loved Pulp Fiction but always felt it necessary to turn it down or off when my father came in the room.
I:9724;1169;What Pulp Fiction acheived with shock value Tarantino's Jackie Brown gets a bit more subtley.
I:9724;1170;Robert Foerester was my favoriete character but Jackson, De Niro, and Grier also act perfectly.
I:9724;1171;The last sequence of Jackie Brown shows the director's maturity and evolution as a film.
I:9724;1172;Subtexted to the entire yarn wuz how Jackie was somewhat a good looker who successfully sold her scheme(s) to the right men at the right time.
I:9724;1173;Every time more enjoyable than the one before.
I:9724;1174;But in light of the style of writing and pacing for the film, the great cast of exploitation actors and hollywood talent all shaken up into one package, it's really a hidden gem.
I:9724;1175;Some of my favorite actors (Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and the lead Pam Grier) are in the film and Robert Forster won an Oscar nomination for his role as bailbondsman Max Cherry.
