I:9802;1;It's a very touching movie that made me think about my passed away grandfather and compare myself with the son of the main character.
I:9802;2;It's a very good movie, with great actors, great acting and interesting plot.
I:9802;3;It's a good family movie and kids might learn something out of it.
I:9802;4;One thing for sure, you should watch it.
I:9802;5;Well acted, great story line!!
I:9802;6;It's a very vivid imaginative film with a great ending !
I:9802;7;Would re watch it and recommend it
I:9802;8;the son investigates the stories to discover his dad wasnt a compulsive liar but a person who enjoyed telling interesting stories.
I:9802;9;the giant from happy gilmore is in it.
I:9802;10;i think the kids will like it.
I:9802;11;it is about the 6th or 7thy best tim burton film,but that still ranks it far above most movies due to burtons dazzling brilliance in movie directing.
I:9802;12;its a film the whole family can enjoy.
I:9802;13;there are an emotional spot or two.
I:9802;14;there is this neat looking siamese twin chick,who sings for the troops,i think in either nam or korea.
I:9802;15;Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, and more other talent than I can remember.
I:9802;16;if you set out to write something that takes no risks whatsoever, you can write a Garfield comic strip.
I:9802;17;He takes risks, communicates his ideas, and makes you think.
I:9802;18;You must suspend more disbelief for him than any other director I can think of, but it's usually worth the effort.
I:9802;19;You'll enjoy this strange movie, and you'll think about it after it's over.
I:9802;20;It is a great family movie that we have always enjoyed.
I:9802;21;What follows is a journey which lover's of great stories must take.
I:9802;22;There are witches, haunted houses and trail's with living trees, giants, too.
I:9802;23;perfect towns in the center of a dismal swamp's with so much more to discover.
I:9802;24;There is love which literally stops time and commitments that are forever sealed.
I:9802;25;This is all just a taste of what you will experience.
I:9802;26;It is a wonderful story, that will survive through history as a classic, mark my words.
I:9802;27;It will remain as one of my favorites .
I:9802;28;I thought it was REALLY interesting and emotional.
I:9802;29;Very thought provoking and heavy.
I:9802;30;I cried my eyes out .
I:9802;31;Big Fish is a pretty fun movie.
I:9802;32;it's entertaining, and visually delightful, has Albert Finney in top form, and enough quirky characters to satisfy the eccentric viewer.
I:9802;33;but while I enjoyed the overall experience of watching Big Fish, I never really related to any of the characters, or felt emotionally moved, or involved by any of it.
I:9802;34;Ewan McGregor,overworks his Southern accent, and goes through the enitre film on one note.
I:9802;35;i also thought the ensemble cast had very little chemistry.
I:9802;36;i thought it moved along nicely, and kept me entertained.
I:9802;37;"be ""surreal"" tale with random psychedelic elements."
I:9802;38;It embodies much more than what it may seem at first glance.
I:9802;39;"and ""Ed Wood""), Tim Burton finally decided to explore two more realistic subjects: first
I:9802;40;"son relationship and second
I:9802;41;One can wonder how he managed with such a solid plot.
I:9802;42;"the beauty of the profound subject, the imaging, the style, and the meaning and purpose of ""Big Fish"", makes it a film to be remembered by many generations to follow."
I:9802;43;Tim Burton has delivered a masterpiece like never before: a landmark in US filmmaking.5/5 .
I:9802;44;"My children and we all thought the movie was ""way"" cool, but we are at a loss to explain why we think that."
I:9802;45;The stories within the story are interesting too.
I:9802;46;A gentle giant, a spooky wood, a war, a sort of Brigadoon concept of a town (well, sort of!)
I:9802;47;To me, this movie demonstrates the importance of being comfortable with yourself, and it shows that each person in this world can be significant.
I:9802;48;Not only that, but it does it in a way that is enjoyable to watch.
I:9802;49;I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
I:9802;50;In fact, I might just go watch it right now.
I:9802;51;"Tim Burton, one of the finest active directors, returns with another great movie, ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;52;We are witnesses of the fantastic and supernatural adventures that Edward (the main character) lived in his youth.
I:9802;53;the young Edward, played by the charismatic Ewan McGregor, goes through the funniest situations, he meets a lovable giant, he goes through an enchanted forest, he arrives to a wacky town where everybody threw their shoes to the electric wires, he works in a circus packed with freaks, he meets a poet that has written only three lines in the past 12 years, he goes to the war and he meets the love of his live.
I:9802;54;"the cast of ""Big Fish"" is excellent, it's a combination between veteran actors (Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny De Vito), remarkable actors (Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi), and young talent (Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup)."
I:9802;55;"the technical aspect in ""Big Fish"" is another highlight of the film, the locations are very colorful, the visual effects aren't as pretentious and overwhelming as in other movies, but they are simple, realistic and effective and get the job done."
I:9802;56;The makeup and the costumes are also excellent.
I:9802;57;Finally, the music is outstanding, it combines classic tunes with the original score, written by Danny Elfman.
I:9802;58;"Anyway, ""Big Fish"" has it all: fantasy, drama, comedy, adventures, sad moments, tender moments, unforgettable characters, interesting situations, an all."
I:9802;59;star cast, in few words this is a little gem.
I:9802;60;It was the most spectacular and touching film I have seen.
I:9802;61;Tim Burton really made something beautiful when he directed it.
I:9802;62;The film is so entertaining you just fall in love with all of the characters, and the end will leave you in tears.
I:9802;63;Ewan McGregor was enchanting in this film.
I:9802;64;I absolutely adored this film, and I hope that you all will go and see it's charm for yourself.
I:9802;65;Amazing story to make you tear up.
I:9802;66;One of my favorite Tim Burton films.
I:9802;67;The storyline was well written and brought out.
I:9802;68;every scene I wanted to know what will happen or just the scenes were just very interesting to me.
I:9802;69;I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job and Albert Finney.
I:9802;70;They protrayed their characters really well and made me part of their adventurous journey.
I:9802;71;If you like fantasy, humor, and something touching.
I:9802;72;to see if you REALLY enjoy it!
I:9802;73;And if you do love it.
I:9802;74;this film was never boring, told an excellent story, and the ending was fantastic.
I:9802;75;but it's worth seeing, i think.
I:9802;76;Strongly recommend watching this movie every few years and notice how the meaning changes with time.
I:9802;77;Loved this movie from day 1.
I:9802;78;One of my favorite movies ever.
I:9802;79;Big Fish is a classic movie in our family.
I:9802;80;It's a good balance of the comedic and the dramatic, and shows the evolution of a son's attitude toward his father's proclivity for exaggerated storytelling.
I:9802;81;The cinematography is simply beautiful.
I:9802;82;I loved this movie when I was younger and now I enjoy it with nephews.
I:9802;83;If you love stories its definitely a must watch.
I:9802;84;story in its own right, this is essentially an allegory depicting the complex, sometimes funny and often mysterious relationship between a father and his son.
I:9802;85;A look at Bloom and you instinctively know that there goes a happy fella, as if playing in his own `garden'.
I:9802;86;And it gives you a glimpse of how beautiful this world is, and how wonderful it is to be alive.
I:9802;87;"A sense of life that wants to grow
I:9802;88;The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.
I:9802;89;I have tried and I yet keep trying.
I:9802;90;But I have found my footing, eventually.
I:9802;91;In a sense, it was a very satisfying vindication of my unconscious dreams and beliefs.
I:9802;92;Yet, amazingly, it was a profoundly and refreshingly new experience.
I:9802;93;and that it continues to be every time I watch it.
I:9802;94;creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows, the result of which is often funny but also beautifully poignant.
I:9802;95;Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.
I:9802;96;"the main thrust of the script is how the initial ""Fish Stories"" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience."
I:9802;97;what a great movie it warmed my heart!!!
I:9802;98;It viewed just fine, I'm very happy, thanks.
I:9802;99;Tim Burton once again proves that if nothing else, he's capable of very odd and arresting visuals done at the service of his story.
I:9802;100;Some quite funny moments (my favorite is the North Korean ventriloquist) and just some really odd and unusual images, along with some endearing and likeable characters made this an entertaining film.
I:9802;101;Still, a film certainly worth watching (and yes, that really tall guy is pretty much really that tall.
I:9802;102;about 7 feet), especially for the humor and visuals.
I:9802;103;He has done this all his life, and seems to revel in being the center of attention.
I:9802;104;ed Bloom then starts to tell his various life stories to his sons wife.
I:9802;105;These stories are done in the tall tale fashion, Ed Bloom always seems to have the answer and always comes off as charasmatic and virtuous.
I:9802;106;Ewan MacGregor always seems to have a grin on his face.
I:9802;107;"this is a much mellower and more family based than some of his movies, ie the dark fairy tale ""Edward Scissorhands"" or insane BettleGuise."
I:9802;108;But the stories are usually upbeat and have a positive nature to them.
I:9802;109;He is a sports star, good looking, charasmatic, brave, earned his own way, and served in the war receiving honors returning to his wife after it was all over.
I:9802;110;the acting was good all around, and well cast.
I:9802;111;Ewan McGregor played his role excellently with the wide smile and thick sounthern accent.
I:9802;112;Helen Carter has two small but memorable roles and the girl who had a crush on Bloom and the witch.
I:9802;113;Making this a great movie for a broad audience, families, couples, or fanatics of Burton's cinematic vision.
I:9802;114;I enjoyed the movie very much.
I:9802;115;I've wanted to expand my movie collection and found this is a perfect addition.
I:9802;116;"There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'
I:9802;117;"Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest
I:9802;118;`Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.
I:9802;119;this is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.
I:9802;120;This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.
I:9802;121;When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.
I:9802;122;like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.
I:9802;123;The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.
I:9802;124;The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.
I:9802;125;This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.
I:9802;126;Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.
I:9802;127;the performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.
I:9802;128;Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.
I:9802;129;Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.
I:9802;130;I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.
I:9802;131;In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.
I:9802;132;Jessica Lange is marvelous and touching as Sandra, Ed's wife, and Billy Crudup manages to make Will believable and relatable.
I:9802;133;"Recent Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard does a fine job with what little she is given and makes a lasting impression
I:9802;134;the immense cast of `fantasy' characters are all brought to life vividly as well thanks to strong performances by everyone from Helena Bonham Carter to Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi.
I:9802;135;Alison Lohman does a fine job as the younger Sandra as well.
I:9802;136;in the end `Big Fish' is highly entertaining.
I:9802;137;It is a fantasy tale that the whole family can enjoy and it manages to teach a beautiful lesson about family relationships.
I:9802;138;A good film, but the key part of 'Big Fish' rests in your belief that young Ed Bloom (as portrayed by Ewan McGregor) can become old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney).
I:9802;139;By contrast, Alison Lohman becoming Jessica Lange was a lot more believable.
I:9802;140;old transition works at a fascinating level?
I:9802;141;And, equally impressive, we get two very famous actresses .
I:9802;142;playing young and old Iris Murdoch respectively to great effect and a semaless transition.
I:9802;143;I absolutely adore this movie.
I:9802;144;It is a fantastic tale, full of wonder and beauty, exquisite in detail and poignant.
I:9802;145;The dicotomy of the stark reality of the main character's plight, dying, and his ability to produce so much joy and life in his storytelling is, in short, inspirational.
I:9802;146;watching the interaction between him and his son, who has his two feet firmly buried in the ground is touching.
I:9802;147;The positioning of the wide eyed, open minded darling of a daughter in law between the two of them was excellent juxtaposition.
I:9802;148;fetched tales at the end brought tears to my eyes.
I:9802;149;it was a joy to watch, I have seen it several times and never tire of it.
I:9802;150;The sweetness in this tale gives hope that the beauty of imagination will continue to exist.
I:9802;151;seeing this movie warms my soul.
I:9802;152;This movie is for anyone with an imagination and a desire to explore!
I:9802;153;I loved this movie the first time I saw it and had to have it.
I:9802;154;its an amazing movie and its cheap and arrived on time and packaged good :) cant complain one bit, very satisfied.
I:9802;155;This was a funny, and touching movie.
I:9802;156;The actors were all casted very well.
I:9802;157;The ending to this movie was perfect.
I:9802;158;It is a forgotten gem by Tim Burton filled with bright colorful characters and a deeply moving story about a complex relationship between a son and his dying father.
I:9802;159;Entertaining and emotionally moving as on Tim Burton can be (think Edward Scissorhands).
I:9802;160;Big Fish is a wonderful film.
I:9802;161;Tim Burton's visual style is as amzing as usual.
I:9802;162;The colors he uses to set the scenes put right there beside the character.
I:9802;163;And what a wonderful story concept, a story about stories.
I:9802;164;The characters have personality and realism.
I:9802;165;Keep it up, Tim, because I'm aiming for you to increase the size of my favorites list!
I:9802;166;Also this is a Tim Burton masterpiece in production, visual effects, plot, music, and character interplay.
I:9802;167;The father and his younger version keep the viewer so entertained that you never want this film to end.
I:9802;168;I would recommend this film to everyone over the age of 12.
I:9802;169;This movie is one of my favorite tales.
I:9802;170;First of the visuals in this movie are astounding.
I:9802;171;The way in which it's told may seem odd but keeps the viewer engaged and the endign is pretty satisfying.
I:9802;172;This is undoubtedly the greatest movie I have ever watched in my life.
I:9802;173;Tim Burton is a genius.
I:9802;174;If you haven't seen this movie then you haven't seen the greatest movie you will see in your lifetime.
I:9802;175;I really loved this story since the first time I saw it.
I:9802;176;"Deliberately more understated than many Hollywood movies with such high ambitions, ""Big Fish"" offers a lot to cheer about, yet it still misses something."
I:9802;177;The film relates a story of Edward Bloom, an aged (and now dying) man, whose life, although rather ordinary, is enhanced by his wild imagination to a kaleidoscope of extraordinary, magic.
I:9802;178;Almost everyone is touched by those .
I:9802;179;"the trademark Tim Burton's direction (after ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"" we now have Ed Bloom) once again weaves the real with the magic, but especially the magic does not work fully (despite great work by the star."
I:9802;180;key acting of a decent caliber, yet the show.
I:9802;181;"all kudos, at least for being a family fun, which is rare these days
I:9802;182;an entertaining story with a refreshing twist.
I:9802;183;I've watched this movie probably 10 times and still love it!
I:9802;184;It hits all the right notes of bittersweet, funny, quirky.
I:9802;185;Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) is the perfect director for this film about a dying father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup), alienated by the father's habit of grabbing the limelight with his elaborate tall tales.
I:9802;186;The film uses elaborate folk stories about circuses, giants and warfare to address the relationship between fathers and sons, and is thus a film that will be entertaining for children even as it touches men in a more personal way.
I:9802;187;"Big fish is a movie that takes you on a visual journey on the lines of ""Wizard of Oz."
I:9802;188;It is the story of a Father who has told the Son a lot of tall tales his whole life.
I:9802;189;His whole life, in the son's eyes, has been one big fish tale.
I:9802;190;also we get to visit the little town of Specter,a town so friendly and laid back, that you must take your shoes off and throw them over the telephone line just to enter!There are many adventures,and though the special effects are wonderful, there is a deeper lying love story of mother.
I:9802;191;the story is visually stimulating, and part fairy tale, part truth.
I:9802;192;but it is thoughly enjoyable to watch.
I:9802;193;i highly recomend this movie to people of all ages.
I:9802;194;The macabe genius has slipped up here lately with his re.
I:9802;195;"make of ""Planet Of The Apes"", but the man is back and in a big way."
I:9802;196;Burton has always been able to take his audience on an incredible journey into the minds of oddball characters(Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) and into the presence of magical worlds and fairy tales.
I:9802;197;Never has he done so with such brilliance as he has with this latest offering.
I:9802;198;Will has always been hearing his father's wild tall tales, and has had enough.
I:9802;199;He is seen journeying through the world into haunted woods, enchanting towns, working in a traveling circus, and coming across people such as a giant, witches, werewolves, and other interesting characters.
I:9802;200;The story and screenplay is solid and laced with delicate writing, settings, and colorful characterizations.
I:9802;201;They did a fine job of getting the two actresses to play the same character.
I:9802;202;Crudup is a fine young actor and he does a solid job as the confused son searching for answers.
I:9802;203;Every frame is flawlessly choreographed, and the sets and art direction are magical, clear, colorful, and have a very serene feel.
I:9802;204;This is definitley Burton's masterpiece.
I:9802;205;It is a film that seems more human than anything he has done.
I:9802;206;Ewan brings an enthusiasm and down home charm to his role as the younger Edward, and he is enigmatic throughout.
I:9802;207;You are instantly charmed and even though you already know how he turns out, you root for him and wish him the best on his journey in life.
I:9802;208;Albert Finney does a fine job as the older, ailing Edward.
I:9802;209;He comes across as a very likeable old man who just embraces life.
I:9802;210;Live it to it's fullest.
I:9802;211;This is a dreamlike movie that will capture your imagination.
I:9802;212;Brings me to tears almost every time I watch it.
I:9802;213;I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, and this movie was no exception.
I:9802;214;It was touching and exciting, with just enough fantasy element to keep it light.
I:9802;215;Superb acting by the leads in the movie, and an amazing storyline, made this one of my favorites.
I:9802;216;I was skeptical and took some days to see it, but when I finally did it, I was wonderfully surprised, what a gem!
I:9802;217;Reality are the stories we decide to live by, and I pray to the Lord everyday that I can tell good and nice stories to me and those few beings who fortunately share their lives with me.
I:9802;218;"i have always thought that I was born in a wrong time and place, but I can still dream nice stories that give me meaning and warm, can you?As the Big Fish's son said, ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories""."
I:9802;219;make you a favor, enjoy it!
I:9802;220;It is magical, beautiful, powerful, and really makes you think about your place in the world and how you affect those around you.
I:9802;221;A must see movie for everyone!
I:9802;222;Tim Burtons best film yet.
I:9802;223;Inspiring message of wonder and imagination.
I:9802;224;Jessica Lange created a rich wonderful character that strongly supported the entire cast
I:9802;225;It's got a clever group of actors who make the most of the material that they're given.
I:9802;226;the main problem with the film, I guess, is that Burton himself is far more interested in the colorful world of Bloom's stories.
I:9802;227;Burton's never been very good at a connected, driven narrative, anyway.
I:9802;228;"because of that, Burton all but ignores making the ""real life"" bits as good as the stylized ""stories."""
I:9802;229;And the two elements never really come together.
I:9802;230;This is a very creative film.
I:9802;231;Can be a little strange at times, but overall is a great movie.
I:9802;232;This movie, by Tim Burton is by far one of his best.
I:9802;233;"I have enjoyed most of Tim Burton's movies in the past such as, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Scissorhands
I:9802;234;As the stories and the movie unfold, Will learns more about his father and himself, as well as the reasons for the stories that his father told.
I:9802;235;the movie goes back and forth between the present, and the stories being told as back.
I:9802;236;Each story is told with Tim Burton's usual sense of imagination, sensational imagery and darkness.
I:9802;237;The stories all revolve around events that happened in Edward Bloom's life, but each tale in the movie reflect a real tall tale.
I:9802;238;the actor's in this movie are all wonderful at the parts they portray.
I:9802;239;Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young, charismatic Edward Bloom.
I:9802;240;The contrast between the two actors as young and old is perfect.
I:9802;241;Jessica Lange as Will's mother and Alison Lohman as a young Sandra Bloom are also wonderful in this movie.
I:9802;242;The casting in this movie was amazing and adds a lot to the rest of the movie as a whole.
I:9802;243;That is made up for, however, in the great storyline and the colorful imagination and display of each story.
I:9802;244;I recommend this movie to be seen by everyone at least once and bring a box of Kleenex for the first time.
I:9802;245;Big Fish is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and genders.
I:9802;246;Since there is very little profanity and slight, but tasteful, nudity, this is a good family film and one that I even thought was appropriate to watch at a church youth group event.
I:9802;247;If you love Tim Burton's older movies, you will definitely love this one.
I:9802;248;I really enjoyed this movie, although being from Alabama the accents were definitely over done.
I:9802;249;The movie is entertaining from start to finish and was easy to watch.
I:9802;250;Tim Burton did a great job with this movie and made it a fun film to watch.
I:9802;251;Great movie about a man and his love of fishing.
I:9802;252;And about his happy death, goes to Happy Fishing.
I:9802;253;The acting is very nice and Ewan McGregor is great in his role as is Albert Finney and Danny Danny DeVito.
I:9802;254;The story is typical Burton with touches of magic and a great storyline.
I:9802;255;I love the costumes and music is great if sparse.
I:9802;256;This is truly a work of art in the finest sense.
I:9802;257;"It just seems like a lot of movies lately are lacking in some arena, whether it is story or dialogue or visual elements, and I have to say something like, ""It was a good movie, except."""
I:9802;258;Big Fish has an amazing story (always good when you find yourself thinking.
I:9802;259;wow, I wish I had written this), good dialogue, and, as is usually the case with Tim Burton, amazing visuals.
I:9802;260;The movie jumps back and forth between the past and the present.
I:9802;261;The past is told through Edward's stories, and they are absolutely beautiful visually.
I:9802;262;it just looks that perfect.
I:9802;263;The performances in the movie are generally very good, especially that of Albert Finney who has some superbly touching scenes with Jessica Lange.
I:9802;264;Not such a great gift I guess.
I:9802;265;This movie could've been very good, but it wasn't.
I:9802;266;While they were presented in a way that was so surreal and colorful, they were also very human and relatable.
I:9802;267;Above all this movie was steeped with integrity.
I:9802;268;It was as honorable, imaginative and lovely as fatherhood itself.
I:9802;269;I recommend this to anyone who has ever had a father or sons (or for that matter a mother or daughters.
I:9802;270;Mr. Burton really makes you look beneath the surface to find the truth in the message rather than the facts.
I:9802;271;Each one of the contemporary auteur's films has a distinctive visual style.
I:9802;272;In 'PeeWee's Great Adventure' huge bicycles roamed a wondrously colorful city.
I:9802;273;In 'Beetlejuice' it was the protagonist, as well as the striped snakes and the world of the dead, that dominated the screen with gushing energy.
I:9802;274;all of Tim Burton's films have an underlying creepiness to them, a little something that is both fascinating and disturbing.
I:9802;275;the performances are all decent.
I:9802;276;Certain elements are added to truth, and when his son (Billy Crudup .
I:9802;277;'Jesus' Son')shows up with his wife, he wants to hear the real story of his father's life, without the lies.
I:9802;278;fact is, they are not lies, they are enhanced events.
I:9802;279;perfect town, encounters the girl of his dreams, works in a circus, fights in the war.
I:9802;280;Then Burton annoyingly brings us back to the real world and reminds us it's just this man's rant.
I:9802;281;concious fierce freakiness of images, bringing to mind Edward in 'Edward Scissorhands' cutting his face with his metal fingers.
I:9802;282;albert Finney holds those bits together well.
I:9802;283;Ewan MacGregor is solid, if not resembling the 'older version' at all.
I:9802;284;Billy Crudup is always reliable, but is underused here in a slightly underwritten part.
I:9802;285;startling images and solid acting prevent 'Big Fish' from slipping into Hollywood schmaltz.
I:9802;286;This has become one of my all time favorite films, I have always wanted to be a bigger fish than I am, you should watch it !!!!
I:9802;287;Young William Bloom grows restless with his father Edward's tall tales of wild circus life, World War II heroics, and lost mystical hamlets rising up at the end of the lagoon.
I:9802;288;He floundered for years as a wierdo.
I:9802;289;Now, for the first time in Big Fish , Burton measures human emotion with his penchant for the quirky and the macabre.
I:9802;290;Big Fish stars a marvelous Ewan McGregor as the youthful Edward Bloom.
I:9802;291;McGregor delivers another enchanting, facile performance.
I:9802;292;Co. stars include Albert Finney and Billy Crudup.
I:9802;293;Big Fish is a mature fantasy surrounded by death's cold.
I:9802;294;And there's a sense of wonder here.
I:9802;295;As William Bloom says: The best I can do is tell it to you the way he told me.
I:9802;296;But that's what kind of story it is.
I:9802;297;Best movie ive ever seen!
I:9802;298;Has the most original script, great cast, great performances by that cast, and to top it off it was all done by the master, Tim Burton!
I:9802;299;I really enjoyed watching this movie.
I:9802;300;If you enjoy a great story tale of a movie then check this one out definitely!
I:9802;301;It successfully mixed fantasy with drama to great effect.
I:9802;302;Excellent book, builds the story well, and delivers with a punch that grabs you and then the tears flow.
I:9802;303;Between the cinematography, the story telling and the casting, this is by far one of the best movies ever made.
I:9802;304;Tim Burton is a visionary, Ewan McGregor is perfect as Edward Bloom.
I:9802;305;This is a great movie.
I:9802;306;It is about deciding to be exceptional, and taking the scary road.
I:9802;307;But if you do will anyone believe you.
I:9802;308;It does have a good plot.
I:9802;309;A heartwarming father/son story with very few over.
I:9802;310;top fantasy elements to get in the way.
I:9802;311;Great story and wonderful characters.
I:9802;312;Enough could never be said about how beautiful this movie is.
I:9802;313;then this movie will hit home and make you really appreciate the wonder and passion of a man with an inspiring imaginiation.
I:9802;314;A very well written, creative movie that is fun and touching!
I:9802;315;The best parts of the movie are the ones without Burton's playful imagery.
I:9802;316;Granted he can do some really good stuff in crayon, but step up and be a man for once.
I:9802;317;Big Fish is an excellent film, appropriate for all members of the family.
I:9802;318;The script well written teaches important values missing in so many movies today such as courage, loyalty, and family.
I:9802;319;How someone can write this well astounds me.
I:9802;320;I would have liked to see more character development with the mother, played by the lovely Jessica Lange.
I:9802;321;Just finally seeing this wonderful movie, and wondering how I overlooked it all these years.
I:9802;322;This has a lovely story, with meanings on several levels, humor, suspense, and an excellent cast.
I:9802;323;A suprise ending that made me absolutely yell out and shed tears of joy.
I:9802;324;This movie is absolutely delightful.
I:9802;325;I've always loved this movie and recommend for anyone who loves a good tall tale story.
I:9802;326;Very light hearted and will make you smile.
I:9802;327;I thought the actors were magnificent, the subtlety in the performances made the film powerful.
I:9802;328;Burton did a superb job on this film.
I:9802;329;It is a unique film, definitely a Burton film.
I:9802;330;The plot is great as well.
I:9802;331;It is quite a journey itself.
I:9802;332;It is really a story of a son coming to grips with the man who his father really was and found he was more than he ever imagined.
I:9802;333;If you keep this in mind as you watch the film, it offers an interesting contrast between the story.
I:9802;334;telling of an elderly Alabama businessman, Ed Bloom, and the storytelling of the film's director, Tim Burton.
I:9802;335;He takes the raw material of everyday life and enhances it, embellishes it, and pulls it together in an entertaining whole.
I:9802;336;Because his life had several odd twists and turns, he has more raw material for his stories than the average fellow.
I:9802;337;His courtship of his wife Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her youth and by Jessica Lange in her maturity, comprises the most romantic and the longest tale in the story.
I:9802;338;ed and Sandra have a son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, who has heard one tall tale too many and has become estranged from his father for the last 3 years while Will and his young wife live in Paris.
I:9802;339;The story moves from the vastly romantic courtship of Ed and Sandra to Will's stuggle with the relationship with his father.
I:9802;340;bed story telling Ed captivates Will's beautiful young French wife.
I:9802;341;At the end we see the son Will finally recognize that the tall tale, the embellished story, contains an essential truth that must be protected and clothed and escorted with the trapings of fantasy so as to be recognized, appreciated, and absorbed.
I:9802;342;this is the truth that Burton wishes for us to comprehend about the role of the storyteller and he relays this message in his own tall tale.
I:9802;343;as a final note, since I am from Alabama, I personnally enjoyed seeing the scenes that were filmed in old downtown Montgomery and on the Huntingdon College Campus.
I:9802;344;I saw the trailer for this film a few months back, and although I didn't know much about it, I was genuinely impressed.
I:9802;345;As Big Fish finally came out in theaters, I knew that I'd have to see it.
I:9802;346;I am so happy that I did.
I:9802;347;this beautiful film tells the story of a dying man (Albert Finney) whose son (Billy Crudup) feels as if everything the old man had told him about his life was phoney.
I:9802;348;The whole thing ties together in a beautiful way, and this movie you will be sure to love!
I:9802;349;It is a modern day Wizard of Oz!
I:9802;350;Big Fish is a great movie that anyone at any age can enjoy.
I:9802;351;It tells, in a series of flashbacks, the story of Edward Bloom's amazing life.
I:9802;352;I really enjoyed this movie, and so did every one else in my family.
I:9802;353;Filled with many funny and far fetched moments, Big Fish is a light hearted movie great for anyone.
I:9802;354;You will never regret watching this wonderful movie.
I:9802;355;He created in depth characters that you have to love because of how personal they are.
I:9802;356;Big Fish touches a sensitive side in most people.
I:9802;357;jock who becomes a highly successful traveling Southern salesman.
I:9802;358;"liked"" salesman who spins comic fish stories and Davy Crockett style tall tales about his days of athletic glory."
I:9802;359;Bloom, you might say is an accomplished fibber.
I:9802;360;edward Bloom is a classic American character, precisely the type of character that Hollywood movies have had a dearth of lately.
I:9802;361;Big Fish is a comedy masterpiece that you cannot afford to miss.
I:9802;362;An excellent movie that I will watch over and over again.
I:9802;363;The photography is superior and the ending is a surprise.
I:9802;364;I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, and the tall tale sequences made me chuckle more than I normally would while watching a movie.
I:9802;365;It is probably best not to try and seek deeper truths from this movie.
I:9802;366;nonetheless, it is quite entertaining, by and large.
I:9802;367;For this reviewer at least, a really good story about a bunch of really good stories is justification for liking it.
I:9802;368;So this movie has its moments.
I:9802;369;Very magical characters in a whimsical setting.
I:9802;370;yet everyone knows that they are just like me and you.
I:9802;371;Just an daft old man with a wild imagination.
I:9802;372;Big Fish is a fairy tale of a movie.
I:9802;373;BF is a really enjoyable movie.
I:9802;374;Great actors and a great plot.
I:9802;375;Will probably watch it again in a couple of more years.
I:9802;376;We both really enjoy the story.
I:9802;377;There are a lot of movies people say they love, or are great movies.
I:9802;378;But what makes a good film or movie?Big Fish has it all in pleasantly satisfying measure.
I:9802;379;This is not the greatest film of all time, but it might have been the best movie of its year.
I:9802;380;pressed to win an Oscar without being a blockbuster cash cow, Big Fish shone through as both a financial success (if not a blockbuster) and also a cinematic success.
I:9802;381;if you enjoy a good story, inspiring cinematography, lovable (if not believable) characters, and compelling moments, then you will like Big Fish.
I:9802;382;It was a pretty cool fantasy flick with a decent plot twist at the end.
I:9802;383;There are so many metaphors in this movie, that you can watch it time and time again and still catch more.
I:9802;384;The whole movie is a metaphor describing life as an adult and what you heard of as a child.
I:9802;385;this movie bascially is one big lesson in life.
I:9802;386;The past may not be what we remember, but it is how it is remembered that really is the key to living!
I:9802;387;I highly recommend this movie to anyone!!!
I:9802;388;Big Fish has to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
I:9802;389;It is well acted, looks beautiful, and is very heartwarming.
I:9802;390;the cast in the movie is just perfect.
I:9802;391;Everyone in the body embodies their roles and there are all perfect for the part.
I:9802;392;They all convey the right sincertity so that the story is believable.
I:9802;393;also, the movie is stunningly and artistically beautiful.
I:9802;394;It is full of vibrant colours that make the move a treat to watch.
I:9802;395;There are many scenes in the movie that are so beautiful that it nearly reduced me to tears.
I:9802;396;The scenes in Spector and at the circus are exceptionally impressive.
I:9802;397;The best scene in the whole film is when time stops in the circus tent.
I:9802;398;Everything except for Ewan McGregor is perfectly frozen makign for an artistic treat of a scene.
I:9802;399;finally, the movie just makes you feel good.
I:9802;400;It is about the true meaning of love and subscribes to the idea that people really do have a solemate.
I:9802;401;Edward Bloom is a great character and it is fun trying to figure out what parts of his story are real and what parts are not.
I:9802;402;Although the end of the movie is a little bizarre, it still leaves you feeling good because finally, everything fits.
I:9802;403;I simply loved this movie and I had to own it on Blu Ray.
I:9802;404;It will grind and stop and start again.
I:9802;405;For the price, I expected perfect!
I:9802;406;Big Fish is a terrific film that, once viewed, will leave you scratching your head as to why it was noticebly snubbed at the 2003 Academy awards.
I:9802;407;It's GREAT, inventive, and packs an emotional wallop.
I:9802;408;'By far, this film is Burton's best work yet.
I:9802;409;This is definitely a middle of the road Burton that can easily be watched by non.
I:9802;410;this really is a can't miss addition to one's collection, and I can highly recommend it to those who like films with emotional punch and stories that make you think.
I:9802;411;An added bonus, is that you will find you need to rewatch it several times to pick up subtle nuances the tall tales tell.
I:9802;412;With films like Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow under his belt, it seems that my favorite director, Tim Burton, can do no wrong when it comes to imaginative storytelling.
I:9802;413;I've always enjoyed weird, quirky films that are slightly off the beaten path and Big Fish is definitely one of those films.
I:9802;414;It is every bit a drama as it is a fantasy.
I:9802;415;He's a visionary and a dreamer and Big Fish is a charming, delightful journey not to be missed.
I:9802;416;You must discover this gem for yourself, not really knowing what to expect.
I:9802;417;This movie makes me all warm inside after I watch it.
I:9802;418;The scene where time stops and he meets Sandra is great.
I:9802;419;There are other nice scenes and it's a heart warming story of the relationship between a fahter and son.
I:9802;420;It is great for the entire family.
I:9802;421;I found this film to be very good.
I:9802;422;It had humor, great characters, and a mysteriously fun story.
I:9802;423;But it's a satisfying story that I could watch again and again.
I:9802;424;Big Fish was just brilliant.
I:9802;425;I loved every second of it.
I:9802;426;Ewen Mc Gregor is now one of my favorite actors, i find him extreamly underated.
I:9802;427;Steve Buschemi was so funny in this move.
I:9802;428;The movie made me laugh, cry, think.
I:9802;429;Big Fish was a great movie.
I:9802;430;Remembering our own grandpa's, it's easy to picture the dilemma of separating fact from fiction, as people tend to hyperbolize what they see as their own humdrum lives.
I:9802;431;I was able to detect scanlines in one of the modern scenes as well.
I:9802;432;If I could, I would give this version 2.5 stars for the attractive menu design and excellent audio.
I:9802;433;It's funny that despite films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands on his resume, Tim Burton is always known as director behind Batman and its sequel, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice, very dark gothic films.
I:9802;434;He's particularly known for telling wild stories to the point where they become just mere fairytale.
I:9802;435;His adventures find himself finding a colorful town, in the war, meeting the girl of his dreams from the moment he first saw her and being his own boss.
I:9802;436;He ends up meeting a wild assortment of characters including a really big giant, a Ron Jeremy look.
I:9802;437;it's quite a change from film like Sleepy Hollow but his trademark visual style is still here.
I:9802;438;wise is pretty straight across the board.
I:9802;439;Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney do great jobs as young and old Edward Bloom and always dependable and cutie Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange plays his love Sandra.
I:9802;440;The rest of them are kind of one.
I:9802;441;It's a book filled with artwork.
I:9802;442;if you're a big fan of Edward Scissorhands, you'll probably get into this one.
I:9802;443;For all others, give it a try.
I:9802;444;Simple Review: Reminds me of my dad and was a great movie to watch with the family.
I:9802;445;Just an overall great imaginative movie, a lost art of the imagination.
I:9802;446;Tim Burton's visually stunning but a bit too drawn out fable Big Fish was actually more deserving of 3 1/2 stars.
I:9802;447;Crudup and his wife played by French actress Marion Cotillard are treated to a plethora of these fables narrated by Finney.
I:9802;448;Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman give creditable performances as Ed Bloom's wife Sandra respectively older and younger.
I:9802;449;Along with that film's everyman.
I:9802;450;son dynamic of October Sky, and the rites of passage feel of Stand By Me.
I:9802;451;While it does not succeed as well as the aforementioned trio this is a good movie.
I:9802;452;Yet, dammit, with another director this could have been a great movie, certainly alot better than Burton's previous bests.
I:9802;453;Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying and his son, Will (Billy Crudup), wants to know the reality behind the stories that so charm everyone else.
I:9802;454;The last few days of Ed's life give way to flashbacks and fantasies.
I:9802;455;Later, he becomes a military spy and rescues a pair of gorgeous Chinese Siamese twins named Ping and Jing from the Red Army.
I:9802;456;Still, this is overall a good film.
I:9802;457;there is a wonderful sequence where young Ed 1st sees Sandra and time stops.
I:9802;458;This is a great sequence because it does simulate that feeling, but we've seen the time.
I:9802;459;What makes the scene a winner is that, to compensate for that momentary sensation, time has to speed up.
I:9802;460;this is truly unique, but.
I:9802;461;Still, the acting of Finney and McGregor is superb, as are the other supporting performances.
I:9802;462;One of those movies I can watch again and again.
I:9802;463;"This ""fish tale"" is generally a nice story about a father who tells tall tales for years to everyone and has a son who has resented those stories, thinking his father was nothing but hot air."
I:9802;464;The big pluses for this film were the colorful scenes and the fact that is was simply a nice story.
I:9802;465;the fun parts of the film are not the beginning or ending but the middle in which the dad's stories are brought to life.
I:9802;466;There are some strange and fun characters.
I:9802;467;son relationship, of course, which is meaningful.
I:9802;468;That may be a bit heavy but almost all the film is a lighthearted fantasy.
I:9802;469;It looks great on disc, too!
I:9802;470;While some find this movie strange, I found it quite touching.
I:9802;471;Yes, it is about fathers and sons and families and the way they hold things together with stories of various kinds.
I:9802;472;is it a great movie?
I:9802;473;The movie seems to think it is enough to wrestle a bit with the way lies, poetry and truth fit together.
I:9802;474;I did enjoy the poetry of it all and visually the movie is breathtaking.
I:9802;475;It is an amazingly truthful and achingly touching scene with barely a word being said about what is being communicated between them.
I:9802;476;It was wonderful to see Robert Guillaume again.
I:9802;477;He does a fine job as the family doctor and has an important scene teaching Will Bloom a bit about the difference between facts and truth.
I:9802;478;there are many other fine performances and I don't want to come across as being down on the movie.
I:9802;479;I liked it a lot.
I:9802;480;But by all means, see it.
I:9802;481;Take 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND''THE WIZARD OF OZ' and 'FORREST GUMP' stir it all up in a witches broth and your outcome is Tim Burtons magic potion masterpiece 'BIG FISH' Truly one of the most superb heart tugging and heart warming films ever made.
I:9802;482;I loved this movie so much I bought it again blu.
I:9802;483;If you can find it for a decent price, get it.
I:9802;484;I bought it for the Special Features, especially, the director's comments, watched it and love it!
I:9802;485;Not his usual dark themed movie, but a great,heartfelt story about relationships which is visually stunning as well.
I:9802;486;I highly recommend that you watch this with your children and loved one.
I:9802;487;Ewan McGregor is great as the sweet and somewhat innocent Ed Bloom, a saleman with a big imagination.
I:9802;488;He has a story for everything.
I:9802;489;This is one of the sweetest stories ever told.
I:9802;490;And the imagery is breathtaking.
I:9802;491;I have nver been so captivated by a film in my life.
I:9802;492;A must see for any film lover.
I:9802;493;This is realy a must see movie!
I:9802;494;It wasn't too violent, or mature themed and had a good storyline that kept us all interested.
I:9802;495;I recommend this movie for a good stay at home and make some popcorn kind of night.
I:9802;496;The story about the father/son relationship is a great one.
I:9802;497;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, doubly so because it was something I could share with my family.
I:9802;498;Big Fish has a good cast and some nice sets and once or twice it almost seemed to find its pace, but it never grabbed me, and that's unique among everything Burton has done.
I:9802;499;Big Fish is a film for everyone, from little children to grown adults for not only is it loud and colorful and very entertaining, but it touches upon the very fabric of human relations, and what better fabric to touch on but the bond between father and son.
I:9802;500;Albert Finney gives a brilliant performance, as does Ewan McGregor who plays Edward in flashbacks of his younger years.
I:9802;501;A sweet and endearing film, truly exrtaordinary!
I:9802;502;One of the best films, ever.
I:9802;503;true love and aspirations, and then life wants to stop them.
I:9802;504;This movie could have been as good as Forrest Gump, but it lacked a great screenplay.
I:9802;505;There are some great moments, but those moments don't come around often enough.
I:9802;506;While it has much of his style, it's more subtle.
I:9802;507;It has striking visuals, good actors (a fun small role with Steve Buscemi!)
I:9802;508;see it and shut up.
I:9802;509;But maybe Will has misread his dad, and all the stories are true in some sense.
I:9802;510;This good film could have been better if the visual medium had not overwhelmed the otherwise rich plot potential.
I:9802;511;His flights of fancy and flourishes of eccentric style make him one of the most divisive directors in cinema today.
I:9802;512;When the images and occurrences are larger than life, the film zips along with plenty of eye candy to sweeten one's taste buds.
I:9802;513;When the film lurches into the dramatic, the pace flags despite solid acting and a story that's a step or two away from touching.
I:9802;514;edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a man who loves to tell tall tales about his life experiences.
I:9802;515;His energetic delivery and unmitigated exuberance leave his audiences, disbelieving though they may be, uniformly rapt.
I:9802;516;The film traces Edward's life as a young man this way, featuring Ewan McGregor as the young wanderer.
I:9802;517;This is probably McGregor's best performance to date, because even though Moulin Rouge is a superior film, this role is more focused on acting and a pure emotional connection with the audience.
I:9802;518;McGregor succeeds on both counts, creating an extremely likeable and always fascinating character to observe.
I:9802;519;The impressive array of people he meets includes a giant named Karl, a one.
I:9802;520;life love Helena Bonham Carter), Japanese Siamese twins, a swarthy old.
I:9802;521;This portion of the film includes a haunted forest, a prophetic glass eye and more fantastical fun.
I:9802;522;Undoubtedly the strongest portion of the film, these flashbacks are both beautiful and energizing.
I:9802;523;big Fish is certainly worth seeing, and if the personal connection is there for you, it may work as well as it obviously hopes to.
I:9802;524;What it will leave you with is a feel.
I:9802;525;good feeling while you'll be searching for a clean hanky.
I:9802;526;tale like in its intense beauty of story telling and lush settings, while still keeping the draber side of the story (reality) enthralling.
I:9802;527;Even if they seemed to wild to believe, Edward manages to make them truly real.
I:9802;528;However children cannot stay young always, and finally Will grows up to despise his fathers storys, believing its the lies of a man who is has been discontent with his life and family.
I:9802;529;So begins the journey through the fantastic mind of one man who believed the world was designed to be lived to the fullest.
I:9802;530;He was the master of his destiny and death was just yet another adventure to be looked forward to.
I:9802;531;the end is the best part of the fairy tale, when Edward is dying and tells William to tell how he dies.
I:9802;532;Follow Will does, turning his fathers death into one of the most touching part of all the previous stories told.
I:9802;533;Not as colorful of fantastic, but just as wonderful.
I:9802;534;tim Burton strikes again, with yet another movie that will leave feeling as though life is truly as beautiful as portrayed here.
I:9802;535;Visually stunning, a wonderful score and soundtrack, coupled with a touching story and endearing characters.
I:9802;536;the movie is a dozen stories in one, with something for everybody.
I:9802;537;Action, adventure, comedy, romanance, whimsy, fantasy and wit .
I:9802;538;This movie allows each of us to let our imaginations run wild and let go of cynicsm and stress, if only for a few hours.
I:9802;539;Thought it does bring up other interesting points.
I:9802;540;Thought provoking, sad, joyful and worth watching more than once.
I:9802;541;Maybe I like the movie because I come from a family that values telling a good story.
I:9802;542;Sometimes the fun is seeing how far you can go with it before the listener catches on.
I:9802;543;I really enjoyed the movie.
I:9802;544;I especially like how at the end the son came up with a good story to tell his Dad.
I:9802;545;On its surface, it's a wonderful tale about tall tales, but underneath is the angst of a man who deeply wants to know his father.
I:9802;546;The end is a wonderful payoff for all that I will not spoil for you, but watch it.
I:9802;547;There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie.
I:9802;548;A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.
I:9802;549;Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.
I:9802;550;You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.
I:9802;551;But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.
I:9802;552;The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.
I:9802;553;I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.
I:9802;554;What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.
I:9802;555;i also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.
I:9802;556;It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.
I:9802;557;Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.
I:9802;558;ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.
I:9802;559;His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.
I:9802;560;tim Burton's directing is top notch.
I:9802;561;He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.
I:9802;562;He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.
I:9802;563;His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines.
I:9802;564;In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.
I:9802;565;It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.
I:9802;566;Watching a life unfold around us.
I:9802;567;bIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.
I:9802;568;Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.
I:9802;569;If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27.
I:9802;570;"I am a huge fan of the work of director Tim Burton and have found something to redeem even his lesser work(Yes, ""Mars Attacks!"")"
I:9802;571;Big Fish is his most assured and mature work to date, if mature refers to a movie that contains giants, witches, and werewolves.
I:9802;572;The acting in this film is superb.
I:9802;573;Ewan McGregor as Edward Bloom as a young man is every bit Finney's equal and he is another talent we take for granted.
I:9802;574;She is somebody to look out for in the future.
I:9802;575;Burton's direction is surehanded, the script is excellent, the art direction and cinematography is breathtaking.
I:9802;576;Another citation has to go to another one of Danny Elfman's masterful music scores.
I:9802;577;Will be the previusly released edition on it?or it's a whole new cut of the film?
I:9802;578;There is a chasm between my father and I that films don't help close.
I:9802;579;"And the when he saw the movie he said "" I liked it."
I:9802;580;I think it is one of my favorite Tim Burton films.
I:9802;581;and maybe in some ways, it is the one that got away.
I:9802;582;ewen McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Crudup, and host of others.
I:9802;583;it is an amazing cast.
I:9802;584;And the combination of sentimentality and stylization is perfect for Burton, who is one of our most sylistic directors.
I:9802;585;This is a unique, unsung gem.
I:9802;586;but it certainly is a story well told.
I:9802;587;I love the story, one day we will all be old and tell takes of our lives to our grandkids that will be our legacy.
I:9802;588;Yes they will be tall tales to relive the best times of our lives.
I:9802;589;This story epitomizes the melancholy and joy of sharing those moments near the tail end of our lives.
I:9802;590;i tell my son better stories than those in the movie.
I:9802;591;They got a 0 star rating.
I:9802;592;it would be a good movie to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon if there the best thing on TV was an old Tarzan movie.
I:9802;593;Big Fish is one of the most wonderful character studies I have ever witnessed.
I:9802;594;Albert Finney is marvelous as a story teller who's stories contain magic and wonder for his son, and always leave you wondering how much truth they contain.
I:9802;595;The true art of story telling seems to have disappeared in our fast.
I:9802;596;This incredible movie takes you back to the days when fathers held their child's interest by just relating his past.
I:9802;597;Only the most wonderful ending will let you know.
I:9802;598;It will make both of you laugh, wonder, and cry.
I:9802;599;I've loved it every since.
I:9802;600;A wonderfully told story with lots of well known and little known actors and actresses.
I:9802;601;Personally I think that Steve Buscemi's small parts make this movie over the top funny.
I:9802;602;this is a story of a man's tall tales coming to life as his son is telling them to his fiance.
I:9802;603;This film is funny, touching, and has lessons learned as well.
I:9802;604;Of course I own it and I highly recommend it.
I:9802;605;It is very seldom that trailer of the film tells the truth about it.
I:9802;606;This heartwarming and funny film brought to life by Tim Burtons inimitable imagination unravels a fabled relationship between a father and his son.
I:9802;607;sYNOPSIS: Edward Bloom (Oscar worthy performance by Albert Finney) has always been teller of tales about his unbelievable life as a young man (Ewan McGregor) when his lust for adventure led him from small town in Alabama, around the world and back again.
I:9802;608;Tales that range from the delightful to the delirious give life to giants, blizzards, a witch and so much more.
I:9802;609;life stories, Bloom charms everyone except for his estranged son Will (wonderfully played by Billy Crudup) who believes that these stories have kept him from knowing his real father.
I:9802;610;When his mother Sandra (ever so talented and beautiful Jessica Lange) tries to reunite them, Will must come to terms with his father and learn how to separate facts from fiction.
I:9802;611;It is visually stunning loaded with brilliant performances, amazing story told in an equally amazing way.
I:9802;612;And I guess one lesson I will always carry with is this: when telling a story you've got two choices .
I:9802;613;Anyone with an imagination will love it.
I:9802;614;"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is one of the more interesting movie going experiences I have had in some time."
I:9802;615;The movie is well casted and acted, with the pacing and direction perfect.
I:9802;616;What it does have is a lot of heart, and characters you will enjoy spending 2 hours with.
I:9802;617;His son has heard it all before and is upset because it is all make believe.
I:9802;618;but the stories are magical and captivating.
I:9802;619;"Every fisherman can tell a story about the ""big one"" that got away, hence the title of the movie."
I:9802;620;We suspected what we see, and we are happy with it.
I:9802;621;A Cult film, that is.
I:9802;622;telling that should be thoroughly enjoyed!
I:9802;623;"ma'am"" kind of life when you can add so much more to the story in the telling."
I:9802;624;Worth more than one viewing, so it's worth owning!
I:9802;625;then surely you will cherish this film.
I:9802;626;I loved it and will add it to my collection of all time favorites.
I:9802;627;This is one of those movies you want to just see to enjoy.
I:9802;628;Wonderful imagination here on several levels.
I:9802;629;Burton has done a good job of this.
I:9802;630;Be that as it may, I enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.
I:9802;631;Just watch it and have fun!
I:9802;632;the previews caught my eye as it seemed like a movie I would enjoy.
I:9802;633;i have watched it a couple of times and feel it will be a classic in time.
I:9802;634;the acting is good and the story is great.
I:9802;635;But hang in there, because this story has all kinds of life.
I:9802;636;Big Fish flows like a still stream in the beginning, and with the gradual intensity of the story development, the emotional ending was truly moving and impressive.
I:9802;637;will, the son of the self.
I:9802;638;Ed Bloom had loved telling tales impossible to take place to everyone, who fancied him for his humor and creativity.
I:9802;639;Most audience claimed that they were close to tears when they watch this part since the emotional outburst is unforgettable.
I:9802;640;ed's magical journeys take up the most part of the movie, and if not exciting, the scenes are truly picturesque and the depiction is sparklingly humane.
I:9802;641;His stories covered nearly every aspect of human life, and with his adventurous attitude he had prove himself to be extraordinary.
I:9802;642;Sometimes those stories drag on rather too long, yet there are some brilliant points of view from Ed.
I:9802;643;"Words like ""When one sees the love of his life, the time really stops as everyone says."
I:9802;644;Big Fish is thought provoking and there are many parts open to various interpretations.
I:9802;645;No matter what, we will feel better living in a world polished with beauty and brightness.
I:9802;646;I liked this movie very much.
I:9802;647;It was a lot of fun to see the father's stories on screen, and also watch his son's relationship with his father evolve.
I:9802;648;I'll be watching it again.
I:9802;649;One of my favorite movies.
I:9802;650;At times, the love story can get a little sappy and unrealistic, but that's the point of the movie so it totally works.
I:9802;651;I love to watch this as I'm falling asleep because its like a bed time story, the music is great, narration is great, acting/characters are great.
I:9802;652;great movie to get carried away with.
I:9802;653;One of the best films I've seen in a while.
I:9802;654;I love this film, and letting kids see it is great too I think.
I:9802;655;If you need a good two hours of beauty.
I:9802;656;this is the film for you.
I:9802;657;This movie is just a fun glimpse throught the life of a dieing man who loves to tell stories.
I:9802;658;It's a fun feel good movie with interesting story lines and a great ending bringing the stories all together.
I:9802;659;Big Fish is simple, yet complicated.
I:9802;660;while Tim Burton is an unforgettable director and Finney, McGregor, and the other actors are crisp, emotional actors, the film as a whole does not completely hold together.
I:9802;661;One of the most brilliant as well as funny movies i have seen in at least the last one year!I'm not a Tim Burton's fan but Big fish is one of my favourite movies of all times from now on.
I:9802;662;the story is great,the end is even better,the music is marvellous and the actors performances can not be put into words.
I:9802;663;I was lured into seeing this film after reading and hearing all of the great reviews that this film got and let me tell you, this movie deserves all of the great reviews that it gets.
I:9802;664;Edward and his son William have never really gotten along very well.
I:9802;665;this movie is just absolutely amazing but it's also a mix of tears and laughter as it's one of the most bittersweet movies that I've ever watched.
I:9802;666;Tim Burton who usually showcased his trademark with his generally macabre natured movies completely takes a U. turn and replaces the Halloween styles with a more southern classic atmosphere and he as a result breaks new ground in his career and it works almost perfectly.
I:9802;667;Burton on a directing note, hits another home run right out of the park on this movie as well.
I:9802;668;The story is just stellar and brings out incredible depth to the father/son dynamic.
I:9802;669;The movie plot is just fun and not to mention heartbreaking yet funny all at the same time.
I:9802;670;It will leave you happy yet wanting to cry at the same time.
I:9802;671;This movie is so much fun and so emotional that I literally did not want it to end.
I:9802;672;This film demonstrates the great potential of the cinematic arts.
I:9802;673;Brilliantly written, casted and acted, with a moderate, restrained use of special effects.
I:9802;674;I enjoy the grandiose retellings of events of the past.
I:9802;675;This combines Tim Burton's weirdness and mainstream storytelling beautifully.
I:9802;676;If you are a father or a son, I highly recommend Big Fish.
I:9802;677;This is the story of a son who finally learns to accept his father for who he really is.
I:9802;678;The story is told in an entertaining and whimisical manner (somewhat reminiscent of Forrest Gump).
I:9802;679;This movie takes that theme and tells a touching but not saccharin story a son reconciling his differences with his father when he finds out that his father has cancer.
I:9802;680;The cinematography and acting are both outstanding.
I:9802;681;there's more heart and soul in many of his films, namely EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and our topic of discussion today, BIG FISH, than in most other movies that I can think of.
I:9802;682;Each one brings a tear to my eye, each one is extremely beautiful, emotionally and visually, and each one tells a bittersweet truth about humanity, while enveloping us in a completely fantastical world at the same time.
I:9802;683;It's the story of a son, played by Billy Crudup, and a father, played by Albert Finney, whose life after his son's birth consists of nothing but telling the same blown.
I:9802;684;he spins yarns of 15' tall giants, witches, werewolves, tuna.
I:9802;685;the stories are shown in incredible, often visually stunning flashbacks, with the quixotic Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, and I was very satisfied to see that Tim Burton is still using predominantly non.
I:9802;686;or, if they were CGI, they were tangible and extremely well.
I:9802;687;hats off to Tim Burton, for this was one of the best of 2003, and without a doubt his best film since EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
I:9802;688;I love Burton films and am a big fan of most of the actors.
I:9802;689;tale world and I .
I:9802;690;Beautiful to look at, nice score, fine actors .
I:9802;691;Burton's best makes you feel as sad, happy, schmalzty as the best of them, but without your feeling so commercially manupulated.
I:9802;692;Big Fish is one of my favorite movies.
I:9802;693;"It has a little bit of everything
I:9802;694;It's a great movie for kids and adults.
I:9802;695;I thought Big Fish had alot of cute, whimsical scenes.
I:9802;696;I think this is a good film for families to see together because it balances itself between what is actually going on in the family, along with the history surrounding the past.
I:9802;697;This is a most rewarding movie.
I:9802;698;Tim Burton's BIG FISH is a dramatic, comedy.
I:9802;699;It's full of amazing visions (name a Tim Burton film that didn't).
I:9802;700;The film is funny, and sad, and moving.
I:9802;701;It's one of Tim Burton's rare gems, like SLEEPY HOLLOW or EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
I:9802;702;Make sure you don't miss this one, it's an amazing film!
I:9802;703;having read the book, I realize that screenwriter John August has incredible talent.
I:9802;704;August took Daniel Wallace's great story and elaborated it immensely.
I:9802;705;Amazing how such a great movie can come from the same writer as some of the Charlie's Angels movies.
I:9802;706;tim Burton does an amazing job directing.
I:9802;707;Both movies are amazing, and largely due to Tim Burton's directing.
I:9802;708;All come together to produce an amazing film.
I:9802;709;this is a must see.
I:9802;710;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:9802;711;Just have fun with it!The characters are amazing in this movie.
I:9802;712;Whether its the witch with the glass eye or Danny DeVito as the little circus man (he fits right in) or the Giant, the characters are larger than life and are very creative.
I:9802;713;It was both fun and emotional at the same time.
I:9802;714;This was an extremely well done movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.
I:9802;715;If you havent seen this yet, you are in for a treat!
I:9802;716;I'd seen the movie years ago and love it because it reminded me of my dad, who is now deceased, and all the tales he told us as children.
I:9802;717;It's a sweet love story with a bit of a surprise ending.
I:9802;718;I love the imagery and plot behind it.
I:9802;719;This movie always surprises you, and is extremely enjoyable.
I:9802;720;"Next to ""The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King"" it was one of the quickest movies that I have ever seen, and also one of the movies that I did not want to end."
I:9802;721;He then leaves the town that he grew up in, and while attending a circus he finds his true love.
I:9802;722;air, we see Edward meeting Young Sandra.
I:9802;723;For every month that Edward works for him, he will get one piece of infomation about Sandra.
I:9802;724;But my favorite story is the story about the famed poet Norther Winslow.
I:9802;725;It comes up so fast, and it's so hilarious because it's the last thing that you would expect happen.
I:9802;726;Winslow is played by Steve Buscemi, who is a brilliant actor who you see everywhere.
I:9802;727;"If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll love ""Big Fish."""
I:9802;728;It is a strange movie, but very realistic.
I:9802;729;It is hilarious at times, and then full of heart at others.
I:9802;730;Big Fish, was simply a great movie, and it is a movie that I have never seen anything like.
I:9802;731;Even the acting was brilliant.
I:9802;732;"I liked him in ""Moulin Rouge,"" I liked him in ""Down with Love,"" I liked him the last two Star Wars movies, and I liked him in ""Big Fish."""
I:9802;733;All of the other cast members were great but I do think that McGregor deserves an Oscar nod for this.
I:9802;734;"If ""Big Fish"" was nominated for an Oscar, I believe that it has a strong chance of winning."
I:9802;735;"I really hope this review makes it to amazon so I could stress the fact to people that ""Big Fish"" is one of the best movies of the year."
I:9802;736;big Fish is also one my top 25 list.
I:9802;737;This film has lots of memorable scenes and moments, visually and imaginatively.
I:9802;738;ewan McGregor (how the Scotsman pulled off the Alabama accent is amazing) and the talented cast do a great job, it's just that the story kind of fizzles out towards the last 30 minutes.
I:9802;739;I loved this movie, it takes you through a life span and makes you realize how precious and short our time is.
I:9802;740;Great message and it reminds me how important imagination is!
I:9802;741;with great acting and scenery.
I:9802;742;But he learns to understand the stories behind the stories and to accept his father for the generous raconteur that he is.
I:9802;743;_Big Fish_ has a lot to offer: humor, romance, whimsy, drama.
I:9802;744;tim Burton did a superb job directing the film, creating a nostalgic, almost other.
I:9802;745;The acting was spectacular as well.
I:9802;746;Ewan McGregor captured the young charasmatic Edward, and Albert Finney (although he spends the majority of time in a hospital bed) portrayed a very convincing older Edward.
I:9802;747;Billy Crudup gave a good performance as Will, Edward's son.
I:9802;748;Her younger self, played by Alison Lohman, received more screen time, and she proved herself to be a strong young actor with a bright future.
I:9802;749;Another note on the casting: there were many notable smaller roles played by well.
I:9802;750;Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito, and Helena Bonham Carter added great depth in their small, yet very important roles.
I:9802;751;the beauty of _Big Fish_ is how it portrays love and family relationships.
I:9802;752;The movie is beautiful, poignant, and heart.
I:9802;753;The Book is good, don't get me wrong, but I believe that Tim Burton did an amazing job bringing the book to life.
I:9802;754;The story was consistent the entire way through, no important parts missing that people who don't read books completely miss out on, and it's visually stunning.
I:9802;755;Watching the film felt like what my imagination would have created for the visuals while reading.
I:9802;756;I always recommend to people to read the book, it's better.
I:9802;757;"so I bought ""Big Fish"" the book when I heard they were making a movie about it."
I:9802;758;the movie, on the other hand, is much more intriguing.
I:9802;759;I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, but he did a great job of capturing the magic that I must have missed in the book.
I:9802;760;The acting is quite good .
I:9802;761;his diction was slurred and his mouth looks funny.
I:9802;762;Ewan McGregor is terrific, and Jessica Lange is, as someone already said, luminous but somehow wasted in this role.
I:9802;763;warming tale about family and learning to accept your loved ones.
I:9802;764;Lots of imagination and creativity.
I:9802;765;A great story with so much heart!
I:9802;766;I would (and do) recommend this movie to everyone.
I:9802;767;It really is my favorite movie!
I:9802;768;This is a great movie.
I:9802;769;I went to see the film with some friends this afternoon.
I:9802;770;Much to my surprise I loved the movie from the wonderful casting of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Helena Bonham Carter to the vibrant colors of the film.
I:9802;771;Tim does a wonderful job of melding the past and present together.
I:9802;772;I never thought that Helena Bonham Carter was remotely attractive but I have to admit that she looked beautiful as Jenny, a friend from Edward's past.
I:9802;773;She did look like Jessica Lange but younger.
I:9802;774;I loved Matthew McGory as the gentle giant Karl as well as the Chinese twins Ada and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing.
I:9802;775;Otherwise the rest of the ensemble cast in the movie put in outstanding performances.
I:9802;776;I also loved Steve Buscemi's character Norther Winslow and his transformation which I won't give away.
I:9802;777;"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;778;Just thought I would share that piece of information.
I:9802;779;She loved the movie and it was delivered right on time.
I:9802;780;She loves the movie and was happy it was packaged perfectly.
I:9802;781;Contentious relations aside, Will returns to hear the larger than life fish tales once more.
I:9802;782;The sadness of the story is bittersweet.
I:9802;783;otherworldly flashbacks brought to fantastical life by Tim Burton's unparalleled creative eye and the wide, bright, inviting smile of the ever engaging Ewan McGregor as a young Ed Bloom.
I:9802;784;He learns finally to love and respect his father, whatever his quirks.
I:9802;785;At once both whimsical and moving.
I:9802;786;bIG FISH is essentially two movies: one telling the story of Edward Bloom's life, and the other telling of his son coming to terms with his father as Edward's dying.
I:9802;787;"A lot more, actually
I:9802;788;oK, now on to the good.
I:9802;789;The rest of the cast does very well, too.
I:9802;790;As always in a Tim Burton movie, the production design is fantastic, and Danny Elfman's music was pretty good.
I:9802;791;But now for the best part of the movie, by far: the last five minutes or so.
I:9802;792;Then, I got quite emotional.
I:9802;793;It's these last minutes that make the rest of the movie worth watching.
I:9802;794;Just don't go in there expecting a Best Picture nominee, and you'll have a great time.
I:9802;795;Big FishThis movie, by Tim Burton is by far one of his best.
I:9802;796;"I have enjoyed most of Tim Burton's movies in the past such as, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Scissorhands
I:9802;797;As the stories and the movie unfold, Will learns more about his father and himself, as well as the reasons for the stories that his father told.
I:9802;798;the movie goes back and forth between the present, and the stories being told as back.
I:9802;799;Each story is told with Tim Burton's usual sense of imagination, sensational imagery and darkness.
I:9802;800;The stories all revolve around events that happened in Edward Bloom's life, but each tale in the movie reflect a real tall tale.
I:9802;801;the actor's in this movie are all wonderful at the parts they portray.
I:9802;802;Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young, charismatic Edward Bloom.
I:9802;803;The contrast between the two actors as young and old is perfect.
I:9802;804;Jessica Lange as Will's mother and Alison Lohman as a young Sandra Bloom are also wonderful in this movie.
I:9802;805;The casting in this movie was amazing and adds a lot to the rest of the movie as a whole.
I:9802;806;That is made up for, however, in the great storyline and the colorful imagination and display of each story.
I:9802;807;I recommend this movie to be seen by everyone at least once and bring a box of Kleenex for the first time.
I:9802;808;Big Fish is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and genders.
I:9802;809;Since there is very little profanity and slight, but tasteful, nudity, this is a good family film and one that I even thought was appropriate to watch at a church youth group event.
I:9802;810;If you love Tim Burton's older movies, you will definitely love this one.
I:9802;811;Every actor and character is perfect.
I:9802;812;Every visual is beautiful in its simplicity or complexity.
I:9802;813;It draws you in so gently you don't know it owns you until you're utterly disarmed.
I:9802;814;Thank you Tim Burton for this masterpiece.
I:9802;815;The film has a beautiful message.
I:9802;816;Its characters open up your imagination and encourage you to reflect on various aspects of your life.
I:9802;817;Its my favorite Tim Burton film!
I:9802;818;It not only has a fantastic cast, but a brilliant story.
I:9802;819;Its also a lot of fun.
I:9802;820;It captures the relationship between a father and son and how the son tries to decipher fact from fiction of his father's life.
I:9802;821;Ewan MacGrower was just fantastic and the rest of the cast delivered great performances.
I:9802;822;There a million reasons why I believe that this film was Tim Burton's (besides Beetlejuice) best film.
I:9802;823;His fantastic, often dark and macabre visions are combined with his knack for telling compelling stories that audiences relate to.
I:9802;824;In his adaptation of Dan Wallace's novel, Big Fish, he puts forth an unusually lighter film that is arguably his most personal.
I:9802;825;Edward continues to tell the fantastical story of his growing up, and the events that lead to him meeting is wife.
I:9802;826;Burton's visual aesthetic gives these stories a Southern Gothic flair that makes them each seem just a bit beyond reality.
I:9802;827;Each character is given a strong arch, allowing Burton's visual pyrotechnics to be matched by emotional revelations that are equally spectacular.
I:9802;828;The tall tales lend themselves to the fairy tale style that the film takes on.
I:9802;829;Overall, this is an exceptional adaptation of Wallace's novel, and a delightful film.
I:9802;830;I like Burton's stop animation work, creative.
I:9802;831;Oh yeh, the stories might be true in the end?
I:9802;832;Nothing interesting happens in this story, and the yarns aren't touching or comical.
I:9802;833;Being familiar with Tim Burton's darker side, this tale was a relaxing breath of fresh southern hospitality air.
I:9802;834;It was quite refreshing to watch a more heartwarming tale from Tim Burton as I generally regard him as an odd visionary.
I:9802;835;Another noteable difference of Big Fish was how the acting was consistently good among the entire cast.
I:9802;836;pleasing moments of visual tricks and friendly surprises.
I:9802;837;And the narrative of the story consistently held my interest up to the very end.
I:9802;838;"(POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) Without giving any details, I will say the ""tale"" given by the son at the film's end was a very nice touch."
I:9802;839;As the movie begins, we see a fantastic fish swimming in a fantastic body of water, as a man's voice tell's the tale of how he caught said fish, on the day of his son's birth.
I:9802;840;Imediately, I was excited to watch this film, since as a fouteen.year.
I:9802;841;People behind me keep talking, and yet the cinematography and enchanting imagination of this movie truly had me captivated.
I:9802;842;I mean, the whole movie is about Finney's character telling stories and it's connection to his life.
I:9802;843;While the acting was very good.
I:9802;844;It certainly didnt capture my heart enough for me to sit through it.
I:9802;845;This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
I:9802;846;"Tim Burton has really struck gold with his latest fim, ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;847;He made a film dramatic and epic, but still in the vain of his earlier works.
I:9802;848;"Everything about ""Big Fish"" is breathtaking."
I:9802;849;If you haven't seen it then you Must!
I:9802;850;Stunning visuals and a story that will make you want to be a kid again.
I:9802;851;This is the greatest movie I have ever seen.
I:9802;852;esque imagery and quirky characters that populate his films, Burton's films standout.
I:9802;853;Having said that, all the elements are here , a somewhat fantastical tall tale, great actors and beautiful scenes.
I:9802;854;And yet all these ingredients really didnt work for me.
I:9802;855;Towards the film's climax father and son come full circle and have an understanding of each other.
I:9802;856;the cast here are okay.
I:9802;857;Albert Finney does a fine job as does Danny Devito.
I:9802;858;I love Ewan McGregor who is usually fantastic at changing his accent.
I:9802;859;Still he is so likeable you cant help but forgive him.
I:9802;860;fantasy, odd characters, imagery, mystical settings.yet, in this instance, it does it with a Southern flavor.
I:9802;861;"The son, Will (Billy Crudup), has had to listen to his father's tall tales for years, and he believes that this has created a rift between he and his father for years, and that he doesn't know who his ""real"" father is behind all these fantastical tales."
I:9802;862;tim Burton's capacity to create symbolism, eccentric characters, colorful scenery and depth in this story help to make it an exceptional film.
I:9802;863;"what I also enjoyed about this film is that there wasn't just an emphasis on plot and imagery
I:9802;864;Some life lessons that the son must learn are to appreciate those close to you and to have faith in something that seems far.
I:9802;865;He learns that truth and fantasy are closer than he thinks.
I:9802;866;this is a unique film, with some beautiful scenery, exceptional casting, and interesting storytelling.
I:9802;867;the RC1 disc still is a nice release but anyone who wants the fullblown luxury should look for the South Korean release.
I:9802;868;Director Tim Burton brings his wonderful imagination into this lively, fantasy.
I:9802;869;The film is about the wonderful life of Edward Bloom, whose wonderous tales may be a little far.
I:9802;870;fetched, but enjoyable none the same.
I:9802;871;We also found out how he met his sweetheart, his exploits in a traveling circus, his successful business with a idealized southern town, and encountering a very big fish.
I:9802;872;The supporting cast is also great.
I:9802;873;Tim Burton knows how to get the actors' performances right, but also the fact he lets us view his vivid mind into making this complexed film.
I:9802;874;Big Fish is a sweet and filled with heart.
I:9802;875;Loved it, watch it over and over again.
I:9802;876;Big Fish is one of the best movies I have seen recently.
I:9802;877;This is a great drama/fantasy film that almost had me in tears more than once while I watched it.
I:9802;878;Ewan McGregor and the others did a fantastic in this film.
I:9802;879;It was good to see Steve Buscimi in the film as well, since I'm a fan of his.
I:9802;880;like always, the scenery and the places that the story took place in looked amazing, almost like a fairy tale world within the mind of Tim Burton.
I:9802;881;This fit in well for this story since the entire film is like watching a modern day fairy tale come to life.
I:9802;882;I was very surprised with how good this movie was, this has definitely become one of my favorite movies that I have seen recently.
I:9802;883;this film was a slice of life told in a very creative way.
I:9802;884;This movie is one of a kind, and has important things to say about life and love.
I:9802;885;Treat yourself to a very special movie as soon as you can.
I:9802;886;This is a must for many reasons.
I:9802;887;It's has one of the BEST endings of all
I:9802;888;Big Fish is a wonderful example of what can happen in film making, when imagination, ambition, and production values all come together in the correct ratios.
I:9802;889;It still retains his quirky signature, which works perfectly with the odd subject matter and story presentation.
I:9802;890;"With ""Big Fish"", he went outside his comfort zone, and created something more colorful and heartfelt than anything else in his impressive resume."
I:9802;891;Big Fish is ideal for anybody who relishes the use of imagination, and yearns for a good yarn.
I:9802;892;I suspect every father will empathize with Albert Finney, while on his deathbed, as he tries to connect with his son and overcome the latter's disbelief of his life's adventures.
I:9802;893;A magical and mythical movie whose ending is both sad and life and love reaffirming.
I:9802;894;This movie is a great mixture of emotion and production.
I:9802;895;But I hung in there and found it to be one that I hated and loved at the same time.
I:9802;896;it was stupid and clever, great and horrible, all wrapped up into one fantastic package.
I:9802;897;i cried at the end and came away with a very refreshing feeling.
I:9802;898;I took a liking to this movie a bit more extremely than the general public.
I:9802;899;I really thought this was a major contender with other great films of 2003/04 such as Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Mystic River.
I:9802;900;tim Burton is a pretty popular guy in the movie business.
I:9802;901;The actors all create interesting and meaningful characters that really exciten you as you follow the journey that they persue.
I:9802;902;Particularly found in the character of Edward Bloom, many/most of the characters are funny, interesting, and exciting.
I:9802;903;"It has a lot of traits that only independant films possess like the extremist story line and the outlandish characters and scenes, but it really does teach you a lesson and it does, more importantly, make a huge mark in your mind
I:9802;904;I love that about movies.
I:9802;905;while Big Fish is no Godfather, it is a must.
I:9802;906;"see movie of the year
I:9802;907;A movie that tells a story beautifully.
I:9802;908;The characters are rich and memorable.
I:9802;909;I love the way the story unfolds by being told along the way.
I:9802;910;`Big Fish' reminds you that sometimes you just have to see with the eyes of a child and to accept that their life is their tall tales.
I:9802;911;edward Bloom [Albert Finney] has a son and tells the most unique tale of how his son was born while he was capturing a 'Big Fish' problem is he's been telling this story for all the 30 something years his son has been alive and Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] is not enchanted with his fathers tall tales of life and love.
I:9802;912;"this film takes you on two journeys
I:9802;913;this film had the feel of a Superhero film sprinkled with real life and fables.
I:9802;914;There is a lot of fun in this movie and a great story of acceptance between father and son.
I:9802;915;Lots of big names and a great cast for Edward Bloom [Finney and McGregor] and Sandra Templeton [Lohman and Lang] not to mention all the supporting characters.
I:9802;916;It is an awesome feel good, family friendly, tear jerker!
I:9802;917;gothic style that he is famous for, I mean I love all his work, and its great to see him try new things.
I:9802;918;BIG FISH is still refreshing if not just a little strange.
I:9802;919;Nonetheless, it does not fail to entertain and it does keep you mildly captivated.
I:9802;920;there are depictions of outrageous to intimate slices of one man's life.
I:9802;921;Credibility and embellishment is an ethereal thing.
I:9802;922;depending on how much truth and perhaps the importance of truth itself is found in these events, there eventually there comes the pay.
I:9802;923;pI really respect and love Tim Burtons movies.
I:9802;924;Not only did he make great movies, but they are still great now and stand the test of time.
I:9802;925;unfortunatly because Tim is so great, people are going to exagerate and pretend that this film is a masterpiece.
I:9802;926;Much like the plot of the movie, they will create their own big fish and tell people that this is the greatest film in the world.
I:9802;927;As David Spade would say, I liked it the first time.
I:9802;928;As a lover of myth, folklore and fairytale I was absolutely enchanted by this movie.
I:9802;929;Daniel Wallace has created an endearing world within a son's imagination of the father he desires to know.
I:9802;930;The beauty of our minds and souls is how we can indeed fill in the negative spaces with dreams and tall tales that somehow do reality and truth justice within the reflection.
I:9802;931;I loved this movie for all it had to share.
I:9802;932;A lovely though temporary subtraction of oneself while staring at a two.
I:9802;933;dimensional pixel screen mechanically inhabited of recorded and projected images, and I recommend it to everyone.
I:9802;934;Story plot was definitely unique but it was one that touched my heart and brought a smile to my face :)
I:9802;935;BIG FISH is a sleeper of a movie.
I:9802;936;out fantasy gig, but for those who don't get lightheaded at the mention of this talented director's name of ilk of films, this journey has a lot of fine surprises.
I:9802;937;Burton wisely has a cast of professionals that help make this story work: Ewan McGregor is the young Ed Bloom and Albert Finney is the elder form of the man, Billy Crudup is the son Will, Jessica Lange the Mother (Alison Lohman is her younger self), and the assorted characters are spun by the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Robert Guillaume, and an especially fine Matthew McGrory as Karl the Giant.
I:9802;938;Endure the excesses of the first part of the film and the rewards are superb in the end!
I:9802;939;Tim Burton's distinct visual style is perfectly matched to the film's captivating blend of fantasy and reality.
I:9802;940;but what puts it above other films that engage your mind is that it works as a story as well.
I:9802;941;The best way to describe my experience is to say that it was like watching the Princess Bride for the first time (except now that I am older, the film is much more mature as well).
I:9802;942;I've enjoyed many of his movies in the past, but this is the first of his that I absolutely love.
I:9802;943;In this movie, a father has told fantastic stories all his life, much to the delight of everyone around him, except his son.
I:9802;944;As an adult, father and son are estranged, until the father is on his deathbed, and the son returns home hoping to understand what is the truth about his father.
I:9802;945;everyone seems to agree that the telling of these tales is a great feature of this movie.
I:9802;946;The special effects are done well, and the tales all seem magical, so much so that everyone is happier (or sadder) and everything is shinier in the version of events told by the father than in the 'real' world seen in the eyes of his son.
I:9802;947;These tales make this movie worth the price of admission alone.
I:9802;948;All of these people in the movie love the story teller, and love the stories, and they play with him.
I:9802;949;The son, wanting to know the truth, eventually realizes that it doesn't matter what the truth is, because he loves his father.
I:9802;950;In the end, he finds it easier to accept his father's tales for what they are, and does what he can to make his father's passing easier.
I:9802;951;the actors for this movie are well chosen, and particularly well done.
I:9802;952;Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman do particularly well as the young and old Sandra Bloom (and they look alike, as well).
I:9802;953;Ewan McGregor's constant smile works well with this character, and the sombre Helena Bonham Carter is right on.
I:9802;954;all in all, I think this movie is fantastic (in the old and modern senses of the word) and very well done.
I:9802;955;Great acting and vision brought to life.
I:9802;956;Tim Burton gets real with Big Fish.
I:9802;957;It's a great modern day fairy tale of sorts that everyone can enjoy.
I:9802;958;This is a tale about tale.
I:9802;959;Bravery, honesty, and connection will make you cry, especially in the closing segment reminding me of Lori McKenna's words in Paper Wings and Halo , if she could get out of that damn chair .
I:9802;960;His completely unaffected performance is one of the few charming things about this movie.
I:9802;961;"The giant says, ""No,"" and DeVito smiles and says ""Good!"""
I:9802;962;This gets a laugh from the audience.
I:9802;963;the deepening love of couples as they age.
I:9802;964;I suppose it's good for a few laughs and a quick cry .
I:9802;965;Tim Burton's most anticipated movie has finally arrived.
I:9802;966;But now, it's open nation wide and everyone can have a chance to see this movie.
I:9802;967;But is it worth the wait.
I:9802;968;"and the cost of your money?Albert Finney plays Ed Bloom
I:9802;969;after seeing this movie, I was just in awe at how incredible this film was.
I:9802;970;The movie is very emotional and definitely not for everyone.
I:9802;971;Through the visuals, one can see that Mr. Burton cares deeply for this movie and it's characters.
I:9802;972;The movie has excelled in it's breath taking appearance.
I:9802;973;Mr Finney is extraordinary as the father who is relentless in telling his stories.
I:9802;974;His performance of the son who can't stand his father or his stories is so human that you feel like you know this guy.
I:9802;975;The ending is so pleasing and glamourous that it makes the entire movie worthwhile.
I:9802;976;The ending is what truely turns this film from a good movie into a great movie.
I:9802;977;It's so charitable and memorable of the importance of a father/son relationship that it had me crying.
I:9802;978;Everything was tied together and I found myself cheering and clapping at how incredible this film was.
I:9802;979;big Fish is definielty worth the money.
I:9802;980;This is a film about a father and a son and the relationship between the two.
I:9802;981;This moving was very entertaining, with a great message!
I:9802;982;My boyfriend and I watched it on a Friday night and were both happy with the movie choice!
I:9802;983;"Big Fish is an exquisite film
I:9802;984;the acting was superb, the story heartwrenching, and the execution wonderful.
I:9802;985;this movie is, in my opinion, one of the best films of its year.
I:9802;986;"Big Fish even managed to refrain from making these messages appear trite
I:9802;987;this is an excellent, thought.
I:9802;988;provoking film which was a joy to watch.
I:9802;989;Its a big movie of its own sort.
I:9802;990;There are movies that I like and appreciate because they are well wound out as in the story relating is pretty solid.
I:9802;991;Go watch the film , lovers :)
I:9802;992;Big Fish is a wonderous masterpiece featuring a story tailor made for the imagination of Tim Burton.
I:9802;993;Big Fish is larger than life and features a tremendous performance by Ewan McGregor who just continues to raise his stock with every film.
I:9802;994;This discovery is made by staring deep into a witch's glass eye (one of the many tales woven through this film).
I:9802;995;Burton does a tremendous job of weaving in details that keep the viewer see.
I:9802;996;Big Fish is a visual experience to be enjoyed.
I:9802;997;A friend told me this movie was an English major's dream.
I:9802;998;I am pregnant, so watching an entire movie without a bathroom break means the film was riveting.
I:9802;999;This film proves, once again, Burton is a genius!
I:9802;1000;When the movie opened, and I saw Tim Burton's name flash on the screen, I thought, Uh, oh.
I:9802;1001;i understand that part of the charm of the movie was to be the intricate web of details and colorful language of the father's stories.
I:9802;1002;home, fanciful, and folksy character of the father.
I:9802;1003;Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor as the older and younger Edward Bloom are outstanding.
I:9802;1004;This is a wonderful and hauntingly beautiful movie on the meaning of truth as we sum up our lives and try to put meaning to it all.
I:9802;1005;This is an important work from director Tim Burton.
I:9802;1006;Who can deny about the originality and underground gaze of this filmmaker?
I:9802;1007;Burton is the true authentic storyteller whose imagination has overcome the standards.
I:9802;1008;From Beetlejuice through Batman I, The sleepy hallow to this trip plenty of visual elegance and arresting and captivating images all along the movie.
I:9802;1009;supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son.
I:9802;1010;The fish and the wedding ring is a special life lesson that will be revealed at the end.
I:9802;1011;But the kinetic camera and the ravishing journey behind the great love of his father, the impressive sequence with the huge yellow narcissus carpet will be the mute witness for the materialization of that expected love.
I:9802;1012;burton through this extraordinary metaphor, and visibly inspire by the magic realism .
I:9802;1013;the cast is impressive Finney steals the show as the dying father, Ewan Mc Gregor as himself in his youth and the fabulous Helena Bonham Carter shines in her secondary lines with her enigmatic beauty and supreme talent.
I:9802;1014;In this, his 11th major motion picture, Burton has deftly interspooled fantasy with reality as never before, creating a film that sparkles with mythological glamour.
I:9802;1015;Who was this man behind the inventive veil?
I:9802;1016;great poet whose creative reservoirs go dry all of a sudden, only to find his calling in the least likely of professions .
I:9802;1017;thanks to Edward, and so many others.
I:9802;1018;by the conclusion of the film, the viewer cannot help but come to the realization that although a lot of what Edward says is not completely true, a great deal of his farfetched stories are closer to the truth than one can ever know.
I:9802;1019;the bottom line is the people within his tales are indeed flesh and blood, and their lives were undoubtedly touched by Edward's selflessness.
I:9802;1020;Rather, its purpose lies in breathing imaginative vigor into those individuals he had the honor of befriending along his life journey.
I:9802;1021;Throughout his life, he meets giants, werewolves, an idyllic town by the name of Spectre, a witch, a pair of conjoined twins in China, and more importantly, the woman that he would later spend the rest of his life with.
I:9802;1022;One of the best scenes in this movie would be the scene where he met his future wife in the circus, and time came to a standstill.
I:9802;1023;Jessica Lange's small but crucial role helps us to believe the love Edward and his wife had for each other.
I:9802;1024;Yet, I was touched all the same.
I:9802;1025;a wonderful movie about a man who lived on through his tales, never ever getting caught even by death, making him the biggest fish of all.
I:9802;1026;Sorry about the cheesy clich d title, but I saw this movie after work tonight, and I absolutely loved it.
I:9802;1027;There'll be enough people giving away the story without me adding to it.
I:9802;1028;I'll just say that I was so impressed by the fact that the special effects were great, for my taste.
I:9802;1029;There is great subtlety and beauty in this movie, and the director kept this movie relatively clean.
I:9802;1030;Of course, for me, this is all gravy, due to the fact that there is actually meat to this movie in the form of a well.
I:9802;1031;written, if complex, story that's beautifully resolved at the end.
I:9802;1032;I love sentimentality, because I'm not afraid to cry, so this kind of movie is right up my alley.
I:9802;1033;what is it about members of the former British empire and their ability to do American Southern accents so well?
I:9802;1034;Speaking as a mere Oklahoman, today's crop of British actors do equally as well!
I:9802;1035;I think an Oscar needs to go to their voice coach, because he/she did an excellent job!
I:9802;1036;What he does is great comedic acting, and he was a joy to watch, as was Albert Finney, whom, frankly, I thought was dead!
I:9802;1037;The rest of the supporting cast was, well, eclectic, to say the least and fun to watch.
I:9802;1038;finally, let me say that they feature the most beautiful red Charger I've ever seen.
I:9802;1039;If you like the kind of movies I like, you'll love it, too.
I:9802;1040;This is my favorite Burton film.
I:9802;1041;I have a feeling that this is the style that he will continue with for years.
I:9802;1042;I loved the movie when I watched it in the theater many years ago.
I:9802;1043;A father and son separated by reality reunited by life as it really is.
I:9802;1044;Superb acting, and the story line is so imaginitive and well.
I:9802;1045;It takes you on an unexpected adventure.
I:9802;1046;I've been looking for a decent edition of this beautiful film.
I:9802;1047;This is the best i've found.
I:9802;1048;The best part about this movie is the son's re.
I:9802;1049;While in many respects, his father does not become the global hero that small town boy set out to become, he does become a successful man.
I:9802;1050;ish, living a real life and a fake life, one more incredible, greater than the man.
I:9802;1051;The movie starts with story.
I:9802;1052;The incredible stories are loved and accepted by all.
I:9802;1053;He returns to his father and attempts to wring truth from him.
I:9802;1054;will finds that bits and pieces of his father's tales are based on truth, although the final version involves some amazing fabrications.
I:9802;1055;his father had always been true to his wife, his love.
I:9802;1056;As he lies by his father's deathbed, his father's doctor comes along and tells him the real version of his birth.
I:9802;1057;Moreover, he realizes his father had been a good man, is a good man.
I:9802;1058;as his father recovers from the stroke that sends him to the hospital, Will gives his father his last triumph.
I:9802;1059;is happy and waiting for his arrival.
I:9802;1060;Will fabricates the tale so that he manages to carry his father all the way into the river, and then drops his father in its depth.
I:9802;1061;The glory of this film lies in the emotions it stirs within us.
I:9802;1062;The beauty of it is portrayed via brilliantly posed scenes, the clever mixing of characters from the tales with real life, and the precise usage of comic relief in the midst of what would have been a bit dry if utterly serious.
I:9802;1063;will's completion of his father's story marks an elegant ending, where he carries on the task of his father, a man capable of living without being overburdened by life, a man who knows how to embigger the life of others through his tales of sheer magnificence.
I:9802;1064;the aged memories blurred, accepting of new content in place of the real.
I:9802;1065;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:9802;1066;The acting performances are strong, the story well paced, and the imagery compelling.
I:9802;1067;You're never quite sure what to make of anything, and while some have viewed the ending as a 'surprise', I found it to be another riddle.
I:9802;1068;This is an entertaining movie that will generate some interesting discussions amongst your cinematic friends.
I:9802;1069;It was perfect as long as the son believed in the stories the father was telling him all the time, that is to say as long as Father Christmas really was a childhood hero.
I:9802;1070;The son and his wife came back and he was confronted to the stories again.
I:9802;1071;She sure was in love with the father but the father was faithful to his wife.
I:9802;1072;The son then discovers that all the stories were just embellished true stories.
I:9802;1073;And an epiphany takes place.
I:9802;1074;And when the funeral arrives, the son, his wife and his mother can only see with their own eyes that all the characters of these stories are true people.
I:9802;1075;But Tim Burton is a genius of the paranormal and how to make it look so natural that we are obliged to believe in it and to go back to our infancy, when we believed wonderful stories full of unbelievable wonders that we could only believe in deep in our hearts because they were so beautiful.
I:9802;1076;Tim Burton is a magician that mesmerizes us with surrealistic images.
I:9802;1077;I liked the story line it was cool to watch on a day where there's nothing to do but sit around.
I:9802;1078;One of the finest films I have ever seen.
I:9802;1079;Everyone I have shown it to has loved it.
I:9802;1080;A fantastic story about storytelling.
I:9802;1081;Burton's over the top innocence at it's finest.
I:9802;1082;Just a joy to watch this touching, and personal story.
I:9802;1083;Tears, and laughs in equal parts.
I:9802;1084;A onion for the ages, in my opinion a perfect recipe.
I:9802;1085;A man tells his stories often enough, he becomes his stories and his stories live on after him.
I:9802;1086;Big Fish is a story about storytelling, about embracing the magic of existence, and the art of telling tall tales, even if they are true.
I:9802;1087;This is a wonderful movie and it's life filled to overflowing with more life than life itself.
I:9802;1088;I loved every minute of it.
I:9802;1089;I watched this movie because it was Directed by Tim Burton, I had no idea what it was about, but I heard it was very good.
I:9802;1090;The first part of this movie was a fun heartwarming set of tall tales, intertwined with a son angry at his father for allways telling them and never letting him know the real truth.
I:9802;1091;I thought it was a good movie 4 out of 5 stars or so.
I:9802;1092;I wasn't ready for the movie to end, but I have to say this is the best ending I've ever seen in a movie.
I:9802;1093;The way in which the story brings the son around and shows us why and how his father's stories work is fantastic.
I:9802;1094;The movie was interesting, funny, and overall very moving.
I:9802;1095;It was incredibly fun to watch, had a great story and was very well acted.
I:9802;1096;Burton is just about the greatest director and he shows his stuff here.
I:9802;1097;I absolutely love this story.
I:9802;1098;Reminds me of my father and the wonderful tales he entertained us with growing up.
I:9802;1099;All families have their dysfunctions, but through it all, the love rings true!
I:9802;1100;Such a colorful life this man shared with his son and you can't help but admire the love he felt for his wife as well as all the people who were graced to share everyday with!
I:9802;1101;So nice to have a movie that you can share with friends and your children.
I:9802;1102;no violence or sex, just wonderful stories of everyday people who spin a unique mystic to everyday life!
I:9802;1103;This is one of the most beautiful films ever!
I:9802;1104;The plot is the perfect combination of fantasy, drama, and fun!
I:9802;1105;This is a very touching movie.
I:9802;1106;It is a little difficult to follow all the flashbacks but it made an interesting life even now amazing.
I:9802;1107;A great film I must say indeed.
I:9802;1108;Appreciation of cinema has led me back to once watch it again.
I:9802;1109;I Give this film 4 stars, but I do not have the desire to tell you anything about the story, it would't be the same, but I'll give you a hint.
I:9802;1110;Its a combination of a more believable Alice in Wonderland and Forest Gump in the most delightful way imaginable.
I:9802;1111;I hope you enjoy this film as I sure have.
I:9802;1112;Great movie and for all ages.
I:9802;1113;afterwards you really want to dive in a world of fairy tales and make you look at life with a bright light.
I:9802;1114;until the end the story line is well kept.
I:9802;1115;I'd recommend this to those that love a good story with a bit of tall tale fantasy in them.
I:9802;1116;It's a beautiful, colorful movie of tall tales told by a father to his angry son.
I:9802;1117;Watch it with your loved ones.
I:9802;1118;modernism is, go watch this movie.
I:9802;1119;Reality is rather formed by the stories that the father tells his son.
I:9802;1120;Excellent story and worthy of your time and money!
I:9802;1121;Was a nice movie including the theme of father.
I:9802;1122;It's entertaining, a little bizarre at times, but worth it.
I:9802;1123;Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and other great movies.
I:9802;1124;Was the movie full of lush visual effects like all Tim Burton movies.yes.
I:9802;1125;the one qualm I had with the film is its underutilization of its female characters.
I:9802;1126;Jessica Lange is certainly among the greatest living actresses, and Alison Lohman is a truly talented young performer.
I:9802;1127;, who actually delivers this time, her performance reminiscent of her former Woody Allen days.
I:9802;1128;still, the male leads were good.
I:9802;1129;I was surprised by Billy Crudup, and Ewan McGregor has certainly worked on his dialect since Velvet Goldmine and Down With Love.
I:9802;1130;And Albert Finney, a far cry from his Daddy Warbucks, is as wonderful as ever.
I:9802;1131;Big Fish was directed with such creativity and imagination.
I:9802;1132;Most Drectors if lucky wait their entire career to hit it big with their masterpiece, and Big Fish was Tim Burton's masterpiece.
I:9802;1133;why im i telling you this,because it is what i experienced.
I:9802;1134;it may take a day or two for your brain to process the movie into understanding it better, when that happens you will realize the magnitude and joy this movie brings.
I:9802;1135;you will really like this film which is basically an old man telling a young man huge lies about his life.
I:9802;1136;I feel the need to watch it every now and again.
I:9802;1137;On one of my all time great movies.
I:9802;1138;ewan mcgregor is a great actor.
I:9802;1139;Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Nightmare Before Christmas are great examples of that.
I:9802;1140;He's an expert at bringing fables to life and taking strange, exotic, and deeply flawed characters to the screen and presenting them in a way that allows a mass audience accept them.
I:9802;1141;In fact Tim Burton celebrates these characters, and that enthusiasm is fantastic.
I:9802;1142;Planet of the Apes is a great recent example of that type of film.
I:9802;1143;When Big Fish goes into fantasy mode the movie shines and is immensly enjoyable and interesting.
I:9802;1144;The characters in this world are wild and full of life.
I:9802;1145;To be honest, I believe it is a reflection of the filmmaker.
I:9802;1146;big Fish is a story worth visiting and Tim Burton fans will definately enjoy the fantasy portion of the film.
I:9802;1147;this movie will have you crying by the end of it.
I:9802;1148;This is one of those movies that I enjoy watching again and again.
I:9802;1149;Great movie, great story, great acting.
I:9802;1150;I've watched it a few times and every time I get something more from it.
I:9802;1151;This is one of my family's favorite movies and I was thrilled to see that it was available on blu.
I:9802;1152;"Now it takes a little thinking
I:9802;1153;It is originally a book, good sign, but it's also Tim Burton's portrayal that really makes this movie shine.
I:9802;1154;Coupled with Danny Elfman's score, and excellent performances by McGregor (I used to not like him because of Star Wars but now I love him) and Bonham.
I:9802;1155;"Most of the movie consists of the father's ""flashbacks,"" but unlike most movies who tried pulling this type of thing off, meshes it very nicely with the present day so that themes, contrasts, etc. can match nicely."
I:9802;1156;Course, I could just say that, but it is so much more effective in the unique, beautiful manner that Ewan McGregor's story tells it.
I:9802;1157;"Each of the ""tall tales"" that annoy(ed) the son (see, you have to watch the movie to find out if the son ever gets over it) tell a specific story or message, and through the exaggerations the points of these stories are seen more clearly."
I:9802;1158;so, watch this movie carefully.
I:9802;1159;Far from boring, it will captivate you, entertain you, and possibly make you think about your own life.
I:9802;1160;Children can see this one.
I:9802;1161;It is easy to say I love it because I really like this goofy movie.
I:9802;1162;The acting is excellent and Albert Finney is wonderful, as is the entire cast.
I:9802;1163;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:9802;1164;Simply a great movie for the entire family to enjoy.
I:9802;1165;A very fun fair tale movie and a great love story.
I:9802;1166;This is a surreal tale, combined with the reuniting of a father and a son.
I:9802;1167;Wonderful, but then again Tim Burton is a genius
I:9802;1168;It has an amazing story line but its worth watching for the cinamatography alone!
I:9802;1169;I was wonderfully impressed but how meaningful this movie is.
I:9802;1170;He beautifully shows how the son of a very imaginative man, doesn't not have a good relationship with his father because he doesn't believe his father's tales of his life.
I:9802;1171;Fantastic movie, one of the best I've seen in quite some time.
I:9802;1172;A wonderful release from reality, if you want to get away from the cold for a while and get caught up in a brilliant fantasy!
I:9802;1173;The visuals are stunning, the tales are amusing and heartfelt, and the characters are likable.
I:9802;1174;Definitely deserves some Oscar nods!
I:9802;1175;The story was a little odd, but I liked it.
I:9802;1176;It is a great film and it came in without a scratch.
I:9802;1177;allows you to use your imagination and keeps you entertained!
I:9802;1178;i loved all the characters, the actors played them well.
I:9802;1179;it was an amusing movie, great visual effects.
I:9802;1180;i took it over to my mother's house and she loved it as well.
I:9802;1181;i definatley recommend seeing it at least once.
I:9802;1182;I believe that every father should be able to tell stories to his children.
I:9802;1183;This movie is moving and tells a story that's as great as the story his father tells in it.
I:9802;1184;When I have children, I need to be able to tell them stories that will make their imaginations grow and flourish.
I:9802;1185;I believe it's important, and this film has inspired me to do just that.
I:9802;1186;I recommend it to everybody .
I:9802;1187;Critics loved it and so do I.
I:9802;1188;It takes you from the fantasies of childhood to the reality of adulthood.
I:9802;1189;The acting is great and the characters just make you think of youthful times when life seemed so magical.
I:9802;1190;How it all ties together make it a wonderful movie to see from time to time.
I:9802;1191;With so many other wonderful an in depth reviews on this movie I'll just admit im posting this one as a push for high marks and ill admit that.
I:9802;1192;the color scheme on this movie is top notch with the palette jumping out at you.
I:9802;1193;You dont often notice this with movies so that is definitely saying something here.
I:9802;1194;another great part of this movie is the number of quotes you'll find yourself carrying with you.
I:9802;1195;Devito puts up a show stealing performance and so do so many of the other actors.
I:9802;1196;this is one of my top 5 favorites and I think you should do yourself a favor and get this video.
I:9802;1197;the film was interesting and gave the necessary entertainment.
I:9802;1198;This is one of the best movies ever, and the whole family can watch it without worry.
I:9802;1199;One of the best cast gatherings ever and everyone fits their part perfectly.
I:9802;1200;i recieved this movie in a timely manner and it met or exceded all expectations.
I:9802;1201;It's touching, uplifting, funny, romantic and highly imaginative.
I:9802;1202;The performances are great as well.
I:9802;1203;Ewan McGregor is fantastic as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finny is equally great as old Edward Bloom.
I:9802;1204;It's all story and all heart.
I:9802;1205;Burton isn't George Lucas, he can make a good movie even without eye popping effects.
I:9802;1206;When it was over, I was thinking about the acting, direction and the story and about how good of a movie I just saw.
I:9802;1207;the result is a magical blending of truth, fiction, reality and fantasy.
I:9802;1208;Together with the actors, the viewer questions the boundary between fact and fiction and how important it really is to know the truth.
I:9802;1209;the father gives a moving performance.
I:9802;1210;seemingly outlandish at places, the pieces fall together in the end, providing a satisfying conclusion.
I:9802;1211;A good movie overall, especially for fathers.
I:9802;1212;A good movie with a message for everyone but don't really interestin.
I:9802;1213;In the end it turns out well.
I:9802;1214;The visuals and technique are great, as is the acting, but the story and expostion just don't work for us.
I:9802;1215;If ever there was a father/son story, this is it.
I:9802;1216;Through its magic and wonder it brings you smack back to your own relationship with either father or son.
I:9802;1217;Tim Burton and Daniel Wallace have given us a treat with this film, both visually and story.
I:9802;1218;Really enjoyed the story though about a father.
I:9802;1219;Overall, I enjoyed this movie.
I:9802;1220;i read the 'Big Fish' book during January and enojoyed it.
I:9802;1221;He has created a brilliant picture for Ewan.
I:9802;1222;From reports Ewan is very proud of this film.
I:9802;1223;'Big Fish' seems truely magical, lovely and nice.
I:9802;1224;So many wonderful, very beautiful lines.
I:9802;1225;The photography was so clear and sharp, one can watch the story unfold with ease.
I:9802;1226;I don't remember a car submerged in water, or even a car drying out in the branches of a tree, but the naked woman (mermaid) Ewan McGregor's character Edward Bloom sees in the water, I remember vividly.
I:9802;1227;It's all in the book briefly, as it is in the film.
I:9802;1228;i also liked Allison Lohman's role in this film even though it was somewhat brief it was effective.
I:9802;1229;She was the quintessential beauty of Edward's life.
I:9802;1230;I knew from the previews to this movie I would love it, but one of those reasons was her.
I:9802;1231;A very well cast film, filled with brilliant performances to bring a world to life.
I:9802;1232;Ewan goes about his role with sheer ease and style.
I:9802;1233;A genius at expressing his emotions.
I:9802;1234;He makes it look so easy.
I:9802;1235;I write that like I'm surprised.
I:9802;1236;Everybody loves Edward Bloom (like the flower).
I:9802;1237;whereever Edward turns his hand to, everything opens to full bloom in a warm glow of radiant sunshine.
I:9802;1238;It was an extraordinary moment.
I:9802;1239;I wonder how many other people propose to the ones they love, without knowing much about them.
I:9802;1240;In keeping with the book that Daniel Wallance dedicated to his own father, but made even better.
I:9802;1241;My love for this movie keeps growing.
I:9802;1242;I hope to see this movie again.
I:9802;1243;i really wanted to see this movie because I heard my special Ewan friend Gabrielle had a chance to be in it.
I:9802;1244;Lilia, one of the special girls able to meet and have a photo with Ewan McGregor, was one lucky girl!
I:9802;1245;I hope she enjoyed the movie too!
I:9802;1246;I'm so glad I got to chat and congratulate Lilia on her special time with Ewan.
I:9802;1247;You all make 'Big Fish' bigger and better then ever.
I:9802;1248;I shall hold this Ewan movie esspecially close to my heart because I loved it, but also for Gabrielle's sake too.
I:9802;1249;But until that time, it will be special to me because of Gabrielle.
I:9802;1250;A nice story with some surprises, this feel.
I:9802;1251;good entertainment is a son's recant of his father's tales that are not all just tales.
I:9802;1252;This is a good family movie.
I:9802;1253;There may be more than a kernel of truth in those tales.
I:9802;1254;He's a winning actor you can't help liking because of his smile and his openness.
I:9802;1255;the movie is part fantasy and part realism.
I:9802;1256;Along the way there are monsters, giants, man.
I:9802;1257;wolves, a witch, an enormous catfish, a phantom town, and other amazing sights.
I:9802;1258;the movie creates a pleasant mood, a fairy tale.
I:9802;1259;"It has an upbeat ending, and I don't know why exactly but the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump
I:9802;1260;This is a satisfying, pleasant movie.
I:9802;1261;Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll have fun with it.
I:9802;1262;"He sometimes goes further than necessary as in ""Alice in Wonderland,"" But this movie combines just enough fantasy with the everyday to make it a lighthearted experience."
I:9802;1263;Sunday, August 15, 2004 / 2 of 5 / Unappealing FinneyWhile I typically love Tim Burton's work, I found Big Fish to be oddly polarizing.
I:9802;1264;Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney `flounder' about in the present day incarnation.
I:9802;1265;Get ready to enter the wonderfully enchanted world of Tim Burton as he shows you anaything can happen in this world.
I:9802;1266;He sends a message that seeing is really believing.
I:9802;1267;The cast is great and will have you entertained throught the film.
I:9802;1268;The movie also sends a pretty positive message to children too.
I:9802;1269;If you like Tim Burton films then you will love this one.
I:9802;1270;This is the best movie he has made so far.
I:9802;1271;It was definitely one of the best movies of 2003.
I:9802;1272;Although the son loved his father's stories as a child, as an adult he felt that the stories were a barrier to a true and meaningful relationship between them.
I:9802;1273;and the adult son grows to cherish his father's spirit.
I:9802;1274;excellent movie, that invokes many emotions and thought about cherishing the friends and family in our lives, and excepting them for who they are.
I:9802;1275;It was fun to watch the story unfold, not really knowing where it was going to take you.
I:9802;1276;I personally love it which makes this a movie you want to own.
I:9802;1277;You'll pick up things each time you watch it.
I:9802;1278;"Great story, great message, but as I said it's a bit ""quirky""."
I:9802;1279;It's poignantly realistic about life and death, or at least to the degree that the director envisions.
I:9802;1280;In BIG FISH, Will must discover his father's essence by delving into the past, and the film's funky visuals are everything.
I:9802;1281;Go see it if you're easily bought off with cool visuals.
I:9802;1282;This is, without a doubt, my favorite of Tim Burton's work.
I:9802;1283;It has action, drama, romance, and humor.
I:9802;1284;It's an awesome movie for anyone with a colorful imagination.
I:9802;1285;I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to sit down, listen to stories and picture them in their heads.
I:9802;1286;Big Fish is a whimsically serious exploration of fact and myth, of father/son tensions.
I:9802;1287;Edward, the father, entertained his son William from childhood with an embellished tale about Edward's life.
I:9802;1288;as with all of Burton's films, image, mood, atmosphere and flights of fancy weigh far more importantly than honest human connection or cohesive narrative.
I:9802;1289;This is a film that demands we empathize with every step our protagonists make on their personal odysseys.
I:9802;1290;And that is a trick the self.
I:9802;1291;consciously eccentric Burton has yet to consistently master.
I:9802;1292;fortunately Burton allows his excellent cast.
I:9802;1293;even though Big Fish sometimes loses us along the way, it does lead us to the light of day in a most satisfying denouement.
I:9802;1294;big Fish isn't perfect, but if one shares a background as I do with young Bloom and his father, it will deliver fine, emotional entertainment.
I:9802;1295;Big Fish is a wonderful film that quietly makes a great point.
I:9802;1296;sometimes you just must accept your loved ones the way they are and not the way you wish them to be.
I:9802;1297;Amazingly once you allow yourself to accept them warts and all, they become all the more human.
I:9802;1298;this film is wonderfully done, and Tim Burton (as director) is at his most restrained and sure handed.
I:9802;1299;Yet Burton manages never hitting you over the head with the fantasy element and keeps the story grounded in life, even when soaring in imagination.
I:9802;1300;burton urges effective and wonderful performances out of all of his actors.
I:9802;1301;Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the optimistic, cocksure, and innocently trusting young Edward Bloom.
I:9802;1302;"Their relationship and love resonates very true and offers a clarity that their ""troubled"" son, who has lost patience with his father's tales, simply cannot grasp."
I:9802;1303;The pleasure of the film is watching him slowly come to understand his father's true legacy, as we see the real impact of his youthful tales come to fruition.
I:9802;1304;though not aimed at children, nor appropriate for the youngest, this film does stand as a fine story about the conflict of father and son, the depth of true love, and the search for what is truly a man's legacy.
I:9802;1305;In the end, Big Fish leaves you with a smile and the satisfaction of knowing that the time watching this film was indeed time well spent.
I:9802;1306;decent coming of age movie for the audience of the twenties.
I:9802;1307;the salvation of the movie comes from the imagination of the stories Bloom tells and Burton's visual sensibility.
I:9802;1308;This is Burton's best movie in years.
I:9802;1309;engaging Ewan McGregor get into one unbelievable adventure after another, we can't help but be amused.
I:9802;1310;just a whole lot of middle.
I:9802;1311;once again, it's not quite Edward Scissorhands, but it deserves much more attention than it got when it was originally in theaters.
I:9802;1312;This movie is really inspiring and makes you realize that your life will only be as interesting and fulfilling as you want to.
I:9802;1313;It is definitely a movie that you have to watch at least once in your life time.
I:9802;1314;It's a very interesting well thought out movie.
I:9802;1315;Big Fish is a creative film.
I:9802;1316;If anything it is fairy tale for adults, a romp in a decadent imagination.
I:9802;1317;In that sense it was fun.
I:9802;1318;I have to say I really enjoyed Big Fish.
I:9802;1319;And I don't normally enjoy movies that make me cry!
I:9802;1320;There were some parts I didn't quite like, but overall I thought it was a great movie .
I:9802;1321;one of Tim Burton's better movies (way better than Planet of the Apes, by far!)
I:9802;1322;He's always got a tall tale to tell.
I:9802;1323;He's loved his adventurous life and tells everyone about it whenever he can.
I:9802;1324;This has driven his son, William (Billy Crudup) crazy over the years.
I:9802;1325;The movie takes place during the time when Edward is dying and William has to come to terms with it.
I:9802;1326;The flashbacks and stories of Edward's life are so intruging and beautifully filmed.
I:9802;1327;Again, the fantasy scenes of this movie are incredibly moving and visually stunning.
I:9802;1328;the acting was phenominal as well in this movie .
I:9802;1329;I especially enjoyed Ewan McGregor as the adventurous young Edward.
I:9802;1330;He was completely believeable and created such a fun and interesting character to watch on screen.
I:9802;1331;Albert Finney was also wonderful as the older Edward, spinning tall tales to anyone who would listen.
I:9802;1332;Several supporting actors/actresses did a great job as well, especially Jessica Lange as older Edward's wife, Danny DeVito as the eccentric carnival owner, Helena Bonham.
I:9802;1333;I have relatives who spin tall tales all the time and I find it charming and fun.
I:9802;1334;other than that, I thought the movie was wonderful.
I:9802;1335;I still highly recommend seeing it, it's just a beautiful fun story, despite being a bit of a tear.
I:9802;1336;The acting is superb, the music is great, the sets and cinematography are wonderful.
I:9802;1337;It's a great film, one of the best I've seen this year.
I:9802;1338;"I saw Big Fish in the theaters 3 times
I:9802;1339;A couple people I know didn't really care for it, and some liked it, so liking this movie means having a certain aesthetic taste, but regardless, Big Fish can really be appreciated for its incredible artistic presence, whatever your tastes.
I:9802;1340;life is a powerful element in this movie, and the cinematography really fleshes out the fictional scenes to great effect.
I:9802;1341;one thing I love about Tim Burton is his symbolism.
I:9802;1342;in addition the characters are great, they are acted out with nice charisma and charm, and the running theme of the movie has to do with story.
I:9802;1343;telling and imagination itself .
I:9802;1344;so fundamental and ~SO~ good.
I:9802;1345;When Will receives a phone call from his mother telling him that his father is dying, he knows he must go to him and find out who his father really is and what is the truth about his life.
I:9802;1346;As the movie continues, Will finds out that not all of his father's stories are fantasy, and those that are have served a purpose in his life.
I:9802;1347;This is a beautifully told tale of fact vs. fancy, and the reconciliation of a father and son.
I:9802;1348;It is touching and is well.
I:9802;1349;I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch imaginative dramas.
I:9802;1350;It is actually a beautiful story.
I:9802;1351;A man tells tall tales.
I:9802;1352;this is one of my favorite tim burton film.
I:9802;1353;this movie is beautifully filmed and as all tim burton movies do, posesses a unique and creative atmophere in telling this wonderful story.
I:9802;1354;a truly great film with a wonderful cast and always brilliant director.
I:9802;1355;There is always something new to find each time I view it.
I:9802;1356;The characters remind me of certain family members, real, true, honest.
I:9802;1357;Another fantastic movie from Tim Burton!!!
I:9802;1358;Ewan McGregor does such a wonderful job at these types of movies!!!!
I:9802;1359;Tim Burton's return to genuine film making is a welcome endeavor indeed.
I:9802;1360;Here he creates a film that reminds me of what great film making is all about: fantasy, love and reflecting on the human spirit.
I:9802;1361;There is a unique carelessness and an innocence that resides perfectly and constantly in both films.
I:9802;1362;To me, both films are truly a breath of fresh air and hope.
I:9802;1363;big Fish is a book written by Daniel Wallace and is the delightful story of Edward Bloom, who has reached the twilight of his life and surrounds himself with his son, daughter.
I:9802;1364;law and his wonderful wife Sandra.
I:9802;1365;Eddie has seemingly lived a fantastic life of lies and exaggerations and his son has grown to call his bluff on more than one occasion.
I:9802;1366;In fact, his son returns not just to possibly say good.
I:9802;1367;Eddie is a mythological figure and that is just fine with him and as a viewer it's fine with me as well.
I:9802;1368;eddie is played by Albert Finney who is in turn mirrored by Eddie's youthful version, the outstanding Ewen MacGregor who once again proves his versatility.
I:9802;1369;She is a real find and makes you fall in love with her right along with Eddie.
I:9802;1370;Helena Bonham Carter brings her talents to the roles of The Witch and Jenny (or all of the other important women in Eddie's life).
I:9802;1371;Steve Buscemi shows up, which is always a pleasant surprise and of course Amos is played by Danny DeVito who is as enjoyable as ever.
I:9802;1372;let me just add that I believe Big Fish is a family film.
I:9802;1373;The language rises above the prime time television level once, there is blood only in a comedic and romantic fight sequence that has a truly admirable message and there is a women's nude rear displayed briefly and non.
I:9802;1374;The scene when Eddie fills an entire field with Sandra's favorite flower and stands in the middle of the field, outside of her window and calls out to her comes to mind.
I:9802;1375;It brings joy to my heart in a way that only a film like The Wizard of Oz can, and a small child should never ever miss that kind of message.
I:9802;1376;Big Fish is a smart film that really generates a ton of emotion and convincing special effects.
I:9802;1377;This film carried a sense of hope, pride, real love, respect, fantasy and the crucial element that films of these tainted times often forget: natural and unforced optimism.
I:9802;1378;He is the filmmaker that can put all of these elements together and for the first time tug at your emotions as well.
I:9802;1379;Secondly, it is pure, clean and full of moments we can all relate too.
I:9802;1380;"Tim Burton has made a film that will alienate his older fans who haven't matured like he has, without ""selling out"" (he's done that before) and he has made a film that the whole world can watch, enjoy and discover this unique filmmaker."
I:9802;1381;I'm glad that he saved some of his real film making inspiration for this wonderful little story.
I:9802;1382;big fish is a great film and steve buscemi rules he was the best actor in it along with ewan mcgregor.
I:9802;1383;me and my mates loved the poetry which was really great for example the sky so blue.
I:9802;1384;the grass so green i love specta.
I:9802;1385;i recomend this film for everyone and anyone to see it will bring tears to your eyes of laughter and sadness.
I:9802;1386;this is a film well thought out.
I:9802;1387;it's a match made in movie heaven.
I:9802;1388;When his father falls ill, he returns home with his pregnant wife and tries to get to the truth of the matter when it comes to his father's life.
I:9802;1389;i loved how the story kept going back and forth between the present day and the past.
I:9802;1390;Burton's imagination is one of the things I love about his films and he didn't cease to amaze me with this project.
I:9802;1391;Plus, all of the interesting characters brought into the story made the movie even more enjoyable.
I:9802;1392;Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor's performances were amazing.
I:9802;1393;Another aspect I loved was the relationship between Bloom and his wife.
I:9802;1394;You could still feel the love between the two characters.
I:9802;1395;It may just be a movie about tall tales, but it you'll leave feeling better about life.
I:9802;1396;Big Fish is a wonderful story delving into some of the complexities of a father son relationship.
I:9802;1397;Tim Burton excels with his development of this classic story.
I:9802;1398;All the actors made the fantasy real.
I:9802;1399;i am a huge fan of movies with fantasy components(Brazil, Moulin Rouge, etc.)and therefore found it puzzling that I disliked this movie so virulently.
I:9802;1400;"The doses of reality prevent us from properly entering the world of fantasy
I:9802;1401;The best movie about father/son relationships that has ever been made.
I:9802;1402;magical and poignant, it explores the beauty of life.
I:9802;1403;This movie will make you reflect about your life, your past, your legacy.
I:9802;1404;Watch it with someone you care about.
I:9802;1405;Tim Burton directs an enchanting story about storytelling and the magical properties of fantastic tales.
I:9802;1406;The story begins with the son, William Bloom, who has moved to France with his expecting wife, Sophie.
I:9802;1407;William is determined to find out the truth behind his father as everything that he has heard since childhood about his father has been fantastic imaginations about giants, miraculous adventures, and big mysterious fish.
I:9802;1408;Big Fish is a powerful cinematic experience as it combines the traditional and contemporary manners of storytelling and as the tale unfolds it leaves the audience with both entertainment and notions to ponder.
I:9802;1409;This is one of my favorite stories.
I:9802;1410;While it's all fantastical, there is such a beautiful lesson to be learned.
I:9802;1411;It is about Edward Bloom a man of great adventures, and a vivid imagination including witches,circuses,romance, werewolves, giants, fish with human characteristics, and many other things.
I:9802;1412;This is one of those truly entertaining movies.
I:9802;1413;If not for the movie's plot, for the stories it tells.
I:9802;1414;And Ed Bloom does have some stories to tell!
I:9802;1415;The adorable Billy Crudup (Will Bloom, Ed's son) was the only plot character that seemed to be missing some depth, but his dashing good looks forgive him for it.
I:9802;1416;hearted and loveable as the younger Bloom.
I:9802;1417;the admiration between Jessica Lange (the elder Mrs. Sandra Bloom) and Albert Finney is beautiful.
I:9802;1418;I loved the bathtub scene, where she climbs in with him, dress and all.
I:9802;1419;Can there be any other director who has carved such a perfect niche for himself as Tim Burton?
I:9802;1420;"The undoubted master of the ""adult fairytale"" tackles the issue of the relationship between Father and Son in the film 'Big Fish'."
I:9802;1421;With an impressive cast including Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup and Jessica Lange .
I:9802;1422;'Big Fish' is set up to succeed from the get.
I:9802;1423;What Burton has created is a humorous and yet moving journey through the fantastic life of one Edward Bloom as retold through a series of flashbacks.
I:9802;1424;The film strongly evokes memories of the equally surreal 'Edward Scissorhands' and the gently comedic fictional biopic 'Forrest Gump'.
I:9802;1425;this film is a heart.
I:9802;1426;warming, funny and quite mesmerising tale.
I:9802;1427;it is one of those films that makes you reassess some of your own relationships.
I:9802;1428;The acting is of a high calibre throughout .
I:9802;1429;I thought Lange's performance as the loving wife of Bloom was wonderfully understated in particular.
I:9802;1430;The supporting actors include the superb Steve Buscemi and Burton's old mate Danny De Vito.
I:9802;1431;this story will make you laugh and will warm the cockles of all but the most hard.
I:9802;1432;Highly recommended as a film for those prepared to sit back, suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy the ride.
I:9802;1433;Whilst this bears the undeniable Burton stamp, it is probably his most accessible .
I:9802;1434;out of all of tim burten's films this is without a dought his true master piece.
I:9802;1435;it has so much to say about one mans life story and how he meets his true life long long love.
I:9802;1436;its so very beautiful to the eyes as well.
I:9802;1437;I saw it in the theaters and then bought it for my own, and since watch it sevral times a year.
I:9802;1438;have a big box of tissues for the last 20 minutes of it, you Will need them.
I:9802;1439;Big Fish is brilliant, it is Tim Burton's best movie of his career.
I:9802;1440;Through his retellings, he meets a lot of strange, but interesting people.
I:9802;1441;There is Norther Winslow, played by Steve Buscemi, Amos Calloway, played by Burton regular, Danny DeVito.
I:9802;1442;There is also the family doctor, Dr. Bennett, played by Robert Guillaume.
I:9802;1443;The movie is brilliant, Tim Burton's best movie ever and his directing is brilliant without compromise.
I:9802;1444;The screenplay by John August, which is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, the screenwriter of Go, Titan A. e., Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.
I:9802;1445;"The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant and the end credits song ""Man Of The Hour"" by Pearl Jam is brilliant without compromise."
I:9802;1446;It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score and Best Original Song.
I:9802;1447;The movie also got a Golden Globe Best Picture nomination for a Musical or Comedy.
I:9802;1448;The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is brilliant.
I:9802;1449;The production and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Colleen Atwood is brilliant.
I:9802;1450;The film editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron is excellent.
I:9802;1451;The casting by Denise Chamian is superb.
I:9802;1452;The visual effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks is brilliant.
I:9802;1453;The performances by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast are amazing, especially from McGregor, Finney, and Crudup.
I:9802;1454;Casting them was a brilliant plan on Tim Burton's part.
I:9802;1455;It is a brilliant achievement for Burton and it is a masterpiece.
I:9802;1456;How it was made was intriguing because it seems that it was strange, but once I got used to the idea of the movie, it made me change my mind right away.
I:9802;1457;"It was a little bit like Burton's last masterpiece ""Ed Wood""."
I:9802;1458;I enjoyed that movie but I enjoyed this movie better, because it proves that Burton is a gifted filmmaker who knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it.
I:9802;1459;Go see this movie when you can get a chance because it is a brilliant movie that hit the top of my top 10 movies of 2003, and not because that, because of your opinion of the movie, which could change people's minds like it did with me.
I:9802;1460;this movie really warms the heart!
I:9802;1461;the acting is superb and message is relevant.
I:9802;1462;this is one of my favorite movies
I:9802;1463;The reason it was so good, i think, was because of the simplicity of it all.
I:9802;1464;The way Burton mixed fact with fiction was amazing.
I:9802;1465;Watching the way this son, who has a bad relationship with his father, react with the news that his father could be passing away very soon is amazing.
I:9802;1466;The acting in this fim is awesome.
I:9802;1467;The way the characters mature through this movie is outstanding.
I:9802;1468;This is an absolute must see for any fan of a good movie.
I:9802;1469;Tim Burton's creative genius has enabled him to create yet another world which is just aesthetically pleasing as it is deep.
I:9802;1470;The first 10 times I watched this, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:9802;1471;I thought it was a really awesome movie and one of the best that I've ever seen.
I:9802;1472;If I wrote this review back then, I probably would've given the movie 5 stars, but seeing as how my enjoyment for it has lessened since then, I decided to just give it 4 stars.
I:9802;1473;i think this movie deserves 4 stars because of the way it was filmed.
I:9802;1474;Ewan McGregor is a good actor, and this may not have been his best acting job, but what I really enjoyed about the character he played is that he (his character) had enduring love for his wife.
I:9802;1475;In one scene, there was a woman that he befriended who was coming on to him, and he told the woman that the only woman he loved and wanted to be with was his wife and then he left.
I:9802;1476;He tells these fantastical stories about the people he meets and the adventures that he's had, and some of the stories had a little something extra added to them.
I:9802;1477;His stories were true, but they were told with something a little more, just so he could make it interesting.
I:9802;1478;creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows.
I:9802;1479;Through these tales, the son begins to understand his father's great feats and his great failings.
I:9802;1480;i am a HUGE movie buff, and this is the best movie i have seen in a long time.
I:9802;1481;it is so imaginative and really brings you into the story.
I:9802;1482;tim burton really is a genius.
I:9802;1483;i would absolutely reccommend this movie to anyone who has good taste.
I:9802;1484;This is a wonderful movie that is good for the entire family.
I:9802;1485;Tim Burton directed this film, but it is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace.
I:9802;1486;Ed has been telling stories all of his life, to the complete enjoyment and captivation of everybody who hears them, except for his son, Will (Billy Crudup).
I:9802;1487;Even when they let Ed know that they already know the story, such as the one about the car and the maple tree, these women have such love for Ed on their faces.
I:9802;1488;But when Burton gives cinematic vision to Ed's stories we can see the magic as well as hear it.
I:9802;1489;This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace.
I:9802;1490;The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy.
I:9802;1491;The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation.
I:9802;1492;It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.
I:9802;1493;Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue.
I:9802;1494;It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .
I:9802;1495;the film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes, where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life.
I:9802;1496;We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a bank robber.
I:9802;1497;Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.
I:9802;1498;this is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of Forrest Gump and The Princess Bride .
I:9802;1499;Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange.
I:9802;1500;Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.
I:9802;1501;Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order.
I:9802;1502;Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.
I:9802;1503;jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect.
I:9802;1504;Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing.
I:9802;1505;It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co. stars.
I:9802;1506;billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.
I:9802;1507;Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of the senior Dr. Bennett.
I:9802;1508;The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.
I:9802;1509;The direction, however, is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.
I:9802;1510;This is an absolutely exceptional film.
I:9802;1511;I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.
I:9802;1512;This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton.
I:9802;1513;It is filmmaking at its best.
I:9802;1514;I can enjoy fantasy and symbolism in a movie, but the whimsical and circus.
I:9802;1515;Although, by the end of the film it does all makes more sense.
I:9802;1516;this is the kind of film that you could watch a second time and experience it again like new.
I:9802;1517;The son's character was well done, however.
I:9802;1518;the acting, directing, and special effects are good.
I:9802;1519;I imagine Tim Burton fans will enjoy this movie.
I:9802;1520;as far as moral content, it was refreshing to see a character choose to remain faithful to his wife.
I:9802;1521;The film is an entertaining version of a father /son conflict story.

I:9802;1524;In a season where I have been disappointed by film after film, Big Fish was a refreshing experience.
I:9802;1525;Tim Burton creates a magical story filled with the perfect elements of reality and imagination to explore ideas about family, life and most of all, love.
I:9802;1526;Albert Finney is funny and charming and Jessica Lange is dynamic as his counterpart.
I:9802;1527;"Ewan McGregor is absolutely magnetic and loveable, and Billy Crudup shines
I:9802;1528;Even smaller parts are superb, including performances by Alison Lohman, Robert Guillame, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Helena Bonham Carter and many more.
I:9802;1529;"the story line is clever, and the switch between present time and ""Ed"" time keeps the audience entertained."
I:9802;1530;There is just enough sweetness and laughter mixed in too, endearing the audience to the film and the stories unraveling on screen.
I:9802;1531;and the viewer is pullling for Ed all the way.
I:9802;1532;a nice feature, one that many films as of late have gotten wrong, is that Burton knows how to frame his film and how to end it.
I:9802;1533;This is a worthwhile film, a well.
I:9802;1534;told tale that is delightful with excellent performances, and is undoubtedly a film that should be viewed over and over to catch all the special twists and meanings.
I:9802;1535;goer, I was suprised how much I loved it!
I:9802;1536;The best word I can think to describe this movie is magical!
I:9802;1537;I really did love it.
I:9802;1538;All of the actors have incredible performances and I highly suggest seeing Big Fish ASAP.
I:9802;1539;I loved this movie so much I bought the soundtrack and book (I enjoyed both)
I:9802;1540;There will be a few other things, too.
I:9802;1541;A delightful afternoon of fantasy that touches the imagination in all of us.
I:9802;1542;This film has charm and fantasy and that is a combination that works (for me).
I:9802;1543;This one is fun and sweet and touching fun.
I:9802;1544;This movie perfectly describes a son's journey to find the truth in all his father's tall tales before his father dies.
I:9802;1545;"The story covers everything from love and adventure to the extended metaphor of the ""Big Fish."""
I:9802;1546;Even on the small screen, it was STILL excellent.
I:9802;1547;Fabulous movie all the way!
I:9802;1548;Yes, this is a likeable movie, but once you read the book, you'll realize not much is mentioned about Edward Bloom's ring cast into the river to get that catfish.
I:9802;1549;it is a movie suit for family watching~it expresses a father's heart in an interesting way.
I:9802;1550;ewan is an actor with a feeling of warmness.
I:9802;1551;Great story about how life can be more than you believe it to be.
I:9802;1552;I have viewed this movie many times and it never disappoints.
I:9802;1553;In the end, it is a surreal, touching story.
I:9802;1554;a darn good tear puller.
I:9802;1555;It isn't soaringly great, but it is truly well.
I:9802;1556;But for all of Crudup's weakness, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor give outstanding performances.
I:9802;1557;McGregor, who plays Crudup's father character as young man, shines with likeability and energy, the kind of person you meet rarely in life and who pulls you in with his joy and indefagitable innocence.
I:9802;1558;Finney is splended as a sputtering, kind.
I:9802;1559;Jessica Lange is fine in her small role, and the young actress who plays her character as a young woman (Alison Lohman) is almost too beautiful to be believed.
I:9802;1560;i really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!
I:9802;1561;It's gentle and provocative entertainment that is well worth seeing with the whole family.
I:9802;1562;I bought this movie ages ago and absolutely loved it.
I:9802;1563;The stories in the movie and the characters felt like my life.
I:9802;1564;star reviews) then it tends to be worth seeing.
I:9802;1565;tim Burton has grown with time to become one of the directors I respect the most, and with Big Fish he combined the talents of a host of great performers to deliver a movie that moved me like few flics have.
I:9802;1566;Maybe it was the fact that I am now in a point of my life, with my father over 75 years old and my son who is not even one, but I could identify with the main character and his struggle to dig the truth buried inside his father's extraordinary stories he grew up listening to over and over.
I:9802;1567;He has done it before and he did it again, and for that I thank him.
I:9802;1568;should you watch this movie?
I:9802;1569;Don't let other people's negative opinions about it push you away from it: you may find, like I did, that behind Burton's fantasy lies a world of truth and hope to be found.
I:9802;1570;I'm a BIG fan of ALL Tim Burton's films.
I:9802;1571;If anyone agrees with me, please vote at amazon, for the Ed Wood's realease.
I:9802;1572;I enjoyed this movie just fine, but it's one of those that you see once and never really need to see again.
I:9802;1573;I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor, and his performance was wonderful.
I:9802;1574;On the surface, this movie is a magical fairytale of one man's life.
I:9802;1575;That alone was fascinating and draws the viewer in from the start.
I:9802;1576;But at the core, it is the timeless story of a father.
I:9802;1577;An extremely emotional movie that grabs you from the beginning and thoroughly wrings you out by the end.
I:9802;1578;evaluate your own life and family dynamics.
I:9802;1579;I highly recommend this movie!
I:9802;1580;A truly beautiful story told beautifully.
I:9802;1581;There is a payoff, though, because Edward Bloom is a man larger than life and both of these actors successfully bring this character to the screen in larger.
I:9802;1582;edward Bloom loves to tell stories and his favorite ones have Edward Bloom as the main character.
I:9802;1583;His stories are entertaining to folks the first time they hear them.
I:9802;1584;His grown son loved the stories when he was young too, but now they are both older, the stories are no longer charming, and the son feels that he doesn't know his real father at all.
I:9802;1585;this scintillating film by Tim Burton lets us see the legendary side of Edward Bloom, and in bits and pieces it lets us in on where the fiction ends and the facts really lie.
I:9802;1586;The elderly Edward Bloom isn't against telling the truth, but he recognizes that there is more fun if there is flavor in the stories as well.
I:9802;1587;danny Elfman's score, as usual, provides the perfect compliment to a Burton film.
I:9802;1588;Supporting roles are wonderfully cast, such as Jessica Lange as the grown.
I:9802;1589;Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful in essentially three roles, as an old witch with a glass.
I:9802;1590;twin vaudeville singers are only a small part of the narrative which weaves back and forth between a wonderfully inventive fantasy world and the reality of the world of Edward Bloom.
I:9802;1591;Great life long adventure through incredible stories filled with witches, giants, mermaids, fish, siamese twins, war, peace, love and a werewolf.
I:9802;1592;Big Fish all I have to say about this movies is that it is great.
I:9802;1593;It is worth more than five stars in my book.
I:9802;1594;I don't know why but I was expecting something bigger, something more magical and exciting.
I:9802;1595;It came across as one of those Babe the Blue Ox stories I remember as a kid.
I:9802;1596;Well he seemed to get it, and since he did I paid more attention and I got a lot more of it too.
I:9802;1597;I would have believed anything he said, and Jessica Lange was teriffic in a very subtle performance.
I:9802;1598;all in all it is watchable and the performances of the supporting cast are very enjoyable despite a shaky plotline and some iffy acting from the leads.
I:9802;1599;Something in it for everyone.
I:9802;1600;BIG FISH is a wonderful family movie.
I:9802;1601;"I've seen this movie multiple times and it never gets old
I:9802;1602;Never could I recommend a better movie.
I:9802;1603;"Tim Burton's use of lighting and color in this film is stunning, especially during the scenes in the town of ""Spectre""."
I:9802;1604;Watch and you will be amazed.
I:9802;1605;Its imaginative beautiful funny and the actors are the best.
I:9802;1606;A classic must have that you will never forget.
I:9802;1607;The movie Big Fish is an elaborate tall tale woven into a clasic father and son story.
I:9802;1608;Bloom's stories, which were often a bother for his son, depict a man whose life is often exaggerated, yet full of adventure and zest.
I:9802;1609;The special effects in this movie are great and make it a very lively and enjoyable story.
I:9802;1610;The acting in Big Fish is also pretty good.
I:9802;1611;Ewan McGregor does a superior job playing the young Edward Bloom and Finnely and Crudup make a good father and son pair.
I:9802;1612;i would recommend this movie if you are interested in a touching story about father and son relationships, life and death, family, the South, and above of course tall tales.
I:9802;1613;It is a good movie to watch with your family but even if you watch it alone, I'll bet that the end of the movie will still tug at your heartstrings.
I:9802;1614;I'd strongly recommend this one, and I doubt that you will be disappointed.
I:9802;1615;Big Fish is one of those movies everyone should see.
I:9802;1616;He is on his deathbed and his son Edward who is played by Billy Crudup has come to make his reconciliation with his dad.
I:9802;1617;His fans will argue this as his best performance ever and I think it is.
I:9802;1618;He is enchanting in the movie.
I:9802;1619;He does a great job faking the accent and he just takes the role and runs with it.
I:9802;1620;It's really that great and an Oscar nomination should go his way.
I:9802;1621;He's just as good as Depp in Pirates and Penn in Mystic River.
I:9802;1622;This could be the best performance of his young carear.
I:9802;1623;i liked Billy Crudup in the movie.
I:9802;1624;Crudup plays with the emotions well.
I:9802;1625;He's a good actor and I hope to see more of his work in the future.You also have to love Albert Finney in the movie.
I:9802;1626;His character is loveable and he displays a spark that just makes you smile.
I:9802;1627;He's a loveable old guy and his performacne will and can draw tears.
I:9802;1628;tim Burton has just made a simply fantastic film.
I:9802;1629;He's a great director and has always made original and fun films.
I:9802;1630;They've always been a little werid, but it's always made them special.
I:9802;1631;big Fish is a great film.
I:9802;1632;Take the family to see it.
I:9802;1633;It's an enchanting and fun tale full of stories and memorable characters.
I:9802;1634;Come see one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see a movie.
I:9802;1635;Big Fish is just simply fantastic and is something everybody should see.
I:9802;1636;But, for the most part, it does work as a delicate, almost magical allegory.
I:9802;1637;It also contains some great performances, especially by Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter.
I:9802;1638;what if, when you were a kid, your father filled your head with fantastic stories of his own youth?
I:9802;1639;Stories about his encounters with a very big fish, amazing exploits in a war, encounters with a giant, his travels to a town that exists in its own space and time, etc.?
I:9802;1640;[Of great importance to the story is Will's mother [Lange], who loves Ed unconditionally and is enchanted by his wild tales.
I:9802;1641;But, of course, she loves Will unconditionally as well.]
I:9802;1642;As Will fights Ed, we see flashbacks of the young Ed [Ewan McGregor] living out these improbable tales in sequences of amazing visual detail.
I:9802;1643;At first, Will may have the upper hand, but as we watch, it is Ed who wins the battle and our hearts.
I:9802;1644;He may not have always told the truth, but it is his life, not Will's, which is the more heroic and worthwhile.
I:9802;1645;I have recommended it to many of my friends who have also enjoyed the movie.
I:9802;1646;While sad at parts, it's a movie that you walk out of with a huge smile on your face.
I:9802;1647;The relationship between a young man and his dying father takes center stage at this original movie, that seamlessly mixtures fantasy and reality in order to create a film well.
I:9802;1648;the son, William (Billy Crudup), wants to know more about his dad before it is too late, but is fed up with the incredible stories he always tell about himself.
I:9802;1649;But after telling a story many times, it becomes real to you, and Ed can't distinguish truth from lies any more.
I:9802;1650;"Ed doesn't stop telling tall tales, but the spectator will be happy for that due to the fact that thanks to the skill of the director of ""Big Fish"" (Tim Burton) Ed's stories come alive, and we are introduced to witches, giants, werewolves, the biggest fish in the river and even to the charmed town that young Ed (Ewan Mc Gregor) visited in his wandering days."
I:9802;1651;i highly enjoyed this movie, even though it made me cry a little at the end.
I:9802;1652;"I want to point out that the general tone is one of optimism, and that ""Big Fish"" is so visually engaging that you will believe you are living an extraordinary fairy tale."
I:9802;1653;I love good fairy tales!!!
I:9802;1654;This movie pulls at our hearts because it delivers on a very profound truth: the best way to love someone is to let their reality in.
I:9802;1655;This movie is a real gift.
I:9802;1656;There is an unseen spirit in our reality, a reality hard to capture or communicate.
I:9802;1657;This film presents that spirit beautifully and presents it as a most precious gift.
I:9802;1658;The story line was funny and yet sentimental.
I:9802;1659;Great movie with a great moral.
I:9802;1660;There are a lot of high expectations out there for Tim Burton's newest film, namely because it's getting more Oscar talk than just about any of his movies combined.
I:9802;1661;The movie starts off wonderfully, and reaches its pinnacle when the love of Edward's (played in his early years by Ewan McGregor) life enters the picture in a gorgeous moment during a circus.
I:9802;1662;Fish also has some really intelligent things to say about the nature of truth, the bond between fathers and sons, and the legacy of our lives.
I:9802;1663;the effect of Big Fish upon viewers will be mainly a choice.
I:9802;1664;Sure, Big Fish isn't perfect, it is manipulative, and it won't get any Oscars, but it still beats a great deal of 'family' fare out there right now.
I:9802;1665;Look carefully, too, and you'll see Ewan McGregor become a full.
I:9802;1666;There are so many movies out and this movie is completely original.
I:9802;1667;It tells the life of this guy who tells stories.
I:9802;1668;The end is also brilliant because although the movie doesn't really have a plot, it does have a conclusion.
I:9802;1669;You just have to see it and be entertained for two hours.
I:9802;1670;I have always loved this movie.
I:9802;1671;Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup do a fabulous job, and the story is magical.
I:9802;1672;This is a wonderful movie.
I:9802;1673;It is a great story with a lot of adventure.
I:9802;1674;This film has something for every type of movie fan.
I:9802;1675;The story is heartwarming and very entertaining.
I:9802;1676;This movie will leave everyone with a smile on their lips and a tear in their eyes.
I:9802;1677;It is a must see movie.
I:9802;1678;This film is soon to be known as one of the classic films.
I:9802;1679;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:9802;1680;It's just plain fun to watch.
I:9802;1681;After all the wonderful ads, I was really looking forward to this movie.
I:9802;1682;We are treated to many of those stories in a delightful series of flashbacks featuring Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom.
I:9802;1683;The retelling of these stories leads Will to do some investigating, and he is finally able to understand what kind of a man his father really is.
I:9802;1684;the performances in this film are fabulous.
I:9802;1685;Helena Bonham Carter also delivers an outstanding performance in her dual role.
I:9802;1686;Tim Burton does an amazing job creating the magical world of Edward's imagination: the visual effects are astonishing, and the whole film has Burton's creepy edge to it.
I:9802;1687;Big Fish is an amazing movie that is comical as well as sentimental.
I:9802;1688;Ewan MacGregor and evereybody else does a great job.
I:9802;1689;Just everything about this film is superb.
I:9802;1690;It manages to be sweet without being corny and sappy.
I:9802;1691;Tim Burton is a great director and from the previews Big Fish looked really great.
I:9802;1692;The visual are good, but they don't allow Tim Burton to show the viewer what he can do.
I:9802;1693;And he is great director.
I:9802;1694;Big Fish is an okay, but Tim Burton was allow to show his best work.
I:9802;1695;This was the best movie I saw in 2003 and really made my all time list.
I:9802;1696;casting was terrific, effects just right, not ove the top as they could have been.
I:9802;1697;Symbolic/metaphoric but my 11, 12 y/o kids liked it too.
I:9802;1698;This is one of my all time favorite movie since I ama proffesional storyteller.
I:9802;1699;"The tension between Reality and Fantasy, Truth and Lies has always held a particular fascination for Tim Burton: ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Batman"" for example and now, ""Big Fish."
I:9802;1700;ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young, Albert Finney as the old) is a dreamer, a storyteller and at times a buffoon who has managed his relationship with his son, Will (Billy Crudup) by telling fascinating and wondrous tales instead of being honest and straightforward.
I:9802;1701;And by doing so is he attempting to teach Will something more real and enduring than the factual retelling of the truth?The acting here is first rate, though McGregor seems to be building a career based on the same gee.
I:9802;1702;Jessica Lange, in her role as Ed's wife and Will's mother, is glorious: she is the repository of all that is good, truthful and faithful.
I:9802;1703;she is our dream mother and wife.
I:9802;1704;Big Fish loses steam in the middle section and could be cut by about 10 minutes but the final scenes bring everything back in focus and the last scene between Ed and Will is a doozy: cathartic and emotionally available.
I:9802;1705;I just watched it again with my young niece and again, I enjoyed it just as much as she did.
I:9802;1706;this movie catches the child's attention in all of us with its fairy.
I:9802;1707;tale qualities that keep you questioning the reality or fantasy based story line.
I:9802;1708;A great movie to address father.
I:9802;1709;son relationships as well as following your heart and ambition calls.
I:9802;1710;great for families, but also for all adults that would love to spend a few hours dreaming Big.
I:9802;1711;In spite of its wonderful cast and some imaginative vignettes, the movie as a whole is less than satisfying.
I:9802;1712;Billy Crudup does a beautiful job with a thankless character whose destiny of course is to become just like his father.
I:9802;1713;"Matthew McGory as Karl the giant is splendid in a role that could have been pure hokum
I:9802;1714;Finney is brilliant, and deserved a supporting actor nomination.
I:9802;1715;note, bigger than life bravado that undermines the film's strengths.
I:9802;1716;This is a great story that keeps fairly close to the storyline of the book (at least for a Hollywood film anyway).
I:9802;1717;This is what great movies are for and about.
I:9802;1718;"Filmmaking at its finest
I:9802;1719;I can't think of anyone but Tim Burton could have made such a wonderful film.
I:9802;1720;I have never laughed and cried so hard in the same movie before in all my life.
I:9802;1721;Beattlejuice is a prime example of this.
I:9802;1722;"William figures that all the great stories that his father has told him as he was growing up, are nothing more than lies and fabrications and slowly he makes the journey and researches these ""tall tales""
I:9802;1723;"(The similarity in terms of appearance between the ""young"" Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor) and the ""old"" Edward (Albert Finney) is astounding!"
I:9802;1724;Kudos to both for their brilliant acting.
I:9802;1725;Finally finding the love in his father's stories among the harsh reality of the world.
I:9802;1726;there are some amazing romantic moments in the film for all of us hopeless romantics.
I:9802;1727;The love between Edward and his wife (played by Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman) seem so honest, real and true.
I:9802;1728;"The ""drying out"" bath tub sequence, the field of daffodils and finally the Big Fish being released in the river of life, sealed with a kiss brought many of tear to my eye."
I:9802;1729;As son tells a final story for his father, a gift is passed from one generation to the other.
I:9802;1730;"(""American Beauty"" being the last.)"
I:9802;1731;"Still I'm afraid the epic ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" will walk way with all this years Oscar gold and justifiably so there hasn't been epic storytelling this good since the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy."
I:9802;1732;"Still why I realize that ""The Return of the King"" (and the other two ""Lord of the Rings"" films) are great I can't really say I was moved by them in."
I:9802;1733;"Which is just the opposite with ""Big Fish,"" I hope that good word of mouth will catch this tall (fantastic) tale some awards, hook line and sinker or shall I say line and wedding ring."
I:9802;1734;It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest.
I:9802;1735;Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart.
I:9802;1736;felt tale to the screen with his track.
I:9802;1737;big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall.
I:9802;1738;That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it.
I:9802;1739;After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon.
I:9802;1740;The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was.
I:9802;1741;McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating.
I:9802;1742;Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring.
I:9802;1743;And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.
I:9802;1744;overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high.
I:9802;1745;Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do.
I:9802;1746;Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice.
I:9802;1747;It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.
I:9802;1748;Combination of fantasy and realism makes a story of a life and how they tell it very entertaining.
I:9802;1749;i loved this movie, i am 19 yrs old and i would say that it is my generations Wizard of Oz.
I:9802;1750;i recommend watching this movie, but only if you have an imagination.
I:9802;1751;I thought that he did a superb job, considering how strong his normal Scottish accent is.
I:9802;1752;"But you seem to have thought Albert Finney is a ""native southerner"" when he is actually British!"
I:9802;1753;I thought Ewan and Albert complimented each other perfectly in this film.
I:9802;1754;All I can say is, this is my top three, maybe top two favorite film of all time!!
I:9802;1755;Everything about this movie is splendid and EVERYONE needs t oview this!
I:9802;1756;definetely Burtons best film ever!
I:9802;1757;child relationship is Burton's most personal film to date.
I:9802;1758;edward Bloom has been a personable man and a great storyteller all his life.
I:9802;1759;His fantastic tales have been loved by all, no matter how much truth or myth they may contain.
I:9802;1760;Estranged as adults, Will visits his dying father (Albert Finney) in hopes of learning the truth behind the magnificent tales of Edward's youth and gaining an understanding of the man he has known only through elaborate myths.
I:9802;1761;although Big Fish is telling us the story of Edward and Will's relationship, Edward, true to form, tells us his life's story in fantastic tales.
I:9802;1762;So the film spends most of its time recounting Edward Bloom's life story as he tells it, with young Edward played with great charm by Ewan McGregor.
I:9802;1763;These adventures are a visual feast and don't seem to compete with the film's present.
I:9802;1764;The myth and the drama are blended seamlessly, much to Tim Burton's and screenwriter John August's credit.
I:9802;1765;When activated, Fish Tales displays an icon on your screen during the film's playback that will take you to the relevant featurette.
I:9802;1766;The film's cast and director Tim Burton discuss the characters in interviews.
I:9802;1767;The second featurette is The Filmmaker's Path , which has four parts.
I:9802;1768;The production designer and effects coordinators discuss their role in expressing those themes.
I:9802;1769;The Fine Points: A Trivia Quiz is a game which allows you to view a short documentary about filming the circus scene if you answer the trivia questions.
I:9802;1770;Tim Burton's audio commentary has an unusual format.
I:9802;1771;Subtitles are available in English and French.
I:9802;1772;Dubbing is available in French.
I:9802;1773;It definitely feels like a 'Tim Burton' film in that it contains that fantastically unique level of fantasy that Burton is so well known for.
I:9802;1774;Not only does it tell a wonderful story, it is also so visually appealing.
I:9802;1775;I personally love films where the audience is treated to gorgeous visuals and a delicious display of color.
I:9802;1776;i understand that there are plenty of others who may not share my same thoughts and that is certainly alright.
I:9802;1777;I absolutely love Big Fish and recommend it to anyone who is already a fan of Tim Burton, enjoys films with beautiful visuals or simply loves to watch a good story come to life.
I:9802;1778;Excellent story of a son discovering his father: the man he never knew.
I:9802;1779;gives you good shivers when you see it.
I:9802;1780;This was very easy to download and show on demand.
I:9802;1781;"Keep that in mind as you watch ""Big Fish,"" for the fact and the fiction come together in a cohesive whole to paint a picture of the eccentric Edward Bloom in this touching, fanciful story of a father who tells tall tales and the son trying to make sense of them."
I:9802;1782;Considering the films' sweetness, warm nature and uplifting story, is surprised to learn that Tim Burton was on hand to direct.
I:9802;1783;"But in ""Big Fish,"" Burton shows his emotional range, reportedly taking the project after the death of his own father."
I:9802;1784;Through various stroytellers and listeners, we learn Edwards' remarkable life story: meeting witches, giants, werewolves, swampy utopias, his romantic hook up with his wife (Allison Loman and Jessica Lange), his fighting in Korea and saving that same Utopia he had visited earlier in his life.
I:9802;1785;"This web of stories are expertly woven by, not only Burton, but also screenwriter John August (""Go"") who fill the story, not only with idyllic images of Americana and plenty of good."
I:9802;1786;natured humor, but with an emotional core that one cannot help but connect with.
I:9802;1787;and that core is done justice by an excellent acting ensemble, led by the lovable Albert Finney as the aging Bloom an Ewan McGregor and the younger.
I:9802;1788;Their performances perfectly match, weaving a character as fanciful as his stories but also as real as his disease.
I:9802;1789;Look for Finney to take home an Oscar for his work.
I:9802;1790;Billy Crudup is wonderful as well as the doubting Will, who softens throughout the film, leading to a tear.
I:9802;1791;jerker scene in which, by telling his own story, Will shows he understands his father.
I:9802;1792;"One of the surprise best of the year, ""Big Fish"" will leave you believing in those tall tales again, and Tim Burton's filmmaking abilities."
I:9802;1793;I enjoyed the movie very much right up until the contrived narrated ending.
I:9802;1794;I was touched by the scene of the son himself finally reconciling with his dying father by helping his father create the father's 'final story'.
I:9802;1795;That was very good and that idea ~could have been~ the 'closer'.
I:9802;1796;great story of believing in yourself even when nobody does and great crew of actors besides.
I:9802;1797;I give it 2 stars for cinematography and acting.
I:9802;1798;my husband loves it and wanted me to see it, so I said yes.
I:9802;1799;My husband was never a good judge of movies.
I:9802;1800;never trust a film packed full of big time well known actors.
I:9802;1801;It is most likely that they are hoping the actors will carry the film, and they did, but not nearly far enough.
I:9802;1802;And I had high hopes!
I:9802;1803;First of all, the visuals are some of Tim Burton's best to date.
I:9802;1804;The multiple fantasy worlds he has created are some of the most unique ever put to film.
I:9802;1805;The acting is extremely strong, especially Albert Finney(old Edward), Ewan McGregor(young Edward), Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi(very funny role), and even the little known Billy Crudup as Edward's truth seeking son.
I:9802;1806;All the rest of the cast are great as well, but have much smaller roles.
I:9802;1807;Even though this film is full of funny and amusing situations, it is still at heart a serious and moving film.
I:9802;1808;This film will be watched by many for years to come, and some have already called it Burton's masterpiece.
I:9802;1809;son story that breathes life and warmth into an already beautiful looking film.
I:9802;1810;As the wisest people claim that true beauty is on the inside rather than the outside, is only but a half truth as with some of Edward's stories in this film.
I:9802;1811;Because in this rare instance, Burton has made a film that is imaginative and beautiful inside and out.
I:9802;1812;Tim Burton has created the best mix of fantasy and drama that Hollywood has ever seen.
I:9802;1813;Burton mostly known for his fantasy side directs with his usual brilliance.
I:9802;1814;"Although my loyalty lies with ""Beetlejuice"" as my favorite Burton film, ""Big Fish"" is an excellent addition to Burton's list of some of the most magical motion pictures ever to come out of Hollywood."
I:9802;1815;The cast is superb, the set decor is out of this world, and the story is a piece of mind blowing fiction.
I:9802;1816;Composer Danny Elfman is phenomenal, his music scores always add so much to Tim Burton's films.
I:9802;1817;It's a masterpiece in every way, after watching it again today I was reminded of just how great it truly is.
I:9802;1818;Big Fish gives new meaning to tall tales.
I:9802;1819;Really, it's one heck of a fish story.
I:9802;1820;And now that I've got that out of my system I'll move on to the review.
I:9802;1821;edward Bloom has always been destined for bigger things.
I:9802;1822;And his stories are the stuff of legend.
I:9802;1823;He packed a lot of living into his years.
I:9802;1824;And a certain wedding speech alienates them for three years until Edward is diagnosed with cancer.
I:9802;1825;While visiting his dad, flashbacks to Edward's incredible life come through and we see how he left his home town, his time with the circus, his time with the army, and most important, how he met his wife and love of his life.
I:9802;1826;characters:Albert Finney: Old Edward BloomEwan McGregor: Young Edward BloomChristopher Mcpherson Jr.: Child Edward BloomJessica Lange: Sandra K. BloomAlison Lohman: Young Sandra K. BloomBilly Crudup: William BloomMarion Cotillard Josephine BloomHelena Bonham Carter: Witch/JennyHailey Anne Nelson: Young JennyRobert Guillaume: Dr. BennettMatthew McGrory: KarlDanny DeVito: Amos CallowaySteve Buscemi: Norther WinslowEwan McGregor has the largest part in this movie and he does very well.
I:9802;1827;He's completely cocky and fitting to the personality of Edward.
I:9802;1828;And he's a good storyteller.
I:9802;1829;She plays a quiet part, but acts completely devoted to Edward and makes the relationship beautiful.
I:9802;1830;I especially loved the tub scene between the two (and no it's not as dirty as it sounds).
I:9802;1831;The other characters are in and out of the movie at irregular intervals, but they are all unique and special.
I:9802;1832;I think they chose well for the parts as everyone is funny without being over the top.
I:9802;1833;But it was interesting and I can't say that I've ever seen something like it before.
I:9802;1834;Unlike most of Burton's movies where everything is dark, this one has a lot of light.
I:9802;1835;up towns, a bright circus, performance during war, everything has a lot of color.
I:9802;1836;It's a pleasure to watch because of it.
I:9802;1837;And even the special effects, although somewhat cheesy, are well done.
I:9802;1838;I especially enjoyed the catfish that was featured throughout the movie.
I:9802;1839;big Fish is a good movie.
I:9802;1840;It has a lot of emotion and while it's not perfect, it is perfectly enjoyable.
I:9802;1841;One of Tim Burton's absolute best.
I:9802;1842;Big Fish is a beautiful story with incredible performances by all cast members.
I:9802;1843;This is perhpas Tim Burton's best movie ever.
I:9802;1844;Great lessons on love, the importance of marriage, how to accept our loved ones as they are and how to enjoy life.
I:9802;1845;lavish production and great cinema techniques can't save this film from being just a random mish.
I:9802;1846;mash of fantasy dream elements strung together in the semblance of a story.
I:9802;1847;it is simply forgetable and not entertaining.
I:9802;1848;I can't help but smile (even when I bawl like a baby at the end) every time I watch it.
I:9802;1849;This film has such a positive message that motivated me to get back to the imaginative mindset that I had as a kid, rather than letting the negative, realistic influences in society today get to me.
I:9802;1850;You're missing out on something wonderful if you haven't seen this film.
I:9802;1851;My one fear with this movie is that it will be overlooked.
I:9802;1852;Beautifully shot and acted, if you let it, this story will take you into a world filled with kindness, family, and fantasy.
I:9802;1853;fast shiping great movie give it a 10 not many good movies out their clean kids can even watch great movie.
I:9802;1854;It is beautifully made, the story is superb, the acting is top.
I:9802;1855;drawer, and this may be one of Tim Burton's best films .
I:9802;1856;Really good father son love story.
I:9802;1857;just alot of fun and heartbreaking at the same time.
I:9802;1858;Good life messages and funny.
I:9802;1859;I have watched several times and sure I will again.
I:9802;1860;What I didn't expect was that it would capture me from the very improbable beginning, and keep me hooked throughout the entire film.
I:9802;1861;"The writing is superb
I:9802;1862;There are tender and touching scenes, laugh.
I:9802;1863;"loud scenes, and ""where is my kleenex when I need it"" scenes, yet all are woven together in a masterfully told tale of truth."
I:9802;1864;This movie is definitely a keeper, and I intend to own it, so that I can watch it again and again.
I:9802;1865;The acting was excellent, the directing was beyond measure, yet I still believe it was the STORY of the Big Fish that made this such a terrifically enjoyable movie.
I:9802;1866;I give it a resounding A+++
I:9802;1867;Big fish will make you laugh and cry at the same time.
I:9802;1868;It discusses the importance of love, family, friends and life in general.
I:9802;1869;Its they way you live it that counts.
I:9802;1870;The actors are amazing and naturally, Ewan McGregor is fanominal.
I:9802;1871;for all ages and genders, this movie will touch you in some way.
I:9802;1872;like movie will leave you with a smile and warm fuzzy feeling all over.
I:9802;1873;This film is one of my favorites.
I:9802;1874;ewan McGregor does a fantastic job as the main character but the crux of this film is the relationship between he and his son.
I:9802;1875;Through his father's stories, one thread remained true, family was always family.
I:9802;1876;like most of us, Ewan McGregor was a mix of fact and fiction.
I:9802;1877;"As we find in the end of the film, many of the ""characters"" from the ""tall tales"" were real people that knew and loved Billy Crudup's father."
I:9802;1878;a life well lived can be quiet and uneventful but a life well lived can also be told in technicolor.
I:9802;1879;We are called to dream the dreams and make our imaginations color our worlds.
I:9802;1880;It makes you believe in true love standing the test of time again.
I:9802;1881;Time really does stand still when you first see your true love, that may be the enduring legacy of this film, that life is what you make it, even if you make it up as you go along!
I:9802;1882;Exaggerated, unreal and totally engrossing we all created fantastic, dream.
I:9802;1883;"the retelling of Ed's highly entertaining, charming, enthusiastic, at times very funny and, of course, ridiculously unbelievable tales which provide a bizarrely surrealistic canvas that's perfectly suited to Tim Burton's skills in creating ""fantastic"" cinematic visualisations."
I:9802;1884;His stories enrich his own life but their telling is a completely self.
I:9802;1885;"On the one hand, they reveal a wonderfully romantic man who only sees the beautiful and exciting things in life and whose memories amplify the ""good things"" out of all proportion to reality
I:9802;1886;And here's where the real interest of the film lies.
I:9802;1887;"provoking and deeply reflective insight into life, culminating in an intensely moving ""twist"" in which the son weaves an equally idealistic dream."
I:9802;1888;"story of the perfect death for his father, as he's dying, and, in doing so, realises that exaggerating the ""truth"" can be a powerful source of joy."
I:9802;1889;"beautifully constructed and superbly acted the question ""Big Fish"" poses is, ""is it wrong for an adult to exaggerate things in such a childish way?"""
I:9802;1890;well that's for you to decide, but, if you can suspend disbelief and remember what it was like to fantasise, it will absolutely enthral you.
I:9802;1891;The acting by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney is just incredible.
I:9802;1892;tim Burton did a great job on Big Fish.
I:9802;1893;Tim Burton is a great stroryteller and this movie is another one to add to the list.
I:9802;1894;The scenery in the movie is very rich (especially in the circus).
I:9802;1895;I loved it the first time I saw it and will watch it again and again.
I:9802;1896;Director Tim Burton has never really made a film quite this sentimental before and after seeing Big Fish he was long overdue.
I:9802;1897;This film is a very touching and enchanting tale about a father and son trying to mend their paths.
I:9802;1898;Ewan Mcgregor is very impressive in this movie, he just seems to shine with optimistic purity.
I:9802;1899;Albert Finney as the same character in the dusk of his years is equally affecting.
I:9802;1900;The only weak link is Billy Crudup who is very wooden and dry, but the film works nonetheless.
I:9802;1901;There is a magic in Burton's best works, and Big Fish is definatly one of these.
I:9802;1902;Even if your not a regular Burton fan check it out, it may surprise you.
I:9802;1903;I received the package promptly after placing my order.
I:9802;1904;Everything was in great condition.
I:9802;1905;for a price I was willing to pay.
I:9802;1906;Oh well, you can't win al the time.
I:9802;1907;I can still watch where ever there is an internet connection and device.
I:9802;1908;(I confess I have yet to read the book.)
I:9802;1909;big Fish is, in my opinion, a masterpiece.
I:9802;1910;As much as I loved Return of the King's apocryphal Lord of the Rings, Big Fish was the best picture last year (incidentally, Finding Nemo receives my vote for runner up).
I:9802;1911;By wonderful I do not mean great.
I:9802;1912;I mean those things that are full of wonder.
I:9802;1913;Be they things that put us in awe, or things that merely make us smile, we have all forsaken, at least to a degree, the wide.
I:9802;1914;assuredness in the everyday to ever wake to the true and the beautiful?Not really.
I:9802;1915;This is a really wonderful story about a larger than life man, and his son's struggles to know who his father really is.
I:9802;1916;i really recomend this film .
I:9802;1917;It has great acting, beautiful costumes and is such a fantastical inspring story.
I:9802;1918;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:9802;1919;It's truly a great story.
I:9802;1920;Tim burton tells a beautiful story.
I:9802;1921;This is one movie I can watch over and over again.
I:9802;1922;This is one of the best movies to I've seen in a while.
I:9802;1923;I really loved the way the story is told .
I:9802;1924;and is suitable for children!
I:9802;1925;I love this movie and was happy I could give as a gift for someone special
I:9802;1926;If you want a film that has heart, real characters, and a social conscience (rooted in real human dilemmas of a single family in Prague), then choose the Czech bittersweet comedy, AUTUMN SPRING, starring a charismatic 75.
I:9802;1927;Watch the real implications of fish tales with a real storyline, not a rehashed version of OZ.
I:9802;1928;Fun drama filled with personalities and the adventures in a mans life.
I:9802;1929;adapted from the novel by daniel wallace is a film that captures the imagination and the emotions.
I:9802;1930;directed by Tim Burton, and a music score by danny Elfman combines to make a wonderful feelgood family movie.
I:9802;1931;Fantastic story rich with life messages and emotion.
I:9802;1932;It was interesting to compare the film with the Broadway musical.
I:9802;1933;Although the emphasis differs between the two media, both are wonderful in their own right.
I:9802;1934;a great movie enjoyed by everyone.
I:9802;1935;the ending leaves everyone with tears in there eyes.
I:9802;1936;would recommend to everyone that it is a must see.
I:9802;1937;Has become one of my all time favorites.
I:9802;1938;The screenplay is fantastic and Burton did a great job incorporating his style into it.
I:9802;1939;One of my favorite films.
I:9802;1940;Big Fish the reality that something you believe in will change your feelings and make you cry, laugh and leave the room with a tear and a smile on your face.
I:9802;1941;But, it takes someone like Tim Burton to really give life into this life journey.
I:9802;1942;This is why I probably enjoyed the film much more than the book.
I:9802;1943;I remembered alot of the plot but seeing it through Will made a big difference.
I:9802;1944;packed with lots of features which Tim Burton fans will enjoy.
I:9802;1945;Also, it shows how a simple story can be great through a creative mind like Burton.
I:9802;1946;Sometimes, we just have to open our minds a little bit to see the big picture.
I:9802;1947;Maybe not for everyone, but I think this is one of the best movies ever made.
I:9802;1948;this has become a family favorite and we have watched it as a family more then a dozen times over the years!
I:9802;1949;This is by far, the best movie ever.
I:9802;1950;I was so moved not only because of the fact that the plot is wonderful, but because it was like looking me in a mirror.
I:9802;1951;One tells stories to amused people and sometimes they don't like them, or don't enjoy them but in a way, that stories are building up memories that will never be forgotten.
I:9802;1952;If you want to watch Ewen McGregor grin his way through a movie, then this is the film for you, otherwise watch Ed Wood again to see a real classic.
I:9802;1953;Overall, a very heart moving movie with strong performances by Albert Finney, Danny de Vito, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor.
I:9802;1954;Then, there are also three Oscar winners in the production crew such as costume designer, director of cinematography, special effects designer Stan Winston.
I:9802;1955;Timeless and appealing to all ages.
I:9802;1956;"This is especially true for anyone who sometimes wonders, ""How did I come from this family?"""
I:9802;1957;And he combines personal life experience with his own visionary cinematography style to create an enchanting, unique, and moving film.
I:9802;1958;This film is a celebration of life, and those who truly live it.
I:9802;1959;Great story line and a bit strange but ending wraps it all up and most likely will make you cry.
I:9802;1960;Decided to watch it after daughter saw the play on Broadway and said how much she loved it.
I:9802;1961;Big Fish is one of those movies I can always sit through and enjoy.
I:9802;1962;It's easily one of Tim Burton's best and brightest movies.
I:9802;1963;In a rare departure from the dark and the macabre, Burton tells the story of a son reconciling with his dying father and his larger than life tales about his life.
I:9802;1964;Burton tells the story with a fantastic colorful palette, retreating from his darker visions, to tell a story that embraces it's larger than life hero.
I:9802;1965;son bond, Big Fish is a tribute to the art of storytelling and oral tradition, and how, no matter what, there is a grain of truth to all these tall tales.
I:9802;1966;They make the movie fun.
I:9802;1967;When Burton takes us back to the present, real world, robbed of the fanciful elements, we've been on a fun ride and are ready to get to the emotional payoff.
I:9802;1968;the production on this film is fabulous.
I:9802;1969;From the colorful shots, fantastic scenery and costumes, the ubiquitous Danny Elfman score (arguably one of his best), this is a near perfect movie and is easily one of my favorite Tim Burton films.
I:9802;1970;wow he really phoned it in.
I:9802;1971;i enjoyed this movie so much that i bought two more for friends and the quility is great .
I:9802;1972;and it has become my favorite movie.
I:9802;1973;This is such a great movie.
I:9802;1974;The imagination behind this story and how it is brought to life is incredible!
I:9802;1975;Every once in a good while, the impact of a particular entertainment format is wholly contingent upon the emotional tapestry the viewer/listener brings to it.
I:9802;1976;this is a classic example.
I:9802;1977;"burtoneque projects to come from Tim Burton, ""Big Fish"" is a mesmerizing fairy tale wonderfully reminicsent of the underrated ""Edward Scissorhands"" more than a decade ago."
I:9802;1978;Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought.
I:9802;1979;He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenom with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form.
I:9802;1980;As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age.
I:9802;1981;Albert Finney is simply captivating.
I:9802;1982;I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast.
I:9802;1983;While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents.
I:9802;1984;Ewan McGregor personfies charm as the young Edward Bloom.
I:9802;1985;this is a wonderful dissertaion on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father.
I:9802;1986;It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.
I:9802;1987;visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was.
I:9802;1988;i highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again.
I:9802;1989;Keeps moving at an adequate pace to keep interest, although it is somewhat predictable.
I:9802;1990;well directed and believable acting.
I:9802;1991;I really enjoyed the cast and the story.
I:9802;1992;It was very well directed.
I:9802;1993;Big Fish is one of my favorite movies ever.
I:9802;1994;I live with a man who is an embellish.
I:9802;1995;er so perhaps based on my life experience I can appreciate the movie more so than the people who just don't get it.
I:9802;1996;Jessica Lange performance is so heart warming.
I:9802;1997;Tim Burton has created another whimsical masterpiece, this time with a much lighter tone.
I:9802;1998;His use of dazzeling colors and images enhance an engaging story about a father and son discovering themselves and each other.
I:9802;1999;Watched this with my mom and we laughed a lot because it reminded us of someone we miss in our family.

I:9802;2001;ray titles play fine, however.
I:9802;2002;I'm exited to see the broadway version of this epic movie!
I:9802;2003;This movie is very sweet and made me cry
I:9802;2004;Big Fish is my all time favorite movie.
I:9802;2005;The first few times i saw it, i cried at the end.
I:9802;2006;It's a little slow at one or two scenes, but it's such a great movie.
I:9802;2007;It's made of a lot of little stories, that all connect with each other.
I:9802;2008;Visually they are an absolute treat.
I:9802;2009;full of invention and a sense of almost childlike wonder.
I:9802;2010;bIG FISH presents us with the best of his good traits, and frankly, the worst of his lesser habits.
I:9802;2011;visually the movie is stunning.
I:9802;2012;Sets and costumes are whimsical, in the best sense.
I:9802;2013;Dad always just told fanciful stories about his life and adventures.
I:9802;2014;and now the son wants the truth, darn it, so he can know dad.
I:9802;2015;Dad tells some of his old stories again, and the movie shows them played out for us.
I:9802;2016;He just keeps telling them.
I:9802;2017;"aLISON LOHMAN, as the younger Lange, has a great blend of freshness and ""spunk."""
I:9802;2018;She was great in MATCHSTICK MEN and good in WHITE OLEANDER, and her winning streak continues here.
I:9802;2019;HELENA BONHAM CARTER is okay in a strange role as one of the many people McGregor meets.
I:9802;2020;top accent and goofy smile are EXACTLY the same.
I:9802;2021;As appealing as McGregor is (he just seems like such a nice guy!)
I:9802;2022;truly tim burton's masterpiece, it cracks you up, gets you so involved and wrapped up in it, it's hard to let it end!
I:9802;2023;the acting by the entire cast is wonderful, the cinematography is breathtaking, the story so full of imagination, humor, and heartwarming events, you may find it irrestable as i did, and view it all over again.
I:9802;2024;it is, at times, astounding!
I:9802;2025;"people can leave feeling like they just actually enjoyed an ""art"" film that wasn't actually an art film."
I:9802;2026;A hero is only heroic when there's real danger involved and Ed never faces real danger because he always knows he'll live through it.
I:9802;2027;"including the woman that he paylessly worked at a circus for three years to find because he ""loved"" her so much ."
I:9802;2028;I don't really see how I can respect that in a character.
I:9802;2029;for me, I prefer at least a semblance of story in a film.
I:9802;2030;original well done special effects as usual abound.
I:9802;2031;casting another brilliant actor jessica lange as his wife.
I:9802;2032;It definitely deserves *four stars* as its a very good Movie!
I:9802;2033;Funny what a decade can do, huh?
I:9802;2034;Perhaps, this film is the best Burton has done to date.
I:9802;2035;it is a weird and wonderful tale about a Father and Son, life and death and alienation and reconciliation.
I:9802;2036;it is a story of Edward Bloom, masterfully played by both Albert Finney (as the elderly Bloom) and Ewan McGregor (as the younger Bloom).
I:9802;2037;As an adult child Will comes home when he learns that he father is dying and attempts to discover the truth behind the tales, thinking that the truth will bring reconciliation and intimacy between father and son.
I:9802;2038;What he does discover is that sometimes the tale is better than the truth.
I:9802;2039;i was touched by the love story that supported the plot between Bloom and his wife (played by Jessica Lange).
I:9802;2040;It was good to see Lange act in an older plot.
I:9802;2041;death.Yes, this movie deals with death, but it is a funny, engaging, touching, and both weird and wonderful.
I:9802;2042;If you are looking for an evenings entertainment, this movie is for you.
I:9802;2043;Big Fish is my favorite movie, and will be until something better comes along.
I:9802;2044;I am extremely impressed with this and think that Mr. burton and I have much in common.
I:9802;2045;One of my favorite characters is Karl the giant.
I:9802;2046;"I guarantee most people will love ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;2047;He has tall tales to tell to everyone who'll listen, and to some who won't want to.
I:9802;2048;According to him, he has lived a big life, with big things, big events, big characters (literally!)
I:9802;2049;just as much as a story of Edward Bloom's grand persona, this is a tale about a father and a son finally seeing eye to eye.
I:9802;2050;Throughout his life he meets amazing characters like Karl, the circus folk (including DeVito as the ringleader), the singing Chinese siamese twins, the hometown poet (Buscemi) and the people at the fabled town of Spectre.
I:9802;2051;the acting in the film is pretty good, especially Finney, McGregor and Crudup, but the best thing about this movie is its setting.
I:9802;2052;in the end, Big fish is a lovely tale about a father and a son, and the many tall tales that separated them and then joyned them in the end.
I:9802;2053;"With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one ""big fish story"" after another."
I:9802;2054;the title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously.
I:9802;2055;On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character.
I:9802;2056;"On the other, Bloom is, himself, the ""big fish"" in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him."
I:9802;2057;scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.
I:9802;2058;The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner .
I:9802;2059;our interest picks back up.
I:9802;2060;That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.
I:9802;2061;burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion.
I:9802;2062;The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role.
I:9802;2063;Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange).
I:9802;2064;Billy Crudup brings a subtle depth to the role of William and the scenes between him and Finney truly touch the heart.
I:9802;2065;Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito round out the impressive cast.
I:9802;2066;"I'll just say that any flick that can make me laugh, cry, say ""wow!"""
I:9802;2067;", think ""aw, that's sweet!"""
I:9802;2068;See a longer review for more details about the movie.
I:9802;2069;The internet movie database will tell you if it's on soon.
I:9802;2070;It's a wonderful, delightful, very unusual movie.
I:9802;2071;Quite possibly the most overrated movie of recent times.
I:9802;2072;Burton does it again with his wonderfully animated storytelling.
I:9802;2073;This is both beautifully illustrated/animated as well as eloquently told.
I:9802;2074;This time, he did have a real situation combined with the very heavily laden fantastic unreal stories of a man who ultimatly is the BIG FISH.
I:9802;2075;this definatly is a good date movie and one that should not be missed.
I:9802;2076;I found it refreshing and very sweet.
I:9802;2077;This is a wonderful story, already well.
I:9802;2078;It is simply a fun movie to watch, and one that you can go back to and watch again.
I:9802;2079;I think children over 12 would easily understand and enjoy the movie.
I:9802;2080;I've seen this before and I liked it then too.
I:9802;2081;Very well written, directed and acted.
I:9802;2082;Well worth a couple hours.
I:9802;2083;I highly recommend this movie.
I:9802;2084;One of the few times that watching a movie has made me want to read the book.
I:9802;2085;It is such a touching story with depth.
I:9802;2086;This movie was the best movie of 2004, so far.
I:9802;2087;It is so creative and the ideas are genius.
I:9802;2088;ok kidding aside this movie was good and fun.
I:9802;2089;this is an opinion and it just so happens that Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors.
I:9802;2090;I mean look at his resume, Pee Wee Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, not to mention making the best comic book movie ever, Batman, and the also awesome sequel, Batman Returns, that has jim varney(ernest) in it
I:9802;2091;Big Fish has great acting, splendid directing and incredible cinematography.
I:9802;2092;This film is the most underrated movie of the year.
I:9802;2093;It did well at the box office, and scored well with critics but when Oscar time came around we only had one nod.
I:9802;2094;This is among Tim Burton's finest creations.
I:9802;2095;The story, effects, acting, score, and humor all come together beautifully in this film and no one ever noticed.
I:9802;2096;Best Acting goes out to Jessica Lange who wins the crowd with her devoted wife role.
I:9802;2097;I reccomend this film to everyone.
I:9802;2098;Take The Wizard of Oz and mix it up with Forrest Gump and you have Big Fish.
I:9802;2099;Tim Burton has made yet another film classic.
I:9802;2100;Take all his previous films (Batman, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands) and turn them all upside down.
I:9802;2101;The effects, the acting, the score, and the cinematography were all superb.
I:9802;2102;This film is for everyone to see.
I:9802;2103;This is a great epic film directed by Tim Burton with a wonderful supporting cast.
I:9802;2104;Book is by Daniel Wallace and he was pleased with how Tim Burton conveyed it onto the screen.
I:9802;2105;This was a gift and it came very fast.
I:9802;2106;This is one of my favorite Tim Burton movies, a very interesting story with great images.
I:9802;2107;Enjoyed watching the movie again: it is a classic.
I:9802;2108;Its been one of my favorites from the moment I saw it.
I:9802;2109;I love stories and story telling, and this movie is all about it.
I:9802;2110;The fantasy is so fun!
I:9802;2111;its good to see a movie that aint like anything else!
I:9802;2112;And with the star studded cast its definately worth a watch.
I:9802;2113;Always been a big fan of Ewan Mcgregor and I gotta say this is one of the best films Ive seen him do.
I:9802;2114;albert Finney is just wonderful.
I:9802;2115;billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Robert Guillaume, Danny De Vito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alison Lohman all make this film simply beautiful.
I:9802;2116;this Tim Burton Movie has his magic to make it work.
I:9802;2117;Its a heart warming film with some great morals behind it.
I:9802;2118;big thumbs up from me.
I:9802;2119;"selling novel by Daniel Wallace, ""Big Fish"" brings a larger."
I:9802;2120;life story to the screen, in such a heartwarming and unique way that it provides an escape from the numerous violent films of the fall and still manages to entertain every member of the entire family.
I:9802;2121;"acclaimed films such as ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" to his credit), ""Big Fish"" follows the story of Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) who has spent his entire life telling sky."
I:9802;2122;ridden with cancer, he tells his life story to his son, and we as the audience are swept away into a fantasy world only creatable from the imagination of Tim Burton.
I:9802;2123;eyed witches, giants, and conjoined twin lounge singers, the effects are stunningly creative and a literal visual feast for the eyes.
I:9802;2124;The love story between Edward and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) is touching, emotional, and well.

I:9802;2126;carter) are all fantastic, and add an extra punch to the storyline.
I:9802;2127;Brilliant costumes and sets also illuminate the screen, and help to bring the world of Edward Bloom to life.
I:9802;2128;Big Fish is by far one of the most imaginative films this fall, and with a strong cast and script that satisfies every member of the family.
I:9802;2129;goers, as they will be entertained by the magic happening on the screen.
I:9802;2130;While this film has entertainment value, the content is more of a serious nature.
I:9802;2131;Big Fish brings out the magic of the workings of our memories that while there might be even a significant underlying truth and actual events to every story, our perception and memories are also influenced and even dominated by our emotions at the time of such events and later on again when retelling and/or expressing such memories.
I:9802;2132;It's the memories that nobody can steal from us and which we carry with us throughout our lives.
I:9802;2133;We are creative individuals and this is what makes each one of us so very interesting and valuable.
I:9802;2134;That's what this film brings out in a really exceptional way and that's why it is a literal masterpiece.
I:9802;2135;true, this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but nevertheless it is a sweet story, and makes you think about yourself and other people in your life, as it is also a true classic motion picture event.
I:9802;2136;The acting is absolutely superb as it is always the case with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor does a great job too.
I:9802;2137;The scenery is beautiful and the photography is exceptional, and sure you will find some of Tim Burton's trademark shocking or even somewhat scary moments, but always the humorous relief.
I:9802;2138;By far, one of the best movies that has come out in a while.
I:9802;2139;It seemed to meander, providing a fantastic, satyrical Burtonesque view of a world of askewed reality.
I:9802;2140;The film, which is so definitely Tim Burton, is also more.
I:9802;2141;It touches on the believable infallability we all have for our fathers as children, and the fall from grace of our fathers when we discover they are as human as we are.
I:9802;2142;though the story provides plenty of whimsy, and at times, plays more like an episode of Amazing stories than anything else, at its core is a powerful story about relationships.
I:9802;2143;This is a bit of a departure from the standard Burton fare, whose narrative stories are generally pure fantasy, without a thread of realism to them.
I:9802;2144;This story is more human than any of those, focusing not on the fantastic, but using the fantastic stories of a father whose life was incredible without the tall tales to explore the psyche of a man who never knew how to fail.
I:9802;2145;in the end, this film is a great tribute to fathers and sons everywhere, and is a film worth sharing.
I:9802;2146;With the approach of Father's Day, this might make for a nice gift to share with Dad, and more, it is an entertaining romp through the fascinating world of Edward Bloom, Burton's newest slightly.
I:9802;2147;"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" spins a yarn about one of the great yarn."
I:9802;2148;spinners of all time, Ed Bloom, and it does so in the enchanting fashion that makes great story.
I:9802;2149;day Bloom (played by the great Albert Finney) is in the twilight of his life, beset by cancer and soon destined to leave this mortal coil.
I:9802;2150;According to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Bloom has filled his life with telling fantastic lies embellished with ridiculous fables enhanced by Bloom's own mythical view of himself.
I:9802;2151;Against his wishes, Will returns home to be with his dad, along with his pregnant wife, during his last days.
I:9802;2152;According to himself, the younger Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor (one of the most likable actors working today), did lead one heck of a fantastic life, replete with witches, giants, werewolves, circus performers, Siamese twins, international intrigue, romances and, of course, a really big fish.
I:9802;2153;Burton invests each of the various episodes in Bloom's past with a wonderful combination of realism and fantasy.
I:9802;2154;this being a Burton film, also beware his trademark black humor.
I:9802;2155;(And what a wonderful comeuppance it is!)
I:9802;2156;But then Will's mom (Jessica Lange) tells Will to start going through all of his father's accumulated personal effects from his long life, and Will starts to see some proof of his father's legendary exploits.
I:9802;2157;And young Will gradually sees the wisdom in his father's penchant for exaggerating his own legends . . . and one of the movie's best moments comes when Will realizes that he's got a bit of Dad's storytelling ability running through his veins.
I:9802;2158;"acted (although one wishes that Jessica Lange had more to do with her role), ""Big Fish"" is sure to enchant viewers who appreciate a good story, and a heart."
I:9802;2159;The pictures and sound are great .
I:9802;2160;One of my husband's favorite movies.
I:9802;2161;Will enjoying watching it with him for a long time.
I:9802;2162;I love Tim Burton movies.
I:9802;2163;He has an amazing imagination, which is lacking in many directors today.
I:9802;2164;Meanwhile Burton's genius is that his beautiful visuals compliment his stories.
I:9802;2165;The majority of the film is told through flashbacks, showing the amazing life that young Edward Bloom (Mcgregor) has lived.
I:9802;2166;From giants to circus, from war to salesman, the film gives you the glimpse of a life as Bloom sees it.
I:9802;2167;the actors in this movie shine.
I:9802;2168;Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are absolutely charming in this movie.
I:9802;2169;You want to believe his stories, and you can see why others do.
I:9802;2170;The convincing shed their accents and pick up a southern accent without you really noticing.
I:9802;2171;Other notable performances include Jessica Lange and Helena Bohnam Carter.
I:9802;2172;She is extremely talented and even with the limited screen time she was given manage to catch my attention.
I:9802;2173;Everyone knows of Tim Burtons visuals.
I:9802;2174;Heck he has made it a trade mark., now known as Burtonism.
I:9802;2175;It was a beautiful town, which represented Heaven on earth.
I:9802;2176;The screenplay by John August captures the beauty of Daniel Wallace's book while expanding on it.
I:9802;2177;Which brings us to the score which was beautifully written by Danny Elfman.
I:9802;2178;I have gotten so used to his dark and moody scores that I forgot how brilliant and light some of his scores can be.
I:9802;2179;This is one of the best, compliments the movie perfectly.
I:9802;2180;This is a movie for everyone.
I:9802;2181;Performances and story are great.
I:9802;2182;What a great film!I hate to say this about a film that I have just seen but I feel I must be honest here: Big Fish was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:9802;2183;The story, acting, romance, humor and visuals are all excellent.
I:9802;2184;Tim Burton has made a truly beautiful film that is warm, intelligent and amusing.
I:9802;2185;Ewan McGregor has really created a wonderful and entertaining character that is really truly endearing to the audience.
I:9802;2186;You really care about what he is doing and what he is going through when he experiences all of his adventures.
I:9802;2187;tim Burton is able to truly create a film for the whole family that isn't sappy or cheesy.
I:9802;2188;He has also created a movie that is very deep and thought.
I:9802;2189;One of my favorites and a must watch for father's and sons.
I:9802;2190;I say luckily because the story is mesmerizing and the fantastic elements are fun and add a certain charisma to the film.
I:9802;2191;As the stories pile up, the son finally starts to understand who his father is and to appreciate that which has bothered him for so long.
I:9802;2192;tim Burton leads us through a labyrinth of myths and legends, with skillful storytelling and scenes that will make even the toughest of you feel emotional and maybe drop a tear or two.
I:9802;2193;It is definitely I movie I recommend everyone to watch!
I:9802;2194;Big Fish is a moving and subversively profound film.
I:9802;2195;others willing to just go with the experience can enjoy the marvelous story telling and affection Tim Burton manages to create.
I:9802;2196;a treasure of a movie, IMO.
I:9802;2197;An old classic from the early 2000's, my wife and I enjoyed it very much and is creative and with an excellent story
I:9802;2198;There are things worth seeing in Tim Burton's Big Fish.
I:9802;2199;Some of the scenes are visually stunning.
I:9802;2200;There are some colorful minor characters (especially the poet/bank robber played by the wonderful Steve Buscemi).
I:9802;2201;And the ending is pretty moving.
I:9802;2202;A delightful diversion from regular films!
I:9802;2203;The screen frequently pops with whimsical exaggerations and candy.
I:9802;2204;tinted flourishes in this imaginative adaptation of Wallace's novel.
I:9802;2205;This movie has a great story and well placed actors.
I:9802;2206;They're all amazing and the fantasy mixed with reality pulls you in.
I:9802;2207;Growing up, Will (Billy Crudup) idealized his father, believing all of his incredible, tall tales of adventure .
I:9802;2208;His sweet smile and positive outlook make him not only an effective salesman of useless household objects, but a salesman of himself and his big fish stories.
I:9802;2209;it's easy to understand Will's resentment .
I:9802;2210;those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart.
I:9802;2211;lots of light hearted moments and tongue.
I:9802;2212;This is a film that you must have in your home because it is just so wonderfully made .
I:9802;2213;it is an experience , a film that opens your eyes as well as your heart.
I:9802;2214;It was loved by the receiver!
I:9802;2215;Big Fish is the best movie of the year.
I:9802;2216;It is full of magic, adventure, comedy, romance, love.
I:9802;2217;Ewan MacGregor's performance is excellent.
I:9802;2218;At present, I think he is the best actor and also the most handsome!
I:9802;2219;If you loved The Princess Bride.you will love this one too!
I:9802;2220;This is a great movie for ANYONE to cherish!
I:9802;2221;Fun, thoughtful and well written and directed.
I:9802;2222;Interesting story but not amazing.
I:9802;2223;Had some good teaching moments for children along the way.
I:9802;2224;There are stories about a young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) having the golden touch in his small hometown and winning at everything.
I:9802;2225;It is very much a father/son relationship movie and it was sweet to see both the father and the son come to some important realizations in the film.
I:9802;2226;Of course, we see Edward Burton's touch mostly in the flashbacks where Ewan McGregor plays Edward Bloom as he has so many amazing adventures and these sequences really added to the film and made it something special instead of commonplace.
I:9802;2227;Like the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in quintissential Burton style, Big Fish weaves together elaborate tales of witches, mystical towns, giants, a circus, conjoined twins and much more into a tale of magical realism.
I:9802;2228;is it important to tell the truth, or can beautifully told stories become part of a person's character and life as much as the actual events in their life?
I:9802;2229;however the film is certainly worth watching.
I:9802;2230;not least for the beautifully crafted cinematography, evocative backgrounds painting a magical, traditional small town American scenes and the subtle, bittersweet score.
I:9802;2231;big Fish is very fun to watch (also filled with lots of meaning), and it is even filled with some hilarious moments.
I:9802;2232;so uummmm.5 stars from me.
I:9802;2233;and I think this is a great movie for anybody of any age.
I:9802;2234;It's a classic much like Forrest Gump.
I:9802;2235;So Much symbolism, depth, and meaning.
I:9802;2236;The plot device of using the fantastictales of the father to illustrate the son's frustration with his father is well done.
I:9802;2237;I have a personal dislike for the use of freakish characters such as giants but this was actually well carried out with a Fellini.
I:9802;2238;Overall a good film that provides a heart.
I:9802;2239;This story is very good, what else would you expect from a Burton/Elfman combo?
I:9802;2240;Will since dismissed everything his father ever told him about himself and went on to live his very practical and clean.
I:9802;2241;This film is about the way a man's imagination can shape and define his life.
I:9802;2242;What Will learns throughout the course of the film is that the man is the stories he told.
I:9802;2243;Edward adds color to the story because it means something to him, and the metaphor of the Big Fish is self.
I:9802;2244;A scene toward the end of the movie involving Finney, Lange and a bathtub is one of the most touching in recent memory.
I:9802;2245;from amid all of the family strife and sadness surrounding the father's illness emerges a wondrous celebration of the human imagination and how it can make any moment special.
I:9802;2246;Truly a film for the ages.
I:9802;2247;This tale features just such a protagonist and a son determined to get to the truth.
I:9802;2248;secondly, do you like to both laugh and cry in films?
I:9802;2249;This film will do both to most of you.
I:9802;2250;thirdly, do you enjoy tales that are a bit over the top?
I:9802;2251;There is a depth about it, an allegorical feel that is somewhat transformational.
I:9802;2252;The acting is good, not surprising if you read the list of actors in it.
I:9802;2253;all in all, I love this film and I hope you will too.
I:9802;2254;i saw this in the theatre with a friend and we had a good laugh.
I:9802;2255;we also cried and hurled, but i'll save that story for another review.
I:9802;2256;Went with eager anticipation to see this one.
I:9802;2257;Interesting premise, amazing visuals but way too drawn out.
I:9802;2258;This is a good movie.
I:9802;2259;I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone.
I:9802;2260;Kids will enjoy this flick too!
I:9802;2261;Going back and forth in time, director Tim Burton takes a dip into the realms of realism and fairy tales revealing the life of a man who never wanted to be a big fish in a little pond.
I:9802;2262;Edward's penchant for adventure takes him from his small hometown in the deep South, around the world, and then back again.
I:9802;2263;Along the way he meets a witch with a magical glass eye, a hungry giant, jumping spiders, conjoined twins, a playful werewolf, and many more characters, including his future wife.
I:9802;2264;Animal lovers are privy to an unprecedented big top act of acrobatics combining the talents of lions, bears, elephants, ponies, pigs, dogs, and a death.
I:9802;2265;defying housecat who ascends nearly 30 feet in the air on a platform and leaps, landing perfectly on.
I:9802;2266;If you take The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and crossed it with Forest Gump, then you'll get a good idea of what Big Fish is like.
I:9802;2267;Tim Burton has always had a knack for taking bizarre subject matter and making a heartwarming movie out of it(like Edward Scissorhands).
I:9802;2268;Burton has certainly redeemed himself here after that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations!
I:9802;2269;It's a whimsical, bizarre, funny fantasy with just the right amount of sappiness thrown in.
I:9802;2270;Pretty well balanced if you ask me.
I:9802;2271;That's small potatoes coz his humor and style do still shine through.
I:9802;2272;I really hate to use this lame cliche, but this is a very good film for children and adults alike, though the adults are gonna get alot more out of it.
I:9802;2273;Previews were absolutely terrific and appeared to be something I would watch on more than one occasion.
I:9802;2274;A great movie with a good story line to it.
I:9802;2275;Most of all, it is entertaining.
I:9802;2276;This film shows the importance of story telling and the importance of the desire in each of us to live bigger then we are.
I:9802;2277;Filed with funny moments, heartfelt sequences, and fantastical sequences, Big Fish is a great film for date night, when you are home alone, or when you want to be dazzled and reminded of an overlooked aspect of life.
I:9802;2278;the grandness of our existence in a world filled with amazing people and circumstances.
I:9802;2279;This is the best movie for the last 10 years.
I:9802;2280;It has a lot of meaning on each scene.
I:9802;2281;This was a very strange and very tall tale that incorporates a sweet and subtle reminder to cherish the one(s) you love.
I:9802;2282;Good for some laughs, and some very unique story.
I:9802;2283;A rather entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
I:9802;2284;This is a gem worth seeing.
I:9802;2285;this was a very sweet story of father and son.
I:9802;2286;the stories the father told maybe have been like a fairly tale but this movie touch my heart.
I:9802;2287;the bath tub edward scene with his wife touched me a lot.
I:9802;2288;like i said this is just a sweet story.
I:9802;2289;Every man's life is a fairy tale.
I:9802;2290;Everyone you love is sacred.
I:9802;2291;Every person who loves you is a gift.
I:9802;2292;Big Fish wants to be so much bigger and better than it is.
I:9802;2293;oddly, the comparison that leaps to mind is Road to Perdition, Alan Ball's well.
I:9802;2294;intentioned and beautifully crafted movie that suffers from too much telling and not enough story.
I:9802;2295;carter all turn in fine performances, though McGregor's is the only role with any real substance).
I:9802;2296;And both Perdition and Fish boast beautifully crafted visuals ( Perdition owing to the legendary Conrad Hall, Fish presumably to the mind of Burton himself and the team he works with).
I:9802;2297;For all their emptiness, both movies are candy to the eyes.
I:9802;2298;make no mistake, there are scenes of breathtaking beauty in this film.
I:9802;2299;The moment when Ewan McGregor spies his future wife is magnificent.
I:9802;2300;Another comes when Finney and Lange share a fully.
I:9802;2301;clothed moment in a tub together, one of the few moments of truly raw emotion in the movie.
I:9802;2302;burton's talents as a filmmaker are undeniable .
I:9802;2303;and considering his other works, which dive heavily into fantasy, this first attempt at a new style is admirably deft and well.
I:9802;2304;crafted (though certainly it contains fantastical elements).
I:9802;2305;Likely a great story worth reading (if available in a book?)
I:9802;2306;A man tells his stories so many times, that he becomes the stories.
I:9802;2307;This film is about the exploits, real or imagined, of Ed Bloom, a fascinating, larger.
I:9802;2308;life character who is loved by all.
I:9802;2309;He has the uncanny ability to suspend disbelief in favor of wonder every time he tells a story.
I:9802;2310;And these stories, loaded with imagination and wit, are animated by wonderful performances by an exemplary cast that engender their characters with life, rendering them almost believable.
I:9802;2311;"Since the stories bring so much joy to the listener, and to us as viewers, they are much more satisfying to accept at face value
I:9802;2312;In THE BIG FISH Tim Burton has created a masterpiece of fantasy that is firmly grounded in human relations, especially the complex relationship between a father and a son and the understated emotional bond between a husband and a wife.
I:9802;2313;A truly exquisite masterpiece from the genius of Tim Burton.
I:9802;2314;Beautifully crafted, superbly acted and leaviung an audience with tears of joy.
I:9802;2315;Finney as always is perfect in the role of the older man.
I:9802;2316;This is a charming film that offers laughs and tears.
I:9802;2317;The characters are easy to sympathize with and offer some outrageous situations which should be expected in a film about tall tales.
I:9802;2318;But this story is gentle and really about a son learning to love his father and appreciate him.
I:9802;2319;this is not what I would call a 'chick flick', guys should enjoy this film equally.
I:9802;2320;Being a huge admirer of Tim Burton's work, I eagerly anticipated seeing Big Fish.
I:9802;2321;I was also expecting something more colorful and visually stunning.
I:9802;2322;This is exactly why I go see movies.
I:9802;2323;This is one movie that I enjoy watching so much that I willingly go along with the bigger than life stories that are so sweet, comical, and beautiful.
I:9802;2324;I love new fairytale story lines and this one is perfect.
I:9802;2325;It makes you explore your own reality for hints of true magic.
I:9802;2326;This is a delightful movie.
I:9802;2327;i love albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.
I:9802;2328;I wasnt sure where the story line was going atfirst but what a delight this movie was.
I:9802;2329;I will add this to one of myclassic movies.
I:9802;2330;The love of a father and son.
I:9802;2331;The struggles and growth of a realisticrelationship.
I:9802;2332;Whole family loved it, ages 84.13.
I:9802;2333;Not just a chick flick, the guys really enjoyed it too.
I:9802;2334;What a sweet little picture.
I:9802;2335;I found albert finney to be as charismatic as ever.
I:9802;2336;Ewan McGregor, was a bit type cast, but he's good at playing the perfect guy.
I:9802;2337;He allows his imagination to grace the screen but unlike things like Kill Bill it never distracts from the over all experience.
I:9802;2338;the stories, this is the meat of the movie.
I:9802;2339;They are hauntingly surreal and are as intriguing to watch as they must have been to hear.
I:9802;2340;I won't ruin stories themselves but they were a complete delight to behold.
I:9802;2341;I smell a best song oscar for Eddie Vedder and crew.
I:9802;2342;It's a bit over sweet, so it depends on what kind of mood your in.
I:9802;2343;I for one got hooked and reeled in by the very big heart of this very big fish.
I:9802;2344;"while ""Big Fish"" is on the surface a film about a father in his dying days narrating the incredible and zany stories of his life and a son who tries to find out if these stories have any truth in them and simoultaneously learn who his father really was before he dies, there's quite many underlying and very significant questions and issues that this film deals with."
I:9802;2345;Big Fish walks , in my opinion, a very tight rope, and having to maintain a very precarious balance it does incredibly well.
I:9802;2346;the rest of the cast is up to par as well.
I:9802;2347;Father Gloom played by Finney is a wonderful zesty character, as well as his wife played by a graciously aging J. lange.
I:9802;2348;De Vito and Buscemi, even in second leads, remind us easily why they belong to that league of premier actors.
I:9802;2349;I love the heart, imagination and creativity that went into this movie.
I:9802;2350;A wonderful movie about life!
I:9802;2351;Burton's brilliant film Big Fish is a clever and entertaining.
I:9802;2352;More importantly, it manages to invoke real emotions as the audience connects with the multi.
I:9802;2353;dimensional and true portrayals of the characters on screen.
I:9802;2354;I liked this movie a lot.
I:9802;2355;True to the book, but smartly changed when it served the visual medium of film.
I:9802;2356;however, I loved the relationship between Edward and Sandra Bloom .
I:9802;2357;The simplicity of their love and complete acceptance of the other was touching.
I:9802;2358;I thought William struck exactly the right tone, trying to come to terms with his father before the latter's death.
I:9802;2359;All in all, the movie was an interesting juxtaposition of 'real life' and fantasy.
I:9802;2360;"His superb visual sense, bizarre sense of humor and unique vision have resulted in such personal favorites as ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood"" and the more mainstream but beautifully excuted ""Sleepy Hollow."""
I:9802;2361;Oh yeah, and he did right by Pee.
I:9802;2362;"I came to ""Big Fish"" wanting to love it, encouraged by excellent."
I:9802;2363;The finale, which aspires to be tear.
I:9802;2364;"ironically, the bigger a Burton fan you are, the less you are likely to enjoy ""Big Fish,"" while those turned off by Burton's eccentricities will probably relate to the superficialities of this film."
I:9802;2365;I absolutely love this movie!!!
I:9802;2366;They're love is almost strong then the couple in this movie!
I:9802;2367;This has been one of my favorites from the first time I watched it.
I:9802;2368;esque, colorful, funny, and well.
I:9802;2369;It moves quickly and keeps you entertained from start to finish.
I:9802;2370;This was one of my Christmas presents to myself, and it's definitely one I won't regret!
I:9802;2371;This movie is one of Tim Burton's best films so far!
I:9802;2372;I love Tim Burton's films .
I:9802;2373;the acting, the musical score (Danny Elfman), the stories are magical and fabulous, and the visuals are spectacular!
I:9802;2374;He makes magic happen with every film!
I:9802;2375;The first time around was appealing, a good, likable movie.
I:9802;2376;The second time around was satisfying.
I:9802;2377;I caught all the minor details, and was pretty good.
I:9802;2378;It is a good piece.
I:9802;2379;The beauty created by the visual and special effects in the movie were perfected brilliantly, but the plot of the story is average.
I:9802;2380;good movie, good story, it takes a bit to get into but great once you sit down for it.
I:9802;2381;Bumbera brings up really good points, and his analysis is thorough.
I:9802;2382;What Burton has done with this film is visionary and new.
I:9802;2383;leveled manner using a variety of dimensions available in film.
I:9802;2384;He takes you through Ed Bloom's unbelievable stories in a world that looks very similar to our own.
I:9802;2385;Was the old Ed Bloom ever like his very endearing younger self?
I:9802;2386;Was this man simply an egomaniac?Your one ambassador in this mind.
I:9802;2387;bending investigation is Ed Bloom's son, Will Bloom, because he is the rational mind trying to separate fact from fiction.
I:9802;2388;As you and the son investigate the facts behind the story, you find that you tire of the son and his investigations.
I:9802;2389;personally, I became a committed fan of the film when the son, Will Burton, is interviewing Jessica Hill.
I:9802;2390;Both her character and story are well.
I:9802;2391;"I loved the dimensions she adds to what ""makes sense""."
I:9802;2392;"The wonderful imagination of Tim Burton strikes again here, in his father and son story of ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;2393;This movie is the incredible life of Edward Bloom, a grand storyteller whose life has remained a mystery because nobody can seperate the fact from the fiction.
I:9802;2394;He brings his pregnant wife Josephine with him, and he will speak with his father in the first time in years.
I:9802;2395;"The goal of Will, played excellently by Billy Crudup (one of the most underrated actors out there, see ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jesus' Son"") is to sort out who is father really is."
I:9802;2396;Both actors take the tall tales and run with them, and both of them come away with very strong performances.
I:9802;2397;Big Fish is the story of leading a huge life, even when it may have been duller than expected.
I:9802;2398;the direction here is top.
I:9802;2399;notch, as Burton stuns again with his creative vision.
I:9802;2400;ahead drama, as well as the incredible tales of Edward Bloom, which are visually stunning as well as compelling.
I:9802;2401;All the actors here are good, including Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Danny DeVito and Steve Buschemi.
I:9802;2402;entertaining, fabulous, a marriage of Daniel Wallace's fantastic mind and Tim Burton's incredible vision.
I:9802;2403;I really liked this movie, and despite its emotional ending I was somewhat disappointed to find out that the man was a liar all along.
I:9802;2404;Okay, the few final scenes may be open to interpretation, but I still say the guy's a liar.
I:9802;2405;but the more I thought about it, the more I thought that we all have tall tales to tell about ourselves.
I:9802;2406;the music in the film is perfect.
I:9802;2407;big Fish may not have the originality of The Neverending Story, but it certainly has a lot of charm.
I:9802;2408;The Alabama setting adds a lot to the atmosphere.
I:9802;2409;The title fits in perfectly with the symbolism and themes.
I:9802;2410;This product arrived quick and was packaged well to protect it.
I:9802;2411;this movie is one awsome movie.
I:9802;2412;I give it 5 stars and I think that everyone should give it a watch at least one time in their life.
I:9802;2413;This movie has it all!
I:9802;2414;It has humor, fantasy, and an overall outstanding story!
I:9802;2415;"Ewan McGregor plays a fabulous Edward Bloom, an eccentric young man on a journey to find a ""bigger pond."""
I:9802;2416;Tim Burton delivers a wonderful and touching story in this film about a dying man with a son who won't accept him as he is.
I:9802;2417;The movie takes you on the twists and turns through Edward Bloom's life as his son tries to discover who his father is.
I:9802;2418;The cast is great and the story is phenomenal creating an exceptional film!
I:9802;2419;good, fantasy movie, with just a touch of darkness.
I:9802;2420;Great characters, actors, and story.
I:9802;2421;He has done so much, seen so many things, that he has many stories to tell.
I:9802;2422;Now that his father is nearing the end of his life, William takes it upon himself to determine who his father actually was, what he actually did, and how he actually led his life.
I:9802;2423;What William finds forces him to rethink his preconceptions about his father.
I:9802;2424;big Fish is a wonderful story.
I:9802;2425;"Chock full of color, beautiful imagery and metaphor, this movie, primarily examines the relationship between a father and son
I:9802;2426;tim Burton has crafted yet another amazing story.
I:9802;2427;Big Fish may not contain the graphic wizardry of A Nightmare Before Christmas (though there are some nifty special effects scenes) and may not be quite as haunting as Edward Scissorhands, but Big Fish stands alone as a tale that shows superbly the power that stories can have, and how they can change lives.
I:9802;2428;I just saw this movie and I can only say that Tim Burton is the greatest story teller that exists today in the modern movie industry (together with Spielberg that is).
I:9802;2429;It's a romantic, nostalgic commedy that combines the softness of Forest Gump with the travels of Baron Von Minhaouzen, making a movie that comes out of the heart of its creator.
I:9802;2430;If you see this film for no other reason, watch it for the dazzling cinematography.
I:9802;2431;You can't help but be swept up into this magical world and wondering how such a fantasy could possibly be real.
I:9802;2432;If you enjoyed The Princess Bride, Secondhand Lions, The Wizard of Oz, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory you are sure to enjoy Big Fish.
I:9802;2433;"As much as I love Tim Burton's films, the one that stands alone is ""Big Fish""."
I:9802;2434;To me, this is his best work.
I:9802;2435;good film, the ultimate fairy tale.
I:9802;2436;Scenes of extraordinary characters and storytelling is what makes the film so wonderful.
I:9802;2437;Through all of it's craziness, the main theme I believe is love.
I:9802;2438;Finney's wife is played by Jessica Lange, who is fantastic as well.
I:9802;2439;The supporting cast helps make the film so powerful too, with a big highlight going out to Danny DeVito, who as usual, gives a strong performance.
I:9802;2440;This will alaways be on my top five favorite films, and will make you laugh and move you.
I:9802;2441;Big Fish is a creative story about a father and son who have broken apart after three years, and only the father's (played brilliantly by Alber Finney) failing life bring them together.
I:9802;2442;But through his father's stories, the son eventually comes to understand who his father really is, and who he always has been.
I:9802;2443;Ewan McGreggor playes the father in his younger years brilliantly.
I:9802;2444;this is truly Tim Burton's masterpiece.
I:9802;2445;It still retains some of the darkness one would expect with one of his other films, but it is a film that captures the stories of people's lives, no matter how exaggerated they may be.
I:9802;2446;Bought this movie for my boyfriend since it's his favorite and I liked it!
I:9802;2447;big Fish is a wonderful movie written and directed by Tim Burton.
I:9802;2448;Being a Tim Burton movie you expect a dark and gloomy type of filming and story that brings your interest into the main characters but yet keeps you on the edge while waiting to see the strange sides of darkness that he can expose is characters and in his movies.
I:9802;2449;But though Tim Burton seems to have a mastery of the dark film, it is amazing to see a man show how wonderful and bright life can be.
I:9802;2450;the story itself is a Great inspiration of how one mans life can affect so many others, and also shows that redemption can never come too late as the Son and Father come to a place of respect and love in the end of the movie.
I:9802;2451;"But what amazes me the most about this movie is how even though you can classify it as a ""feel good"" movie, it goes so far beyond that."
I:9802;2452;It's a movie that sticks with you and seemly coveys a message that you take home, it gives you a feeling of hope.
I:9802;2453;Just watch this movie and see how good you feel and how it is not cheesy conveyed emotions or over the top acting, just total stability where these actors convey a marvelous story in a real to life way.
I:9802;2454;the special affects are amazing and what is great about them is that they are only used to make a point or to tell the tall tales his Father tells him, and you continue to look forward to every little story he will tell in the movie so you can see a great little imagination play out on the screen in a larger than life way.
I:9802;2455;i highly recommend this movie, I was a fool to say I'd never see it because Tim Burton made it.
I:9802;2456;I am amazed a guy who seems to be so skilled with eerie and dark movies can find such a way to embrace life and show the good in everyday people while making you feel wonderful and inspired all at once.
I:9802;2457;This ranks right up next to Shawshank Redemption as one of the greatest overlooked movie of the past 10 years.
I:9802;2458;"The most common review of BIG FISH from friends who viewed the film was something along the lines of ""I am surprised I liked it as much as I did."""
I:9802;2459;In BIG FISH, the latter is the case and creativity is the key that makes the movie interesting.
I:9802;2460;In resolving the conflict, the son begins to gradually understand and appreciate the father, and this happens in a natural manner.
I:9802;2461;Ewan McGreggor, and Albert Finney are masterful as the young and older Ed Bloom.
I:9802;2462;Billy Crudup is a compelling and believable Will Bloom.
I:9802;2463;Jessica Lange, Robert Guillaume, Danny De Vito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alison Lohman also star in the film as supporting cast and do admirably.
I:9802;2464;The fanciful tales of the movie are glitzy and create a magical atmosphere.
I:9802;2465;The mini stories within the larger story are also in keeping with the character of Ed Bloom.
I:9802;2466;Director Tim Burton has reason to be pleased with much of the film.
I:9802;2467;As interesting as the sub.
I:9802;2468;Tim Burton is a master of movies that blur genre lines.
I:9802;2469;Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were action.
I:9802;2470;superhero movies with a twist of black humor provided by Nicholson's Joker and DeVito's Penguin, respectively.
I:9802;2471;Big Fish contains elements of tragedy, comedy, adventure, fantasy, and drama, and mixes them up into a delightful and sensitive tall tale unlike any of Burton's other works.
I:9802;2472;the casting is immaculate: Ewan McGregor makes a great younger version of Albert Finney, and Allison Lohman is a dead ringer for a young Jessica Lange.
I:9802;2473;although the story is a bit uneven at times, spending a few moments too long in the fantastical reconstructions of Finney's youth, the stories are so worthwhile and entertaining that the viewer is willing to overlook this shortcoming.
I:9802;2474;The movie also runs a bit long at just over two hours, but the final scenes tie the movie together neatly and give the viewer a sense of completeness and satisfaction with the outcome.
I:9802;2475;the primary theme of the film is the stories that we tell and how they affect other people's lives, a topic in which I have long had a casual interest.
I:9802;2476;viewed with a less critical eye, the movie is still very entertaining and the sort of wildly imaginative story to which only Burton could do justice.
I:9802;2477;Probably the best film I've seen since The Passion of the Christ.
I:9802;2478;One as you see it, a hundred more as others see it.
I:9802;2479;That is until the voice over came on with the proclomation that the father was in fact the stories he had always loved so much to tell, and that he relived them and thus became immortal.
I:9802;2480;I'm just going to say that this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:9802;2481;There I was at blockbuster and this movie was on sale, you know one of those two for twenty dollars specials and my kids wanted it because they 'heard' it was good.
I:9802;2482;I am not a big fish so you will have to watch the movie for yourself and see what you find, five stars on this one for me!
I:9802;2483;Just a good movie all around.
I:9802;2484;Great film that emphasizes the truth behind a story.
I:9802;2485;The relationship between father and son snags a poignant tone that will resonate with a viewer's past experiences.
I:9802;2486;Tim Burton is a genius and I applaud this film to show that fables, tales and stories told in rural parts of America can have real meaning in the end.
I:9802;2487;The cinematography, art direction, acting and casting are superb.
I:9802;2488;He was also from the south, like Mr. Bloom in the film.
I:9802;2489;I still feel the effects of the tales he told me as a boy and the pain it caused me and my family as we grew wiser and learned the truth.
I:9802;2490;It is worth watching this movie with families.
I:9802;2491;So where does this leave us and is it really important to know?
I:9802;2492;Especially believable is the strained relationship between father and son.
I:9802;2493;but then takes you to a journey that ends with you, the viewer, just like the son, falling in love with Edward Bloom's character and storytelling in general.
I:9802;2494;well then let it be.
I:9802;2495;Live with all your might and love with all your might.
I:9802;2496;Live it to the full.
I:9802;2497;the film is best regarded as a lovely fantasy tale with many bizarre creatures that people of all ages can enjoy.
I:9802;2498;My young sons, watching the movie with me, loved the witch, the giant and the twins.
I:9802;2499;and then learning to accept it as it is.
I:9802;2500;actually, the stories he told were all based on truth.
I:9802;2501;The strength of Big Fish is its visual flair, and the director is Tim Burton.
I:9802;2502;The picture is filled with his imagination, which is greatly helped by the able cast including, besides McGregor and Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman as Edward's love Sandra, and Danny Devito.
I:9802;2503;again I say the visual is great because the stories Edward tells us tend to be repetitive, and its contents are not always interesting, or 'big' enough.
I:9802;2504;Some episodes are not necessary while some look mercilessly shortened, especially the one about the girl 'Jenny' who is incredibly cute.
I:9802;2505;still, the film is moving when it concentrate on its theme .
I:9802;2506;very odd, but in a Good Way.
I:9802;2507;It's not the Yellow Brick Road, but it *is* a fun journey toward Father and Son Reunion, with a wonderous cast along the Way.
I:9802;2508;BIG FISH is a film about living a life full of worth.
I:9802;2509;We should always live our lives with a childlike faith, always curious, always wanting to explore.
I:9802;2510;BIG FISH is also a film that raises some interesting questions.
I:9802;2511;the movie briefly tells the story of one Edward Bloom, a life.
I:9802;2512;ewan McGregor plays the younger version of Bloom and his performance is what holds the film together as it weaves from the past to the present and from fantasy and reality.
I:9802;2513;Also, Danny DeVito makes an impressive turn in an interesting supporting role as a circus ringmaster with a strange disease.
I:9802;2514;the movie was directed by Tim Burton and it's nice to see Burton getting back to movies he enjoys making.
I:9802;2515;overall, BIG FISH is a fun film to watch.
I:9802;2516;It's full of beautiful subtleties.
I:9802;2517;It has a good message and though is fantastical, seems more down.
I:9802;2518;The film is a decent family movie though younger children probably won't enjoy it as much as older ones.
I:9802;2519;It had spectacular imagery and the acting was wonderful, but story.
I:9802;2520;I definitely liked the 'stories' parts of the film more enjoyable than the present times scenes.
I:9802;2521;The son, well, he needs years of therapy.
I:9802;2522;Well, at least at the end, he got it .
I:9802;2523;Excellent movie which has all the right ingredients: beauty, fun, magic, a good story, interesting characters played by wonderful actors,.
I:9802;2524;This is an amazing adult fairy tale filmed by the ever impressive imagination of Tim Burton with several great messages contained within the disguise of an old man's dreams.
I:9802;2525;But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it.
I:9802;2526;this is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication.
I:9802;2527;With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well.
I:9802;2528;This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability.
I:9802;2529;At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace.
I:9802;2530;For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments this movie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping.
I:9802;2531;It has a little bit of everything in it and just a good ole feel good flick.
I:9802;2532;Big Fish is an exquisite meal of voluminous substance that will give you much to chew on for some time.
I:9802;2533;All that is served to you, the characters, settings, visualizations, music, the stories within the story have been prepared as if from the finest chefs and set down in front of you with the beauty of a fine tapestry.
I:9802;2534;Jackson's accomplishments were truly spectacular.
I:9802;2535;good special effects and good acting, but the story kind of held everything back.
I:9802;2536;Tim Burton outdoes his past efforts in this adaptation of the book.
I:9802;2537;The imagery is amazing and you get lost in this tale of love, life and redemption.
I:9802;2538;Ewan MacGregor, Jessica Lange and Albert Finney each give a wonderful performance as your disbelief is suspended and the tall tales run rampant.
I:9802;2539;A must see and a must own.
I:9802;2540;Great Movie, received in timely manner.
I:9802;2541;this is an amazing movie.
I:9802;2542;the story is captivating, characters and plot are fun,.
I:9802;2543;Everything in this movie had a positive constant flow.
I:9802;2544;Strong Story, Music to match the mood, everything was perfect.
I:9802;2545;at least it was great from what the wife and kids told me.
I:9802;2546;they all seemed to love it and want to watch it again sometime.
I:9802;2547;I thought the resulting release was a sweet story, somewhat like a whimsical, extended episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
I:9802;2548;Bloom's son drew a sharp line between fact and fable, and between him and his father.
I:9802;2549;most of the film is Edward's version, filled with prophecy, a modern.
I:9802;2550;day Brigadoon, giants, circuses, and above all the untamed river spirit.
I:9802;2551;bloom's wife is a wonderful character, and should have gotten a lot more attention.
I:9802;2552;She was completely dedicated to Bloom, tolerated his tall tales and even loved him for them.
I:9802;2553;In the end, the son joins in Bloom's world beyond reality, while Bloom is still alive to welcome him there.
I:9802;2554;day fairy tale, it would look like this.
I:9802;2555;the gentle action and family feeling make this mostly a chick flick.
I:9802;2556;flick side of it is worth five, though, and I know not to argue: four stars over all.
I:9802;2557;This is a good movie but could be a masterpiese if :1.
I:9802;2558;I watched on the Kindle Fire while lying in bed one night, good story and well done I thought.
I:9802;2559;It has a great cast and was well acted and I will watch again.
I:9802;2560;Lots of reviews that I had read said it was good for the first 15 minutes and then went in a downward spiral from there.
I:9802;2561;flick movie about a son remembering storys that his dieing father had told him as a little boy, and then the rest of the movie sped up into a supernatural story of a man's life.
I:9802;2562;Through the father's adventures, he befriended giants, joined the circus, fought in WWII in Japan and met up with a pair of Siamese Twins, found a perfect town, and then saved it, got married, caught a really big fish on the day his son was born and then let it go, and saw the way he would did in the glass eye of a witch.
I:9802;2563;"After the son was done with the story, his fathers last words were ""Exactly!"""
I:9802;2564;At the funeral, you got to see all of the people from the fathers stories, and as a suprising truth to the son that it wasn't all made up.
I:9802;2565;the moral of the story: Sometimes telling a exgerated lie based on the truth is much better than hearing the truth itself.
I:9802;2566;As the son found out, his father's version of how things happened was much more exciting and entertaining than the way they happened in reality.
I:9802;2567;the movie had great special effects of the weird and supernatural too.
I:9802;2568;The Siamese Twins were great and of course, the big fish in the movie was very realistic.
I:9802;2569;rosebud) on his death bed, I found it very alike.
I:9802;2570;I don't know if this one was purposeful, but the fathers wedding ring reminded me of the ring from Lord of the Rings.
I:9802;2571;overall, this is a great movie.
I:9802;2572;I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it to those who like uplifting and a beautifully written story.
I:9802;2573;The actors, story line, and settings were well worth the watch.
I:9802;2574;This one deserves multiple viewings!
I:9802;2575;Very interesting take on tall tales.
I:9802;2576;Ewan McGregor and Jessica Lange do an excellent job.
I:9802;2577;The story was moving and fast paced.
I:9802;2578;You know it is great, but you just can't quite put a solid explanation pulling together all the reasons why.
I:9802;2579;Big Fish is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch.
I:9802;2580;It will particular touch fathers and sons (as that is the backbone of the story), but there is something for everyone to enjoy.
I:9802;2581;This is just a solid movie featuring top.
I:9802;2582;notch storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor.
I:9802;2583;Good story, great cinematography and fun for the family.
I:9802;2584;This is a good clean movie with a great ending.
I:9802;2585;Supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son.
I:9802;2586;True, this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but nevertheless it is a sweet story, and makes you think about yourself and other people in your life, as it is also a true classic motion picture event.
I:9802;2587;The acting is absolutely superb as it is always the case with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor does a great job too.
I:9802;2588;The scenery is beautiful and the photography is exceptional, and sure you will find some of Tim Burton's trademark shocking or even somewhat scary moments, but always the humorous relief.
