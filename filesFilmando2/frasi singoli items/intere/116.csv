id;spiegazione
1;This is one of my all time favorite films.
2;There's romance, violence, humor, twists and excellent acting performances by Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.
3;It has some great heavy hitters with small parts but absolutely stunning performances.
4;I was completely surprised how good of a movie this was.
5;There are so many good acters playing minor charater roles and they do them each so well.
6;First is Drexel the white pimp who thinks he's a black guy played by Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson has a minor role in this film with Drexel so you have to watch to catch him.
7;Dennis Hopper is great as Clearence's dad.
8;as one of of Walken's henchmen is James Gandolfini who gets in a great fight with Alabama played by Patrica Arquette and they rip each other apart.
9;It pretty violent but it's kinda funny too watching this little girl take on this huge guy.
10;Brad Pitt is great as Floyd the stoner who only leaves the couch once during the whole movie.
11;all the characters come together in as the movie flows.
12;The love story part is good too because it is not overdone.
13;They have some pretty good stories.
14;the extra film clips and the featurette on the making of the movie are pretty good.
15;The deleted scenes are pretty much an extension of the regular scenes but you do get to see Jack Black.
16;True Romance is a very good film, but it did not recieve the acclaim it should have (and eventually did) when it premiered in 1993.
17;Tony Scott (Top Gun, Revenge) directs this film, as mostly all of his films, with a lot of face.
18;But here he shows his passion for it's story and especially the main characters of Clarence and Alabama as he follows them on their romantic and dangerous journey together.
19;clarence and Alabama are portrayed by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, who make an excellent couple in this film.
20;Clarence is a lonely comic book store clerk who meets Alabama, a free.
21;All of these supporting performances are great and work very well with Tarantino's unique dialogue with the exception of Brad Pitt as Floyd, Dick's stoner roommate.
22;Pitt (early in his career) adds a lot more to this 'cameo' character than Tarantino's script, and he does it very well.
23;Clarence and Alabama are two people deeply in love who walk into a dangerous oppportunity and they take it together.
24;True Romance is funny, dark, intense, romantic, and it's done well.
25;Unlike many director and writer commentaries, Tarantino's commentary is interesting and entertaining making you feel like he is your friend watching the film with you.
26;On the second disc is an enjoyable selected commentary given by actor Michael Rappaport who offers a lot of behind.
27;scenes info on his scenes, and he is genuinely funny on this commentary too.
28;Also included on the second disc is the original ending from Tarantino's script.
29;It is a very good movie.
30;This has always benn one of my all time faves.
31;Wild, zany, violent , romantic, and comical.
32;the love between Claernce and his Alabama is so stronge the it is fate that they should be together.
33;my only advise is watch this film and you will realise what true romance is ,and if not for that Brad Pitt's in it girls what more reason to watch a film???
34;"I loved Pulp Fiction, I liked Reservoir Dogs
35;This is the best love/action movie ever made.
36;The fight sceens are great and reallistic, kinda makes you feel that there is hope for everyone out there to find love.
37;Movie most have not seen, has a remarkable cast and a great story.
38;Impressive cast and great dialog make for an unforgettable film which I enjoy time and time again.
39;Definitely a must see for Quentin Tarantino fans.
40;This movie is pretty good.
41;It has a lot of bloodshed and a new use for an old corkscrew.
42;Oh boy, Quentin really did well with this movie.
43;It is truly a fast movie with this couple taking on one bizarre situation after another as they handle with the resources at hand.
44;a real good movie from beginning to end.
45;it has lots of action and suspense.
46;it was well worth the money.
47;i received in a timely fashion and in good shape.
48;i am well pleased with the movie and service i received.
49;Just as good as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction!
50;If you liked either of those movies you will like True Romance.
51;Very awesome 90's movie in the vein of pulp fiction.
52;Definitely worth a watch for the Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene alone.
53;Bought it for the special features.
54;I bought this movie for my roommate for Christmas and she loves it!
55;It's a classic and a great movie to watch!
56;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!
57;I can watch certain scenes over and over.
58;The chemistry between Patricia and Christian is some of the best chemistry between two actors I've seen on the big screen (as it always is when two stars actually date.
59;One of the best cast films of all time.
60;This special rated version is dope.
61;Christian and Patricia's commentary is funny as hell.
62;And there are A LOT of great other special features.
63;He made about 900 drawn frames, shot to shot of the movie.
64;I learned a lot about the movie and filmmaking in general.
65;I just hope that Christian and Tarantino can work together again.
66;He's got his kids and wife to make it happen.
67;Christian Slater is one of the sexiest men on the screen of all time.
68;The man literally takes my breath away everytime he is on screen.
69;Much love in your direction man, life is hard what can I say?
70;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
71;The plot and cast is amazing.
72;If you took `Get Shorty', fused it with `Wild at Heart' and had Quentin Tarantino direct it, you'd have `True Romance'.
73;Maybe that's why this is Scott's finest film (at least from what I've seen), but either way this is one of those cult classics that deserves the status it has attained.
74;pop culture references, black comedic timing, dire dramatic intensity, brutal violence and fantastical influxes coat this film and help create a unique and engaging atmosphere that thrives with every passing frame.
75;telling the story of loner Clarence who hooks up with Alabama Whitman, a hooker with a heart of gold, `True Romance' takes us on a modern day Bonnie and Clyde type adventure.
76;Seriously, from the two leads (Slater and Arquette are fantastic) to the ridiculously cluttered ensemble, everyone is at the top of their game.
77;From the rich soundtrack to the bounty of colors and passionate performances, `True Romance' is as real as it gets and one of those magical films that defines what cinema is all about.
78;Perhaps the best cast ever assembled for a movie.
79;It IS conveying the ultimate romance!
80;Sacrafice, courage, and the fight for whats good!
81;Watch it, then watch it again.
82;Well written, great cast, superb performances and can be watched and enjoyed the same way over the years.
83;This film was directed by Tony Scott the director of such great films as """"Top Gun"""" and man oh man he did an amazing job with this work of art."""
84;There are two cameos of many that stand out in this picture and are so brilliant.
85;The first is made by Christopher Walken, the character is only in one scene of the film along side Dennis Hopper and it's probably one of the highest quoted and most brilliantly filmed scenes in the film.
86;Patricia Arquette really knocked this one out of the park, even though I'm not really a fan of most of her films she really shows her chops with this wonderful character, I even really loved her short voice over in the beginning and ending of the film just an amazing job.
87;com page for the picture and all of the actors listed just hit every mark and were on top of their game.
88;this film is on the violent end of the spectrum so that may change your opinion of the film depending on where your opinion stands on that type of thing, but honestly this movie is well worth it, great love story, memorable characters, excellent writing, acting, directing and cinematography.
89;The score to this film is incredibly catchy and I loved it as well, so many bit parts by amazing actors Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson to name a few.
90;the director's cut has few changes that I noticed from the VHS edition I had, with one very noticeable and effective change in the final shootout scene.
91;It is a decided improvement,The best thing about the two.
92;disk set is all the special features.
93;watch with commentary by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.
94;face R so that I could recommend it to a wider audience.
95;Nevertheless, the acting is flawless, direction on target and some scenes are absolutely brilliant.
96;The sheer number of talented actors whose screen time is minimal is enough to make it worth the running time for serious aficianados of film.
97;and man, is it awesome.
98;The deleted material is excellent.
99;It was insightful, informative and often hilarious, and I liked how they stayed in character for the better half of the commentary.
100;There's a great featurette that lets you go inside the movie, plus many other great stuff.
101;It's got a memorable score.
102;It's got a tour de force confrontation between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, all venom and sarcasm, all played to the tune of The Flower Duet.
103;And it's written by Quentin Tarantino.
104;For my money, this is the most romantic film ever.
105;Hard edged, gritty reality where romance and sweetness are highly unlikely to surface and thrive.
106;one of the directors most underrated movies yet.
107;Some VERY intense scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat or cheering with joy.
108;I have watched this movie many times but it still captures me with something new each time I view it.
109;I love the playful yet gritty nature of it, the colorful characters and the masterful blend of action and romance.
110;It was great to revisit my favorite movie of all time.
111;Anyone and everyone should each this film.
112;It's a true classic that should not be missed.
113;Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, Tarantino, a pimp, a love story, sex, violence, drugs.
114;what's not to love?This movie is one of my all time top ten.
115;my favorite monologue in film history involves Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen and the history of the Sicilian race.
116;Nevertheless, everybody in the cast is at his best, and they all do their part equally well.
117;studded opening credits because there are two notable names, Samuel Jackson and Val Kilmer, that don't seem to be part of the film.
118;All in all, True Romance has the moxie to keep the pacing even.
119;This is a great movie by all means.
120;witty script, splendid acting, enchanting music and swift direction by Tony Scott.
121;a story board that shows as a subtitle throughout the film .
122;play this with Tarantino's commentary and you have another movie to watch!
123;Do yourself a favor and make sure you watch this flick.
124;It is simply the best movie freaking ever.
125;All star cast of great performances from Christopher Walken.
126;Item was received in excellent condition and within time indicated.
127;great loved it gave it to my son it was a gift ,.
128;he loved it,,what else can i say ty
129;This is a film filled with memorable moments and wonderful dialogue.
130;And thus ensues a cross country adventure that involves the mob, the DEA, a movie producer, and a cool looking purple cadillac.
131;Oh well, these things happen sometimes.
132;and you start to get the picture, and the intended or unintended overlaps.
133;hero, trying to do the right thing by his girl, by the way, hotter than a four alarm fire!
134;and further, will undoubtedly notice the striking similarities, those familial ties.
135;the families that slay together, stay together!
136;Scene with James Gandolfini is epic.
137;True Romance is one of the most overlooked movies of the 90's.
138;Each character has a diamond sharp set of lines to deliver that are worthy dialogue for a lead.
139;The cast is full of A. list celebrities and performances that will be burned into your memory for life.
140;Gary Oldman as Drexel the pimp with racial identity issues, the epic sit down between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and Alabama's compelling sincerity are a few of the many stand out elements in this wonderful film.
141;Part of what makes it so special is all the surprises.
142;They are so in love and I just keep a smile on my face the entire time I'm watching it.
143;It is my fiance's favorite movie and I had never seen it until last week.
144;A very wild and unpredictable story line.
145;I love the entire thing, start to finish.
146;Gary Oldman played such a rare character too.
147;great acting by the entire crew.
148;Great movie if you like Quentin Tarantino and great cast.
149;THE best action movie, ever!
150;It has an all star cast and a very good plot.
151;There are a lot of staples of a Q. t film in this one.
152;vision scene, which is something I always look forward to in a Quentin Tarantino movie.
153;This one felt a bit more intense than some of the others.
154;The soundtrack was great, every did a great job from Slater and Arquette to Walken and Kilmer.
155;Even the few seconds you see Brad Pitt or Samuel L. Jackson was fun.
156;For all fans of Tarantino, crime movies or even a good love story, you will love this amazing and even overlooked piece of cinematic history.
157;This is one of my top 5 movies of all time.
158;Great extra footage on the 2nd disc.
159;Loved this movie when it came out in theaters and hadn't seen it on video since.
160;i loved it even more on video.
161;It's amazing how Quentin still plagarizes this movie.
162;walken, Hopper, Oldman, Pitt, and of course Slater and Arquette are all sheer perfection.
163;by far one of the best distorted violent love stories of all time.
164;The direction and acting are superb.
165;Wow what a ride this story is.
166;stop reading this review and go and watch the best movie i have ever seen.
167;rays now and to have one your favorite movies if all time on blu .
168;I love this movie, and I always want to show it to new friends but can never find it in a video store.
169;The price was right, so I bought it and can watch it whenever I want now.
170;"Yes, I like this film much better than ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and I like those films very well."
171;This one has it all though.
172;Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater, in the lead romantic roles, are their best ever as two semi.
173;Brad Pitt is absolutely marvelous in a totally comic role as Floyd, the spaced out, laid back, stunted IQ marvel who befuddles the bad guys.
174;All three are perfect in these supporting roles.
175;This film also contains probably the best shoot.
176;This is a great old movie.
177;Ordered it got it loved it.
178;Sopranos star James Gandolfini as one of Christopher Walken's goons?Brad Pitt as Floyd, the wacky pot.
179;this movie is for you!
180;Happy to add to my collection.
181;The scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is one of the best in modern cinema.
182;And what a great cast.
183;A high point for Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.
184;And pitch perfect performances from all of the featured supporting players.
185;One of the best movies that Tarintino has ever written!
186;This was a very fun film to watch.
187;This movie had great little sub.
188;And an awsome all start cast.
189;It's a great story when great performances and I personally cannot recommend it enough if you like Tarantino's style.
190;the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is, quite frankly, a classic in every sense of the word.
191;Brad Pitt as the stoner and Gary Oldman as the pimp are also truly remarkable.
192;It's the minor performances that make this movie.
193;Clarence Wirly, (Cristian Slater) is a comic book/Elvis fan who meets his soulmate during Sonny Chiba double feature.
194;Instantly the viewer develops an admiration for the undying love that the two young adults share.
195;Clarence and Alabama are up against the wall in this love story that combines, violence,treachery and unyielding action.
196;If you love this movie, hopefully you can share it with your significant other and recite the words.
197;This movie is that good!!!!!!
198;Fantastic one on one scene featuring Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, who sizzle with accusatory dialogue complete with timely humor.
199;We all know what happens in a good love story and this one lives up to the reputation.
200;The movie is great though.
201;Thanks to those who do this.
202;I give it a 9.3 on a 10 point scale.
203;It was nice to know which actor played each part.
204;this movie is really good, with many memorable parts.
205;love love love this movie.
206;Will want to share this!
207;This is rip roaring hilarious.
208;love this movie so much.
209;I found it here too for the best price
210;Christian Slater, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Val Kilmer, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Michael Rappaport, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Bronson Pinchot, Ed Laughter, Sal Rubinek, my God what a cast!
211;This is a great movie!
212;It has also adged very well considering that it's practically a decade old already!
213;This movie will satisfy fans of Tarantino and those who aren't!
214;It may not be everyone's cup of tea and diehard fans of Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction probably won't be replaying this over and over but it did have its fans and it's thankfully a cult film that's worth watching.
215;Problem is mobsters want that suitcase and cops will also stumble on it and Clarence and Alabama are caught right in the middle.
216;liners and witty dialogue one right after another, it's more humanistic and honest with some funny quips thrown in.
217;It's one of my favorite things about the film in that it's not some big witty line extravaganza which something like From Dusk Till Dawn became.
218;It's more character driven much like Jackie Brown and it's all the better for it.
219;on and pretty impressive too with Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman in a funny performance, Val Kilmer as Elvis, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken.
220;That's all remedied with probably one of my favorite Mexican standoff/shootout scenes I've seen with a whole ****load of feathers flying around.
221;The best script written by Tarantino, IMO, and the best film directed by Tony Scott.
222;Scott and Tarantino are amongst the best in their fields, and this really show's throughout the film.
223;Christopher Walken's role is one of his best.
224;Well written and wonderfully portrayed .
225;it is one of the best movies of the decade!
226;Arquette, on the other hand, is excellent in the role of Alabama.
227;Very interesting and easy on the eyes.
228;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
229;Written by Tarantino, its all about great dialog!
230;And constant action, perfect amount of my kind of romance with a high body count.
231;And a star studded cast.
232;"True Romance may very well be in the top ten of greatest action films of all time ranging in the same category as such classics as ""Leon: The Professional, John Woo's The Killer, The Matrix"" and so on."
233;in walks Patricia Arquette who instantly ignites passion and clicks through to Christian's true character.
234;They experience their first night together and are immediately in love .
235;the performances are splendid by all, and the extreme violence make this Bonnie and Clyde type of movie all the more enjoyable.
236;This is the rare movie in which all the scenes that were deleted, should have actually remained in the movie.
237;"I would enjoyed ""True Romance"" just that much more if Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino spliced the deleted scenes back in."
238;other than that, this remains a classic on the all levels.
239;This is definitely one of Tarrantino's best scripts.
240;Memorable performances by Patricia Arquette and The late great James Gandolfini.
241;Christian Slater was a the peak of his career.
242;The 'Eggplant' scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is one the best structured and written scenes I have ever seen in a film.
243;This was just not a movie I enjoyed, however there are those out there that loved this movie.
244;Watching it now, and seeing all these stars before they were top billed was awesome.
245;You will laugh and cry at this highly charged cult classic by Quentin Tarantino.
246;Christian Slater was born for this role.
247;Arquette, Oldham, Walken, Pitt are outstanding.
248;Great Movie to give as a gift.
249;She was very happy with it.
250;the one who will have sex in a phone booth and isn't afraid of talking to a ghost elvis!in all seriousness, this movie has remained one of my favorites of all time!
251;between her resourcefulness and her courage and bravery, i would say she is the strength of that particular twosome!
252;not only is he handsome, he is a good guy who will always be there for his lady.
253;i would also recommend boondock saints and pulp fiction.
254;Always liked this star studded well directed flick.
255;Now I have it to enjoy whenever.
256;One of the best shoot em up romance movies you'll ever see.
257;This is just an excellent movie.
258;Can't say how much I love it.
259;True Romance is best summed up in one word.
260;This flick has action,suspense and of course romance, not to mention great acting by everyone.
261;A ton of big starts are in this flick too, Brad Pitt, Samuel Jackson, Christian Slater, etc.
262;But True Romance did just that.
263;It's just a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a film buff.
264;With each turn, a new superstar emerges and delivers one of his/her greatest performances in a great long while.
265;"Maybe it's the naturality of the dialogue in Tarantino's script
266;The greatest scene in the film?
267;While it's certainly crude and offensive and not found in your average Disney flick, this scene is the gem of this 2 hour romp.
268;I can't really say what it's about, but it's really incredible how well the chemistry between two great actors and one helluva script come together.
269;Gary Oldman is pretty freakin' good in this movie too.
270;Still, it's a really good movie and well worth the few hard.
271;One of the best movies!
272;Highly recommended for Tarantino fans.
273;I didn't know that earlier but it totally makes sense.
274;Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN is a fun adaptation as is GET SHORTY.
275;I wanted to point you to these other films as well.
276;If you liked TRUE ROMANCE you may enjoy these as well.
277;His books are great too.
278;Glad I got the 2 disc Director's cut.
279;this film has more star power than any movie i know.
280;even so, this was my favorite movie till Pulp Fiction came out and still is in my top 10.
281;the first half of the movie is great, though!
282;arquette is so sexy she reminds me of Marilyn in Diamonds.
283;this movie is a must see!
284;The movie is, of course, terrific, but you already know that, or you wouldn't be reading this.
285;The director's cut is far superior to the 1997 edition, much sharper, much better definition.
286;That said, we take what we receive and it is an interesting viewing experience indeed.
287;Central to the film is the lovers.
288;What resonates with me are three high.
289;The second, which is now classic, involves Dennis Hopper who plays Slater's dad and Christopher Walken as a mob lawyer.
290;Let your imagination run wild.
291;Now that Gandolfini has a certain public persona this scene now has more resonance.
292;off at the end of the film in the hotel room that is something of a homage to John Woo.
293;All said, this film is a joyride from start to finish but a rewarding one at that.
294;better than pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, set all .
295;Great movie in perfect condition, no trailers or ads.
296;great performances by iconic actors and actresses.
297;Slater's best, full of stars, even Brad Pitt has a small part.
298;I love this movie for the story and the star power.
299;Christian Slater is a good actor.
300;edge of your seat movie,very entertaining,good actors,worth your money something you can watch over again
301;so I actually like him in anything.
302;Not a must see but a cute movie.
303;Watching this again reminded me why Quentin Tarantino is brilliant.
304;The dialogue in this movie is some of his best.
305;The movie looks great and holds up well.
306;After his first unnecessary murder He comes back home to tell her about it, and She starry eyed finds that what he did sooo romantic.
307;now Pulp Fiction works because it is a parody, Natural Born Killers and Silence of Lambs works because in all their excess we understand that the killers are psychopaths.
308;Cinema of this caliber is an art form, and art has power.
309;It is cool, hip and fun to watch.
310;Although some parts are very violent it is still very entertaining.
311;Directed by Tony scott this movie a masterpiece.
312;Rated R for Strong violence, lauguge and some sexuality this movie deserves 4 stars!
313;It's interesting to know that this flick was written by Quentin Tarantino, and he sold it in order to raise capital to make Reservoir Dogs.
314;Great business idea on his side, Super plot.
315;because frankly, it's best to watch it without knowing what will happen.
316;I guarantee you'll like it.
317;seeing disc two that included the actor interviews, the extra scenes, and the director/writer commentary were SO COOL, SO COOL, SO COOL.
318;It was also interesting seeing the original ending that Tarantino intended in his screenplay, and was nice hearing his opinion of why it would of worked better if he had directed the movie, rather than how Tony Scott chose to end it and why.
319;it's a great thrill ride.
320;C'mon, Christian Slater, Dennis Hoper, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, on and on.
321;It made the gritty fairy tale romance complete for me.
322;I totally bought Patricia Arquette's Alabama (she is the heart and soul of this film, .
323;True Romance is, in certain ways, an even more accurate representation of Quentin Tarantino's works than Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, for it contains both Tarantino's strongest and weakest forts.
324;fortunately, Alabama is one of his best attempts, and she is definitely better than the whiny Fabienne and Honey Bunny from Pulp Fiction.
325;top hamming better than any other"
326;who hints at his future greatness here with a delivery that is both sadistic and human, humorous and scary, just like his immortal turn later as Tony Soprano.
327;the corniness of the romance is part of the character of this film, though when it reaches critical mass levels in one or two scenes (such as the airport scene, the what you did is so romantic scene, and the incredibly craven final .
328;I kind of wish they could have kept the best elements from both the official and the deleted original ending (available here): The toughness and character depth of the original ending but without the pretension, and the hope for redemption of the official ending.
329;but enough analysis (though the film deserves it).
330;disc rerelease's bonus materials, to me, are much more appealing than those of the recent Reservoir Dogs reissue.
331;A key film of the '90s, and to me, Quentin Tarantino's second most important contribution to cinema.
332;The product was in excellent condition.
333;Played well through WII on TV.
334;This movie has some of the greatest one on one scenes I've seen.
335;The eggplant exchange between hopper and Walken is brilliant.
336;This is a very good movie , my freind loved it .
337;It was new and sealed.
338;Christian Slater was just remarkable in this film.
339;Great story line put together with a great cast of movie bigs,even the not so well known did a splended job.
340;the story involves two people who come together and fall in love instantly, the two in question are Clarence, a comic book store clerk, and Alabama, a first time prostitute.
341;but at the heart of this film is just a simple heart warming love story between two social outcasts and their quest for happiness.
342;this film was always going to be good, but thanks to everyone involved in the making of this film it is awesome.
343;Tony Scott does a fantastic job of bringing Quentin Tarantino's brilliant script to life.
344;And the performances from the large ensemble cast is inspiring.
345;While the film belongs to Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette special mention should also go to everyone involved for giving their all.
346;put simply this film is essential if you like be immersed in your films you will like this.
347;This is a great film with some trademark Terantino dialogue that just really leaves with a feeling.
348;This movie has great action and great humor.
349;The humor involved is witty and funny(classic Terantino).
350;It has a great cast with Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Walken, etc.
351;overall this is a great action film.
352;The special edition is really great and gives you a lot of bonus features.
353;This is a great movie to own, and it has made it in between all my mob and war movies.
354;I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
355;This movie has everything, and everyone.
356;core cops, mobsters, classic cars, comic books.
357;And literally everyone who was anyone at the time, and quite a few who have since gone and become cult favorites.
358;This updated version of Terrence Mallick's wonderful Badlands brings back many elements of the original (mainly the music and voice.
359;off, or borrowed, it works in this film and made it that much more enjoyable.
360;And I was greatly impressed, not only with the acting, but the writing as well.
361;This is an excellent and very underrated film.
362;I was totally impressed with his character and acting.
363;Even some of the character actor's I usually don't like were outstanding.
364;Alabama is a prostitute who works for a very mean SOB.
365;Enter (Christopher Walken), a former mob hitman, and presently well.
366;Hopper's interaction with Walken is great, and to divulge it would ruin it for those of you who have not seen the film.
367;(Christopher Penn) plays one of the drug agents, and he plays the role great.
368;He is fantastic in his role.
369;(Tom Sizemore) is Penn's partner and he is really great in his role too.
370;This film is highly recommended.
371;Very suspenseful, and wonderfully written plot make this a 5 star film!
372;fresh from his debut in reservoir dogs, tarantion concocted a underrated crime saga, which was also part love story.
373;so, get yourself some egg rolls and check out this underrated classic.
374;Quentin Tarantino wrote the ultimate guy flick in the form of a romance movie, and then let Tony Scott polish it off with a bit of Hollywood sparkle.
375;It just represents a sort of middle of the road movie that really could have been so much more, but still satisfies.
376;the biggest draw of the movie is the star power, and more so the chemistry between certain actors and actresses in the many key scenes of the movie.
377;Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken play their cameos to the hilt, while Gary Oldman's performance as an urbanized white pimp absolutely steals the show in the first half of the movie.
378;This results in a strangely mesmerizing but disjointed movie experience, as the movie definitely shines and lulls in its given moments.
379;but still, this movie is way smarter and more enjoyable than many other summer blockbusters that get tossed out there and deserved more acclaim in its 1993 debut than it originally received.
380;While not considered Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece, this film is important as we think about boys' initiation into manhood.
381;Patricia Arquette gets one of the gutsiest fight scenes I've ever seen.
382;Now that I think about it, everyone is in this film (Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Gary Oldman, Balki.
383;A film that is important and didn't get the respect it deserved.
384;'True Romance' was written by one of the best writer/director's of all time.
385;He did a very nice job with the writing.
386;The casters put a pretty good cast in it, too.
387;She was good as Christian Slater's love interest.
388;Christian Slater was good, too.
389;He was also good in 'Interview With The Vampire' (Also with Brad Pitt).
390;well, the story is about a man named Clarence (Christian Slater) who falls in love with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette).
391;Alabama tells Clarence that she wants to go away somewhere and that all of her stuff is at her Pimp (Gary Oldman)'s place.
392;It's a suitcase full of coke!
393;And the rest, well, you have to go go and see it.
394;Tony Scott's True Romance has become something of a minor classic in the years since its original 1993 release.
395;It's a great, often overlooked film and I recommend it regularly to people who like Tarantino.
396;It's a story full of Tarantino's trademarks: graphic violence, movie references, great dialogue, quirky characters, shootouts, etc.
397;I don't doubt that the film would have been a masterpiece if Tarantino had directed, but Tony Scott does a admirable job.
398;His direction is straightforward and non.
399;He just stands back and lets Tarantino's characters and dialogue run wild.
400;A guy and a girl, madly in love, come across a suitcase full of cocaine and are out to get rid of it while avoiding the gangsters that are on their tails.
401;The exceptional cast doesn't hurt either.
402;The cast is great, and the two leads Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both very good and believable as a young couple.
403;Despite the seemingly ironic title, it actually is a romance at heart.
404;disc special edition is the one to own.
405;it's a very enjoyable movie that fans of the crime/gangster/action genre are sure to like and fans of Quentin Tarantino will certainly enjoy.
406;so where does he fit with this particular film.
407;well for me,it's a hit.
408;with lots of action,there lots of violence and bloodshed in this one,but there are also some tender and dramatic moments,which are handled well.
409;the dialogue is sharp and clever and there are some memorable characters.
410;much of the credit of that must go to Quentin Tarantino,who wrote the script.
411;i found True Romance entertaining on all levels.
412;but be warned,it is extremely violent and there is a lot of very strong language.
413;Great mix of crime and romance, this movie will take you by surprise and is one of the most underrated movies of the early 90s.
414;Tarantino has written this movie and he do a perfect job.
415;Clarence, a young man (Christian Slater, who is talking to Elvis) and Alabama, a callgirl (Patricia Arquette) are getting married.
416;But there is a lot of action, love, blood and a very explosive showdown.
417;The shootout at the end (where cops and the mafia are shooting each other) is very brutal but perfect directed.
418;"Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" (1994) is a cocktail mixture of action, drugs, sex and violence rollicking with the heedless enthusiasm of a newborn puppy in a Christmas box."
419;top situations centering on a comic store clerk and a call girl who fall in love and set about making their mark in the world.
420;scripted by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary, the film exists in a high.
421;"term goal of ""getting far, far away"" throughout the film is revealed as spending money, making love and lying around on tropical beaches."
422;something college dorm inhabitants, the film can be enjoyed for what it is: an entertaining action movie with lots of crazy dialog, fast.
423;the two stars, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, are ideally cast for their roles.
424;numbers performance with the exception of a tense yet hilarious speech delivery on Sicilian genetics.
425;Christopher Walken instantly tops the speech and calmly egresses with his usual cool.
426;This is an awesome movie!
427;I definitely recommend watching this movie.
428;First of all, this movie is one of my favorites of ALL TIME.
429;This is truly a guy's fantasy love story.
430;Think about it, a chick that's into a guy that loves comics and kung fu flicks.
431;A testament to Tarantino's writing, the direction and the acting: I'm a black guy and I think it's probably one of the most classic scenes I have EVER seen in a movie.
432;For those of you that have seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about.
433;the other actors were great as well.
434;In terms of casting, this movie was sheer perfection.
435;There's also a live storyboard display that you can look at while watching the movie.
436;I also love the longer beatup scenes with James Gandolfini.
437;Lots of twists that all come together at the end.
438;great acting and great line of actors.
439;Well, what can I say, a great freakin' movie.
440;Now, I am not the biggest Tarantino fan, but I do love this movie and Pulp Fiction.
441;The thing that draws me to his movies is the dialogue.
442;It's the way people really talk!
443;If you want censored films, watch Disney.
444;If you like the whole action film thing, this movie is for you.
445;If you like the whole love story thing, this film is for you.
446;If you like movies with multiple stars.you guessed it, this film is for you.
447;This movie is so good, it has background characters such as Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and Val Kilmer.
448;Best work from Tony Scott.
449;And this director's cut even better than the original seen on TV.
450;Otherwise, it is in good shape and came on time.
451;Lots of star power to back this hit up.
452;This movie shipped on time and in good condition.
453;It would have been very interesting to see the final film in Tarantino's vision.
454;coated adaptation works wonders though.
455;It was made very clear in the script that the relationship between the two leads was very strong.
456;Hans Zimmer's score does nothing better, than to enforce this vision.
457;the cast is one of the most impressive line.
458;Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both characters come off very likable with clear, clean, simple motives.
459;It is in his time shared with Christopher Walken (being a one.
460;"scene wonder, like in ""Pulp Fiction""), that he comes off at his best."
461;"The Sicilian scene is Walken's most intense since ""Deer Hunter""."
462;Gary Oldman also gives another deliciously evil and memorable performance, the man is a chameleon, he is yet to unimpress me.
463;unknowns Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini in small, but memorable roles.
464;True Romance is a brilliant crime drama, and a perfect (if phased) introduction to Tarantino's work, it is probably the most accessible film he's penned.
465;assure that Scott has given a wonderful adaptation, supported by a very strong cast.
466;Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper we're absolutely fantastic.
467;There are two many roles to mention.
468;Scott did an excellent job with the script although it may have a sunnier disposition than Tarantino's other films.
469;Some of the classic Tarantino lines of all time, several adlibs, and phenomenal scenes that are way outside the edge of reality, but it works.
470;A better ensemble cast than anything else you're liable to find.
471;Patricia Arquette is yummy, Hopper is in rare form, Walken is as menacing as he is weird, Oldman makes a great pimp, we find out about Samuel L's sexual preferences, and Slater manages to turn in a credible understated but high energy performance.
472;A monument to the Nintendo generation I suppose but a great movie worth watching over and over again.
473;Beautiful people,tons of death,romance,excitement,adventure,love and Brad Pitt with a honey bear bong.
474;This has everything that I personally enjoy in a movie.
475;It's smart, witty and violent.
476;"An excellent love story complete with those three little words
477;When you mix together a Tarantino script and Tony Scott, you get one unusual film!
478;Christian Slater is a loser who works in a comic book store.
479;It is a truly unusual film.
480;Its certainly is not nearly as good as some of the films Tarantino had up his sleave in the future but it was a step in the right direction.
481;All his fans should definately check this film out.
482;star cast adds to the great romance story of unconventional characters.
483;Brad Pitt is in it and acting like he invented the Pineapple Express!
484;I wanted a good clean family fun and after five minutes.
485;True Romance is a rare flilm as it pertains to being a movie you could watch again and again!By far, this is Christian Slater's best career performance of his career!Thanks.
486;this film is beyond description.
487;all i can say is that it contains some of the most fascinating characters ive ever seen.
488;Gary oldmans role as derxal spivey is one of the greatest badd a** white guy roles put in film.
489;A delightful modern odyssey, if you can tolerate periodic over.
490;Terrific and extensive cast bring to life a dazzling array of characters.
491;And, our hero and heroine make it through in one piece.
492;For Quentin Tarantino, it's about average which means an enjoyable violent, fun crime movie (as if violence is ever fun).
493;The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper alone is worth the price of the movie.
494;An All Star cast, this movie will not disappoint!
495;all in all, a superb film, with everyone involved at the top of their respective games.
496;My main interest in seeing it was James Gandolfini .
497;he was a personal favorite.
498;for a really good """"True Romance"""" movie, check out """"Train Man : Densha Otoko""""."""
499;One of he finest films made.
500;Reminiscent of movies past where there is a beginning and middle and and end.
501;One of my favorite movies of all time.
502;The scene with Hopper and Walken is a Hollywood classic, and was supposedly improvised.
503;Oldman plays a great character.
504;What hinders it most is first the self.
505;The other occasional hinderance is the overwhelming star power in the movie.
506;Rarely do you see so many big.
507;name actors competing for screen space, and it's downright surreal if you've seen some of their other famous performances.
508;these and other factors make it impossible to take True Romance seriously, but it's still extremely entertaining.
509;1 and more shamelessly comic than Reservoir Dogs .
510;Gary Oldman provides some of the funniest moments as the pimp who 'only wishes' he were black ( He musta thought it was white boy day!
511;This film is violent but plenty of bits , thrills and surprises .
512;the sequences of the chases are first rate , but the peak of the crown may be well in the dialogue between Chris Walken and Dennis Hopper moments previous to the murder in which both colossal actors make a tour de force that signed the film to status cult movie .
513;christian Slater is fine , and Pitt is very credible as a dealer .
514;fine script and watchable film , filled with histamina!Dazzling direction of Tony Scott!
515;TRUE romance!With such an amazing cast of unpredictable, fun and wild characters and the award winning talent portraying them, this film was absent from my life for far too long.
516;Having said that, as an older viewer now, as opposed to 1993, I appreciate and enjoy seeing this phenomenal cast as much as the intriguingly classic and wild story delivered.
517;This is a prime time Tarantino story with a superb cast and great music.
518;As I said, that's entertainment.
519;My favorite among the smaller parts is Walken, who is, as usual, a very very bad guy, but so elegantly and charmingly here.
520;one question comes up: there are half a dozen great male roles here, but practically only one woman, other than extras.
521;Must mean something, but what?Have fun!
522;It's very much worth the price.
523;Do I dare say it is a masterpiece?
524;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give oscar worthy performances.
525;the story has Christian Slater's comic.
526;Quite a lot like the movie itself .
527;Entertaining, good actors and storyline.
528;Saw this movie a while ago and enjoyed it as much as the first time.
529;True Romance proves that amazing acting skills of many well known actors in their early days of acting with a movie that shine light on the ablility to act.
530;It has also one of best scripts in hollywood by Tarantino with lots of one liners that will make you laugh and repeat over and over again no matter how many times you watch the movie.
531;It lived up to all the hyped people told me about it and I still gave it 5 stars because of the director, the actors, and the writer all made an amazing movie and I look forward to Tarantino's new one that came out for Christmas 2012.
532;It has a mixture of humor one liners, action, drama, mutiple gun fight scenes so pardon the pun it's a very killer movie that will blow you away.
533;It also has the romance aspect when you know you would die for a woman then you have found your true love to spend rest of your life with.
534;This was a good movie because of the fun cast.
535;Christian Slater did well with the lead role, and I am surprised that he doesn't take on very many leads.
536;This movie lived up to every one of a Tarantino fan's expectations, and aside from the extremely strong language, the dialogue was fun.
537;I recommend it to college aged kids in a group setting.
538;This was a fun movie.
539;Some of the best dialogue ever is in this film.
540;That was one of the most perfect scenes in the history of perfect scenes.
541;the best story ever there should be a sequel what does he want to do to blu lou after killin his dad
542;True Romance is a great film.
543;If it is full on Quentin, see Killing Zoe , if you want a film with equally great tallent, a killer soundtrack, and an Arquette fix, see True Romance tonite.
544;True Romance is a personal favorite.
545;Watching it for the first time a decade ago, was mind.
546;The movie was my introduction to Quentin Tarantino's world, it's an amalgam of everything I love about his work.
547;This is a touchstone of 90's cinema, a film geek essential.
548;The awesome grand finale is the best mexican standoff since The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly .
549;Revisiting True Romance is like seeing old friends again.
550;While the film itself is the usual Quentin Tarantino goofiness, the pace and the acting makes this film a must see.
551;And the acting is incredible.
552;Their final confrontation scene may be one of the most amazing dialogs between two great actors ever filmed.
553;Christopher Walken Dennis Hopper share a brief moment in this movie, and it is, without a doubt, the best display of passive aggressive behaviour in any movie, ever.
554;To be honest, I never liked Christian Slater, but he is okay in this movie.
555;The Last scene in the Producer's Hotel Suite is also fantastic.
556;This adventure is True escapism at it's best !
557;The two lead characters are a sweet blend of sociopathic/psychopathic.
558;this movie will make you laugh,cry&get angry!
559;Yeah, it pushes all the right buttons.
560;Everyone was so wonderful in the film!
561;Full of action, laughs (Brad Pitt) and pure violence (James Gandolphini)I can watch this any day of the week!
562;GREAT cast and the action is non.
563;How young and gorgeous are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette?
564;True RomanceI have 3 favorite movies because they are movies with a spirit that refuses to die.
565;Clarence (the main character) had such a good time with this call girl that he didn't care about her profession.
566;He has to free her from her fears to let her realize he'll protect her from anything.
567;"There you have it
568;Yeah, True Romance is good, especially the fringe characters played by Gary Oldham, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, and especially Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper (their scene together is truly brilliant).
569;top performances, Willem Dafoe's Bobby Peru is even more memorable (and terrifying) than Oldham's Drexel.
570;Enjoy and appreciate True Romance if you like .
571;and I DO enjoy it.
572;One of the Best Movies ever made.
573;Super cast of awesome characters.
574;One of my favorite movies of all time!
575;Christian Slater is amazing, Brad Pitt is hilarious.
576;This is really a masterpiece.
577;A violent masterpiece, yes, but a masterpiece nonetheless.
578;Tarantino didn't set out to make a fairy tale when he wrote it but the changes that Tony Scott made (as small as they were) really changed the theme of the movie and made it lighter and more like a fairy tale.
579;patricia Arquette acted out really well in this film and the role perfectly fit her.
580;Call me crazy, but she really seems to be enjoying playing the """"hooker."""
581;The scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is one of cinemas greatest ever scenes!
582;and Brad Pitts Cleaning Products line was a brilliant ad.
583;Even Samuel L Jackson gets a high billing in the credits, but is in the film for less than 5 minutes!
584;what more can I say, this is a collection of brilliantly written scenes, filled with memorable quotes and held together by a sweet, believable and totally mad storyline with a better.
585;The weakest point is Bronson Pinchot, but even he keeps pace well.
586;If you like your movies fast, mean and outrageously raw you'll have a blast with this one.
587;I love the whole lore behind everything.
588;There is a unrated special edition coming in september of 2002, so you might want hold off on getting this now.
589;Bought this for my husband who loves this movie.
590;Great Movie for anyone who hasnt seen it.
591;This movie is seriously the best movie of all time.
592;And this disc is awesome because it has both the movie filmed with the Tony Scott ending, as well as the movie with the original Quentin Tarantino written ending.
593;No doubt this is one of my favorite movies.
594;I was surprised at first to discover that its director was the same guy who made Top Gun but it makes a certain kind of sense.
595;The movie is kind of comic.
596;booky, perhaps a reflection of the innocence and distorted reality of the two main characters.
597;life, and Clarence and Alabama are super cool and beautiful, even.
598;what really makes this a fantastic movie though, is the way it combines so much cool stuff into a movie without the plot becoming overly complex.
599;The script is great, the music by Hans Zimmer is great, and all of the little supporting performances.
600;Enjoy it for the fun.
601;Not oscar material, but fun!
602;One of my favorite movies of all times.
603;graphic in violence, love, and imagery.
604;Tarantino does his magic on this script, which is less complex than his other films, but quite a bit more fun.
605;The movie is a rollercoaster ride of funny scenes and gunplay, with some big name actors to boot.
606;Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater are very good together, and were cast perfectly.
607;They're quite funny, and whoever plays Elvis (Think Batman) does a great impression.
608;This is a good movie to watch with friends, and 've actually found it to be a good date movie.
609;I recommend this to action fans, romance fans, drama fans, comedy fans.
610;This movie didnt get the proper respect that it has deserved over the years.
611;This is one of Tarantino's best, second of course to Pulp Fiction.
612;All in all this movie is filled with action and humorous parts.
613;Brad Pitt does an excellent job as the stoner roommate of Slater's friend in California.
614;This movie is great and I recommend it to any Tarantino fan.
615;Christian Slater is truly a True Romantic in the Tarintino written flik, just not in the way Hollywood may have prepared you for it.
616;Of course the name Tarintino on it SHOULD bring that to your attention right away.
617;Out to show Patrita Arquette just how much he loves her, and that he will do ANYTHING for her.
618;This is just the start mind you.
619;You will see, and FEEL, his love for her.
620;mIND, BECAUSE they love each other.
621;Strongly recomend this picture to everyone.
622;Slater is amazing, Arquette very much his equal.
623;From the start of the movie until the end, thrill ride to the max.
624;This movie is in my top 10
625;Not your usual love story, but well played and engaging.
626;Loved this movie back in the day and still do.
627;The dialogue is so well written.
628;For Tarantino fans a must own.
629;Stars are all over in this true love film.
630;Kept me on the edge my seat, but expect some blood.
631;This was a great story.
632;The first time I saw this movie I thought it had everything you need for a great movie, but I really didn't appreciate its brilliance.
633;This is a movie just gets better and better and better.
634;every time you see it.
635;It includes a cast so strong that it could never be assembled today.
636;Plus Dennis Hopper and Christfer Walken have one the greatest scenes ever filmed.
637;Also, the Director's Cut adds little lines and slightly changes the ending, improving and already great movie.
638;One of the truly best ensemble pieces of all times.
639;Just IMDB the cast and know that everyone of them gave a stellar performance.
640;Penned by Quentin Tarantino, Scott's cheeky, hyper.
641;up stamp on the lovers.
642;Slater and the foxy Arquette are perfectly matched, her Jessica Lange.
643;Scott's ace in the hole, apart from Tarantino's ballistic script, is his gallery of supporting actors: Oldman's dreadlocked pimp, Brad Pitt's hilariously clueless stoner, and Christopher Walken's ice.
644;Romance is a stylish, high.
645;cool from the early 1990's to the present day.
646;focus, the voice BARELY gives him away), and Brad Pitt before he emerged as a solid leading actor for mainstream Hollywood displaying a talent for stealing every scene he's in without ever getting up from a sofa.
647;cast movie that really works.
648;The story itself is pure dime.
649;but like most successful art, it succeeds because its creator was inspired and working from his own heart.
650;"Tarantino generally writes screenplays for the type of movie he likes
651;Judging by the caliber of big.
652;extremely violent, sexy and innocent at the same time, very funny, and still hip after all these years.
653;One of my favorite movies of all time.
654;He works in a comic book shop.
655;She a beautiful blond named Alabama (Patricia Arquette), and Clarence can hardly believe it when she stumbles (literally actually) into his life.
656;Clarence proffesses his love back, and they set out to start a new life together.
657;now, the first thing I'd like to say is I think that Quentin tarantino is the real star of this film.
658;personally, I enjoyed """"True Romance"""" alot."""
659;That said, if you're able to suspend your disbelief a bit, it's a very fun movie.
660;It has a great fairy tale typle feel.
661;It has an AMAZING ensemble cast.You'll see Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Val Kilmer, brad Pitt and more.
662;Many of them before they broke it big career wise.
663;to wrap this up, I'll recommend it you in this way: If you liked Quentin Tarantino's other films.
664;and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief a bit.You should definitely see it.
665;A Really good movie to watch.
666;It is a masterpiece seldom seen.
667;Alabama is superb, Clarence even Elvis has a great spot.
668;he returns with what he beleives is her suitcase of clothes but when he gets back he discovers he has a full suitcase of uncut cocaine worth millions.
669;"the scene where dennis hopper tells christopher walken ( a scicilian mafia king) that sicilians are really niggers"" is unforgettable and laugh out loud funny."
670;sometimes hilarious ,often bloody part allegory ( does slater really see elvis?)
671;every inch of this wonderfull film is a joy to watch.
672;This is worth seeing for the cast alone.
673;But, combined with Tarantino's writing, it really is a gem.
674;The scene with Hopper and Walken is brilliant.
675;I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.
676;A great movie to add to your collection.
677;Thank you for the opportunity.
678;Anyway good movie on both sides of the fence girls will like the love story and guys will love the mobster drug dealing story (even got James Gandolfini in it!)
679;This a great movie, C. Slater has a great role and does a fantastic job.
680;it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies ever!!!
681;disc Special Edition)By now most people know this Tarantino film is a classic.
682;disc special edition, it comes in a nice Collector's type package which looks good and is practical in size.
683;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, transcend in this tell of love gone awry!!
684;Let me tell you .
685;this is THE perfect chick flick man, THE perfect one.
686;When I think of it, I compare it to a successful Bonnie and Clyde Movie.
687;Many small parts by such great actors.
688;Again, a very good movie.
689;star cast, a great story, and a romance movie that guys can totally enjoy too!
690;Not sure what this says about me, but I do think Clarence and Alabama's relationship is the ultimate romance .
691;"
692;There was something in this movie for everyone.
693;romance, comedy , a ton of action and more blood then i needed to see but it was an excellent movie.
694;a true modern American classic of cinema.
695;edit this great movie, the best one he ever did, and put it out with this footage included.
696;This is one of the best action movies i have ever seen, it has a good twist to it and a great ending, i would encourage whomever did not watch to go ahead and do so, do not skip watching it you won't be dissappointed.
697;What can I say, he is the master.
698;This film is classic Tarantino with all the action, laughs and twists you expect from him.
699;Great acting, great story and as usual with Tanantino great music.
700;I thought it was going to be used for the price I paid, but it was brand new!
701;It is my best friend's favorite movie, and after I watched it with him I can see why.
702;Great movie, recently recommended as a re.
703;edged muscle to the well.
704;Another great movie from 'screenwriter' Quentin Tarantino.
705;I didn't see this movie at the theatres, because I thought that it was going to be another corny, bad love story, but wow, was I ever wrong!This is a fast paced story with an excellent cast, and I even liked Patricia Arquette even though I am not her biggest fan.
706;She has a phenomenal scene near the end where she gets beat up, and like other scenes written by QT, it is amazingly real (and of course, violent).
707;This movie also has one of the scariest scenes that I have ever seen in a movie, when Gary Oldman and Christian Slater face off.
708;Maybe it's the music playing in the background, or maybe it's the dialogue, but either way, I was on the edge of my seat.
709;Quentin T wrote this movie so if you like his style, you will love this movie.
710;Fast, action, sex, drugs, twists, you name it, it is in here.
711;Great soundtrack too, my favorite is John Waite during the diner/pie scene In Dreams .
712;A definate must for QT fans!
713;True Romance is so far the most complete story told by Q. t., with gusto and bravado performances from the A level of today's male movie actors.
714;Even Slater looks good, and the lovely Ms. Arquette truly is a peach.
715;Best bits: For the body, the dinner.
716;Throughout the whole movie (this is not a film), the message is pure rockin' 'n' rollin' romance, and of course the soundtrack keeps up with the pace.
717;Fighting the evil forces with heroic bravado and fleeing with the beautiful princess and a bag full of cash?
718;Quentin Tarantio struck all the right notes when he wrote this fantastic motion picture, which, in my opinion, is the greatest motion picture of all time.
719;Everyone can find something in this film that will interest him.
720;If, on the other hand, you want comedy, drama, romance, and a good moral, this film has it, too.
721;I have read the original screenplay, and on the marvelous two.
722;I love you, I love you, I love you."""""""
723;So, thank you, Tony Scott, for forcing Quentin Tarantino to write the greatest ending of all time.
724;This motion picture is a wonderful film that I feel everyone should watch, own, love, and treasure for forever.
725;True Romance is one of those movies that has a scene for everybody, I think.
726;Walken and Hopper have a great interaction that pits perception against trivia, and the outcome is truly heroic.
727;Summing up the acting, it was all great.
728;the plot is really entertaining, in a What if.
729;The story is energetic, and all of the characters are interesting.
730;Especially Floyd (played by someone perfect for that part).
731;someone complained about all the cameos, but I find those entertaining.
732;It's always exciting and pleasing to recognize an actor on the screen.
733;:)Wanting to check my opinion of this movie, I watched it with my beloved snuggle.
734;I told her that I thought this was one of the most romantic movies I'd seen in a long time, and she agreed with me.
735;If you liked Pulp Fiction, The Replacement Killers and/or Tombstone, you'll probably enjoy this.
736;Everyone is perfectly cast, and you can just tell it's Quentin from the standard of character interplay and fly on the wall chit chat.
737;He actually has commentary on this, too.
738;the extras are pretty good, too.
739;"As Chris Walken so cleverly points out in his interview clip on the extras
740;It's true, if Shakespeare were around today, these are the kinds of scenarios and people he'd be accomadating.
741;This was an excellent movie.
742;A friend recommended it since I had never seen it.
743;It was action packed and had the love in it.
744;True Romance is a story written by the outrageous and wonderful Quintin Tarantino.
745;Unlike his other famous films, this one is not directed by him, but the director does a great job of staying true to what can only be described as the """"Quintinized"""" way of story telling."""
746;kicking women, will appreciate this tale as well.
747;This film is rich with colorful characters and the music is perfect.
748;This film is as close to perfect as they get.
749;True Romance is one of Christian Slater's best movies!
750;We love this movie, it is very realistic.
751;Patricia Arquette impressed us with her ability on screen.
752;Th plot, directing and acting in this movie were excellent.
753;paced, passionate, sexy, romantic, complete with a Mexican stand.
754;what more could you ask for in the perfect date movie?
755;If you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then, this is a must.
756;is one of my favorite movies of all time.
757;see for all Walken fans .
758;fabulous, funny dialogue, classic, sinister, creepy Walken.
759;And the scene with Virgil (James Gandolfini, ever the perfect mobster, even before Sopranos), the henchman, and Alabama .
760;beware the blind courage of a man pumped full of testosterone and adrenaline fueled by love!
761;ray, I can FINALLY see the details in the backgrounds during the first part of the film!
762;"The second part is in daytime Los Angeles, with its sunny smog, and here the colors (and detail) are also MUCH improved
763;On the same disc are generous bonus commentaries and scenes as well.
764;(a great title for this flick) Me, being of a somewhat newer generation, didn't think I'd like this movie from the title alone, but as soon as I read the description, I knew I"
765;"Drugs, prostitution, freedom, and most of all true love
766;I want to give it four and a half stars.
767;I loved it so much I recorded it have been watching the movie at least once a day the past few weeks.
768;The two have such a wonderful chemistry together and the cameos are great as well.
769;Everything about this movie is practically perfect"
770;Its true romance: reminds me of Sid and Nancy or Bonnie and Clyde except better sometimes.
771;Theres just some sort of feeling this movie captured so wonderfully that most films leave out.
772;Its good for both the guys and the chics out there.
773;Yea, man, Its obsession worthy.
774;This was another classic Tarrantino hit!
775;What can I say this is a cult classic, it never gets old!
776;The total amount of movie stars in this movie is staggering!
777;Director's Cut is a must have for fans, very good transferboth sound and picture.
778;There's energy here and a fast paced story that grabbed me right from the beginning and never let up.
779;There's also humor and lots of violence.
780;He's an Elvis fan and comic book freak who loves martial arts films.
781;She's been working as a call girl for only four days and is sent by his boss to show the boy a good time.
782;"But ""true romance"" constantly prevails between the couple."
783;I just relaxed and enjoyed.
784;I give it one of my highest recommendations.
785;There are some great one liners in this movie.
786;My favorite movie of all time!!!
787;I love it for so may reasons!!
788;Crazy story with lot's of action and great dialogue!!!
789;The genre type of movie sort of lists it in a class with Pulp Fiction meets a Dark love story.
790;first of all the acting is really well done.
791;The story is fast paced and interesting.
792;i love movies and this made it into my top ten.
793;This is a fly by gem that seemed never really to have made it.
794;The Elvis scenes are awesome.
795;Besides Mobsters this is one of my favorite Christian Slater movies.
796;I thought he did a great job with this movie.
797;A Full Throttle Blast .
798;Superb casting, excellent story and direction, and a deleted scene of Patricia Arquette in the tub.
799;The skit betweenChristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper was one of the funniest I have ever seen.
800;i like violence so I liked the movie.
801;Up to now I have watched it six times.
802;Definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's more underrated movies.
803;It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
804;It's a little lighter than some of his, but has elements of suspense.
805;The movie is both hilarious and thrilling.
806;The love story is pretty cute and Patricia Arquette's character super likable as is Christian Slater's, who comes across as really dumb, but a guy with a good heart.
807;The scenes with the mob characters have great dialogue.
808;Christopher Walken and James Gandolfini are excellent.
809;This is one my favourite films, one of those which can be watched as many times as we want, without ever getting old.
810;But he is special in one particulal way .
811;the Devil likes him and comes sometimes to visit and chat with him and because Clarence is a fanatical Elvis fan, well, to humour him the Devil takes the shape of Elvis Presley.
812;and that will start a sequence of events which will then continue until the extremely dramatic, bloody and brilliant great finale.
813;"the scenario of this 1993 film was written by Quentin Tarantino when he was at the beginning of his career and therefore at the top of his creativity, just after ""Reservoir Dogs"" and just before ""Pulp Fiction"" ."
814;The brilliance of dialogs and gags is stressed even more by the incredible casting.
815;True Romance is a true classic in many respects.
816;For one thing, it's one of the best films directed by the late Tony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott.
817;For another, it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best screenplays.
818;"But in the end, its greatest strength is the cast
819;chief among them is Christian Slater, who simply gives the performance of his life as pop.
820;Pitt is brilliant, offering comic relief to the film's hail of bullets and shotgun blasts.
821;One minute you're giddy with laughter, watching the proceedings here, and the next, you feel like you're careening downhill at 90 mph.Yes, the film is a thriller, but it's a thriller with considerable mind and heart.
822;And the heart of the film is, indeed, the subject of love itself.
823;There are some great lines that beg to be heard more than once, and some visual moments that are no less than overwhelming, including the final shoot.
824;This was probably a good flick when it first came out.
825;Hot Chica, cute guy, action packed and romance.
826;one of those one of a kind special projects that captures a moment in time that you can cherish and relive over and over again.
827;Another masterpiece from screenwriter Quentin Tarrantino ( Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) direcyed by Tony Scott ( The Last Boy Scout) True Rommance is a high.
828;thrilled rommantic tale with a auwsome cast ever to be put together.
829;this has to be one of the most Tarrantino production ever made even thogh It came out a year before Pulp Fiction and a year after Resevoir Dogs.
830;true Romance has more Hype to it and is enjoyable for beginging to end we will never see anything like this anymore.1# Reservoir Dogs2# True Romance3# Pulp Fiction
831;Even though Gary Oldman is only on screen less than 15 minutes, it is a great performance.
832;enjoyed performances by the late Dennis Hopper and James Gandolfini.
833;It was a good movie.
834;Like his other movies there is a good mix of suspense, action, and humor.
835;Only a few movies have actually gotten me to feel for the characters and feel like watching it again right after the first time.
836;Slater and Arquette made the perfect couple and when they each killed for the first time I was reeling.
837;star packed thriller that is sure to please.
838;This is film made Slater a star.
839;watch the alternate ending and you yourself will go.
840;When I first saw this movie my friend had invited me to watch it with him and his girlfriend.
841;I thought that because of the name that it was going to be some chick flick.
842;First you have Slater's charachter, a down to earth cat with a twist.
843;It's easy to identify with his easy lifestyle.
844;Then what realy hooks you is Alabama.
845;What seals this movie is the beating Alabama takes for her lover, an ordinary cat with an obssesion for Elvis.
846;This movie really has it all, and it's one of my absolute favorite movies of all time.
847;Great film alot of scenes added to it!!
848;I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
849;This movie comes a very close second to Pulp Fiction.
850;The fact is, it's great.
851;I was!Christian Slater is just so cute, although after being told he's practically using Jack Nicholson as his idol , I can totally see it now.
852;One thing that always gets me is guys with nice eyes.
853;But her Christian (I keep going to write Christina) make a cute couple.
854;But still very much enjoyable.
855;some of the scenes between Christian Patricia, are really sweet, especially after they first meet and end up in bed, and then they sit holding hands!
856;It's a terrific movie, with packs of extras, and loads of stars (Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer etc).
857;I am not a big action adventure shoot 'em up movie type or even Hollywood romance type, but this is really a nice movie for a wide variety of people.
858;such a good cast of stars such a great movie its a must see for anyone who hasn't seen it.
859;If you like Tarantino movies, I think you would enjoy this one.
860;but also the great dialogue.
861;There is a memorable scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.
862;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are very credible, and perform their roles beautifully.
863;makes you want to be Alabama.
864;makes you want to love like that.
865;this type of romance comes only once.
866;Great characters and great film!
867;I loved this movie because it was a good time.
868;Slater and Arquette worked great together.
869;I liked Gary Oldman's dreadlocked performance and his sorta gangster images and voice.
870;Dennis Hopper seems like a gentle kind of guy in this movie.
871;Christopher Walken is great as always and Samuel L. Jackson gets killed to quick.
872;true romance is true cool
873;I loved Patrica Arquette in this character and Bronson Pinchot is Hilarious.
874;True Romance has Quentin Tarantino's fingerprints all over it, although it was actually directed by Tony Scott.
875;hooks up with a prostitute, Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) with a heart of gold.
876;What could have been a traumatic experience for the both of them blossoms into a passionate romance.
877;unlike say, Pretty Woman, True Romance reminds us that being a prostitute is not fun.
878;Part of the unglamorous side of Alabama's life is her abusive pimp, Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman, fantastic as always).
879;Clarence also looks for help from his dad, Clifford (the always amusing Dennis Hopper).
880;The dialogue between Walken and Hopper is worth the price of admission alone.
881;It's about passion, the kind of passion that binds people together in ways they can't even understand: lovers (Clarence and Alabama), fandom (Clarence and Elvis), and even murder (Vincenzo and Clifford).
882;Our hero perseveres because he believes in the power of love and, once he finds it, will do anything to keep it alive.
883;It's that passion that propels the plot forward, such that even those who only peripherally experience the romance between Clarence and Alabama are willing to sacrifice everything for them.
884;But True Romance reserves its passion most for the love between father and son.
885;studded cast that actually lives up to expectations.
886;Don't be fooled: True Romance is as passionate and foul.
887;mouthed as anything Tarantino has written.
888;But it's a love letter to lovers, celebrating what brings out the best and worst in humanity.
889;watch it, if only to see two pros (Hopper and Walken) at the top of their game.
890;One of Tarantino's early scripts, 'True Romance' was further enhanced by Director Tony Scott's artistic touch.
891;Unbeknownst to them, the drugs really belong to a local, but powerful mob boss and the mayhem continues to build from there.
892;while not an Oscar winner, this film has gained a bit of a cult status and is also notable for furthering the careers of many of the cast members.
893;Watching Gandolfini's character in this, it is easy to spot the beginnings of what would become his Tony Soprano character in HBO's 'The Sopranos' Gary Oldman's rendition of the wild drug dealing pimp, Drexel, is also remarkable.
894;Christopher Walken is always a joy to watch, and he delivers a menacing performance here as a restrained, but ill tempered mob enforcer.
895;all, 'True Romance' is not your average love film, nor is it your average crime drama, but it manages to mix both of those with just the right amount of levity to make this worth watching if you want something other than the standard Hollywood fare.
896;all worth checking out if you enjoyed the movie.
897;I held my breathe every five minutes.
898;for many of the big names in this movie, it may have been their best career performance.
899;got me started on Tarantino with Pulp Fiction .
900;True Romance is an excellent story, and if you are a fellow old fart, you'll probably enjoy this is well.
901;I have been looking for this for a long time and am so happy that i finally have one of the best movies that christopher walken is in!!
902;Thinking that everything is fine, Alabama and Clarence get married and go out to Hollywood where they will attempt to sell the narcotics and start a new life with the money.
903;I have seen it many times since, and still consider it one of the best films to come out of the 90's.
904;Quentin Tarantino was the man behind the brilliant script that offers a classic tale of love and revenge.
905;The ending is absolutely outstanding, and provides for an overall enjoyable experience.
906;The cast is filled with outstanding actors that includes .
907;Every single one of them turns in a top notch performance.
908;True Romance offers a well rounded cast, and an outstanding love story filled with action, revenge, classic dialogue, and a great ending.
909;released with the Unrated Director's Cut 2 Disc Special Edition.
910;Yep, I said love story and it is.
911;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette's chemistry is perfect.
912;Special kudos go out to my fave, the very underrated actor Gary Oldman (the pimp), performing yet another perfect accent and another perfect character.
913;Overall, this film is worth seeing at least once.
914;They are both sober and they believe it's true romance, so they get married.
915;top crazy Gary Oldman), Clarence, courageous but not so smart, confronts him.
916;directed by Tony Scott, the film is full of brilliantly written and delivered small scenes.
917;In just a couple well written scenes, he's able to show his comedic side.
918;Preceding the great """"Pulp Fiction"""" by a year, """"True Romance"""" remains one of the best films of the genre."""
919;the Blu ray transfer is pretty good but not great.
920;I've always liked the Hans Zimmer soundtrack and it's even better here.
921;This is a great movie, but the more I watch Tarantino films the more scared I get of watching another one.
922;"This is one of my all time favorites
923;what else, oh yeah, Brad Pitt as the Honey Bear bong smokin' hippie as Soundgarden blasts in the background, Val Kilmer is the ghost of Elvis, Saul Rubinek oozes with Hollywood powermonging brilliance, Rappaport(Dick Ritchie), Pinchot, and many more make cameos.
924;It's got it all"
925;Nothing dramatic, just high voltage entertainment!
926;Still, this is one of my top ten of all time (favorites that is) enough said.
927;btu now after viewing this a second time, I am now convinced this is one of the greatest ever.
928;This should be an inspiration for anyone looking to write or even make movies one day.
929;I didn't hear any hi.ya's, but they beautifully captured the spirit of a old school kung fu flick on this one.
930;Cause they are absolutely shlt compared to this flick.
931;This movie is outstanding and depicts a situation where true love gets Clarence in trouble with a low.
932;"As a nearly 50 year old retired Air Force fighter pilot, I found ""True Romance"" to be one of my top 2 movies ever."
933;True Romance has always been one of my all time favorite movies.
934;This movie has everything suspense, drama, action, and comedy.
935;It's an excellent transfer in Blu Ray.

937;$$$$$$$$$(Calypso theme is infectious, and one of my faves.)
938;Be aware that this has some gruesome bloody scenes but the story is filled with love, the violence part is overlooked by the COOL attraction that these two discover within and ends like a fairytale.
939;One of my all time favorites.
940;True Romance is a perfect film.
941;totally nailed by director Tony Scott, with an absolutely amazing cast of classic characters, wonderful script by Quentin Tarantino, and just the best feelgood, violent action movie ever.
942;slater and Arquette are fantastic together as the lovesick couple on the run from the mob, and all their magic adventures along the way.
943;the Director's Cut (Two Disc Special Edition) includes lots of interesting extras, and is one of my favourite discs ever.
944;This is an amazing movie.
945;Buth they want to sell it and start their lives again somewhere nice.
946;Great original story and very gripping, nice chunk of action and an ending that'll blow you away and leave you wanting more and more and more.
947;as poignant as it is vengeful, and still achingly funny).
948;And to what is it pertaining.
949;It's not because of the script/screenplay, that was written by the great Quentin Tarantino, with all the trademark flourishes you'd expect, with witty dialogue and great set.
950;"Apart from the leads, Christian Slater and the wonderful Patricia Arquette (in undoubtedly their greatest screen performances), this movie has a cast list like a whose who of great screen actors
951;It also boasts a great cameo performance from Brad Pitt and a superb supporting performance from (the then not so famous) James Gandolfino.
952;this is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie.
953;Classic scenes indeed, particularly the one with Walken and Hopper.
954;It's hard to believe this movie was made back in 1993 because it's still as fresh, still as cool and still looks as enjoyable as it was back then.
955;I just love this movie and if you haven't seen it yet I hope you will too.
956;True Romance is a cult classic that bombed at the box office despite having a cast to die for.
957;Christian Slater delivers a career best performance and Patricia Arquette is dead sexy as his wife Alabama.
958;Written my Tarantino this film is one of my favorites and my favorites of his.
959;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are excellent in it, it's a fun, very 90's wild romp!
960;It'll make you want to go on a road trip and talk in a Southern accent.
961;This is Tarantino at his very best and if he didn't direct this one (he sold the script to pay for the making of Reservoir Dogs) it still displays his wonderful talent for creating a story.
962;tarantino is in love with dialogue and bless him for that"
963;This film is an outstanding example of that talent.
964;the cast list in this film is impressive to say the least.
965;Of the two main characters, Christian Slater is outstanding as Clarence Whirly, while Patricia Arquette shines as the dizzy Alabama.
966;It's smart, intelligent, funny, ever.
967;Someone told me they thought this was one of the most romantic movies of all time.
968;guys will like it that's for sure.
969;I have to agree the cast is superb.
970;I was really surprised at the gathering of wonderful talent in this movie.
971;I was surprised because the script is an odd choice for some of the greatness of the actors.
972;brad Pitt is a hoot!
973;There are some good laughs in this movie.
974;All around easy and efficient.
975;This was a great movie.
976;This movie, along with Natural Born Killers, are my favorite bedtime movies.
977;You see, he bought this ring for his sweetheart.
978;"The rest of the great cast includes Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot (who steals many a scene), Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, and Tom Sizemore in supporting roles
979;I like Quentin Tarantino movies, this was is great for the amount of unknown actors that were later starts in Hollywood.
980;Great characters great story and great director!
981;The Christopher Walken dialogue is enough to.
982;This is the ultimate movie lover's movie.
983;star cast and excellent acting.
984;Very engaging and interesting movie.
985;what I love about this film is that a lot of things happened and that made a movie explosive.
986;I'm a big Gary Oldman fan, and it's good to see him here as a Jamaican pimp.
987;Patricia is pretty as usual, better looking that her role in Lost Highway.
988;Brad Pitt does a respectable Jeff Spicoli.
989;This is such a great movie.
990;this movie is full of everything .
991;romance, humor, action, drugs, rock.
992;Christian Slater is great and Patricia Arquette is the cutest thing ever.
993;The movie is FULL of famous actors (those listed above plus Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer .
994;but T. r. is superb.
995;The dialog is fantastic and the acting, especially by Dennis Hopper, is some of the best ever.
996;The story is good, the humor is good, the acting is good, but the dialog is GREAT.
997;True Romance, a pure romance movie, albeit one with guns, violence, and pimps, succeeds on every level at breaking down such stereotypes.
998;You will leave this movie with a great sense of what true love is all about.
999;Action, suspense, drama, and many famous actors before they were famous.
1000;The movie was and kept surprising her at every turn.
1001;If you have not seen this movie you need to see it right now.
1002;just a fun movie overall.
1003;i recommend it as a must see movie to all of my friends, and i have yet to be disappointed.
1004;The Bottom Line:While no one will acuse True Romance of being art, it brings a well.
1005;speak and violence to the table and delivers an entertaining package"
1006;This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever watched.
1007;It's action packed from the very beginning to the end.
1008;It was a fun movie to watch.
1009;Plenty of action and violence to keep folks entertained.
1010;Good plot twists to keep the thinking people interested.
1011;the 'Trailer Scene with the Sicilian' is one of the best on film.
1012;Great directors cut version and the additional footage from the two disc edition.
1013;I enjoyed this movie and have for years.
1014;I love the dialogue and the cast was outstanding.
1015;All in all it was a fun ride.
1016;Fast, funny, great dialog, awesome cast.
1017;Tarantino's first screenplay, and a ridiculouis roster of stars and great actors.
1018;this is a gem of a movie, because it hasso many scenes of black humor, and intense, gratuitous violence and indulgence.
1019;"He should have just kept working at the comic store and lived happily ever after with Patricia Arquette's Alabama (interesting name for someone who ""is not Florida white trash"")."
1020;The perfect mix of action, romance, and thrills.
1021;Written by Tarantino, his style definitely comes through.
1022;This is his raw best.
1023;The best look into him.
1024;I loved it, and wish he'd write more like it.
1025;I recommend this to any action lover who doesn't mind a little love interest plot thrown in.
1026;some of the most classic lines said by some of the most classic movie stars ever!!!
1027;This movie is a real mix of action, romance and comedy but I think the key to it are some of the great cameos by people like Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer.
1028;i would recommend this movie to anyone !
1029;they could have done a much better job on this movie
1030;It's one of my top 5 of all time.
1031;time favorite movies, and in my opinion Quentin Tarantino's best.
1032;There are so many reasons why this is an excellent movie, but I don't want to rave on so I will try to summarize.
1033;patricia Arquette's performance in this movie is so amazing, very visceral and primal, as well as funny.
1034;I believe that this movie was her swan song, the best performance she has ever done.
1035;His characterization of Drexyl the wannabee black man is mesmerizing and primal.
1036;Then there is Brad Pitt's superb cameo as a pot head roomate, which is just hilarious.
1037;these are just the highlights, there are many, many more astounding performances and characters in this movie.
1038;coaster ride with real substance!
1039;"The best part was Patricia Arquette's performance as ""Alabama"" the call girl."
1040;She is a tough girl whose beautiful face and figure are not hardly damaged after a violent assault scene by one of the bad guys.
1041;The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes.
1042;Twist turner ending, and the fact that it WAS the end.
1043;Sorry I bought this as a gift for the hubby.
1044;This is the best film ever made by Tony Scott.
1045;Actually this ain`t much of a special film but it helped to launch Tarantinos career.
1046;"His trademark , this so called ""machine."
1047;I feel that the keys to success in this film are the acting and script.
1048;The film serves as a black comedy, an exciting action flick, and a thrilling crime caper.
1049;It has some great singular roles as well.
1050;Brad Pitt is hilarious as stoner Floyd, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the anti.
1051;the writing is hilarious and rich with thoughtful dialogue.
1052;Great flick, and fun for a Saturday afternoon.
1053;It is definitely worth the money.
1054;**I remember seeing this film in a small theater in Los Angeles when I was about 10 years old.
1055;the performances by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette easily carry the film, and although I am not a sucker for love stories, I could not help but root for characters of Clarence and Alabama.
1056;Subsequent appearances by Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, while small, are breathtaking pieces of filmmaking.
1057;Quentin Tarantino has carved out a unique niche over the course of his career, and his ability to develop characters and utilize dialog to grab the viewer by the seat of his pants and not let go is displayed with perfection in this film.
1058;tony Scott, famous for Crimson Tide, Top Gun, Domino, and Man on Fire, does an excellent job of capturing the characters and distilling breathtaking performances out of the actors.
1059;In traditional Tarantino fashion, the movie contains an epic Mexican Standoff toward the end.
1060;The alternate ending is also spectacular and is more true.
1061;in conclusion, this movie is absolutely great.
1062;Fans of Quentin Taranino must see this film.
1063;Watch it for a first, second, and third time, and then watch it with commentary.
1064;I dont write many reviews, and give almost no 5 star endorsements, but I feel that it is necessary for True Romance, as it is definitely one of the top 10 movies I have ever seen, and I consider myself a tough crowd and well.
1065;The movie itself is great, with an unbelievable cast, clever dialogue and memorable characters (particularly Gary Oldman's).
1066;ray edition is highly recommended.
1067;All I knew was that it absolutely knocked my socks off!
1068;A good story line, great dialog and a ballsy overall attitude made it almost mesmerising the first time through.
1069;Slater has never been better, Brad Pitt is a hoot, and the scene with Walken and Hopper is scary/moving/terrific.
1070;And that's not even taking into account all the other great performances in the film.
1071;Many people had it on their top 20 lists.
1072;So I watched the film, and was amused by the duality of the story.
1073;This is all executed with classical, Tarantino style dialogue.
1074;The characters are funny, interesting, and most importantly, likeable.
1075;A pimp is involved, along with a suitcase full of cocaine.
1076;Along the way, there are a few interesting cameos: Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share the best scene of the movie.
1077;Val Kilmer is very good as Elvis.
1078;Yes, it's Tarantino's favorite: A Mexican Standoff.
1079;I would have been happy to let this sleeping dog lie, but I noticed a commentary track with Tarantino.
1080;That track is classic and hilarious.
1081;I explored the rest of the special features, and found that they were all very good.
1082;This is one of my favorites with unforgetable characters.
1083;This is Quetin's best script.
1084;Also, there's something about a hot blonde and a downtrodden guy who loves comic books.
1085;Tarantino proves once again why he's a genius.
1086;Patricia Arquette is incredibly hot in this picture.
1087;Very good all around cast.
1088;quentin tarantino really knows how to ruin something potentially good.
1089;Loved it for both a romance story and a drama!!!
1090;Wow, it really keeps you on your seat for the next move!
1091;This is a great movie.
1092;terreffic action film great cast of characters many stars RIP dennis weaver real life believe it and as 2 the movie start 2 end it is a great high interest movie start 2 finish
1093;this is a fantasy adventure.
1094;written by Quentin Tarantino, if you like his other films you will like this one.
1095;The casting alone tells you that this movie is going to have an impact you will never forget.
1096;One of my favorite movies of all time!
1097;Tony Scott directs and he knows his way around an action movie.
1098;But the core is pure Tarantino and the ensemble cast is to die for.
1099;Wild and unpredictable it's a thrill ride to the very end.
1100;ray looks great and the sound is even better.
1101;The scene is absoulutely riveting and Walken gives his best performance ever, in true Walken style, only to be matched by Hopper.
1102;The movie is a 4 star at best, but this scene makes the movie a classic.
1103;This movie even makes Christian Slater look good.
1104;Director Tony Scott shows what it takes for those who have found True Love.
1105;This is a great film that proves it exists, but it requires a lot of violence to do it.
1106;cynics keep telling me that True Love exists only in the hearts of Hopeless Dreamers.
1107;right?From the first frame to the last, this film is unadulterated fun, very well done by an outstanding cast that includes Dennis Hopper and Val Kilmer.
1108;If you haven't seen it, be sure to do so.you'll love it.
1109;If you've seen it before, see it again.
1110;True Romance is one of Tony Scott's best films, along with Crimson Tide and The Last Boy Scout.
1111;The film screams with one of the greatest casts ever assembled.
1112;The film is just FUN!
1113;That is a line in the movie by Arquette that can sum up this film.
1114;banter between Michael Rappaport and Brad Pitt is hilarious.
1115;And everyone and their mothers are in this movie.
1116;awful transfers of favorite films.
1117;Brad Pitt was never better!
1118;Sort of like Reservoir Dogs and Foxey Brown, but totally unique on it's own.
1119;more unexpected is a happy ending.
1120;full of action and suspence.
1121;a typical, and one of the best Tarantino screen plays.
1122;Tony Scott does a great job of directing.
1123;The confrontations between: Christian Slater vs. Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper vs. Chris Walken, Rosanna Arquette vs. James Gandolfini, are terrific.
1124;Includes brad pitt b4 he was famous, small role but played it perfectly.
1125;All star cast, each perfect for the part.
1126;Lots of cussing, blood and action but has mellow moments also.
1127;Today i consider this movie nostalgic in a very good way.
1128;Good acting with a lot of star power and a well written and directed movie.
1129;Not much to say about this, it deserves to be watched about 10 times, it certainly is well cinematogrpahed and stylishly memorable in a early to mid 90's way.
1130;In turns memorable, cruel, decadent, funny, charismatic and distastefull, it stays in the mind, not that it really deserves to though
1131;i'm very happy with the service.
1132;This was a gift to myself I really enjoyed this movie .
1133;Thank you for sending it before a Fathers Day
1134;This movie also had a huge plot behind it.
1135;Along with the great cast above, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn and more.
1136;The dialogue alone in this movie is worth the price.
1137;Add in the most epic Christopher Walken scene ever and you got a masterpeice.
1138;Dont let the title fool you, this is a great guy movie!
1139;ups of the actors, again and again.
1140;Any review I write for this is totally biased since this is one of my favorite movies.
1141;So yeah, I could go on and on about this film but suffice it to say: the movie is so good I tattooed it on myself.
1142;Every performance is sensational, brilliant cast, brilliant lines, I loved it.
1143;give it a try,then if you like it tell a friend.
1144;The cast reads like a who's who of the genre, and Patricia Arquette turns in a great performance.
1145;Simply put: this movie rocks!!!
1146;Everyone in it is absolutely awesome.
1147;It definitely keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.
1148;This movie was suggested to me by a girl I worked with, she said it was her favorite movie of all time.
1149;Needless to say I watched it the first time with a huge amount of skeptisism.
1150;This movie is beautifully written!
1151;Pay close attention to all the stars in this movie, they knew it was a good investment so should you.
1152;so many stars, action, comedy, romance and some damn good ass kicking scenes.
1153;This movie is an unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.
1154;Gary Oldman is great as the inner.
1155;In addition to being packed with action and great dialogue, this movie contains two of the best scenes ever made in Hollywood.
1156;The first is an intense showdown between Clarence (Slater) and Drexel (Oldman) as Clarence shows up at Drexel's place to retrieve his newlywed bride Alabama's (Arquette) things.
1157;"He's packing heat because of a conversation he had with ""Elvis"" in his bathroom."
1158;This scene will leave you stupified.
1159;Walken introduces himself to Hopper in classic Tarantino style .
1160;It kept him happy over the holidays.
1161;Made a nice Christmas gift and easy to package and ship overseas.
1162;The movie has moments that feel like you are watching Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, which thus give you a glimmer of hope for something worthwhile to come, but that bit comes in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie when the plot finally begins .
1163;cool dialogue that carries the sophistication of your mama jibes (literally.)
1164;Thank you, have a nice day.
1165;This movie is chock full of all the American pop.
1166;It also has some of the best and oddest performances of pretty much everyone involved: Val Kilmer (as Elvis mentioned above), Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ultimately wise but washed.
1167;"out security guard father living in a trailer by the railroad tracks, Brad Pitt has a great small role as ""Floyd"" the good."
1168;"natured stoner (another one of his great ""grimy"" characters), James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) makes what might be his film debut(?)"
1169;man, Gary Oldman is perfect as the gloriously pimped.
1170;"Throw all this together with the pacing and camera work of ""Top Gun"" (thanks to director Tony Scott) and the typically."
1171;"brilliant script provided by Tarantino, and that is why I would tentatively nominate ""True Romance"" as my ""Best American Movie of the early.90s""."
1172;p. s. some other great performers that I didn't get a chance to mention in my review, and that make this movie as entertaining as it is, are: Christopher Walken as a chilling Mafia.
1173;"zealous narc squad partners, and Bronson Pinchot is a wonderfully whiny ""go."
1174;This is a great movie!
1175;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1176;Gritty, witty, packed with awesome actors.
1177;This scene is fantastic film.
1178;making, and of course ultimately it is Quentin Tarantinos brilliant writing that makes it work.
1179;There is a lot of swearing as well, and whilst it isn't as good as Pulp Fiction it certainly is a classic 'popcorn' movie.
1180;I ordered this for a friend.
1181;Seen this movie multiple times and its a good one worth watching.
1182;In my opinion, good to watch with a gf/bf as well as it has lots for everyone.
1183;Am I ever glad that I did.
1184;I almost gave it a 5 anyways since the movie is so good.
1185;Ordered this for a friend, and she loves it!
1186;Thanks Amazon for a great movie!
1187;Tarantino's dialogue has a distinct feel.
1188;I find it very funny and I love it.
1189;There are excellent moments and some not so good.
1190;slater does pretty well as Clarence.
1191;Arquette's Alabama is an essential character and their relationship works.
1192;the best scene in the movie is where Christopher Walken's character interrogates Hopper's.
1193;it's full of star power with big name actors playing tiny roles.
1194;The basic plot is very simple and could be summarized in a single paragraph, but this is more about the journey.
1195;humor, a Mexican standoff, blood, bizarre dialogue, it's all there.
1196;I know I can order but this is one of the top dozen that MUST be owned!Hot chick!
1197;we both loved it a read watch highly recommended
1198;I love QT, I mean, he's my hero, but in this case I really think that Tony Scott did a good job for the ending.
1199;The perfect cast for a great movie.
1200;This is my favorite movie.
1201;The cast is great, the writing is great, the story is great.
1202;seriously, this movie has it all.
1203;Also, it was very nice that it arrived in two days!
1204;Blu Ray was a great price.
1205;This is the best example of Quentin Tarantino's art, a brew of deliciously violent action, amoral characters, farcical situations and extremely eloquent exchanges.
1206;It includes bravura performances from Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt and .
1207;What do you have when you mix a phenomenal cast with one of the best action screenplays of all time????
1208;one of my greatest regrets is that I can never again see this movie for the first time.
1209;It is electrifying, hysterically funny, intense, gory, and above all entertaining from start to finish.
1210;or both, and the final shootout ranks among the greatest of all time.
1211;It is not nearly as famous as Pulp Fiction, but I think it is as good in many ways, and is an absolute must.
1212;see for all Tarantino fans.
1213;hot, nasty, shrewd, tough as nails, and (most importantly) absolutely loyal to her man.
1214;clarence (Christian Slater) proves to be a quick study when it comes to mayhem and revenge.
1215;the rest of the stars, from Christopher Walken to Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt to Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore to Val Kilmer, etc. etc. all give wonderful performances because they have the benefit of some of the greatest situations and scintillating dialog in their careers.
1216;Believe me the enjoyment is contagious.you will LOVE True Romance.
1217;"When friends come over for movie night, the first thing I always ask them is
1218;It is Tony Scott's masterpiece, and the best thing Quentin ever wrote.
1219;So many memorable lines to add to the pop culture.
1220;And am still amazed at how unknown this film is to movie fans!
1221;Tony Scott will always be remembered as a high octane film maker.
1222;Thanks for the wild ride Tony, may you rest in peace.
1223;It serves as a metaphor to an emotional roller coaster of the mind, body and soul.
1224;True Romance is a tough, graphic look at .
1225;love and how everyone gets one shot at love and what happens if you blow it.
1226;That's putting it in simple lamemans terms but it's the foundation to this brilliant film.
1227;There was something magical going on when they made this movie, and no other film has ever come close to topping this one.
1228;This film has it all.
1229;This movie has it all: a really touching love story, very cool twisted situations, really cool action ( this comes from an non .
1230;and even fantastic gore scenes.
1231;This is without a doubt the best movie Quentin Tarantino ever wrote.
1232;and that's because of the great romance scenes that are really touching.
1233;Another fine element is Tarantino's black humor like the sicilian story Dennis Hopper's telling Christopher Walken.
1234;As with all of his movies, it was great.
1235;One of the most underrated films in the last 20 years.
1236;The film has the best casting of any film in recent memory.
1237;My top three best flicks of all time!
1238;just a blast to watch.
1239;After the first three scripts (this, Reservoir dogs, and Pulp Fiction) Tarantino is sometimes entertaining, always clever, duff, but this film is high art.
1240;some people say that """"True Romance"""" takes a while to warm up, but I prefer the beginning."""
1241;After it arrives in Hollywood and becomes an action film, it is still excellent, but in inception it is perfection.
1242;And this film shows use the sort of dream that might.
1243;"But, the tragic beauty of ""True Romance"" is that, unlike the genre it parodies, it is self."
1244;the emphasis is on dream.
1245;outs, hangs in my mind as theme for this movie: unfulfillable hope.
1246;the music, and this film, crystalise the unearthly hope of those out in the cold, comic.
1247;She is a call girl that is paid to be there.
1248;they hold on to the dream.
1249;And the scenes are very, very cool.
1250;True Romance is full of monologues.
1251;are redefining cool all the way.
1252;is just that, Clarence and Alabama's fantastic journey from Detroit to Hollywood never touches down.
1253;I agree with those that say that it is *one of the best movies ever made*.
1254;This is such a great movie.
1255;kubrik2899 saysQuentin Tarantio struck all the right notes when he wrote this fantastic motion picture, which, in my opinion, is the greatest motion picture of all time.
1256;There are lots more, please read the reviews.
1257;This movie shows us what we want, and that it is unatainable.
1258;But at the same time, this movie tells shows us that the dream is bigger and more powerful than the truth.
1259;Great condition, great movie and quick delivery!
1260;Just like Pulp Fiction and Resevior Dogs, True Romance keeps you in your seat the entire movie and offers a great variety of violence and crime.
1261;This two disc version of True Romance is excellent.
1262;i found the bonus info.
1263;, as entertaining as the film itself.
1264;but it was well worth the investment.
1265;I love it when you can pick a scene , and while you choose , the pictures are moving in the little boxes.
1266;The movie itself , is spellbinding.
1267;But it's what happens in the middle of that basic plotline, that the excitement lies.
1268;Excellent dialog , creative action sequences, fantastic actors, nice budget , and enough directorial insight.
1269;to allow Brad Pitt the freedom,to steal his scenes , as Floyd, are the reasons why I love this movie.
1270;it's definately worth the money.
1271;One of most underrated classics of the '90s .
1272;hell, one of the most underrated classics of all time.
1273;Back when Quentin Tarantino could write clever, quotable dialogue that didn't put you to sleep (Death Proof, Inglorious Basterds) this is an unaplogetic guilty pleasure.
1274;Unforgettable characters, funny scene after funny scene balanced with scary confrontations and explosive action.
1275;famous actors took tiny parts shows you that a great script will attract great talent.
1276;by far the best thing Tony Scott's ever done or ever will do.
1277;Just an all around damn good movie with more up and coming stars and power hitters than you can shake a stick at!
1278;I didnt know it was written by Tarantino, which explains why the dialog is so good!This will always be one of my favorite movies .
1279;romance, violence, love, violence, sex, violence, intrigue, plot twists, witty banter.
1280;everything!If you like dark humor (and Elvis) you MUST see this movie!
1281;With Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and last, but not least, the late James Gandolfini, written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by the late Tony Scott, this is one of the best cult films I have seen.
1282;The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is amazing.
1283;If you love Quintin Tarantino's movies, you will love this.
1284;An action packed ride from beginning to end with wonderful humor to lighten the intensity.
1285;I have seen it three times and still love it.
1286;it's a very good transfer, in fact, I'd bet it's the best this movie is gonna look (at least until the next format and mayebe even not).
1287;Comparing to the old version, this transfer is great.
1288;excellent audio, you have audio stereo and dts.
1289;the more interesting being of course the one by Quentin Tarantino.
1290;it has a few extras on the disc two, very interesting and the movie version is a Director's Cut.
1291;all in all, this is the best edition of this movie so far.
1292;I remember the first time I watched this movie .
1293;"I was actually quite happy about it as I don't particular like his directing style, but I do like his ""writing skills""."
1294;Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette star in this action packed bloody dark comedy, and although they did a pretty good job, I can't give them all the credit.
1295;The supporting cast is outstanding.
1296;He's only in this film briefly but he's great.
1297;And I can't overlook the gorgeous and sweet Patricia Arquette, who is marvelously cast here.
1298;Tony Scott directed and again it's a very slick.
1299;This special edition is terrific with multiple commentaries and an interesting alternate ending.
1300;worthy films of the past ten years is A. i.: Artificial Intelligence.
1301;But after Speilberg took over for the late Kubrick and picked up the film, A. i. became the most interesting collaboration in recent history, and to date is the most unconventional film of Speilberg and the most populist of Kubrick.
1302;true Romance follows Clarence, a comic book store employee with a fascination for Elvis and Kung Fu, and his new bride Alabama, a former call girl who takes pride in only turning three tricks.
1303;With mafiosos on their tall and the police closing in on them, the film climaxes with Taratino's favorite device, the Mexican Stand.
1304;In addition, the principle cast features solid stars like Christian Slater, Rosanna Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Michael Rappaport and Christopher Walken doing what Christopher Walken does: walk into a movie, spend five minutes on screen and create a moment that no viewer will forget.
1305;the earmarkings of Tarantino are everywhere: the long monologues, the super cool criminals and the references to Kung Fu, Elvis and comic books.
1306;But Tony Scott creates a film from the original script that will be enjoyed by many folks turned off by Tarantino's avaunt gaurde form of directing.
1307;Rather, Scott does with this script what he does with most of his films: he makes a conventional film with a happy ending that most people will understand.
1308;At the very least, this is a lesson in collaboration.
1309;this film has a considerable number of actors who later went on to do bigger and better things.
1310;special note: Gary Oldman is the best part of this movie, he owned his moment.
1311;Say what you will about Quentin Tarantino, he deserves credit for one thing: his work has consistently managed to illuminate a side of American life that most of us can scarcely imagine.
1312;life Tarantino's depiction of life on the other side of the law is, it always makes for some thrilling viewing.
1313;think True Romance, written by Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott, a romantic movie for guys who don't like romantic movies.
1314;industrial decay before moving on to the morally decayed world of Hollywood.
1315;That said, at bottom True Romance is about love, and the wild.
1316;sure, this is a bizarre, unconventional, and subversive love story, but it's a love story just the same, which is a large part of the movie's enduring appeal.
1317;of course, this is also a love story written by Quentin Tarantino, so you can expect to see plenty of wacky characters and twisted happenings, and True Romance doesn't disappoint in this regard.
1318;While it was written before the release of Pulp Fiction made him American cinema's unofficial arbiter of cool, this movie showcases his signature style in all its fast.
1319;Fittingly, Scott directs with a manic intensity and efficiency that keeps things moving along briskly, and with this unrated director's cut (perhaps the best three words in the English language), you get to see the film's ample bloodshed in even more unflinching brutality.
1320;it all starts with the meeting of the aforementioned comic.
