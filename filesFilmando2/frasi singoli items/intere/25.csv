1;The score, being made up of mostly Mozart's own music, adds even more to this delightful film.
2;Aside from the many factual inaccuracies, I enjoyed this film!
3;The opera scenes are breathtaking, and that casting was very well done.
4;Salieri was played out well, calm, cool, but always plotting, and Mozart and his bufoonish laugh.
5;it really brought out the point that genius can be held in the most unlikely places.
6;By far one of the greatest movies ever made.
7;Where do I begin?The plot is extraordinary and very engaging from the first few minutes.
8;The acting is 100% genius from both Abraham and Hulce.
9;Abraham is devilish while retaining a certain charm and evident shrewness.
10;Spectacular, clearly the best costumes, set, and photography are the best I've seen.
11;even the supporting actors and acctesses, albeit unknown at the time, do a wonderful job of perfectly fitting the story with nuances and humor that complete the Best Movie Award Oscar that it received.
12;But honestly, even if you don't enjoy Mozart's music, the storyline is enough to keep you captivated.
13;Abraham deserved the Oscar and then some for his portrayel of a young and old Saleri.
14;Everyone here has said their piece, and with the exception of a few, I believe for me to add anything about how fabulous it is would seem, well, superfulous!This movie is one of the best EVER made, a true artistic masterpiece!
15;It captures Mozart's legacy, while also providing a look at the more harrowing aspects of being a composer.
16;If you've ever wondered what Mozart was like you've got to see this film.
17;The movie is filled with Mozarts music and the acting is great.
18;This film is a masterpiece both of the cinema and of music.
19;Mozart is the archetype of the composer and musician who transforms, every so often, the field of music by going beyond all canons and rules, or even regulations.
20;He is the archetype of any creative person, in any field, who needs freedom to invent new vistas and perspectives, who needs tolerance and goodwill to be able to present to society what he is creating, to bring to the market and the public what he is inventing.
21;Mozart is like a God of our western civilization.
22;wagging and all his eye.
23;The third one is the official composer of the court who will do all he can to destroy this young man who is pushing him into oblivion and non.
24;This public is a caricature of taste and artistic feeling.
25;Luckily there is another public, the popular public, who is responsive to innovation, to beauty, to entertainment, to anything that is new and changes their way of looking at things.
26;but this film is also a phenomenal Requiem to Mozart who will be buried in a hemp.
27;This is a great movie.
28;This movie is by non means a biography of W. A. Mozart, but it does focus around his life.
29;Amadeus is a very wonderful and very entertaining film.
30;It is a must see for all.
31;This is an absolute great film.
32;The music of Mozart is among the best classical music in history.
33;He geniusly befriends Mozart and the mind games begin.
34;A tragic end to one of the world's best and beloved composers.
35;This is an awesome movie!
36;Full of masterful music, and awesome performances.
37;rather, this is a bit of a fantasy retelling of the life and times of a brilliant composer.
38;The film is hypnotic in the images produced, and the Mozart music is enthralling.
39;And we must bear in mind that this portrayal is undoubtedly an injustice to the historical Salieri.
40;This is much more of a what if than a realistic picture.
41;that in mind, this is a picture to be savored, to be enjoyed.
42;It is movies like this that make kids interested in history.
43;The more I see of it, the more subtle it becomes.
44;I'm beginning to think Jones did a sneaky circle around his director, despite the script, and brought out some very intelligent qualities in a man who managed to hang onto his own power in the days when France was being swept by civil unrest.
45;Even the sarcasm was beautifully underlined by appropriately chosen material.
46;"I don't think it was remastered all that well
47;Milos Forman brings together a great film about a Great Artist Mozart.
48;the Humor Music are as timeless as the film.
49;i really enjoy this film alot.
50;This is both a dramatic and comedic movie.
51;Wonderful from start to finish with great performances, cinematography, a witty script and original music by Mozart.
52;Mozart was a genius and his mind worked like no other composer.
53;He was also quite difficult, as great minds sometimes are.
54;amadeus the movie combines humor, the amazing story of this brilliant composer, darkness, sorrow, and the life of Mozart creating a fantastic film.
55;The music of course is so incredible, and the story behind it is something that you should not miss out on seeing.
56;As it turned out, this movie was as good as advertised, and even more so.
57;ran composer has for Mozart, which contrasts sharply to his absolute love of the genius's talent and music.
58;Although I doubt it is even close to being historically accurate, it is a great fictional story and the music is wonderful.
59;Add to that, a worthy oscar.
60;winning performance by E. Murray Abraham, fine performances by the entire cast, and one is left with a film that can be enjoyed over and over.
61;Between 1 and 10, Amadeus gets a solid 9.
62;Im taking serious thoughts to vote this film as the best film ever.
63;See it if you like, but I can't promise you'll be impressed.
64;Mozart was a pure genius and a gift from god.
65;Although the film is not completely accurate, it still is wonderful.
66;It is something that we all can relate to, myself included.
67;Amadeus is an epic biography about a man(i. e. Mozart), but is really a story of the man behind the name of Amadeus.
68;takingly beautiful film filled with rich colors, costumes, sets, lighting (or the little bit of it, anyway) and the characters that make this an instant classic.
69;award winning play), and Actor (Abraham, who beat out fellow nominee Tom Hulce as Mozart).
70;The remaining cast also help a great deal: Simon Callow as the actor friend of Mozart"
71;But despite those mistakes, the film is wonderful, exciting, moving, spiritual, uplifting, and depressing.
72;winning One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975, outdoes himself yet again.
73;A film with classical music and drama .
74;Prissy little boyBlessed with a gift of geniusMakes F. Murray mad!
75;Mozart was very lucky in this respect as his father found the ability in him, right from very young age and made use of his son for live.
76;His hardwork, love and passion for the music enabled him to attain a position of a court composer.
77;At no point does Salieri realises that his struggle and his success as a court composer involved the help of God.
78;There are times in the movie that Emperor Joseph praises Salieri's work.
79;He knew that his composition was no match to Mozart's as Mozart's music depicted the brilliance, beauty and the grace though people never really enjoyed or understood all his compostions.
80;On the other hand Antonio Salieri had a decent, regular life.
81;So better be happy with our God given gifts.
82;Mozart's personality, with his scatalogical sense of humor, had put me off the movie to a large extent on first viewing it.
83;I now feel affection for Mozart as portrayed in the movie, especially in the later part of his life.
84;The beauty of Mozart's music wonderfully permeates the scenic beauty of the story throughout, making this movie pleasurable to watch and especially to listen to.
85;this time around, I found myself drawn above all into Mozart's deathbed scene which fascinated me for several reasons.
86;The process of music writing between Mozart and Salieri was very interesting, and I wondered if that would have been a true picture of how any music could have been written collaboratively.
87;The truly penitent, guileless, and candid plea of forgiveness from Mozart is being offered to a confirmed Snake.
88;I find Mozart's greater interest in the Music than in Hell to be fairly delightful, but also seriously remiss given the gravity of the situation.
89;"(I feel an ""Oh, Thank You"" to the story."
90;"There's a lot of attention given to the concept of God's ""favor"" and who deserves to get it."
91;The way I interpret it, Mozart has the last word in the story, the last LAUGH, and it sounds, as always, so characteristically like an IDIOT'S laugh!Well, so, I think about the fact that God placed the genius gift of sublimely beautiful music.
92;All mysterious gifts and circumstances to ponder.
93;The film 'Amadeaus' is a prime example of how a completely fabricated story can pass off as something genuine.
94;Hollywood will anyting to create mystery out of nothing.
95;I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival.
96;Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious.
97;Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time.
98;for such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things.
99;It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart.
100;All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good!
101;I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance.
102;As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey.
103;A great example of a descent biography movie.
104;It's funny and interesting and at the same time so informative and dramatical.
105;Both of them are true works of art, belive it or not.
106;If you like a true descent movie masterpiece.
107;It is one of those rare movies that is both frolicking fun and an epic classic.
108;How much of the movie is true or revisionism doesn't matter as much as how they use true elements to frame the enigma of Mozart's persona and genius.
109;so absorbing is the story.
110;Amadeus is reckless and playful.
111;Solieri, an admirer of Mozart, has a big hand to play, for he is in charge of all the court music.
112;'Amadeus' encompasses the genius of its subject matter.
113;With eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Abraham, it is one of the greatest films assembled.
114;Neville Mariner's score makes the whole experience worthwhile by itself.
115;Elizabeth Berridge's portrayal as Mozart's wife yields are sympathy, and Tom Hulce makes the whole affair an entertaining romp.
116;Even the priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.
117;five years, 'Amadeus' is an untarnished jewel for the eyes, ears, and heart.
118;How can you strangle the same talent you consider divine?Salieri says it very well, And now the madness began in me.
119;This is a masterpiece about the dilemma of hating what you love!
120;Salieri summarizes his rise in the music world until he reached the top, and then the story kicks in right when Mozart started bumping him on the road to immortality!
121;He had the wealth, the looks, the charms, and respect.
122;He had it all but the superior talent!
123;He was okay, but not remarkable!
124;He thought that he had all that he ever wanted, until he met Mozart!
125;Salieri, driven by envy, decides to fight.
126;He's fighting god because he didn't give him the talent, but he gave him the ability to see it!
127;He saw in his clash with Mozart the chance to take revenge from god!I can find no words to explain how great this movie is.
128;I'm not a fan of opera, but I do enjoy classical music, only the really good ones though.
129;The utilization of Mozart's music in the movie is astonishing!
130;Mozart's talent is very well demonstrated throughout the movie.
131;And then, suddenly high above it, an oboe.
132;Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.
133;Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.
134;I ordered this movie a few months ago for my boyfriend and received it speedily.
135;I liked this move a ton when I was younger, in re.
136;watching it I was pleased to know how it holds up.
137;Despite its length, it keeps you engaged.
138;Behold, the greatest musical in film history ever made, with one of the best portrayals of envy within man, and the universal brooding music of Mozart, the man and his madness.
139;Brilliant and delicate, with touches of dramatic human confabulation, along with a masterful dominion of the image and sound, convey is: truly, madly, humorous kinky, tenderly deeply.
140;Released in 1984 and winner of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Milos Forman), and Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Amadeus belongs to the other kind of musical that doesn't uses the music to tell a story, instead it tells a story about Music, this time it happens to be the story of one of the highest enlightened Geniuses of all human history, Salzburg's precocious composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756.1791).
141;the truth of authenticity, the music behind the man, and the man behind the music.
142;a perfect transcendent screenplay, Milos Forman uncannily composes all the necessary elements in their right space and tone, the cast (perfectly chosen) become the faces of the factual historic characters (you'll never take apart Tom Hulce's face from the real Mozart), the already legendary performance by F. Murray Abraham, compels the virginal side of the purest love for music, along with the filthy tremors of the envious ways, Salieri is shown at is fullest human emotions, a magnificent reference work.
143;All his music sings and conveys a felling of ease, grace, and spontaneity as well as balance, restraint, and proportion.
144;Yet mysterious harmonies contrast with its lyricism, and it fuses elegance with power.
145;This interpretation of what may have happened during Mozart's life due to a rivalry Sollieri may have had makes for a long and entertaining evening.
146;It is intrigue deluxe surrounded by the lush music of the Classical period.
147;It is a true classic and ingenious fusion of music, spectacle, intrigue, performance, and directorial vision.
148;For this, the timid souls of the MPAA served up a new 'R rating.'
149;The added footage is a great highlight and does not diminish this phenomenal film, rather it enhances key plot points.
150;'Amadeus,' just like Mozart's music, is masterful and unique.
151;See it, then see it again.
152;"Great casting of characters
153;Great perfimances &, of course, the perfect score.
154;I recognized Amadeus as a masterpiece when I first saw it in its original theatrical release.
155;When the film came to VHS, I bought it immediately.
156;featured widescreen version of the film.
157;accurate portrayal of both Mozart and Salieri.
158;After all, Hollywood has never truly told a """"true story"""" without some embellishment."""
159;"with that out of the way, I can honestly say that ""Amadeus"" (Best Picture Oscar winner) is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
160;It is also one of those rare movies that just get better and better with each viewing.
161;but Mozart was more than a musical genius.
162;the second story is about Antonio Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham, who won a Best Actor Oscar for this movie), a fairly gifted composer who so longed to leave a lasting impression on the world with his music.
163;He believed that God had given him this desire, and the first time he met Mozart he knew that God had not given him the gift to match the desire.
164;salieri would eventually become awed by, envious of, and jealous of Mozart all at the same time.
165;He also wants God to accept the blame for giving Salieri the desire to make beautiful music, but giving Mozart the ability to do so.
166;f. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is perfectly understated and sublimely subtle.
167;You can see the insanity take root and, eventually, take over Salieri, all from the tiniest movements in Abraham's face, eyes, and hands.
168;You can see the music that Salieri sees in his head, and you can tell that Salieri has no way of releasing that music for the world to hear.
169;There is no question that Abraham deserved the Best Actor Oscar for this movie.
170;All throughout the movie, various Mozart and Salieri scores can be heard.
171;The music was a perfect match throughout the entire movie.
172;"f. Murray Abraham is marvelous portraying Salieri's pride and envy, and having to suffer the indignity of mediocrity
173;others in the cast of note are Elizabeth Berridge, excellent as Mozart's wife Constanza, and Roy Dotrice as his stern father Leopold.
174;the biggest star of the film however, is the music.
175;the glorious sounds of Mozart's operas, and his magnificent Requiem.
176;twyla Tharp's choreography is fresh and exhilarating, Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography is exquisite, and Milos Forman's direction imaginative and well paced.
177;as well as Best Actor, the Academy bestowed Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound, all well deserved.
178;Best 3 hrs of your life.
179;Occasionally there are Oscar winning films that actually deserve all the honors bestowed upon them.
180;Amadeus is one such movie.
181;Beethoven was really the firts great musical star or artist in the modern sense.
182;Salieri's music was popular during his lifetime but the movie does a good job of showing how unpopular it would become later when compared to Mozart.
183;The movie is also excellent at using the music, which is not merely background but is featured as a star.
184;salieri's reminiscing of performance s and the cuts into the music are the movie's strongest technical feature.
185;But, visually the film also offers beautiful scenes from orgiastic parties with foods that made my mouth water to idyllic palace scenes .
186;Hope he'll do better next time!
187;I love the music in this movie and im in love with Tom Hulce in this movie.
188;Tom Hulce and F. murray Abraham were great!
189;An urban legend from Vienna brought to the screen in such an intriguing way told through the eyes of the villain.
190;The music was wonderful, the movie fast moving.
191;This is a very adult movie with under the radar relationships, emotions and deceptions.
192;i really was impressed with the period details in every scene.
193;The acting is very good and moves one to tears.
194;Even my stoic 15 year old son finds the movie to be engaging and moving.
195;I think it is also a decent portrayal Amadeus Mozart's life.
196;BUT, the music is beautiful, and the context that the screenplay provides for the music (whether literally true or now) adds to the impact of the music.
197;Regardless of the historically accuracies (or lack thereof), this is one of the most compelling movies of our time.
198;The music, the characters, the scenery, the costumes.
199;this is one of my favorite movies.
200;won academy awards as it should have and is a timeless movie.
201;one of my favorite movies ever.
202;This is the incredible, mostly true story about the relationship between two composers in 18th century Vienna.
203;The film is presented in the Director's Cut, which features about 20 extra minutes of footage from the theatrical release.
204;Their music may seem high.
205;brow by contemporary standards, but back in the 18th and 19th centuries, popular classical composers were the rock stars of their day, often achieving great wealth and privilege and engendering the admiration of everyone from peasants to kings.
206;'Amadeus' may perpetuate the legends and myths that swirl about this musical icon, but Milos Forman's film adaptation celebrates the composer's genius so completely, anyone who sees this Oscar.
207;winning work will take away one emotion above all others.
208;Antonio Salieri's only dream is to create sublime music that will be revered by the masses both in his lifetime and well beyond, yet he's stymied by a limited talent and growing obsession with the """"giggly, dirty."""
209;"minded creature"" who consistently eclipses him."
210;That creature, of course, is Mozart, a self.
211;confessed vulgar man, who's also a living conduit for some of the most beautiful music the world has yet heard.
212;'Amadeus' is largely fictitious, but it cleverly takes seeds of truth and grows them into a compelling, substantive narrative.
213;drawn, complex creations, and Peter Shaffer (who won a Tony Award for his play and an Oscar for his adapted screenplay) instils in them a multitude of conflicting qualities.
214;And tragically, the pure, simple beauty of Mozart's notes and phrases .
215;music that elevates so many .
216;all the acting is terrific, especially Abraham as the tormented, conniving Antonio Salieri.
217;Hulce captures Mozart's randy playfulness and sly conceit, as well as his sober sense of purpose and enslavement to music.
218;edges personality nicely contrasts with the stuffy, fawning atmosphere of the emperor's court.
219;(This director's cut more completely develops her relationship with Salieri, and adds more depth to her character and performance.)
220;on its surface, 'Amadeus' may seem like a story of revenge and bitterness, but it's really about the transformative power of music, and how it can shape and twist fragile human psyches.
221;It's a stirring, impeccably produced work and deserving of all the accolades it received.
222;ray, especially when one considers its age.
223;Many scenes err on the soft side, but there's a healthy complement of sharp, well.
224;defined images that burst forth with excellent contrast and vibrant colour.
225;There's a lot of colour on display .
226;reds are especially lustrous and rich .
227;Though primaries shine, I was extremely impressed by the delicate pastel tones .
228;powder blues, sea greens, and lavenders .
229;all of which are exceptional.
230;Blacks possess appropriate depth (the tone really stands out in the gentlemen's jackets), shadow delineation is quite good, and fine details, such as wood grain and the weave of paper documents, can be striking.
231;Stable, true flesh tones predominate, and Abraham's heavy makeup as the elderly Salieri looks, for the most part, very natural, even in high.
232;some digital doctoring has been applied to spruce up the image, but it's subtle enough to keep critical characteristics intact.
233;The artistry of course is Mozart's glorious music.
234;From delicate strings to bombastic bursts of brass, from a soprano's trills to a robust basso aria, the track provides exceptionally pure, full.
235;Close your eyes and you'll swear you've been transported to a cavernous concert hall.
236;during dramatic scenes, the audio is anchored up front, but noticeable separation enlivens the action, while subtle ambient effects occasionally grace the rears.
237;Dialogue is very well prioritized, so we rarely miss a word of Shaffer's Oscar.
238;winning adaptation, and details such as the palace's squeaky wood floors and the ruffling of the layered period clothing are all vividly rendered.
239;The two men obviously like and admire each other and create a comfortable rapport, and their lively banter keeps the track moving.
240;"A Mozart scholar, Shaffer imparts a wealth of fascinating titbits about both composers that adds a great deal to the film

245;ray edition is a great place to start.
246;While its video transfer could have been more faithful to its source, it still offers a substantial upgrade over previous releases.
247;The performances, direction, and production values of this absorbing epic continue to impress a quarter century after its initial release.

249;Not all Best Picture winners deserve a spot on your shelf, but 'Amadeus' does, and this handsome Blu.

251;That is why I was so pleased to receive this wonderful package, as I have always wanted to see this film and now I have got round to seeing it at last and I was not disappointed and you will also get so much pleasure out of this stunning Blu.
252;`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.
253;I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.
254;Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.
255;`Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.
256;He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.
257;`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.
258;The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.
259;The two leads are brilliant.
260;Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.
261;i'm hopeful that some day Amazon's technical specifications listings will become more useful.
262;I love this version of the movie (the original theatrical release).
263;the thing i always loved about this movie was how tragic salieri was as a character.
264;this passion and drive are what made him so appealing!
265;the added scenes make him a villain, and thus, for me at least ruin his character.
266;it makes him a sympathetic character.
267;Since the middle 90s I have a beautiful laserdisc of the theatrical version of this movie and I'll keep it as long as the theatrical version won't be available again.
268;Most of the time, the director's cuts are wonderful but this time, it's awfull.
269;Can't say I'm much impressed with the special edition aspect of this .
270;but the film itself is amazing.
271;F. Murray Abraham proves that he is, in fact, one of the best.
272;His portrayal of Antonio Salieri is unprecedented in its believability and gives credence to the fact that Mr. Abraham is indeed one of the best actors of our generation.
273;Tom Hulce's performance is also impeccable: He actually *becomes* Mozart.
274;this ideal combination of acting talent makes for one of the best films ever produced .
275;its eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, are all well deserved.
276;Enough has been said about the wonderful cast led by Tom Hulce and Murray Abraham, and about writer Peter Shaffer's substitute of a moral fiction for the actual history of Mozart and Salieri.
277;taken but it's the fantastic way Milos Forman assembles a picture of 18th century Vienna and the life of its theater and concert halls, creating an environment of music.
278;making that is absolutely plausible and delightful to experience.
279;It's good, however, for those who don't know the difference.
280;Like Parker, Mozart thoroughly enjoyed life, pushing his enjoyment of both art and party to the extent that he probably drank himself to death, or otherwise poisoned himself with too much of everything.
281;The movie will introduce you to the miracle.
282;This is probably the best movie about the classical composer, even though it has historical improvisations .
283;Salieri in real life was helping Mozart a lot.
284;but!This is truly inspiring and very touching movie which perfectly depicts battles between the creator and the people in power, as well as the inner battle of the creative mind.
285;A great way to spend a cold winter's evening.
286;I have always loved this movie and look forward to watching it again and again.
287;Amadeus is a fantastic film that explores the life of famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
288;The film was a huge success when it was released in 1984.
289;I would argue this is one of the greatest films ever made.
290;the one star rating is for this, the Blu.
291;There will be those who enjoy seeing deleted scenes, myself included.
292;Amadeus was a great film when it was released 30 years ago.
293;The directors cut adds a lot of background and explanation to the story and makes the film even better
294;One of the best movies available on Prime without a doubt.
295;Outstanding acting and the music .
296;That is worth two stars.
297;Watching this show brought me peace and comfort.
298;I enjoyed the story and the music.
299;it is a long movie which made me feel I was getting something for the high price.
300;When you are used to paying 11.95 for an eleven page pamnphlet this feeling of getting a product at a good price is worth a star.
301;will you give it five stars?
302;Great movie, even though probably not entirely historically accurate.
303;It's very entertaining and was great fun to watch.
304;This is my favorite movie.
305;From the opening scene to the close, it is a well told masterpiece.
306;A visual and auditory delight with a myriad of wonderful characters.
307;It's a great film, but HEAVY.
308;This is more a movie about Salieri as he lives with a lifetime of jealousy.
309;F Murray Abraham does an incredible job.
310;Oscars for best film and best actor (among others) was well deserved
311;Amadeus has been my favorite movie since it was released.
312;top, this is a marvelously entertaining version of the play.
313;quiet meditation on the difference between talent and genius.
314;it's a colorful and enjoyable romp.
315;It also adds valuable scenes for instance when Constanza Mozart is turned down by Salieri.
316;F. Murray Abraham is stupendous in his role as Salieri and Tom Hulce is also great in his interpretation of Mozart.
317;I love the music, the costumes and the scenery of this amazing movie and I think it is a movie not to be missed.
318;I loved this when it first came out.
319;It's still amazing the music is just awesome.
320;And the acting very good as well.
321;He is really an incredible actor.
322;So basically much off it is fiction but you're still enjoy it.
323;And of course his musical genius is impressive.
324;What this fascinating and extremely interesting movie vividly conveyed to me was something of the life of 18th century Vienna, as well as the beginnings of an understanding of the divinity in classical music.
325;The sound was uplifting, in a way I never really experienced previously.
326;The script was intelligent, the acting excellent.
327;I thought Elizabeth Berridge was extremely endearing in her role as Mozart's wife, even though it may well not have matched the historical reality.
328;Murray Abraham's face spoke volumes, and I thought his performance was superlative in the part, as written.
329;This is a truth which Americans, especially and self.
330;It's also a partial truth that those whom the gods love die young.
331;This film is a mind.
332;The best classical music film ever
333;F Murray Abraham was Academy Award winner for good reason.
334;It is everything I remember about it.
335;Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie.
336;Of course, the other can work well as well .
337;e. g. """"Elvira Madigan"""", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became """"the Elvira Madigan theme""""."""
338;the direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable.
339;crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.
340;It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary.
341;He had a sense of humor and fun.
342;Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public.
343;It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.
344;Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple.
345;while I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 4 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth.
346;so here goes ==> 'Amadeus' undoubtedly the greatest, most insightful, and by far the most Entertaining biographical film on any Classical Composer (at least in the English Language, I think there have been a number of German/Austrian productions .
347;genius (perfectly captured by Tom Hulce), for which composing and performing was second.
348;nature (perhaps even First nature!)
349;"Now of course this film, and original play takes great Liberties with its most intriguing subject matter ==> but all to good effect
350;acted and authentically staged film = Oldman and Rossellini gave intensely charismatic performances .
351;but the liveliness, vitality, and Resilient/Indomitable 'Spirit' seemed lacking somewhat (the Music conducted by Solti was Great though).
352;I really wish they make a Great Beethoven Film one.
353;day ==> that could actually win the Best Picture Oscar, like 'Amadeus'!!
354;The Director's version added about thirty minutes and a fair amount of information.
355;It's a beautiful film that deals with brilliance, mediocrity, jealousy, obsession, and tragedy.
356;great great movie and the music is just awesome specially in 5.1 surround.
357;It is one of Milos Forman's greatest works and can never be duplicated.
358;The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is fascinating, incredibly re.
359;made by the creative team of AMADEUS.
360;The real story behind the movie is the playwright himself, Peter Shaffer, who adapted his Tony Award Winning play into an incredible film.
361;It shows how brilliant he is.
362;The story centers around Antonio Salieri(a once successful composer and now a suicidal old man, who tells his story from within a mental hospital, a favorite spot for Milos Forman's films.
363;This film won the 1985 Oscar for Best Picture, along with seven other Oscars including Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume, and most importantly, Best Actor.
364;As Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is astounding.
365;Tom Hulce, I feel, gives a performance of a lifetime as Mozart, and rightfully deserves much praise for his fiery and passionate Mozart.
366;He is a brilliant actor.
367;The supporting cast is excellent, headed by the always wonderful Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor, Christine Ebersole(Recently won 2001 Tony Award for Best Actress in 42nd Street), Barbara Byrne(Original Cast Member of Into the Woods), Roy Dotrice(Played opposite Zero Mostel in A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum), and Simon Callow.
368;It is a magnificent film and a must.
369;We connect so with all the cast you feel their pain and joy throughout this amazing drama.
370;He also feels emotions of love for a woman but never expresses it.
371;Not only is he brilliant, but he's unafraid to do anything.
372;Wolfie is in love with life, and he embraces it in it's fullest.
373;In addition, he is delighted, amused, but to a certain degree also tortured by the beauty he creates.
374;Truly, Mozart is a man we can see ourselves in easily.
375;In the beginning she starts out much like Wolfgang, happy and carefree.
376;several other characters strike a chord with us.
377;Overall, this is an amazing film filled with every human emotion.
378;It can and does create a greater understanding and appreciation of the incredible Wolfgang Amadeus.
379;I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves Mozart or at the very least are interested in Mozart.
380;I loved this film so much!
381;The story is intense as the movie.
382;Clever and funny I shared it with my wife now she's in love.
383;Having the movie as a """"flipper"""" is impractical."""
384;this film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short.
385;Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream .
386;to be a great composer.
387;He chalks this up to God's will for his career.
388;profane, forward, and a great composer.
389;the director's cut adds some additional scenes that flesh out the motivations for the characters, and you would think that this adds to the film, but actually it detracts from it.
390;I rather liked imagining what went on between the characters and having some of the sexual situations and conflicts insinuated and largely left up to the imagination of the viewer.
391;the cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding.
392;The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects.
393;I highly recommend the film, and if you never saw the theatrical cut I doubt you will be bothered by the added material of the director's cut.
394;People always gripe about Hollywood executives who smoosh directors' visions, but if this movie is any indication, they sometimes see things much more clearly than the directors.
395;Amadeus has always been one of my favorite movies, but I've never had a copy.
396;Absolutely one of the all time best movies.
397;I remember crying at the end when I first saw this movie as a child and it's just as moving today (I cried again).
398;The incredible music, the strict attention to period details, even the story perspective (Mozart's life through the eyes of a rival he didn't even know he had) was genius.
399;Even if you don't like classical music, this movie is worth watching.
400;I love this movie, it was great when it first came out and still great.
401;The Director's Cut did fill in a bit and made the movie that much more.
402;Can watch with the whole family and definitely fosters interest in classic music.
403;The directors cut was very good, it added a few details from what I remember after seeing it many times before.
404;This is an interesting movie about Mozart, based on an urban legend.
405;The Director's Cut version added in a few things that did clarify some things in the original that didn't make as much sense to me.
406;Between the well done costumes and sets to the selections of his music used throughout the movie, this is definitely worth a watch for those interested in Mozart, music or a bit of history.
407;Having always liked the movie Amadeus.
408;There is about 20 minutes of additional footage that explains a bit more of the movie.
409;I think that is totally cool.
410;But still, a cool goodie.
411;the movie's good too, with a crisp, clear picture.
412;Costumes and sets are lush and evocative, the acting is divine, and the direction is incredible.
413;This movie won a lot of awards back in its day, and for good reason.
414;an ambitious, envious and tortured soul who is a prominent but less celebrated composer in Mozarts' time.
415;"When I finally looked up the title to this film, I found ""Amadeus"" is Latin for ""loved by God,"" and it is a perfect summation to Salieri's inner conflict."
416;This story isn't meant to be historically accurate, but the premise is interesting and the performances, like the music, are perfect.
417;Despite the films' serious undertones, it has a lot of humor.
418;I saw the original cut in a Warner Bros. screening room before its public release in the early 80s (worked for them at the time) and enjoyed it a lot.
419;I don't know it well enough to recognize all of the material added in the this Director's Cut, but the entire film seem to flow far better than the original.
420;As I write, I taking a short break, about half way through the film and I've enjoyed ever minute so far.
421;The acting is superb, the settings and photography are world.
422;"Mr. Abraham's performance is underrated, simply because he is the bad guy
423;The young fellow playing Mozart (I'm spacing his name at the moment) is outstanding and, I strongly suspect has some serious musical talent in his own right.
424;After watching multiple replays of many keyboard sequences, I have to believe that he played most of them himself.
425;As leisurely home entertainment, this Director's Cut is well worth the time for a complete viewing.
426;My Thanks to Amazon for making it available via Prime"
427;In time, I'll probably watch this one again.
428;This film serves them well and yes, a flip.
429;This is entertainment and probably one of the top ten films that I've ever seen.
430;Don Giovanni ran more than five performances, and was not a flop .
431;The film explores the consequences of Salieri's actions .
432;this is an ambitious idea that could have easily descended into a simple revenge plot, but all involved keep their eyes on the higher drama.
433;F. Murray Abraham, given the role of his life, captures Salieri's agony beautifully.
434;He's jealous of, and repulsed by, Mozart the man, but is completely in love with the music, and you can see both feelings written on his face as he attends Mozart's operas.
435;forman's directing is excellent, and he deserved his best director Oscar.
436;"In ""Amadeus,"" where Mozart is a supporting character, his gradual alienation from the world serves the main plot beautifully."
437;"It also works in ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,"" despite Forman's efforts to glorify the title character, because Flynt becomes the catalyst for a thoughtful meditation on free speech."
438;But when Forman celebrates eccentrics for the sake of being eccentric .
439;"Mozart's music gives the film beauty
440;Tom Hulce is quirky and amazing in the title role, with a fine cast backing his performance.
441;The Direstor's Cut of this movie is definitely a cut above the original, which also was excellent.
442;Mozart is my favorite composer!
443;The story line is quite fictional, but interesting.
444;I see now that the original also had a kind of vagueness that enhanced the mysteriousness of the story and made it more dramatic and believable.
445;As most people know, filmmaking is a collaborative effort, and while directors are usually considered the overriding force in the creation of a film, often the contributions of editors, producers and """"evil"""" studio execs do have a positive impact on the final product."""
446;"(Directors are especially ""godlike"" in the U. s. There's an old saying about whose role is most important: in France it's the playwright, in England it's the actor, in America it's the director.)"
447;Like authors, directors need really good editors!
448;"Amadeus was perfect as it was
449;I've seen this movie many times, yet each time I view it I am amazed at the artistry, the music, the acting, the costumes the settings.
450;everything about this movie and the story is well written, well acted and completely engaging.
451;Such is a story that means as much today as ever.
452;This film is one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.
453;The acting of Tom Hulce as Mozart is truly wonderful, he puts such dimension and passion into his performance that one can't help but hear the music of Mozart without thinking of him.
454;F. Murray Abraham's performance as Antonio Salieri is pure genius.
455;I found this unsual and inconvenient.
456;It's one of the most amazing, entertaining, enthralling biopics ever made.
457;director Milos Forman and screenwriter Peter Shaffer offer insightful commentary.
458;There's a wonderful documentary on the making of the film which contains great soundbites from the cast and crew, interesting trivia tidbits and great behind.
459;the film itself is a joy.
460;watching is fine but you have to love the music to sit though it.
461;I highly recommend getting the soundtrack.
462;This is a very intesting movie.
463;I watched it about 20 years ago and wanted to watch it again.
464;It was very well made and the actors are exceptional.
465;It looks at how art gets produced, the place of art in society, the pain and suffering that can come with genius, and all of that with a wonderful story that has love, sex, deceit, betrayal.
466;Its well known to Mozart scholars that he was under.
467;Salieri, as depicted in this film does his best to gently move the spotlight away from Wolfgang BUT he also is shown to admire and revere Mozarts talent and music.
468;In any case, this story, and indeed the new Directors Cut of this film is a masterpiece.
469;If there are flaws, it does not show, nor would it overshadow the majesty and profound beauty of this film.
470;this version looks clean, crisp and vibrant in color.
471;The sound is wonderful and the new cut clarifies Constanza's determination to promote her husbands music and the lengths she was willing to go for it with Salieri, a point that was not as clear in the shorter version.
472;As others have said, F. Murray Abraham's performance is amazing, mesmerizing, determined and flawless.
473;he is also an actor who was brilliant in this difficult and demanding role as the fun.
474;loving, drunken, loveable, spoiled but brilliant genius Mozart was.
475;The more so as the movie depicted how Mozart, deprived of wealth and success, was initially reluctant to take a mystery man's proposal .
476;He simply could not face his own demons and revisit his guilt towards his father, plus he lacked the energy to finish such a grand project.
477;the script was ingeniously written and tightly knit.
478;The music score powerful and touching.
479;The movie presented sympathetic and unbiased views of Salieri and Mozart at the same time.
480;Coupled with fine performances of the two actors, the movie allowed the audience to see and judge for themselves.
481;Abraham's brilliant portrayal of Salieri won him the Oscar .
482;The movie also reminds me of the biblical parable of Lazarus and the wealthy man.
483;This is such a great movie.
484;It makes you really appreciate the genius of Mozart's music while being just a great entertaining movie.
485;The picture was very good for a movie that old, and the 5.1 soundtrack made the opera sequences a little easier to take.
486;The performances, especially by F. Murray Abraham as the mediocrity, makes this a great film though.
487;Instead, the lavish adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play is a thrilling meditation on genius and jealousy, madness and mediocrity, anchored by an excellent cast and some of the world's greatest music.
488;F. Murray Abraham won a Best Actor Oscar (at long last, Salieri triumphs!)
489;It's a smart, exhilarating movie and well worth watching (or rewatching).
490;Nominated for 11 academy awards, including the two lead actors.
491;Excellent music by a musical genius.
492;Kept me riveted the entire movie, and the actors kept you emotionally involved with them.
493;Great Opera scenes even for the non opera person.
494;The movie Amadeus by Milos Forman is truly a masterpiece.
495;It has spectacular set design and costumes, Mozart's compositions throughout and interesing dialogue.
496;It is one of the best movies I have seen in my life and highly recommend it.
497;Neat and compact, the set takes little space but gives much enjoyment.
498;I've seen Amadeus many times so I was able to spot the added scenes, there were many, you will not be disappointed if you are watching this your second or third time.
499;Nice surprise for me, was not expecting so many additional scenes.
500;When it came time to replace my VHS cassette tape version, I bought this one.
501;Now that I own it, I think it's clear that I made the right move.
502;I have loved this movie for as long as i can remember!
503;Will keep this movie forever!
504;Classic film with a fun take on Mozart's life, trials, tribulations, and successes.
505;Awesome movie, beware it is 3 hours long but great acting and story are there all the way and any musician or music fan would enjoy.
506;I truly love how this movie looks in Blu.
507;Amadeus is a favorite movie and it is so beautiful to look at.
508;This movie has almost 20 minutes added in and it really enhances the movie.
509;The music is the star.
510;We really enjoyed the additional disk which included the players revisiting their experiences while making the movie.
511;Great movie, with wonderful scores of music.
512;If you like classical music you will enjoy this film, and if you do not like classical music you will be greatly suprised.
513;He adores Mozart because of his amazing musical gifts, and loathes him because somehow he fails to measure up to his own idealized visions of what great genius should be.
514;when I first saw this film in 1984, I was incredibly moved by Mozart's story and his astounding music, and by the breathtaking scope of the film.
515;Over the years, I have come to see it from the more chilling viewpoint of watching a mad celebrity stalker destroying something unspeakably beautiful because he himself cannot have it.
516;There are chilling messages in this film, but in spite of the terrible tragedy of it all, Mozart still wins and literally gets the last laugh.
517;She is smart, strong, and loyal, and comes perilously close to discovering Salieri's true nature.
518;I loved her for her courage, and that comes close to the nature of the real Constanze, whatever may have been written about her to the contrary.
519;but the heart of this film is the unforgettable music of Mozart, and that is what matters.
520;It is absolutely amazing and a true classic, even though there are some inconsistencies with Mozart's life events.
521;Perfect dosage of music, humor and drama.
522;After watching it, I looked up the history of Salieri and found the whole relationship with Mozart very interesting.
523;All I can say is that after all these years, I am still deeply touched by the story, its characters and the absolute perfectionism and emotion with which the film was realized.
524;even though this one is wonderfully crafted.
525;It shows the immense dedication and emotionality that everyone in the project contributed: Shaffer, Forman, all actors and production staff.
526;I am thankful for this wonderful work.
527;This movie won a lot of awards when it came out in 1984 and it's easy to see why.
528;Beautifully shot in Prague, Czechoslovakia, a city absolutely perfect for re.
529;This film really shines a light on its actors.
530;He is perfect as the cocky, brilliant, yet troubled composer.
531;F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for his performance as Salieri, the successful, yet mediocre antagonist.
532;the film really is beautiful on Blu Ray.
533;If you go into the film knowing only Mozart's name, but nothing else, you'll end it with a deep appreciation for the man's' gift.
534;The wonderful composition is even better on Blu Ray than imagined.
535;It's not only one of my favorite Blu Rays"
536;Although it probably distorts the relationship between Mozart and Solieri, this is certainly worthy of all the awards, including 8 Academies, it has received.
537;It is a movie in the grand tradition of hollywood epics of the past.
538;I say this because this movie's music (Mozart's)is splended and is a good way for the young ones to become acquainted with that composer life and music.
539;Of course I know a lot of the movie contains quite a bit of fabrication for dramatic reasons but the music and some of its history of composition/performance is true to historical fact.
540;"disc ""directors cut"" and I am happy with both and can at least tailor a ""movie night"" to the appropriate audience."
541;But fantastic in the costuming department.
542;I do discuss the changes in the Director's Cut version, and I also discuss the themes of the movie, which spoils the movie for those who have never seen it.
543;Amazon is now offering Milos Forman's Director's Cut of Amadeus free on Prime.
544;If, like me, you haven't seen the movie in a number of years, it's very much worth watching again.
545;It all came out perfect.
546;The production design and costuming are stunningly accurate, transporting you to Mozart's time and place.
547;The opera performances are sumptuous and exciting .
548;Almost never have image and sound synthesized so perfectly .
549;Speaking of Abraham, his performance anchors the picture.
550;He has gotten plenty of work since 1984, but he's so completely Salieri here that he will be Salieri forever, and I truly hope he doesn't mind that!
551;Finally, the movie is rich with supporting actors like Jeffrey Well, there it is!
552;I do wish it had more palatable opinions about human endeavor, but Amadeus has become part of our cultural consciousness, and it's entertaining to boot.
553;Compulsory for anyone interested in good music.
554;This film is a great, great appetizer to introduce the classical music novice to how incredibly rich and structured classical music is.
555;As an added bonus, I bought the soundtrack, and a Best of Mozart set, what a fantastic salve to rush.
556;The plot was as rich and developed as the music.
557;Hulce delivers an impressive performance as well, masterfully illustrating the character Mozart's dichotomy of other.
558;"I stress ""tried"" because the film also makes it clear what a genius Mozart was ."
559;F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as Salieri .
560;Even Salieri admired and cherished Mozart's works.
561;The movie contains a great selection of his works, used both as background music and in the foreground with scenes involving his operas performed on stage.
562;my favorite part of the movie was Mozart himself.
563;Tom Hulce was dynamic in the role, conveying Mozart's zest for life, an abundance of passion for his work, and his deterioration toward the end.
564;On the spur of the moment, Mozart was able to memorize and improve upon a small piece by Salieri which he heard only once.
565;He fought against any minor changes to his own work because he considered it perfect as it was written.
566;Mozart was rightfully proud of his work, but as a result of his pride and non.
567;While the end is tragic, the movie still left me delighted by the wonderful music and how full of life they made Mozart seem.
568;The result is a showcase of cinematic talent set to the score of some of Mozart's finest music.
569;the scene where a dying Mozart dictates his Requiem to Albinoni is zany and impossible, yet still an adrenaline.
570;pumping piece of dramatic fiction and one of the film's proudest moments.
571;all eight of this film's Oscars were well earned.
572;I should just take this film's version of the story as creative licence, based on incomplete and uncertain information much as Hamlet is on the historical story of Amled.
573;One of the most memorable vignettes in the film comes at a point where these two are at each other's throats and Mozart himself walks slowly out of the room looking as if he has seen a ghost .
574;the divine inspiration is suddenly on him.
575;I was brought up on a great deal of sentimental gush about the supposely unspeakable tragedy of a great composer buried in a communal grave .
576;All the characters are magnificent!
577;F. murray Abraham's facial reactions are a treat in themselves!
578;The movie is great, although I understand it is not necessarily historically accurate.
579;The movie gives a view of late 18th century Austria that is beautiful to behold.
580;The blu ray picture is beautiful and the costumes and scenery really pop.
581;the music is beautiful as well.
582;I have to admit that when this movie come out in theatres I was in college, but it sparked an interest I still have for more sophisticated music.
583;While that movie won Best Picture there was a Directors Cut released that is rated R for a brief instance of topless female nudity.
584;I think this version of the movie is actually better than the original as it expands a bit on the motivations of the primary characters.
585;I bought this originally on Laser Disc because I loved the movie and it's music.
586;I saw the Director's Cut version in the theaters years ago and it's well worth the ticket price.
587;I give it four stars because the acting is good, great story, 2nd disc Making of., and I love W. a. Mozart.
588;Get the Director's Cut is all I say!
589;The great film, Amadeus, does not even try.
590;the movie is great because the characters are so fresh and fun.
591;Mozart is a real hoot with his laugh and Salieri's intense hatred of him is obvious.
592;This film shows us a reasonable guess at what his last 10 years were probably like.
593;The music is great, the acting superb, and the film was definitely deserving of its Best Film award.
594;I find it interesting that Abraham and Hulce, after such a great performance in such a highly publicized movie, really have slipped into oblivion.
595;I enjoyed the movie very much.
596;please release a special edition!!
597;This film is truly one of the all time greats.
598;for anyone who loves music, this is a beautiful film.
599;there is something poetic in the screenplay.
600;the acting is absolutely superb.
601;there is a perfect flow in this film.
602;all film students should study this film and learn how to make a true masterpiece.
603;It was one of those rare instances where the director had seemed to capture magic on film.
604;"Something definitely went right with ""Amadeus"": the perfect blend of the best people in every department, from the best music ever composed, to the superb acting from all players, the great script, costuming, right down to craft service, I would imagine."
605;Also, having seen the original cut so many times, I found the restored footage to be very jarring, and thought it interrupted the pacing.
606;The clarity of the picture and the incredible soundtrack just blew me away.
607;Constanze's character is allowed to develop in these added scenes, making her more sympathetic and more real.
608;Several bits of dialogue tacked on to existing scenes could have been left out since they add little to the film aside from length, but adding the new footage does absolutely nothing to diminish the magic of this truly great film.
609;"It's got a couple really nice extras, too: a ""making of"" featurette, and a commentary track (which, if I'm not mistaken, is actually portions of the laser disc commentary with some new bits added."
610;At times hilarious, at others poignant, and always filled with the music of Mozart, this movie is fun and entertaining from start to finish, and looks, sounds, and feels brand new.
611;I give it my highest recommendation!
612;This is just groundbreaking genius work.
613;This is a must see!
614;time favorite films since High School.
615;But he was absolutely brilliant in the part.
616;In Jeffery Jones' first scenes as the Emperor Joseph, he resembled a one.
617;Elizabeth Berridge's Constanze is strong and supportive as Mozart's wife.
618;Sex and the City era Cynthia Nixon is a wide.
619;Ultimately, we see his life as a glorious, musical romp through a Rococo.
620;the name means beloved of God, and happily, the film bearing this name was the beloved of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
621;I love this movie for its under.
622;"Salieri's conviction that God is his enemy, and God's representation on Earth is a Trickter par excellence
623;For some reason, I believe that Mozart himself would love this role and story.
624;The soundtrack to this film is sublime is its most awesome, frightening and beautiful meaning.
625;Superb and interesting plot presentation.
626;Amadeus is one of my favorite composers"
627;Amadeus is one of the greatest movies ever made and it is one of my favorites.
628;winner) tells about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, Oscar.
629;Amadeus is the winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (Milos Forman).
630;If you don't know anything about Mozart this is the most entertaining way to learn about the incredible child prodigy that the world is forever Indebited to.
631;"I'd really like to see the movie ""Amadeus""."
632;I'm sure someone decided this was a better version, but I really prefer the original.
633;The movie was very interesting, and quite entertaining.
634;"Many times so. called ""director's cuts"" do add something worthwhile (Blade Runner comes to mind)."
635;The original released on Blu.
636;This movie is great on many levels but my most favorite reason for loving it is because it is quite witty!
637;I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, enjoyed it, and had forgotten about it.
638;I like to watch it with my eyes closed so I can pay attention to the music.
639;It is so well done and of course the music is masterful.
640;This is one of my favorite movies of all times.
641;Tom Hulce is absolutely amazing in it.
642;This is one of the best movies i have seen for a long time.
643;In fact it is the movie that got me into classical music.
644;The scene with Saglieri explaining one of Amadeus piece is one of the best ever.
645;This movie is an incredible piece of work which can be watched again and again without being bored.
646;There is great detail and a superb performance of the actors and actresses.
647;"Amadeus was released in 1984
648;Even though they portray Mozart as a buffoon, who is also a musical genius, the sensational music is timeless.
649;The sets and costumes are extraordinary, as are the acting performances.
650;F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as Antonio Salieri"
651;Amadeus is a first rate film that will still be magnificant 50 years from now.
652;The Music helped to make this production a real pleasure.
653;Amadeus featured amazing performances by the actors, great costumes and wonderful writing, not to mention beautifully integrated music supporting and enlarging the action of the film.
654;but the director was clearly in love with the complexities he went through in recreating Mozart's operatic performances.
655;Much tighter, more concentrated, and a proper balance of music and story line.
656;I still was entranced with the music, and most of the acting.
657;AMADEUS, a great work of cinematic art, brought to the screen by the great Milos Foreman, is perhaps (in my opinion) one of the greatest films of his career.
658;known and beautifully written Mozart compositions.
659;I will say that the acting is great, the music is gorgeous, there are moments of great humor, followed by high drama and the whole plot concept of this film is not so much crafted to romanticize Mozart as a man and an artist (far from it).
660;This is a very distinctive, evocative and compelling work of art.
661;It's an Oscar winning masterpiece about one of the greatest composers in history.
662;Written and acted brilliantly and beautiful to the eye.
663;My teenager even loved it!
664;The music however, is of course great and comes across strongly.
665;I love the history of Mozart and this movie so enjoyably depicts his alleged flamboyant life and personality.
666;The script is fun, the camera work is excellent, and the music obviously is fantastic which sounds great in 5.1.
667;What a fun and exciting movie depicting the life of Mozart.
668;Every minute of this film is fun and I can't say enough good things about it.
669;I would highly recommend this movie whether you are a fan of classical music or not.
670;It's a really entertaining family movie and if I ever have kids someday this is going to be one of the first movies they get to watch!I see some people ripping on the directors cut of this film.
671;Otherwise, this movie is still excellent stuff and a great family movie.
672;With Amadeus, we're presented with a compelling, albeit inaccurate, portrayal of the maestro's life, and the results are beautiful!The strength in any good movie always starts with the acting, and Amadeus is well.
673;F. Murray Abraham delivers a great performance as Mozart's envious colleague, Antonio Salieri, while Tom Hulce hands us a memorable enactment of the title character.
674;Added to the mix are fine efforts by the supporting cast, rounding out the presentation.
675;"imagery is crucial in films of this sort, and we are not disappointed in this area
676;The opera scenes are magnificent, making the viewer feel as though they were present.
677;Nonetheless, my above rating should read: 4 1/2 stars.
678;Surrender to it, you'll be glad you did!
679;This movie deserved the Oscars it won.
680;What a great portrayal of genius mixing with insanity.
681;This is a must see, even if you don't like classical music.
682;The use of Mozart's music in telling the tale is remarkable, and Milo's Forman's direction is powerful.
683;F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce were certainly well cast, and look for a young Cynthia Nixon in a plot twist.
684;I'm glad I saw it again with fresh eyes!
685;The characters are developed and the audience comes to care for them and fear their enevidable hardships and downfalls.
686;One finds themself angered along with Salieri with God, giddy and consumed with Mozart, and entranced with Stanzi, his childlike, yet shrewd bride.
687;The ornate dresses and hair of the women, the styled suits of the men.
688;While I am not a great fan of opera I was pulled into the beauty of the ones in the movie, the way the the music was described and the perfect choreography.
689;One of the greatest lines was in that scene"
690;And as an added bonus it was funny as well.
691;Everybody, go out and getit today!
692;I'm a fan of Mozart and this move (although not entirely historically accurate) is a must see!
693;I encourage all music/comedy lovers to watch!
694;There were extra scenes that just felt over.
695;I give that one 5 stars!
696;This brings back some great movie making moments, While an older film, this holds up well over time.
697;wonderful music and clear picture.
698;telling coupled with lavish production, threaded throughout with Mozart masterpieces makes Amadeus a multi.
699;But marvelous to see and hear.
700;my roommate and i both enjoyed this film on the life of WolfgangAmadeus Mozart.
701;the acting is first rate.
702;jeffrey Jones has a great turnas well,as Emperor Joseph II.
703;all told,this a remarkable achievement.
704;The extras more than deliver on their promise.
705;not only did I get the joy of watching once again one of the best movies to have ever been released .
706;but the extras (behind the scenes, the commentaries) added to my delight.
707;i truly find it hard to put into words how wonderful this movie is.
708;It is more than just a grand journey through the worlds of these two men (yes, granted, told from a movie point.
709;The entire package, from the scenery, the costumes, the story and THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC, THE MUSIC!!!
710;ray Edition it makes the movie even greater.
711;It is a historical drama done right.
712;"Amadeus is historically accurate, as far as it goes, even down to Mozart's annoying laugh, which was described by a contemporary as ""metal scraping glass""."
713;and since God has refused to give him the ultimate talent to sing his praises, and instead gave it to that vulgar iconoclast kid, he will do everything in his power, use all his wiles, to defeat and kill him.
714;Salieri suffers : he is good enough to know that Mozart is an absolute genius, but cannot be elevated to his level.
715;for sure, the sets are sumptuous, and the acting right on the note.
716;But there is no point in overaccentuating those : this is a masterpiece, deserving of all the praises it got.
717;famous film of Milos Forman in very nice adjustment.
718;Nice graphic and very good text.
719;Record is technically perfect, both picture and sound.
720;Gives insight in the life of Mozart and his time.
721;He truly was a genius!
722;One of my favorite movies
723;clearity was very good, item was shipped very fast, would not be afraid to us this provider of movie again.
724;This is truly a great movie.
725;Loved the movie when it came and loved it again when I saw it.
726;Audio is fantastic with suround as the music really makes this a true classic!
727;A must have movie for any music lover!
728;As expected, the music was quite amazing.
729;I bought this to watch with my kids.
730;One of my all time favorites.
731;When I first saw this movie in the 80 I loved somethings about it, I'd say most of it, especially the way Mozart's music comes to life.
732;A very committed political activist, a rebel against authoritarianism, a free.
733;well, this time, my partner Julie said to me to watch the movie as seen from Salieri's mind.
734;This helped, Salieri in this story sees Wolfi as a clown, but also sees his musical genius.
735;"(and of course, the mainstream US culture also seems to have difficulty appreciating the positive value of sensuality and sexuality
736;i recommend three books to get a broader perspective:Maynard Salomon's biography """"Mozart""""Mozart A Life ebookMricke's """"Mozart on His Journey to Prag"""" [.]"""
737;"and finally the book that Shaffer based his play on by Alexander Pushkin ""Mozart and Salieri""Submitted with love and respect."
738;"I loved ""Amadeus"" from my childhood."
739;I think it is the greatest movie of all time.
740;However blackmailing scene is really wonderful, watch the great acting from both Constantsa and Salieri.
741;"this edition includes very interesting material of making the ""Amadeus"", Director, actors everybody's invloved in it."
742;So at the end I recommend this movie to everybody in the world.
743;People, this movie is as good as it gets.
744;The best movie of all time!
745;I was a very good movies that gave the insight of his passion for music and the destructive envy of another.
746;I would recommend this movie to really see his life come alive.
747;Its a good insight to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts life and the people who surrounded him
748;This is a must watch.
749;This movie has everything, it has superb acting, art, storyline, and everything else .
750;Amadeus is a true classic movie.
751;The musical score is amazing and the acting performances are truly under rated.
752;You can see why it won some Oscars.
753;"I saw this in theaters years ago
754;i remember watching it in europe years ago when it came out and loved it again after so many years.
755;The acting of Murray and Hulce, as Salieri and Mozart respectively, was quite exceptional in this film.
756;and it was exceptional as well . . . so maybe I'm just a sucker for a well.
757;done production about one of my favorite composers.
758;I think they really did do a superb job in making the scenes look like it's 18th/19th Century style, and how Mozart's life was even more exciting that you could see the movie!I really enjoyed it!
759;I loved this refreshing portrayal of Mozart and Abraham's unforgettable characterization of Salieri.
760;His discovery and realization of Mozart's genius is so vivid and convincing, that anyone watching comes away with a new or renewed appreciation for this great music.
761;The human side of these people makes this story special also.
762;Mozart's immortal achievements are destined to live on and we come to share Salieri's wonder and respect for this music.
763;Although historically inaccurate on many counts, the spirit of the music and its impact on the times is true to the heart.
764;Worthy of the praise this movie has received, I highly recommend it.
765;I enjoy both versions of the film.
766;and fine detail has been lost or smeared.
767;this really breaks my heart, as this is one of my favorite films.
768;And hey, he may seem a mediocre composer when compared to Mozart, but he's actually written some excellent operas and certainly deserves much more credit than he gets now.
769;The original cut won all the Oscars for a reason.
770;award winning film based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756.1791), my favorite composer of all time, is very well done, in terms of costume and set design (as well as the make.
771;up job on F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar Best Actor, beating out his fellow actor Tom Hulce, who portrayed the man who was """"Beloved Of God."""")"""
772;"The brief bits of opera which were shown were staged very well by the legendary Twyla Tharp (especially ""Don Giovanni"")."
773;For that and the utter beauty and timelessness music of the Master itself, I give it three stars.
774;given gift to write sublime music.
775;Constanze loved Mozart with all her heart and would NEVER have done such an atrocious thing.
776;excellent period piece, but I DO NOT recommend it as a history lesson.
777;does deter from the fact its a brilliant production.
778;a well done flowing visual, dramatic film
779;"The regular cut of Amadeus is very hard to improve upon
780;I have viewed both the Regular and the Director's Cut recently.
781;Disc B of the Director's Cut offers interesting facts about the making of the movie, although I found it shocking to see what 17 years of post.
782;The most interesting part was F. Murray Abraham's description of the make.
783;The music is some of the greatest ever composed and the acting is superb.
784;it more than earned every Oscar it received.
785;Humor, irreverence, joy of living, grace, charm and lack of pomp and circumstance.
786;Mozart and Salieri, the arouse of a genius in the Court, the fertile and creative inspiration of Salzburg 's son is sculpted and showed with such freshness and naturalness that you may well think this could be the happy result of a successful transcription of an Operatic script into the screen.
787;the next January 27th 2006 the whole world will be celebrating the 250th anniversary of this notable composer.
788;And in this sense the renowned Concert Halls all over the world, from the Royal Festival Hall to Carnegie Hall to the most discrete theaters will show us the music of this genius , a true artistic patrimony of the mankind.
789;so it results more than desirable to begin with this memorable homage ito Mozart 's memory and his invaluable musical legacy, that should be listened far beyond this extraordinary date.
790;The sound is clearer so the miraculous music is heard PERFECTLY.
791;The picture is more rich and colorful so you can enjoy every detail of the opulence in Vienna, the elegant costume and opera sceneries.
792;We laugh along with Mozart's famous laugh.
793;Despite the darkness in Amadeus, there is humor.
794;Frau Webber is comedic as Mozart's mother in law.
795;The mock opera in the common theatre, the Vaudeville is very humorous as well.
796;There are little things that make Amadeus a great film, not excluding the greater things.
797;There is a beauty to the music, the showiness of the Emperor's palace, the opera houses with those blazing chandaliers.
798;there is a greatness to the film of the fall of the world's greatest composer and the music !
799;The Requiem focused in the end is a masterpiece.
800;The scenes of Mozart's death is awe.
801;See it for yourself and enjoy a classic.
802;As many have said the story of Mozart's life may not have been portrayed completely accurate, but the story they do portray is an excellent one.
803;The movie Amadeus is literally the best one I've ever watched in my life!
804;The way it's set out makes it feel like its the 1700's!
805;I love the music played in there and it's just really great!!
806;Beautiful period piece about Mozart.
807;Acting is superb, especially F. Murray Abraham.
808;finally a few days ago I decided to give it a chance, well I must say that I have been missing a masterpiece for quite a long time.
809;Tom Dulce makes a perfect interpretation of Mozart, hi laugh is just so original and so unique.
810;i really liked this movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should, I know it lasts 3 hours but they are worthy.
811;Interesting, but prefer original best.
812;My favorite movie and Composer.
813;im sorry to say but the original cut is perfect.
814;this movie is a gem either case, ive seen it over and over.
815;I've always loved this movie since I first saw it as a kid.
816;The music is amazing, the story is compelling.
817;It is amazing the difference between the two movies and soundtracks, The extended movie and soundtrack go well together.
818;I have always considered the theatrical release one of the best movies ever.
819;I love music, and this story.
820;Together it definitely made me happy to order this set.
821;Certainly a fantasia on the life of one of the world's greatest composers, Amadeus is more much more than merely dreamed biography.
822;It soars above the retelling of a wonderous life, presenting to us a mosiac of deep meaning, wonderful performances, sensational music, and one of the best movies ever made.
823;Whereas the power in their lives rests in the monarchy, they are the true power of this film as they dance and weave around each other.
824;By giving us some creative if not accurate context for Mozart's music, we see the true brilliance of his greatness, by comparing and listening to his music through Salieri's simple ears.
825;The finest moment of the film perhaps comes at the ending, with Salieri, an old and feeble man, realizing that his life has added up to nothing but mediocrity and meagerness.
826;Their acting is so perfect, so refined, it is not acting, it is being.
827;On the screen, the real Salieri and Mozart are before you.
828;This duality drives the tension and the drama, making the film so wonderfully complex and deep.
829;it is well worth your time, if you have not yet done it, to settle down and allow Amadeus to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.
830;Although this movie may not be implicitly follow documented history and, at some junctures, may create it from whole cloth, it is completely captivating.
831;The characters are fully developed and you empathize with the situations and state of mind in which all the characters find themselves.
832;It is one of the classic fiction movies about Mozart.
833;It's wonderful interpretation of his life, music and career.
834;I think it is one of a kind and every music lover would enjoy seeing it.
835;Great movie, a bit on the dark side, but very interesting.
836;Watched it 20 years ago, and enjoyed it more this time.
837;this was a relative accurate depiction of Mozart i found it a really good movie because of this.
838;This is the best this film has ever looked on home video,It's very nice as it includes all of the content of the 2.
839;Very recommended for fans of the Oscar winning film!
840;This one is dyanmic and high definition.
841;I enjoy the sound too.
842;After all those years, it's still a very good movie, but I still have the same feeling I got when I first saw it back when.
843;There are so much production going on, and while it's pretty spectacular, a whole lot of it doesn't really contribute to the storytelling.
844;And it makes it even more odd when characters all speak English while the movie makes all efforts to make it visually authentic.
845;I just gotta say that this film was simply brilliant just like Mozart himself!
846;As for that guy who's against Mozart, well, I felt mad and yet sympathized him.
847;This film is really, really good!
848;A good look back at history.
849;An absolutely captivating, interesting and entertaining movie.
850;You don't have to be a classical music fan to enjoy this one!
851;I watched this film in a humanities class and enjoyed it thoroughly.
852;The acting is superb"
853;Indeed, everyone in the movie, from the main characters to the NDs, is very convincing.
854;Visual factors, such as set design and lighting, are flawless.
855;The score, as one might expect, is collected from Mozart's great works.
856;Although classical music in modern movies sometimes backfires, it is executed perfectly here, and the effect is very nice.
857;Very entertaining almost completely fictional depiction of Mozart's life and death.
858;Casting and acting is awesome.
859;Amadeus is a grand honor to the composer Mozart.
860;The movie is beautifully crammed with the composer's most famous music.
861;The story of his life is compelling, funny and wonderful.
862;I watched it as soon as I got it!
863;It is a magnificent movie showing the life of a truly incomparable musician, Mozart!!
864;Always a fan of the original film but this version adds more depth ,tells more back story and shows a more nuanced feel and crystallizes the theme god vs man
865;Looking for older movies on Blu I was excited to hear about this film.
866;I knew it had the potential to be an excellent example of why Blu.
867;ray matters and I'm very happy Warner Bros gave this package treatment worthy of 5 stars.
868;given the right equipment, a Blu.
869;ray viewing of Amadeus is incredible.
870;ray, a home theater viewing will be like the first time seeing this film for many.
871;ray book package contains the Directors Cut of the film along with many bonus features on the first disc.
872;Seen movie several times in the past and enjoyed it.
873;After seeing the original version at least ten times, something I never do, I found the director's cut version very interesting.
874;This is such a good movie and I've watched it so many times I thought I knew every line so it was surprising to see things I had not seen before.
875;Amadeus is a very good film.
876;So if you are interested in the extras, be aware.
877;This Director's Cut version has all of the scenes and music I have memorized, plus some additional footage.
878;Highly recommended for any flavor of music lover.
879;this is one of the best movies ever made.
880;As one of the users said, the music is real anyway.
881;one of the discs contain the movie (it has both the director's cut and the theatrical versions) and the other one is the special features (interviews etc).
882;well, I want to tell you about the Blu.
883;ray.Yes it's worth to pay for the Blu.
884;I have a 7.1 sound system with Pioneer Elite receiver, and some nice, really decent speakers.
885;First of all, the music in this flick is just simply amazing.
886;The story, plot, and acting are top notch as well.
887;I've seen this at least 10 times, and undoubtedly will see it a few more!
888;Movie making at its best.
889;abraham won a well deserved Oscar, yet it's Hulce who steals the show with his credible,offbeat portrayal of Mozart.
890;Having watched the original cut a dozen times over, the extra footages in this director's cut are somewhat refreshing.
891;There are a few cuts that should have been left out, but in all, this is still Amadeus and you will enjoy it if you liked the original movie.
892;One of my all time favorite movies.
893;The movie is a classic, and is a very interesting piece of historical fiction.
894;Good acting, amazing music, and sounded really nice on the surround sound.
895;Please?I was first exposed to this movie when I was in highschool and have loved it from that point on.
896;Amadeus introduced me to the world of classical music, something I'd never been exposed to up until that point.
897;I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who's wanting to introduce someone to classical music.
898;This director's cut version sheds quite a new light on the tension between Constanze and Salieri.
899;Amazing that they cut his entire scenes right out.
900;Tom Hulce did an awesome job and the actor who played Wolfgang's Father looks so much like the real Leopold, it was actually frightening!
901;:) The film really shows not only the genuis of the greatest composer who ever lived, but also shows the type of man he was in his childish, vulgar and humorous ways.
902;BRAVO to the director, Milos Forman and all the actors and actresses who did a grand job showing the world Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music and his life.
903;full of wonderful music, great costumes, highbrow and lowbrow settings.
904;One of the top 10 musicals in my collection.
905;"A marvelously acted, flawlessly directed story about jealousy, obsession, and perfectionism, Forman's stunning ""Amadeus"" mixes suspenseful drama with historical fact to create a winning fictional biography."
906;The lead actors inhabit their roles with gusto, with Hulce's crass talent playing off Abraham's guileful Salieri with great results.
907;Neville Marriner brings Mozart's music to vigorous life.
908;"Winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Abraham), ""Amadeus"" is a triumph that will delight anyone with a soft spot for cracked genius."
909;This is a beautifully photographed and recorded film, and the performances are top notch.
910;The film otherwise is would be great for preteens.
911;This is an example of an excellent film by excellent actors and all the while describing a 100% true account of the worlds finest composer ever.
912;I loved the music, the time in history,as it depicted the human struggles of young talent developing.
913;"The film is great
914;If you still prefer the theatrical release of this movie (meaning no extra storyline) then this is the one for you.
915;I actually have both versions and prefer this one.
916;It is a great portrait of Mozart, and has incredible performances by Abraham and Hulce.
917;If you like this movie, it is worth owning.
918;ray as a separate item or as an alternative viewing option on the Director's Cut.
919;There is also a brief scene of female nudity that seems a bit gratuitous.
920;Normally I'm not one to complain about a little female flesh being exposed, but I think the film works well enough without it.
921;there is one small addition that I did enjoy, though.
922;That brilliant composition simply HAD to be an accident!
923;Salieri's lines are briefly extended in that moment, and it adds a wonderful touch of menace.
924;the LaserDisc release included a wonderful behind.
925;Despite the fact that the story is only partially true, it is the best retelling of the genius' life story.
926;Contains some of the most beautiful music written to date.
927;A real joy to watch.
928;A great comedy for the whole family.
929;There's one nude scene, but the rest is pretty PG.
930;Highly recommended for anyone with 3 hours to kill.
931;This is a masterpeice nonetheless.
932;I love Mozart and bought the VHS version of 'Amadeus' shortly after it became available.
933;The visuals effect is clearer than the VHS version and seems fresh and vibrant.
934;this is absolutely the best movie about any musician or composer ever done.
935;The music is without doubt the best assemblage of Mozart's best.
936;The Adagio is my favorite piece of music and must have been given to Mozart to write by God.
937;This scene brings tears to my eyes every time I watch.
938;His words are remarkably how most commentators view this music.
939;Amadeus (1984) The epic (and at times, darkly comedic) story of classical music genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
940;Abraham bested co. star Tom Hulce for the Oscar as Alberto Salieri, Mozart's greatest rival and (in an ironic twist of fate) his fiercest admirer.
941;If you have ever read anything about Mozart you still need to see this grand epic of triumph and tragedy, joy and sorrow, loyalty and betrayal.
942;In """"Amadeus"""" he shatters all preconceptions of his talents as an actor, deserving credit for fully realizing a complex, satisfying character with pure sincerity and wham."""
943;the music is exquisite, needless to say, and Milos Forman once again proves his mettle as a fierce director .
944;"like after you witness the depth and beauty of ""Amadeus."""
945;Turn it up and let Hulce steal you away!
946;This is the perfect film for anyone who doesn't REALLY enjoy classical music, because here, the music is transforming and you become caught up in its lyrical melodies as much as in the story.
947;A wonderful film with a magnificent performance by Tom Hulce!
948;The movie is very moving, touching and inspiring.
949;I've loved classical music for years and being a young music listener, this has all the best Mozart.
950;Tom Hulce is wonderful portraying Mozart.
951;I must say Jeffrey Jones, who played Emperor Joseph, sounds like one of those very important businessmen.
952;You'll feel a lot better watching the VHS.
953;Amadeus looks and sounds great on videotape.
954;The movie swept the Academy Award ceremony the year of its release, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, and five others and it holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#53).
955;This is odd for a movie about classical music that features a lot of opera singing in it.
956;For me, the most appealing thing about the film is the two lead performances.
957;Throughout the film, Salieri is a sympathetic character despite the fact that he's a jealous, only quasi.
958;talented man jealous of someone else's gifts.
959;The movie is, obviously, a period piece and it does have lavish costumes and people writing with feathers.
960;"I know a good many people who won't watch a movie for those reasons, but ""Amadeus"" feels extraordinarily modern."
961;Forman, a Czechoslovakian director who made films there and then came to America to great success, is a great director and this film is one of his greatest triumphs.
962;It's funny, has great dialogue, and the performances are (once again) DYNAMITE!
963;This movie is a great glimpse of Europe at its best.
964;The time is one of the most interesting in history.
965;I was OK with this web.
966;based movie since I got to view it right away, and I can view it again, just can't view it on my TV set
967;with Neville Mariner's wonderful renditions of Mozart's music .
968;it is also on of the best LOOKING movies ever filmed.
969;you need letterbox to be able to take in the breathtaking compositions.
970;The film looks and sounds great.
971;"This is merely another instance of the studio jacking up the price by offering a ""two disc special edition."
972;This is a LONG movie.
973;tHE FILM ITSELF: Peter Schaffer is one of the best, most underrated playwrights of our time.
974;Equus is one of the great masterpieces of modern theater.
975;In the documentary, he pontificates about how thousands of actors were tested, and how important casting is.
976;The exception to this, of course, is F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this performance.
977;He is an accomplished theater actor who knows how to use his voice.
978;Even though he does not affect an English accent, he knows how to do elevated dialogue so we believe his Salieri.
979;The best parts of the movie are of the old Salieri reciting Peter Schaffer's wonderful dialogue over the music of Mozart.
980;Now I have seen this movie many times, and I love every minute of it.
981;This is an outstanding movie.
982;Amadeus was an excellent Movie, very well done, music excellent and customs incredible !!
983;"Story is not factual
984;Had to watch this movie for a music appreciation college class.
985;The movie has a great story line, (lots of liberty taken by writers and director here .
986;not an actual true historical rendering of Mozart's end of life), and the music is just awesome!The work of Mozart runs throughout the story and is interjected into scenes just beautifully.
987;I actuallyhad a few tears in a couple of places.
988;I would definitely recommend this movie.
989;I love the movie Amadeus.
990;The music is soothing and entertaining.
991;I enjoy watching the storyline of the movie and can relate to what is happening.
992;It is a moving and touching movie.
993;I gave it 5 stars cause it is worth it.
994;Amadeus is one of my favorite films, and one that I watch annually at least.
995;Since then, I have devoured this masterpiece of cinematography time and time again.
996;The scenes, while interesting if you are an Amadeus buff, are definitely extraneous and were originally cut out with good reason.
997;Some of these people were easily able, it seemed, to win a job with a major orchestra like the New York Philharmonic.
998;I can completely sympathize with Salieri's jealousy, particularly towards Mozart the Child, who received nothing but the best of the best of the best training, mostly from his highly musical father.
999;Many musical prodigies I have known in my own life are so perfect precisely because of error.
1000;Think of the great friendship and wonderful musical projects the two of you could have collaborated on!
1001;As one who enjoys historical fiction in books, I enjoy it even more in movies.
1002;While books and movies are more subjective, I like to believe that they are closer to the reality of the history than just a set of names, places, dates.
1003;I saw this in a theater when it first came out, and I've seen it numerous times since then.
1004;of course I love all of Mozart's works.
1005;i mean, the way it is woven into the story.
1006;F. Murray Abraham (Salieri) and Tom Hulce (Mozart) are truly amazing.
1007;I love love this movie!
1008;I was mesmorized by the beauty of the music and amazed at Salieri's hatred for Mozart.
1009;That scene is probably one of the most memorable for me because while he's burning it I could feel his pain.
1010;i have watched this movie at least 40 times and have memorized entire scenes and say them along with the movie.
1011;This is by far my favorite movie ever.
1012;Amadeus is a haunting dramatic true telling of two lives that were both changed forever by fate.
1013;Tom Hulce is surprisingly good in the role as 'Wolfie'.
1014;He is an incredible actor and I recommend this movie to everyone.
1015;It's amazing, plain and simple.
1016;This is a great movie.
1017;I would recommend it to anyone.
1018;Many wonderful scenes that were cut in the original are in this one.
1019;Helps with the storyline and includes some more fabulous acting by the actors.
1020;If you're a fan of the original Amadeus, this one is a must see.
1021;I highly recommend adding it to your collection.
1022;Great acting and great music.
1023;I love the story line of love, admiration, betrayal and absolution on the part of salieri.
1024;the restored print is fabulous"
1025;the uncompressed audio is also quite beautiful.
1026;Others have really liked the additions, which brings me to my point.
1027;The commentary is new, and there is the occasional interesting tidbit to be found.
1028;"the packaging with the included booklet is very elegant
1029;bottom line, I think most of you will want this because you want this classic film to look great and sound great, and as such you will not be disappointed.
1030;Had this on order in advance, and am really enjoying it.
1031;Inspecting each young musician, he looks for some outward sign of genius: the """"man who had written his first concerto at the age of four, his first symphony at seven, and a full."""
1032;But Milos Forman's stunning epic did not win eight Academy Awards for simply reducing classical music royalty to child.
1033;in all its filth and splendor, driven by the virtuosity of Mozart's compositions.
1034;amadeus is one of those magical and rare films with a nearly perfect mixture of beautiful writing, glorious music, elegant cinematography, remarkable acting, dazzling art direction, and an engrossing story.
1035;It ranges from grand to ribald, from hilarious to heartbreaking, from chilling to endearing.
1036;And it is by far one of my favorite films of all time.
1037;defined the first time around or giving us a couple of new laughs.
1038;On the other hand, the reissue's greatest drawback is its attention.
1039;Just make sure you go to the bathroom right before the trailers.
1040;i bought this for my brother, who loves this movie.
1041;I have watched this movie many times and enjoy it very much.
1042;I know it is not historically completely accurate but it is a powerhouse movie just the same.
1043;I had not viewed this in several years still a great movie, F Murray Abraham is a great actor.
1044;Great movie, if you love Mozart, then you love his story.
1045;Well directed and the acting was great.
1046;Something for the whole family to enjoy.
1047;I teach a music appreciation course for junior high and this far exceeds any educational film I could show.
1048;Not only is it an excellent storyline but the music, the showing of serious and comic opera and of the life and politics of the times, emphasizes everything I teach.
1049;It brings it all into focus for the students.
1050;i have loved this film since I first saw it in the theaters!
1051;I have been watching it for at least thirty five years and will continue to do so for years to come!
1052;This is a great movie for those who love to revel in period piece movies and music.
1053;The psychological logic of Amadeus kept me glued to this movie.
1054;This was an amazing movie, and I can not remember one point in the movie where I wanted it to be over.
1055;He acts so much like he is actually the real musical genius, it's amazing.
1056;He portrays Mozart much like I actually pictured the man: very energetic.
1057;The way he conducts sometimes shows how energetic Mozart actually was in life.
1058;This gets him into a lot of trouble with the woman who thought Mozart loved her.
1059;The emporer finally suggests that the two marry, and eventually, they do.
1060;award winning performance of F. Murray Abraham as Saliere was astounding and spooky beyond all reason.
1061;He is amazingly realistic when he starts saying that God is his worst enemy.
1062;He is extraordinary as the tone.
1063;A nice touch it is when he recalls the incident with young Mozart, about 7, proposes to his sister Antoinette.
1064;He talks about Antoinette at intervals throughout the movie, and his performance is quite enjoyable.
1065;But it was still one of the greatest movies in movie history.
1066;i would recommend this for ages 11 and up.
1067;this is a full recommendation!
1068;well, I've said a mouthful.
1069;The story, although fictionalized, is an intriguing one.
1070;Salieri, the pious man who prayed to God to be given sublime musical talent, has to face the fact that God has given it to Mozart, who is exuberant, childish, and bawdy.
1071;The character of Mozart, on the other hand, is fun, even though the real Mozart wasn't really that over.
1072;I might add, however, that the distinguishing giggle is actually historically accurate.
1073;Overall, though, a worthy addition to any movie collection.
1074;"But this set gets even better than just technical improvements
1075;the 2nd disc includes a 20th Anniversary documentary on the making of Amadeus.
1076;I found this documentary fascinating!The additional scenes added by Forman to make this a Director's Cut do not add to the movie, in my opinion.
1077;Amadeus was a perfect gem to start, the additional sequences slow things down.
1078;Even if you think you don't like classical music, you will find within yourself a new appreciation for the construction theory of music, way a composer's mind translates inspiration into beauty.
1079;Fabulous music and great story!
1080;This is a surprise in itself.
1081;It is a very great film, exceptionally worthy of its Oscars, and the role of a lifetime for Tom Hulse.
1082;The operatic and musical scenes in this film succeed on a scale never seen before.
1083;The finale of Don Giovanni is better in this movie than in the two live performances I've seen and the performance Herbert von Karajan led that was shown on PBS in 1990.
1084;The direction, acting, script and locations are all sumptuous.
1085;life Mozart by the portrayal of Hulse in this film.
1086;He also played by the rules of the day and adored Salieri, respecting his role as the musical director in Vienna.
1087;Still, it's fair to set history aside in a work of art this fine.
1088;Anyone that likes great music or great movies will enjoy this.
1089;I love this movie, and this longer version has lots of hidden nuggets that the original left out, highly recommended.
1090;Critics and historians differ on the truth behind the story and hollywood admits to taking license in their portrayal.
1091;One of the greatest movies to ever grace this small blue marble.
1092;While the story takes great liberty, the acting, music and intrigue are phenomenal.
1093;end scene with Mozart and Salieri captures the entire film.
1094;Absolute genius, just as it should be.
1095;It is amazing to see the completed film.
1096;I highly recommend this class movie to anyone who likes music and good acting.
1097;The acting is great, as is the music.
1098;This is simply a film that belongs in any music.
1099;sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script.
1100;received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) .
1101;portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle.
1102;lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys.
1103;the composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions.
1104;But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar.
1105;are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen.
1106;beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by an unexpected tragedy.
1107;Incredibly, the MPAA has given the film an R rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera.
1108;Spanish subtitles, I really love this movie!
1109;I watch this movie over and over.
1110;It never ceases to amaze me with the superb acting and story.
1111;Mozart's life was truely a great story.
1112;It was interesting and entertaining.
1113;There are a few long drawn out scenes that are a bit boring, but overall it was great.
1114;The historical elements were especially interesting.
1115;There are AFI top 100 movies that I watch once because I feel I should.
1116;There are movies I watch several times because they're involving.
1117;And then there are movies I own because they are immensely powerful.
1118;Amadeus is definitely one that I own, and one that I highly encourage others to watch several times if not own.
1119;There are numerous of Mozart's works on display here, not only with the gorgeous music, but put into a context.
1120;You can see why Mozart created these works and how they were received.
1121;You see the sets, see the environments they were put on within.
1122;He's the antagonist, Salieri, whose only desire in life is to create beautiful music for God.
1123;To him it's simple child's play to make the march more interesting.
1124;The way he has fun playing upside down and backwards.
1125;Salieri's obsession is a talented opera singer.
1126;She keeps him afloat, takes action to save the family at several points, and yet the ONLY time in the entire movie that a woman talks with another woman is when Mozart's wife briefly asks her new maid (Cynthia Dixon of Sex in the City fame) to please step outside.
1127;I could play this in the background and just absorb the gorgeous music being presented.
1128;Highly recommended as a movie to connect a wealth of people with music the might not have been drawn to otherwise.
1129;Took great pains to accurately design the sets.
1130;Excellent movie and fantastic interpretation of Amadeus Mozart's life.
1131;The character is alive and real .
1132;although the dialogue is in today's English, it makes it more compelling.
1133;There is some poetic license in the movie, but the story is a good biography set in the early 1800's.
1134;that only God could have given him this amazing talent.
1135;we see and hear Mozart's masterful works performed, as well as his new and innovative ways of presenting opera and symphonies.
1136;mozart attends a party with his father and wife .
1137;and ends up mocking Saleri's music in good fun.
1138;He has immortality in his music.
1139;, and the epic recreation of 18th.
1140;As you fall in love with Mozart and his childlike persona juxtaposed with his musical genius and maturity at such a young age, you can't help but fall in love with the acting genius of F. Murray Abraham.
1141;His character portrayal of Antonio Salieri is, in my humble opinion, the most extraordinary, enigmatic performance ever captured on film.
1142;His gestures, his facial expressions, his passion, his overwhelming presence brings Salieri to life and then some.
1143;If you're a fan of glorious music, this film will move you.
1144;If you're a fan of Mozart, this film will enrapture you.
1145;If you're a fan of great acting, this film should be your Bible.
1146;Abraham won the Best Actor Oscar for this role, and he will forever be revered in the annals of film by this extraordinary performance.
1147;Tom Hulce also did a marvelous job portraying Mozart.
1148;What a treat for the senses.
1149;I love my new movie!
1150;So happy to find this movie brand.
1151;This is the most beautiful movie for anyone who loves music and history.
1152;I think its a great movie.
1153;But when I realized how much extra footage was there, I got curious.
1154;Thus it takes on a character unlike the original.
1155;There is an American actor who plays a patron, for example, who hires Mozart to teach his young daughter music"
1156;but the scene in which I always thought Salieri's final reaction to Frau Mozart's ploy to get him to help them.
1157;makes a lot more sense here.
1158;a movie that really does Mozart justice?This movie is really a Johnny One Note.
1159;How incredible to have such a masterpiece in my own video library.
1160;The performances, the acting and the music are wonderful.
1161;Released in 1984, Amadeus is still immensely entertaining with F. Murray Abraham as a Machiavellian Salieri and Tom Hulce as the musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
1162;This movie won several academy awards including best picture and best actor (F. Murray Abraham).
1163;Tom Hulce was also nominated for best actor for his performance as Mozart.
1164;Brings the classical age to life and sheds a new light on the greatest composer and his contemporaries.
1165;Amazing music, acting, costumes, sets and cast.
1166;It deserved all of the awards it received.
1167;You can omit the trailers, the commentary and all the extras.
1168;Lush production that stands the test of time.
1169;The music comes alive in a way that is rare in any film.
1170;This Directors cut has surprising and significant footage that never made it into the original release, making revisiting this gorgeous classic a real treat.
1171;This movie is an all around work of art.
1172;one of the best movies ever made, made better.
1173;Such a great movie a complete historical fantasyThis is a one of a kind movie the three hours just fly by
1174;I saw Amadeus first in a movie theater and loved it.
1175;Seeing it again in my home was so entertaining.
1176;The music, the story, the acting were all fine.
1177;I had never seen this movie before and loved the music as well as the story.
1178;With todays cinematography, it could be even greater.
1179;As a music educator I enjoy showing this each year to my high school music class.
1180;Although it the Hollywood adaptation takes some freedoms with the actual facts, it's a good way for kids to get introduced to Mozart.
1181;while I can't really compare it with the theatrical version (which I haven't seen in over ten years), the director's cut is opulent, fascinating .
1182;The acting by Tom Hulce and especially F Murray Abraham is quite wonderful, as is the music, and the sets are astounding, but it's just .
1183;There's also a commentary with Forman and Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play the movie was based on, and explain their choices in changing certain aspects of the play (last year I played Mozart in a production of AMADEUS, and I was shocked at how much the film differs from the play, not only content.
1184;wise but also, in a lesser way, thematically).
1185;I love the movie .
1186;'Amadeus' won 8 oscars in 1984 when the movie came out and till this day it hasn't aged a bit.
1187;The new director's cut adds a few scenes that clarify some parts of the story.
1188;salieri is a man fighting with God.
1189;saliere is insulted by Mozart all the time in love but also in music.
1190;Mozart replays it and starts to freshen it up, mocking the old piece.
1191;The title of the movie alsorefers to that since it means 'beloved of god'.
1192;f Murray Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, and most of all as the old Salieri talking to a priest to tell of his plans and his life fighting Mozart.
1193;outstanding also are the costumes and of course the brilliant music of one of the greatst composers of all time.
1194;Even if you don't like classical music however this movie will entertain you highly as a psychological drama.
1195;I found this movie to be beautiful and riveting.
1196;I love the beauty and detail of the eighteenth century atmosphere, particularly because it's my favorite era in history.
1197;Take it for what it is, which is a beautifully photographed and composed film offering a great feast for your senses.
1198;this film also brought about a new interest in Mozart and classical music for me, which is also why this film gets five stars.
1199;The compositions and planning for the film were spectacular.
1200;One of my all time favorite movies!!!
1201;I was so happy when I remembered that I didn't own it and was able to find it on here right away
1202;The original release of Amadeaus was great, the Director's Cut version is even better.
1203;I recommend to have the Director's Cut version, even though one might have the original release.
1204;The sound and the picture have been greatly enhanced.
1205;I personally rate 'Amadeaus' to be one the greatest movies produced so far.
1206;Needed this movie for a class and it was great!
1207;I love the added scenes in this version.
1208;If you are a fan of music, or just a great story, then I highly recommend this one.
1209;Besides being a visual and musical masterpiece of film making, it kick.
1210;long love of and appreciation for classical music.
1211;if you loved the original, you owe it to yourself to pick up this version.
1212;If you're new to classical music and Mozart, this is the best place to start.
1213;Although this film takes great factual liberties, it succeeds in bringing to life the spirit and genuis of a stunningly brilliant human being.
1214;The almost magical intrigue that surrounds Mozarts life and death is captured with the theatrical and dramatic impact that would be expected from such an extraordinary life.
1215;This is one of those rare films that can be viewed more than just a few times.
1216;Mozarts music soars througout the film with the brilliant direction of Sir Neville Marriner.
1217;When this movie version of what had been a huge Broadway hit was announced, critics and Broadway fans alike were excited.
1218;But Hulce turned out to be an excellent choice as the alternately depressed and manic Mozart, Abraham was of course brilliant, and the then.
1219;unknown Elizabeth Berridge, who was brought in to replace an injured Meg Tilly after the film was already in production, did a great job in bringing the role of Constanze to life.
1220;The costumes, the sets, the direction, Neville Mariner's score and the script were all similarly brilliant.
1221;I hope that the story line did keep to Wolfee's life.
1222;The filming in Europe was very impressive.
1223;i think I did good getting this movie
1224;I'll start off by stating that this is my favorite movie.
1225;Has been my whole life since I was a little kid.
1226;I for one love the directors cut.
1227;I for one enjoy those added elements, but I'm also someone who likes directors cuts.
1228;I can honestly see and understand though why some prefer the theatrical cut.
1229;I Still think it adds something though.
1230;it's a wonderful yarn about Mozart's' time in Vienna.
1231;There is very little historical fact in it so just take it as a wonderful ride of intrigue.
1232;It's also a sensational introduction to Mozart's amazing music.
1233;It truly is my favorite and I recommend it to everyone I know.
1234;Do yourself a favor and check it out.
1235;Pure, and utter perfection in movie making.
1236;one is the story of the life of Mozart.
1237;f. Murray Abraham is in reality the main focus of the movie and he was totally amazing.
1238;one of the greatest movies of all time.
1239;Milos Forman is an incredibly talented director who's superlative (if untrue in many spots) and lavish film about Mozart's short life still has me on the edge of my seat today.
1240;The director's cut included a few scenes of intrigue.
1241;I enjoyed watching this, however so many liberties were taken about Mozart's life, that I found parts of it not believable.
1242;I liked that the music was the third character and I enjoyed the conflict and the setting, but I think Mozart would not have been as taken in by his enemies as suggested in the film.
1243;I like poetic license up to a point.
1244;One of the best blends of humor, beautiful music, drama and romance that I have ever seen.
1245;Guessing that the director's cut added some time.
1246;He plays another, and suddenly the priest's eyes light up in instant recognition and shouts: oh yes I know this one, is this yours?Salieri with a very bitter sigh responds: this is Mozart!What a way to start a film and what a scene to introduce that masterpiece that is Amadeus.
1247;this is the story of THE best musical biography ever filmed(Period!)
1248;It is a very ambitious film, very lush, beautiful to watch and hear, an epic of dramatic and musical propotions.
1249;there are good music biographies,like Ken Russell's Music Lovers (Russell has a life long passion for classical music), his own unique version of Tchaikovsky's life, in addition to Lizstmania and Mahler.
1250;this status comes from the fact that the director and writer successfully manage to give an equal treatment to the music,the genuis of Mozart, and to the human drama, the essence of Mozart.
1251;It's been more than two decades since I have seen this Best Picture Oscar winner and in that time I had forgotten what a wonderful movie it is.
1252;It is surprising now to see Tom Hulce as Mozart get second billing (after F. Murray Abraham), as his is the showier role and that Abraham won the Oscar for Best Actor over him.
1253;the film looks absolutely stunning on Blu.
1254;The picture is sharp, the sound exceptional (as is befitting for a film dealing with music).
1255;The film also has a commentary track and an interesting documentary on the making of the movie (in standard definition).
1256;For those already familiar with this fine multi.
1257;winning film, this director's cut makes for a darker, more cynical viewing experience.
1258;"the original theater release seemed to have a ""nicer"" balance of humor and dark drama and could be said to be appropriate entertainment for mature children."
1259;the music is still marvelous.
1260;The performances are all first.
1261;The scenes are brilliantly staged and shot.
1262;Worth the price for the extended version.
1263;Good movie, would recommend it.
1264;Amadeus is easily one of the best movies ever made that won Best Picture for 1984.
1265;It's a story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played wonderfully by Tom Hulce (Oscar.
1266;F. Murray Abraham won the Oscar for playing Antonio Salieri, a competent composer, and Milos Forman won the Oscar for Best Director.
1267;interesting to see Salieri, in neat costumes and ingratiating in obvious feline way, set himself to captivate the emperor's attention and please `his friendly enemy' Mozart.
1268;beethoven was a great admirer of Mozart and later used him as a model (Piano concerto No 4 .
1269;There is that special list of movies to be enjoyed and appreciated again and again.
1270;A movie that works on every level.
1271;The additional scenes added in this cut are interesting, and fill out some plot holes in the original film.
1272;One of my favorite movies of all time .
1273;it's like seeing it for the first time all over again.
1274;A hearty thank you to all responsible and involved in bringing this gem to blu.
1275;the music is exquisite and the story compelling.
1276;The film has subtle nuances that leap out at you with the penetrating performances of Tom Hulce as Mozart and his character foil F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri.
1277;The film score is broad and gives us a cross.
1278;achieved composer admiring and hating the genius of the happy.
1279;The convention is really ingenious with F. Murray Abraham giving a convincing performance as an older cankerous Salieri.
1280;The film shows a devout appreciation of Mozart's music and gives it life weaving its creation with the turns of the rocky course of Mozart's carefree, but ultimately tragic life.
1281;The appreciation of the music comes across as not being false, pretentious, or heavy.
1282;handed a pratfall that many other great artists .
1283;Hulce's performance as Mozart is a spectacle to behold.
1284;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll toot on your Magic Flute.
1285;One of my 5 favorite movies of all time.
1286;It captivates and moves the heart.
1287;Absolutely one of the most beautiful films ever made.
1288;A must see for anyone interesting in classical music or plain great acting!
1289;Watching a genuis like Mozart work was a beautiful thing to watch.
1290;I won't give anything away but it is a great movie.
1291;A true pleasure and a joy to experience this masterpiece.
1292;THAT'S RIGHT, can you believe it.
1293;"This is painful for me on two counts: in general I am a big fan of director's cuts, and ""Amadeus"" is one of my favorite films of all time."
1294;Now I'll be selling it and returning to the vigor, pace, scripting and complex but perfectly woven plot lines of the theatrical release.
1295;The Director cut really didn't add anything to movie I was just as happy with original.
1296;This is the greatest movie I have seen, the closest to perfection a film has ever come.
1297;done all the way around, and it includes perhaps the best soundtrack a movie has ever had.
1298;I highly recommend finding three hours to watch this movie.
1299;This is one of the greatest films ever made.
1300;Well directed, well acted, great music (obviously), and a story with characters that will wrench your heart.
1301;But the story that is presented is wonderfully evocative and enrapturing.
1302;Any fan of film would love it.
1303;this edition is the way to go, as well.
1304;The commentary is insightful and worthwhile, and all the other special features are well worth the time.
1305;The director's cut still seems a bit foreign, because I have nearly the whole movie memorised, each scene, musical piece and dialogue, and I'm just not used to the new bits.
1306;but, even so, the director's cut is downright brilliant!
1307;Whether the original release or the special edition , this movie is ingenious and masterful.
1308;Usually, huge historic deviances annoy the heck out of me, but in this case, they're all acceptable, and no one minds them a bit, thanks to a FABULOUS screenplay, tremendous acting and brilliant directing.
1309;everyone is perfectly cast, whether originally designed for the role or no.
1310;All the actors in this movie were perfect, so thank Fate for how it ended up!We are able to immediately feel appropriate emotions for all the characters involved .
1311;Rosenberg, love for Mozart, admiration for the shrewd Constranze, and love for the somewhat simple.
1312;fabulous music performances by the incomparable Neville Martin.
1313;Great commentary by Milos Forman and Peter Shaffer.
1314;And a great making of that gives you all the odds and ends and trials of making this magnificent film.
1315;Heralded as, As perfect as any movie can get.
1316;I thought I'd give it a shot.
1317;it's absolutely true the things you hear about this film.
1318;It truly is some of the best filmaking in the history of movies.
1319;As many other reviewers have pointed out, the absolutely most brilliant scene in the movie takes place near the end as a dying Mozart is composing Requiem with Salieri documenting the notes.
1320;One of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in a film.
1321;I am a huge fan of Amadeus.
1322;It breathes intense emotion to the heart through supreme acting, an amazing drama, great costumes and music .
1323;please note that my review contains spoilers.
1324;besides that, the rest of the film remains one of my favourite classics of all time, and the reason I started listening to classical music.
1325;The plot is amazing, you are enchanted by it and can't get out until the end of the movie.
1326;The actors, especially the one that acts Mozart, are great, and add to the great plot.
1327;The incredible music of Mozart is wisefully combined in the movie, and is a part of the plot and not just background.
1328;Together, they create a powerfull, Beautiful and terrifying, thrilling and hilarious, movie, that will leave its impression on the watcher.
1329;i also think that it's a good movie to watch with the young musician, say 14, especially those that play Mozart anyway.
1330;I'm reading his biography, and now I listen to his music with more understanding to the man behind it.
1331;Fun to watch again, good story without any dull moments.
1332;But on its own terms, as entertainment, it has much to offer.
1333;First, the acting by Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham is wonderful.
1334;Also, it is a good introduction to the work of this composer, if you are unfamiliar with it.
1335;it makes for entertaining cinema.
1336;Everything about this movie is five star, music, costumes, director, and F. Murray Abraham's role as Saleri who won an Oscar.
1337;01.22.14 Actor Tom Hulce was someone I never saw before this movie but I enjoyed his portrayal of the great composer Wolfgang Amaderus Mozart very much.
1338;He was a young man, of phenomenal talent and vivid imagination and boundless energy.
1339;A brilliant comet the streaked across the musical sky of Europe, transforming music forever.
1340;to labor on his last great work, the Requiem, awarded to him as an anonymous commission, by a mystery messenger.
1341;The roles of the Emperor, the Theater Director and others were wonderfully portrayed by a cluster of British actors including the versatile Roy Dotrice.
1342;sir Neville Marriner leads the musical forces of ______________________ in a wonderful and timely score.
1343;Cranking out volumes of works, perfect as a fine gem.
1344;Salieri is overwhelmed, emotionally and intellectually, as the papers slip from his hands and fall to the floor.
1345;Indeed!As a real man, Mozart was an energetic bustling genius and music simply poured out of him like water.
1346;He was, besides Beethoven and Haydn the greatest composer of all.
1347;If, however, you keep this in mindduring the viewing of Amadeu, you will find it a terrific movie.
1348;Too bad, a wonderful opportunity squandered for the sake of the box.
1349;happy viewing and god Bless you, all, Tony.
1350;The film shines in all areas: cinematography, direction, acting, and costumes.
1351;Although the rumors have little weight in history, they form a great foundation for a drama such as this film.
1352;Tom Hulce plays the childish Mozart to perfection with his spurts of laughter and giggles.
1353;Abraham received an Oscar for his role as the brooding Salieri.
1354;Supporting this great film is the beautiful music of Mozart performed by The Academy of Saint Martin.
1355;fields: Sir Neville Marinner conducting: one of the finest symphonic groups for Mozart's music.
1356;The drama and humor in the film are, like the music, suited for all ages.
1357;A great film for the entire family.
1358;One of my favorite movies of all time.
1359;Wonderful performances, this was one of the first albums I ever bought that was classical music and launched me on my journey of discovery.
1360;what we get here is a beautifully scripted essay on Envy, God and your Just Deserts (and why you don't always get them), played out between light and dark in the beautiful setting of Prague.
1361;As befits a theatrical adaptation, the symbolism is stark .
1362;For the most part, you can judge the sympathies of a given character at a point in time by the colour of his or her wig.
1363;good tip (especially for those stuffy types who don't dig Tom Hulce's hyena impersonation): watch the film with the alternative music only soundtrack.
1364;Salieri's obsession with these contradictions precedes a developing madness.
1365;The whole is film is based on this great premise.
1366;That is all it is about!
1367;The costume design is highly regarded as some of the best committed to celluloid, including the hairdos.
1368;He is so good in this role that once you see the movie.
1369;This movie will take you back to the beginning of classical music and help you understand just how important it was and IS to our culture today!
1370;My wife and I love this movie.
1371;after watching it again, the wife said she wold love to have a copy to watch when we want.
1372;Each time we watch it, we see and learn something new.
1373;Great movie with an amazing cast.
1374;The last portion of the movie is stupendous and the message rings as loud today as it has in the past.
1375;I saw the original in 1984 and loved it then.
1376;This director's cut is a bit longer and even better.
1377;needless to say, but worth saying, the music throughout is Mozart's and is so beautiful and inspiring anddelightful, I felt enraptured by it all.
1378;the costumes and sets are beautiful.
1379;This movie is the best I have ever seen.
1380;I absolutely fell in love with it.
1381;The costumes and scenery were the some of the best I have ever seen.
1382;This movie really takes you back to Mozart's century and makes you feel for both of the leading men.
1383;This movie is also very funny.
1384;There are a couple of scens that will make you chuckle and smile.
1385;The music is absolutely fabulous and is weaved into the movie beautifully.
1386;It definitely deserved its spot on the Top 100 films and will remain great.
1387;Amadeus is a gorgeous film, and I would very much like to enjoy the original in hi.
1388;as of now it's a choice between watching a pretty movie and a good movie.
1389;it is a great flic and I love the play and music.
1390;acting is superb as is also the staging
1391;A lot of people will disagree with me when I say something like that, and they may very well be right, but for my purposes, Amadeus is the greatest movie ever made, if one has the patience to sit through.
1392;more importantly, God does place the talent of music in a person who is not religious and does not believe.
1393;The only logical explanation he comes to realize is that Mozart is truly the voice of God.
1394;And as further punishment he keeps Salieri alive, to see that his once beloved music slips into mediocrity, while the music of Mozart is resurrected, so the speak.
1395;this kind of story is the mark of a truly great movie, and above the level of a petty movie about jealousy.
1396;For me, it is the best movie ever made, but I'm sure many people will have other things to say about that.
1397;The more I look at it the more hidden beauty I discover.
1398;Supreme art requires a great sacrifice.
1399;I loved the theater version more, but this is still a great Oscar winning movie.
1400;The movie is not a fact based biography however it is an enjoyable film.
1401;This was my second viewing and I was surprised that I enjoyed the film more this tine.
1402;in the beginning, the movie is very funny, portraying Mozart as a tallented, but badly.
1403;the movie has nice scenery, with clothing and stage props from Mozart's time.
1404;Amadeus the original release version is superior.
1405;It won Best Picture the year it came out, and was a big hit.
1406;I much prefer the original cut released in the theater.
1407;That the Hollywood corporations release special editions, and director's cuts is fine, but please keep the originals available.
1408;in short Director's cuts, and special editions often suck.
1409;Always I have considered Amadeus as one of the most amazing movies I have seen.
1410;After many years, I see again couple of night ago, and still I have the same opinion.
1411;Over the top in every way, but it works.
1412;Poor Salieri: he loathes Mozart, is wickedly jealous of him, but can't help but admire his genius and virtuosity .
1413;The music is sublime, the sets lavish, costuming is incredible .
1414;a pomp and circumstance of a film that manages to put a very human face on these famous and infamous personalities.
1415;It really is one of the top ten films made after 1980 .
1416;a gorgeous, engrossing, funny, hugely entertaining achievement.
1417;AND the Director's Cut that was released a few years later.
1418;makes it a better film.
1419;With all due respect to Milos Forman, the original theatrical version is VASTLY SUPERIOR to the Director's Cut.
1420;The storytelling is tighter, the film more engrossing.
1421;If you've never seen the film, I envy you .
1422;Had seen the movie a long time ago and loved f. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce who were both extremely good.
1423;I have seen theater release and it was a fun movie about envy.
1424;I have watched it over the years many times but was surprised by the Director's Cut.
1425;i would recommend this version over any other.
1426;I was mezmerized watching F. Murray Abrahams masterful performance which won him an Oscar.
1427;If this movie dosent make you a Mozart fan, It will certainly make you an F. Murray Abraham fan.
1428;Amadeus is still fresh in my mind and likely to remain so forever.
1429;This is a testament to it's enduring greatness.
1430;The genious behind this movie is the way the author combined fact and fiction into one hellava entertaining story.
1431;Amadeus won 8 oscars and each was justified, believe me!
1432;Excellent movie and excellent music
1433;In telling the priest his story, Salieri becomes the movie's narrator as well as its soul and wit, while Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, remains something of an enigma.
1434;"before it split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia), costumes, and other period evocations are flawless, and the music is rapturous, in particular the performance of Mozart's ""Requiem"" at the finale."
1435;best known as Ed Rooney, the sourpuss of a high school principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off .
1436;gives the performance of his career as Emperor Joseph II.
1437;This is a fascinating glimpse into the life of Mozart.
1438;The characters are exceptionally memorable and although F. Murray Abraham won an academy award, I think Tom Hulse earned one as well.
1439;This is worth the watch for the music alone.
1440;Overall this is a great movie because of the scenery, costumes and most of all the music, which the real star of the performance.
1441;"This may be the perfect film, (I know I said pretty much the same thing about ""Charade"", but.)"
1442;This is one of the few deserving films to actually receive the Academy Awards (r) that were mandated for it!
1443;up is flawless, making it very easy to believe that Abraham is seventy+ years old as he parlays the role.
1444;The very first lines you hear after a massive Beethovenish chord is sounded at the start of the film.
1445;"Little does Mozart realize that the ""deserving soul"" is himself!Maybe the ONLY thing askew about this incredible film is the odd miscasting of Mozart and Emperor Joseph."
1446;His portrayal of Mozart as a complete horse's ass is perfect for Peter Schaeffer's purposes.)
1447;"Elizabeth Berridge's Constanza Mozart is cute and Berridge assays her as a type of person that American audiences would be immediately comfortable with, a kind of eighteenth century ""Shirley Feeney""."
1448;the sense of humor and the acting of even supernumeraries in the production has to be seen to be believed.
1449;(The scene in Schickenader's vaudeville house being an excellent example.)
1450;time favorite movies about the genius that is Mozart.
1451;The acting in this movie is phenomenal and the music is obviously the best there is.
1452;The story plays with history in an interesting way and makes for an engrossing plot.
1453;Milos Forman's Amadeus is a hugely entertaining adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play.
1454;Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's.
1455;The film explores this angle of the legend.
1456;Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time.
1457;His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful.
1458;He is in constant debt.
1459;This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem.
1460;F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri.
1461;He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen.
1462;Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart.
1463;He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role.
1464;The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor.
1465;The new director's cut adds 20 minutes of footage, but the real standout is the remastered sound.
1466;The Dolby 5.1 version brings alive the sounds of Mozart in brilliant detail.
1467;who was a good composer in his own right.
1468;Had to watch for school and I must say it was very entertaining.
1469;The characters were well developed and great at leaving you wanting more.
1470;This film is as much a masterpiece of filmmaking genius as a Mozart sonata is a masterpiece of musical genius.
1471;Peter Shaffer, in adapting his brilliant script to a screenplay, maintained the position of Salieri as semi.
1472;The film has a bit of Fatal Attraction in it.
1473;Salieri loves and despises Mozart's music and genius.
1474;tom Hulce, as Mozart, delivers an amazing portrayal of a genius that makes you care for, sympathize with, and admire Mozart as a person, while also truly maddening you with his childishness and idiosyncracies until you dislike him just as much as Salieri does.
1475;His dual portrait is true and lifelike.
1476;the marriage of Mozart's music to this film is utterly amazing and complete.
1477;amadeus is, in short, a beautiful film of genius, obsession, betrayal, revenge and glorious.
1478;immortal music that you must see.
1479;Great acting and glorious music.
1480;This is a story about one of my favorite composers, and this director's cut version answered a lot of questions I had from the original version such as why Mozart's wife Constanze hated the sight of Salieri at the end.
1481;he was so talented and so young with a wife who loved him dearly, yet his childhood, and his father, and life at the royal court was hard on him combine with heavy drinking and partying which led to money troubles.
1482;I'm just glad that his music survives from one of the world's true musical geniuses.
1483;Better presentation of the movie
1484;ray copy of the original cut, but it is still a great film.
1485;While this story is not in the least backed up by any known history, it is a powerful, fascinating, and intriguing myth about the relationship between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
1486;The director's cut fills in some blanks left by the theatrical release, and the Blu Ray version is simply beautiful to watch.
1487;The music is Mozart and such a pleasure to listen to.
1488;This is an outstanding movie that should please the history buffs, the costume drama buffs, and, especially, the music buffs.
1489;The story of Mozart is compelling enough but the writer and director found an angle to view his life that reaches a level of excellence rarely seen in movie biographies.
1490;known Abraham got his Best Acting Oscar for portraying Mozart.
1491;this angle of viewing Mozart through the eyes of a jealous composer humanizes Mozart so well that a person can't help but be touched even more so by his life.
1492;In the midst of this brilliant script is a bountiful gift of Mozart's music and it is delivered in just the right dose and just the right visual accompaniment.
1493;It is a reminder that artistry well.
1494;focussed has an appeal all its' own.
1495;for the first time I realized how much good editing can contribute to a film.
1496;"all in all, ""Amadeus"" with or without the added scenes, is in my opinion, one of the great films of all time."
1497;The original theatrical release was masterfully edited.
1498;The acting is great, and the music is beyond beautiful!
1499;i've already recommended it to family members.
1500;F. Murray Abraham's performance and the score of this film make it an excellent piece.
1501;"This is the director's cut version of the critically acclaimed movie, ""Amadeus,"" which premiered in 1984."
1502;this is a wonderful movie.
1503;The acting is superb, it is visually beautiful, and of course the music is beyond words.
1504;i actually bought the movie for my grandson to enjoy when he gets older.
1505;In the meantime, my son watched it and loved it too.
1506;Amadeus is doubtless one of the finest movies ever made and the actors' performances are riveting.
1507;(The soundtrack is terrific, though.)
1508;I watch for entertainment, for historical accuracy and for sheer fascination with a portrayal of characters that intrigue me.
1509;The updated commentary make this classic all the more enjoyable.
1510;The documentary sheds a lot of light on the film and how it came to be.
1511;It is an inspired film of intelligence, probing psychological depth, and gripping darkness.
1512;I've always been such an eclectic person, listening to everything from rock to classical, and absorbing myself in the lives of the great composers (Bach, Mozart, etc.) No other life in musical history is as mysterious as Mozart's, and this film brings his life.
1513;back to life.You must understand this is a work that is hard to classify as fact or fiction.
1514;But the movie, is still a treasure.
1515;The beautifully preserved Nostitz Theater in the film is even the same theater where Mozart premiered his opera Il Don Giovanni in 1789, arguably the best opera yet written.
1516;This opera (and many others) are represented in the film, carefully and masterfully choreographed by Twyla Tharp who tried, very succesfully, to recapture the dances of the 18th Century.
1517;Amadeus is cerainly a treat for the eyes, as well as the ears and mind.
1518;Everything in the film looks just perfect: from the number of candles in the chandeliers, to the wigs, to the music, to the way the people talk.
1519;The Director's Cut has been rated R for brief nudity.
1520;This movie is a truly masterpiece.
1521;I've watched this movie several times and love it every time.
1522;The acting and the screenwriting are both excellent but the story, itself, is tragic in the end.
1523;The cinematography and production are first rate.
1524;I'm sure I'll watch it many more times in the future.
1525;All that needs to be said about this movie is that it may have been fictionalized to the max about poor Mozart, but it was one of the most enjoyable bio films I've ever seen in all my life and I've seen literally thousands of movies starting with the first sound pix in 1928.
1526;My best friend in San Francisco in the early 1950s saw 24 full.
1527;I was transfixed by this fillm which was perfectly cast and a delightful experience.
1528;The interplay between him and his ongoing feud with God was brilliant as was the conflict over why this creature Mozart was blessed with such heavenly and seemingly effortless talents, when he himself was destined for mediocrity and anonymity despite working so hard and devoting his very life to God.
1529;Do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful film.
1530;I first saw this movie when it was released, and I was so enthralled with it.
1531;It is just as majestic today as it was in the theater many years ago.
1532;I am still just as in love with the music, singers, dancers, costumes, location, editing, actors.
1533;but Milos Forman's explanation makes it more bearable.
1534;I thought the movie was very good, actually.
1535;If he laughed like that when he had a few drinks.
1536;Still, I did enjoy the movie and the actors did well around the main character, who also did well.
1537;I know it won a bunch of Oscars and it seemed to me a worthy winner.
1538;Total artistic license on the storyline but thoroughly entertaining.
1539;I watched this when it first came out and enjoyed it more this time around.
1540;The original cut was perfect.
1541;Amadeus is, in my view, the perfect motion picture.
1542;Once one considers all aspects of filmmaking, Amadeus is clearly one of the finest films ever produced, perhaps THE finest.
1543;Perhaps we'll see some trailers in a day or so.
1544;Great music from the Maestro.
1545;This movie ''Amadeus'' is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!
1546;I watch it all the time!
1547;I can memorize practically the entire movie!
1548;This is a beautiful portrayal of the life and works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
1549;May Mozart's spirit and music be with us all forever!
1550;This is one of the best movies ever made, full stop.
1551;When you watch the director's cut you come to appreciate how essential editing can be.
1552;The best example is in the greatest scene in any movie to depict genius.
1553;Salieri looks at the manuscripts and sees they are completely perfect .
1554;It is as if Mozart received dictation from heaven.
1555;The scene is completely convincing.
1556;The dramatic impact and focus on Mozart's extraordinary brilliance is completely lost.
1557;Both the production values and the music are magnificent.
1558;In 1984, it received Academy Awards for best director (Milos Forman) and leading actor (F. Murray Abraham) as well as for adapted screenplay, art direction, costume design, makeup, and sound.
1559;It was also nominated for cinematography and deserved that award also, losing out to The Killing Fields.
1560;Unlike other films such as The Red Shoes which also offers so much that is pleasing to the eye and ear, Amadeus has a complicated plot which involves equally complicated human relationships, notably Mozart's with Salieri and with his father Leopold Mozart (Roy Doltrice).
1561;The supporting cast is first.
1562;There is so much to enjoy in this film even as Mozart's health deteriorates.
1563;Yes, the disapproval and resentment remain but I also sense a certain pride in his association with the young genius.

1565;will be remembered and cherished.
1566;"minute documentary, ""The Making of Amadeus."""
1567;acting,story line, musical score all superior.
1568;the emotion conjured up watching this story awakens your soul.
1569;What a marvel the storytelling and camerawork are, this film holds up very well!
1570;Amadeus is an entertaining story about Mozart and his music.
1571;The scenes and photography are wonderful and the music sublime.
1572;This is a long film and my wife and I watched it together and we enjoyed killing off a Saturday afternoon that was too dreary outside to do anything else with!
1573;Good movie, and it got better, I can't believe they pulled it off.
1574;Strangely, only Salieri can recognize the sheer genius in his work.
1575;this was a great story, in every way.
1576;If the flick has a villain, it's Amadeus himself .
1577;Near the end of the film, the script works up an amazing conceit .
1578;As Mozart's powers ebb, he musters his genius to one last masterwork, one last stab at greatness that he actually has to work for rather than await as a divine gift.
1579;Amadeus is a glorious work in itself.
1580;Sumptuous music, scenes and costuming are brilliantly matched with nuanced and honest performances.
1581;Director Milos Foreman crowns this by having his cast .
1582;done up as they are in period costume and setting .
1583;I love music an off course Mozart, I love the dialogs and all the mistery in the history for this musician
1584;The movie had a slash through both the case and the case cover through the top right corner.
1585;The disc was perfectly fine, and I loved the movie, but I was surprised to see such a violent cut across the product.
1586;This 1984 Milos Forman film was so popular and successful that it won Best Picture that same year.
1587;The film is lush and engaging as a historical period movie and even serves as a colorful introduction to the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the greatest composer of the Classical Era (1750.1820).
1588;The movie does heighten the drama and makes fictional twists on the real life of Mozart.
1589;He was made of music.
1590;Salieri was respected and much more beloved in his time than Mozart.
1591;Salieri even taught such great names as Beethoven, Schubert and Franz Liszt.
1592;f. Murray Abraham really delivers the performance of his life as the villainous and bitter Salieri.
1593;Salieri makes it his life.
1594;The performances are excellent, the script is terrific and the look of the film authentically 18th century.
1595;The constant winner though is the music!!
1596;I've watched this movie many times and will watch it many more.
1597;The things that hold my interest in a movie are great acting, lots of humor to temper the human condition portrayed, and the music, of course, is wonderful.
1598;This story is based on 'urban legend' and I hope it is not true.
1599;I saw this movie awhile back and it was an amazing movie.
1600;See, it's movies like this that make me proud to be a classical music fan.
1601;No, this is simply a massively entertaining film, one that takes Mozart out of the Dora Stock silverpoint drawing and brings all of his charm, his anger, and his passion to life.
1602;This is called a period piece, but the truth is, the emotions and ideas expressed by Mozart et al. hold true even today.
1603;Filled with subtle humor and the enormity of one man's quest for revenge against God and the universe, this is a movie you'll enjoy even if you hate Mozart.
1604;If you love Mozart, it could be the most perfect movie ever.
1605;The theatrical release won 8 academy awards including Best Picture not Director's cut which truly would've ruined this picture.
1606;I'm not surprised at all that it one the Oscar for Best Picture (1984) and is included in AFI's Top 100 Films of all time.
1607;Even at three hours the music alone is enough to mesmerize you.
1608;Add superb acting and a superior story and you have 'Amadeus'.
1609;I highly recommend this film.
1610;with that in mind, it is easy to set this film apart from other directors cuts, because you are seeing an original vision, not one created for profit.
1611;It's simply another way to look at the material.
1612;Though not for the family, adults and older teens will no doubt enjoy the added complexity of the film.
1613;I no longer enjoy watching the original having seen this new DC once.
1614;And, I'm someone who always loved DC.
1615;place scenes from the movie in 1985 was brilliant.
1616;It's beyond my comprehension that the same person who directed such a masterpiece wanted those awful scenes included.
1617;The Director's Cut does allow for greater character development of Salieri.
1618;And we see that Salieri has quite the sweet tooth as he's munching on some delicacy in most scenes.
1619;"The reason I'm still giving the Director's Cut 5 stars is because I love this movie and am glad that we fans have an alternate (though less ""perfect"") version of this cinematic masterpiece."
1620;The cast interviews (20 or so years after making the movie) were a pleasure to watch, and we're given lots of inside information.
1621;screen animosity to keep up the spirit of their characters during filming.
1622;Milos and Peter Shaffer speak about being humbled by this third character and how they were both overwhelmed by the music's beauty.
1623;even if this movie betrays several glitches in historical accuracy, it is both moving and entertaining.
1624;This movie exposed a generation to this great music and the man.
1625;I do recommend the Director's Cut, but please keep the original release in your collection!
1626;Amadeus is an incredible film.
1627;The soundtrack is beautiful too.
1628;I remember watching it years ago on TV when I was a little girl.
1629;I wanted to introduce my 13 year old son to classical music and knew this movie would do the trick.
1630;I fell in love with this movie when I first experienced it in the fifth grade.
1631;Now an adult, I can appreciate it all the more.
1632;A powerful depiction of one of history's most fascinating characters, Amadeus is a film you'll return to over and over again.
1633;the cast is well chosen, although you may find the hit and miss accents bothersome if you're a stickler for authenticity.
1634;Portrayals of Emperor Joseph and his court sidekicks are entertaining, if a bit superficial (though I don't think it detracts from the story).
1635;"F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is superb
1636;precisely the picture painted of him in Amadeus.
1637;historic accuracy issues aside, this is an all time great film.
1638;It will engross you and leave you exhausted.
1639;Excellent renditions of Mozart's music are skillfully and seamlessly woven into the plot and heighten the drama.
1640;assisted Requiem composition scene is a powerful and unforgettable classic of cinematic brilliance.
1641;Mozart, has the talent but, in Salieri's eyes, is unworthy of the gift.
1642;f. Murray Abraham is brilliant as Salieri.
1643;The scenes where he plays an aged Salieri and the scene in which he renounces God are very stirring.
1644;The image of the old composer's face seamlessly flowing from a look of musical rapture to a snarl of envy saturated hatred gives me chills every time I see it.
1645;the film opens spectacularly, with Salieri screaming Mozart against a black screen.
1646;With an amazing economy, the film, directed by Milos Forman (and adapted Paul Shaffer from his own stage work) establishes a world of wondrous palaces, hyper.
1647;elaborate dress, and astounding music.
1648;No mere costume drama, Amadeus drops the viewer deep into the late 18th century in Vienna, then one of the most powerful cities in Europe and a cultural touchstone for the Western world.
1649;salieri, with his crabbed hands and scratchy voice, tells of his early years, when he promises his soul to God in return for the ability to make music to honor God.
1650;So Salieri is free to pursue his love of music, and it appears that God has granted Salieri his wish .
1651;Even more horrifying, Salieri realizes that Mozart is more talented than he .
1652;perfect note, as the screen dissolves to final black, we again hear Mozart's aggravating, infuriating high.
1653;Amadeus throws us into the mania of composition for both Mozart and Salieri, the world of court intrigues, and the triumphs and agonies of success and failure for composers.
1654;This is a powerful film with a surprisingly dark theme, but it is required viewing for any fan of classical music.
1655;Director, producer, actors, costumiers .
1656;everyone having anything to do with this film richly deserve all accolades bestowed and more.
1657;THE MAGIC FLUTE is a quiet , subtle piece?
1658;here's the deal: certain works of art are subtle"

1663;Beyond that, it boasts fine performances from a talented cast, with all the juicy melodrama that they can sink their teeth into.
1664;*Amadeus* is a popular . . . yes, POPULAR (loud, pushy, c.) classic for the ages.
1665;I have loved this movie since I was a kid.
1666;There are many scenes that were cut out and seeing them provided a new depth to the characters.
1667;One of those movies you will remember forever.
1668;He speaks with so much love and passion until it is turned to hate.
1669;Despite the many protests from scholars and Mozart fans alike regarding the accuracies or inaccuracies of this film to Mozart's true biography, the viewer still cannot help but be moved, inspired, and entertained all in one fell swoop!One of the marks of a true classic is something that stands up to the test of time.
1670;Amadeus fits the definition as much as Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, and many other films that are still watched and discussed to this day.
1671;amadeus celebrates one of the true musical geniuses ever to walk the Earth.
1672;What makes this fact even more compelling, is the number of his works that are considered by many scholars, critics, and fans alike as some of the best music ever written.
1673;this film is a tour de force as far as acting goes.
1674;F. Murray Abraham gives one of the best performances in film history as the likeable, yet envious Antonio Salieri who finds his own works to always be secondary to Mozart.
1675;done, Tom Hulce is fantastic as Mozart.
1676;Hulce himself practiced on the piano for four hours each day so that he would appear convincing on film.
1677;The cackling laugh of his still brings a smile every time you hear it.
1678;Salieri has taken drastic steps to please himself before God, who he hopes will embue him with the ability to write """"perfect"""" music."""
1679;He's looking for an inspiring.
1680;This movie is very good.
1681;I highly recommend your viewing!
1682;Just the concept of the package was very good.
1683;An interesting look at Mozart's life from the perspective of a rival composer.
1684;Beautifully filmed and interwoven with wonderful music.
1685;Sometimes hilarious, sometimes somber and always tragic, this is the highly entertaining dramatized story of Mozart.
1686;A fictional story about the tragic life of a real.
1687;the wardrobes, backdrops and everything you see in this film are breathtakingly accurate and believable.
1688;The acting is flawless by every single person you see on screen, whether it's the un.
1689;the music is incredible and you'll never hear these pieces the same after you see them being performed on screen.
1690;A behind the scenes featurette would have also been wonderful.
1691;Nonetheless, this is one of the top films ever made and a must.
1692;This movie turned out to be a very good.

1698;this is a truly epic film based on Peter Shaeffers's play, which tells the story of Mozart from the point of view of the aged Court Composer Salieri, looking back.
1699;Tom Hulse gives a fine performance as Mozart, but I always felt that there was more artistic licence in his performance than in Abrahams.
1700;the music is superbly performed and the operatic settings deserve special mention.
1701;Certainly this film gives you every opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary talent that Mozart was blessed with.
1702;The music and performances are fact and that is enough for me.
1703;This is just absolutely great.
1704;Grand film, great set, awesome packaging, worth the price.
1705;"I won't go into any explanation of why Amadeus is a great movie
1706;What I do want to touch on is the new """"Director's Cut"""":First off, the transfer is excellent."""
1707;Not too much color in this film except when we are in the emperor's court, the opera stage and the robes of the archbishop, but in those more lit scenes the colors are vibrant.
1708;But then, the original Amadeus had a fine transfer as well.
1709;as for the extra scenes: they fit into the whole seemlessly.
1710;and applause during performances, but this is certainly a treat nonetheless.
1711;the LFE .1 channel got some good use.
1712;Milos talking about returning to his homeland after becoming declared persona non grata is worth watching.
1713;The trailor: great to see how such a great movie can have such a stupid trailor.
1714;Fully deserving of it's 8 awards.
1715;This film really has it all.
1716;This is one of my favorite movies.
1717;I got hooked after watching the first quarter of it in school.
1718;This movie was absolutely fabulous.
1719;This movie captivated me, and I could not stop watching it.
1720;In this movie, he explains the triumph, the heartaches, the life, and the death of Mozart.
1721;the way the story is told is incredible.
1722;The costumes, the music, the make.
1723;up, everything in this movie is perfect.
1724;They did a great job.
1725;Good depiction of one of our most treasured composers.
1726;The sets and music were just gorgeous.
1727;brillant and love deleted scenes.
1728;superb acting by entire cast.
1729;While the whole movie is clearly focused on Mozart's genius, I soon developed a strong empathy with Abraham's Salieri, feeling a compassion I don't usually feel for any fictional characters.
1730;Salieri is constantly tortured by Mozart's superior achievements, odiously hating his rival, and yet, respecting him and admiring his work as if divine, directly dictated by God, since he believes Mozart is God's chosen composer.
1731;"This struggle has its peak in the simply beautiful 3 minute sequence with Salieri reading the music brought to him by Mozart's wife, mentally hearing every note while standing in hate, envy and awe of his rival's genius, which he understood and loved better than anyone else, and yet, kept reminding him of his own mediocrity as if some sort of God's cruel joke, finally ending with Saliery burning the crucifix while accusing God ""."
1732;One of the strongest sequences about the human struggle between corrosive envy and absolute admiration I remember watching in movies.
1733;"while normally not my kind of movie, I had to admit I enjoyed watching it, and soon forgot about all the fiction (or at least apocryphal events) being told about Mozart's life
1734;This is a wonderful movie!
1735;The cinematography, acting, and script are wonderful.
1736;I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes classical music!
1737;Amadeus is one of my favorite films.
1738;the most impressive part of this version is the added scenes throughout the film.
1739;It is for these scenes alone that you should see this cut.
1740;Being a film of Mozart there is music and lots of it.
1741;One way to descibe it is early digital.
1742;Bring some aspirin with you.
1743;It was truly a great movie as it was.
1744;So please don't deprive us with this Director's Cut only!
1745;This movie weaves history, comedy, drama into an unforgettable masterpiece!
1746;This production is quite lavish.
1747;Listening to the commentary of F. Murray Abraham about how he played the role is great.
1748;The scenes included in director's cut makes the movie make more sense.
1749;everyone is so heightened in this film, and then to celebrate the music.
1750;it is such a glorious film, so well cut and directed, and literate.
1751;and to have it high definition to watch or listen to whenever is just so exquisite a gift of our technology.
1752;I saw this film in a theatre in England as a boy and it was one of the highlights of my movie going youth.
1753;He was absolutely shocking in this movie as a portrayal of one of the greatest composers / humans ever to live.
1754;What it does capture though, is period set design, wardrobe and atmosphere and it does it so well that any story told within this shell could be utterly believable and engrossing.
1755;however, all these things aside, this is an incredibly strong film to say the least and one of my all time favourites.

1760;Salieri holds Mozart in high regard.
1761;The movie displays the why of this admiration, as seen through the many good musical performances in the movie.
1762;Salieri longs for the same talent, and the beginning of the movie provides a very compelling preface as to the origins of this respect.
1763;On the other hand, I found myself admiring Mozart's musical compositions that were performed in the movie.
1764;I also felt empathy for the circumstances leading to Salieri's wish to enjoy the same popularity as Mozart.

1771;This film is really quite famous in its way.
1772;It does take liberties with history to make a more engaging story but has fine acting and incredible music.

1786;This is an awesome period peice, good story with well.

1788;I enjoyed this Director's cut, as it put to rest certain questions I had about the regular movie, especially why Mozart's wife hated Soliare so much.
1789;But its worth viewing at least once, if you have the same kind of curiosity I did.
1790;This film is still fabulous.
1791;The acting is amazing as is the theme.
1792;And, what a performance he gives!
1793;This is a serious piece and I didn't think either had the depth as an actor to pull it off.

1796;It was most interesting"
1797;"It was dynamic
1798;And to top it all off, it was very funny and ironic.
1799;This film deserves a second or third look especially if it has been a while since you have seen it.
1800;Although it's historical fiction, it's still a fun and interesting way to receive a bit of education on one of the world's most brilliant composers: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
1801;it also delivers a great message.
1802;And the costuming and acting are so worth the watching.
1803;I have seen very few operas, but this still remains one my very favorite films.
1804;It's wonderfully done in every way.
1805;It's really a great story.
1806;note melody, he produces a high.
1807;the bitterness and jealousy of Salieri towards Mozart is the subject of Milos Forman's brilliant film """"Amadeus"""", which explores not just the greatness of Mozart's music but the mediocrity of Salieri's."""
1808;"One of the most enduring lines in the movie is Salieri's question to the priest who is hearing his confession: ""Why would God put the lust to compose in my body and then deny me the talent?"""
1809;one of the most interesting sequences in the movie is when Salieri goes to a concert of Mozart's in Vienna to seek him out.
1810;Every movement by Abraham is a master stroke of acting.
1811;He won the Academy Award for Best Actor as this role, and it is no surprise.
1812;As a man who loved music but simply lacked the talent, Salieri was a man of incredible depth with several conflicts.
1813;playing opposite Abraham is Tom Hulce as one of the greatest geniuses of all time.
1814;Instead, he used it as a crutch as he highly criticized and made fun of other composers.
1815;The funniest scene in the movie (did I happen to mention that this movie is hilarious) is when Salieri is spying on Mozart at a party where the latter is being asked requests to play music from other composers.
1816;But as he plays, he starts making fun of Salieri's physical output and the hard work that the court composer put into making the music.
1817;another one of my favorite elements of the film is the costume design.
1818;"The costume as well as the art direction and set pieces help to make ""Amadeus"" one of the greatest films set in 18th century Europe."
1819;but aside from the comic humor and design, this is a film about forgiveness.
1820;His flashback is the amazing story of how he knew Mozart and how the music has affected him.
1821;the scene where Salieri assists Mozart in writing the Requiem Mass is the best in the movie.
1822;His wife locks away the music and forces Salieri out.
1823;and I still don't feel like I found the good in it that prompted the Academy Award or the positive views.
1824;top performance for purposes of melodrama.
1825;(As a Catholic, I believe both are probably aware of this film in the afterlife.)
1826;In fact, the only way in which he even changes at the end is that he's found a new outlet for his supreme arrogance.
1827;and claims that we are all equally loved by God.
1828;it felt more like it actually was about Mozart's life, even though Salieri is telling it.
1829;The biggest pleasure that I can see getting from this movie.
1830;and it's a guilty pleasure.
1831;is in criticizing it, is in putting it in its place.
1832;But without that, what possible good can come out of watching this film?The only legitimate pleasure I got was learning something in the way of Mozart's life and how it inspired the music that he wrote, but I could have gotten that from a documentary.
1833;And while I can and must credit this film with that, I'd rather that it be a better film that did that.
1834;The only good that could come from it you can get in other ways.
1835;A story of pure genius.
1836;A movie that is as fantastic as its subject matter.
1837;The video and music sound played perfectly but when the actors spoke there was no sound at all.
1838;It's a fiction based on real historical caracters.
1839;People in his time were well aware of his genius.
1840;guarde and it took some time for people to warm up to it.
1841;Do your research on Mozart and the music of the late 1700's and you will see how aware people were of his talents.
1842;He got married at the age of 24, and raised a ridiculously big number of children.
1843;And for those who accept the work as fiction, and care only to appreciate it as one, here are my comments on it:.
1844;I will hinder and harm your creature on earth as far as I am able!
1845;"And that beautiful climax around the end of the movie where you see Mozart laying dumped in that pauper's grave with white smoke seemingly emanating from it and the Lacrymosa sounding it's ""Amen"" at the end of the piece."
1846;He thought that God killed Mozart to prevent him from stealing the Requiem.
1847;puts his hands on his heart as he hears God still laughing at him just before the credits roll.
1848;There's also a sublime moment in the movie whose beauty you only notice the second time you watch the film.
1849;In this moment, you are given a hint that Salieri's truth about God having killed Mozart to prevent his hogging the glory for the Requiem might be true.
1850;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1851;If you want to see this movie, then the Director's Cut is the way to go.
1852;It was fun to watch for the additional scenes.
1853;Though the extra scenes made it long it was worth ever minute.
1854;Brilliant movie about a brilliant man.
1855;based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce.
1856;This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham.
1857;This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen.
1858;Congrats to Amadeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.
1859;"Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about."
1860;"he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming!"
1861;"smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with an emotionless face ""I didn't."
1862;Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.
1863;tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it.
1864;He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent.
1865;He marries Constance played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well.
1866;It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly.
1867;"Salieri is especially rich in this regard
1868;There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service.
1869;Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.
1870;abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place.
1871;Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high.
1872;class as Constance, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good.
1873;Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good.
1874;naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.
1875;The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W. s. did so well.
1876;director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way.
1877;Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful.
1878;It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors.
1879;Few do this correctly, but when it is, it's truly magnificent and makes the film.
1880;The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism, as """"Amadeus"""" is one of the most beautifully constructed, eloquent films of the last twenty."""
1881;Truly exceptional, entertaining, and engrossing even if you aren't a Mozart fan or a devoted fan of music in general.
1882;"Milos Forman's movie ""Amadeus"" brings to life Peter Schaffer's play."
1883;Murray Abraham played the part of jealous Salieri brilliantly.
1884;Right from the beginning of the movie, the screenplay captivates you.
1885;This was put together beautifully with all the right pieces starting from the beginning to the Requiem to the ending of Salieri in the asylum with the piano piece.
1886;The cast starting from Jeffrey Jones to Simon Callow did a very good job with Elizabeth Berridge being the only sore part.
1887;Haydn remarked once that Mozart was the greatest composer of his time.
1888;and the background starts one of Mozart's greatest piano concertos, is partly a myth.
1889;The people in Mozarteum considered it a unique cultural contribution which did not diminish Mozart's achievements in any way and enhanced the interest of the world in classical music and in Mozart.
1890;This movie was wonderfully put together and people who saw it for the first time developed interest in areas of classical music such as opera.
1891;I, for one, consider that itself a success.
1892;The emotions of Salieri and his reactions to the music are passionately portrayed.
1893;"The ending dialog, ""I will speak for you father, I speak for all the mediocrities in the world."
1894;Every award this movie got is well justified.
1895;I for one like both the original and the director's cut.
1896;A love the movie Amadeus.
1897;The scenes, costuming and historical rendering a superb!
1898;The choice of actors and screen writing a superb.
1899;Some of them are good, adding details to the story.
1900;This is a great film and while it was interesting to see the additional scenes in the director's cut, I think I prefer the original release.
1901;Big fan of the movie theater version of this movie, so the Director's Cut adds more of the story that should have been in to begin with.
1902;Still worth the money, just be careful if you have kids.
1903;Great sets, acting and costumes.
1904;I enjoyed watching it this time as much or more than when I first saw it.
1905;I was very pleased with how fast it shipped.
1906;It was in great condition when it arrived!
1907;"I loved the two disc special edition ""Amadeus"" Movie!"
1908;Why is the wonderful theatrical cut of this film being withheld from a remastered (and one.
1909;I had not seen Amadeus in years and enjoyed so much to watch it again.
1910;It brings you into the environment of MozartMs times.
1911;Urban legend or not it makes a great story and the beautiful costumes and sets are so lush and yet so barren at times.
1912;F. Murray Abraham brings so much to this role so much spirit and substance and was so interested to find out that both Mick Jagger and Mel Gibson tried for role of Mozart but Tom Hulce was definitely the right choice he played the role to the hilt.
1913;enjoyable even after all of these years later.
1914;It asks me for 8 more words so I can submit.
1915;While it is filled with hollywood, it does shed some incite into the real character that was Mozart.
1916;I've always loved classical music, this movie only made it stick!
1917;I love how this movie talks about Amadeus life and death in an interesting manner.
1918;i enjoyed it and learn from it.
1919;Great Movie, but the viedo was interuped
1920;The film, Amadeus, is 5 STARS!
1921;This is a major disruption to the flow of the story.
1922;It is fuzzy, with fine lines and blips running through it.
1923;Okay, this is obviously one of the best movies that I have EVER seen.
1924;Many reviewers before me have showered praise, upon which I will decline to add, since the world over knows Mozart's genius.
1925;1) The movie is historically inaccurate (although much of the story is based on well known facts).
1926;3) This one is my favorite.
1927;Because Mozart had a cool sounding middle name?
1928;This is a fantastically woven tale.
1929;All instruments, vocals etc. wassocially inept, loved the ladies and drink.
1930;It is interesting what a person can and will do because of jealousy , envy ,resentment and down right hate.
1931;this film is worth watching more than once.
1932;a tour de force, bravo!!!
1933;You watch this realizing what a visual and aural treat you're in for.
1934;F Murray Abraham won the Oscar for this role and deservedly so.
1935;Tom Hulce is excellent too as the driven composer, who seems to not have fully grown up except for the music.
1936;Nevertheless, it is a great movie, one of my favorites.
1937;This gives us not only a great transfer and a one.
1938;all appropriate for one of the best films to come out of the 1980's!
1939;This edition, with the extra scenes and choice of three languages, is excellent.
1940;Further, the extra disc, concerning the making of Amadeus in 1988 Prague, before the fall of the Soviet Empire, has some really hilarious moments.
1941;I loved imagining the KGB spies, who were extras in the audiences, confusion.
1942;As well as the pranks played on them by the stage crews.
1943;This is one of my all time favorite movies!!!
1944;I was unfamiliar with the urban tale of Antonio SalIeri causing Mozart's death (or at least that's what he thought supposidly) so it was fun and interesting to watch.
1945;the acting, costumes, scenery are absolutely magical.
1946;I believe F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for his performance and Tom Hulce (as Mozart) was nominated as well.
1947;The movie went on to win more Oscars including Best Picture/Best Director (1984).
1948;mozart's glorious music performed by Sir Neville Mariner's St Martin.
1949;fields symphony is truly inspiring.
1950;Those unfamiliar with his music will be entranced as it is played throughout the entire movie.
1951;One piece (Mozart's Lacrimosa from his Requiem) was a piece I taught my own church choir.
1952;Amadeus is truly one of the greatest films of all time and one of the greatest I've ever seen.
1953;Amadeus never looked better and since it's the Director's Cut, the entire movie is gloriously presented in high definition.
1954;The nice thing about this package is that it comes in a Blu Ray Book which is what it is, a book.
1955;the film itself is extraordinary.
1956;proclaimed rival of Mozarts and is deadly envious of Mozart's talent.
1957;The film is beautifully shot with gorgeous sets and costumes and the ever so amazing music of Mozart.
1958;F. Abraham Murray puts on an amazing performance in which his Oscar was well deserved.
1959;For Blu Ray owners, definitely get this one while it's on sale.
1960;It's a must have for true lovers of film.
1961;"While I perfer the latter for a number of reasons, the feeling and flow of the original theatrical version differs somewhat from the ""Director's Cut""."
1962;He ends up rejecting her when she shows that she so loves her husband that she would be willing to do so.
1963;A number of the opera scenes are extended as well with more business after the show between Mozart and his leading lady.
1964;"There's also a longer sequence involving Salieri's visit to Mozart comissioning the ""Requiem""."
1965;Most of the material adds to the power of the film while a few sequences just give additional back story on various characters.
1966;"Forman also provide a fascinating commentary track for the film along with writer Peter Shaffer (""Equus"")."
1967;release resulting in much more natural flesh tones and a sharper visual image as well.
1968;The colors which play in important part in conveying the themes of each sequence are more robust and vivid.
1969;"the second disc of the ""Director's Cut"" has one terrific extra, a brief talent list and the original theatrical trailer."
1970;At nearly 40 minutes it could have provided more background including outtakes, rehearsals and auditions but it's quite a few documentary as it is.
1971;Mozart (Oscar nominee Tom Hulce giving a terrific performance) was a child prodigy who composed his first piece at the age of 4 and produced a remarkably large body of work for such a brief life.
1972;His nemesis is court composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham in a remarkable performance).
1973;Salieri is so consumed with his jealousy, that while recognizing the beauty and originality of Mozart's music, he can't help but want to destroy its creator.
1974;Salieri's quaint compositions can't hold a candle to Mozart's complex, original and brilliant pieces.
1975;"The stunning production design, cinematography and sharp direction make ""Amadeus: The Director's Cut"" an experience worth savoring."
1976;The digital anamorphic transfer looks marvelous and almost rich enough to eat.
1977;This version doesn't replace the original theatrical version but is more of an enhanced experience for those who loved the first film.
1978;highly recommended, this examination of the destructive power of jealousy still resonates with power, passion and wonderful music.
1979;We see a lot of excerpts from a variety of Mozart's operas throughout the movie.
1980;Whichever version of the movie you choose, you'll sure to be delighted.
1981;"I'd give the ""Director's Cut"" a slight edge for better picture."
1982;This is my very favorite movie.
1983;The concept of seeing Mozart through the eyes of a competitor, Salieri, makes the story very poignant.
1984;Through Salieri's eyes we see and realize the magnificence of Mozart's musical creations.
1985;The acting and the costuming in this movie are superb.
1986;"I have watched it several times
1987;The director's cut really brings things to life, with the exquisite music, of course, taking center stage.
1988;Extremely well written, directed, acted, and edited.
1989;Great movie for any fan of classical music.
1990;Tells a good story while being able to keep your attention the whole time.
1991;I've been going to the movies for more than half a century, so I can state with absolute confidence that """"Amadeus"""" is one of the _the_ all."""
1992;"It's both wildly entertaining and abstractly ""perfect"" in a way that transcends verbal description."
1993;(The magnificent performances of Mozart's music by Sir Neville and The Academy don't hurt, either.)
1994;talented human being who appears to be the recipient of a very selective divine dispensation .
1995;most of us have experienced that feeling.
1996;Find the original if you can.
1997;interesting note: The original version is, as far as I know, the only PG.
1998;rated film with frontal male nudity.
1999;this film is amazing for many reasons: the music, F. Murray Abraham's (Antonio Salieri's) acting and the art of its costumes, architecture and color coordination.
2000;overall this film is wonderful.
2001;The clarity and scope of Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography was breathtaking .
2002;Amadeus is thoroughly contemporary filmmaking at its best.
2003;But what more can be added to the staggering accomplishment of the film itself?Much can be said about the performances, the writing, the music, Dick Smith's extraordinary old.
2004;In fact, Amadeus is a virtual catalog of best practices in each category.
2005;As gifted as they are, no other project has fit them so perfectly.
2006;Amadeus took on a life of its own, symbiotically fed off their unique talents and, in return, gave them each their most perfect expression.
2007;It is as though each artist was born specifically to contribute his or her unique vision to this film.
2008;While it does not break new ground, or even draw attention its own technique (like Eisentsein's Battleship Potempkin, for example), Amadeus nonetheless demonstrates that there is no more powerful a cinematic device than a perfectly executed cut from one shot to another.
2009;I bought this as a gift for my father who loves the movie.
2010;If you love the film and a curious, go for it, but you may feel, as I do, that you should have waited for the definitive presentation.
2011;This is a great movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time.
2012;"of"" documentary that is interesting, and not a whole lot else really."
2013;The packaging is okay, but again, nothing fantastic.
2014;Just the usual slim case with 2 discs inside with the easily.
2015;the version of the movie that won all of the awards.
2016;way through the movie, this version of the movie is far superior.
2017;"Just cut a few, and it will be perfect."""
2018;Apply this to the extra scenes in the Director's Cut .
2019;cut a few, and it will be perfect.
2020;Extra scenes or no, still a great movie, but the theatrical version is definitely superior.
2021;what we really need is a definitive version of Amadeus in a collector's tin, with documentaries, trailers, booklets, etc. etc. etc., with the extra scenes available if you want to watch them, but SEPARATE from the movie.
2022;If you like Mozart, you'll love this film.
2023;I really enjoy this movie is well done and well acted really good music created in the movie a must see.
2024;Story line is fascinating, characters very real, costumes/sets are completely over the moon fantastic and feel of an old European town .
2025;I watch this film, at least, once every two years.
2026;Tom Hulce does a fabulous job and truly did tug on many heartstrings.
2027;and you will love to hate Solieri!
