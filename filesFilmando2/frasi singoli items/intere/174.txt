I:19503;1;By day, he works as an inner city school teacher and basketball coach, doing his part to help his students break the cycle of poverty and make something of themselves.
I:19503;2;Somehow, Dunn is able to keep his deep dark secret hidden from the people at the school, until one night, after a game, he is found by one of his players completely strung out in a stall in the girls' locker room.
I:19503;3;Drey, an inquisitive but level.
I:19503;4;in his best role .
I:19503;5;"since ""The Believer"" in 2001, Ryan Gosling proves yet again why he is one of the truly outstanding actors of his generation."
I:19503;6;nominated work here is mesmerizing and heartbreaking, as his character goes about leading this strange double existence, turning Dunn into a complex individual who is part Mr. Peepers, part tragic hero.
I:19503;7;This not only provides Gosling with an opportunity to more thoroughly plumb the depths of his character but it makes the character himself more ambiguous and intriguing and thus much harder to read.
I:19503;8;gosling is matched by young Shareeka Epps, who proves herself a screen natural in her acting debut as Drey, a girl made wise beyond her years by the circumstances of an absent father, an overworked mother and an older brother serving time in prison.
I:19503;9;rate as a neighborhood drug.
I:19503;10;when he is spending most of his evenings in search of the ultimate high, but we'll have to chalk that up to suspension of disbelief and move on from there.
I:19503;11;"beautifully acted and exquisitely directed, ""Half Nelson"" is easily one of the best films of 2006."
I:19503;12;He takes his junior high history class through an impromptu exercise in history.
I:19503;13;He's also the girls' basketball coach.
I:19503;14;Drey keeps all things under her hat, and both coach and pupil develop a chummy relationship while Dan tries futilely to keep it professional.
I:19503;15;Gosling gives a worthy Oscar nominee performance showing the subtlety of drug addiction like few others.
I:19503;16;Shattering but subtle, 'Half Nelson' creeps up on the viewer as well as the protagonist with a sincere presentation.
I:19503;17;There's a lot to do in life.
I:19503;18;"many a review will tell you one thing about the ending
I:19503;19;Our society demands a happy ending.
I:19503;20;The realist in you tells you that what you are watching is unrealistic but the optimist in you tells you that all you have to do is believe and then `kicking drugs' will really be that easy.
I:19503;21;But, if you want a realistic film that broaches a dark subject with some intelligence and compassion then this is the film for you.
I:19503;22;`Half Nelson' tells the story of Dan Dunne, a young and energetic teacher who has a knack for reaching his students with his unique teaching style.
I:19503;23;Drey, one of his brightest students, is sweet by nature and sparks something close to curiosity in Dan.
I:19503;24;"Both Drey and Dan share a common bond
I:19503;25;i got you with that last part, huh?
I:19503;26;The whole `overcome it' statement.
I:19503;27;But, that does not mean that this is not an inspirational film.
I:19503;28;The way in which the addict and the inevitable dealer is handled is so beautifully understanding and realistic.
I:19503;29;the acting, as many have already mentioned, is impeccable.
I:19503;30;She walks toe to toe with Gosling (who managed a deserved Oscar nomination) and delivers a performance that is just as good as his.
I:19503;31;"I normally find this actor to be irritating, annoying and the worst part of a movie
I:19503;32;his best performance to date, by a country mile.
I:19503;33;"from the intimate and realistic script to the intimate and realistic performances, `Half Nelson' is a true independent gem of a film
I:19503;34;"One of the best films of the decade and truly one I will remember forever
I:19503;35;You can always count on Ryan Gosling to deliver the goods.
I:19503;36;He's also worth seeing in the under.
I:19503;37;"appreciated ""Stay"" (a movie you have to watch twice thanks to the jawdropping ending)."
I:19503;38;here, Gosling again shows why he's amongst the finest actors working today.
I:19503;39;Her portrayal of young 'Drey' is an eye.
I:19503;40;She has acting skills well beyond years.
I:19503;41;Mackie is a great actor as well.
I:19503;42;This is a brave actor willing to commit himself to a role.
I:19503;43;Ryan Gosling was justly praised for his fine delineation of a dynamic and committed inner city school teacher whose private life is spinning out of control due to his losing struggle with cocaine and crack.
I:19503;44;It is fine and subtle work and he conveys paragraphs of dialogue with a self.
I:19503;45;deprecating smile and hopeless exchange of looks with a caring and adoring student, beautifully played by Shareeka Epps, who has stumbled onto the facts of her inspiring teacher's contradictory sordid private life.
I:19503;46;The film gets that right, without being pedantic or preachy.
I:19503;47;What the film does illustrate is that addictive drugs can addict anyone, even smart and caring people, because they're addictive.
I:19503;48;in general, I dislike a lot of hand.
I:19503;49;It does lend some intimacy, and besides, a film like this is all about the characters and acting, not where the camera is at any given moment.
I:19503;50;The tension was perfectly done.
I:19503;51;This was my favorite aspect of this film and I think that both Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps did a fantastic job at maintaining that tension.
I:19503;52;the movie had some really funny moments, too, which I appreciated.
I:19503;53;I think that Ryan Gosling was just amazing.
I:19503;54;When he does something positive, he is so conflicted that it seems believable and genuine.
I:19503;55;really, just a great film.
I:19503;56;I think that Gosling creates Dan and gives him life and the rest of the cast of the film create the world that he lives in very convincingly.
I:19503;57;"This film is so intimate and well done that you feel like you are peeking through a keyhole
I:19503;58;"I particulary enjoyed istening to the commentary and appreciate the resourcefulness and ingenuity used by the film makers in getting this low budget project made, i. e., using their own cat, someones home (as a reward he was put into film), using actual kids from school, taking advantage of their ""down time"" which was filmed and added to the picture."
I:19503;59;"kudo's to the choice of Ryan Gosling, he is probably the best young actor around today
I:19503;60;The film was also unexpectedly funny, with any number of subtly wrought ironic turnarounds.
I:19503;61;gosling's performance of a drug.
I:19503;62;addled and lost soul is spot.
I:19503;63;His win at the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Actor was well deserved, as was his Academy Award nomination.
I:19503;64;the ending sequence is interesting if, again, a bit too vague.
I:19503;65;city surroundings and the tenderness of their difficult teacher.
I:19503;66;Anthony Mackie also shone as family friend and self.
I:19503;67;Frank's girlfriend shows potential as a possible female role model for Drey.
I:19503;68;A movie that had fine acting but little story.
I:19503;69;I cannot think of a reason Ryan Goslilng took on this role unless he just wanted to learn how to be a doper, but he surely played the role authentically and is very deserving of the Academy Award nomination.
I:19503;70;it broke my heart to watch this movie and I'm not sure I will watch it again very soon.
I:19503;71;If you watch this, bring a hankie.
I:19503;72;I really liked this movie.
I:19503;73;Though slow (as it should have been), it displayed the growing friendship between teacher and student, both in need of something beyond their normal lives.
I:19503;74;Ryan Gosling, a long way from his Mickey Mouse days, always impresses in every one of his roles.
I:19503;75;While some might say the film lacks a plot or traditional climax, the scenes in the bathroom and in the hotel room provide the viewer with those very climactic scenes, with those moments that leave you feeling like something within the characters have changed.
I:19503;76;Working in an urban school myself, I also love the message that students, from any background, can be challenged and rise up to the challenge.
I:19503;77;Another good movie about life,lessons and people.
I:19503;78;Half Nelson is one of those movies that's so courageously truthful that at times it's hard to keep your eyes on the screen.
I:19503;79;After the end credits rolled I shuffled out of the theatre still feeling its impact .
I:19503;80;ryan Gosling is outstanding as Dan, a dynamic eighth grade history teacher in a downward spiral of drug addiction.
I:19503;81;His young co. star Shareeka Epps is equally compelling as a student with her own share of problems.
I:19503;82;Even the minor characters are entirely convincing but Gosling is so good here that he'll make you flinch and probably even want to cry.
I:19503;83;The first internal shot of a Brooklyn school also features an alarm bell blaring in the background.
I:19503;84;And our first glimpse of teacher Dan Dunne's disheveled appearance (both at home and at work) is in itself alarming.You might think these signals serve as some kind of warning for the events to follow.
I:19503;85;And you would be right, to a point.
I:19503;86;uncomfortable lines, the movie itself is so good that it left me feeling wide awake and strangely refreshed .
I:19503;87;at least achieve a more manageable level of comfort inside of their strangling situations.
I:19503;88;there's the aforementioned Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling, in his second Oscar.
I:19503;89;"worthy performance along with his role in ""The Believer""), the wry, self."
I:19503;90;intelligent Drey (in a strikingly real performance by first.
I:19503;91;time actress Shareeka Epps, who deserved an Oscar Nomination far more than Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin ever did), attempting to negotiate her way through an obstacle.
I:19503;92;though they're both loners at heart, they forge a bond from an unorthodox yet catalyzing moment, when Drey catches Dan doing drugs in the school bathroom.
I:19503;93;"And when Dan finally feels well enough to ask his student, ""Can you help me up?"""
I:19503;94;Because this is one of those films where the acting is so good that there's no need for a lot of expositional dialog (which is my least favorite kind).
I:19503;95;So the actors in this case say a lot more about their histories and relationships with their eyes, faces and postures than they ever could with their words.
I:19503;96;and the editing is smart enough to follow suit and take its cues from the streamlined, non.
I:19503;97;This really helps to keep a film without a lot of plotting from becoming too plodding.
I:19503;98;amusing outtakes, 4 minutes of wisely.
I:19503;99;Good movie but not great like everyone says it is.
I:19503;100;Great acting by everyone in the film.
I:19503;101;"See ""Half Nelson"" for the terrific acting on display."
I:19503;102;Ryan Gosling is superb as the inspirational inner city middle school history teaches fighting personal demons, not the least crack addiction.
I:19503;103;The acting was good just the movie sucked.
I:19503;104;key, mesmerizing performance by Ryan Gosling.
I:19503;105;In supporting roles, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie give superb, if less nuanced, performances.
I:19503;106;"It's all very real, down to the women cast as Gosling's love interests
I:19503;107;"And that's what makes ""Half Nelson"" so effective."
I:19503;108;Ryan Gosling was pretty amazing in Half Nelson.
I:19503;109;Well written and performed movie.
I:19503;110;Will recommend to others and definitely think this is a must see.
I:19503;111;This movie is very well done.
I:19503;112;The acting is precise, even an expression from Ryan Gosling lets you know how his character is experiencing life, whether it be he is high on drugs or inspiring his students in the inner city classroom.
I:19503;113;Shareeka Epps portrays her character equally good.
I:19503;114;She demonstrates the hardships of her lifestyle, which depicts the lifestyle of so many young people in the very same situation.
I:19503;115;What I appreciate about the way the script was written is that even with her rough around the edges ways, she is still strong and willing to do the right thing under the most extreme circumstances.
I:19503;116;the lighting in the movie is spot.
I:19503;117;on, the story sucks you in and the settings are so believable, you feel compassion for the characters because you feel what they are feeling.
I:19503;118;i recommend watching this movie, even if it is just once.
I:19503;119;Ryan Gosling is up for Actor in a Leading role, and I am afraid to say that his nomination may be his reward.
I:19503;120;The best I've ever seen him, but he's up against DiCaprio and Whitaker (and a few others who won't win.)
I:19503;121;Shareeka Epps, his student, befriends him, and she does a fine job.
I:19503;122;This is her second role, a role she reprised from the short film of the same story line she did two years ago.
I:19503;123;She has a chance to be good, and she shows it in an understated muted role in this film where she attempts to juggle education and drug dealing on the inner city streets.
I:19503;124;Early in the film Gosling tells another character that he's a teacher to touch just one life.
I:19503;125;This one is a gem.
I:19503;126;Ryan Gosling's a great actor who can tackle the quirky and dark stuff .
I:19503;127;"Surely, it will appeal to all those types who revel in uninformed fantasies of ""conquering"" inner."
I:19503;128;Two knockout performances dominate this uncompromising and emotionally visceral indie.
I:19503;129;addicted Brooklyn middle school history teacher, and Drey, a 13.
I:19503;130;Fleck and co. writer Anna Boden establish Dan's gifts as a teacher almost immediately as the character engages his class with natural ease.
I:19503;131;He honestly earns our attention and even our compassion despite the selfishness Dan displays at times.
I:19503;132;She affectingly conveys the self.
I:19503;133;together Gosling and Epps remarkably achieve an unexpected symbiosis that makes Dan's and Drey's ongoing struggles palpable.
I:19503;134;The supporting cast is uniformly strong with effective turns by Anthony Mackie, who shows surprising depth in what could have been a stock villain role as Frank, and by Karen Chilton etching the regret and exhaustion in Drey's mother in just a few brief scenes.
I:19503;135;Half Nelson is the best movie I've seen in the theaters all year.
I:19503;136;Complex and moving, it challenges the viewer to confront easy stereotypes.
I:19503;137;Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance as Dan, a crack.
I:19503;138;The relationship is one of opposing forces, as Dan lectures one day in his class: black and white, teacher and student, adult and child.
I:19503;139;But there is far more ambiguity explored here, which I love to see in films.
I:19503;140;there are so many scenes that the movie gets just right.
I:19503;141;And when Dan goes home for a family dinner, you can see exactly where the addiction was fostered.
I:19503;142;Director Ryan Fleck and co. screenwriter Anna Boden capture these moments with clarity and restraint.
I:19503;143;thank god it was honored by the Independent Spirit Awards and Ryan Gosling won best actor there.
I:19503;144;This is a great movie for early teenagers to teach them the pitfalls of using drugs.
I:19503;145;It's interesting that this was like a film school type project.
I:19503;146;will keep watching this movie again.
I:19503;147;although I certainly love films.
I:19503;148;but I took the trek into NYC to see this film.
I:19503;149;I'm certainly glad I did!
I:19503;150;This is a beautifully crafted film expertly written and directed by Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden.
I:19503;151;The smallness of this film makes it breathtaking.
I:19503;152;I saw it on the big screen somewhere in the Village, and the close.
I:19503;153;If they do, it will be a masterpiece much like HALF NELSON certainly is.
I:19503;154;I saw Half Nelson in the movie theater twice, and just admired it on every level.
I:19503;155;It's a very brave, daring movie.
I:19503;156;You can help but root for the characters in this gritty tale.
I:19503;157;i was so THRILLED when Ryan Gosling received an Oscar nomination for his role.
I:19503;158;The movie belongs to him and he demonstrated why he is one of his generation's most talented actors.
I:19503;159;He teaches in a public (black) school.
I:19503;160;good movies with a white JUDAS.
I:19503;161;HALF NELSON is one of those rare breed of films that takes a unique idea, wraps it in an intelligent script, finds the perfect actors to bring the story to life, and does it all on a minimal budget that goes for the jugular rather than the glitz of promotion.
I:19503;162;He is committed to his ideals but his technique is very student friendly and his class respects his demeanor.
I:19503;163;Very subtly he draws out the significance of important historical events, allowing the students to embrace the essence of civil rights rather than the rhetoric of the usual classroom approach.
I:19503;164;Drey is lonely: her brother is in prison for dealing drugs, her mother is works double time as a security officer to support them, and her brother's friend Frank (Anthony Mackie) coerces Drey into delivering drugs to his clients.
I:19503;165;ryan Fleck directs this film with the most subtle and sensitive technique, allowing us to view the flaws as well as the virtues of his characters.
I:19503;166;The script written by both Fleck and Anna Boden is creative in the classroom communication and minimal in the interplay outside the classroom, allowing the words to be superceded by eye messages and silence that is deafening.
I:19503;167;Gosling and Epps are brilliant in their ability to keep their characters credible, never opting for histrionics, always choosing to underplay potentially volatile scenes.
I:19503;168;The supporting cast is equally fine with the majority of the actors being in their first film and the others are solid professionals from previous quiet films.
I:19503;169;HALF NELSON is a wholly successful accomplishment, a film whose value will grow through repeated viewings and with history of cinema.
I:19503;170;marketable to a mass audience.
I:19503;171;This allows the Actors and Writers more artistic freedom.
I:19503;172;"Reminiscent of 2000's excellent ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Half Nelson"" shows the ravages of drug addiction on a seemingly normal person."
I:19503;173;At the beginning of the film, Ryan Gosling's Dan Dunne seems merely an offbeat, creative inner.
I:19503;174;Mr. Gosling bravely tackles this role with grace and a strange dignity .
I:19503;175;His Oscar nomination is well.
I:19503;176;"deserved: he never takes this role ""over the top"" and manages to be sympathetic and tragic all at once."
I:19503;177;Ms. Epps is excellent as well, displaying a maturity and finesse as Mr. Gosling's ally.
I:19503;178;I have seen similar journeys by people I love and this movie just proved to me what an amazing actor Ryan Gosling is.
I:19503;179;gosling is compelling and troubled teacher's pet Shareeka Epps a remarkable stand.
I:19503;180;driven but these are two masterful performances.
I:19503;181;This is ryan goslings greatest work by far.
I:19503;182;This is an independent movie that is completely character driven.
I:19503;183;Not a feel good movie.
I:19503;184;Ryan Gosling's performance was one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen.
I:19503;185;Teachers are long held up as beacons of hope, inspirational figures that effect and shape our lives.
I:19503;186;"The spate of inspirational teacher films is many
I:19503;187;dan Dunne, junior high school teacher, teaches inspriationally, realistically, with realistic, bright kids.
I:19503;188;The feel of his classroom, one of discourse and lecture, is one that is supprtive, relavent and positive.
I:19503;189;His deft, sad performance is definitely Oscar worthy, and made even better by Shareeka Epps' performance as Drey.
I:19503;190;Together they make a complex pair, teacher and student, humans trying to relate to each other and the awkward circumstances in their lives.
I:19503;191;half Nelson is NOT for people wanting an uplifting story, or a feel.
I:19503;192;, but if you like a great script, human characters and the dynamic complexities of life, Half Nelson would be for you.
I:19503;193;As other reviews have stated the cast is great and the acting is really good.
I:19503;194;i think that ryan gosling is one of my fav actors he can just play anothing and this is such a great movie and not many people know about it
I:19503;195;There are detailed, insightful reviews of Half Nelson in this section.
I:19503;196;this character caused this film to be a life.
I:19503;197;I have known this character in real life, life on the bottom.
I:19503;198;I thought he was a good guy, just as Drey does.
I:19503;199;Because he is a very nice guy.
I:19503;200;"that Frank is one of the most sinister characters I ever read, and his real existence in real people in the real world is equally sinister, and I'd never realized that my own ""friend"" had used women like that,like Frank used Drey and her brother, smiling all the while."
I:19503;201;Half Nelson writen partially and directed by Ryan Fleck is a great film.
I:19503;202;i really enjoyed this film alot the classroom scenes were great especialy the civil rights scenes.
I:19503;203;The whole story line is a good one because it is so real with the drug use and how it tears relationships apart and how people like goslins character come to terms and wake up to there addictions and get clean.
I:19503;204;I am not just saying that I enjoyed the movie just because Ryan Fleck is my Cousin I enjoyed it because it is trully great film making.
I:19503;205;In addition, I thought that it was going to be a documentary.
I:19503;206;Shareeka Epps, who plays Dre, is definitely promising, but not in Gosling's league.
I:19503;207;Dan Dunne is a gifted history teacher in an inner city school.
I:19503;208;His star pupil, Drey (Shareeka Epps) learns of his secret life and struggles as that life intersects her own.
I:19503;209;this is a fascinating story whose story arcs are anything but neat and clean.
I:19503;210;Drey is appalled at the effect of drugs on her family, but drawn toward its aura of success and belonging.
I:19503;211;written, believable, and genuinely affecting film that touches on the intersection of hope and frailty, seasoned with issues of race and class.
I:19503;212;Another great turn by Ryan Gosling as Dunne.
I:19503;213;As always, Gosling gives a superb performance.
I:19503;214;Truly one of the best actors of his generation.
I:19503;215;"If there ever was a movie that should be seen for an astonishing performance by an actor, it's ""Half Nelson"" with Ryan Gosling."
I:19503;216;"The Canadian born Gosling, who co. starred in ""The Notebook"" with Rachel McAdams and made his debut on ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" plays Dan Dunne, a history teacher in a Brooklyn junior high school."
I:19503;217;Nominated for an Academy Award, Gosling brings incredible depth to the role of the troubled teacher with a cocaine problem.
I:19503;218;Despite the double life, he is a good teacher who really does inspire his students.
I:19503;219;Watching Dunne make such enormous effort to put on a good face for his students is heart.
I:19503;220;the story starts moving in a new direction when 13.
I:19503;221;enhanced sexual encounter with another teacher.
I:19503;222;Neither character is assigned the role as the main catalyst for the change brewing in their lives, but the simple friendship between teacher and student brings healing and transformation.
I:19503;223;Gosling is terrific as the idealistic young educator who has a confident, easygoing manner in the classroom, but whose addiction problem is beginning to affect his job performance, and most tragically, his friendship with Drey, played with a mix of sheepish charm and street.
I:19503;224;"Smart and stridently unsentimental, ""Half."
I:19503;225;"nelson"" will get its grip on you."
I:19503;226;Dan Dunne takes drugs often, they are running his life, and he also teaches history.
I:19503;227;He is dealing with students that live with less than perfect circumstances, and he is an inspiration to them, this I can tell is what I am supposed to believe.
I:19503;228;He has hangovers, and trouble focusing often in class, and I just find him boring during the scenes that are examples of how he is meaningful to these students.
I:19503;229;One student, Drey, makes an impression on him.
I:19503;230;He appreciates her, because she appreciates him, and because she has a spirit that one can hope will carry her past her present life situation to one where her intelligence will benefit her in good ways.
I:19503;231;Yes, the actress that plays Drey is very talented.
I:19503;232;Ryan Gosling gave a wonderful performance.
I:19503;233;He is one of my favorate actors now (along with Denzel Washington).
I:19503;234;Not sure I liked the ending though.
I:19503;235;I loved it while it was on, but a month later I find myself dismissing much of what I felt at the time.
I:19503;236;"After a month away, I now say, yes, Ryan Gosling was great, and so was the young woman who p
I:19503;237;I do agree that Ryan should have won the Oscar.
I:19503;238;The ending scene was pretty outrageous in this regard, setting them up as a couple with a future filled with possibility.
I:19503;239;It was the traditional happy ending.
I:19503;240;The acting is good, even Tina Holmes, that maneater, is good.
I:19503;241;The most underappreciated performance in my eyes goes to the pair of jockey shorts Ryan Gosling in the film's staggering opening sequence where we see Ryan, still drugged up from the night before, sprawled on the floor of his shabby apartment.
I:19503;242;Inner city teacher uses creative methods to engage his students on issues of history and social change, all the while nursing a hefty drug habit.
I:19503;243;In the process, he strikes up a friendship with Drey, a young black girl who is one of his students.
I:19503;244;"She carries with her the ""secret"" of his drug use."
I:19503;245;Half Nelson is a gritty movie, bordering at times on a documentary.
I:19503;246;Ryan Gosling gives a superb performance of the drugged out teacher.
I:19503;247;tidy resolutions elude the movie in this slightly depressing but powerful tale.
I:19503;248;Ryan Gosling is, without question, one of the finest actors of his generation.
I:19503;249;And I admire that he is still choosing to work in independent, meaningful films.
I:19503;250;He's come a long way from his days as a Mouseketeer.
I:19503;251;Shareeka Epps stars as Drey in a very straightforward, natural performance.
I:19503;252;She is growing up with the fear that she will become like her brother.
I:19503;253;There is almost a feeling of inevitability, this is her world and she is incapable of escaping it.
I:19503;254;Gosling's Dan, on the other hand, is a semi.
I:19503;255;There is a helplessness to his life as well.
I:19503;256;And where she can't change her own circumstances, she makes a connection with Dan.
I:19503;257;it's an interesting dynamic, one that isn't often portrayed.
I:19503;258;It's just two characters quietly drawn to each other and gaining strength, however fleetingly, from that association.
I:19503;259;You may have a glimmer of hope, but realistically you know it's going to be an uphill battle.
I:19503;260;Ryan Gosling plays Dan Dunn, a history teacher and basketball coach who attempts to think outside the box when teaching his students about the civil rights movement.
I:19503;261;Dan lives a pretty solitary life, alone with his cat and his addiction.
I:19503;262;Hypocrisy is ripe with this film.
I:19503;263;The friendship that blooms between Dan and Drey is at the heart of the film, and its development is what makes the film worth watching.
I:19503;264;Ryan Gossling's portrayal of a caring but conflicted/addicted teacher was the best acting showcase I have seen in years.
I:19503;265;"While Forrest Whitaker was great in ""The Last King Of Scotland,"" he should have won for supporting actor."
I:19503;266;Ryan actually made me believe that he was a crack addict who cared he was so good in this flick and should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.
I:19503;267;Overall, a devastating movie with some of the best acting you will see in this year or any other.
I:19503;268;This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:19503;269;The first 1 or 2 minutes of the movie is just great!
I:19503;270;At the end I was surprised, and pleasantly so, to find what I thought was the point.
I:19503;271;Dan is a teacher and Drey is his student, but most of what is significant about their lives and their relationship clearly happens outside of the classroom.
I:19503;272;It also brings things to a head and what I really like about this movie is that it resolves both the conflict between Dan and Frank, as well as the relationship between Dan and Drey, in ways that I did not anticipate.
I:19503;273;This is a movie that I think you will enjoy more the second time around when you can stop being distracted by what the film is not about to enjoy how it does set up its true thesis.
I:19503;274;We see the young teacher Dan Dunne who is handsome and a dedicated teacher in a poor school.
I:19503;275;Ryan Gosling was nominated for Best Actor for the film and won the honor for his Breakthrough Performance from the National Board of Review.
I:19503;276;She won Best Supporting Actress awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Society.
I:19503;277;It is a sensitive portrayal.
I:19503;278;Tina Holmes plays Rachel in the film and finds it hard to be with Dan.
I:19503;279;We see Dan's family, Drey's family, and many of the students in the school.
I:19503;280;I thought the film ended on a positive note as Dunne shaves his scraggly beard.
I:19503;281;Perhaps he has hit bottom and will start to pull himself together.
I:19503;282;It speaks to the frailty and magnificence that lie side by side in each of us.
I:19503;283;This is the concept Fleck wanted to convey in this film, and he's done that, for sure.
I:19503;284;as schoolteacher Dan Dunne, Ryan Gosling is superb, playing a young man who simultaneously challenges his inner city history students with concepts no other teacher would even dare think of (Hegel's dialectics), yet at the same time addicted to freebase crack cocaine.
I:19503;285;When one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers his addiction, an unusual relationship develops between the two, made all the more powerful by the fact that Drey is not your usual inner city student, but really smart.
I:19503;286;While Gosling is indeed extremely good in his role, newcomer Shareeka Epps is brilliant, just as strong if not stronger than Gosling in screen presence, and carrying way more than her share of the responsibility for this being a four.
I:19503;287;the third wheel is Anthony Mackie who plays a friendly drug dealer in the movie's setting, south central Los Angeles, and while he's also very good, it's really Epps and Gosling who drive Half Nelson.
I:19503;288;Mackie's character helps out Drey because Drey's brother is in jail and is a good friend of the drug dealer.
I:19503;289;The irony, of course, is that Dunne himself is a convergence of strength and weakness.
I:19503;290;great teacher and also drug addict.
I:19503;291;And, as we see, Drey herself embodies this convergence as well, although not to the same extent that Dan does.
I:19503;292;She's a tough kid, but also recognizes the good in people.
I:19503;293;She knows Dan is good, but at the same time sees his weakness.
I:19503;294;this is a superior film, a riveting character study in which the two leads know exactly who their characters are.
I:19503;295;Loved the message and passion involved in this tale.
I:19503;296;Here, Gosling is absolutely remarkable in his performance as a powder then crack cocaine user who is also a brilliant teacher.
I:19503;297;Let me tell you it is his style of teaching that gets through to them.
I:19503;298;Lord, you who are teachers like I am know how brilliantly true this is!
I:19503;299;Dunn is a creative, committed teacher who finds remarkable ways to reach his students.
I:19503;300;Gosling's expression is priceless (btw, he is one heck of an actor).
I:19503;301;the backdrop of his family life explains a lot, as does Dre's.
I:19503;302;Dre has just persuaded Dunn to clean up his room and his personal hygiene.
I:19503;303;Then sitting down on opposite ends of the sofa, they smile shyly at one another, acknowledging their bond.
I:19503;304;This is a terrific movie, another indie classic.
I:19503;305;I am new to this operation of watching on a smart TV and I thought this was a Prime movie.
I:19503;306;Half Nelson delivers another stunning performance by Gosling, but the film as a whole doesn't quite live up to Gosling's abilities.
I:19503;307;The performances of Shareeka Epps and Gosling were so extraordinary though, they kept me from giving up on this film.
I:19503;308;the plot of a brilliant, white teacher who teaches at a predominately black inner.
I:19503;309;I was pleasantly surprised to discover a richer movie than that, and by the end of the film, I had to applaud the film for not trying to wrap the film up with some overall moral or teaching.
I:19503;310;I highly recommend this movie because it has seamless acting, a compelling story, and a wonderful soundtrack.
I:19503;311;"For several years now I have been waiting for Ryan Gosling to fulfill the promise that he exhibited in his revolutionary performance in ""The Believer."""
I:19503;312;"Films have come and gone and in most of them he has been giving good performances (""Murder by Numbers"") and problematic ones (""The Notebook"") but always with a sense of who he is as an actor and more importantly how he can use his talent and his very being to bring the story of the character he is playing alive."
I:19503;313;now with his Dan Dunne, Gosling has finally fulfilled that promise and his Dunne is complicated (a terrific, human, enabling and encouraging high school teacher who is also a cocaine free.
I:19503;314;He is upright, strong, smart, loving but can't help but call on the appeal of drugs to douse the raging fire of indecision and self.
I:19503;315;fleck and Boden give us expositional information in a very interesting way here particularly the juxtaposition, the flipping back and forth of the images between the Dunne family dinner (ex.
I:19503;316;But honestly: which family situation is best, which family situation is the most comforting for Dan and Drey.
I:19503;317;besides Gosling, there are a couple of actresses here that deserve special note.
I:19503;318;She actually steals her very first scene with Gosling by under acting and the sheer luminosity of her performance.
I:19503;319;secondly, Shareeka Epps as Drey is amazing: she has an old soul, and like Holmes a gravity and a basic honesty that sets her apart from others in her family and the other students in this film.
I:19503;320;A work which tells to the Americans much more than to others.
I:19503;321;a teacher, as understood, has lost a job at the end.
I:19503;322;life screenplay by Fleck and editor/producer Anna Boden presents Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), a history teacher in an inner.
I:19503;323;The story plays out in ways that are fresh and surprising, yet always completely logical given the characters, and the end, though not the gift.
I:19503;324;wrapped resolution American audiences expect, offers a fragile ray of hope for both Dunne and Drey.
I:19503;325;A large part of the film's impact comes from the performances of the ensemble cast,which could not possibly be more natural, real, or compelling.
I:19503;326;Gosling, in particular, nails the contradictions of his character's personality, making the dichotomy between his idealism and his moral turpitude all too believable.
I:19503;327;style camera adds to the you.
I:19503;328;The connection between Dunne and Drey is unique and innocent.
I:19503;329;But the best part is when you discover, you are getting as much, if not more out of the relationship as you put in to it.
I:19503;330;Understanding, compassion and empathy are both free to give and priceless to receive.
I:19503;331;wonderful perfomances by Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie.
I:19503;332;I look forward to the opportunity to see them in more films in the future and highly recommend Half Nelson to others.
I:19503;333;He's a very good actor and I like his film choices, but I must give credit to Shareeka Epps who's acting chops amazed me.
I:19503;334;I was mesmerized by her character and her subtle expression which made her seem very old and wise beyond her years.
I:19503;335;I was completely engrossed in this film and it's characters.
I:19503;336;This is a very strong film, that features some remarkable performances by Ryan Gosling and newcomer Shareeka Epps.
I:19503;337;The dialogue is excellent, the film looks good (nothing fantastic, but very competently directed, in such a way as to not draw attention away from the characters or the story, which is really the point here), the music is strong and supports the emotions that come out of the story, without forcing them upon you.
I:19503;338;You really can't ask for more, this film is another indication that in spite of the attention given to first weekend grosses of big blockbusters, the heart of American cinema remains in the small independent films that address real issues faced by real people.
I:19503;339;This was hands down my favorite film of 2006.
I:19503;340;"ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps are nothing short of brilliant, with the former absolutely deserved of his nomination for his performance, and the latter unforgivably robbed of ""best supporting"" recognition at this year's Oscars."
I:19503;341;destructive spiral into drugs, but an unexpectedly quiet, personal, and nonviolent meditation on being able to wake up to another day, on being able to give yourself over to others who know better than to judge, on being able to help simply in the form of friendship.
I:19503;342;But I'm just perfectly fine with being able to turn this on whenever I want to!
I:19503;343;So that is why I saw it and that comes with the expectation that the movie will be bad but the performance will be good.
I:19503;344;As the movie progressed, the movie did a great job adding depth to Gosling though the plot went in a strange direction.
I:19503;345;the adult language intensifies towards the end of the film, but the real reason to be wary of Half Nelson is the vivid drug.
I:19503;346;Mr. Dunne's extracuricular chemical dependency is very important to his character and the movie and the creators did not shy away from it.
I:19503;347;friendly movie and while even I was uncomfortable a few times, I really liked it.
I:19503;348;This performance and obviously the nomination should really give him the opportunity to establish himself as one of the best young talents in the business.
I:19503;349;Ryan Gosling was deserving of his nomination, and you may become familiar with the name Shareeka Epps after her performance as well.
I:19503;350;It had some impressive artistic merit and many good things to take away from it.
I:19503;351;Well, I must say that Ryan Gosling definitely deserved his Oscar nomination for this film.
I:19503;352;I am surprised that Epps did not get an Oscar nomination as well for her poignant portrayal.
I:19503;353;Still, both characters, teacher and student, help each other out through their rough times.
I:19503;354;Overall, this was a touching and realistic look at inner city school life.
I:19503;355;Gosling goofs around on screen with Epps and other actors.
I:19503;356;For some reason, Gosling loves to gesture at the camera.
I:19503;357;It still brings a smile when I recall those charming little stories/jokes that lighten up those serious/difficult moments.

I:19503;359;"written review here on amazon by ron ""true faith"" who also gives the film three stars."
I:19503;360;His review completely nails it as far as Half Nelson goes.
I:19503;361;Half Nelson tells a story of the power of friendship.
I:19503;362;"Drey catches Dan using at a school function, thus begins a friendship of need or enabling considering Drey is ""in training"" to deliver drugs to help the family income."
I:19503;363;"The power to live should be the greatest drug around, over a ""dirt nap"", and that is what he was ultimately looking for with drugs."
I:19503;364;Dan said he wanted to reach his kids and help them to want more, well he did just that with a previous student and when it was brought to his attention, he could not remember the student.
I:19503;365;I like Mr. Gosling, but this was clearly an independent film.
I:19503;366;He's matched every step of the way by young Shareeka Epps.
I:19503;367;"It makes me question the criteria of Oscar voters
I:19503;368;Some fine messages to be learned by all.

I:19503;373;The movie clearly has magnificent acting, and an interesting story line.

I:19503;379;These kids are coming from broken homes with family members in jail and drugs right around the corner.
I:19503;380;I did like how the film tried to portray Don as a good person with a good heart who just happened to be weak by being addicted to drugs.
I:19503;381;That was one of the strengths in the film: Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Don.

I:19503;387;Urging them to linger over history and consider it, not merely read and regurgitate, he provides an encouraging presence for the kids not just in the classroom but as a coach on the basketball court.
I:19503;388;he has a life full of important obligations, but his vices and dour circumstances .
I:19503;389;keep steering him away from the right path.
I:19503;390;She is able to empathize with his unenviable situation, however, and grows particularly close to Dunn .
I:19503;391;the lives of Dunn and Drey soon overlap due to their intense, deep care for one another.
I:19503;392;A lot of films have promise, but this fulfills every one of them with magic to spare.
I:19503;393;That is saying something, my friends.
I:19503;394;I agree with Amazon's review in that Ryan Gosling's Oscar.
I:19503;395;nominated performance finally has him living up to all the hype that has surrounded this talented actor who has chosen some questionable film roles.
I:19503;396;watching a overall decent and caring teacher free.
I:19503;397;It's scary and wholly believable.
I:19503;398;"i recommend this film based on its realism, uncompromising plot, and acting power
I:19503;399;opening, insightful, heartbreaking and hopeful all at once.
I:19503;400;Ryan is outstanding in the lead, andShareka sure holds her own.
I:19503;401;"I found Half Nelson to be captivating in relationships,The teacher, pupil relationship
I:19503;402;By the way the motherrole played by Karen Chilton was excellent.
I:19503;403;He does an excellent job as teacher Dan Dunne who is brilliant but he is addicted to drugs.
I:19503;404;He is dedicated to teaching the material in ways to get his students to learn and it works.
I:19503;405;He befriends one of his students who is also friends with the local drug dealer.
I:19503;406;The acting in this movie is good, Anthony Mackie does a good job as Frank the drug dealer.
I:19503;407;"An independent film starring Ryan Gosling (""The Notebook"", ""Murder By Numbers""), released by a very small independent company, it will be difficult for most to find this film, but it is well worth the effort to search for it."
I:19503;408;"This is the best thing about `Ebert and Roeper'
I:19503;409;"Will they be able to help each other escape the life they are destined for?Written by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden and directed by Fleck, ""Half Nelson"" is a remarkably believable film."
I:19503;410;"The performances by Gosling and Epps are the key to the success of ""Half Nelson"", but the story, direction, everything else about the film is as memorable and believable."
I:19503;411;As Dunne, he subtly reveals things about his character throughout, each time, providing a new link to the overall portrait, a new piece of the puzzle.
I:19503;412;We learn early on that Dunne is a drug addict, but what is surprising is that he is still able to function in his job, and rather well, as a history teacher.
I:19503;413;Then, we watch as he courts another teacher, and this helps us to learn how he deals with his relationships, and it makes sense when he seems to blow off an old friend.
I:19503;414;This may seem theatrical, but it works because both performers are entirely natural.
I:19503;415;Another thing that helps both of these performances is their subtlety.
I:19503;416;Each is reveled in layers, as the film progresses, allowing us to assimilate the information and make the characters seem real.
I:19503;417;Look at the great performance by Gosling!
I:19503;418;But because the film is independent, the filmmakers don't have to hit emotional cues at certain prescribed times, they can let the characters unfold more naturally, aiding the performances and making them real.
I:19503;419;shareeka Epps is also quite good as Drey, the young girl who is a student of Dunne's.
I:19503;420;As the story is about their relationship, we spend a significant amount of time with her.
I:19503;421;The character is 12, going on 40, and Epps manages to portray her strong.
I:19503;422;But because she has no one in her life, she starts to look at Dunne and Frank for support, friendship, companionship, and a male influence.
I:19503;423;As the relationship with both men grows, a tug of war develops between them.
I:19503;424;An inner city girl living in a home with her single mom, left to her own devices.
I:19503;425;The filmmakers have created a believable, interesting portrait of these two main characters and all of their influences and problems.
I:19503;426;The key to the film is that everything is revealed in stages, slowly, allowing us to assimilate before learning something new.
I:19503;427;Everything is a piece of the puzzle and we learn of certain pieces at certain times.
I:19503;428;Gosling deserves a lot of credit for making this work.
I:19503;429;Yet, he still manages to function.
I:19503;430;But will they be able to help each other?
I:19503;431;"This helps to maintain the realism of the story and their problems
I:19503;432;Half Nelson is a film that will be difficult to find, but it deserves the effort and your attention.
I:19503;433;Help this film reach a large audience.
I:19503;434;Ryan Gosling accurately and excellently portrayed a drug addicted teacher, resisted help from many sources and never seemed to realize help was being offered.
I:19503;435;hearing adults to enjoy the experience.
I:19503;436;Half Nelson is first and foremost an UNFORGETTABLE PERFORMANCE by Ryan Gosling, just perfect as a young teacher who discovers so many things about himself when he gets close to one of his student (impressive Shareeka Epps).
I:19503;437;It's beautiful because it's a very simple story: the meeting of two people that will change their life.
I:19503;438;Ryan Gosling definitely deserves the recognition that he has gotten for this role.
I:19503;439;He is such a promising young actor and the directors have done a great job in creating an environment in which he explores the character.
I:19503;440;Shareeka Epps is also a good new find .
I:19503;441;it will be exciting to see what she does next.
I:19503;442;Movie buffs and actors alike should definitley check this one out .
I:19503;443;one of the best simple indie films in awhile.
I:19503;444;The ending is also refreshing as it gives the audience just enough information to infer the outcome of these characters without spelling anything out.
I:19503;445;racial friendship, and spiritual redemption/recovery.
I:19503;446;It's a very strong movie and captivating in it's own way, because it focuses on character and performances more than plotline.
I:19503;447;At times, it's feels kind of documentary.
I:19503;448;The performances by Gosling and Epps were so real and memsmerizing.
I:19503;449;Gosling is very convincing with his overall portrayal of a school teacher trying to hide his addiction while struggling to quit at the same time.
I:19503;450;I think it's certainly a good movie in a way that it's very educational and inspirational to the audiences who have been in those two characters' shoes.
I:19503;451;So yes, it was entirely convincing that Gosling's performance in this film was worthy of his Oscar nomination, and IMO he's the best Canadian actor of his generation!
I:19503;452;Half Nelson is a 2006 independent film starring Ryan Gosling as Mr. Dunne, a white school teacher in an inner.
I:19503;453;He strikes up a much.
I:19503;454;needed friendship with one of his students, a latchkey 13 year.
I:19503;455;"Yet, even this doesn't explain why the film fails to be truly good or great
I:19503;456;"By hypocritical"" I mean the obvious: How much of a positive impact could he possibly have on inner."
I:19503;457;lot of good that confrontation did.
I:19503;458;"The camera bobbles around too much as if to draw attention to itself (""See, this is a realistic slice."
I:19503;459;We also come to care about Drey .
I:19503;460;It's a fine point but it could have been done in a much more compelling way.
I:19503;461;I did appreciate quite a few aspects of it, especially Dunne's unlikely friendship with a 13 year.
I:19503;462;First of all, Half Nelson is everything an independent film should be.
I:19503;463;What Half Nelson offers is a cinematic slice of realistic life.
I:19503;464;The realistic life the script is most concerned with is Dan Dunne, a junior high teacher in Brooklyn with a little bit of a drug problem.
I:19503;465;ryan Gosling excellently portrays the troubled teacher and earns his Oscar nomination without a doubt.
I:19503;466;Dan Dunne wants to change the world.
I:19503;467;He wants to help people.
I:19503;468;Epps brings enough to her character to carry her scenes and even keep up with Gosling in all their scenes together.
I:19503;469;(She earned a Best Young Actress nomination but Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine won).
I:19503;470;ultimately, Dunne understands that he can't help everyone in the world, but he can help one person, namely Drey.
I:19503;471;"What keeps the movie from being another ""Dangerous Minds""."
I:19503;472;the realism in the construction of this script and filmwork is what really sets this film apart, and Ryan Gosling's acting just seals the deal.
I:19503;473;If you want to see a best actor nominee from this year that is really in a good movie, check out Half Nelson.
