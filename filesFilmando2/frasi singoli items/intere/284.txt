I:8424;1;and is intrigued by it, so I will tread lightly.
I:8424;2;or one of the most incredible lapses of continuity scoping, and then the pun splats you in the face!
I:8424;3;when David comes to the gallery and meets Elijah's mother, they talk and are getting acquainted and she is telling some things about Elijah.
I:8424;4;she says: He has come through a lot in his life.
I:8424;5;and a few likes are sufficient, I think.
I:8424;6;Superman always had the aesthetic and power appeal for me.
I:8424;7;and that neat lightning bolt on his chest.
I:8424;8;what a way to kill a fantasy!The best photography in this film is the first outside shot of the Limited Edition gallery.
I:8424;9;the painting behind David and his wife in the restaurant has unbelievably beautiful color.
I:8424;10;the person I mentioned who likes this film is especially impressed with the scene in the train station when David walks down the stairs to be where there are people (as Elijah has told him to do).
I:8424;11;the most contrasting music versus action comes when David struggles with the killer in the bedroom.you have this very interesting heroic/almost religious music while these two guys are grappling in a very real looking bedroom.
I:8424;12;the best sound in the film is when David first walks into the bedroom.
I:8424;13;nice effect of sound and visual.
I:8424;14;let's hope two and three are better and more able to stand alone on their own.
I:8424;15;does this film measure up in your mind to a possible rival for the first entry in the Godfather trilogy?
I:8424;16;In fact, it is quite good.
I:8424;17;And the acting and direction are competent.
I:8424;18;nevertheless, in the Twilight Zone/O Henry/Guy DeMaupassant tradition, it works marvelously.
I:8424;19;There is a cerebral payoff.
I:8424;20;action summer blockbluster mentalitly not only sounded wonderful, but something close to god.
I:8424;21;Not only does Mr. Shyamalan propose that comic books are modern day mythology, he also attempts to prove their true art in this very well made film.
I:8424;22;What Mr. Shyamalan does is essentially take comic bnooks into the real world, stripping the story of the campy and silly plot lines which we have all associated with superheroes.
I:8424;23;He's a common man, with a breaking marriage and father and son relationship that would make Bill Cosby's head spin.
I:8424;24;Elijah, Sam Jackson's character is also very much down to earth and brings to the screen a certain air that makes you WANT to believe this could happen.
I:8424;25;The somber tone of the film also adds to the natural feeling of the story, showing how a normal man would naturally deal with the prospect that he is not only more that meets the eye, but something god.
I:8424;26;like, born solely to fight the evil in the world.
I:8424;27;These things add up to create a film of that takes fantasy and make it seem as close to reality as possible.
I:8424;28;Though the topic of unfaithfullness is addressed you can tell that there is something truly devistating between his life, and his wife's (Robin Wright Penn).
I:8424;29;The once avid spark of love has fragmented and broken, and for this reason, he takes a train ride to get a new job in New York.
I:8424;30;If the job turns out, he is leaving his wife and son.
I:8424;31;It is on this train that something tragic, and wonderful happens.
I:8424;32;He survives without a scratch.
I:8424;33;Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book dealer that is full of dark secrets, and knows after reading about Willis's survival in the train crash, that perhaps a life long search is over.
I:8424;34;I recommend this movie for sixth sense fans, and to those of you who love a good surprise ending.
I:8424;35;That to me is the first and foremost way to rate a movie.
I:8424;36;Unbreakable taunts your brain and raises a lot of questions, and is entirely believable.
I:8424;37;Best thing about this movie was the trailer.
I:8424;38;half way through i was still eager to watch.
I:8424;39;I think M. Night Shyamalan has proven that he is one of the most talented new directors today.
I:8424;40;The Sixth Sense is truly awesome, and Signs is his masterpiece.
I:8424;41;It's just a testimony to how good Signs and Sixth Sense are.
I:8424;42;Unbreakable is a great film itself.
I:8424;43;Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give great performances.
I:8424;44;As always the visuals (especially color) play a huge role in the telling of the story.
I:8424;45;And there is Night's twists at the end.
I:8424;46;It's really a well done movie, and like his other movies, one that has to be watched many times to get it all.
I:8424;47;What it does have is a behind the scenes featurette that is very well done (not like all those we've seen that are basically 20 minute summary/trailer).
I:8424;48;There's also a featurette that discusses comic books and superheros.
I:8424;49;what makes this film especially interesting is that instead of making a movie about a superhero, like most filmmakers would do, Night makes the movie about a man discovering he is a superhero.
I:8424;50;M. Night Shyamalan will one day take his place amongst the great directors like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Orson Welles.
I:8424;51;rays and he was very happy with this blu.
I:8424;52;M. Night Shayamalan made another great hit.
I:8424;53;This movie has a really good story and a shocking ending that some people don't get until the movie actually finishes but it is easy to get.
I:8424;54;This movie also has one of the most, if not the most emotional soundtrack ever made.
I:8424;55;The soundtrack is hard to get so if you see it I suggest you get it right away.
I:8424;56;David not only survives the train crash, but he walks away with not a single scratch on him.
I:8424;57;Unbreakable is a dark, eerie movie that takes you through the birth, so to speak, of a hero.
I:8424;58;this is a very good movie to add to your collection.
I:8424;59;I have seen it multiple times now, and each time I find something new to appreciate.
I:8424;60;Unbreakable benefits from strong acting, a tight script, and excellent directing.
I:8424;61;It's a quiet and cerebral film that thoughtfully explores an important dimension of modern American mythology.
I:8424;62;The scale of the action and drama is small and personal.
I:8424;63;For me, however, this aspect of the film made it even more captivating, entertaining and thought.
I:8424;64;As an avid and dedicated comic book fan, this is a dream come true.
I:8424;65;The perfect origin story of a superhero and his nemesis (how should there be a hero without a villain?)
I:8424;66;At the same time Mr. Shyamalan uses the camera so perfectly and in particular slow moments so well as only masters of storytelling in comic books do through the use of white spaces.
I:8424;67;The deleted scenes are the 'usual' good stuff, but the special on the power of comics is just wonderful.
I:8424;68;Legends such as Frank Miller, Dave Gibbons and Will Eisner as well as Scott McLoud, from 'Understanding Comics' fame are interviewed AND also recent Pulitzer price winner Michael Chabon is included!
I:8424;69;Unbreakable is a very underrated film.
I:8424;70;off and getting there are a lot fun.
I:8424;71;This whole movie was like the introduction to a bigger and better movie.
I:8424;72;It is the origin story of a superhero with lots and lots of class.
I:8424;73;This is a very clever, well written thriller with one of Willis' best performances to date.
I:8424;74;The pace of the movie is slow, methodical and deliberate, which might bore some audiences, but I found it to be incredible.
I:8424;75;There is a twist at the end for those who were a fan the Sixth Sense, but this movie is more than an ending, it is a brilliantly crafted character story, handled with maturity and grace, a far step from any comic book movie ever released.
I:8424;76;Two thumbs up for the movie.
I:8424;77;It is amazing how people would rather watch explosions and Michael Bay, The Marketing Dept's #1 Guy, and take his films somewhat seriously then a film that concentrates on a story first.
I:8424;78;Intelligent and mature college professors dedicate their entire careers to the study of this genre which has been taught and retold over the centuries and taught daily to a serious and intelligent student body.
I:8424;79;This film is a classic study in the fine Joseph Campbell fashion of the hero mythology.
I:8424;80;Which according to his works is a curious and common story that is consistently being retold in various forms across all cultures over the centuries.
I:8424;81;Their are a lot of twists and turns inside of this movie.
I:8424;82;This movie had me wondering what was going on until the final moment of the movie I was able to put the plot together like a nice piece to a puzzle.
I:8424;83;I think Samuel L. Jackson also did a great job in this film.
I:8424;84;I highly recommend this film for movie fans who like a nice plot that will keep you at the edge of your seat!
I:8424;85;Everything is this movie is quiet.
I:8424;86;There is great potential in the story, and maybe with another director chosen to heighten the suspense and character relationships, this could have been a great movie.
I:8424;87;up to The Sixth Sense , it proves to be very dissapointing.
I:8424;88;I did'nt necessarily enjoy this movie.
I:8424;89;Has behind the scenes, the train station sequence: Multi.
I:8424;90;angle feature, and 2 collectible Alex Ross Illustrations.
I:8424;91;At the same time a family works through real issues and eventually rediscovers the glue that bonds them.
I:8424;92;the old Twilight Zone series provided many a great tale with none of the above, and this is what Unbreakable accomplishes.
I:8424;93;This journey of self discovery is prodded along by the character of Samuel Jackson.
I:8424;94;Jackson is masterful is his characterization of a handicapped man and his view point and rational of people.
I:8424;95;He contends that there are actual 'super.
I:8424;96;But then things start to happen, subtle at first, they soon begin to paint a picture that Bruce knows is true but can't believe it.
I:8424;97;Two hours moves you to these last five minutes, and it is worth it.
I:8424;98;First off let me say the packaging is very nice.
I:8424;99;Inside is a Alex Ross collectible card that represent Bruce Willis on one side and Samuel Jackson (both in costume) on the other.
I:8424;100;Very nice, but I would have liked two separate cards instead of one image on each side.
I:8424;101;very interesting to the casual person, but priceless for the comic book fan (a lot of industry names in this feature), a small 5 minute fight scene staring the director as a young teenager (pretty silly overall and wonder why it's here), and a split angle train sequence live action/storyboard (okay).
I:8424;102;It's a wonderful origin story.
I:8424;103;Perhaps it's best that we just have this first piece of the proposed trilogy.
I:8424;104;Some may think it a little slow, but I think the detail is what makes the movie special.
I:8424;105;if you are really a fan of comic book superheroes, or just like a well told story then this will work for you.
I:8424;106;It's about discovery and that takes time.
I:8424;107;It's a good journey to go along for.
I:8424;108;This movie is not for everyone but if you fall on the side that likes it you will most likely love it.
I:8424;109;This movie captures that aspect of the superhero character better than any other film like it.
I:8424;110;It captures what was and is best about superhero comics and how they are, in many ways, just like us ( I believe comic book heros walk the earth ).
I:8424;111;i commend the director and producers of this film for making an outstanding movie even though they most likely realized it was not for everyone.
I:8424;112;Another great job with a terrific film.
I:8424;113;The scenes don't really fit together real well.
I:8424;114;but there is also some good in this movie.
I:8424;115;Most comic books still embody a very hyped vision of the world, which overwhelms most underlying context their stories try to embody.
I:8424;116;What do you do when you realize that you have the power to right wrongs in the world?
I:8424;117;Every scene in this movie evoked the sensation of reading a moving comic book.
I:8424;118;Open most comic books (two examples: Watchmen, AstroCity), and you'll see scenes very similar in look and feel to those in this movie.
I:8424;119;Unbreakable is a movie that has undeniably seemed to accomplish this task.
I:8424;120;With its amazing camera angles and compelling music, Unbreakable keeps the viewers of all ages and interests engrossed over its entire 107 minute span.
I:8424;121;"Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan
I:8424;122;With an illustrious cast composed of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson this movie not only entertains its audience, it also compels them to question the validity of the idea that comic books are true stories that have just been exaggerated.
I:8424;123;"Jackson himself depicts the movie best when he is describing a comic book drawing to a customer stating, ""It is a classic depiction of good versus evil."
I:8424;124;The enormity of his good fortune is hammered home when he attends the memorial service held for the other passengers on the train.
I:8424;125;The viewers see the power of his physical strength when Dunn realizes that he can bench press over 350 pounds, literally without breaking a sweat and they see the power of his mental strength when Dunn confesses that he has the ability to `see' things after touching a person, an idea that is strangely similar to one that is portrayed in The Green Mile starring Tom Hanks.
I:8424;126;While not an original concept, it is one that allows the movie to move forward to the actual comic book scenario in which Dunn finally embraces Price's idea that he is somehow impenetrable to the dangers of the real world.
I:8424;127;He then sets about saving the family, all the while cloaked in a dark poncho that is aptly stamped with the word `Security'.
I:8424;128;Seeing Dunn against the raining night sky, shrouded in black, the viewer gets an image of a true comic book hero come to life.
I:8424;129;While Dunn is in the pool, he flashes back to this childhood incident which provides the audience with a tremendous amount of apprehension that is so commonly found in M. Night Shyamalan's work.
I:8424;130;Despite this lack of closure, Unbreakable secured many positive reviews from all over the world, ensuring is survival in the movie industry.
I:8424;131;Shyamalan does an amazing job convincing his audience that stories really do come true, even if those stories happen to come out of a comic book.
I:8424;132;With its incredible cast, Unbreakable is an excellent modern day version of the story of good versus evil.
I:8424;133;Bruce Willis does his best acting work yet, as an emotionally beaten down guy trying to come to terms with the fact that he may be a superhero.
I:8424;134;Spencer Treat Clark is touching, as a son who idolizes and believes in his father.
I:8424;135;The cinematography is dark and crisp, the story compelling and involving, and the movie has a great surprise ending.
I:8424;136;Those people who liked the movies Vertigo and Basic Instinct will like this one too.
I:8424;137;`Unbreakable' is one of those films that has aged rather well with me.
I:8424;138;One day I'll bombard you with a verbal slaughtering of `Lady in the Water', `Signs' and `The Village' (I refuse to see `The Happening'), but until then you can relish in some praise for `Unbreakable'.
I:8424;139;I appreciate the film much more now than I did when I first saw it (kind of like `The Village', although I still think that `The Village' is a mediocre film).
I:8424;140;one thing that I really admire about this film is Shyamalan's direction.
I:8424;141;He knows how to capture a mood and tone.
I:8424;142;Here, he gives a very dark and gritty atmosphere to the film without ever compromising the comic book feel (the way the film is shot is almost TOO smart).
I:8424;143;The characters are shot in ways that accentuate their personalities and eventualities marvelously, using such clever technique to embellish what Shyamalan has crafted on the page.
I:8424;144;In fact, upon reflection I think that this direction may be even more accomplished and noteworthy than that of `The Sixth Sense'.
I:8424;145;the acting is all very appropriate and at times even moving.
I:8424;146;Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in `The Sixth Sense', and he follows that up with yet another very well controlled and admirable effort.
I:8424;147;Although he is known for his action films, for me he really shows a depth and range here that he should tap into more often.
I:8424;148;Robin Wright Penn is also quite impressive in her scenes, and although Jackson does come off somewhat clich d and campy at times, he evokes a genuine chill (as in `down the back of your spine') that captures Shyamalan's vision marvelously.
I:8424;149;I actually thought that the films best performance came from Spencer Treat Clark, who understood the balance between his characters fear and admiration of his father.
I:8424;150;it was stunning and only grows more and more haunting every time I see the film.
I:8424;151;this is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.
I:8424;152;"M. Night Shyamalan's best film ,after ""THE SIXTH SENSE""."
I:8424;153;shyamalan casted Bruce Willis as the comic.
I:8424;154;book hero(his best choice) and Samuel L. Jackson as the villain :Mr. glass.
I:8424;155;This film is touching, one of the greatest ,no doubt about it.
I:8424;156;M. night Shyamalan is one of the best directors.
I:8424;157;this film will be mentioned in future years and will be regarded as a classic.
I:8424;158;This could have been more suspenseful and interesting to watch.
I:8424;159;The mood that it was trying to portray was handled expertly by the costume and set designers.
I:8424;160;this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.
I:8424;161;unbreakable is a great movie that has you thinking the entire length of it.
I:8424;162;and it is true what they say in the movie there are two kinds of villians: one who fights the hero with his fists and one who fights the hero with his mind.
I:8424;163;and i think that the director did an excellent job in making the villian of the movie the second kind who fights with his mind.
I:8424;164;this is definitely a great foundation for future movies.
I:8424;165;While I liked it then, I found it better now.
I:8424;166;Seen now against the backdrop of all these films, Unbreakable makes much more sense.
I:8424;167;"the movie is extremely subtle
I:8424;168;"The story evolves slowly
I:8424;169;He turns the book around, and the camera also follows so that it is up.
I:8424;170;"side down again to us)
I:8424;171;"the ""twist"" ending is almost an anticlimax but very relevant."
I:8424;172;The cartoons, the comic books, the 80s TV shows that appear on shirts and toys now.
I:8424;173;Unbreakable celebrates an archetype that taught us how to imagine.
I:8424;174;It served as the foundation for our most powerful childhood games and fantasies.
I:8424;175;When you watch this movie, think to yourself how amazing it would be to have Bruce's gift.
I:8424;176;and it will be a cult classic.
I:8424;177;Some of the truly great movies made recently manage to be deep and powerful, but still remain exciting and fun to watch.
I:8424;178;The perfect example of this is The Matrix .
I:8424;179;It was naturally fun to watch because of the visual effects, but the premise of it and ingenious use of metaphors was also far more profound and intellectually stimulating than Unbreakable .
I:8424;180;dimensional to make the movie interesting.
I:8424;181;While I didn't like this movie, it had a few commendable attributes.
I:8424;182;His film, Unbreakable , explores the action comic philosophy without becoming an action comic itself.
I:8424;183;What you will see is a thoughtful investigation of the unusual skills we humans may or may not have, and the choices we make regarding their use.
I:8424;184;Where would it lead him?Unbreakable introduces us to such a man.
I:8424;185;But at least one other person takes note of David's uncanny good fortune.
I:8424;186;Elijah Price is an art dealer, played convincingly by Samuel L Jackson.
I:8424;187;His gallery specializes in comic art and he is very passionate about the seriousness of his chosen profession and it's medium.
I:8424;188;His theory is that there are people with extraordinary abilities and that these people have a destiny.
I:8424;189;shyamalan takes his time with this story.
I:8424;190;In a way, David's gradually more serious attempts to explore his gift become the catalyst to improve his home life.
I:8424;191;But to counter this we discover that David sacrificed a promising football career to capture Audrey's heart and, even in the hardest times, he has remained faithful to her.
I:8424;192;by far the most interesting character is Elijah.
I:8424;193;At school he was taunted with the moniker, Mr. Glass , and to an extent he has embraced this title.
I:8424;194;If you look closely, you will see that he is always close to glass, for example, his fragile glass walking stick.
I:8424;195;Elijah's passion and conviction are magnetic.
I:8424;196;unbreakable is a subtle film about taking risks, acknowledging hope and following dreams.
I:8424;197;"Whether we have special gifts or not, it challenges us to take a look around and try to find opportunities to make a difference
I:8424;198;I can only hope we see more of these inspiring characters in future films.
I:8424;199;It was deliberate, gripping, intriguing, and yet somehow, it still possessed an unimposing finesse.
I:8424;200;Unbreakable was an unfolding of a fable, a practical impossibility portrayed in a very real manner.
I:8424;201;the camerawork, music, lighting, choice of color, and soft.
I:8424;202;focus effects (in certain shots) sustained the perfect mood and atmosphere.
I:8424;203;I got a bit misty.
I:8424;204;the unabashed awe and love shared in that moment was priceless.
I:8424;205;I believe this movie was handled more carefully and the utmost attention was paid to detail, and to wonderful effect.
I:8424;206;The feeling I was left with after watching this movie is more than worth the price of admission.
I:8424;207;This moving was exactly what I expect from director M. n. Shyamalan.
I:8424;208;Like his other movie The Sixth Sense this movie is dark and filled with twists, fore.
I:8424;209;I really like the fact that Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were in this movie.
I:8424;210;Paired up once again for a great job casting and acting.
I:8424;211;I didn't see this movie before I bought it but I knew if Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were in it, it's a must see!
I:8424;212;david Dunn is a security guard with a wife and kid in a big city.
I:8424;213;In the process, he meets a rare comic book dealer who explains the universal structure of the guardian/hero archetype told through stories around the world:Heroes ?
I:8424;214;Solid performance by Bruce Willis, who is so very well.
I:8424;215;Samuel L. Jackson is his unforgettable counterpart Elijah, the comic bookstore owner .
I:8424;216;Just slightly slow pacing drags the plot a bit in places, but it is redeemed by a nice twist or two.
I:8424;217;recommended for fans of the dark and speculative genre.
I:8424;218;It's hard to find movies worth watching among all the trash that's out there, but this one is a good choice.
I:8424;219;Unbreakable wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was enjoyable.
I:8424;220;certainly, there is some real world backing.
I:8424;221;Abundant with exceptionally powerful heroes capable of superhuman feats.
I:8424;222;The rest of the movie is about David coming to realize Elijah is right and eventually comes to a twist ending.
I:8424;223;But I'm a patient man.
I:8424;224;Watch a couple episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you'll see films with directors who had no idea what pacing meant.
I:8424;225;It gives him faith and hope.
I:8424;226;on the better points, I loved the soundtrack.
I:8424;227;It was unique and distinct while at the same time having a classic air to it.
I:8424;228;Shyamalan said he wanted a soundtrack you would immediately recognize as Unbreakable's and he succeeded.
I:8424;229;the cinematography, lighting, and Shyamalan's trademark usage of colors and atmosphere also create a nice effect.
I:8424;230;He succeeds with those tricks in that they're executed subtly enough that you don't notice it unless you're actively looking for it.
I:8424;231;This technique is actually an influence for myself as a budding writer also experimenting with directing.
I:8424;232;i applaud M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker.
I:8424;233;His approach is daring, innovative, and creative, something we don't see enough of in Hollywood anymore.
I:8424;234;This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it.
I:8424;235;Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times.
I:8424;236;His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.
I:8424;237;but he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen.
I:8424;238;I'll just call an interesting fantasy.
I:8424;239;Unbreakable is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end.
I:8424;240;one of the best I've ever seen in a movie.
I:8424;241;The movie's build up was great.
I:8424;242;The back stories of each character led you to believe something great was gonna happen.
I:8424;243;Each person discovering their purpose and roles was the foundation for a epic ending battle.
I:8424;244;And Shyamalan became the most overrated director of all time.
I:8424;245;This movie is pretty good it actually has a plot and follows a story line and isn't just all action.
I:8424;246;"human"" strengths and abilities ."
I:8424;247;Still, there was something intriquing about the whole thing, and the acting was fairly good (given the one note that Willis was restricted to).
I:8424;248;hope you enjoy it more!
I:8424;249;M. Night Shyamalan followed The Sixth Sense with this offbeat film.
I:8424;250;While this film does not even come close to the brilliance of Sixth Sense , it does hold it's own by itself.
I:8424;251;Bruce Willis stars as a family man whose marriage on the rocks.
I:8424;252;He plays a comic book collector with a rare bone disease.
I:8424;253;Shyamalan delivers the moddy colors and haunting shots like in Sixth Sense .
I:8424;254;Jackson is really good in his role.
I:8424;255;Willis is really starting to become a 'real' actor.
I:8424;256;You'll either love it or absolutely hate it.
I:8424;257;A very unique premise, if a bit nuts.
I:8424;258;Giving the superhero a secret weakness was a good touch.
I:8424;259;The movie is a 'slow burner', but the payoff makes it worth it.
I:8424;260;The packaging for Unbreakable is gorgeous.
I:8424;261;There are 2 discs, one for the movie, one for the Special Features.
I:8424;262;The deleted scenes look and sound every bit as good as the movie itself, and appear in Widescreen format.
I:8424;263;This is by far my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie ever.
I:8424;264;Definitely a good gift idea.
I:8424;265;This movie is one of the best of all time outstanding cast, script, and direction M. Night Shyamalan is a genius the best part of the movie was after the movie when the audience walked out after realizing that this movie was based on a true story and the audience left TOTALLY silent if you haven't seen this movie its a must for your entire family
I:8424;266;at first, until he is found by Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;267;This is when Samuel L. Jackson,who runs an art studio of comic book heroes, finds Bruce Willis.
I:8424;268;He can visual a man or woman carrying a weapon or drugs when they just brush up against him.
I:8424;269;It is the twist at the end that will amaze and stun you.
I:8424;270;A well written screen play with excellent actors .
I:8424;271;even a 1960s comic book fan like me had had enough.
I:8424;272;Bascially this would of been a great short film.
I:8424;273;I am generally a great fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson and I greatly enjoyed The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;274;But even the surprise ending was a tremendous let down.
I:8424;275;On the other side, you see a man lying on a hospital bed, completely wrapped in bandages, and there is a growing spot of red that tells you the man is hemorrhaging.
I:8424;276;the idea of something like this happening prompts a series of thoughts to streak through your mind, and each of these thoughts is captured in director M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his masterful The Sixth Sense : Unbreakable.
I:8424;277;And I think I have to answer one question before I really dig into the guts of this review: No, this one isn't as good as The Sixth Sense, but it's still ridiculously good.
I:8424;278;Unbreakable examines a world of possibilities that is very similar to comic books.
I:8424;279;Someone whose destiny is to utilize his or her powers to protect the rest of us.
I:8424;280;David makes it his mission to find out, and he makes some incredible discoveries along the way.
I:8424;281;The cinematography is outstanding, giving this movie the look and feel of those impossibilities that we love seeing in comics.
I:8424;282;Shyamalan shows he is quite an established shot.
I:8424;283;maker, the best I've seen since Spielberg and Sam Raimi, and he uses his music (composed by Maestro James Newton Howard) to accent every scene perfectly.
I:8424;284;Unbreakable is an uncommonly absorbing film that gripped me from beginning to end.
I:8424;285;The visual style is incredible, the characters are believable, and the acting is stellar.
I:8424;286;The story is superbly executed and the characters are believable and interesting.
I:8424;287;While many have put down the shock ending I believe it works very well in the context of the movie.
I:8424;288;overall, Unbreakable is an enjoyable experience.
I:8424;289;"Great premise, characters, and camera directions
I:8424;290;I've been subject to many movies (most of them lately) that leave you with a sense of wanting so much more.
I:8424;291;All films should have such a great attention to detail as the director displayed in this one.
I:8424;292;Willis and Jackson have made very good movies together in the past, but this should rank as one of their all time best.
I:8424;293;I believe that it much better than the Sixth Sense.
I:8424;294;The main reason why I enjoyed this movie because it is unique.
I:8424;295;I think that M. Night Shyamalan should be considered as one of the great directors.
I:8424;296;This film is intresting because it has a sense of mystery and belief into the film.
I:8424;297;It was the right length.
I:8424;298;My favorite role in Unbreakable is Mr. Glass nemisis to Bruce Willis.
I:8424;299;The role is played by Samuel Jackson.
I:8424;300;I believe that this is his best role ever.
I:8424;301;Mr. Glass is the most interesting character I have ever whitnessed.
I:8424;302;The acting of this character was perfect.
I:8424;303;I believe that this movie was the best movie of the year 2000.
I:8424;304;It was powerful and gripping all the way through.
I:8424;305;It should at least have a nomination for best picture of the year.
I:8424;306;The best part of Unbreakable is the ending.
I:8424;307;If you thought that Sixth Sense was good then wait until you see this.
I:8424;308;there are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire.
I:8424;309;At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like.
I:8424;310;The acting was good in this movie and you don't know who the culprit is until the end but it's sort of on the dark side and I don't care for those kinds of movies, Jackson gives a good performance, I just didn't care for the story itself.
I:8424;311;Elijah suffers from a rare condition that makes his bones extremely brittle.
I:8424;312;For example, David develops further powers solely to move the story in the direction Shyamalan wishes it to go.
I:8424;313;Underrated, in a word, is M. Night Shymalan's 3rd film.
I:8424;314;known film, the 2nd made big with Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense), and this one reunites Shymalan and Willis, along with another screen legend, Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;315;he was born with all the bones broken in his body, somehow.
I:8424;316;james Newton Howard's score only accelerates the movie into high.
I:8424;317;Comic book fans loved it, as I did, because of Elijah's museum of comic book art, and his massive collection.
I:8424;318;"I like this director and, with the possible exception of ""The Village"" have found his movie making technique just as compelling ."
I:8424;319;"there has always been one particular aspect of ""Unbreakable"" that I found truly amazing: the movie is a comic book."
I:8424;320;"You could bring up ""Sin City"" in a conversation like this, but that film is remarkable for being on literally the opposite end of the spectrum: animation personified."
I:8424;321;Unbreakable is a classic example of a movie written, designed and made to look and feel a very specific way.
I:8424;322;Jackson, a man who believes comic book heroes live and breathe, is obsessed with David.
I:8424;323;He possesses certain knowledge of David's inner self that could very well change the course of his entire natural life.
I:8424;324;The story that unfolds from there on in is certainly one of the more original approaches to the whole superhero sub.
I:8424;325;genre that I can honestly say I have ever seen.
I:8424;326;shyamalan takes us on a journey that, while at times may seem easy to figure out, is chock full of mind.
I:8424;327;This is a movie that is guaranteed to keep you riveted to the screen.
I:8424;328;believe all the positive press you have heard.
I:8424;329;The second viewing was just incredible.
I:8424;330;When this movie is watched more for the character development than the plot, it is absolutely amazing.
I:8424;331;this is a great film.
I:8424;332;That takes patience and skills as actors and as a director.
I:8424;333;He takes the time to tell a story the way it should be told.
I:8424;334;Shyamalan slows down and lets a great story unfold.
I:8424;335;His style really harkens back to that of a legend like Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8424;336;I think this movie was actually very good.
I:8424;337;A man now, the child born at the beggining has a strange condition that makes his bones break very easily.
I:8424;338;He thinks that comic book superheroes are real, and that David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is one of them.
I:8424;339;One of the best thrillers of 2000, Unbreakable is writer/director M. Knight Shyamalan's follow up production to the 1998 blockbuster The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;340;Although not as phenomenally successful as that film, Unbreakable is nonetheless a memorable and suspense ridden picture certain to entertain.
I:8424;341;Shyamalan uses a unique comic book format to weave a tale of a superhero who fails to realize his own powers.
I:8424;342;dimensional with its characters, and the employment of special effects is not a focal point of the film.
I:8424;343;Instead, Unbreakable remains more of a mystery, thriller combination, and one that works well.
I:8424;344;Soon after, David is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), owner of a comic book art gallery and expert on the world of comics.
I:8424;345;human abilities, Elijah postulates that David is one such person.
I:8424;346;free days as a star football player.
I:8424;347;Now, he must convince David that he holds the aforementioned powers.
I:8424;348;As David comes to believe he holds the power of the 'unbreakable', he also develops an awareness of a special sense which gives him the ability to tell if someone has done, or is about to do, something sinister.
I:8424;349;As David comes to appreciate his special powers, the world around him crystallizes with a terrifying clarity.
I:8424;350;featuring one of the better surprise endings of the decade, Unbreakable is one of the reasons Shyamalan's reputation has risen to such a lofty position in the world of film.
I:8424;351;directed, M. Knight Shyamalan creates a brilliant follow up to The Sixth Sense with the dark and mysterious Unbreakable.
I:8424;352;Samuel L. Jackson plays his part well, employing the use of his penetrating stare and authoritative voice for maximum effect.
I:8424;353;Bruce Willis stars again in a role he knows well .
I:8424;354;although it lacked the commercial success and Academy Award speculation of its forerunner, Unbreakable is nevertheless an entertaining film.
I:8424;355;Weaving a strange and exotic tale of two men who lead opposite lives in the physical realm, it makes deft use of cinematography and dripping suspense to leave its audience perched on the edge of curiosity.
I:8424;356;As a result, Unbreakable made a place for itself among the best films of 2000, and it definitely ranks as a must.
I:8424;357;It's very unique and NOT for everyone.
I:8424;358;This movie deals with the questions of how a hero is made.
I:8424;359;rushed, but it's still a highly original and entertaining film.
I:8424;360;Kudos to all those involved.
I:8424;361;It is a wonderful watch.
I:8424;362;The cinematography is quiet and persuasive, drawing you into each scene.
I:8424;363;"Where other ""comic hero"" films try to wring ""ahhhs"" from there audience with flashy special effects and shocking violence, this one does it with a simple look of the eyes and a well placed close."
I:8424;364;This is a film where simplicity of story and honest characters sweep you into another world and make you believe in wonder.
I:8424;365;Following a similar style to The Sixth Sense , Unbreakable is a thriller that hides the main punch until the end, and provides little hints to what that punch will be.
I:8424;366;This movie is the first one that has made me write a review.
I:8424;367;It has a clever premise that works well up until the end.
I:8424;368;This is M Night's best film in my opinion.
I:8424;369;It is the most grounded in reality and also the most emotional.
I:8424;370;Thankfully someone in Blu Ray heaven loves it as much as I do.
I:8424;371;A great film gets is place on blu ray!
I:8424;372;he also meets a man called Elijah(played by Samuel L. jackson) that it's the exact oppost of dunnes,he was born crippled,and will change David Dunne's life forever!As you can see,the plot offers something new,fresh and interesting,and the cast it's pretty good,featuring very well known stars such as Bruce Willis,Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn. the director is also pretty good .
I:8424;373;a very good concept movie,but very frankly,the results could have been better.
I:8424;374;I can believe he has that much talent based on this film and a few of his others.
I:8424;375;Here you can see it with an end scene he has, with the boy who plays his son in this movie, when he shares a newspaper article with him at the breakfast table.
I:8424;376;Willis is all but unbreakable, like a superhero in a comic book, as he comes to discover with Jackson's help, whereas Jackson's bones break so easily he was called Mr. Glass as a kid.
I:8424;377;Jackson now runs an art gallery which features comic book art.
I:8424;378;director M. Night Shyamalan also made Sixth Sense and I must credit him for having a wonderful imagination that doesn't just recycle and reuse Hollywood ideas already overused.
I:8424;379;He also can make a gripping film without using explosions, car crashes, gunfire, blood and guts and the other, more usual action.
I:8424;380;Shyamalan is fascinated by comic books as both art form and myth maker and brings that fascination home to us.
I:8424;381;Shyamalan is very good at handling child actors in his films and Clark adds a lot to the story line with his belief in his father's powers.
I:8424;382;Robin Wright Penn is fast becoming the solid character actress upon whom directors can really rely.
I:8424;383;They probably picked up on that fact from her husband's (Sean Penn) using her in his films to marvelous effect.
I:8424;384;This is a solid movie which is nothing short of solid entertainment.
I:8424;385;plots, Unbreakable keeps you wanting more!
I:8424;386;Nontheless, Unbreakable is thoroughly entertaining even though I felt I should have gotten even more out of it.
I:8424;387;The only way a man as big, strong and healthy looking could convince me he had O. i. is if he was one of those rare actors who could inhabit the role and become the fragile person the character was meant to be.
I:8424;388;It is a rare talent.
I:8424;389;I once had an acting instructor, 20 something at the time, with no make up, costume or props, he transformed himself into a little old man, before the entire class.
I:8424;390;That is a rare talent.
I:8424;391;This said, if you can ignore or get past this incongruity the movie is a fine piece of imagination and execution in all other ways.
I:8424;392;I stand by this, as with most people, that UNBREAKABLE was one the best film of 2000, if not the best.
I:8424;393;The pacing of the film is so subtle, but fast at the same time.
I:8424;394;This is a wonderful story of one man true meaning in life, his self.
I:8424;395;And, to be frank, the build to the ending, and the ending itself is something that is worth the wait.
I:8424;396;Super heros are making an impression with the Fantastic Four and Spiderman at the top of the box office recently.
I:8424;397;The idea is creative enough, Willis is essentially an indestructable superhero, Samuel L. Jackson is a guy trying to convince him of it.
I:8424;398;it lays a good groundwork for a great movie.
I:8424;399;The movie is similar in style to The Sixth Sense thanks to the trade make unpredictable ending.
I:8424;400;All of the performances from the actors were good especially the strage guy with a rare disorder of having extremely breakable bones as portraited by Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;401;The bottom line is that the movie does draw you in and thus it is entertaining.
I:8424;402;This movie in my opinion was the best movie of 2000.
I:8424;403;Unbreakable is an amazing movie and I am not surprised at all that many people didn't like it.
I:8424;404;It is the age old story of good and evil, and of a hero coming to terms with who he is.
I:8424;405;This movie makes me feel good because it shows that there can be a hero in all of us if we just reach our potential.
I:8424;406;I'm a Bruce Willis fannot always, but most of the time.
I:8424;407;I'm also a Samuel L. Jackson fan.
I:8424;408;And I loved The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;409;So now comes Unbreakable, with a premise that is wonderful.
I:8424;410;As the ultimate breakable man, Jackson is angry, inscrutable, and brilliant.
I:8424;411;"the director has a wonderful feel for children, for their fears and sensitivities
I:8424;412;ninety percent of this film is highly compelling.
I:8424;413;It's a strong, chilling sequence.
I:8424;414;this is a movie about superheroes and villians but grounded in reality making it all the more intense and satisfying.
I:8424;415;Unbreakable is a revelation in commercial filmmaking.
I:8424;416;The director, M. night Shyamalan aimed to combine art house flamboyance with mainstream sensibilities, and as a result has made one of the most misunderstood and underrated films of the last decade.
I:8424;417;the film possesses a strict style.
I:8424;418;Kubrick's visual legacy lives on in every frame of this film.
I:8424;419;"Unbreakable will begin to be realised for what it truly is
I:8424;420;eight minutes Bruce Willis is on a voyage like Travis Bickle, searching for his identity, wanting to make a change in his life and the world that surrounds him.
I:8424;421;bruce Willis is perfectly cast as David Dunn, a man whose potential has not yet been realised.
I:8424;422;Willis may continue to make average action films but every now and again he reminds us all of his acting talents.
I:8424;423;Obviously this performance was TOO good for the Academy.
I:8424;424;unbreakable continues to be a rewarding cinematic experience.
I:8424;425;I respect the director for his intelligence but also his courage to make an atypical Hollywood movie that holds up the mirror to our souls and begs us to ask the same question.
I:8424;426;It entertained and informed me, which really makes this an excellent piece of material to watch.
I:8424;427;It illuminates Unbreakable to the point where you watch the film in an entirely new perspective.
I:8424;428;rate, and reveals just how good a filmmaker Shyamalan is.
I:8424;429;"then there is ""An Excerpt From a Childhood Film of M. Night Shyamalan"" It is so charming to see a director at the age of ten (or whatever) making his own short film."
I:8424;430;"angle Feature and Sound Mix"" is kinda cool."
I:8424;431;"Another winning matchup of Bruce Willis and M. Night Shyamalan brings a new twist to the ""comic book hero discovers he has powers"" story."
I:8424;432;In this film, Samuel L. Jackson is a comics collector and suffers from a rare malady that makes his bones brittle.
I:8424;433;the film is dark, and yet it contains some important themes .
I:8424;434;if I can borrow a line from another great superhero film .
I:8424;435;"is ""with great power comes great responsibility."
I:8424;436;Willis' character evolves as he begins to accept his incredible skills, and finally comes to peace with his life.Yes, its a bit slow.
I:8424;437;It builds, and then it delivers.
I:8424;438;written and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Sings, Wide Awake) made an strong, extremely underrated film that is a first.
I:8424;439;The most underrated film of the year: 2000.
I:8424;440;unbreakable is the movie adaptation of a comic book origin issue.
I:8424;441;eyed wonder at the transformation of his father, to Samuel L. Jackson's character, who is obsessed with comic books, this movie is the perfect distillation of a superhero's beginnings.
I:8424;442;"my favorite scene is in the train station
I:8424;443;It's perfect for a comic book movie, and it's the one that makes the most sense.
I:8424;444;com and wanted to look at some lists compiled by people, with their favorite movies on here.
I:8424;445;well, came across this little gem, and thought that I would check it out.
I:8424;446;The story was very well told, excellent visuals, actors did a wonderful job with the material.
I:8424;447;it gave the story another interesting angle.
I:8424;448;After the Sixth Sense, I waited with great anticipation for this movie.
I:8424;449;The premise is wonderful, Bruce Willis plays the only survivor of a train crash and Samuel L. Jackson plays a fragile comic book collector who believes that not only do superheroes exist but that Willis is one of them.
I:8424;450;I read a review of Unbreakable in the Cincinnati Enquirer and the writer said the movie was great.
I:8424;451;He also said that the ending was some surprising twist.
I:8424;452;the best part of the movie, without giving away too much, is the action scene.
I:8424;453;I like the actors, so I sat through this for their performances and I kept thinking something in the story would make it worth it.
I:8424;454;Great movie that stems from Comic book Ideals and just when you think you got it all figured out it throws you through a loop and the ending might shock you!
I:8424;455;Willis, again, manages his role with the skill you'd expect.
I:8424;456;I've heard that, if you are familliar with Comic Books, this is a great film.
I:8424;457;Some good points are the acting: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn all do GREAT jobs, they're really believable as would.
I:8424;458;How can James Cameron top Titanic, which is still the top money.
I:8424;459;And George Lucas will pretty much be that Star Wars dude.
I:8424;460;Upstart director M Night Shyamalan came out with The Sixth Sense, an intriguing thriller with one of the best and well.
I:8424;461;the trailer was probably the most interesting thing about the film.
I:8424;462;It comes out and it mentions comic books.
I:8424;463;What is here though is intriguing regardless.
I:8424;464;I always was fascinated by mythology and special abilities that comic books can bring so of course, me and my nerdness gravitated towards this.
I:8424;465;"When David is told that something is like his kryptonite it's kind of like ""oh, boy""."
I:8424;466;wise it's good all around.
I:8424;467;dryer and full pimpness complete with cane, it comes a bit close to campy.
I:8424;468;It's a good film, not great.
I:8424;469;There is a notion that all of us have a particular talent or power within us, which must be used, defining our place and purpose in life.
I:8424;470;are you fulfilling your destiny?David Dunn (Bruce Willis) certainly feels this sadness.
I:8424;471;If you haven't seen ~Unbreakable~ Dunn's true calling will surprise you.
I:8424;472;shyamalan's talent as a filmmaker is without question .
I:8424;473;he uses certain techniques to create a suspense.
I:8424;474;everything about this film, screenplay, direction, editing and the performances are first rate.
I:8424;475;~Unbreakable~ is a five star viewing experience.
I:8424;476;I liked the ending ~ I can't usually say that about movies.
I:8424;477;A sequel could easily follow, yet the ending was still satisfying to me.
I:8424;478;This is a super hero movie, yet, actually manages to seem plausible.
I:8424;479;Both the lead actors are great.
I:8424;480;This chilling movie will leave you to ponder right up to the end, then when you get there your mind is challenged with another one of Shyamalan surprise endings.
I:8424;481;I highy recomend this classic film.
I:8424;482;Instead, Unbreakable brings you something fresh and innovative.
I:8424;483;There are plenty of movies out there with flashy special effects and sappy, overdone love themes.
I:8424;484;The characters are well defined and you will find yourself caught in their viewpoints several times throughout the movie.
I:8424;485;If this is part of a trilogy, as anticipated, it is a great starting point.
I:8424;486;Unbreakable is one of the best original movies I have seen in a long time and I look forward to the section chapter.
I:8424;487;The character studies intriguing and plot is suspenseful.
I:8424;488;key thriller, with a plot that twists in several intriguing and unexpected directions.
I:8424;489;director M. Night Shyamalan's daring follow.
I:8424;490;While just as assured as that earlier, phenomenal hit, Unbreakable is the work of a filmmaker whose skill exceeds his maturity, its confident style serving a story that borders on juvenile.
I:8424;491;that comic books are the primary conduit of modern mythology.
I:8424;492;is handled with substantial relevance.
I:8424;493;When prompted by a mysterious, brittle.
I:8424;494;exist in reality, and that Willis himself possesses extraordinary powers.
I:8424;495;Shyamalan presents these revelations with matter.
I:8424;496;fact gravity, and he draws performances (including those of Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark, as Willis's wife and son) that are uniformly superb.
I:8424;497;The film's climactic revelation may strike some as ultimately silly and trivial, but if you're on Shyamalan's wavelength, the entire film will assume a greater degree of success and achievement.
I:8424;498;Great movie, it's not a classic like Shaw Shank redemption(sp?)
I:8424;499;, but it's one that will stick with you.
I:8424;500;I must admit that I really liked this movie.
I:8424;501;Sure, The Sixth Sense was better, but this movie offers something we rarely see: a complete introduction to a comic book style of characters.
I:8424;502;Because that's what it is, a comic book story, M. Night Shyamalan says it himself.
I:8424;503;the entire movie revolves around this seemingly normal guy who finds out, from a rather weird man, that he is more than an ordinary human being, he has a gift which he must use.
I:8424;504;The movie draws a lot toward the darker aspect of comic books.
I:8424;505;Well, in a comic book type of mentality.
I:8424;506;This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it (which is 4 times, so far).
I:8424;507;Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times.
I:8424;508;His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.
I:8424;509;but he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen.
I:8424;510;I'll just call it an interesting fantasy.
I:8424;511;Unbreakable is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end.
I:8424;512;one of the best I've ever seen in a movie.
I:8424;513;I really enjoyed this film.
I:8424;514;It's an interesting perspective on the true comic book hero.
I:8424;515;The movie gives you an insight on how a real life hero comes to grasps with his powers and his purpose in life.
I:8424;516;If this film would have been presented as a tribute to comic books, maybe people would have enjoyed it more!
I:8424;517;It may seem slow moving at times but it is the eeriness that made me enjoy this movie.
I:8424;518;If you appreciate good movie making, cinematography, and sound design you'll enjoy this movie.
I:8424;519;All in all a very watchable movie and a new concept in movie making.
I:8424;520;On it's own a good movie with fine acting by Willis,and a good plot twist but the ending is only satisfying if you know it's part one of three.
I:8424;521;It goes like this: Introducion, rising action, climax, falling action, and the resolution.
I:8424;522;I view it simply as an introductory chapter to a brilliant story.
I:8424;523;i think that Shyamalan is a level above the thinking of the impatient masses, and that shows when you read many of these negative reviews.
I:8424;524;as for me, I will simply enjoy this movie whenever I watch it and eagely look forward to the sequels.
I:8424;525;This work is a fictional account of a seemingly ordinary man who possesses an extraordinary gift.
I:8424;526;There is just something about the characters he plays that draws me to see most of his movies.
I:8424;527;I recommend this film to all.
I:8424;528;Beings that M. Nights new movie 'Lady in the Water' is released today I decided to take a look at his previous films.
I:8424;529;I've already reviewed 'The Sixth Sense' and anyone who knows me knows that I hold that film in the highest regard, as one of the best 'ghost' films for it's smart script and excellent direction, not to mention the chemistry between Haley and Bruce.
I:8424;530;As everyone knows, I feel that Night has done no better than 'Sixth Sense' and I fear he never will BUT 'Unbreakable' is a very close second for many reasons.
I:8424;531;The opening scene has David on a train travelling home from a job interview and he is seated next to a beautiful woman.
I:8424;532;But here's what makes this movie so great to me.
I:8424;533;much greater purpose than to be a security guard who once had dreams of something greater (we see in flashbacks that David had dreams to once be a pro.
I:8424;534;Knowing he had a place made him whole, made him happy, and made him see that what he had was what he wanted.
I:8424;535;the entire cast is superb, Willis especially, and the story and direction is Shyamalan at his best.
I:8424;536;Yes, since 'The Sixth Sense' Night has slipped from a lot of people's lists and has somewhat become concidered a dissapointment (I think this is mostly due to poor advertising), but when looked at properly he really is a magnificent storyteller.
I:8424;537;The final frames will leave you breathless and will send shockwaves down your spine.
I:8424;538;I feel it's a brilliant film with a universal message we can all appreciate and understand.
I:8424;539;I saw this movie the very first day it debuted.
I:8424;540;in my opinion this was a great movie because of its twists and turns, the way it was presented, etc.
I:8424;541;great shots and camera angles, great lighting, great vison and this is one director to keep an eye on.
I:8424;542;because this movie is truly a comic book come to life in a movie setting.
I:8424;543;"Ah yes, here we have another example of the ""genius"" of M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/director with the uncanny ability to take a silly, fantastical story and transform it into a film that is ."
I:8424;544;The Sixth Sense was a great movie, but viewings of Lady in the Water and Unbreakable have me convinced that Shyamalan is the most overrated filmmaker to come along in years.
I:8424;545;Thus it is that Unbreakable, a film largely inspired by comic books, is presented as if it's a cinematic masterpiece of life.
I:8424;546;Eventually, Elijah gets under David's skin, which leads us up to the film's final scenes.
I:8424;547;"Now, you do get the vintage Shyamalan twist at the very end, but the effort required to sit through this movie all the way to the end greatly exceeds the payoff of that ""surprise."""
I:8424;548;hit wonder for this filmmaker.
I:8424;549;this film clearly showed us all that m. night shyamalan is the present day Hitchcock With the sixth sense already under his belt, unbreakable shocked everyone in that this guy is one great film maker.
I:8424;550;it has everything you want in a movie, suspense, originality, and the element of surprise.
I:8424;551;But everything else was so much fun!
I:8424;552;The moment when the hero is pulled from the water and stands in the rain ready to do battle again and the music soars.
I:8424;553;"While this isn't ""Watchmen"", it is a perfect distillation of what comic books mean to those who read them and the pure sense of hope they can offer.Yes, I said hope."
I:8424;554;"But if you're impatient, I can only explain it this way
I:8424;555;Comics are an uniquely American creation, but the characters strike a deep human chord.
I:8424;556;and there, carved out of a whole tree, was a statue of Superman.
I:8424;557;"It's a really inspiring sight, and it's something I suspect MNS heard about, because he tapped into it deeply with ""Unbreakable."""
I:8424;558;His character of David Dunn is denying what he is to such a degree it's destroying his marriage, his relationship with his son and folding him into himself, rendering him number with each passing day.
I:8424;559;"In a lot of ways, ""Unbreakable"" is the ultimate comic book movie, and for those who know what that truly means, they know that's the greatest compliment anyone can bestow on it."
I:8424;560;That's the one, you got him pegged.
I:8424;561;"M. Night Shyamalan leads us right down that particular rabbit hole in the eerily profound and deeply moving ""Unbreakable"", his meditation about the meaning of a superhero in a callow age."
I:8424;562;"He checks out his seatmate
I:8424;563;and she's lithe, tall, slender, good facial structure.
I:8424;564;"agent on her way to meet with a rising young football star
I:8424;565;She gets creeped out and takes a seat a few rows down.
I:8424;566;just as with ghosts and werewolves and vampires, you can deal every day with arguments against.
I:8424;567;but it only takes one true positive to change the world.
I:8424;568;the superficial have called Shyamalan a great many things: a spooky director, a horror director, a 'twist' director.
I:8424;569;but in fact, M. Night has really always been interested in probing the Human Soul, and has tilted at a wide range of genres.
I:8424;570;What distinguishes us from the animals.
I:8424;571;And as this strangely sedate, moody piece winds its way to culmination, we find that Dunn's price is extraordinary frightening.
I:8424;572;finally, M. Night proves again that he's an actor's director: this moodpiece is brought off nicely by essentially four actors: Willis playing it with brooding.
I:8424;573;"understatement as David Dunn
I:8424;574;Prepare to be have your emotions broken.
I:8424;575;I'll say this, the movie is intriguing.
I:8424;576;And so shamalamadingdong saw that and said WOW that's amazing i'm going to make all my movies have a twist ending because it's awesome!
I:8424;577;Now, here's the difference: if you watch all of the usual suspects EXCEPT the surprise ending, it's still a great movie.
I:8424;578;It's seriously all the man knows.
I:8424;579;everything except the endingThe film is well done, but that's like saying you're a C student in an ivy league school.
I:8424;580;The melodrama is engaging, you're basically going along with this character finding out things as he finds them out, and it generally keeps your interest.
I:8424;581;samuel jackson also puts on a great show.
I:8424;582;"What I liked: takes place in Philadelphia, where I grew up
I:8424;583;This is a great movie for those times.
I:8424;584;"It is a ""dark"" movie."
I:8424;585;As you watch the film, you watch him discover who he is.
I:8424;586;loved those and the way the tension builds.
I:8424;587;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give superb performances here.
I:8424;588;This movie from start to finish is awesome.
I:8424;589;I became a fan of the director M. Night Shyamalan after The Sixth Sense , and now that I've seen Unbreakable it just makes him that much greater.
I:8424;590;This guy has a certain way to make you think in a movie, he gets you involved, grabs a hold of you, then right out of the blue pulls the carpet out from under you.
I:8424;591;Fine actors such as Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson make good movies, but when you can put that together with the mastermind of Shyamalan, then you have a work of art.
I:8424;592;Like his previous film 'The Sixth Sense', writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' begins with a simple mystery then slowly peels back layer after layer until it reaches an emotional, startling conclusion.
I:8424;593;When he leaves he finds a note under the windshield wiper of his car.
I:8424;594;All the players are excellent.
I:8424;595;Bruce Willis continues to shine under Shaymalan's direction, providing a strong emotional pull with his portrayal of David.
I:8424;596;And Samuel L. Jackson's Elijah is tragic and mysterious.
I:8424;597;But the real star of the show is Shaymalan himself who once again crafts a masterpiece of mystery and suspense, showing his remarkable restraint and patience.
I:8424;598;This film does wrap itself up nicely, with a great twist ending but it definitely ends too soon and too quickly.
I:8424;599;But after watching it, after you realize what you've just seen happen on the screen, you'll understand completely.
I:8424;600;The ability to watch the amazing train sequence of the film in both it's storyboard and film representations is nice though and does give the viewer a good idea of just how much time went into plotting the film's look and feel.
I:8424;601;All in all this is a good package of a great film.
I:8424;602;Fans of 'The Sixth Sense' should feel right at home.
I:8424;603;"I consider ""Unbreakable"" one of the the best movies I have seen in the last few years."
I:8424;604;unbreakable is really the story of the modern world's first superhero, and how he struggles to come to terms with the fact that he is superhuman.
I:8424;605;I feel that Unbreakable portrays this in a great manner.
I:8424;606;He keeps his son at a great distance.
I:8424;607;The comic book art that decorates a number of settings pops.
I:8424;608;A number of scenes are shot at night or in otherwise dim lighting, and they look great on blu.
I:8424;609;The dialogue was clear and the score was moody and atmospheric, like a good thriller ought to be.
I:8424;610;the movie exceeds Sixth Sense in almost every way.
I:8424;611;Willis and Jackson give superb performances and the supporting cast is wonderful.
I:8424;612;unbreakable while sharing many attributes of Sixth Sense is not the same movie and from my perspective that makes it a fine and worthwhile movie to watch and own.
I:8424;613;This is one of those films that you will either love or hate.
I:8424;614;"this film is very deliberately paced, and will probably not appeal to people who like their entertainment served up fast and hot
I:8424;615;even if you don't enjoy the film itself, however, the available extras may be fascinating, especially if you are an avid comic.
I:8424;616;Unbreakable is a very powerful, well.
I:8424;617;The imagery and character development are excellent, the story intriguing, the writing very good.
I:8424;618;I won't ruin it for you, but the movie builds up and builds up and then.
I:8424;619;But this film, while moving much slower, still produces a beautiful story that keeps the comic book idea within the realm of reality.
I:8424;620;our heroes and villians may not fly or call upon lightning, but they are still heroes and villians.
I:8424;621;"Like most of Shyamalan's films, ""Unbreakable"" begins beautifully and cryptically."
I:8424;622;willis' understated delivery is perfect for Shyamalan's style of cinematic suspense.
I:8424;623;Robin Wright Penn and Samuel L. Jackson follow suit with lines delivered so delicately and with such restraint that they contribute to the tension.
I:8424;624;The cinematography is brilliant, setting the mood with aplomb.
I:8424;625;Unbreakable gives us another strong performance from Bruce Willis.
I:8424;626;Although almost no critics have mentioned it, Bruce Willis is actually a tremendous actor.
I:8424;627;He has cultivated that sort of action star persona that has worked extremely well in the Die Hard movies, but Willis' talents far exceed that of his genre colleges such as Jean.
I:8424;628;hero, mostly regular guy, reputation.
I:8424;629;This film takes great efforts to examine the mind of, not only the idealized superheros we've all grown up admiring, but the connections to the real.
I:8424;630;Holding together the entire film is Willis' believeable performance witch is both powerful and heartbreaking.
I:8424;631;course dinner with an interesting storyteller.
I:8424;632;If you are willing to let it unfold at its own pace, the rewards are incredible.
I:8424;633;unbreakable rewards multiple viewings because of a dense storyline, a visually rich cinematography, and a tightly.
I:8424;634;My wife watched it with me, and she agreed that the ending was outstanding and unexpected.
I:8424;635;i have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8424;636;This is a quite good film which I am not sure of giving it 3 or 4 stars.
I:8424;637;the film itself is good (so it deserves 4 stars) but the comparison with Sixth Sense is irresistible, and then Unbreakable clearly looses the game.
I:8424;638;Unbreakable has good some great moments, mainly in the first part of the film.
I:8424;639;The scene into the train with Willis (David Dunn) talking to the girl close to him is memorable, as some dialogs with his wife (almost ex.
I:8424;640;the real good thing is to see Willis and Jackson far from what.
I:8424;641;all in all, it's a film that I recommend you, even more if you haven't seen Sixth Sense .
I:8424;642;Great Bruce Willis movie, has real world troubled life that people can relate to and a little bit of fantasy that isn't too far fetched.
I:8424;643;M. Night Shyamalan followed up The Sixth Sense with this very good supernatural thriller.
I:8424;644;Shyamalan is assimilated with Steven Spielberg, I think, at a younger age of course.
I:8424;645;He is so good at making movies that I presume that one day he will make movies like that of Spielberg.
I:8424;646;Bruce Willis was awesome, as always, and Samuel L. Jackson stole every scene that he was in from Willis.
I:8424;647;The supporting actors gave good performances as well including Robin Wrigh.
I:8424;648;All I can say is that it was a very good movie and all the cast members did extraordinaarly good and it just was an overall good movie.
I:8424;649;up feature to that success, didn't do as good as its predecessor, and upon watching it for the first time, I can't understand why.
I:8424;650;There are elements at work throughout its discourse that, under Shyamalan's brilliant direction, fit together in an intricate puzzle that comes to an earth.
I:8424;651;It's a brilliant and complex piece of filmmaking.
I:8424;652;In taking his time with the story, he is able to allow David to evolve from a hardened, unbelieving survivor into someone forever changed by the realization that the he possesses can be put to good use.
I:8424;653;But I will say this: it's sheer brilliance.
I:8424;654;It then evolves into a story of realization and revelation, and just as in the previous film, there's a surprise twist ending, one that is more shocking and unexpected.
I:8424;655;"shyamalan made the right choice in bringing Bruce Willis back for this project
I:8424;656;There's the same subtle suspense and rising intensity you'd expect from its director, the same magic, the same awe.
I:8424;657;Everything fits together, it's dynamic, it's intriguing.
I:8424;658;What I'd like to point out are the aspects of the film that I found especially, well, special.
I:8424;659;First off, David's son was moved by pride in his dad and frustration that he'll never be like him.
I:8424;660;Probably, given his resistance to impact and lacerations, even from razor.
I:8424;661;sharp metal and broken glass.
I:8424;662;M. Night Shyamalan must be the director with the most popular first movie ever.
I:8424;663;The Sixth Sense showed his remarkable style, with which he returns to old fashioned movie making.
I:8424;664;But Shyamalan knows as no other how to keep the interest of the audience captivated untill the very last revelation, which comes, just like in The Sixth Sense, with a flash, at the end of the movie which just leaves the viewer speechless.
I:8424;665;And how unlikely the story might sound, it's done with such a feel of realism and emotions, that you just believe it's all real.
I:8424;666;in his previous movie Shyamalan made us believe in spirits, wondering around in our world.
I:8424;667;Now, he takes the classic superhero story and makes it his own.
I:8424;668;once again, James Newton Howard delivered a terrific score and the cast is terrific (especially Samuel L. Jackson, he gives his best performance ever!)
I:8424;669;The greatest thing is that you know what kind of movie you've watched only at the very end.
I:8424;670;I just love M Night Shyamalan's movies.
I:8424;671;"They keep you spellbound and that is exactly what ""Unbreakable"" does."
I:8424;672;I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes to sit on the edge of their seat.
I:8424;673;You know, the thing that truly shocks me is that after decades of some of the greatest Comic writers of our times.
I:8424;674;This is quite possibly the greatest SuperHero story ever written.
I:8424;675;It's a very modern story with a very realistic twist.
I:8424;676;But ultimately it comes down to good and evil.you just don't know it until you get to the end.
I:8424;677;Like your personal bubble has burst and that you just let someone get in and shock you.
I:8424;678;True genius just like The 6th Sense.
I:8424;679;In my humble opinion, this is Night's best work to date.
I:8424;680;Sam Jackson gives an underrated performance as the mysterious stranger, bent on opening Willis' eyes to the truth.
I:8424;681;For me, this movie works on an emotional level more than almost any other movie I have ever seen.
I:8424;682;Samuel Jackson's performance as the mysterious artist and commic book collector, seeking to answer these questions, and justify his own existence is riveting.
I:8424;683;In the process of testing his theory, he pushes the Bruce Willis character to remember, acknowledge and use his gifts.
I:8424;684;You will be gripping your chairs!
I:8424;685;"very comic book(ish) in framing style and its telling but in a deranged way makes a very ""real life"" clear point."
I:8424;686;i'm a believer in this way of thinking so this was for me a very good movie to watch and then ponder.
I:8424;687;I enjoyed The Sixth Sense , M. Night Shyamalan's previous film (and to which, by some critics with incredible perceptual problems, Unbreakable was described as a sequel.
I:8424;688;it is most assuredly not, in any accepted use of the term.)
I:8424;689;"
I:8424;690;The two of them were fantastic in Pulp Fiction , and I looked forward to seeing them together again.
I:8424;691;But I found Unbreakable absolutely excruciating.
I:8424;692;a story with little action but great writing.
I:8424;693;dialogue or plot, or with fascinating character development will captivate me.
I:8424;694;I've got to put it down to the direction.
I:8424;695;The twist at the end with Jackson's character is rather good, but I had so totally lost interest in the entire film by that time that I simply didn't care, and I found it absolutely unbelievable.
I:8424;696;break me, you sweet unbreakable you.
I:8424;697;This movie said it had surprises in it, but I was able to see right through everything pretty much from the first frame.
I:8424;698;It is entertaining, I guess, but the whole concept of comic books is silly.
I:8424;699;In the denouement, with Jackson's help, he finds that place.
I:8424;700;in every aspect, and especially the directorial, This movie is in one word stunning.
I:8424;701;Photography put you in angles that made you feel like your'e in a comic book, and the next one as if your'e watching a work of art.
I:8424;702;i would gladly recommend it for everyone, but I will have to say this movie isn't for everyone.
I:8424;703;thank you M. Night Shyamalan for a movie that seemed to have only moved me.
I:8424;704;Glad I finally found it.
I:8424;705;Nice to get it at a bargain price for my VCR
I:8424;706;Bruce Willis is great in this movie.
I:8424;707;Seeing the movie for a second time, you realize just how brilliant this film is.
I:8424;708;matrix for comic book fans.
I:8424;709;It is a very stylish film.
I:8424;710;It's a realistic comic movie wherein the protagonist slowly understands and believes his place in the world.
I:8424;711;That is much more interesting than a guy who had a messed up childhood and takes his anger out on all crooks in his rubber suit.
I:8424;712;If you are a repeat viewer i hope you enjoyed this film as much as i did my second time.
I:8424;713;This is the best comic/superhero movie since the first batman came along.
I:8424;714;It doesn't beat you over the head, its subtle and beautifully crafted.
I:8424;715;If you love comic books, this movie will send chills down your spine, if you don't, you'll still like it.
I:8424;716;fantastic movie, wonderful directing and acting.
I:8424;717;"real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL ""men of steel""?"
I:8424;718;discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals.
I:8424;719;But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers.
I:8424;720;Superhero movie usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes.
I:8424;721;Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.
I:8424;722;"instead of action, ""Unbreakable"" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities."
I:8424;723;"bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is ""unbreakable."""
I:8424;724;intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world.
I:8424;725;His powerful personality balances out his frail body.
I:8424;726;moving, suspenseful movie about a hero's awakening.
I:8424;727;I found Unbreakable interesting and intriguing.
I:8424;728;I thoroughly enjoyed the entire film, the slow, methodical way the plot is revealed (the film studios would do well to follow this example).
I:8424;729;It was great to see something where everything isn't revealed immediately, where some things go unexplained (as in The Sixth Sense).
I:8424;730;I absolutely love this movie.
I:8424;731;Its in depth character development and it unravels in a great way.
I:8424;732;The two former may be considered symptoms or byproducts of the latter, but all emphasize his struggle with self worth and identity.
I:8424;733;this identity struggle is what allows for a perfect blend of transition into the concept of being super human, a comic book like super hero.
I:8424;734;the last thing I will say is I enjoyed the presentation of a possibility being given as a rational corporeal explanation for what we fictionalize and adorn as supernatural.
I:8424;735;This movie is one of the best BW has done.
I:8424;736;Slow moving on purpose and great acting.
I:8424;737;Once a year a good movie comes out that is unique and worth the watch
I:8424;738;and it is nice to have a film like this from his heyday.
I:8424;739;My wife and I love nearly every film he's made.
I:8424;740;here is the classic story of the superhero.
I:8424;741;Except, of course, Night is at the helm which means nothing will be as it seems yet all will be revealed that was right in front of us all along.
I:8424;742;"well, you be the judge!The fun of this film in my opinion is mostly Willis discovering who he really is
I:8424;743;Shyamalan wants the audience to THINK.
I:8424;744;This film certainly provokes thoughts that reach far beyond the world of comic book villains and heroes.
I:8424;745;here, Shyamalan tells a better tale than ever: we all have better angels to our natures but we can also be turned into monsters.
I:8424;746;Get this and learn what a master director can do with very, very little.
I:8424;747;So it was really a let down but we'll see what happens with this summer's Signs, maybe, hopefully, it will be better.
I:8424;748;Unbreakable is one of the most original and entertaining movies I've seen in awhile.
I:8424;749;The story involves Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson and their interactions.
I:8424;750;The film builds suspense slowly and has a great ending.
I:8424;751;The brilliant acting from Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson and also Dunn's son propels this from mediocre movie to great.
I:8424;752;It also has a basic plot but it is the way it is executed that makes this a good movie.
I:8424;753;The ending was definitely a surprise.
I:8424;754;If you want an all out action film like Die Hard 3 dont watch this but otherwise, You Must See it.
I:8424;755;This movie makes a strong statement on how our modern mythology (comic books) comes from actual historic events, and that people with superpowers live among us.
I:8424;756;the movie is constructed very carefully, building at a very measured pace.
I:8424;757;If you are into comic books, superheroes, or the like, then this will be a wonderful movie for you.
I:8424;758;I did not enjoy it, but I can see that others might.
I:8424;759;If you ever wondered what it would be like if heroes really existed, or like Super Hero movies in general this movie is for you!
I:8424;760;Unbreakable, with excellent performances by all the main actors, is the last decent film M. Night has made.
I:8424;761;"I would argue that this is better than ""The Sixth Sense"", which is definitely good, but gets its main impact from the ending."
I:8424;762;Unbreakable, in its pacing, character interaction and mood, is a well made film and worth watching more than once.
I:8424;763;He was still good though.
I:8424;764;With very few words, he can express how he's feeling.
I:8424;765;M. Night Shyamalan delivers with another success.
I:8424;766;I think the best acting was done by Samuel L. Jackson who was the weird comic collector who was obsessed with David's supernatural powers.
I:8424;767;I liked it, and own it because anything as good and suspenseful as Unbreakable is definetely worth owning.
I:8424;768;The Sixth Sense was fantastic, but every movie since then has been a wash.
I:8424;769;it's good, buttt not the best film to watch.
I:8424;770;Now if want to see a great movie, watch this stuff.
I:8424;771;Bruce Willis is awesome in here as well.
I:8424;772;one of the best and most underrated films in 2000!
I:8424;773;Shyamalan is able to introduce complex philosophical concepts in a Philosphy for Dummies way.
I:8424;774;In this movie, Shyamalan comes off as unconfident of his abilities to tell a story and vastly underestimates the intelligence of the audience.
I:8424;775;The end was a surprise however, just not the kind that was very clever or well thought out.
I:8424;776;This is a wonderful film.
I:8424;777;m. Knight is a great writer because he forces the audience to pay attention.
I:8424;778;The little details that he adds to his films make them so fresh and entertaining.
I:8424;779;On the plus side, this movie has very good acting, and a really original idea.
I:8424;780;Also the mood and color tone of the movie is consistently moving.
I:8424;781;I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies that move faster than this one.
I:8424;782;"Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", but he outdid himself with ""Unbreakable"", a film I liked even better."
I:8424;783;This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.
I:8424;784;The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.
I:8424;785;The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.
I:8424;786;the direction is superb in every aspect.
I:8424;787;The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.
I:8424;788;The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.
I:8424;789;"As was the case with ""Sixth Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film."
I:8424;790;Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.
I:8424;791;Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.
I:8424;792;"Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"")."
I:8424;793;Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.
I:8424;794;for anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.
I:8424;795;It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.
I:8424;796;If there is one thing I love about M. Night Shamalayan's films, it is that they generally work on several levels, are thought provoking, and don't rely on generic material to tell a story.
I:8424;797;"Sure, viewers of his films now look for the ""twist"" at the conclusion (thanks to The Sixth Sense), but there is so much more to the viewing experience that we shouldn't judge a film solely on its conclusion (like many did in The Village)."
I:8424;798;Unbreakable is such a film that works on many levels, and has a symbolic, yet human aspect to it.
I:8424;799;Years later, having seen the film several times since, I have a love and appreciation for this film and its depth.
I:8424;800;The film itself works as a sort of comic book story told in human form.
I:8424;801;unbreakable incorporates an understated level within its telling, but it is masterful in building both a symbolic and literal level of storytelling.
I:8424;802;"On one side is the comic book angle of good vs. evil
I:8424;803;Each of the two main characters, David and Elijah, represent these two angles.
I:8424;804;The story that is told from David's point of view brings with it a simple, but readily identifiable theme: we each have a gift, and we need to use it for the common good.
I:8424;805;One aspect of Unbreakable is really just David finding his identify and existence in the world.
I:8424;806;The scenery, visuals, colors all enhance the experience of watching as well.
I:8424;807;Everytime I review a movie I can almost always come up with one of two conclusions.
I:8424;808;which is relatively rare and in which case a movie can be characterized as a masterpiece and I feel in my heart that I have to give it five stars .
I:8424;809;Unbreakable belongs to the second category.
I:8424;810;The idea is great, the plot entertaining and original, the cast proper, the characters round and fairly developed.
I:8424;811;We can sense that Shyamalan has a burning desire to make the movie sound interesting and deep.
I:8424;812;Whereas in the Sixth Sense, I felt a true depth and entertainment.
I:8424;813;i mostly have this sensation that Night Shyamalan could have created so much more, could have made a much more entertaining movie.
I:8424;814;Nonetheless, I have to give credit to Shyamalan for the very original twisted ending of this film.
I:8424;815;Gives just enough shock, and leaves just enough unknown to allow a sequel to be produced.
I:8424;816;If it is indeed, I certainly hope the matter will be deeper and richer than Unbreakable 's.
I:8424;817;As a tribute to the comic medium as a way to tell stories/myths that has origins all the way back to the first civilisations e. g. Egyptian stone carvings etc this film will appeal more to lovers of comics and their collectors as they try to justify their addiction to and continued spending on them.
I:8424;818;This Vista Series version is interesting as it comes in 2 discs with some special features such as a documentary about comics and some trailers and a making of film although overall nothing much to shout about.
I:8424;819;moving but entertaining for those with some patience although certainly not something to rave about.
I:8424;820;It's slow, but the pace makes it all the more realistic and engaging.
I:8424;821;Great story and acting, it's just good.
I:8424;822;This is, most certainly, a peculiar film.
I:8424;823;But when you finally arrive at the ending, after a long journey, everything will suddenly become clear to you, and the film will seem brilliant in retrospect.
I:8424;824;I did, at least: I rate this as one of the coolest endings since THE USUAL SUSPECTS.
I:8424;825;Other than this, the film features nice visuals and good acting.
I:8424;826;The edges are clean and razor sharp, solor and contrast are so spot on, the SD version looks like VHS.
I:8424;827;Nevertheless, the sound is terrific.
I:8424;828;Plenty of LFE invovement and great ambient surrounds.
I:8424;829;This is another terrific release from Sony.
I:8424;830;I recently watched his last 4 movies, and he's got a very good record, with 2 brilliant films (this and 'Signs'), a very good one ('The Sixth Sense') and a good one.
I:8424;831;Though I think that I like 'Signs' best as of this moment it's a tough call, and 'Unbreakable' is, in many ways, his most impressive film.
I:8424;832;Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about it is just that it works at all: The whole 'maybe super heroes are real and the comics are just an exaggeration' angle just sounded really stupid to me, but he makes it very dramatic and dark, and creates a world that is impossible not to believe in.
I:8424;833;(Dunn never seems to get hurt or sick, has an intuitive knowledge as to who may be dangerous and is just extraordinarily strong etc.) The rest of the film is basically their exploration of the possibility, and a look into Dunn's family life.
I:8424;834;driven film, but I think he pulls it off well enough.
I:8424;835;We only get to know him very slowly as the film move along, but I definitely liked the guy by the end.
I:8424;836;Robin Wright Penn is good as his wife Audrey, and she's a bit more emotional and adds some warmth to the film.
I:8424;837;Spencer Clark is fine as their son Joseph, though he's most significant as a plot device as he's particularly intrigued by the concept that David may be a hero, and rather forces the issue at a few points.
I:8424;838;I suppose I can understand why people will dislike this sorta thing, but this is precisely what I like most about them, and what allows them to really have a strong impact.
I:8424;839;But that scene really draws you into the film, and really makes you feel the impact of the train crash despite the fact that you never actually see it.
I:8424;840;There are plenty of extraordinary things going on in this film, and you need to get immersed in the world slowly for it to really hold on to you.
I:8424;841;That and it just looks great with fine use of the widescreen format.
I:8424;842;These long takes allow for each scene to be composed very deliberately and it's all very sharp and elegant with lot cool blues everywhere.
I:8424;843;All of Shyamalan's films have fantastic cinematography but this is probably the best of them.
I:8424;844;`Unbreakable' comes to a really extraordinary climax.
I:8424;845;It is an action scene, more or less, but it's a beautiful culmination of all the build up in the film.
I:8424;846;It finds the perfect balance between the cool elegance of the visual style of the movie as a whole and the unglamorous, brute nature of the violence found here.
I:8424;847;lots of people have complained about the ending, but what can I say, I liked it.
I:8424;848;It's a bit much, I'll admit, but it's really very clever, I think.
I:8424;849;Also, they talk about how Dunn won the rookie of the year trophy, yet he never played professional football, only college.
I:8424;850;I know I did.Yeah, this is a great film.
I:8424;851;I enjoyed this film, and while the comparisons with The Sixth Sense are inevitable, this one should be considered on it's own merits.
I:8424;852;A good story, good acting and beatifully filmed, the director's attention to detail will become legendary.
I:8424;853;Note the use of colors, the subtle interconnections of seemingly unrelated people/situations, and the precise pacing.
I:8424;854;The film bears up well with repeated viewings, and the extras provided are succinct, and add to one's appreciation of the writer/director's vision.
I:8424;855;Leave the comic book scene to Kevin Smith.
I:8424;856;The more I think about it, the more I like it.
I:8424;857;The more you use your imagination, the more you'll like it.
I:8424;858;This one has to be seen.
I:8424;859;It's suspenseful, has good acting, cool camera angles and the story is so unique.
I:8424;860;Samuel L. Jackson's character Elijah is mesmerizing.
I:8424;861;Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan puts the art of story telling and creative plots back into movies.
I:8424;862;The plot itself is interesting and kept me watching, but as the movie progressed it got dumber and dumber.
I:8424;863;other dead ends are with Samuel L. Jackson character who is nuts, but you wonder how he found Willis' and how he knew he had this special gift.
I:8424;864;Bruce Willis returns for the role of the quiet, laid.
I:8424;865;back lead and shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson`s enigmatic presence.
I:8424;866;Like the Sixth Sense , Unbreakable also tells a mysterious slow paced story where and adult man has deep connections with a kid, but this time the plot is more interesting and original.
I:8424;867;The direction is terrific and certainly helps to create an absorbing and gripping mood and atmosphere, even if some scenes are too slow and unengaging.
I:8424;868;The score is adequate as well, as is the convincing and subtle acting.
I:8424;869;And the ending is a bit anti.
I:8424;870;Still, for the most part Unbreakable works pretty well and suceeds as a very well.
I:8424;871;crafted and unusual story worth discovering.
I:8424;872;It`s also refreshing to watch a superhero that`s so distant from most of the cliches that are common within the genre.
I:8424;873;not a classic, just a good effort.
I:8424;874;Going into Unbreakable I wasn't sure how a good movie could be made about a real life superhero .
I:8424;875;He accomplishes this by completely avoiding a comic book feel.
I:8424;876;In every comic you or I have read since age 5, the super hero discovers their powers, instantly accepts them, and gets on about the business of saving the world.
I:8424;877;Shyamalan allows us to see the world through Willis eyes as he slowly realizes that Jackson is right and tries to deal with what it means to be a superhero .
I:8424;878;the movie is shot in the same fashion as the sixth sense: with great use of shadow and unconventional camera angles.
I:8424;879;This style does wonders for the suspense of the film.
I:8424;880;But even on its own, this movie is well worth watching.
I:8424;881;life crisis and a son that idolizes his every move.
I:8424;882;"Elijah has a rare genetic bone disease that makes his bones very susceptible to breakage, thus giving him the childhood nick name of ""Mr. Glass."""
I:8424;883;He believes that the world is essentially one big comic.
I:8424;884;For all those who are frail and defenseless, there are just as many of those who are essentially the hero of a comic book: strong, invincible and superhumanin their abilities.
I:8424;885;There is, however, plenty to be said of M. Night Shyamalan.
I:8424;886;In his sophomore thriller/suspense story, he fine tunes his craft with more confidence than was displayed in The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;887;But as history tells it, his audiences did get it and now he has us wrapped around his finger.
I:8424;888;This truly is Shyamalan's show and he does an excellent job of tricking the audience and their emotions, much like he did with Sense.
I:8424;889;"I like to compare Shyamalan to a really good magician
I:8424;890;Show us the quarter, wave it in front of us, move one hand over the other, add a flick of the wrist and `poof!'
I:8424;891;This is where Shyamalan's gift lies.
I:8424;892;"This is a film about the inevitability of fate and destiny
I:8424;893;This film in it's purest form is essentially a wonderfully crafted slight.
I:8424;894;Although I do give him credit, because he can act extremely well.
I:8424;895;In the opening minutes, the camerawork involved got me worked up, and anticipating what was to come.
I:8424;896;the thing that made me love this so damn much was the entire movie was like the first act of a regular superhero movie.
I:8424;897;The ending is one of the best I've seen in a while, and Willis and Shyamalan are thinking about making a trilogy.
I:8424;898;That would make it a perfect package.
I:8424;899;The transfer is beautiful(the colors are brought out magnificently), and the audio is just as lovable.
I:8424;900;I loved the score to the film.
I:8424;901;On the second disc are a few fun, informative featurettes that could have been a little bit longer.
I:8424;902;Lastly, there's a hilarious bit in which M. Night Shyamalan includes another one of his extremely funny kid films .
I:8424;903;The sound effects and acting pretty much sum up what I'm talking about.
I:8424;904;If your a fan of thrillers, this is definitely up your alley, and go into it more open.
I:8424;905;You'll enjoy it much more that way.
I:8424;906;Bruce Willis is led to discover and accept something strange about himself .
I:8424;907;you will want to cheer him when he puts it to work.
I:8424;908;son relationship in some very touching scenes.
I:8424;909;Unbreakable is quiet and moody.
I:8424;910;I liked this, but more than that I loved the story, which is about self.
I:8424;911;It was something I could relate to my own life and experience.
I:8424;912;"I also like the way he depicts husbands and wives
I:8424;913;The director is very special in that he has the ability to create a plot so grand that it bears hard on the imagination, yet he keeps his characters subtle and ordinary.
I:8424;914;This is a good balance.
I:8424;915;This is a realistic comic book story.
I:8424;916;"Unbreakable came out in ""2000"" and it had the best trailer for any M. n. s film ever."
I:8424;917;"I thought ""The Village"" prompted this need in me."
I:8424;918;My subject is one of the reasons I write a review.
I:8424;919;I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis lift weight in the film and play the role of a superman while doing it.
I:8424;920;Lack of suspense and surprises.4.
I:8424;921;Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) survives a train.
I:8424;922;Afterwards, he finds himself dogged by a brittle.
I:8424;923;boned stranger (Samuel L. Jackson), who claims that Dunn is a comic book superhero come to life.
I:8424;924;up to his classic, THE SIXTH SENSE, and it doesn't disappoint.
I:8424;925;Full of characterization and mood, Shyamalan and his cast weave an absorbing tale that provides a unique look in the world of superheroes.
I:8424;926;Willis and Jackson are both solid in their roles.
I:8424;927;books with Jackson and some of today's hottest comic.
I:8424;928;While this film is not in the same league as THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE provides solid, suspenseful entertainment.
I:8424;929;He meets an intense, strange, brittle.
I:8424;930;the dependable Bruce Willis invests his role with his trademark, career.
I:8424;931;making everyday man persona and brings home a sense that, yes, this is how a Regular Joe would react to such unusual circumstances.
I:8424;932;I always relish when he takes the minimalist road as his acting choice (though his mouthy and brash Moonlighting and Blind Date persona is also fun).
I:8424;933;Samuel Jackson's assured Elijah provides a very good foil for Willis's stoic David.
I:8424;934;Robin Wright Penn's character is nicely miserable but hopeful and should've been more involved in the proceedings.
I:8424;935;to symbolize and convey the innocence and wonder of the comic book theme .
I:8424;936;off with a worthy supervillain.
I:8424;937;Shyamalan is earnest in his writing and directing effort but *sigh* I wish he'd found a happy medium between his original concept and the version with which he ended.
I:8424;938;He shoots for the grandiose moments and almost, almost gets there.
I:8424;939;Still, I admire his sincerity and great effort and I was entertained enough to recommend this film: 3 and a half stars.
I:8424;940;Additional scenes with an intro by M. Night.
I:8424;941;"depth ""Behind the Scenes"" feature."
I:8424;942;a fascinating feature delving into the superhero/comic book mythos with avid fan Sam Jackson, the great Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, Alex Ross, Denny O'Neil, Michael Chabon and Frank Miller (Eisner talks about the origin of his Spirit hero).
I:8424;943;angled feature on the train station sequence.
I:8424;944;an amusing early film endeavor of a younger M. Night in a fight scene with two kids.
I:8424;945;this movie is absolutely amazing and not just a panorama of special effects and cliches.
I:8424;946;types and what it means to be a hero in our modern world.
I:8424;947;The twist at the end had to be one of the best twists I have ever seen in a movie, mostly because it made such perfect sense.
I:8424;948;it's not often that a movie of such complexity and intelligence is made.
I:8424;949;Unbreakable, simply put, is the best PG.13 movie that I have ever seen.
I:8424;950;the first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago right after watching the sixth sense.
I:8424;951;Because R movies are realistic, and it's there that I can find the powerful dramas and the eye popping action movies.
I:8424;952;It is a powerful movie, with excellent acting, and a fantastic ending.
I:8424;953;The plot is remarquable and finally something original.
I:8424;954;I found the movie to be very well made, with wonderful directing and writing.
I:8424;955;The actors are all connected and are great together.
I:8424;956;As for the plot, wow, it's amazing.
I:8424;957;The movie is about a man played by Bruce Willis that survives a horrific train crash.
I:8424;958;Meet Elijah played by the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson who does as usual an excellent job.
I:8424;959;He is an avid comic book collector and when he hears of the crash and one survivor, he knows that he is a superhero.
I:8424;960;Right?Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and has great chemistry with Bruce Willis.
I:8424;961;And you want action, right?
I:8424;962;The movie had a very good moral and had a deeper meaning I found to be very intersting.
I:8424;963;this trully is a wonderful and compelling movie that I adore.
I:8424;964;it was perhaps inevitable that 'Unbreakable' would be billed as another suspense thriller after the huge success of 'The Sixth Sense'.
I:8424;965;moving character study that deals with themes such as heroism and the fortunes of fate.
I:8424;966;"'Unbreakable' has a fascinating premise derived from the ""superhero"" themes of comic books."
I:8424;967;bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are best known for playing wisecracking larger.
I:8424;968;stated performances here that suit both the film and their characters.
I:8424;969;There is a typical Shyamalan twist ending, but even this is more powerful as a character revelation than as a device to further the plot.
I:8424;970;But if you are prepared to be patient and put some thought into it, `Unbreakable' is an excellent, under.
I:8424;971;rated, and unique film that will reward your efforts.
I:8424;972;The comic book slant is woven throughout the film.
I:8424;973;It's exciting to see a movie that is crafted, not just a story told.
I:8424;974;but the twist makes the whole entire movie come together and that's whan you realize it's a brilliantly written movie.
I:8424;975;You don't know what it is, and believe me it's worth seeing.
I:8424;976;This is a great, in.
I:8424;977;"To make a good comparison, most people listen to pop music nowadays because it's a loud, fast, easy to follow medium
I:8424;978;But, if you understand and enjoy the use of camera techniques, colors, sound, foreshadowing and juxtaposition as significant story telling devices you should see what this movie is about.
I:8424;979;Examples are David Dunn's alliterative name like most super hero comic book characters (Peter Parker, Reed Richards, Bruce Banner), the way scenes are framed, a believable origin story, explanation of the art of comic books, and how villains and super heroes are often friends (Magneto and Xavier).
I:8424;980;this one has a surprise ending.
I:8424;981;Several great twists and turns to keep it interesting.
I:8424;982;Willis is a fantastic humble hero .
I:8424;983;where has all the humility gone?Anyhow, loved the very believable inside look at modern day super heroes and villains.
I:8424;984;all in all a great movie!
I:8424;985;It's been proven time and time again that this day in cinema the suprise is, you usually love the movies you'd thought you'd hate and you usually hate the movies you'd thought you'd love.
I:8424;986;Maybe it's the high hopes of being a true film fan that sparks these mixed feelings.
I:8424;987;As a movie fan you await to be apart of something.
I:8424;988;Ways in which one can learn, laugh, and cry completely vicariously through characters who we relate to, sympathize with, and at times pity.
I:8424;989;well, this film called The Sixth Sense was what Hollywood called a sleeper hit.
I:8424;990;But M. Night Shyamalan has a gift for storytelling and definitely story crafting.
I:8424;991;He makes us hold onto these mysterious characters even if we have no idea where we're being taken too.
I:8424;992;That was the beauty of the Sixth Sense.
I:8424;993;Unbreakable is a beautiful concept film.
I:8424;994;It has these strong ideas, nurtured into a screenplay.
I:8424;995;It's ideas and concepts on balance in the universe, opposition, purpose, and the nature of what is good and evil.
I:8424;996;It wasn't great, it was simply good.
I:8424;997;Slow, visual style that captures the feel of comic book frames throughout entire film.
I:8424;998;One of Bruce's most subtle and engaging roles.
I:8424;999;burn of a superhero movie.
I:8424;1000;I wish the director had stuck with such intimate family portrayals like this one and Sixth Sense
I:8424;1001;Great movie and was enhanced by the blu.
I:8424;1002;i am not a big Bruce Willis fan but he did a great job in this movie.
I:8424;1003;I have to admit I am a big fan of M Nigh Shyamalan but this actually my 2nd favorite of his films (I really love Signs).
I:8424;1004;The depth of imagery and story astounds me.
I:8424;1005;night has a great use of color and dialogue in this film.
I:8424;1006;He is able, once again, to create a very real universe with very plausible (yet fantastic) characters.
I:8424;1007;If you enjoyed Night's more dramatic films like the Village I think you should give this a try.
I:8424;1008;I would also suggest it for anyone who is a big fan of Bruce Willis and/or Samuel Jackson because their performances are wonderful.
I:8424;1009;if so, this movie is definitely for you.
I:8424;1010;what's so impressive about this movie is how we are made to understand the mental dilemmas of the main character, we feel him learning to accept that his powers are real, and just becasue he has them doesn't mean he has to be an unfalliable superhero .
I:8424;1011;however, don't assume that because you loved 6th sense, you'll love this movie.
I:8424;1012;this appealed to a large audience, and especially helped to attract a female following.
I:8424;1013;overall, i personally loved this movie.
I:8424;1014;i do indeed recommend this movie.
I:8424;1015;I liked this movie better than Shyamalan's last flick, The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1016;Bruce Willis, gives a great performance, and Sam Jackson does well.
I:8424;1017;THe extras are great, specifically the deleted scenes.
I:8424;1018;The sound is incredible, I hope you got 5.1.
I:8424;1019;The color is so crisp and rich.
I:8424;1020;This is an amazing film to use in the classroom.
I:8424;1021;I like Samuel L. Jackson films normally, and he is good in this, but it isn't one of his better films.
I:8424;1022;interesting and far fetched, as for the twist, well, its not too bad, but nothing surprising.
I:8424;1023;Movies such as the X. men have helped to bring this about, but M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is the best example of the superhero in the modern day.
I:8424;1024;The movie is brilliant and raises as many questions as it answers throughout its run .
I:8424;1025;Shyamalan's ethereal feel and use of color as symbolism throughout is well.
I:8424;1026;placed but not obvious, and the interplay between a skeptical yet unhappy Willis and the driven but fragile Jackson is a surprising meld of acting styles that delivers a fantastic human element to the visual masterpiece.
I:8424;1027;based movies and the discovery of true potential, you will enjoy this movie.
I:8424;1028;View this movie with an open mind and on it's own merits and you will be thoroughly entertained.
I:8424;1029;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson act their hearts out.
I:8424;1030;The story really gets you involved.
I:8424;1031;I expected a better movie with Samuel L. Jackson in it.
I:8424;1032;The relationship between Willis' character and his son's was realistic in the way that the director portrayed the desperation with which the son clings to his father(Willis).
I:8424;1033;Samuel L. Jackson plays his character with all the seriousness and flair in which he is famous for.
I:8424;1034;The way Willis' character discovers and uses his newfound super.
I:8424;1035;hero's gift is a heart.
I:8424;1036;"stopping scene
I:8424;1037;What I found to be completely mind.
I:8424;1038;blowing was the ending, which ties everything together and gives the explanation for the rest of the story.
I:8424;1039;It was a perfect ending!!
I:8424;1040;This is definitely a MUST.
I:8424;1041;UNBREAKABLE is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the hero archetype.
I:8424;1042;ray pays off here in spades, thanks to all the subtle hints and superb details that the filmmakers included.
I:8424;1043;Some scenes are a little soft that should be crisp, like a couple close.
I:8424;1044;ups on faces, but this is largely a nice transfer.
I:8424;1045;there's no commentary track but the special features are excellent: behind the scenes, comic book mini.
I:8424;1046;Skillfully done, this is an enjoyable BD.
I:8424;1047;What is so intriguing about Unbreakable is the examination of the archetypal elements of comic book superheroes and villains.
I:8424;1048;samuel L. Jackson, an incredible actor, plays a comic book connoisseur with a congenital disease that leaves him with brittle bones that shatter like glass.
I:8424;1049;He believes that somewhere there must exist his opposite.
I:8424;1050;The ending is surprising and the movie is thought provoking.
I:8424;1051;"i love mystical themes in movies, and this film examines how far archetypal roles stretch out into ""reality"", if there is indeed a ""flip side"" to every person and extreme, and an unusual examination of ""evil"" and ""good""."
I:8424;1052;I have become a fan of film director M. Night Shyamalan.
I:8424;1053;"While not in the same class as a director as some of my other favorite directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg or Akira Kurosawa Shyamalan still has provided some great suspenseful and thought provoking films like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""The Happening"" among others."
I:8424;1054;Unbreakable is another example of just how good Shyamalan can be as a movie director.
I:8424;1055;A clever story line with great actors in the lead parts and a another one of those unexpected plot twists at the end of the film that you won't see coming.
I:8424;1056;One who's name is Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who from birth has a rare bone disorder that leaves them very fragile.
I:8424;1057;The day he was born Elijah had both his arms and legs broken.
I:8424;1058;Elijah developes a love for comic books with a belief that superhero's live among us.
I:8424;1059;Price is convinced Dunn is one of those superhero's who live among us and approaches Dunn about this.
I:8424;1060;Dunn slowly comes to believe that maybe there is something to this super hero stuff and with Elijah's help tried to develop his powers.
I:8424;1061;the story is compelling and you can easily get caught up in the characters lives and whether Dunn is indeed a superhero.
I:8424;1062;In fact it can keep you on your toes as incidents occur and things are said in passing that come back later in the movie to have relevance to the story.
I:8424;1063;It forces you to tune in to what is happening as well a guessing what will happen next.
I:8424;1064;"Like many others I rate ""Unbreakable"" as one of his best movies Shyamalan has even done."
I:8424;1065;The movie Unbreakable is going to be a classic, with a superb cast (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn).
I:8424;1066;Its a really refreshing movie, that leaves out all the usual cliches, and a real abnormal plot.
I:8424;1067;The stranger is persisten in decribing to David that he is a super.
I:8424;1068;But I still found it interesting.
I:8424;1069;"i enjoyed watching Willis' character beginning to bond with his wife and child again
I:8424;1070;discovery and forms a bond with the compelling and successful Elijah.
I:8424;1071;i love this movie and have seen it four times.
I:8424;1072;After the first time, I absorbed all of the extra's.
I:8424;1073;Night is a great writer/director and manages not only to write compelling scripts, but also to film the scenes in a way that pulls you into the film.
I:8424;1074;His use of color is that of an artist, telling its own story.
I:8424;1075;My first impression of this movie is how incredibly well Night Shyamalan can create a scene through lighting, sound and angles.
I:8424;1076;This worked incredibly well in the acclaimed The Sixth Sense and worked well with Bruce Willis' bland, subdued delivery.
I:8424;1077;It puts the characters into a very real context and painstakingly manufactures our belief in the characters.
I:8424;1078;something we've seen in every good role he's had from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars.
I:8424;1079;a very cool character misused and too easily dismissed from the story.
I:8424;1080;The documentaries included will thrill comic book readers who dig that sort of conversation and gives audiences an appeal to understand the film better if they watch a second time.
I:8424;1081;Once you've seen Unbreakable and you understand the ending, it all comes to you in a single solitary flash: so simple, yet so satisfying.
I:8424;1082;Bruce Willis turns in some good underacting as the hero David Dunn who has been at conflict with his true identity his entire life.
I:8424;1083;Samuel L. Jackson plays a disabled comic art dealer with a more than unusual world outlook.
I:8424;1084;The ending is quite a surprise and well worth the build up.
I:8424;1085;This movie was so great, where to start?
I:8424;1086;But then the director took this remarkably fresh take on that worn out concept.
I:8424;1087;Well, that is exactly what he has done again with Unbreakable.
I:8424;1088;If you look at it in this light, I think the film has a much greater impact.
I:8424;1089;I love this movie and is one of my favorites.
I:8424;1090;"I love the slow pacing and the thought of a ""superhero"" story set in the real world."
I:8424;1091;A real story with real world sensibilities and pacing.
I:8424;1092;True thoughts and action as a real person trying to understand that he might be extraordinary.
I:8424;1093;The main character's young son being the one to push his father to believe in that possibility of something that seems to an adult mind as impossible.
I:8424;1094;I Love the character that Bruce Willis plays, he a normal guy that fell into those cracks of getting caught up in a dead end job, loosing passion for his relationship and his life in general, something I myself and others can relate to.
I:8424;1095;Being presented something more, the idea your life has more meaning and getting obsessed with knowing the truth, is there more to my life then this.
I:8424;1096;the Character that Samuel L. Jackson is one of his best roles in recent memory.
I:8424;1097;M. Night takes tradition comic book ideas and situations and transforms them for the real world but it's still just like a comic book heroes origin story.
I:8424;1098;i love comic books and super heroes, but here is a hero that is strong but not lifting cars, indestructible but not having bullets bounce off his eye ball, more of a real world superhero.
I:8424;1099;i also love the cinematography and the subtle pallet changes.
I:8424;1100;Just look at the restaurant scene 3/4 the way in the movie, there is emotion and passion starting to drive these characters again and the walls of the restaurant is full of color, the clothes are more colorful compared to these same characters at the beginning of the film, they have nothing but dull clothes and surroundings, just like there emotional state.
I:8424;1101;look at it the first time he has it on and compare it to the last.
I:8424;1102;All these small elements help the emotion and heightened the senses of the viewer without the viewer even knowing it.
I:8424;1103;These things are small and it's easy to over due and hit you in the face with it, M. night tried to go with the less is more approach that flows though out this film and stays true to the story, this movie is not batman nor is it the Matrix it is a true film with something to say.
I:8424;1104;"By the end of the movie you see, the Mother, Father, Child and Father's Friend all have there emotional ""awakening"" and show some true passion for what is real."
I:8424;1105;The way it is shot is contrary from every other film that is shot today.
I:8424;1106;Most movies today have so many cuts to keep the ADD audience from getting bored, but this movie has the confidence in that the characters and story will keep you engrossed.
I:8424;1107;You live and die by it i guess but I really cared what happened in his Marriage, with his son and his budding relationship with Elijah.
I:8424;1108;It took artistic restraint and discipline to end the movie in the fashion that it did.
I:8424;1109;it makes it true to the message of the story.
I:8424;1110;Most movies have this story in the first act, how cool to explore just this part of a hero story.
I:8424;1111;The mixture of gritty realism with the notion that a man can be born with super powers may seem like oil and water to those who've never heard of Watchmen or The Dark Knight Returns.
I:8424;1112;In fact, I think it was one of Jackson's best perfomances, and one of the top five of the year.
I:8424;1113;Granted, the pacing can be a little slow at times, but I never said the movie is perfect.
I:8424;1114;from a technical standpoint, Night does an incredible job.
I:8424;1115;His bizarre perspective's and subtle use of color and sound are extraordinary.
I:8424;1116;The performances, while understated (excluding Mr. Glass of course) are very genuine.
I:8424;1117;I also enjoyed the 20 minute feature on super.
I:8424;1118;It was awesome to see Will Eisner, Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons talk shop in a documentary format.
I:8424;1119;So, while the movie isn't perfect, it's definitely worth seeing.
I:8424;1120;If you can't get into the whole comic book angle, maybe you can relate to the ultimate theme of the story: finding your place in the world.
I:8424;1121;While this may not be a traditional story of good and evil, it is a story of a single man's potential, for good or ill.
I:8424;1122;Before the superhero genre became really popular with X. men, Spiderman, Hulk and Daredevil, Unbreakable slipped onto the scene with a truly fascinating look at the possibility of Superheroes and comic books being a form of modern mythology.
I:8424;1123;With this statement we are intrigued.
I:8424;1124;He lays out everything with dead on seriousness and conviction.
I:8424;1125;Shyamalan smartly tones it down in order to keep us on board.
I:8424;1126;He finds that as he works out, he can add more and more weight to the bench press.
I:8424;1127;He struggles a bit, but eventually manages to lift over 900 pounds.
I:8424;1128;this kind of realistic discovery about himself and the enlightenment of his own abilities starts to change his own life.
I:8424;1129;The dichotomy of his character and Elijah truly comes to a head in the finale.
I:8424;1130;This movie is slow paced thriller, with a dramatic story and a twist that is worthy of the Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1131;Highly recommended, a great movie.
I:8424;1132;ending battle between good and evil, the dependance of good and evil upon each other in order to exist, weaknesses, and about fulfilling one's true destiny.
I:8424;1133;Extras include an interview with Night Shyamalan, who is as articulate in front of the camera as behind it, and a series of shots you can see (and switch back and forth between) as storyboard and as the finished product.
I:8424;1134;"director M. Night Shyamalan stunned us with ""The 6th Sense"" and tops himself with ""Unbreakable""."
I:8424;1135;I thought it was a great movie when I first saw it, but upon seeing it 18 months later I think it is a masterpiece.
I:8424;1136;Shyamalan's introductions to the deleted scenes are very insightful.
I:8424;1137;I love seeing and hearing an artist talk about his work especially someone as smart as he is.
I:8424;1138;The scenes themselves are astonishing.
I:8424;1139;The scene with the priest and the flashback in the carnival are 2 of the best things he has ever created.
I:8424;1140;I was really happy to see Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons included in it.
I:8424;1141;"The ""making of"" piece is very cool."
I:8424;1142;A lot of thought and effort went into this disc and it pays off.
I:8424;1143;This a a great disc.
I:8424;1144;provoking film I have ever seen.
I:8424;1145;just watch it and enjoy the wonder that is UNBREAKABLE!!!
I:8424;1146;Well, personally, (and please do bear in mind that this is only what I think!)
I:8424;1147;I think the director and writer has done a superb job with this movie.
I:8424;1148;The gradual awakening of David to his unbreakable abilities keeps you gripped to the edge of your seat.
I:8424;1149;the doubts he has of his own abilities are one of the best parts of the film.
I:8424;1150;The movie leaves you wanting more .
I:8424;1151;Bruce Willis is perfect for this role.
I:8424;1152;"time Academy Award nominee ""The Sixth Sense"" last year, has written and directed yet another praiseworthy film in ""Unbreakable."""
I:8424;1153;The film stars veteran actors Bruce Willis as modern day superhero David Dunn and Samuel L. Jackson as comic book collector Elijah Price.
I:8424;1154;Unbreakable is a film about two men, who have lived their years at opposite ends of life's spectrum.
I:8424;1155;What follows is the personal journey of the film's protagonist, David Dunn, as he discovers, through the help of Elijah Price, that even the most ordinary of men is capable of the extraordinary.
I:8424;1156;as Dunn and his wife, Audrey, are given a second chance at love, and the relationship between David and his doting son, Joseph, is explored.
I:8424;1157;dunn's superhuman strength, for example, and a flashback to a college car accident that Dunn and his now.
I:8424;1158;Samuel L. Jackson also delivers a stellar performance as Elijah Price, as he helps Willis's character, David Dunn, discover himself, while he himself realizes who he truly is.
I:8424;1159;"This movie won't surprise you in the same way that The Sixth Sense"" did, but it will surprise you (in an ""Oh!"
I:8424;1160;"M. Night Shyamalan has delivered audiences another treat in ""Unbreakable."""
I:8424;1161;It took Bruce Willis an hour and eighteen minutes to even entertain the idea that he had special powers, when the viewer knew it from square one.
I:8424;1162;Knowing that this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie, viewers can expect a big twist of a pay.
I:8424;1163;off at the end of the movie, and Shyamalan doesn't disappoint.
I:8424;1164;"In ""Unbreakable"" Bruce plays an everyday man David Dunn who has extraordinary powers."
I:8424;1165;Bruce Willis was especially believable during the scene with the gun.
I:8424;1166;There was so much passion in his voice.
I:8424;1167;And that's why this role was so perfect for Bruce because he was able to channel his natural abilities of drama and even action to give such power and credence to an everyday man who happens to be everyone's hero.
I:8424;1168;There is a plot twist that will really catch you for a loop, I can't imagine anyone would expect it.
I:8424;1169;This is a wonderful movie because it's both uplifting and empowering and shows that heroes or angels or whatever you want to call them walk among us.
I:8424;1170;, dramas with a twist ending or just excellent movies that you can be proud to share with your entire family than this movie is for you.
I:8424;1171;One of my friends loved this movie, another completely hated it.
I:8424;1172;I remember being somewhere in the middle after seeing it in the theater.
I:8424;1173;setting 'I see dead people' thing, so Willis and Shylaman hooked up again for this project .
I:8424;1174;That said, it helps if you like comic books and believe in heros, and can stand a whinny Robin Wright and a militant Afro.
I:8424;1175;If you are unfamiliar with the material and just want a good movie, you will find one .
I:8424;1176;I guess he must of avoided touching people his whole life or something.
I:8424;1177;Even though Willis plays a dope, he still gives a fantastic performance.
I:8424;1178;The scene where both he and his son want to see just how strong he is and keep on adding more and more weight for him to lift is just great.
I:8424;1179;Speaking of his son, they have very good chemistry together.
I:8424;1180;There's a scene where the son wants to prove to the father that he can't be killed and has a gun pointed at him is very emotional and heartfelt.
I:8424;1181;One of the movie's more powerful scenes.
I:8424;1182;The film has one cool heroic scene, though, where Willis attempts to save a family that are a hostage in their own home.
I:8424;1183;The ending of the movie is very satisfying, even if the text explaining everything is disappointing.
I:8424;1184;David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a security Guard that has a special gift that he has had since birth.
I:8424;1185;He is invulnerable and invincible.
I:8424;1186;He cannot be harmed and he has super human strength.
I:8424;1187;His super human talents continue to increase and he basically is a super hero style character like in a comic book story.
I:8424;1188;It also shows how one man can be a hero while others are evil!
I:8424;1189;He also appeared briefly in the film.
I:8424;1190;He takes the time to develop the characters in the story and you get to understand their personalities.
I:8424;1191;this is an excellent story and movie and Bruce Willis always does a good job in a motion picture and he succeeded in this one of putting forth a good performance.
I:8424;1192;I enjoyed this film and I believe you will like it too.
I:8424;1193;Shyamalan utilizes the same technique that he did in The Sixth Sense to create an adventure that doesn't exactly have to be grandeur or epic to be thrilling and captivating.
I:8424;1194;all of the creative aspects are great .
I:8424;1195;The story is about the suspense leading up to the discovery of the truth .
I:8424;1196;if you are a fan of well.
I:8424;1197;crafted drama/suspense movies, or possibly courtroom thrillers, and you don't mind a plot that can be a bit far.
I:8424;1198;fetched, then you'll most likely enjoy this movie.
I:8424;1199;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8424;1200;I loved the acting and directing and the story of a normal man who finds out that he is not so normal after all.
I:8424;1201;I love stories based on real fantasy.
I:8424;1202;That is a story that is based in our time and place, but will have a supernatural twist to it.
I:8424;1203;this movie shows great emotion and human reaction to the fantastic.
I:8424;1204;It was a fantastic thriller that kept your eyes on the screen the entire time, with a twist straight out of left field.
I:8424;1205;Bruce Willis was great as was Samuel L. Jackson, but the story was just eh .
I:8424;1206;It did have the great twist at the end that no one expects, but this was the best part of the movie for me.
I:8424;1207;Where The Sixth Sense keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes bulging, Unbreakable keeps you firmly in your seat and relaxed.
I:8424;1208;if you're really into comics and want to see the comic.
I:8424;1209;i love all of Bruce Willis' movies.
I:8424;1210;I'm already a big Bruce Willis fan, and this movie impressed me even further.
I:8424;1211;All the other reviewers listed enough information to tell you exactly what you are getting when you watch this movie.
I:8424;1212;so all I will add is that it is (1) intense, (2) entertaining, (3) intellectually stimulating, (4) spectacular!
I:8424;1213;I loved this movie, which had the slow intellectual thriller.
I:8424;1214;style of The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1215;This movie will stimulate your mind and make you think about some unusual issues, while keeping you on the edge the entire time.
I:8424;1216;The end really shocked me, and I won't get into that.
I:8424;1217;and even the most intelligent and insightful viewers won't catch onto this one!
I:8424;1218;The Sixth Sense was such a tremendous success, expectations are ridiculously high for Shyamalan's other efforts.
I:8424;1219;The idea of a whole film dedicated to a character's discovery of his extraordinary powers (as opposed to covering that ground in 10 or 15 minutes) is clever, and Shyamalan handles the premise brilliantly.
I:8424;1220;Bruce Willis again turns in a strong performance, and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as well.
I:8424;1221;"There are some powerful scenes in ""Unbreakable""."
I:8424;1222;the hospital scene is excellent, and the staircase scene proves that Shyamalan is a film student who took his lessons to heart.
I:8424;1223;Another excellent film from Shyalaman.
I:8424;1224;Look at it that way, and you will love it
I:8424;1225;I loved The 6th Sense and my entire family saw it several times.
I:8424;1226;Give this plot to Carrie and another director and you might have a decent movie.
I:8424;1227;I really liked this film and hope that this is true because the last half hour is really where it pulls you in.
I:8424;1228;The film made around [amount] million dollars and the American box office.
I:8424;1229;This is a film that I will watch multiple times.
I:8424;1230;When I saw this movie in the theater the audience began to laugh at the plot.
I:8424;1231;It's not a comedy but most people laughed at the un.
I:8424;1232;This movie really held my attention!
I:8424;1233;Reality to the characters lives was Excellent!
I:8424;1234;"Having liked ""Sixth Sense"" very much, I was hoping to see another good movie from the same director."
I:8424;1235;I like science fiction, I like movies about the supernatural, I like mysteries, and I love comic books.
I:8424;1236;I also appreciate thoughtful and thought.
I:8424;1237;This is a great movie.
I:8424;1238;There are few big bangs.
I:8424;1239;Watch this one , if you love good movies.
I:8424;1240;I have seen this movie twice now.
I:8424;1241;first with my brother and then with my best friend.
I:8424;1242;This buildup makes the climax that much more interesting.
I:8424;1243;It is the coolest sequence I've seen in a movie since the ending of The Matrix!
I:8424;1244;I would have liked to see a commentary as well as all the other features.
I:8424;1245;The extras it does have are spectacular, though.
I:8424;1246;This is a nice touch I think.
I:8424;1247;Moving on, there is also an excerpt of a film the director made when he was about ten or eleven.
I:8424;1248;For some reason, I was lead to believe that this was an alternate ending to the movie, so when I viewed it I was somewhat disappointed, but it is interesting as a view into the director's childhood.
I:8424;1249;There is also a short behind the scenes featurette, which is entertaining and informative, but you will wish it was longer.
I:8424;1250;It's not just for comic book or superhero enthusiasts, all viewers can enjoy this movie.
I:8424;1251;the movie moved along very slowly and the ending, although far fetched was resonably good.
I:8424;1252;Now I loved that this movie was based on comic.
I:8424;1253;I just saw Unbreakable for the second time, and I can honestly say it is one of my all.
I:8424;1254;Having grown up with comic books, the premise of the movie is intriguing and, in my opinion, has more depth than M. Night Shyamalan's last movie, The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1255;While I enjoyed the Sixth Sense, this movie just blows it away.
I:8424;1256;M. Night Shyamalan's ideas about comic books are very thought.
I:8424;1257;provoking and show his brilliance and creativity as a writer.
I:8424;1258;the bottom line is that everything about this movie is excellent.
I:8424;1259;There is absolutely nothing like it, and originality.
I:8424;1260;I am looking forward to following Shyamalan's career in the future, as I find his style of movie making a unique and incredible experience.
I:8424;1261;I found this movie to be AWESOME.
I:8424;1262;I love M. Night Shyamalan's work.
I:8424;1263;this movie is yet thrilling and mysterious.
I:8424;1264;It dosent compare to the Sixth Sense however. . . 6th Sense was yet thrilling, exciting, mysterious, and very very scary.
I:8424;1265;But Unbreakable is still a great and good movie that everyone should watch and enjoy.
I:8424;1266;in one word this film is thrilling.
I:8424;1267;Bruce Willis played his role to perfection and portrayed his character with a gentle fragility few actors could ever pull off I hope this movie will have finally given most of his critics food for thought when commenting on his supposed limited acting skill.
I:8424;1268;Id have to disagree with them and say he's one of the finest actors in America.
I:8424;1269;Samuel L. Jackson plays his menacing role equally perfectly with more than enough hair for everybody, check out the wig.
I:8424;1270;I loved the strength of determination in his physically fragile character.
I:8424;1271;i couldnt recommend any other flick as strongly as this one
I:8424;1272;M. Night Shyamalan is a genius.
I:8424;1273;five out of 6 billion is pretty good I am guessing.
I:8424;1274;M. Night Syamalan is one of the best storytellers of our century.
I:8424;1275;He writes, directs, and most of the time produces his movies.
I:8424;1276;But if you are into M. Shyamalan's films you will love this no matter what.
I:8424;1277;This is a compelling story about David (Bruce Willis) who is the only survivor of a massive train wreck and who is un.
I:8424;1278;But M. Night Shyamalan's work is awesome.
I:8424;1279;Everybody in the cast does an awesome job.
I:8424;1280;By James Newton Howard, who also did The Sixth Sense, is just amazing.
I:8424;1281;I love every bit of it.
I:8424;1282;THis is an awesome movie.
I:8424;1283;I love comic books and I love a good movie,but why make this movie?
I:8424;1284;i watched Shyamalan's previous film (The Sixth Sense) and found that to be a one.
I:8424;1285;you'll more than likely get into this movie.
I:8424;1286;love that movie and believe Signs to be Shyamalan's crowning achievement thus far) it is a 50/50.
I:8424;1287;this is HANDS DOWN the best film ever dealing with the topic of comics and what it means to be a hero.
I:8424;1288;This movie has all of the grat making of a superhero movie.
I:8424;1289;All in all I think this is the best film of the year and maybe the best I have ever seen.
I:8424;1290;Unbreakable is told as a comic book: A superhero learns of his powers has his weekness, his enemy.
I:8424;1291;the middle to discover his powers weekness, the end to discover the enemy.
I:8424;1292;I recommended it for fans of comic books, but not really for fans of the sixth sense.
I:8424;1293;This has to be my most favorite M night movie ever!
I:8424;1294;This film is unlike any movie I have ever viewed.
I:8424;1295;The film takes you on a journey about the lives of two men.
I:8424;1296;They come together, and each man helps the other discover who they are.
I:8424;1297;Bruce Willis, and Samuel L. Jackson are great.
I:8424;1298;It is a movie you need to see twice, to understand certain things, and catch things as well.
I:8424;1299;each frame feels like a comic book and the cool European look that Eduardo Serra provides,dark blue hues and using cool filters.
I:8424;1300;but back to the film,everything from lighting,editing,cinematography is top notch and Night is really proving himself to be the auteur here.
I:8424;1301;willis performance is fantastic as well as Sam Jackson who is the man.
I:8424;1302;also the performances from Spencer Treat Clark and Bruce Willis's wife in the movie are awesome and compelling.
I:8424;1303;just a fantastic movie and one of the most underrated masterpieces of our generation.
I:8424;1304;"Despite what some say, ""Unbreakable"" is a good, refreshingly original story."
I:8424;1305;putting for some (and it keeps me from giving this five stars) but it's still well worth the watch.
I:8424;1306;I really like:1) Great acting2) Deep charactors3) A unique storyline.
I:8424;1307;"wins conclusion
I:8424;1308;Strangely enough, it explores an area of the psyche which Dracula's story has always exploited, the wish that we all have to be something more than what we are, immortal, powerful, to find out that we have something in us that nobody else has and which makes us something more than anyone else.
I:8424;1309;The ending is totally unexpected, but it makes perfect sense.
I:8424;1310;If you have ever found yourself totally immersed in the kind of stories that classic villain vs hero comic books used to explore (and I say used because what I see now in comic books is not what I saw when I was a kid), this is a movie that you will thoroughly enjoy.
I:8424;1311;It's intriguing to know that whilst there are people who could qualify as a member of the new X. men due to their body characteristics, there are also those who are like the exact opposite.
I:8424;1312;Shyamalan comes from the post.
I:8424;1313;conscious style of film direction: that is to say, every single shot of the movie will draw undue attention to itself (so that you notice how deep and clever it is) and every single utterance of dialogue will be buffered on either side by ten seconds (so that you notice how deep and clever it is.)
I:8424;1314;provoking precursor to what's to come, by merely confirming what most of us have known for some time: that comic book collectors are incredible dorks.
I:8424;1315;"Ironically, I actually think Mr. Glass housed some of the film's greatest potential
I:8424;1316;time spelling out Shyamalan's ideas for us, displaying aptly how seriously Shyamalan himself takes them, and how deeply he wants us to be awe.
I:8424;1317;developed character in his own right whose history or motivations are of interest to us.
I:8424;1318;unbreakable is a very stylistic movie and there were occasional intimations of the potential for something good, something involving, entertaining, and interesting.
I:8424;1319;It does draw extra attention to his various film school tricks, but under the circumstances they're just dressing without a salad.
I:8424;1320;I saw this movie the day it hit my favorite cinema .
I:8424;1321;I watched this however, a) because I have seen the trailer and it looked really great, b) because I like the sixth sense.
I:8424;1322;In one of the other reviews I read that the movie was perfectly written .
I:8424;1323;I also read a lot and I am very selective when it comes to calling a book good.
I:8424;1324;What I got had me wanting to fast forward parts.
I:8424;1325;second time I ordered it.
I:8424;1326;Both actors are good actors.
I:8424;1327;but I could enjoy the special atmospher.
I:8424;1328;if you do not see the sixth sence, you can enjoy this naturally.
I:8424;1329;This film has great character development, uses unique camera shots and has such an interesting story to tell.
I:8424;1330;I rate it as one of my most favorite films and the best work from M. Night Shyamalan.
I:8424;1331;More importantly, can a heroic type of good exist without an equally strong, deep evil to fight against?
I:8424;1332;All these themes have been explored for decades by comic book writers and artists.
I:8424;1333;"And do keep your eye on the colors in each scene
I:8424;1334;This one forces you to think and it often goes rather slowly, giving the viewer a chance to fully appreciate every detail.
I:8424;1335;It is formed with beautiful cinematography and a good cast.
I:8424;1336;The fact is you expect the surprise and you know it's coming because you have seen Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1337;however, the movie has some very strong performances.
I:8424;1338;Also, Samuel L. Jackson, who I usually think is overrated, puts in an interesting performance as the fragile comic art collector Elijah Price.
I:8424;1339;aside from the acting, the movie has artistic and creative merit.
I:8424;1340;The premise and the twist at the end show real writing strength.
I:8424;1341;This along with the way the movie is shot creates a very solid outcome.
I:8424;1342;overall, the movie is solid and is a good one for a Friday night and popcorn.
I:8424;1343;This is not great, but I would still recommend it.
I:8424;1344;Unbreakable is about the mythology behind comic book superheroes and the purposes that each of us have in life.
I:8424;1345;The film opens with the birth of a baby boy with all four of his limbs broken.
I:8424;1346;Elijah believes David to be a real superhero and gradually confronts David with his theory.
I:8424;1347;Just to add, I'm of the opinion that it is an absolute pleasure to watch Willis and Jackson act in pretty much anything.
I:8424;1348;What Shyamalan has done here in retrospect, while considering the recent onslaught of big.
I:8424;1349;budget comic book movies, is create a completely unconventional yet convincing adaptation of comic book heroes' origins.
I:8424;1350;At the same time Unbreakable celebrates the mythology behind these fictional characters.
I:8424;1351;It takes a profound imagination to come up with a screenplay that gives this concept the treatment that Shyamalan has.
I:8424;1352;a friend of mine once said that the Sixth Sense was a gigantic and nearly perfect movie for absolutely everyone, while as a comic book fan Unbreakable was tailored made perfectly for him.
I:8424;1353;If you truly love comic books, Unbreakable is your film.
I:8424;1354;Nevertheless, Unbreakable is still a joy to watch and is a shining example of Shyamalan during his most inspired and generative phase.
I:8424;1355;M. Night Shyamalan is one of the geniuses of his generation.
I:8424;1356;Pay close attention!Secondly, this is a mesmerizing film that brings back memories of the Twilight Zone.
I:8424;1357;Indeed, Shyamalan strikes back with the paranormal combined with a surprise ending.
I:8424;1358;Have you noticed the new films that ape his technique.
I:8424;1359;"Shyamalan has the knack
I:8424;1360;You keep you eyes open for clues when you see the movie again.
I:8424;1361;the story is subtle, and the over.
I:8424;1362;Treat this movie like a tender plant, as you watch it grow and unfold.
I:8424;1363;That is what life is really like: we slowly come to an awareness of who we really are, what our capabilities are, and what our mission in life is.
I:8424;1364;Working at his marriage, and not vivisecting his family.
I:8424;1365;David Dunn is a noble character.
I:8424;1366;This is one of M. night's less popular films, but one of my favorites!
I:8424;1367;It's a story of love, discovery, faith, and heroism that is very moving.
I:8424;1368;If there is anyone that looooves a good and syfi story, this is the one.
I:8424;1369;Great story and it delved into the psych of the human equation so flawlessly that you never notice it until after the movie was finish and you are sitting your car going hmmm damn.
I:8424;1370;I would recommend this movie.
I:8424;1371;A good ending calls for a good movie.
I:8424;1372;M. Night Shayaman is a very good director with great potential, if only he stays away from Sixth Sense cliches.
I:8424;1373;This movie was like that, with the same suspense and same kind of eerie mood to it.
I:8424;1374;That is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the perfect 5.
I:8424;1375;"I enjoyed Sixth Sense, I mean I've seen it like 3 times, and has a very good suspenseful thriller, and M. Night Shayaman is ranked 2 on my list of suspesful directors
I:8424;1376;watch movie because the ending really unfolds the whole story for you.
I:8424;1377;Even in Whole 9 Yards where his hit man character is menacingly humorless, there is a keen if abnormal intellect at work.
I:8424;1378;comic collecting nerd with ultra.
I:8424;1379;Some of these movie makers should chat with real people sometime.)
I:8424;1380;"hard"" fans and super hero completists."
I:8424;1381;M. Night Shyamalan has directed and written a wonderful movie here.
I:8424;1382;the movie is richly filmed and beautifully crafted.
I:8424;1383;The plot works because the actors are beleavable.
I:8424;1384;The two disk set has the extra bonus of a feature about comics.
I:8424;1385;Many people, including great comic writers and artists, Frank Miller and Alex Ross, are interviewed.
I:8424;1386;The musical score is also terrific.
I:8424;1387;In the final analysis, good triumphs evil, and our hero finds peace in himself.
I:8424;1388;Further, the subplot featuring the family, ends in an exceptional way.
I:8424;1389;I found this to be very uplifting in th emessage it speaks.
I:8424;1390;It's a great story with a surprise ending.
I:8424;1391;To my surprise, the more times I watch it, the more I enjoy it.
I:8424;1392;Bruce Willis and Samual Jackson are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to natural strength.
I:8424;1393;The acting is superb, the story compelling, and the end twist is excellent.
I:8424;1394;relates to what a wonderful director once said .
I:8424;1395;that in movies, it's really all about the ending.
I:8424;1396;Here, I liked the idea for the ending, and how the story actually turns out.
I:8424;1397;And it makes a wonderful movie such as this seem rushed at the end.
I:8424;1398;It truly angered me to see that, given the connection I'd felt so far with the movie.
I:8424;1399;Doing that, know that this movie is very good.
I:8424;1400;All I can say is I have now watch Unbreakable 3 times in 2 days.
I:8424;1401;Its a really good story.
I:8424;1402;That part of the movie is great.
I:8424;1403;It kinda puts a hint of goodness in our world of sadness.
I:8424;1404;I personally will re watch it many times I am sure.
I:8424;1405;But its fine the way it is.
I:8424;1406;"And Lastly Unbreakable to me is just as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" Oh I am watching it again right now."
I:8424;1407;M. Night Shyamalan and Bruce Willis team up for the second time in this modern fairytale about an everyday superhero.
I:8424;1408;and characterbuilding, but it is a fine story with great acting, some surprising twists and even a little tension now and then.
I:8424;1409;I think they are both brilliant movies.
I:8424;1410;the film comes in a beautiful paper box containing a fold.
I:8424;1411;It contains a behind the scenes featurette, a segment about comic books, 7 interesting deleted scenes introduced by the director and the possibility to watch the great train station sequence in film.
I:8424;1412;A man suddenly becomes invulnerable like a comic.
I:8424;1413;But like most modern comic books, unlike the black.
I:8424;1414;hat ones of yore, this comic book hero has shades of gray and vulnerabilities, though his body has undergone terrifying changes.
I:8424;1415;the homage to comic books is much better done than in Kevin Smith films.
I:8424;1416;At least it captures more of the artistry rather than adolescent obsession.
I:8424;1417;up to the superb The Sixth Sense is an equally excellent film, with masterful storytelling, great acting and strong direction from Shyamalan.
I:8424;1418;David meets up with comic book guru Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who befriends him and tells him what he can accomplish with his extraordinary gift.
I:8424;1419;played as The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has again created a world with fascinating characters and bizzare events.
I:8424;1420;And like Sixth Sense, the film does throw up a shocking twist at the end which is even more unpredictable.
I:8424;1421;"Utilising the same techniques, the audience is treeted to the director's compelling world, much alike to the early Spielberg films
I:8424;1422;notch acting from Willis and Jackson makes the film's ideas work even better.
I:8424;1423;And the premise provides a series of weird events, building up to a thrilling finale.
I:8424;1424;If it has a flaw, the pace drags sometimes, but the material is handled with aplomb.
I:8424;1425;This is one of the hottest new directors around working his magic to superb effect.
I:8424;1426;the extras are really good, with comprehensive making of documentaries, some deleted scenes which add little to the film but still make for an intersting watch, and the train sequence with a natty multi.
I:8424;1427;Unbreakable is a very unique and wonderfully done silent thriller.
I:8424;1428;The cast is outstanding and the plot line is one of the most original ideas i have ever seen.
I:8424;1429;The ending of this film is outstanding totally blowing my mind.
I:8424;1430;One of M. Night Shyamalan's few good movies, Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable.
I:8424;1431;Bruce Willis is awesome and Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson haha.
I:8424;1432;Great Super hero epic, without really being a super hero movie.
I:8424;1433;Critically, yes, Bruce Willis is in it, there's a mystery, the pace is subdued, there's a kid as his costar.
I:8424;1434;I thought this movie was superbly crafted.
I:8424;1435;There's a tangible tension in plot and characterization, a mood delicately evoked that transcends the screen.
I:8424;1436;i thought the presentstion of good and evil presented in the film were excellent.
I:8424;1437;Using comic books and the intrigue that surrounds them.
I:8424;1438;mutating that into real life super hereos (and not real life as in live action like the x. men) was an inventive and well.
I:8424;1439;if you're a fan of comics or graphic novels, you must, must, must see this film.
I:8424;1440;This movie was interesting and unexpected.
I:8424;1441;The ending gets good and is shocking and expected.
I:8424;1442;lets you take a look at things in a differnt way.
I:8424;1443;Dunn, a working class joe, is a security guard, who is married and has a son.
I:8424;1444;enter Elijah Wood, wonderfully played with electrifying intensity by Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;1445;Highly intelligent, wealthy, and single, he is the antithesis of David Dunn, the man for whom he has been searching, as long as he can remember.
I:8424;1446;Well for that you will have to watch the film, which is really an allegory for a comic book interpretation of good and evil.
I:8424;1447;Unbreakable is an interesting movie.
I:8424;1448;I enjoyed watching it unfold, the alternating between tension and relaxation.
I:8424;1449;Bruce Willis gives a tightly controlled performance as a man discovering his destiny and talents.
I:8424;1450;Particularly wonderful is the performance of Spencer Treat Clark as the son who loves his father dearly.
I:8424;1451;This little boy has so much power in those soulful eyes.
I:8424;1452;You'll want to enjoy the movie if only for his performance.
I:8424;1453;I heard the director's explanation of why the nude shower scene where Bruce Willis breaks down and cries when the impact of his miraculous survival hits him was deleted, but it is such good emotional film that it will have to be put back in a future director's cut of the movie.
I:8424;1454;The early M. Night Shyamalan home movie is a hoot and very dear.
I:8424;1455;I also found Elijah's mother played by Charlayne Woodard to give a wonderful thoughtful performance as the mother with the special son.
I:8424;1456;This is a good movie, one that will keep your attention.
I:8424;1457;I found the reversal at the end surprising.
I:8424;1458;Great acting from both Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson makes this one of the best films of 2000.
I:8424;1459;M. Night Shyamalan lays out this wonderful tale of a self.
I:8424;1460;mr. Shyamalan is one of the best director/writers of the past decades.
I:8424;1461;One day, students in film school will review Night's films along side the master, A. Hitchcock.
I:8424;1462;I was pretty excited since it was coming from the same guy who created Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1463;The movie definitely had the same spookiness as the Sixth Sense with its eerie, dream.
I:8424;1464;packed thriller but the movie tends to be more of an artistic dive of a man's understanding of his abilities.
I:8424;1465;I really enjoyed the fact that even though David (Bruce Willis) has supernatural powers, he was still firmly grounded in reality where good and evil aren't clearly defined.
I:8424;1466;The twist at the end was wonderful :) And those last three lines of text that showed that this was reality and not a comic book were disappointing but added more depth to the storyline.
I:8424;1467;The movie unravels very slowly.
I:8424;1468;A very good movie in my opinion and although it's slow, it's satisfying at the end and does make you think to a certain extent.
I:8424;1469;But, take a quiet afternoon or evening when you're doing nothing and savor this one.
I:8424;1470;Watch as Bruce Willis slowly comes to the realization that there is something special about him.
I:8424;1471;Samuel L. Jackson is his opposite number, a comic art devotee who suffers from a rare, debilitating brittle.
I:8424;1472;For a movie about a novice superhero, there are NO convincing action scenes.
I:8424;1473;And, after the Sixth Sense, he has gone to the final reel surprise!
I:8424;1474;I found myself screaming at the screen, get on with it!
I:8424;1475;There's something so insincere and smirky about Bruce Willis trying to be sensitive.
I:8424;1476;Just let him keep blowing stuff up!
I:8424;1477;Samuel L. Jackson was wonderful tho.
I:8424;1478;And the little boy, Spencer Treat Clark.
I:8424;1479;I've seen in before and the kid's a pleasure to watch.
I:8424;1480;To me the most amazing dialogue occurred between David Dunn and Elijah's mom while viewing Elijah's art work during an exhibition.
I:8424;1481;David says, you must be proud of your son.
I:8424;1482;Mom says, Yes I am soooo proud of what he has done!
I:8424;1483;This is a classic with a surprise ending.
I:8424;1484;This one kept moving .
I:8424;1485;The person most interested in the life and times of the Unbreakable Bruce Willis is Mr. Glass, a fellow whose limbs are so fragile, he fractures bones at the drop of a hat (or fall down a staircase).
I:8424;1486;That's what made it good.
I:8424;1487;Because in the corner of your mind you almost believed that just maybe.
I:8424;1488;Yes, there's a twist at the very end, but you can kind of figure it out as the movie goes along.
I:8424;1489;samuel Jackson's character is very sympathetic.
I:8424;1490;Bruce Willis' character is also very sympathetic .
I:8424;1491;The son gives a strong performance .
I:8424;1492;especially the scene where he figures out that his father is extraordinarily strong.
I:8424;1493;by far the best movie directed by M. Night.
I:8424;1494;This movie is kind of like watching a baseball game: 3 minutes of action packed in to three hours.
I:8424;1495;M. Night Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed this psychological thriller.
I:8424;1496;The stars include Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;1497;the movie starts with a train crash that David survives with no injuries.
I:8424;1498;So two extremes on the bell curve of strength that slowly and darkly to the surprise ending.
I:8424;1499;He meets them both unscathed.
I:8424;1500;an above average thriller of good and evil, black and white, strength and weakness.
I:8424;1501;I had heard and read a lot of reviews for this movie and maybe I approached it with lowered expectations as a result, however I found it truly fascinating.
I:8424;1502;The movie really explores our perceptions of ourselves and the place we have in the world and in relation to other people.
I:8424;1503;The most interesting character is that of Jackson and his personal story is powerful and filled with pathos.
I:8424;1504;As a collector of comics, Jackson tells Willis that he is some kind of hero.
I:8424;1505;The twist at the end is really impressive, and I think you should see it in order to find out.
I:8424;1506;I am a big fan of Night's previous work (6th Sense of course), and it's clear to me that he has a lot of ability.
I:8424;1507;I also think that Unbreakable is a good movie, with an interesting plot, interesting characters, and a nice twist at the end.
I:8424;1508;as it is, Night jumped right in with a record.
I:8424;1509;breaking blockbuster that may well be the best film he ever makes.
I:8424;1510;A truelly incredible album that many feel is their greatest work.
I:8424;1511;That kind of success is a two.
I:8424;1512;You'll find you enjoy them more.
I:8424;1513;Since this movie stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson I thought it would be good.
I:8424;1514;Samuel Jackson has a theory that characters in comic books are real and are on earth and represent good and evil.
I:8424;1515;This is actually the theme of the movie the best I could tell.
I:8424;1516;hero's from a whole new perspective.
I:8424;1517;Bruce Willis is excellent in the role, as a under.
I:8424;1518;hero, saving the world, it is about the discovery of one's purpose, and all the actors (Willis, Jackson, Wright and the kid) are performing at a very believable level.
I:8424;1519;M. night Shalabaladkialahjkadd, what ever his name is, made a few decent movies, this one is by far, his best.
I:8424;1520;I wanted to give it 3 stars based on the film's shaky storyline, but 5 stars for its breathtaking idea of taking a classic story and trying to mold it into the REAL world.
I:8424;1521;In this light, the film works beautifully in terms of self.
I:8424;1522;best image in the entire film.
I:8424;1523;Needless to say, I enjoyed this a lot.
I:8424;1524;"As with the director's last movie, The sixth sense (TSS), Shyamalan gives the audience another ""twist"" at the end of the film."
I:8424;1525;The twist in Unbreakable also seems a little less credible, but it's the journey to this twist that was highly enjoyable, and keeps the viewer hooked until it happens.
I:8424;1526;Samuel L. jackson is .
I:8424;1527;Bruce Willis is also good, though he'll never be accused of over.
I:8424;1528;The supporting cast is also worth a mention .
I:8424;1529;Robin Wright Penn (the wife), and a very impressive Spencer Treat Clark who plays the son.
I:8424;1530;i loved the visual style of the film, the mood and atmosphere, and in particular the way some of the scenes were shot, from the excellent opening sequence, to Jackson's tumble down the stairs.
I:8424;1531;All in all a good movie.
I:8424;1532;It may not have the shock twist ending that TSS had, but it does have great direction, script, acting and cast.
I:8424;1533;engrossing and enthralling cover, but just cover.
I:8424;1534;Like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable cloaks a deeply personal, philosophical message in an entertaining plot.
I:8424;1535;it's a perfect message for a generation raised on the idea t that they are unique and special.
I:8424;1536;the two are drawn together and so the movie unfolds.
I:8424;1537;it is the way that this is drawn out into a conclusion that leaves you feeling that the movie has been stopped, as opposed to coming to a natural end.
I:8424;1538;it was so close to being good!
I:8424;1539;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:8424;1540;script thrillers we are used to (you know the plot of all those other shows: There is a hero and a bad guy, the bad guy, for some reason, has a personal vendetta against the good guy and vice versa.
I:8424;1541;I'll give you a hint.
I:8424;1542;The script is fascinating, the direction is flawless.
I:8424;1543;The acting was great too.
I:8424;1544;Samuel L. Jackson was very good here.
I:8424;1545;After the Star Wars movies, I forgot that he could act, but found new faith in Unbreakable.
I:8424;1546;This was one of his best films.
I:8424;1547;I have to laugh when I read reviews,such as one below,about how this movie is 'misunderstood' now,but will be seen as a masterpiece in ten years.
I:8424;1548;shyamalan is the perfect director for today's hollywood.
I:8424;1549;In David he has found his exact opposit and.
I:8424;1550;the birth of a comicbook hero.
I:8424;1551;tHE CAST: Bruce Willis is giving another great performance as Davud Dunn, a man who slowly realizes his purpose in the world.
I:8424;1552;As much as I love to see him bleeding and cursing in action movies I think his serious roles are also convincing.
I:8424;1553;His counterpart Elijah Price is played by a wonderful Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;1554;He is one of those actors who can play anything.
I:8424;1555;He has got great costume design and a. well weird haircut to support the role.
I:8424;1556;It is the most intelligent and interesting story Hollywood has come up with last year.
I:8424;1557;Shyamalan directs the movie with very long shots, which lets you enjoy the great performances and slowly put you in the story.
I:8424;1558;There is always something to marvel at.
I:8424;1559;This movie features some of the most beautiful shots I have ever seen.
I:8424;1560;There are repeating motives such as reflections and symetry.
I:8424;1561;If you like comics you should take a look at this.
I:8424;1562;Not only was this the best film of last year, but one of the best ever!!!
I:8424;1563;All involved were superb making you believe this 'super' hero story whole heartedly.
I:8424;1564;If you like great characters and great handling of how to tell a story then this is for you, if you like a good twist then you'll like this,if you like a gripping and intense soundtrack then you'll like this, if you like comic book story told the 'proper' way, then you'll like this.
I:8424;1565;but most of all if you like film, then you'll love this.
I:8424;1566;Bruce Willice at his best, along with Samuel Jackson, what more could you ask for?
I:8424;1567;Sit back and enjoy the show.
I:8424;1568;I think this crew should have sat on the script another year and polished it a bit more.
I:8424;1569;The extras are nice .
I:8424;1570;but without a truly memorable film .
I:8424;1571;The pacing of Unbreakable is similar to The Sixth Sense, so if you are a fan of the latter you have a shot at the former.
I:8424;1572;Bruce Willis once again does a great job playing a somber regular guy in what he believes to be an unrealistic reality.
I:8424;1573;Any more detail and it's spoiled.
I:8424;1574;Just sit back and enjoy the mood of the movie.
I:8424;1575;"experience and massive awakening"" movie
I:8424;1576;in other words this is a comic book on film .
I:8424;1577;(did any of the characters actually crack a smile at all??)
I:8424;1578;most *definitely* do not allow anyone under 13 to see this movie.
I:8424;1579;At the beginning of this movie he is in one of the greatest train disasters of all time where everyone else dies, yet he survives without getting so much as a scratch.
I:8424;1580;those psychic skills lead him into some amazing adventures in this movie.
I:8424;1581;the other leading actor, Samuel L. Jackson, is a comic book collector who marvels in superhero qualities of the heroes in those comics.
I:8424;1582;He is the breakable one.
I:8424;1583;Samuel L. Jackson's character pushes Bruce Willis's character to accept his amazing abilities, both psychic and physical.
I:8424;1584;There are plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8424;1585;Though the ending was a little disappointing, the movie was enjoyable as a whole.
I:8424;1586;Great use to of anticipation.
I:8424;1587;While the movie is slower than most, that's exactly the reason it succeeds in my mind.
I:8424;1588;While most moviemakers would face the reality that moviegoers now EXPECT unbelieveable chase scenes, explosions, and impossible special effects, Shyamalan thankfully keeps the pace of the film consistent and eerily placid, providing the viewer with an uncommon viewing experience.
I:8424;1589;Jackson's performance is the icing on Shyamalan's brilliant cake.
I:8424;1590;You see, both the 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' follow the exact same plot.
I:8424;1591;Shyamalan is on record as being very immodest about the success he had with 'Sixth Sense', and so I guess he felt it necessary to incorporate Alfred Hitchock style camera angles in his latest venture .
I:8424;1592;What I *am* saying is that they have to be done well.
I:8424;1593;paced films, but they have to be handled very well.
I:8424;1594;that might make the movie so much more refreshing.
I:8424;1595;Making a great team, Bruce Willis and Director M. Night Shyamalan impress us again as a terrific story is told.
I:8424;1596;The acting is wonderful and the ending is phemonenal.
I:8424;1597;I really think that Shyamalan has a wonderful future ahead of him as he can provoke more thrills and surprises that any other director in Hollywood.
I:8424;1598;The best part about it?
I:8424;1599;He uses no excessive violene, not too much gore and times everything perfectly.
I:8424;1600;Unbreakable is an amazing film with amazing actors and an amazing script.
I:8424;1601;It is because of the success achieved by Sixth Sense that this movie was given any credit at all.
I:8424;1602;Studio executives hoped that the movie, a supernatural thriller, would perform well and make a profit.
I:8424;1603;His wife and son are ecstatic.
I:8424;1604;"leaving a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note engraved with the words ""Limited Edition""."
I:8424;1605;He traces the note to a chic art gallery that specializes in comic book art.
I:8424;1606;Yet he also senses something in what Elijah has said.
I:8424;1607;It has many interesting elements, including lots of references to comic book heroes.
I:8424;1608;There is a theme involving water that is excellent.
I:8424;1609;The photography and the set decoration are impeccable.
I:8424;1610;I thought of this while watching Unbreakable because, after all, even movies by The Master of Suspense varied greatly in success, both artistically and commercially.
I:8424;1611;It was the body of work by Hitchcock that was important, and I hope the same proves true of Mt. Shyamalan.
I:8424;1612;wHAT WORKS: Mysterious original plot working, great acting, directing and a suspenseful twist in the end which brings the whole movie together.
I:8424;1613;a. minute caper has awesome plot and character development and a unique sense of style which puts Director M. Night Shyamalan at the top of the line!
I:8424;1614;If you liked Sixth Sense you'll like Unbreakable.
I:8424;1615;Willis again puts in a strong performance as his character is slowly developed throughout the film.
I:8424;1616;Even though the movie has a superhero mystique to it, it is also highly realistic which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.
I:8424;1617;Samuel L. Jackson also puts in a strong performance as a supporting character.
I:8424;1618;It'll be worth your time.
I:8424;1619;The way he acts has always intriged me.
I:8424;1620;And of course Mr. Jackson plays his roles ever so eloquently.
I:8424;1621;I like to be surprised.
I:8424;1622;To me, the story is a very original one.
I:8424;1623;The hero/villain concept has been emphasized ever so nicely.
I:8424;1624;This film represents a refreshing take on the comic book genre.
I:8424;1625;Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give great performances.
I:8424;1626;Tonally, Unbreakable is excellent, although it does move slowly at times.
I:8424;1627;After seeing it, I was a Shyamalan fan.
I:8424;1628;The best part is Shyamalan's directing.
I:8424;1629;When I first heard about this movie it sounded kind of interesting.
I:8424;1630;This is a simple tale .
I:8424;1631;it's got to entertain you.
I:8424;1632;The reason I mention that the train crash is off screen is it sets up a comparison to another film of this year .
I:8424;1633;By the way I'm an avid comic fan and collector.
I:8424;1634;Great acting, good filming, and compelling storyline made for a truly memorable movie about two men bound together by fate.
I:8424;1635;Well, watch this movie and you'll see.
I:8424;1636;it really is an awesome film, and Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson do great job in their respective roles.
I:8424;1637;This is also one of M. Night Shymalan's better .
I:8424;1638;I've seen Sixth Sense a few times before this, and I knew there was going to be a twist to the film, just like Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1639;it's such a shame that Unbreakable didn't do as well as Sixth Sense at the box office, cos it's an amazing movie to watch.
I:8424;1640;It's fascinating to watch how it quickly reels the viewer .
I:8424;1641;bruce Willis seems to be a favourite of M. Night Shyamalan's, and quite right too!
I:8424;1642;He's been terrific in both Sixth Sense and this, and once again, shows he's great with kids, since he's so great with the little guy who plays his son.
I:8424;1643;But his character was cool.
I:8424;1644;"As a newborn, he's reflected in the mirror
I:8424;1645;this was a terrific movie, so don't believe all the bad reviews you see.
I:8424;1646;This is a good movie.
I:8424;1647;Much more realistic and has a good twist at the end.
I:8424;1648;If you like comic books, you'll probably love it.
I:8424;1649;My opinion is that he is a one hit wonder!
I:8424;1650;Bruce Willis has made some excellent movies but he should be ashamed of this one.
I:8424;1651;Take it for what it is: a good movie.
I:8424;1652;M. Night Shyamalan has done it again!
I:8424;1653;Although this movie is a bit slower than The 6th Sense, it still has you mezmorized waiting for that surprising ending that Shyamalan has becoming known for.
I:8424;1654;and it's definitely worth the wait.
I:8424;1655;Shyamalan and Willis said Unbreakable was intended as the first part of a trilogy.
I:8424;1656;this film, ESPECIALLY when viewed as the opening of a trilogy, sets up the world and its characters remarkably well.
I:8424;1657;With all the hype to this movie, I thought it was going to be a top.
I:8424;1658;Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard,who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.
I:8424;1659;His one solace in life is comic books.
I:8424;1660;there is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print.
I:8424;1661;At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4.
I:8424;1662;Let me give a brief overview of this movie and perhaps if it's something that interests you, you'll watch.
I:8424;1663;the story is basically a superhero story but an ultra realistic one.
I:8424;1664;the story does get slow in places, but I still enjoyed it immensely.
I:8424;1665;on the other side there is a man who is fragile and his bones can break easily, and his weekness is stairs and the fragile man reveals the invincable man his secret and things happen.
I:8424;1666;both Willis and Jackson are powerful as always and this one really grabs you from the shocking beginning to the horrible truth at the end.
I:8424;1667;M. Night Shamalayan burst on to the scene with the incredible SIXTH SENSE.
I:8424;1668;He is obviously a young director/writer with a vivid imagination, and perhaps a little bit too much belief in his artistry.
I:8424;1669;i think the plot is very intriguing, and there are some wonderful shots, including the use of comic book colors to heighten the sense of unreality.
I:8424;1670;"Bruce Willis and Spencer Treat Clark do a fantastic job in their roles
I:8424;1671;Clark is an uncanny little actor, who can be seen in this year's excellent Mystic River.
I:8424;1672;utilized his from a distance shots.
I:8424;1673;Jackson has yet to enthrall me with his acting (having watched Sphere and Deep Blue recently.
I:8424;1674;Penn on the other hand has done some good work, but in this one, she seems unattached and disinterested.
I:8424;1675;Unbreakable is an entertaining movie, and it's ending is quite surprising, but pulling a punch at the end doesn't rescue this movie from its other flaws.
I:8424;1676;Sure, Bruce Willis is in it, so it HAS to have a lot of cool action and stuff, right?
I:8424;1677;Unbreakable, is a superb, and yet, underrated film that should've gotten more recognition.
I:8424;1678;This is a dark thriller that messes with your mind and emotions.
I:8424;1679;It has great acting, a great story, and most of all, an ingenious plot.
I:8424;1680;Not to mention one amazing score.
I:8424;1681;It looks great, it sounds great, and it has TONS of special features.
I:8424;1682;I enjoyed watching the deleted scenes.
I:8424;1683;Bruce Willis is amazing in this movie, proving that he doesn't have to be in movies with only non.
I:8424;1684;Samuel L. Jackson is also outstanding.
I:8424;1685;overall, I loved the movie, and it continues to be one of my favorites.
I:8424;1686;This is a really great film that should've been recognized more.
I:8424;1687;Very unappreciated, but a lot of great films are.
I:8424;1688;Since you already know what to expect, just give it a shot.
I:8424;1689;If you know what you're in for, chances are you will enjoy the movie more.
I:8424;1690;stop action and a lot of cool explosions does NOT make a movie great.
I:8424;1691;One of a kind films from a one of a kind filmmakers.
I:8424;1692;The movie is a tiny bit slow but well worth the ending and the plot twists that occur throughout.
I:8424;1693;Bruce Willis is once again great as well is Samuel Jackson as Mr. glass.
I:8424;1694;Unbreakable is written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.
I:8424;1695;After this his life becomes intertwined with that of Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), a man with an unusual disability.
I:8424;1696;Unbreakable is a powerful drama.
I:8424;1697;it's an intriguing deconstruction of the whole notion of the comic book superhero.
I:8424;1698;Shyamalan does a superb job of weaving a paranormal storyline into the lives of characters who are fully fleshed and very real.
I:8424;1699;jackson and Willis are an intriguing and unnerving screen duo.
I:8424;1700;Jackson's bold, operatic performance is stunning, and is perfectly complemented by Willis' subtle but equally powerful work.
I:8424;1701;They are backed up by some excellent supporting performances.
I:8424;1702;Especially intriguing are the deleted scenes, which are preceded by fascinating commentary by writer.
I:8424;1703;This bonus material really illuminates the creative process behind this film and vividly shows Shyamalan's passion and craftsmanship as a cinematic artist.
I:8424;1704;in addition to being intelligently written and superbly acted, Unbreakable is a visually stylish film that is full of memorable images.
I:8424;1705;elijah has been an avid comic book reader for most of his life, and proposes an unusual theory to David.
I:8424;1706;this is the type of movie that revitalizes hope in mankind.
I:8424;1707;Maybe there really are extraordinary people among us that are genuinely good at heart and strive to help others.
I:8424;1708;as M. Night Shayamalan tends to do, the ending has a bit of a twist.
I:8424;1709;"Some people don't like it
I:8424;1710;the premise of the story is a good one, I just think it fell flat at the end.
I:8424;1711;There are some out in the world that say that comic.
I:8424;1712;last great link to the ancient art form of expressing messages and stories through pictures.
I:8424;1713;Even to this very day this language art form can be found in the average comic.
I:8424;1714;the story centers on a man whose survival from a tragic train accident begins to unravel a mystery into who he actually is and what he was destined to do with his life.
I:8424;1715;But the more David puts off the eccentric comic.
I:8424;1716;book curator, Elijah Price, the more the truth behind the great mysteries of his life is revealed to him, in that the David may be one of the great ?
I:8424;1717;For those who witness the magnificence of this film will find its thought.
I:8424;1718;provoking concepts of heroes and villains, both in the comic.
I:8424;1719;book world and how those are reflected in every day life, absolutely chilling, more so when one factors in the film?s pre.9/11 release.
I:8424;1720;Samuel L. Jackson does a magnificent job in the role of Elijah Price, the mysterious comic.
I:8424;1721;book artwork curator who uses his knowledge of the comic.
I:8424;1722;Triggered by those events, Americans have awakened to the truth, much in the same way David Dunne did, that ?
I:8424;1723;there are extraordinary things inside themselves, as well as others?
I:8424;1724;Shyamalan demonstrates an increasing sense of maturity both in the script?s sophisticated dialogue as well as in the style in which he sets the complex group of characters.
I:8424;1725;The rising director never ceases to amaze his audiences with the haunting atmospheres in which he set his films and the driving messages he invokes within in each and every one of them.
I:8424;1726;I deeply enjoy movies told in a comic book style, like The Crow.
I:8424;1727;I didn't expect that from this movie, and was pleasantly surprised.
I:8424;1728;David has some problems, and the true conflict of the plot subtly emerges from each of the lesser issues he faces.
I:8424;1729;the story is told in Shyamalan's slowly revealing style, where we learn little bits about the character nad their personalities.
I:8424;1730;Samuel Jackson plays a fabulously underrated role as a crazed villan, and his carefully crafted character truly makes the story.
I:8424;1731;the movie, throughout, has a comic.
I:8424;1732;The realization and climax of the movie are well.
I:8424;1733;While I would have enjoyed more examination of the aftermath, the story remained well.
I:8424;1734;i viewed this title DTS mode, and was impressed by both the ambiance and staging of the sound.
I:8424;1735;The menus and special features are wonderfully done.
I:8424;1736;The directory of photography definitely had his own style, that's for sure.
I:8424;1737;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson star in this movie, and M. Night Shyamalan is the director and filmaker.
I:8424;1738;I love Shyamalan's work, and also recommend The Sixth Sense, which he also wrote.
I:8424;1739;It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense.
I:8424;1740;"Be patient
I:8424;1741;It's been a while since I've seen a thriller with a more assured opening.
I:8424;1742;These moments are handled stylishly, but with a genuine purpose.
I:8424;1743;director M. Night Shyamalan frames his shots wonderfully, controlling the symbolism with an iron hand and creating the tone with a painter's palette.
I:8424;1744;"The film was building up a reservoir of good will
I:8424;1745;important whispered delivery he's developed over recent years.
I:8424;1746;"she says to her son at one point, with utmost sincerity
I:8424;1747;as for that notorious surprise ending, well, Shyamalan proves once again that he knows how to catch the audience off.
I:8424;1748;the true, hardcore comic fan may get a kick out of this flick.
I:8424;1749;it is a fascinating story with a great deal of depth to it, and it is extremely atmospheric, at times even spooky.
I:8424;1750;"The performances are excellent
I:8424;1751;There was also a great chemistry between him and Samuel L Jackson, who was intense, and suprisingly chilling as Price.
I:8424;1752;provoking and unusual film, Unbreakable is utterly riveting, and one of the best films of the last fifteen months .
I:8424;1753;david Dunn (Willis) is a security guard, whose family life is crumbling.
I:8424;1754;until slowly, he begins to discover amazing things.
I:8424;1755;we must not be confused by the similarities between Unbreakable and Sixth Sense: certainly both were written and directed by Shyamalan, starred Willis, set in Philadelphia and structured in three acts, but the similarities end there.
I:8424;1756;While Sixth Sense was a character drama with a supernatural touch, Unbreakable is a mysterious history with continuous growing suspense.
I:8424;1757;faith, coincidence and the presence of a sixth sense are constant subjects in this story, where two men opposed in many ways .
I:8424;1758;must learn to develop their instincts and to discover their mission in life.
I:8424;1759;"the cinematographic style applied to the film maintains an involving and realistic tone: the images are deep, full of important actions
I:8424;1760;while the central characters and their complicated emotional maps are exposed, we get caught by the unusual world the movie displays.
I:8424;1761;Bruce Willis reflects a wide emotional turbulence as the reticent man who has to accept his destiny, while Jackson is magnetic like the man full of fantastic theories, worthy of a lunatic who has just escaped an asylum.
I:8424;1762;once again, Shyamalan demonstrates that he is a brilliant film director.
I:8424;1763;Imaginative, able to surprise, confuse and please our expectations.
I:8424;1764;"His work in the direction keeps exploring new ways
I:8424;1765;an unexpected end, although not as surprising as the one in Sixth Sense, will leave you with the sensation that Shyamalan, without no impudence, has made fun of us again.
I:8424;1766;With interesting plot and deep philosophical message, it could have been a great movie.
I:8424;1767;Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan of one of the two main actors!
I:8424;1768;Unbreakable, I find to be a very underrated M. Night Shyamalan film.
I:8424;1769;I find the Sixth Sense to be slightly overrated, I find this film a bit underrated.
I:8424;1770;I personally enjoy this film more than Sixth Sense.
I:8424;1771;I am a fan of superhero films as well.
I:8424;1772;I like that this is a new take on superheroes at the time.
I:8424;1773;He is the one who tells David about his gift.
I:8424;1774;the acting is good all around.
I:8424;1775;I really like his dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's character.
I:8424;1776;My favorite scenes of the movie are when those two characters are talking to each other.
I:8424;1777;the effects are great in this.
I:8424;1778;I also really like the theme of destiny that is played up in this film.
I:8424;1779;It deserves at least one viewing.
I:8424;1780;I it easily one of Shyamalan's best films.
I:8424;1781;Unbreakable is the kind of movie that makes you think.
I:8424;1782;Bruce Willis is wonderful as the reluctant hero who finds no way out of his destiny.
I:8424;1783;Elajah Price ( Samuel L Jackson)has a condition that leaves his bones extremely vulnerable to breaking and develops the nickname Mr. Glass .
I:8424;1784;He is also a comic book specialist.
I:8424;1785;His theory is that comic book heroes walk the earth, and due to the recent events, Elajah suspects that David is one of them.
I:8424;1786;At the other end is someone who is extremely strong and invulnerable.
I:8424;1787;David soon discovers that he has never been sick, never been injured, has exceptional strength, and possesses a unique gift that others don't.
I:8424;1788;m. Night Shyamalan made one of the most popular horror films in history with The Sixth Sense .
I:8424;1789;But in my opinion, Unbreakable is his best film and extremely underrated.
I:8424;1790;While people often criticize this film for being too slow, and hard to understand, it still continues to be one of my favorite films.
I:8424;1791;The fact that the films move slowly, is what gives the film its brilliance.
I:8424;1792;The events unfold at a pace that really lets you soak in the story and what the characters are going through.
I:8424;1793;The fifth being what David does with his life, after he finds the truth.
I:8424;1794;All of these aspects are blended together beautifully to create a well rounded story.
I:8424;1795;Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Robin Wright Penn are all spectacular in their roles.
I:8424;1796;Each bring an important part to the story and are equally captivating.
I:8424;1797;Finally, the camera work, set designs, and use of color are amazing, and really bring the story to life.
I:8424;1798;They really let you see the film in a whole new light.
I:8424;1799;You get additional scenes, a behind the scenes documentary, and much much more.
I:8424;1800;mY REVIEW: Like Director M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, this film also proves that he writes the greatest stories with great and unique plots that make you think.
I:8424;1801;This film rises on all levels and is an original motion picture that deserves a lot of credit.
I:8424;1802;fOR THE STORY: A , I just love it, with the twists, the believable of the unbelievable.
I:8424;1803;This mysterious movie takes you beyond the depths of the mind and takes you into a world where fantasy really could be reality.
I:8424;1804;Not that I believe in the movie, but it is a great story that keeps you guessing, and the ending is most promising, and ties it all together.
I:8424;1805;fOR THE DIRECTING: A , Shyamalan did a superb job working with the story and the actors.
I:8424;1806;tHE ACTING:BRUCE WILLIS: A , fun, intelligent role that creates a sort of wonder in your mind, cheering for him in the silent form.
I:8424;1807;David Dunn is the new great superhero of today.
I:8424;1808;BRUCE WILLIS is remarkable and gives one of his best performances yet, siding with DIE HARD, ARMAGEDDON and THE SIXTH SENSE.
I:8424;1809;Playing the strong minded comic fan who seems to put all the pieces of David's life together, who seems to come up with all the answers.
I:8424;1810;She feels that David surviving the train crash is like a second chance for her and she wants to start over.
I:8424;1811;'So OVERALL: You can't give this movie less than an A. , because it is a well thought out film with big surprises and talented celebrities pieceing together the movie.
I:8424;1812;Good movies like this don't come around too often, so catch this one while you can.
I:8424;1813;Let me count the ways!
I:8424;1814;It's very easy to make a surprise ending if you just pick it out thin air.
I:8424;1815;Unlike his brilliant Sixth Sense which plays well multiple times because it was true to itself.
I:8424;1816;the great thing about m. night shyamalan's is that their never really *about* what they purport to be.
I:8424;1817;it's about family, namely a boy and his mother, and the intricacies of their relationship.
I:8424;1818;m. night shyamala's best film, 'unbreakable,' repeats a similar theme.
I:8424;1819;on the surface, yes, it's about a simple man accepting the superhero mantle.
I:8424;1820;but it's much more than that: it's about a fractured family coming back together.
I:8424;1821;this familial theme is what makes shyamalan's work so important.
I:8424;1822;every line reveals something important, gives us insight into the characters or advances plot.
I:8424;1823;most importantly, his characters are real.
I:8424;1824;penn, samuel l. jackson and spencer treat clark.
I:8424;1825;penn's perfomance is especially notable.
I:8424;1826;when she asks bruce willis' character if 'he's been with anyone else' is so heartbreaking and delivered with such intensity and honesty that she nearly steals the film in that one scene.
I:8424;1827;bruce willis lends his character a nice bit of gravitas.
I:8424;1828;and watching his mope around as the emotionally detached david dunn is strangely riveting.
I:8424;1829;always reliable, jacks plays a nutty character without a surprising amout of restaint which makes him all the more believable.
I:8424;1830;and finally, spencer treat clark is amazing as david's doe.
I:8424;1831;eyed son, the only one who initially believes in his father's abilities (shyamalan has as incredible knack for casting the right people, especially children, in his films).
I:8424;1832;view this film as a family study and it will be that much more rewarding.
I:8424;1833;I think this is a great example of a director missing the boat.
I:8424;1834;Actually, people liked 6TH SENSE's scares and the twist ending.
I:8424;1835;I agree that this could've been much better but it is still a great movie overall.
I:8424;1836;This movie was written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Sixth Sense).
I:8424;1837;the ending was surprising but you could kind of see it coming.
I:8424;1838;I thought the ending was going to be really great but it turned out just to be good.
I:8424;1839;comic Book and Superheroes with Samuel L. Jackson (20 minutes).
I:8424;1840;overall this movie was great and I am glad to own it.
I:8424;1841;If you were a fan of Sixth Sense I recommend this.
I:8424;1842;It really comes together when you get it then you enjoy the movie more.
I:8424;1843;Samuel Jackson is an avid comic book entrepeneur who approaches Bruce Willis with the notion that Willis is actually a real life super hero.
I:8424;1844;It is interesting to watch Willis struggle with what he believes to be a ridiculous suggestion as he reviews key events in his life.
I:8424;1845;Samuel Jackson helps Willis through the test process of the thesis.
I:8424;1846;there are other interesting character interactions throughout the movie including Willis' interactions with his wife and son.
I:8424;1847;The movie is NOT action packed but excellent nonetheless.
I:8424;1848;I am not an avid comic book reader and I am uncertain how one who is will react, but I suspect they will enjoy it.
I:8424;1849;The plot and the angle in which the director took to develop it is genius.
I:8424;1850;I found this movie to be thought.
I:8424;1851;This is simply a great movie.
I:8424;1852;Open your mind and enjoy.
I:8424;1853;It's a little slow at times, but it is a great superhero film with a little more realism than say Spiderman.
I:8424;1854;Whilst 'The Sixth Sense' was a brilliantly made movie that revolutionised the ghost genre and took it into the new millenium, 'Unbreakable' is a much more ordinary piece.
I:8424;1855;the movie is an odd mixture of brilliance and mediocrity with an intriguing yet still obvious story.
I:8424;1856;Once again Shyamalan draws exceptional performances from the cast, especially Willis who all of a sudden seems to have become a very good actor indeed.
I:8424;1857;Jackson is uniformly excellent, as is Pen Wright and although the kid is certainly no Haley Joel Osmont, he is definitely a cut above most child actors.
I:8424;1858;It succeeds on a number of levels as once again Shyamalan proves that he is the master of ghostly suspense, with the few shocks included here deriving mostly from clever camera work along with stunning photography.
I:8424;1859;Moreover, it is a decidedly adult movie that should be applauded on many levels.
I:8424;1860;2000 was the year when not just one but two great comic book movies were made: Unbreakable and the X. men.
I:8424;1861;The scene between Bruce and Robin on their date is brilliantly written in its subtlety.
I:8424;1862;The scene with the young Sam Jackson is absolutely heart.
I:8424;1863;wrenching (especially if you have kids).
I:8424;1864;The documentary about comics is great with Frank Miller in all his ragged glory.
I:8424;1865;This is a great movie.
I:8424;1866;The acting by Bruce Willis is excellent.
I:8424;1867;I have become a big fan of M. Night Shymallan.
I:8424;1868;i thought the cinematography was wonderful.
I:8424;1869;the story was well written and the character development of David is done very well.
I:8424;1870;Also the complex relationship he has with his wife is portrayed nicely.
I:8424;1871;A great piece of work.
I:8424;1872;the movie itself was pretty good.
I:8424;1873;After watching the incredible movie, The Sixth Sense, I was sure that this film would be excellent.
I:8424;1874;The ending made me laugh, and even though this film was not meant to be realistic, the overall premise seemed completely silly.
I:8424;1875;I think that it's important to make the distinction between what a movie is, and what a film is.
I:8424;1876;Films are a rare art form.
I:8424;1877;I can be entertained by explosions, bombs and blondes as much as the next guy, but I'm always up for a great film.
I:8424;1878;Shyamalan takes this beyond modern day movie making to create a truly wonderful film with an original story.
I:8424;1879;But, if you want to see a magnificent film with an intelligently and artfully told story, then see Unbreakable.
I:8424;1880;It should be the first great film of the trilogy.
I:8424;1881;it has an unusual premise, in that it is really a 'reality.
I:8424;1882;the movie is about Elijah's search for the type of person that he believes comics depict .
I:8424;1883;david is naturally sceptical to begin with, something that is aided by distorted memories of a serious car accident that he was involved in earlier in his life.
I:8424;1884;through a series of incidences, David comes to the astounding realisation that Elijah was right all along, and there are a number of small, seemingly insignificant points that help to emphasise this.
I:8424;1885;found talents to use by saving the lives of two children from a violent intruder that he comes to understand the sadness is, in fact, the result of not doing what he was born to do .
I:8424;1886;in tradition with Shyamalan's previous film, The Sixth Sense, there is a twist at the end of this film.
I:8424;1887;Although it doesn't have as much impact as Shyamalan's spooky ghost story, it is still a stunner, nevertheless.
I:8424;1888;and, it's a surprisingly enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
I:8424;1889;The following month, I had a conversation with my cousin, who is also an avid movie buff, about this film.
I:8424;1890;He told me that he felt it was a wholly original and innovative suspense film that satisfied from start to finish.
I:8424;1891;I don't feel this is a wholly original and innovative film, but I do feel it is a more.
I:8424;1892;solid effort and definitely a step in the right direction of greatness for writer.
I:8424;1893;This man is David, played excellently by Bruce Willis who gives the character the same subtle, soft.
I:8424;1894;It begins when he is approached by a man named Elijah, played with dark and cool intensity by the always.
I:8424;1895;He tells David a hair.
I:8424;1896;This film has the style, imagery and feel of a Hitchcock film.
I:8424;1897;It's story unfolds in layers and surprises you with plot twists that you would have never guessed, and its dark overtones are all elements extracted directly from the master of suspense.
I:8424;1898;He has an innovative approach to storytelling and a mind that knows no boundaries when it comes to what the imagination will take seriously.
I:8424;1899;that comic books are the primary conduit of modern mythology .
I:8424;1900;But that may also be what gives this film a perfect balance between artistic and fun.
I:8424;1901;It is something you and your sweetheart can go enjoy at a drive.
I:8424;1902;Watch this one with an open mind.
I:8424;1903;"I walked in with pictures of ""The Sixth Sense"" in mind, and was foolishly expecting the same experience."
I:8424;1904;let me put it this way:Unbreakable is more like a painting.
I:8424;1905;it is a story of self.
I:8424;1906;"being that this movie is a ""work of art"" cinematography is extremely important."
I:8424;1907;"Watch the ""Train Station"" sequence."
I:8424;1908;Look for the subtle things: way characters are dressed, colors of clothes and objects, camera shots that build suspense.
I:8424;1909;It hovers on that beautifull line between the believable and the unbelievable.
I:8424;1910;above all, watch this one more than once.
I:8424;1911;His previous film, The Sixth Sense, was a surprise super smash hit and was even nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.
I:8424;1912;He meets an eccentric comic book collector named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a bone disease which causes his bones to break very easily.
I:8424;1913;Elijah has a theory that the world of comic books is a near reflection of our very own world, and that he and David are on the opposite ends of the spectrum.
I:8424;1914;Willis and Jackson give superb performances, and Shyamalan's attention to detail.
I:8424;1915;"esque direction electrifies the pace of the film, but the meat and bones of Unbreakable is the way it is written
I:8424;1916;This underlying theme, combined with the twist ending (although I can see how some viewers did not like it at all) make Unbreakable a superb film on it's own right.
I:8424;1917;All in all, if you can forget about The Sixth Sense phenomena for a little over an hour and a half and really think about this film, you will enjoy it for what it is and isn't.
I:8424;1918;There is always something special about the blu.
I:8424;1919;ray form that makes the movie even better.
I:8424;1920;up to M. Night's The Sixth Sense was very highly anticipated by me and many others who found his first movie breathtaking.
I:8424;1921;The former has strength beyond his knowledge, while the latter uses cunning to overcome his physical limitations.
I:8424;1922;"Others might call it a suspense movie, as it has all the hallmarks of a classic suspense
I:8424;1923;Maybe it is a combination of all three genres, another achievement from the M. Knight Shamalayan.
I:8424;1924;however one might classify this movie, it is an incredible piece of story.
I:8424;1925;Third, each hero needs a weakness.
I:8424;1926;Superman had kryptonite, Batman had his past and Spiderman has his loved ones.
I:8424;1927;But here, it is the villian who seeks out the hero, helps him find his power, and finally, guarantees the hero's victory by sealing his own doom.
I:8424;1928;overall, this was a great movie.
I:8424;1929;For the budget it was made one, with the cast it starred, it delivers a great story with heart and soul.
I:8424;1930;The conceptual background of comicbooks contrasts nicely with the plot itself.
I:8424;1931;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8424;1932;Instantly David is thrust into the media, catching the attention of Elijah (Samuel Jackson), a mysterious stranger with a rare disease that causes his bones to break.
I:8424;1933;Elijah, obssessed with comic books, and their heroes, has spent his life looking for the one person the complete opposite of himself, someone who can not be broken, this he thinks he found in David.
I:8424;1934;This movie deserves a 5.
I:8424;1935;it makes you think and takes a topic alot of people are interested in (Comic Books) and turns that topic on its head.
I:8424;1936;if anything I found this to be among his most powerful.
I:8424;1937;It all hinges on the fact that when profound evil manifests, the universe creates equally powerful good to even the balance and put things right.
I:8424;1938;willis is perfect as the ordinary man that slowly comes to realize that he is far from ordinary.
I:8424;1939;The way that he slowly realizes that the only limitations on him are those imposed by his own doubts is most believable.
I:8424;1940;Jackson's performance is equally believable as the dark mirror to Willis.
I:8424;1941;documentary on comic books and their meaning is quite good.
I:8424;1942;I especially enjoyed actually seeing Frank Millar and Alex Ross talk about their motivations.
I:8424;1943;And as most of the creators point out, the motivations behind the best comics are archetypical and mythological.
I:8424;1944;They are the popular breakout of the power of myth in an otherwise profane and meaningless age.
I:8424;1945;This movie works on so many levels.
I:8424;1946;Just a good ol' fashioned story telling.
I:8424;1947;Comic book fans, such as I, should rejoice that Hollywood finally got one right.
I:8424;1948;I think the concept of the movie was great.
I:8424;1949;Just throw something up on the screen to have a little closure and we're done!
I:8424;1950;I can just see that being said when they got to the end of this movie!
I:8424;1951;What is the point of pounding into our heads that in every comic is a villian and a hero, then have the hero turn away when he finally meets his counter.
I:8424;1952;This is a quiet, subdued kind of film that takes a look into superheroes in a new sort of way that only Shyamalan could do.
I:8424;1953;box and full screen so more people could enjoy this awesome film.
I:8424;1954;It is truly worth seeing just for the quiet performances of bruce Willis and Samual L. Jackson.
I:8424;1955;This movie was superbly well done.
I:8424;1956;It was well acted, directed, is captivating and original.
I:8424;1957;Most importantly, it is imaginative and not at all what I was expecting it to be.
I:8424;1958;Anyone telling you the basic premise of the movie before you've seen it is doing both you, and the movie, a great disservice.
I:8424;1959;It's more the movie itself that's the surprise.
I:8424;1960;It is a slower, more deliberate movie lead by emotion with just the right mix of plot and character development.
I:8424;1961;Its mix of one take scenes, creative camera angles, and unique sound effects also helps to give it a refreshing feel from the stale styles of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.
I:8424;1962;This is a movie that makes you want to believe.
I:8424;1963;M. Night Shyamalan has done three mainstream films.
I:8424;1964;Signs which is a homage to B. movie films and Unbreakable .
I:8424;1965;Night does all of that here in a modern day reworking of these themes which is played out with a hint of realism.
I:8424;1966;This sort of gives it more appeal and makes it less fantastic and thus closer to reality.
I:8424;1967;It is a good flick and well worth watching if you like the nostalgia of this theme.
I:8424;1968;It's about a disorder which Mr. Shyamalan describes with such detail in this movie that one wonders how close he is personally to this pathology.
I:8424;1969;surprising since this pathology is estimated to exist at a 1% frequency in America (0.7% are male).
I:8424;1970;I would recommend that all interested reviewers learn more about this!
I:8424;1971;Once you learn just a little about this disorder, you will instantly and unequivocally see the true meaning of this film and your understanding will enrich your appreciation.
I:8424;1972;It will then make perfect sense.
I:8424;1973;In fact, he portrays it so convincingly that one may reasonably ask if he does indeed live with this disorder.
I:8424;1974;His conversation with the woman on the train reveals signs of the illness.
I:8424;1975;"He is experiencing the depression concomitant with the ""grandiosity gap"", that is, a realization of the disparity between his carefully crafted self."
I:8424;1976;She has learned which topics he can tolerate and which ones are best avoided.
I:8424;1977;His son Joseph, chronically neglected by his dad, is headed in the same direction emotionally as David's wife.
I:8424;1978;"another important hallmark of this disorder is ""magical thinking""."
I:8424;1979;"To be considered extraordinary and invincible, David has ""special powers""."
I:8424;1980;"He can feel the ""evil"" about him."
I:8424;1981;"Those with NPD describe themselves as having ""perfect insight"" into others and a gifted intuition."
I:8424;1982;This is his internal world, reflected in the somber, depressive, and emotionless cinematographic treatment.
I:8424;1983;"Although occasionally David may be right (50/50), towards the end we see his ""special"" instincts betraying him."
I:8424;1984;"Many reviewers described David as ""the ordinary man"" and perhaps, at this point in time, that's what it looks like."
I:8424;1985;But be assured that David sees himself as anything but ordinary!
I:8424;1986;deprecating in order to maintain the illusion of charm and downplay their arrogance .
I:8424;1987;He wants to rejoin that part of himself.
I:8424;1988;When Elijah, told all his life that he is fragile and dependent, is for once daring to enjoy the autonomy of taking a tilt.
I:8424;1989;a. whirl ride, his mother comes absolutely unhinged.
I:8424;1990;"She screams in anguish
I:8424;1991;"at the funeral of the train victims, David talks to the priest about his football days (many Ns embrace and are quite successful in competitive sports such as football) and reiterates his special status as ""sole survivor""."
I:8424;1992;Interestingly, David's wife, Audrey, is managing Elijah's recovery.
I:8424;1993;Another feature worth noting is that David and Audrey always seem to be on the verge of breaking up but never actually do.
I:8424;1994;He is baptized into a new life through the water, his only vulnerability.
I:8424;1995;The fact that Elijah still exists is a miracle because this disorder is considered incurable and there are no medications for it.
I:8424;1996;This film had a good plot line and great acting from Willis and Jackson, and I like it, but it just pales in comparison with The Sixth Sense and Signs, Shyamalan's masterpieces.
I:8424;1997;If you're a comic fan go watch Spider.
I:8424;1998;Unbreakable is an incredible work.
I:8424;1999;The directing and writing are perfect, the acting is incredible, and the score is excellent.
I:8424;2000;Night surpasses The Sixth Sense with this brilliant work.
I:8424;2001;I would agree that the twist isn't as shocking as that of the Sixth Sense, but the rest of the story is so intergrated, and crafted that the twist still works.
I:8424;2002;The style in the film is incredible.
I:8424;2003;There is no standard shot, every thing is original, with nice camera movement and framing.
I:8424;2004;It's a must for any comic book fan, as well as any fan of good acting.
I:8424;2005;Samuel L. Jackson is a commanding screen presence.
I:8424;2006;The comic book documentary is great, especially the interview with Dave Gibbons from Watchmen.
I:8424;2007;It was an incredible scene.
I:8424;2008;this film is a fantastic work of art with meaning deeply hidden under the guise of plot or story line.
I:8424;2009;The feeling I received after viewing this film was a deep sense of loss.
I:8424;2010;Our villain helped someone discover their greatness.
I:8424;2011;I have a feeling that our director/writer was aware of this truth of life.
I:8424;2012;The movie clearly depicts the sheer amount of trauma it takes for us to realize our purpose.
I:8424;2013;I think this is a great question to ask ourselves in regards to the meanings in life that we overlook.
I:8424;2014;Questions like this are ultimate goals of all pure art of this nature.
I:8424;2015;Like literature film can be a great educational tool.
I:8424;2016;I find this motion picture to be especially educational and rewarding.
I:8424;2017;Security Guard David Dunn miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia.
I:8424;2018;First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't.
I:8424;2019;The score by James Newton Howard comes through beautifully with the dts!
I:8424;2020;I found the dts to be a lot more of a natural sound.
I:8424;2021;The LFE gets used when needed and does get put to good use.
I:8424;2022;but more engaging than the first M. n. s./Bruce Willis film.
I:8424;2023;The twists and turns kept me engaged and the end.
I:8424;2024;heroes and villans.you will enjoy this.
I:8424;2025;"I have a friend who works as a foley artist (sound effects) and he said that when working on this film they called it ""un."
I:8424;2026;"The 6th sense gives you two memorable and (as far as fantasy goes) credible characters, an interesting and gripping story and a fantastic and satisfying ending that makes you pound your head saying ""why didn't I see/how could I have missed that""."
I:8424;2027;They do NOT fit the story of an unbelieving comic book hero and hooded avenger!
I:8424;2028;"When the train ""crashed"" at the beginning with no action scene whatsoever, I still thought ""Ah, so this one is purely psychological ."
I:8424;2029;this scene certainly got a big laugh from me!
I:8424;2030;was by no means as satisfying.
I:8424;2031;I like comics, I appreciate good(!)
I:8424;2032;unbreakable has to have one of the best packaging designs that I have ever seen.
I:8424;2033;next is the artwork that comes packaged with the box, along with a good manual.
I:8424;2034;paged manuals, but this one is good and interesting to look at.
I:8424;2035;You will go behind the scenes of the movie and of comic production and see how the two influenced each other.
I:8424;2036;Put a couple of stars in it, some nice previews and bingo.
I:8424;2037;although theres a cheeky line it where he hypothetically takes the p**s out of Willis by imaging he could have run a successful chain of restaurants which I thought was cute.
I:8424;2038;Mr Invincible has become H2O man.
I:8424;2039;the actor playing his young one looks like he's seen Sixth Sense and Osmans (and Spielbergs AI) stunning performance and tries to better it.
I:8424;2040;If Willis keeps going down hill they will have to start subpoenaing those cinema audiences again.
I:8424;2041;If you watch this film with Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson you'll find that the film maker has an opinion of fans of comics.
I:8424;2042;After I saw this I'd say he makes a statement that comics fans are an isolated bunch.
I:8424;2043;My only dissappointment was that the film maker never got what I thought was good looking comic covers and art to display in the film.
I:8424;2044;"Go see this without knowing its plot
I:8424;2045;The actors are all top calibur, and all give top level performances.
I:8424;2046;The director is truly a visionary, and his flow and ideas are the bedrock of this film.
I:8424;2047;But the film, even with its slow pace, manages to hook the viewer into this unstable world that the cinematographer and director have brilliantly created through artistic and gentle style.
I:8424;2048;The music is some of the best.
I:8424;2049;The music is simply gorgeous, and matches the film perfectly.
I:8424;2050;Through the entire film, you will truly believe that this film is real.
I:8424;2051;i must salute the entire production team for taking such a cliched, campy, and ridiculous premise, and turning it into a gritty, realistic and gripping piece of art.
I:8424;2052;But in my humble opinion, it is honestly some far greater, and more masterful.
I:8424;2053;You have earned my respect.
I:8424;2054;But with each time I see it.
I:8424;2055;Unbreakable is now my favorite all time movie.
I:8424;2056;Because I knew it enjoyed it.
I:8424;2057;it is the type of movie that you absorb.
I:8424;2058;"that I understood it is a ""super hero"" movie."
I:8424;2059;i just got caught up in the story of a man discovering who he is.
I:8424;2060;I loved the reality of this movie.
I:8424;2061;"For example, I loved how ""David""."
I:8424;2062;"For instance, I wonder just how strong Bruce Willis's character ""David Dunn"" really is?"
I:8424;2063;Due to the incredible ending.
I:8424;2064;i wonder if David's superhero career ends before it even really gets started.
I:8424;2065;if you give this movie a chance, you may also be blown away by how great it is.
I:8424;2066;I believe it is Night's best movie.
I:8424;2067;"There are few filmakers who have such a compelling style that the style is defined in their films: Among them, Kubrik, Spielberg, Lucas
I:8424;2068;What has made those directors so remarkable is their instantly recognizable style.
I:8424;2069;In the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan defined his style with an intriguing suspensful story filled with twists and clues that lead to an unexpected conclusion.
I:8424;2070;It's glammed up to sell cartoons and toys, as Jackson's character says in the film.
I:8424;2071;shyamalan asserts that comic books are part of our society .
I:8424;2072;Here, Shyamalan brilliantly develops a sort of theme.
I:8424;2073;the undeniable brilliance in this film, however, lies in the filmaking.
I:8424;2074;Like Sixth Sense, this film is full of clues and symbols.
I:8424;2075;Shyamalan is tipping his hat to the key inspiration to this film: comic books.
I:8424;2076;the rest of the cast and crew puts this film together as well.
I:8424;2077;This film is hard to imagine without Bruce Willis in the main role, who delivers a similar humble approach to his unforgettable role in Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2078;Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant in his role as the mysterious character who introduces Willis to his gift.
I:8424;2079;The music also helps create a moody suspensful atmosphere required for such a film.
I:8424;2080;this film is also fun.
I:8424;2081;Superhero movies are jokes unless they have high profile actors, big names and special effects to sell (like X. men for example).
I:8424;2082;Shyamalin is making the movies that a director should make: the stuff he/she loves and thinks is fun.
I:8424;2083;The idea of superheroes is ever compelling and rarely done well in cinema.
I:8424;2084;Shyamalin does it and does it well.
I:8424;2085;People tend to fall into two camps on this one, loved it and hated it.
I:8424;2086;Go get something good instead.
I:8424;2087;Acting by Willis and Jackson was superb.
I:8424;2088;The best actors in the world can portray there thoughts into movements and gestures and not only words.
I:8424;2089;Story appealed to all ages,comics appealed to kids and idea of superhuman strength/abilities appealed to sci.
I:8424;2090;Bruce Willis should be ashamed of himself for allowing someone to get him into this part.
I:8424;2091;the film was fantastic and if you leave it unfinished, then you only give more credence to those critics of the film.
I:8424;2092;Anway, the file is truly a great film and I do hope that light bulb goes on in somebody's head about finsihing the trilogy.
I:8424;2093;I give it 5 stars because it truly is in with top league of great films.
I:8424;2094;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are superstars that make this movie about super.
I:8424;2095;Unbreakable answers these questions in a very compelling way.
I:8424;2096;i love movies and give a LOT of leeway, thinking about how movies have to be involving on many levels to many people.
I:8424;2097;I hope the director uses his talent in the future to create and mold a great story, not a dorky comic.
I:8424;2098;artist fetish like this one.
I:8424;2099;I was really, pleasantly surprised and impressed by it.
I:8424;2100;That's definitely the theme throughout the whole movie where we see how a normal person would react upon realizing that he's above normal men.
I:8424;2101;This is one movie that's definitely a keeper and will be watched several times.
I:8424;2102;Unbreakable is really quite a beautiful movie.
I:8424;2103;The acting is also uniformly very good.
I:8424;2104;Curiously realistic unlike any other film of this genre and certainly more artsy.
I:8424;2105;A good film overall .
I:8424;2106;Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson both give really memorable performances.
I:8424;2107;Second, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen that deals with a man's loss sense of self (AKA mid.
I:8424;2108;i love the combination of scenes when, after our hero saves the girls, who in turn save him, and then he commits himself to action by destroying the killer in the house.
I:8424;2109;He comes home and carries his wife to bed looking to reconect with her.
I:8424;2110;this is a great movie.
I:8424;2111;If you haven't watched this movie and don't know the ending it is well worth watching.
I:8424;2112;Even if you do know the ending the mix of dialog, character development and action is worth a first (or second) view.
I:8424;2113;I wanted very much to love M. Night Shyamalan's next film after The Sixth Sense, but going away from it I only just enjoyed it.
I:8424;2114;Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give amazing performances, and the film is very well directed .
I:8424;2115;The film is well composed, and it may well be the best effort in bringing comic book superheroes into a more real world.
I:8424;2116;If someday it is, this film is an excellent start.
I:8424;2117;The video presented here is excellent, as is the Audio.
I:8424;2118;I was really surprised by this movie.
I:8424;2119;It takes two relativly simple characters in Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, brings them together and makes quite an impressice movie.
I:8424;2120;while the individual story points, Jackson bones breaking, marriage issues, a person who doesn't remember their past blocking their true potential and what it means to be a hero, all appear simple they are woven together and create a powerful emotional message for those able to grasp it.
I:8424;2121;following Bruce Willis's progress was surprisingly a fun ride as we all go through a period where we try and realize who we are and it's almost always interesting to view a character trying to complete that journey.
I:8424;2122;Still I loved this movie and really recommend it.
I:8424;2123;into our everday life, which was essentially a 20th Century North American artistic phenomenon, becoming everyday Real.
I:8424;2124;This is exactly why Superheroes have developed super.
I:8424;2125;in this film, Director M. n. s. misinterprets the comic book realm .
I:8424;2126;for everyday human life, and subsequently bases his entire film .
I:8424;2127;Instead of the Superhero being 'out there', he opted to make it 'Real Life'.
I:8424;2128;the acting by all is splendidas is the great, eerie musical score!
I:8424;2129;i really enjoed this film even more than the sixth sense!
I:8424;2130;I won't say The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece but it certainly was a incredible work of filmmaking .
I:8424;2131;The movie is beautifully photographed but it's too dark for its own good.
I:8424;2132;Very few people, especially those trapped in the Hollywood machine, may ever make another film as good as The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2133;life equivalent of a comic.
I:8424;2134;This guy is a comic book hero impervious to damage who's going to save the small fry from the evil mastermind?Comparisons to Shyamalan's last film aside, it turns into a well.
I:8424;2135;Shyamalan sets everything up just so, and then lets the ball roll, and it rolls well.
I:8424;2136;But it's still a worthwhile movie, for what it is, that was unfairly bashed by many critics unwilling to see past the Shyamalan mystique.
I:8424;2137;I have to be honest with you.
I:8424;2138;The ending is interesting, the music is nice, but on the whole this could have been a shorter movie.
I:8424;2139;He is the weakest of men.
I:8424;2140;that Elijah believes David could be a real life superhero, straight from the comic books.
I:8424;2141;The rest of the film is about David coming to terms with this at Elijah's prompting and direction.
I:8424;2142;This is a small flaw, but the most rudimentary of all of them, so I included it first.2.
I:8424;2143;This is noticed by a mysterious man named Elijah, who is intrigued by David's strength, since he himself is debilitated.
I:8424;2144;Then David applies his strength to helping people, we still have our surprise ending, etc.
I:8424;2145;Galaxy Quest is a comedy.
I:8424;2146;climactic category, I found it bothersome that in David's very first episode as a superhero he finds himself smack.
I:8424;2147;And then we have the big surprise ending.
I:8424;2148;But it took place in the real world.
I:8424;2149;That kind of got brushed aside.7.
I:8424;2150;For example, David is a security guard.
I:8424;2151;and they are normally proud of that fact.
I:8424;2152;This is the last one, I promise.
I:8424;2153;If you are an insomniac, then you will love this movie.
I:8424;2154;although the last 15 minutes are the best of the whole movie.
I:8424;2155;M. Night Shyamalan has a great ability to take a perfectly normal situation, and add just a touch of the unexplainable, to make an interesting story.
I:8424;2156;bruce Willis does very well as a man coming to terms with his unique situation.
I:8424;2157;Samuel Jackson is appropriately aloof and dramatically offbeat.
I:8424;2158;"But the premise ultimately dooms the picture
I:8424;2159;It takes time to develop, and it's in firm control as it climaxes to an unforgettable scene of realizations and surprising discoveries.
I:8424;2160;good directors control how much the viewers know.
I:8424;2161;In that sense, I felt the commercials and trailers spoiled the fun.
I:8424;2162;That's what matters, and when a movie goes beyond simple enertainment to actually talking to viewers, that's when you know a movie is good.
I:8424;2163;classic movie in the same vein as the original Highlander.
I:8424;2164;much of the film simply focuses on the main star's realization.
I:8424;2165;office performance, I'm giving it 4.
I:8424;2166;"again to compare to Highlander, if you have seen that film, figure it this way: McLeoad learns he's immortal and goes through his training, and has one minor skirmish before it ends 
I:8424;2167;All I have to say is that the movie builds up beautifully, I liked the direction that it was heading in, great camera work, and the climactic action scene (for lack of a better term) was done great.
I:8424;2168;Bruce Willis has earned my deep admiration and respect because he deliberately challenges himself with movie roles that avoid the hollywood fomula and focuses instead on much more challenging and riskier projects.
I:8424;2169;This is good for us all: for every Die Hard , there is a 12 Monkeys .
I:8424;2170;unbreakable is one of his experiments that works for me.
I:8424;2171;I enjoyed the movie tremedously.
I:8424;2172;i liked this movie a lot, and so did my wife which surpised me as this type of movie is not her favorite .
I:8424;2173;After M. Night Shyamalan's huge hit The Sixth Sense, he could do anything he wanted.
I:8424;2174;A ton of extras including Comic Books and Superheroes with Jackson.
I:8424;2175;I remember when Miller's Dark Knight and Moore's Watchmen shook up expectations of what such stories could be.
I:8424;2176;but it was a fresh take on what a superhero story could be.
I:8424;2177;Absolutely fantastic casting, Samuel L. Jackson for once playing a role that is not at all his usual fare, and doing it extremely well.
I:8424;2178;The interplay between the lead character and his son was well done and interesting (though it goes way over the top at one scene, afterwards they sort of ignore that and it's fun to watch again).
I:8424;2179;bruce Willis really does a fabulous job with his lead part .
I:8424;2180;"I'm a person who's willing to chance shelling out 20 bucks for a movie I've never seen, so I picked up ""Unbreakable"" at the local Blockbuster."
I:8424;2181;I bring it home, pop it in the tray, and kick it on.
I:8424;2182;You see, when I watched it the first time, I was watching it as the follow.
I:8424;2183;The whole superhero angle, while very interesting, only functions as his own unique struggle.
I:8424;2184;"Bruce Willis gives another great measured performance in the vein of ""The Sixth Sense."""
I:8424;2185;And the movie works even better when you think of it as the first in a trilogy, which Bruce Willis confirmed it is.
I:8424;2186;but it always kept my attention.
I:8424;2187;Unbreakable is an intense film.
I:8424;2188;regarding the special features, the deleted scenes are great, and thats about it.
I:8424;2189;The featurette is ok, and the documentary a little bit better, if you are a comics fan.
I:8424;2190;wise, i give it 5 stars.
I:8424;2191;As both a writer and a director, M. Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.
I:8424;2192;and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.
I:8424;2193;"shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings ."
I:8424;2194;it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.
I:8424;2195;Unbreakable, for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end .
I:8424;2196;shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.
I:8424;2197;the world of comic books of all things .
I:8424;2198;robs the film of much of its potential profundity.
I:8424;2199;Even clever visual motifs .
I:8424;2200;Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.
I:8424;2201;"Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in ""The Sixth Sense."""
I:8424;2202;If you even see this movie whether it is just in the box or playing, do yourself a favor and run the other way as fast as you can.
I:8424;2203;"Although Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" perhaps had more chills and more of a classic twist."
I:8424;2204;"I personally think ""Unbreakable"" is his best film."
I:8424;2205;furthermore, this movie has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on screen.
I:8424;2206;Samuel L. Jackson plays a precise and learned art dealer with a special affinity for original classic comic book drawings.
I:8424;2207;His genetic affliction limits the physical activity he can engage in, but his imagination has always been free to entertain strange possibilities.
I:8424;2208;This truly is an original portrayal that could never typecast Jackson.
I:8424;2209;It's what he is that in the end creates the shock of brilliant resolution.
I:8424;2210;"And even if you never had any interest in comic books, you will probably walk away from `Unbreakable"" with a new respect for what Joseph Campbell might call their ""power of myth."
I:8424;2211;I see a lot of the single.
I:8424;2212;The other reviewers on this page did a great job of describing this movie.
I:8424;2213;This is the kind of movie that really makes you want to believe that there is some kind of good in all of us.
I:8424;2214;All you need is courage.
I:8424;2215;Courage and a true desire to help others.
I:8424;2216;All we need to do is look.
I:8424;2217;More importantly, this movie reminds us that each and every one of us can be a hero.
I:8424;2218;All we need to do is care!
I:8424;2219;It's a great story about courage and humanity, and how anyone can make a difference!
I:8424;2220;I also enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes, and the little documentaries on the subject matter that makes up Unbreakable .
I:8424;2221;The performances are solid and the ending (while being somewhat abrupt, and being a major punching bag in the negative reviews of this film) works just fine.
I:8424;2222;It's a flawed, but impressive film nonetheless.
I:8424;2223;He is truly an artist, and his screenplays are incredible.
I:8424;2224;This is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever watched.
I:8424;2225;If you enjoy movies that impact you after the movie is over, and have you thinking about them the next day.you'll love UNBREAKABLE.
I:8424;2226;Its one of the few in my collection that I can go back to time and again and really enjoy watching.
I:8424;2227;the acting is excellent, the editing flows very well and the cinematography is great.
I:8424;2228;Take comics and strip away the leotards, capes and unbelievable super powers and you end up with people who are amazing for believeable powers .
I:8424;2229;This concept is put into great contrast with the two main characters.
I:8424;2230;But it remains an excellent story that is well told.
I:8424;2231;Amazingly directed, acted, and just plain awesome.
I:8424;2232;The ending of this film is classic.
I:8424;2233;The best comic book movie ever, that was not even based on a comic.
I:8424;2234;page analysis of the adaptation of comic book tropes into film in what I consider M. Night's best work.
I:8424;2235;It is highly entertaining, in my opinion, but from a film criticism perspective, purely analytically, this is masterfully handled in nearly every way a film can be.
I:8424;2236;Due to the excellent cinematography and vivid visuals (color.
I:8424;2237;The reason Unbreakable has received so many put.
I:8424;2238;This is a little understandable, since both have the same lead and director.
I:8424;2239;has brought a welcome return to the kind of unique, avante.
I:8424;2240;garde directing that Hitchcock and Kubrick used to do.
I:8424;2241;The acting and screenplay are still top.
I:8424;2242;notch, but at last the director deserves the best billing.
I:8424;2243;I hope you like it as much as I did.
I:8424;2244;review (with spoilers): It is a rare thing to come across anything NEW in either the thriller OR superhero genres.
I:8424;2245;This combination of both manages to do so for both.
I:8424;2246;Elijah (played as an adult by Samuel L. Jackson) is clearly somewhat nuts, yet there is a wierd and compelling power about him, and about the faith he has that there is a higher power motivating these events.
I:8424;2247;There IS a special power in David, one specifically there for finding those of true evil intent, and he truly does have a strong drive to act on it.
I:8424;2248;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8424;2249;Its the first movie that you cant say anything about without ruining it you just have to see it.
I:8424;2250;Its the best of its kind.
I:8424;2251;It is a very subtle film and I think that is what makes it so great.
I:8424;2252;The twist at the end is as good and as satisfying as the ones in the Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.
I:8424;2253;Like those films it is very interesting to watch the film over and over to catch all the clues to the twist.
I:8424;2254;Immensely enjoyable, tightly presented, and even the edits are sensible.
I:8424;2255;most of the action seems to be about Willis's characters journey, however, in a very sudden twist, we discover that this is a journey of a dualistic kind.
I:8424;2256;in many respects this is a reductionist version of a superhero style story.
I:8424;2257;however you view it, this film will leave you with some degree of impact, and you will undoubtedly take sides.
I:8424;2258;It is absolutely brilliant escapism.
I:8424;2259;This is M. Night Shyamalan (Director) at his best.
I:8424;2260;At once calm yet exciting.
I:8424;2261;A suspenseful thriller that is bound to satisfy any lover of movies beyond generic blockbusters.
I:8424;2262;Highly recommended to true movie lovers.
I:8424;2263;In a time of Marvel movie madness, I still think to this day the best superhero movie is Unbreakable.
I:8424;2264;villians always are stereotyped into always wanting to take over the world.
I:8424;2265;i find this to be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie.
I:8424;2266;I totally recommend this movie for anyone that are big fans of drama or suspense.
I:8424;2267;"this is certainly not a ""superhero"" flick in the sense that _Spider."
I:8424;2268;This movie makes you wonder if people realize the power everyone has to influence other people's lives.
I:8424;2269;Go see this movie and get inspired to help others.
I:8424;2270;Unbreakable is more creative and original than the Sixth Sense, and it deserves to be recognized as that.
I:8424;2271;The rest of this review is for Alex Udvary (he reviewed Unbreakable and gave it 1/5 stars) Unbreakable is a drama, it may be boring to some, but to others a movie about a real life super hero is a great idea.
I:8424;2272;I'm a 19 year old male who read comics growing up and while I am still developing as a man I still read comics and when I found out Bruce Willis was a superhero and Samuel L. Jackson was a super villian that was amazing.
I:8424;2273;You must view movies with more pure eyes then the rest of us.
I:8424;2274;Otherwise Unbreakable is dark, brooding, and amazing.
I:8424;2275;It is a great first film in a trilogy, if there is to be one.
I:8424;2276;Unbreakable was a great, great film.
I:8424;2277;He meets Elijah, who explains that certain people are made to help others with their ability to survive.
I:8424;2278;what this means is that even the most normal person is unique and can be a hero.
I:8424;2279;hopefully with this in mind you will realixe this movie is great and if you, the average movie viewer, watch it carefully and with patience, you will understand it and appreciate it for what it is and what it says.
I:8424;2280;From the reviews that are written here you will notice the people that loved it, and the people that absolutely hated it.
I:8424;2281;thats fine but please quit comparing it to the Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2282;From the start Willis delivers a great performance, and teamed with Sam L. Jackson it just makes it better.
I:8424;2283;In your part you will be at least giving this movie a chance to enjoy.
I:8424;2284;A great movie if you like a strange mystery, acting looked real life, the plot was good, comic books are cool, and with good acters, how can you beat it?
I:8424;2285;In usual M. Night Shyamalan fashion, this film is riddled with meaningful details, unspoken plot development, a deep sense of care for the characters, good thought out dialogue, and touches on another life question: what is my role here on earth?
I:8424;2286;It made me root for the characters and struck the chord of justice, purpose, and hope.
I:8424;2287;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both gave stellar performances in the primary roles.
I:8424;2288;Jackson, a man who is very easily hurt physically.
I:8424;2289;The film has some childhood flashback scenes for both characters as well as modern.
I:8424;2290;day scenes in which they come to understand why they are, well, as they are.
I:8424;2291;The slow pace and quiet tone of this movie work wonders in contrast to the over the top premise, a concept that could otherwise so easily come across as campy is made very real for us as viewers.
I:8424;2292;"the plot is fascinating, particularly to comic book buffs
I:8424;2293;This movie was very original and i will give it that much credit.
I:8424;2294;the first hour and a half: momentum builds impressively, intriguing direction.
I:8424;2295;Shyamalan himself said these scripts were basically stories in the Twilight Zone vein, and he has succeeded well in both films.
I:8424;2296;Unbreakable has excellent character development, and while there is some supposed emptyness in places, it may have been intentional.
I:8424;2297;the resolution of the movie really brings the whole concept into full focus.
I:8424;2298;This is definitely a film worth looking into.
I:8424;2299;It was entertaining from the very first scene and it only got better, and the twist at the end, well that made it a classic.
I:8424;2300;"The acting in it is superb
I:8424;2301;that comic books are a contemporary way to pass on history (like egyptian hieroglyphics) and hold basic truths about mankind that are hidden in layers of colorful pages depicting extraordinary characters.
I:8424;2302;The reason WHY comics are special needed to be emphasized more.
I:8424;2303;the reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because I believe that M. Night Shyamalan makes good films.
I:8424;2304;Movies move us, and we can feel when a movie fiddles with the strings of our emotions (whether it be fear inspired by the horror film or joy from a love story, etc.) This movie, despite my problems with the plot, still manages to move and allows the viewer to feel something.
I:8424;2305;I love this movie, because of the premise, because of the characters and because of the themes.
I:8424;2306;But in the end he is a hero.
I:8424;2307;J. Night Shyamalan has made yet another cerebral thriller and this time its super heroes.
I:8424;2308;What comes out is a seriously cool adaptation to a theme that just about every one of us has imagined at least one time in our lives.
I:8424;2309;The beauty of the movie is slowly learning what the heck is going on.
I:8424;2310;The story is done really well in this aspect.
I:8424;2311;You get really swept away in this trek to find the truth.
I:8424;2312;Many of the scenes use color, sound and other cinematography techniques to bring out an even greater artistic enhancement of storytelling.
I:8424;2313;These techniques almost make you feel like you are seeing techniques used in comic books to enhance the story in a subtle and realistic way.
I:8424;2314;Very, very nice!The acting is superb.
I:8424;2315;When he is needed to show strength you see the inner strength.
I:8424;2316;When he needed to be a vulnerable character you can see it in his eyes and the way he carries himself.
I:8424;2317;Samuel L. Jackson plays his role as Elijah Price so well that you almost think Jackson himself is the infinitely frail.
I:8424;2318;He also has a great presence and complexity that further makes him perfect for the role.
I:8424;2319;Unbreakable is, however, an excellent coming.
I:8424;2320;age type story with one doozy of a surprise ending.
I:8424;2321;Anybody who likes to see more depth in his or her heroes you won't see anything better on any superhero movie hands down.
I:8424;2322;ray is PCM 5.1 lossless and it's really nice.
I:8424;2323;comic Books and Superheroes .
I:8424;2324;A cool analysis of comic book heroes and villans.
I:8424;2325;Shows that Samuel Jackson does have a love for the genre.
I:8424;2326;There are some really cool scenes that were taken out and now you get to enjoy them.
I:8424;2327;Uses the multiple angles feature to switch between the movie and the storyboards.
I:8424;2328;One a Shyamalan's home movies depicting the title sequence.
I:8424;2329;Just shows the budding directory building his chops as a teen with a camcorder.
I:8424;2330;Interesting bit of historic trivia, but nothing to write home about.
I:8424;2331;ray really stood out on the visual end, but it did look really good.
I:8424;2332;I keep wondering if a new and improved Blu.
I:8424;2333;"nominated masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense""."
I:8424;2334;Elijah suffers from a rare genetic disorder, one that severely depletes his bone density .
I:8424;2335;Elijah is intrigued and contacts David, bringing to light his inconceivable immunity to bodily harm and insisting that there is an underlying reason for his divine existence.
I:8424;2336;"Everyone seems to love that film more (God only knows why), but ""Unbreakable"", in my opinion, was a pretty clever piece of work."
I:8424;2337;For those who thought this movie had any inclination of brilliance, stop right there!
I:8424;2338;I too went into this movie with a subtle hope that what I was about to watch was something brilliant and effective.
I:8424;2339;The rest of the film takes you through a series of melancholy self.
I:8424;2340;discoveries of two characters that somehow balance each other based on their abilities to defy all odds of probability.
I:8424;2341;thought, showing commentary of both characters' success and demise.
I:8424;2342;This attracts the attention of a comic book historian, of all things, who has a most unusual theory on why this one man was able to escape even the slightest injury.
I:8424;2343;This historian, briliantly played by Samuel L. Jackson, has reasoned out a theory that seems very reasonable, and very very familiar to me personally.
I:8424;2344;great performances by the whole cast, tremendous suspense, thought.
I:8424;2345;"provoking, groundbeakingly innovative, ""Unbreakable"" is Willis's best, and possibly M. Night Shymalan's best as well."
I:8424;2346;"Possibly Jackson's best along with ""Star Wars"", although he didn't play as large a role in those movies (and to be honest, there's still a couple of excellent."
I:8424;2347;"New Avengers: Breakout, ""Incredible Hulk: Return Of The Monster"" (well, right to the heart of one of the Hulk's many incarnations anyway), ""Astonishing X. men: Gifted"" and ""Amazing Spider."
I:8424;2348;both thought the film was brilliant and lauded it with praise.
I:8424;2349;unbreakable is a wonderful ride.
I:8424;2350;As a begining to a possible trilogy of films it is a magnificent introduction to the principal characters and gives great insight to their lives and beliefs.
I:8424;2351;Most people here in the real world take what they do have and make the best of it and try to do good.
I:8424;2352;shyamalan uses color well as a symbol here as is becoming his trademark.
I:8424;2353;He also seems to enjoy filling most of his frames with lots of background action, choosing to shoot a lot at train stations and sporting events.
I:8424;2354;This lends a lot of power to a simple two shot when he uses one.
I:8424;2355;Especially when Willis and Jackson share the screen.
I:8424;2356;If you watch this film with no previous knowledge of Shyamalan's previous work you will undoubtedly enjoy the film, especially if you are a comic geek who goes in for Frank Miller.
I:8424;2357;Wait until you can see this movie and evaluate it on it's own strengths.
I:8424;2358;I've spent many an occasion arguing the merits of this beautifully crafted film with it's many detractors.
I:8424;2359;bruce Willis has never been better and Samuel L. Jackson is a revelation.
I:8424;2360;By all accounts, this movie is an interesting character study more than it is an adventure film.
I:8424;2361;Comparing the weakest body to the invulnerable body and the psychological problems that go with both sides.
I:8424;2362;Overall, though, it's quite enjoyable.
I:8424;2363;Good for people of all ages.
I:8424;2364;It has a great storyline, dizzying cinematography, and great acting by Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Spencer Treat Clarke and Robin Wright Penn.
I:8424;2365;"a featurette on comic books and superheroes, and
I:8424;2366;"This ""take"" on how the comicbook superhero myth might happen for real was completely enjoyable for me."
I:8424;2367;it's a great product of many minds, writers and film techs, who obviously love comicbook superheros and were on fire to tell this story and would not compromise.
I:8424;2368;I can imagine the drooling studio execs who wanted to 'redo' it and make it more commercial.
I:8424;2369;With his wonderfully original and perfectly structured screenplay, this young master once again has us entirely in his thrall.
I:8424;2370;But it's the beautifully understated performances from Willis, Wright and Jackson which really make this work.
I:8424;2371;Slick production design, thoughtful camera work and editing, and a surprisingly effective score from James Newtown Howard, add the final touches to what is a very, very impressive piece of work.
I:8424;2372;He has another obsession as well: he wants to locate a real superhero, for he believes at least one demigod walks among the human race.
I:8424;2373;"el
I:8424;2374;The conclusion is sinister in its revelations.
I:8424;2375;"The primary directive of the piece is wish fulfillment, a desire to take the phrase science fiction and truncate the latter term, to convert fantasy into reality, to make the dreams of a child as tangible and reproducible as a chemistry experiment
I:8424;2376;"But we're probably not destined to land on every moon
I:8424;2377;Still, it is worth a viewing.
I:8424;2378;One last note: it surpasses the attempts of Signs at allegorical fable.
I:8424;2379;This film puts a very unique spin on the comic superhero genre.
I:8424;2380;I just watched it for the second time and felt the director was still finding his way when you compare this to Signs and The Sixth Sense, yet this earlier movie still delivers.
I:8424;2381;Willis and Jackson are great in this .
I:8424;2382;Jackson seemingly born for the role and the creepy edge he brings to the part.
I:8424;2383;A worthy addition to your library and one that must be watched with your son (providing you follow with some discussion on the differences in good and evil).
I:8424;2384;Many of the scenes with Mr. Glass start by us seeing him through a reflection of through a glass window.
I:8424;2385;And then there's the whole comic book aspect of the movie.
I:8424;2386;making, great cinematography, or just a good old comic.
I:8424;2387;book movie, this is a must see.
I:8424;2388;core film fan, a must.
I:8424;2389;It's a fantastic film !!!
I:8424;2390;A very good story with good actors.
I:8424;2391;M. Night Shyamalan, who some call the next Steven Spielberg, got very lucky when his first big movie, The Sixth Sense, did as well as it did.
I:8424;2392;Chilling, than surprising audiences with it's original plot and breathtaking ending, it became the golden child.
I:8424;2393;Was it as good as The Sixth Sense?
I:8424;2394;The plot is great, the script is fine, most of the acting is good, some is terrific (Samuel L. Jackson is tremendous) there's really nothing seriously wrong with this movie.
I:8424;2395;but in all fairness, I'll tell you what is.
I:8424;2396;all this contrasts interestingly with the family aspect of the movie.
I:8424;2397;Forget, The Sixth Sense while watching this movie, it'll make it easier to enjoy because it is enjoyable.
I:8424;2398;After seeing Bruce in M. Knight's first movie The Sixth Sense I was expecting another really great movie.
I:8424;2399;While this movie isn't as good as The Sixth Sense I must admit that I liked it better the second and third time I watched it.
I:8424;2400;This is definitley a solid supernatural thriller, however I believe it has quite a few weak points.
I:8424;2401;Jackson does his charachter very well, as does Willis, and this film does have its interesting moments.
I:8424;2402;I feel it weakens on the way it tells its story.
I:8424;2403;And yes, this film AFFECTS you.
I:8424;2404;This is an incredible film Hitchcock would praise and profess jealousy.
I:8424;2405;Willis portrays the same sort of character as his role in the Sixth Sense: a character with depth, feelings, and a certain talent I shall not name.
I:8424;2406;The soundtrack takes you by the nose and shoves your emotions in the right directions.
I:8424;2407;The camerawork takes you by the hand, and shows you what it wants you to see (I don't want to spoil this for you, but remember how the color red was so important in Sixth Sense?)
I:8424;2408;He has earned a true fan of his movies (now 2, and both of them damn near brought me to tears), and anyone who watches his films and cannot feel the empathy they exude, needs to go back to pumping gas at the local Exxon in Nobuttocks Utah.
I:8424;2409;You will watch this movie, you will NOT get up to hit the john, and you will understand the true meaning of cinemagraphic momentum.
I:8424;2410;Word is, this is the first of a trilogy.
I:8424;2411;But Willis was believable and it was interesting to watch his development into a sort of superhero.
I:8424;2412;samuel L. Jackson has an interesting monologue about how comic books are a type of historical record that I enjoyed.
I:8424;2413;I hadn't ever thought of comic books in that fashion.
I:8424;2414;Beyond that Jackson is a sometimes creepy, sometimes sad character, but a very important one.
I:8424;2415;Samuel Jackson is so incredibly intense, while Bruce Willis is incredibly understated.
I:8424;2416;Watch it with an open mind .
I:8424;2417;And again, I watched Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2418;film tale of the superhero, few hit the mark.
I:8424;2419;Burton's Batman is arguably the best of the bunch, with Raimi's Spiderman coming in a distant second.
I:8424;2420;Shyamalan has created an amazingly detailed and wonderfully slow.
I:8424;2421;As it is, I think this is Shyamalan's best film.
I:8424;2422;Sam Jackson's portrayal of 'Mr. Glass' is quite powerful, he gets you to feel sorry for him before you find out the truth about his condition and why he is so interested in David Dun (Willis).
I:8424;2423;time favorites and I love the fantastic camera work in this picture.
I:8424;2424;But for those of you who digs them as much as I do, please dive right in!
I:8424;2425;(No pun intended) A great film that has strong performances from all involved and gives the viewer that fantastic jaw.
I:8424;2426;Good movie, worth at least a viewing.
I:8424;2427;i write this article after having seen the film for a third time and knowing that it is nothing less that a masterpiece.
I:8424;2428;Here I present some of the factors that led me to this conclusion:.
I:8424;2429;Both of them are what make the movie unique and even though a good script can boost the actor's performance no.
I:8424;2430;Its the real superhero kinda of guy that really exists!
I:8424;2431;The facts are presented so well that you only have to be mind opened to accept what the writer wants to tell in his film.
I:8424;2432;Nobody has done it before.
I:8424;2433;Watch it closely, and marvel each moment as you will surely do if you like mystery films that hide the supernatural.
I:8424;2434;He directs with such flair and emotion that you can't help but be involved in the wonderful storyline, which he himself created.
I:8424;2435;His script is ingenious in that it brings a superhero concept down to earth and exposes it in everyday life.
I:8424;2436;This is yet another masterpiece from master filmmaker M. Night Shayamalan.
I:8424;2437;Go see this one, folks, it's got everything: performances, direction, story, cinematography, music.
I:8424;2438;It is truly one of the best thrillers ever, if not one of the best films ever.
I:8424;2439;up to the astonishing, genre.
I:8424;2440;"defining ""The Sixth Sense"" may not hit the heady heights of its predecessor, but it is still an intriguing film."
I:8424;2441;"Bruce Willis (returning with Shyamalan after his stunning performance in ""The Sixth Sense"") is American everyman David Dunn."
I:8424;2442;human, immune to pain or injury, and constantly pesters him about his history and lifestyle.
I:8424;2443;He also has an uncanny knack of spotting potential trouble.
I:8424;2444;Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves,the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised.
I:8424;2445;Unbreakable never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves to be a tense thriller full of the quasi.
I:8424;2446;supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves.
I:8424;2447;"Not up to par with ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", but certainly worth the gander."
I:8424;2448;This movie, in my mind, is one of a kind.
I:8424;2449;Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson both give great performances.
I:8424;2450;I really liked the ending which manying people also complain about.
I:8424;2451;If you appreciate a lovingly crafted film that lingers in your mind, give this a try.
I:8424;2452;If you can manage to stay awake.
I:8424;2453;I found myself admiring the aesthetic qualities of the bookself next to the TV.
I:8424;2454;"The Sixth Sense is a hard act to follow, but ""Unbreakable"" is a remarkably good film and one of my favorites."
I:8424;2455;if you look at the career of Shyamalan, the similarities to the career of Orson Welles are remarkable.
I:8424;2456;Each started off with a bang, creating truly memorable films.
I:8424;2457;"Granted, ""The Sixth Sense"" is no ""Citizen Kane"", but both are remarkable in their own rites."
I:8424;2458;"Welles will always be remembered for his masterful first film, and some flawed but interesting work throughout his career, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" stands out as a good example."
I:8424;2459;Elijah has a rare disease making his bones brittle.
I:8424;2460;Soon, he begins to wonder and puts himself to various tests.
I:8424;2461;Unbreakable is a very intelligent, well made movie about the myth of superheroes.
I:8424;2462;"Shortly after the film's release, Michael Chabon published ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" and suddenly there were many projects examining the origin of myth and superheroes, giving the ideas entertaining twists and fictionalized roots."
I:8424;2463;It happens in stages, in a more subtle way.
I:8424;2464;there are many layers to every character, giving them depth and interest, making it a joy to watch them.
I:8424;2465;But Elijah has many facets as well.
I:8424;2466;He sells rare comic books and comic book art, something that kept him going through his lonely childhood.
I:8424;2467;He is obsessed with all things `comic book'.
I:8424;2468;this is one of Bruce Willis' best performances to date.
I:8424;2469;As David, he is a quiet man, unsure of his status in life at any point.
I:8424;2470;This is a very emotional scene because everyone is scared.
I:8424;2471;we meet Elijah, right after he is born, and learn of his condition.
I:8424;2472;shyamalan does a masterful job with much of the film, letting scenes play out, letting them go to places we might not expect.
I:8424;2473;There are many scenes involving David and his family and many may ask why it is necessary to have to watch this.
I:8424;2474;As he deals with his job, we learn about events in his past, revealing a lifelong reticence to create or attract attention.
I:8424;2475;one particularly impressive scene happens late in the film.
I:8424;2476;"As he brushes against people, he is able to sense something about them
I:8424;2477;This scene is masterful because it contains almost no dialogue, yet we always understand what is going on.
I:8424;2478;It is also suspenseful and well done.
I:8424;2479;Joseph starts to cry because he is both proud of his Dad and happy to see that he was right.
I:8424;2480;shyamalan also introduces us to Elijah very early and lets us see some key moments in his life, developing the character even further.
I:8424;2481;The obsession with comic books, his belief in human super heroes, and his disease will all make sense in the end.
I:8424;2482;Unbreakable is a film I think about often.
I:8424;2483;The performances are powerful, the story is interesting and believable and the production values are top notch.
I:8424;2484;Anyway, overall the movie itself looks, and sounds great.
I:8424;2485;Unbreakable is a film that starts out wonderfully, then gets more and more lost as it goes.
I:8424;2486;to make superheroes genuinely possible .
I:8424;2487;It almost makes his previous Sixth Sense seem bright and cheery.
I:8424;2488;written and real: no one is the bold and noble hero, no one is the evil.
I:8424;2489;samuel L. Jackson, who is well known for his own tough.
I:8424;2490;Jackson pulls it off wonderfully, emphasizing humor and some charm, traits that are winning when you're physical presence may not be.
I:8424;2491;Dunn's first outing as a superhero is a bit anti.
I:8424;2492;star movie, but it's closer to that than it is to two.
I:8424;2493;I liked the concept of a real.
I:8424;2494;But the simplicity and beautiful shot scenes are what movies are all about.
I:8424;2495;wonderful, Night, you are truly amazing!!!!
I:8424;2496;Unbreakable is the legend of a real life superhero, brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan.
I:8424;2497;The idea is profoundly unique and the cast is great, but I really didn't like how it turned out.
I:8424;2498;If you want to see Bruce play a realistic and memorable character in a film about the fantastic you will love this movie.
I:8424;2499;Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding as a tragic art dealer who specializes in comic art, his character is named Elijah Price and will remind you of the mysterious people Vincent Price portrayed.
I:8424;2500;Perhaps M. night Shylaman was doing an off handed tribute to the late great Vincent.
I:8424;2501;Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark turn in great performances as well.
I:8424;2502;Anyone who collects or is interested in comic book heros will find this movie very good.
I:8424;2503;Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson give great performances as polar opposites of each other.
I:8424;2504;Security Guard David Dunn miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia.
I:8424;2505;First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't.
I:8424;2506;It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence.
I:8424;2507;I recommend this movie to everyone who likes Bruce Willis, M. Night Shyamalan, comic books or just an exciting, suspense.
I:8424;2508;"a seemingly immortal, ""unbreakable"" human being."
I:8424;2509;Boredom and bedtime is really what pops through the mind once you reach the first hours end.
I:8424;2510;This movie was good because of one good reason: It did not try to be more than it was.
I:8424;2511;It was the most realistic unrealistic movie I have seen.
I:8424;2512;super strength and ESP type powers.
I:8424;2513;Over all it is an enjoyable cinematic experience.
I:8424;2514;Samuel L Jackson's character is great and is a breath of fresh air from his usual roles.
I:8424;2515;Personally, I thought it was great.
I:8424;2516;The general public wants to be entertained by comic book movies.
I:8424;2517;Yes, but then a lot of my favorite movies move at a snails pace ( Round Midnight).
I:8424;2518;If you go into it with an open mind, you may come away with something.
I:8424;2519;Unbreakable takes itself extremely seriously, and many people fault it for this, but The Iliad and The Odyssey, to name a couple, also take themselves seriously despite the fantastic occurrences which take place in them, don't they?
I:8424;2520;"Unbreakable is meant to be a modern day myth
I:8424;2521;M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is very rare class of superhero film, trying to be incredibly logical, while also having plenty of absurd moments.
I:8424;2522;This is okay, sense the director's other films have also followed a similar formula.
I:8424;2523;"Soon after he is given a letter from an art gallery, which displays comic book art entitled ""Limited Edition""."
I:8424;2524;Since he spent one third of his life in the hospital he has read many comic books, and takes them to a serious level of philosophy and sub textual meanings, and he believes David to be a real life hero.
I:8424;2525;The audience can tell that this will ultimately end with David accepting the truth and mending relations with his family, and they can also anticipate the typical Syamalan twist ending.Yes, this is a drama with a concept that is hard to take seriously, but Willis and Jackson do take it seriously and that's all that really matters in a movie like Unbreakable, where acting can be the saving grace of the plot's weaknesses.
I:8424;2526;The two leading actors' performances are worth noting, as is the director's keen attention to details, and sense of visual style.
I:8424;2527;The music score is at times rather slow, not really capturing the right emotion for the events taking place on screen and that lessens the power of the film.
I:8424;2528;This film isn't as good as `Signs', or `The Sixth Sense', but fans of Shymalan's other films will certainly accept this one with arms open wide.
I:8424;2529;the best parts for me (as a writer, and a comic reader) came from Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah Price.
I:8424;2530;When he got in character and talked about how grand and important the story.
I:8424;2531;telling history behind comic books I felt completely attached to the character.
I:8424;2532;I grew attached in these moments because I do believe comics are much more than simple stories to amuse children.
I:8424;2533;They are a very important way of communication, and have been for centuries.
I:8424;2534;These, philosophical speeches he gives describing comics, and the art styles characters are drawn in captures the truth behind comics, and I hope if anything people can come out of seeing this film with a greater respect for this age old genre of story.
I:8424;2535;At times this film is incredibly.
I:8424;2536;unbreakable is not as good as `Signs' or `The Sixth Sense' (my personal opinion, so don't get testy if you disagree), but if you DID enjoy those two previously listed films you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.
I:8424;2537;If you only liked `Signs' and `The Sixth Sense' because of their suspense, sci.
I:8424;2538;So well done, Bruce Willis shows subtlety and depth.
I:8424;2539;as good as The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2540;So many well done scenes.
I:8424;2541;Although this film was not as good as The Sixth Sense , it was still a very brave move on M. Night Shyamalan's behalf.
I:8424;2542;He trusts the audience to read between the lines, and in that perspective I think the movie works and the subtle plot twists along the way work up to a great ending.
I:8424;2543;It may have been more phenomenal had it not followed the powerhouse Sixth Sense, but nonetheless it's a great film that won't leave the viewer feeling cheated at the end.
I:8424;2544;I discovered I was thinking about this movie the next day.
I:8424;2545;So they must have done something right.
I:8424;2546;That scene belongs in the Extra Features, Deleted Scenes.
I:8424;2547;This story line would have made a good Outer Limits type show.
I:8424;2548;Also, some of the best scenes can only be found in the deleted scenes section!
I:8424;2549;Not quite as good as the Sixth Sense, but with just as big a payoff, this movie is fantastic!If you love(d) comic books you will LOVE this movie.
I:8424;2550;It is, as Shayamalan's stories so far have been, a very personal, human story set in extraordinary circumstances.
I:8424;2551;i think Bruce Willis has done his best work in this film and The Sixth Sense, also by Shayamalan, stretching himself to be more than just a funny action hero but also a credible dramatic actor.
I:8424;2552;And Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, delightful in his role as the eccentric Elijah Price.
I:8424;2553;James Newton Howard's score is perfect, and sets the mood beautifully in the many dialogue.
I:8424;2554;First of all, I think one must have a certain amount of familiarity with comic books as well as an apperciation of them as an art form to fully enjoy this movie.
I:8424;2555;Make no mistake about it, it is a very clever, very well orchestrated story, with a great surprise ending that blindsides you.
I:8424;2556;Shyamalan has a mastery of leading the audience down one way when we should be looking another.
I:8424;2557;"I love that about this film
I:8424;2558;That is brilliant, engaging film.
I:8424;2559;The cast is superb, with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson giving flawless performances.
I:8424;2560;I think what ultimately turned a lot of people off from the movie is that there are no explosions, no gunfights, there's not even any ghosts (see Sixth Sense), there's just a great thriller that plays more like a greatly woven mystery novel that you can't put down.
I:8424;2561;This was my favorite movie that year.
I:8424;2562;This is a super hero/ nemesis tale with live great performances by Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson.you won't be disappointed.
I:8424;2563;"No flying car crashes or endless chase scenes
I:8424;2564;The trailer gives nothing away (meaning the true theme of the movie).
I:8424;2565;But for those of us that are patient and give the film a chance to play.
I:8424;2566;out, we can enjoy what the writer/director has created for us.
I:8424;2567;There is so much imagery that makes his point.
I:8424;2568;"the raincoat with cape, the brilliant colors worn by the ""villains"", the use of a kryptonite."
I:8424;2569;In this way it is nearly on par with The Sixth Sense.
I:8424;2570;It's also a love story, and, as is typical with Night's masterful storytelling, there are several love relationships being examined: father and son (Dunn and Joseph), mother and son (Elijah and his mother), and husband and wife.
I:8424;2571;Since this is a film about opposites, there are equal glimpses into the workings of good and evil, and the various types and magnitudes of both.
I:8424;2572;i could go on and on about the possible themes treated in this amazing film.
I:8424;2573;The gift turns out to be a comic book, and Elijah's mother tells him that she has bought a bunch of them.
I:8424;2574;So Elijah is rewarded for his virtuous effort of going out into a dangerous world by acquiring access to a fantasy world where heroism and virtue are delineated with vivid clarity.
I:8424;2575;He will see things upside down at another point in the film, and there is a strong thematic purpose behind it, as there is a strong thematic purpose in his interest, even obsession, with comics.
I:8424;2576;It's a huge ethical issue which goes far beyond the parameters of a simple superhero flick.
I:8424;2577;unbreakable is also a study in the struggle for identity and sense of purpose, and in this respect it has something in common with the later film, Lady in the Water.
I:8424;2578;I tried my best to concentrate through all hour and 46 minutes so that I could see another shocking Shyamalan twist ending.
I:8424;2579;I was rewarded: it turned out to be the funniest part.
I:8424;2580;Enjoy it if you see it.
I:8424;2581;I feel that Shyamalan, a big comic book fan himself created this movie simply for all us other comic book fans.
I:8424;2582;The whole story itself seems like it came from a comic book.
I:8424;2583;What I can say is that Shyamalan's style is simply amazing, the film direction was genius and he seemed to give the film more atmosphere than most other films these days.
I:8424;2584;One of my favorite scenes is when Bruce Willis visits the shopping mall and discovers his secret for the first time.
I:8424;2585;Comparing The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable, and this is a fair thing to do as they share several plot and thematic ideas, finds Unbreakable being a sombre but ulitimately positive and affirming film.
I:8424;2586;there is considerable restraint in the acting with good use of body language and facial expression to a somewhat gritty to mildly surreal series of events.
I:8424;2587;samuel Jackson's character is nicely set up through scenes of his birth and childhood.
I:8424;2588;His life also reveals itself by the end of the film.
I:8424;2589;It's dark and brooding look fits the story well.
I:8424;2590;The film is quiet as well which also helps focus on the self descovery theme.
I:8424;2591;the acting is very good, Jackson has a knack for playing unique roles in big budget and modest films as well.
I:8424;2592;For a leading man figure it is refreshing to see him shift to a character actor type of role where he can stretch his acting skills.
I:8424;2593;the shared items with The Sixth Sense are in the surprise ending, road to discovery themes, timeless sense and a host of smaller ideas that make both films similar except for their endings although both deal with coming to terms and being ready.
I:8424;2594;Probably because they are interesting to watch develop.
I:8424;2595;Events unfold and mysteries develop.
I:8424;2596;If you enjoy films that can be viewed many times to pick up on elements missed the first go around then you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.
I:8424;2597;My memory of this movie is that after I had come out of the theatre, I knew this movie reminded me of the Matrix.
I:8424;2598;This is sheer cinematic drama supported by a VERY excellent Bruce Willis.
I:8424;2599;I saw this twice and its been 3.4 years, but I still remember enjoying this movie tremendously, just because of Bruce Willis' controlled, mature performance.
I:8424;2600;Watch it in peace and quiet and you are in for a satisfying experience.
I:8424;2601;I'm a comic book collector, and this movie did not put fanboys in a good light.
I:8424;2602;com Used MarketPlace and you'll see why.
I:8424;2603;If you saw the sixth sense you absolutely had to see this film when it came out,only for the fact that it was written and directed by the same guy M Knight, I was blown away by the story and the wonderful talents of both Bruce Willis and Samuel l. Jackson.
I:8424;2604;was his opposite.You kind of feel the comic world entering the pace slowly and it dominates at the end, kind of like your comic movies with one exception.you can actually feel that these guys are real,from the real world!!
I:8424;2605;i can't even start on the score of this movie (James Newton Howard) brilliant just brilliant.
I:8424;2606;It is the best of M knight's movies yet.
I:8424;2607;I can watch this movie over and over it is so perfectly told.
I:8424;2608;Rather, suspense is created as it should be created, which is from the emotions and actions of the characters.
I:8424;2609;Damn near a completely original movie.
I:8424;2610;The best superhero movie ever made bar none.
I:8424;2611;i always hoped such a movie would be directed someday i really enjoyed the movie its one of the best movies ive seen in recent years.
I:8424;2612;well done to the director for such a creation and bruce willis was simply great.
I:8424;2613;One of M. Night's best movies.
I:8424;2614;If you like M. Night's movies then you will love this one.
I:8424;2615;"In the canon of M. Night Shyamalan, movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and even ""Lady in the Water"" (provided you view it with the right perspective) can be enjoyed again and again."
I:8424;2616;bending experience worthy of M. Night.
I:8424;2617;"After meeting with eccentric comic book dealer ""Mr. Glass"" (Samuel L. Jackson), David begins to question whether or not that train wreck survival was a ""miracle"" at all."
I:8424;2618;this film is typical M. Night fare in that it weaves a great mystery and gets you thinking all the way through.
I:8424;2619;about the only bad thing I have to say about this film is that it is only truly remarkable on the first viewing.
I:8424;2620;"overall, ""Unbreakable"" is a fine film that showcases the M. Night mysterious style of film."
I:8424;2621;If you are in the mood for a great mind.
I:8424;2622;bending mystery and haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat.
I:8424;2623;Usually, I enjoy any movie with Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8424;2624;This movie is the best sci.
I:8424;2625;fi drama I've ever seen.
I:8424;2626;M. Night Shamalan does it again with such great direction and an original story line.
I:8424;2627;Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver very powerful performances, so it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen.
I:8424;2628;Like Shamalan's other films this one leaves you in suspense throughout the entire film, and has a surprise ending.
I:8424;2629;What a wonderful premise .
I:8424;2630;a superhero among us, one who cannot be hurt provided he avoids his personal kryptonite .
I:8424;2631;discovery, Unbreakable begins with great promise.
I:8424;2632;This movie is a true work of art, but there are some works of art that I don't particularly want to display permanently in my home.
I:8424;2633;Anyone who appreciates beautiful camera work,subtle and dark shots that move gracefully with each scene, and a deep thought.
I:8424;2634;provoking story accompanied with simple yet genuinely intense acting, will tremondously enjoy this movie and give credence to the director's distinguished talent and brilliance to the art of movie making.
I:8424;2635;true, the film was a bit slow, but i would have lived with that had the ending held up it's promise.
I:8424;2636;what you get, instead, is a psychological film that totally ignores the biggest and most important psychological point .
I:8424;2637;what is impact of a traumatic discovery.
I:8424;2638;But I can honestly say that I was dissapointed.
I:8424;2639;when Bruce Willis finally pulled a Neo and had faith in himself the movie downplayed it so much.
I:8424;2640;This is more of a movie that shows a personal struggle emotionally and physically in the characters.
