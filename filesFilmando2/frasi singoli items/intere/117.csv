id;spiegazione
1;A couple years ago I was staying with family that has digital cable.
2;ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple.
3;And I made a point to tell friends.
4;It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie.
5;seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors.
6;I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree.
7;I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.
8;i'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for Best Picture that year.
9;Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director.
10;ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films.
11;The tribute below is touching and I think perfectly articulates what so many have thought and felt.
12;___________________________________________________________________Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle.
13;He seems to tear it from his insides.
14;rare is the performance that can honestly be called a revelation, but that's what it felt like to watch Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.
15;the astonishing revelation of a suddenly, fully developed actor whose juvenile efforts scarcely hinted he'd be capable of such moving depth and clarity.
16;only two years after he received his first Oscar nomination for this iconic, star.
17;outstanding film critic Jim Emerson.
18;that said: gosh, I love it
19;but it plucked a strong chord with me.
20;in any event I can't deny that I loved it.
21;Without a doubt it is the most beautifully crafted film I have seen (It's reasonable to say I haven't seen that many good movies).
22;The story is artfully told.
23;You really saw the torment he put himself through trying to deny his love for Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and present an honest, straight, normal persona to his world.
24;The acting and direction is so spectacular that you see all the emotion and unspoken words play across each character as clear as if it was spoon.
25;wrenching tale of unspoken love, denial and human struggle for personal acceptance.
26;It's wonderful and deserves all it's praise for being what it is.
27;The best word for it is 'Honest'.
28;the stories is about Heath and Jake's characters over a certain time period.
29;the story jumps to Heath and he has a daughter who is practically the same age as he is in the movie.
30;This is a superbly haunting film, one so affecting that I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about it.
31;Beautifully acted, directed, scored, shot, located and heart.
32;wrenching, Brokeback Mountain is likely the Best Picture of 2005.
33;He uses the contrasts of stunning wide open space and isolation, physical and internal isolation.
34;The attempt to mask and repress the heart with tradition, denying the rebel.
35;There is also much metaphor to express the opposing natures of men and women.
36;Ennis is the romantic and the pragmatic of the two, and tortured by a true love he can't accept.
37;While Jack is the flamboyant and hopeful one, who's sexuality he learns to embrace.
38;Director Ang Lee eases into a topic as touchy as Iraq with a gentle approach.
39;A 60s setting, some gorgeous scenery, a methodical, patient pace, yet half way through the movie, you realize that not only are you watching two guys kissing (when was the last time you saw that?
40;Girls: it takes a real man to see this movie.
41;Despite all of these political and sexual asides, this is an awesome movie.
42;unpronounceable do a wonderful job.
43;There is more emotion here than Crash.
44;This was the best movie of the year.
45;, this movie makes it real, tangible, tender and poignant.
46;It is story writing, telling and acting at its best.
47;If you like Unforgiven or Million Dollar Baby, you will like this movie.
48;Glorious cinematography, exceptional score plus spare, first rate screenplay add up to a remarkable film.
49;A milestone film that packs a wallop.
50;My title gives you a hint of what you will feel after seeing this movie for the first time.
51;Watch it again and you will notice things you didn't see the first time.
52;Again, please watch it and cherish those you love and rejoice in the fact you can be with them.
53;Truly, truly, truly: this is a fine, a superb, and a great movie to watch with your friends, your loved ones, your spouse or partner, or by yourself.
54;Truly, the scenery is spectacular, and the story moves along at a nice pace, just like a good horse .
55;or so I believe would be true with a good horse.
56;LOVE is the theme, the core, and the basis for an exploration of humanity and what can or cannot be accomplished.
57;Truly, truly, I highly recommend this film for everyone, whether you are straight, gay, or otherwise.
58;Wow: this film is a keeper.
59;While Ang Lee films are always artful and beautiful, this particular film was worth the watching for the breathtaking cinematography alone.
60;The romantic landscape is inexorably intertwined with the love story, which is dramatic, poignant and yes, quite romantic.
61;In the changing world of the 1960s, they work hard to remain working cowboys, a life they love.
62;The story spans a period of twenty or so years, depicting the secrecy with which the men, both of whom marry and raise families, must lead double lives.
63;If you have ever had a love that can never be made public or a love never fully realized, you identify with this film.
64;known `The Bridges of Madison County' for the portrayal of a life.
65;But this is the point here, that is why Brokeback Mountain is a great movie.
66;brokeback Mountain is how life it is, how real life is.
67;You have a chance to free yourself, to make love a force of nature, you don't take it, you have to take the consequences.
68;the philosophy of the movie is just great, first class, at the level of the great literature.
69;The important thing about this movie the substance within, the consistence, the groundbreaking attitude of the filmmakers, the great, great attitude of the actors.
70;All I have to say is that you must have patience and an open mind to understand the story and the struggle between these two gay characters, in love with each other .
71;The cinemetography was great and acting dynamite.
72;Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the best made and thoughtout films of its time.
73;For this decade, i believe this film should on that list for best film made.
74;it was timeless and classic.
75;brokeback mountain is an eye opener film to show the public that love is love and that the homophobic sentiments we flame our society ruins love.
76;jake and heath did a great job acting wise and making every secene realistic.
77;i do believe that they should had won best picture and also nominating a love that will never grow old for best song should have also been instead of giving the award to a rap duo.
78;you deserve best picture from every award show this year.
79;This film stays with you, you can't help but think about it, it is that powerful.
80;Heath Ledger is so good in this film that i almost forgot this is the same actor who made his acting debut in 10 things i hate about you.
81;Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as well, i loved him in the good girl and october sky.
82;Their love for each other is so real and passionate, that i believed in this story from the getgo.
83;Two actors pretending to be in love, they sure pulled it off effortlessly.
84;Ang Lee's direction is so beautiful with the sheeps, it looks like a cloud floating in one swing.
85;Gorgeous, intense, and courageous acting is what you will get when you engross yourself in this oscar.
86;I think it should have won best picture but some of the best films of all time never win.
87;Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death.
88;whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way.
89;But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen.
90;I will make a point of seeing it again before it leaves the theaters.
91;Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death.
92;whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way.
93;But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen.
94;I think he did a terrific job.
95;This scene was supposed to be abrupt, and it certainly accomplished the goal.
96;well, you have a recipe for pretty much everything that was in the movie.
97;I feel the depiction of the character, and Ledger's performance of this role, were right on target.
98;I think what some have found disturbing, is the sudden passion, and aggression shown, which is explained above.
99;Michelle Williams on the other hand, did a perfect job.
100;Her portrayal of a confused/angry and fearful (of the truth) wife, was excellent.
101;Simply put, this is the most important American film of the past twenty.
102;It is provocative, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is flawlessly acted, but it is also a movie with a heart, and I defy anyone with the sensitivity of a snail not to be moved by Jack and Ennis' tragic love story.
103;The movie has received its share of criticism, but bear in mind that most of that has come from people who refuse to see the film.
104;It has won fourteen Best Picture awards that I know of, beginning with the Vienna Film Festival Award and including the recent GLAAD Award for best picture.
105;It is a film that will continue to be viewed and studied, both for pleasure and for pure love of cinema for decades to come.
106;one of the great love stories of all time.
107;The short story and the film are indisputable masterpieces.
108;The beauty of this short story turned into a beautiful cinamatic masterpiece has indeed made this important and thoughtful film, forever a landmark movie.
109;it's stunningly true to life portrayal of unexpexted love and it's danger and doom of society's grim mentality for gay men in love, illustrates how thousands of people have to live closeted in tortured despair.
110;Hollywood is famously closeted and scared of such honest tell tales.
111;It's out, it's about and it's still a moving love story.
112;The acting is subtle and superb
113;She may have lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but her work remains powerfully passionate and potent, an essential reminder that love .
114;I'm glad I bought this movie, and I have recommended my friends see it.
115;Ang Lee, you are very good, Heath and Jake are simply AMAZING
116;This is a film for open.
117;Bigots and their ilk should stay away from it.
118;Weeks after seeing it, this film is still haunting me and will continue to do so for as long as I live.
119;In the years since I've seen this film I have held a quiet dislike for it that was hard for me to voice, particularly due to the fact that so many of my friends admire it.
120;It has much to like, I think: the acting, the pacing, the themes, cinematography, great story, etc.
121;when two people love each other, and when that love is a great love, like the one depicted in this film, that love gives courage and enables the lovers to overcome certain obstacles, like fear.
122;I thought, well, if their love is that great and strong, they'll find a way.
123;One of the most common ways of doing so is by going into business.
124;Men in such a partnership can hope to enjoy a high degree of marital closeness, even though they have to be discreet about it.
125;Watching this film, I remember having the expectation that at some point the lovers would go into business together and manage to stay close to each other that way.
126;sacrifice for the social order and a nebulous greater good.
127;You must admit, the characters possessed a great reluctance and fear to upset society.
128;The whole idea of a great love that existed but was not known nor acknowledged by anyone outside of the two lovers, is a concept that is very Asian.
129;the lovers who cannot consummate their love because society forbids it, and that there is something spiritually beautiful in that abnegation of their love.
130;Because the fact is that every single day, human beings have to find ways to subvert the social order in order to snatch some of the rewards of life for themselves, and they are also often successful in doing just that.
131;It is worth noting here that the lovers in the film are not cowboys by mere accident.
132;lovers are real men, and that it is the love between two real men that the story is about.
133;i resent this movie because it represents a great put.
134;This movie shows you that despite what the world thinks is right or wrong, it's about loving someone.
135;That love can survive alot of things.
136;It is very deservant of the attention and nominations it is receiving.
137;Hats off to the two actors in their portral of such a touching story.
138;This is a superb film .
139;rate acting, enthralling simple story without special effects or melodrama.
140;Ang Lee's director award is well.
141;It will be a classic of its kind in 10 years.
142;A nice score or memorable theme song would help attract more audience at the box office .
143;It is a great film as it stands.
144;brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.
145;As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.
146;That's the spirit, Annie!Ledger's performance is haunting
147;Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.
148;Great supporting work by the wives.
149;Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.
150;Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection
151;Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.
152;After a few months of honest reflection I ended the relationship and went on my way to live my life as intended.
153;Just read the above and tell me honestly who really has the agenda.
154;Thank you E. Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and all those with the courage to be involved with this project.
155;Thank you for exposing the truth and wreckage.
156;It is possible to be gay, in love and happy.
157;I see lots of movies that get great reviews and sometimes they're deserved and sometimes not.
158;I admit I didn't immediately see how great this movie was at first.
159;This time the true greatness of the movie really hit me and I cried a lot.
160;I think this is really a rare case where all the stars aligned in terms of story, directing, acting, music, cinematography, etc.
161;When asked what drew Ennis and Jack together, Heath Ledger said in an interview that he felt that Ennis' soul fell in love with another soul, and that soul came in the form of a man.
162;I admit the first time I saw this movie the love between them wasn't so obvious and the first tent scene mostly seemed to come out of nowhere, but after repeated viewings and paying close attention the love is very clear.
163;I hope they release the rest of the score and some of the other music mentioned in the credits.
164;BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is one of the outstanding films of 2005, a year full of outstanding films.
165;The early scenes between the two men are idyllic and gracious, lovely and passionate, and I doubt Wyoming from its mountains to its Big Sky country has ever been better photographed for a film.
166;Jack himself, while riding the rodeo circuit, meets a beautiful and charming young woman whose father happens to be rich
167;**For all its heartbreak, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a lean movie whose stunning vistas are matched only by flawless performances, including not only Ledger and Gyllenhall but Randy Quaid as the men's intolerant boss and Ann Hathaway (she of ELLA ENCHANTED!)
168;The two men roughhouse and nuzzle, skinny.
169;dip and cuddle, and generally show their affection in both tough and tender ways.
170;In other words, they acted like men.
171;Ladies and gents, this is not the action of a peeved youth upset because he needs a new source of nookie
172;this is a movie to recommend not just to people who like good movies but to the occasional soul who asks me or my friends, Why make such a big deal about being gay?
173;Much of the homophobia in this film still exists today, but thank God it isn't still 1963!
174;clearly, this was an Oscar favorite for good reason.
175;Its directing and cinematography are flawless, and the acting could not be better.
176;And if you read the original writing of Annie Proux, you will see that this film stays true to the original story (which any good movie should, when it is based on a writing piece).
177;and Ang Lee did an excellent job of portraying real people, in real life, falling in love.
178;for me, this was the best movie of 2005 even if it lost to Crash for the Oscars.
179;It made a powerful statement about humanity and intolerance that still echoes in our society today.
180;This movie is sure to be a classic, and a must.
181;What a beautiful movie .
182;the scenery, the characters, the love story.
183;It's really sticking with me and I want to watch it again.
184;I highly recommend it, especially to those on the fence about seeing it .
185;Like other reviewers, I found the characters in this film invading my life.
186;but Jake Gyllenhaal also did a superb job portraying his personal difficulty and ambivalence.
187;wins the Oscar for Best Picture Of The Year with such a masterpiece (indeed it's a work of Art) like Brokeback Mountain???
188;Crash is a movie about day life problems!
189;Brokeback Mountain is an intemporal and universal Love story!
190;Brilliantly filmed, played with such a deep meaningfull that you don't see that often in the movies!
191;Brokeback Mountain was a breakthrough in mainstream American cinema.
192;It's the first (relatively) mainstream movie to address gay issues, and to treat a gay romance the same way as a straight one.
193;Unlike Titanic,however,Brokeback brings up important issues,has great depth,and is emotionally moving.
194;There,he meets Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal),and there's a spark between them.
195;For a time,they enjoy a pastoral and amorous idyll.
196;They reunite every summer, their time together bittersweet.
197;Jack carries on an affair with another cowboy,and also has a one night stand with a Mexican prostitute.
198;Anne Hathaway is amazingly sympathetic as Jack's heartbroken wife.
199;the positive aspects of the movie are the performances of the leads,the powerful soundtrack (Gustavo Santoalalla is great),its beautiful scenery.
200;Brokeback Mountain takes on new,poignant resonance in light of Heath Ledger's tragic,untimely death.
201;Ennis was his breakthrough role,showing his promise as a subtle,powerful actor.
202;Spain, the second most roman.
203;Just about anything I can say about this wonderful movie seems woefully superfluous at this point, and yet it seems fair to point out that I'm yet another person taken in by this tragic and touching movie.
204;i'm not usually a big fan of romances and tear.
205;The writing is simply superb, the acting is quite possibly the best I've ever seen, and the plot is both simple and straightforward (forbidden love) while still being incredibly complicated and thought.
206;it's hard to say what I liked most about this movie.
207;i also greatly appreciated the tenderness with which the movie approaches Ennis' wife and her feelings towards her husband's affair.
208;like pretty much everyone else on earth, it seems, I deeply recommend Brokeback Mountain for a tragic and touching tale of love and loss.
209;This is such a great film.
210;Well directed, acted, scored and the cinematography was sensational!
211;It speaks to the human experience.
212;this film will remain forever as one of the greatest pictures ever made.
213;the material in this movie is incredibly compressed, like really good poetry.
214;And also, like good poetry, it gives away more and more and more upon successive viewings.
215;see this movie more than once.
216;MANY TIMES more than once!
217;Other reviewers have already stated, much more eloquently than I could, why this is such a wonderful movie.
218;Very few movies make me care, and that is certainly worth $20.
219;Finally on the big screen a real love story between two men.
220;I grew up in the country and always dreamed of this.
221;I find that it tells the story of Human love and the fact when that love is forbidden how it affects not only the people in love but all those around them.
222;This movie is important to see by as many people as possible because I think it moves you to a place deep within your emotions that people need to fill.
223;The charecters are so inspiring to make you want to do more to better not only yourself and the world around you, but it also has a deeper meaning one I'm still working on exploring.
224;I just want everyone to experience this movie one time.
225;The movie is beautifully shot and very well acted.
226;Heath Ledger's performance was so powerful that I felt his pain of being in love and not being able to realize the relationship fully and openly.
227;At the end of the day, this was a deeply moving love story and the characters just happened to be gay.
228;I encourage people on the fence about seeing this film to take the leap and go and see it and I am certain there will be no disappointment.
229;No doubt Ang Lee is a master of the Tragedy.
230;Ang is the best story.
231;teller around who can actually make us feel for his protaganists.
232;As a student of mass media it is amazing to watch.
233;its what provides us with energy and power.
234;(Sorry folks MUNICH is the best film of the year period.
235;saving Private Ryan kicked Shakespere in Love) It is amazing that not too long ago this very Academy made the Catholic Apologist film A Man for All Seasons and the excellent Chariots of Fire best pictures films.
236;anyways, Brokeback has great cinematogrophy, a great score and good acting.
237;Are we enlightened beings because Will and Grace has something meaningful, wise, and substantive to offer?
238;Its amazing thought to contemplate.
239;That reality is of equal relevance to the reality of homosexuality and deserves an equal amount of respect.
240;Hopefully we can treat each other with respect whilst this experiment which was ignited in the sixities plays out until its bitter end.
241;It will be interesting to watch Hollywood push their little agenda at the oscars.
242;when Munich is the best film of the year.
243;But this movie got to be good, I thought, since everyone loves it.
244;This movie demonstrate true power!
245;You will be deeply moved, emotionally, to the messages this movie conveys, and become magnetized to live out a better existence.
246;Yet, when I went to see Brokeback Mountain last night, I found myself one of the last moviegoers to find a seat in a theatre overflowing with people from all walks of life.
247;For what this movie provides is a heart wrenching tale of two thoroughly complex men, struggling with societal pressures and their desire to be themselves.
248;Ennis rarely speaks, and when he does, his words are simple.
249;Jack, on the other hand, is more outgoing in nature.
250;At this time, his spirit seems playful, yet experienced, making for a sharp contrast with that of Ennis.
251;Both characters marry andestablish families before they meet again.
252;When they find each other four years after their work on Brokeback Mountain, they are instantly drawn together again and establish a relationship where they meet a few times a year, for fishing trips where no fish is ever caught.
253;Their story spans 20 years, culminating in a hauntingly tragic ending.
254;His portrayal of Ennis Del Marr is heartbreaking.
255;With few words, he was able to reveal a array of emotions.
256;In supporting roles, Michelle Williams (as Alma), Anne Hathaway (as Lureen), and Jake Gyllenhaal all do incredible jobs as well, each bringing an intense believability to the roles in which they portrayed.
257;The melancholy nature with which this film concludes, does so, in part because of the exquisite changes each actor brings to their character.
258;This is a movie with heart, compassion and lose.
259;The acting was magnificent, especially Heath Ledger.
260;When he and Jack were first reunited after 4 years, the smile on his face and his excitement at seeing his old fishing buddy was the cutest thing I have ever seen.
261;I had to cross state lines to see this film (community standards prevented it from being played where I live)and the ride, toll, and exorbitant ticket price were all worth it.
262;After seeing that Trash, oh sorry Crash, won the Academy Award for Best Picture I was really dissapointed( Even thought I liked Crash a lot, and thought it was excellent, I still thought that it should have not won Best Picture
263;All of us can relate to this movie more than Crash.
264;Love is everywhere, no matter what.
265;It shows the love between two straight guys who fall in love after working together up at the mountains and since then their love is meant to be.
266;They both have their own families and their own live, but destiny brings them together and their love is once again revived.
267;They maintain their love a secret for years, but we all know that what they wished for, is that their love can be seen.
268;Believe me when I say that their love and sacrifice for each other will touch you deeply.
269;It would make them understand what really love is about and that Love Is A Force Of Nature.
270;The direction is beautiful(Best Director), and the music is very good(Best Score).
271;It is great in every sense.
272;(Best ScreenPlay)The story line, the acting (Nominated Best Supporting Actor, Best Actor, Best Suporting actrees), and the script.
273;21st Century Film Industry probably witnessed a movie that has so much contraversy, and still survived in the minds of the critics.
274;Still, this movie moved every one of its viewers, and taught all of us to become more accepting.
275;This movie also taught us to cherish true love, which can be seen even between these two cowboys.
276;Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.
277;This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.
278;The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty.
279;the film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.
280;This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.
281;That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.
282;what helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.
283;Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.
284;Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.
285;Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.
286;Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.
287;Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co. stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.
288;visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.
289;We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.
290;But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.
291;The opening sequence of the film signifies a beginning of these mens fate.
292;when it comes down to it, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, yet what sets is apart from any other romance is the fact that these two cowboys happen to both be men.
293;By the second encounter with these two men, you can see a change.
294;The contact is more emotional and sensual.
295;But the way that director Ang Lee goes about it, leads to not nausea, but a genuine care for the characters.
296;Just two souls on the same line of fate that matched each other perfect.
297;heath Ledger as Ennis is amazingly well.
298;His emotions are genuine and his gestures are natural.
299;Anne Hathaway as Laureen Newsome, Jack's wife, is ravishing as usual.
300;Her beauty is persevered even as the years pass in the story and the times change.
301;the script adaptation of the novel is transcribed very well from the pages to the big screen.
302;Director Ang Lee does a consistently good job through out the film.
303;The element that captures the touches of Ang Lee are the little things.
304;Ang Lee also does a stellar job of showing both mens point of views throughout the movie.
305;Brokeback Mountain is surely Ang Lee's finest film to date.
306;It is a profound and deeply moving meditation on the nature of love
307;having read Annie Proulx's novella I found it remarkable how the details of her story and the flavour of her writing.
308;all work to build the movie slowly but surely to its heart.
309;throughout the course of the film the landscape comes to symbolise Ennis and Jack's intimacy.
310;their freedom to express their love for each other.
311;heath Ledger is extraordinary in this film.
312;His Ennis is a strong physical and sexual presence, but the way Ledger essays Ennis' inner torment is quite unforgettable.
313;and these are usually the scenes where the depth and intensity of his love for Jack are revealed.
314;When Jack is out of sight Ennis moves to the roadside and sobs uncontrollably, overwhelmed by his emotions, shielding his face with his hat.
315;The potency of this scene is how quickly and efficiently it draws high contrast between the young, high.
316;ang Lee has taken themes in the novella to a whole new level.
317;With his restrained and almost at times austere direction I found that the homosexuality drifted to the back of my mind.
318;Indeed I feel that the films great message is that if you are unable to live the relationships you are supposed to live.
319;jake Gyllenhaal is also superb in this film.
320;He creates a character that lights up the screen in every frame he is in.
321;but time and again I was so moved by the way Jack articulates his love for Ennis.
322;i really enjoyed the way Ennis' eldest daughter was drawn in the film.
323;But only after asking her if 'she really loves Curt'.
324;the film is a draining but totally rewarding experience and it will stay with you long after you've left the cinema.
325;and you will be deeply touched.
326;It is one of the most toching, raw and honest love stories I have ever seen.
327;and it will stay with you long after the movie is over.
328;This has easily become one of my new favorite movies.
329;The acting is done so well.
330;that you feel like you are there with them.
331;It took my breath away.
332;This is love in it's purest form.
333;the feelings, described through those natural elements.
334;brokeback Mountain is the Art of filmmaking, the movie breeds the language of the true American rural people.
335;Ang Lee made a very, very strong connection between emotion and art.
336;This is portrayed very well and very deeply that it carves into your flesh and bone.
337;It is very honest, and I think this movie is something everyone, whether you are straight or gay, can relate to.
338;Jack as he had always been: doey eyes and boyish smile, smoke on one hand and whiskey on the other .
339;i do see splint of light at the end of the movie though.
340;Finally, he was proud of the love Jack gave him.
341;Jack's soul would have found peace from that moment.
342;It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart.
343;But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid.
344;this film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close.
345;It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy.
346;Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person.
347;And I'd say it's made for the sensitive.
348;Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure.
349;If you liked his The Ice Storm and you are not homophobic, you'll apprehend this film.
350;THIS is a masterpiece!The music is astounding.
351;I bought the soundtrack first because I love Gustavo Santaolalla music .
352;incredibly poetic guitar chords that enhances the movie for a higher ground.
353;I was touched in so many ways by this movie that I could not believe myself.
354;just remember how good is 'The Ice Storm' .
355;to the unforgettable final scene, this movie delivers art in every image, in every scene, in every sequence.
356;Wether in the mountain, in a bar or in the character's houses, everything is perfect.
357;heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall and Michelle Williams (and also Linda Cardellini and Anne Hathaway) are truly amazing!
358;Heath's performance is absolutely mesmerising, memorable and magnificent.
359;i have never seen before a love story so beautifully told, filmed and played.
360;please meet Ennis and Jack.
361;And watch this movie with your heart.
362;Brokeback Mountain will long be remembered as the first hugely acclaimed mainstream movie dealing with a same.
363;Her female viewpoint on the world shows very clearly in both main male characters.
364;fetched for a lot of viewers personally, the film is made with excellent craft and deeply human overtones, which make it more believable and psychologically real.
365;I found myself thinking and reflecting on the movie and its characters the next day after watching it.
366;i found this a beautifully written, acted, directed and photographed film filled with subtlety and understanding.
367;A compassionate study of an illicit love in a time and place of great repression, the movie walked a knife.
368;i applaud the great courage of the two young leads who have been justly praised for their performances.
369;It looks good now, but it had a tremendous possibility for not only failure but also humiliation, and I recognize their risk.
370;And the specificity of the time and place is everything.
371;i enjoyed the film as a specific story, like any other story.
372;The great craft involved allowed me to accept these characters and to eventually care about them, but I found no need to extrapolate beyond that to any great generalities.
373;I've read the book and watched the film and I must say that Brokeback Mountain is an excellent film, well.
374;made, beautifully directed with a haunting soundtrack and the perfect cast!
375;Both Heath and Jake have an amazing chemistry on screen!In a nutshell, Brokeback Mountain is a bittersweet love story between two individuals, their love story is both tragic and beautiful at the same time.
376;It is about a love that is altogether sweet, complicated, delicate, haunting, unfulfilled, frustrating and devastating.
377;if you are unable to be true to yourself and be with the one you truly love and desire, you may well end up destroying not only your own life but the lives of others around you.
378;highly recommended, however, having an open mind is a must.
379;This film was beautifully shot.
380;I loved the pacing of the film.
381;Really let you feel the emotions and beats of the story.
382;Bravo to the director, bravo to the actors (especially Ledger) bravo to the writers and producers.
383;Brokeback Mountain is one of the best films that I have seen in several years.
384;time great films has a movie captured the love, anguish, fear, disgust and helpless of two people caught in a situation of which they have no control.
385;Brokeback will be discussed for many years to come and in time will find it placed ranked as one of the top ten films produced.
386;It was fully engrossing from start to finish and the performances from Ledger and Gyllenhaal were spellbinding.
387;so why did I see my friends and I in this story?
388;brokeback Mountain, with its vulnerable performances and clear.
389;sighted direction, is about our natural human struggle.
390;I hate that and it made the film so real to me.
391;and that Breaks my heart.
392;I hope the Movie wins all 8, I keep hearing the part with the soft guitars in my head, each and every time the movie wins an Oscar.
393;I felt every tightness that Ennis had in his lungs, in his heart, and in punishing himself for expressing his feelings.
394;My favorite part is where they see each other after 4 years and they are so happy to Be with each other,they kiss unashamed and it's muskrat love!!
395;That is love, gay or straight.
396;I know those feelings of a long awaited distance romance and they did that so well.
397;his  Love that will never grow old even now as tears well in my eyes.
398;Keith Ledger deserves the Oscar, he really worked that character.
399;It will win Best Movie, director, song, and Keith, you worked so hard.
400;it is the narrative of the movie.
401;This movie will stay with me and creates such empiness for me.
402;I've always heard good things about Brokeback Mountain so I always had an interest.
403;This is a movie everyone should see no matter their sexual orientation because it speaks for many causes.
404;There are 3 scenes that are totally captivating, the rest of this movie leaves you yearning for more.
405;The scene that night in the tent when Ennis goes to Jack is mesmerizing!
406;I would recommend that the first time you see this movie, watch it all the way through.
407;The second and third etc times you see it (once is not enough) leave the theatre happy right after that reunion kiss and imagine the way you may or may not have ended this movie yourself.
408;I am a dreamer, so I want to believe that they got that cattle and calf operation and led the sweet life and lived happily ever after!
409;PURPOSE: Validate the conjecture that a happy movie would be sad.
410;gOAL: Show that a happy movie would be sad, using Brokeback Mountain as an example.
411;tHEOREM: Brokeback Mountain is a happy movie.
412;This implies that the movie has invoked happiness or satisfaction within the viewer.
413;This shows that Brokeback Mountain is a happy movie and our proof is complete.
414;rEMARK: The proof of our theorem that Brokeback Mountain is a happy movie only refers to a single viewer.
415;to show that Brokeback Mountain is a happy movie that would be sad, we can use the results of our proofs of the theorem asserting that Brokeback Mountain is a happy movie and the lemma asserting that Brokeback Mountain is a sad movie and combine their resolutions.
416;star reviews that it has received from customers.
417;This validates our conjecture that a happy movie would be sad, using Brokeback Mountain as an example.
418;I just got home from seeing the majestic Brokeback Mountain.
419;Everyone involved in the film is excellent, in fact, flawless.
420;Jake's performance is as good as Heath's.
421;Also Ann Hathaway has an astonishing scene at the end on the phone with Heath's Ennis.
422;The screenplay is amazing and will definetly win the Oscar.
423;All in all, the best picture of the year.
424;Bar none this is the best film of 2005.
425;Anyone who is dealing with unrequited love or a love that they can't have for whatever reason will gain a new perspective of the emotion after watching this film.
426;This film establishes that fact and what is heartbreaking is that many people will see this and condemn it for being a love story between two men.
427;This film should have won the Oscar.
428;it is so meaningful in so many ways.
429;Much better is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist who is magnificent.
430;He tears the heart right out of you.
431;They both play off each other beautifully.
432;A sad pathos is manifested in her performance and she should have received an Oscar for her performance.
433;Everything about this film is top notch and if you are a romantic, then it will leave you breathless at the end.
434;heath Ledgers performance was stunning.
435;It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.
436;There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay.
437;Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on fishing trips and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.
438;That is exactly what's so valuable about it.
439;Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he.
440;I loved this movie so much I went back to see it the next day.
441;The scenery was beautiful and desolate.
442;the movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.
443;there is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about Brokeback Mountain long after it is over.
444;the acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless.
445;One of my favorite movies of all time.
446;Beautifully filmed and poignant love story (not your typical fluff piece).
447;The film is beautiful in every way.
448;Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.
449;This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.
450;It is a love message film.
451;When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.
452;When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.
453;A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.
454;His love is for this man.
455;True love is such a gift and should never be denied.
456;here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.
457;The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.
458;The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.
459;The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.
460;the story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.
461;The blu ray version is astounding.
462;This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.
463;The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.
464;The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.
465;this film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.
466;I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.
467;Highly recommend this amazing film.
468;And it is the onetrue force that all living things respond to.
469;and this is the joyous, yet sad thing about this movie.
470;it's a visually stunning movie.
471;That's brilliantly directed by Ang Lee.
472;and the performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal,are what Oscar awards were created for!Go see this movie.
473;With an both an open heart and open mind!
474;Prouix described how she had wrestled with finishing the tale for years, and had a much harder time with it than she had had with her longer works.
475;(BTW, her book THE SHIPPING NEWS is a brilliant novel and a pretty good movie.)
476;And here is the telling moment: Authors are almost always dissatisfied in some ways with the films of their work, particularly when they are not associated with the movie project as creative consultant or some such.
477;She was absolutely floored that the movie had stayed so true to her story's original tone and purpose, and even substantially expanded upon it.
478;(The fact the adapted screenplay won an Oscar for Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana is a testament to its excellence.)
479;What a story, and what a movie.
480;But it was written by a woman born in Connecticut, filmed in Alberta, and directed by a man from Taiwan.

486;What a story, and what a movie.
487;But it was written by a woman born in Connecticut, filmed in Alberta, and directed by a man from Taiwan.
488;Not only is this movie beautiful, the actors are excellent, but the underlying message is what hit me.
489;this is a vivid account of that quest.
490;after some 756 reviews, one is hard pressed to say something refreshing about this film.
491;Yet, the sheer fact that discussion about BBM is so alive and thought.
492;provoking attests to the greatness of this film as a piece of art.
493;Ang Lee has succeeded in creating something so visceral, so moving, so elusive and infinite in its meanings that twenty years from now, we'll still being try to decipher it.
494;Ennis and Jack's struggle is a universal one, that of loving somebody in the fullest and most elemental sense of the word.
495;That is why this film is for us all, regardless of sexual persuasion.
496;BBM is an epic tale about the costs of loving somebody whom your world, your family and even yourself deems to be unacceptable or just plain 'wrong.
497;As both men move up the mountain, the ball between them starts to roll, picking up momentum with each gorgeous shot of the Canadian Rockies.
498;Ang is the master of the tiny things that speak volumes.
499;And that moment soon comes with one of the most raw and REAL portrayals of homoerotic passion you'll see this side of pornography.
500;While born of the moment, Jack and Ennis' explosion is the culmination of their evolving and very unacknowledged desire for one another.
501;Gyllenhaal's performance is nothing if not amazing.
502;How a straight actor could manage to capture Jack's open yearning for another man so perfectly, so precisely, is simply miraculous.
503;joyful acceptance of the possibility that Brokeback offers.
504;And if you weren't, you'd best keep it to yourself, far in the closet, far from Mr. Kinsey.
505;Falling in love with another cowboy ain't in the scipt and that's what makes Jack and Ennis' love so heroic, so fragile, so ultimately doomed.
506;Their first meeting after their marriages has to be one of the most passionate and tortured film 'kisses,' if that's the word one can use here, you'll ever see.
507;Ledger and Gyllenhaal will leave you in a whirlwind.
508;Alma's look of shock and disbelief as she stares through the glass window at her husband entwined in the arms and lips of another man is just one of the many grand cinematic moments in this film.
509;Alma's face is one of profound confusion.
510;Moreover, Ann Hathaway does a stellar job as Laureen Newsome, Jack's attractive Texas wife, a woman captivated by Twist's bull.
511;Lee's masterful use of the West's untouched natural grandeur is without parallel.
512;A place unfettered by social constraint, tradition, expectation.
513;A place which allows Jack and Ennis to do that which should come most easily, to love.
514;Yet, such freedom comes at a heavy price.
515;As Jack rightly says, 'Brokeback is all we got!'
516;A ranch together, a life together.
517;if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.'
518;And with such stoicism, Ennis nails the lid to both their coffins.
519;Such is the complexity of Ang Lee's art that it defies our natural desire to point the finger at the characters.
520;with Ennis's faintly voiced, 'I swear.,' a great American film closes.
521;More than anything, BBM should be seen and seen again as an example, par excellence, as to what a genius with a camera is capable of creating.
522;Ang Lee's visual poetry, similar to that of another maverick director, Terence Malick, is breathtaking.
523;Reality to one is a fantasy to another, and vice versa.
524;So with respect to other people's reality, that is a fantasy.
525;A powerful and achingly beautiful film.
526;economic levels is as stark as the land.
527;romantic life is for cowboys and farmers.
528;Choosing duty and responsibililty over happiness and love .
529;a universal, and timeless, conflict.
530;THAT is Hollywood, and self.
531;And that is why this movie is so good .
532;But that is why it will stick with you for days and weeks after.
533;see this on the biggest TV you can find, and watch it in widescreen.
534;And if you can see it in a theater, do it .
535;format reinfornces all the key aspects of the film, from the desolation of the land, to the distance between the characters, to the amazing vistas that are the backdrop for most scenes, including the pivitol opening one.
536;I believe he is one of the best actors I've ever seen
537;Since seeing Brokeback, I have seen most of the movies he's done .
538;It's been a cult favorite for years, especially in England.
539;I hope he continues to make the right choices.
540;Heath Ledger is wonderful, of course, but I am much more taken with Gyllenhaal .
541;Gyllenhaal is also a great interview (although he, too, rambles!)
542;
543;After winning the BAFTA (British Oscar equivalent) for Brokeback, he told reporters, I think it's a bit premature, but I'll take it.
544;At a press conference in Toronto for Brokeback, Gyllenhaal described the script as being poetic and beautiful.
545;Half of it is screen direction, with wonderful, detailed paragraphs delineating what the characters are feeling.
546;i'm not only obsessed, but I feel compelled to talk about the film, obviously.
547;This film has touched me in a very deep place, bringing to the surface overwhelming feelings I buried so deeply so long ago I'd forgotten about them.
548;stuff I thought I had dealt with.
549;Brokeback is a love story with insurmountable obstacles, but it's much more than that.
550;All the actresses are excellent.
551;And, the scenery/setting is as important a character as the people.
552;I'll leave you with what a friend, a very smart director, wrote to me:Oddly, I'm tempted to write an analysis of Brokeback Mountain because that film had SO much aesthetic and intellectual content.
553;Yes, Ang Lee's love story is a great movie.
554;It's a hearbreaking, visually stunning Western.
555;It's really well acted, particularly by Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams, brilliantly written, original and incredibly moving.
556;That's what makes the film important.
557;Many people have commented that the film's theme is universal, applicable to all audiences.
558;I felt its impact, its originality.
559;I wanted to learn from it, and I wanted others to see it and learn.
560;The documentary THE CELLULOID CLOSET, released several years ago, showed us Hollywood's history of how it subtly hid yet depicted homosexuality.
561;This is our movie, and it's a great one, a cause for celebration.
562;I watched the movie completely with an open mind.
563;Immediately after watching it, I rated it Good, but VERY sad.
564;I even found it a little sexy in a strange sort of way.
565;I was really grossed out!
566;I realized what I found sexy was that I liked the men in the movie.
567;I will never watch it again, nor will I recommend it to others.
568;Often times, good films will get hyped.
569;up to the max due to word of mouth, and will ultimately dissapoint the audience, because while it may be a good film, it did not live up to their expectations.
570;even with all the hype, Brokeback Mountain aviods this, becoming not only the most heartbreaking and memorable film of the year, but also of this decade.
571;the direction is perfect, what else can be said?
572;Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, as he will likely get it.
573;The scenery alone is worth the price of admission, and I gasped several times just seeing it.
574;the performances will break your heart as well.
575;Who thought Heath Ledger was capable of giving such a powerful performance after his recent movies, but he does.
576;Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, and my personal crush Linda Cardellini also do magnificent jobs.
577;overall, Brokeback Mountain should be seen by everyone
578;She held in her sadness for so long until she exploded on Enis during a holiday dinner.
579;He despised Jack's crusing trips to Mexico.
580;Ennis was loyal to his family and Jack.
581;It's sad, but in the end minus Jack everyone moved on with their lives.
582;The film was well written and well acted.
583;It was touted as a great chick flick, where guys can show their sensitive side afterwards and win points with their dates.
584;Loneliness leads to playful interaction, which leads to sharing a tent, then to sharing body heat, and finally to sharing emotional and then sexual intimacy.
585;Although I thought it was excellent and that Ang Lee had once again captured a place and time so well (and without the usual movie.
586;I feel that this movie needs to be viewed by all individuals who have a pre.
587;such Christians need to practice what they preach and open their minds and hearts to all human beings regardiess of their sexuality.
588;If they view this movie with an open mind, they may have a much better understanding of what love really is, and begin to open their hearts as a good Christian should, based upon their own preachings rather than promoting hatred.
589;Homophobia affects far more than gay men.
590;He and Jack could have been honest about themselves, and lived safely together their entire lives.
591;The familial and societal pressures for men to marry and have children are great.
592;He said to me, Sex with a woman is so wonderful, that once you've experienced it, you'll never think of another man again.
593;Wives forbidding them to see their kids.
594;These people described their experiences, and the education they received about putting your faith in the church leaders as opposed to facing reality.
595;It's a damn good chance neither these men or their wives would have been infected.
596;which is a part of nature and always has been.
597;And ignorance coupled with fear is the very basis of homophobia.
598;All of them could have a happy life.
599;understand what is truly responsible.
600;and to reviewer J. e Barnes, thanks for all the insights about the symbolisms.
601;I caught some of them, but you pointed out others that really make the film even more interesting.
602;Having screened Brokeback Mountain, I exited impacted by the ace acting, hee.
603;haw humor, blue sky cinematography, the Western acoustical score, and the pursuit of certain societal truths, by those translating Annie Proulx's opus into a searing cinematic experience.
604;spirited, and charmingly charismatic in ways you never anticipate.
605;the bigger point is, see the movie with some sense of fair play, because life is never so symmetrically scripted that ponies stay corralled, though the barn door is left unlatched!
606;Both powerful and moving I cant give this film enough praise.
607;A profoundly haunting and powerful film.
608;It is worth seeing for the actors alone.
609;So they underpaid the actors and made Budweiser one of the main characters.
610;It's widely overrated simply because it is about homosexuals.
611;It's a human rights agenda.
612;The film wants us to realize that love and desire do not discriminate.
613;By presenting us with two gay men as leads, the film challenges our ingrained predjudices right off the bat.
614;The genius is that as soon as this beautiful film starts to unspool, we forget that we are watching two gay men.
615;The movie's goal is to change hearts and minds and in order to do that, it has to prove to its viewers that we are all human and victims of our own emotions and desires, regardless of our sexual orienttion.
616;oh, and as for the movie, it's skillfully directed by Ang Lee and the performances are superb.
617;Jake Gylenhall is great as Jack, the man who is more in touch with his needs and desperrately wants a life with Ennis.
618;But it is Ledger, as Ennis, who gives this movie its heart.
619;The actors were great and the story is really good.
620;Watch this movie and open up your mind a litte to other people's struggles.
621;That it would become sexual I knew from the reviews.
622;but I seldom felt much of anything lovable in either one.
623;True, they both worked hard and helped each other.
624;My experience is, that love builds slowly, by baby steps.
625;A pleasing attitude, a caring demeanor, perhaps a small act of compassion observed discretely from afar .
626;these sort of things can trigger an interest.
627;I felt their joy in both scenes.
628;Virtually everything in the book is in there, and I must admit, done to perfection.
629;A big meal, followed by smokes and whiskey, and then talk.
630;Annie, whose prose is amazingly lean, ticks off a whole page of things they talk about.
631;That was the line, just a single line, that opened the door enough to let me glimpse Ennis's heart.
632;To me it was the touchstone, the first baby step to love.
633;i found many other small steps after that, benefiting greatly from having read the book.
634;When the tent scene happened, it fit the story, at least in my mind.
635;i was surprised by my own reaction in the second viewing.
636;by the way, if I forgot to mention it, this is the finest movie I've ever seen.
637;I'm happy to say that the hype is well justified, as Brokeback Mountain is indeed a magnificient, flawlessly acted and directed, landmark film and the ultimate love story for our age.
638;The closeness of working together leads to a physical and romantic relationship, one which Jack doesn't want to lose after the job is ended.
639;But this being Wyoming in the 1960's, the genuine affection they felt for each other was repressed in some good ol' boy horsing around, and they went their separate ways, with Jack going back to his family in Texas.
640;nominated for 7 Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee, who absolutely redeemed himself for subjecting us to The Hulk), Best Actor (Heath Ledger, who showed an acting range of raw emotion not evident in any of his earlier work), Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams, who played Ledger's wife, and is today his real life live.
641;in girlfriend and mother of the baby they recently had together), Best Screenplay and Best Original Song (A Love That Will Never Grow Old).
642;Brokeback Mountain also won 8 other awards at various film festivals and critic competitions, and is sure to be a contender at Oscar time as well .
643;and it is all well deserved.
644;Think of it as a parable of our times, and how our society can often keep true love from prevailing.
645;It's a message that anyone can relate to, and everyone can't help but feel.
646;To paraphrase a review by Entertainment Weekly, Brokeback Mountain redefines our concept of a love story, and has the power to deeply affect the minds and hearts of anyone who sees it.

656;To paraphrase a review by Entertainment Weekly, Brokeback Mountain redefines our concept of a love story, and has the power to deeply affect the minds and hearts of anyone who sees it.
657;The inexplicable love the men feel for one another and the growing bitterness of their wives due to emotional neglect are clear to the audience, but not to the characters themselves.
658;In a particularly poignant scene, Ennis gives up an important job so that he'll be free to attend his daughter's wedding.
659;If Ennis's inability to deal with his emotions made him a distant father while his daughter was growing up, he has finally learned to value her love and acts accordingly.
660;a scene between Ennis and Jack's mother is also particularly touching, since the non.
661;a shared love for Jack .
662;themed comedies and dramas, they seldom hit multiplex theaters.
663;And as such, its critical acclaim and awards (with more to come) are well deserved.
664;BrokeBack Mountain is a great love story,not dirty.
665;I'm in love with this movie!
666;I sure know who he is now!
667;His eyes, lips and smile are phenomenal!
668;A pure pleasure to watch on.
669;It has to be viewed with and open mind and heart.
670;and it helps if you're already okay with the genre.
671;I hope in the future Heath and Jake would make more movies together.
672;they're good friends in real life.
673;i think their fan's would love it!
674;two people who love each other so much one is a part of the other.
675;It is a transformational story about love,rememberence and finally a totem of a shirt and jacket of the beloved which must be felt and smelled so that the one you love is still a part of you.
676;It is about loneliness of memories of wonderful good.
677;byes with a smile looking back waiting for the next meeting (a beautiful ending of the film).
678;the cinematogaphy is a masterpiece of bucolic landscapes anda beautiful scorce which adds a great deal of the emotional underlining of the two Ennis and Jack.
679;A masterpiece of direction by Ang Lee who through his art paints a portrait of a love that will not die, a love who is a part of you and cannot live without even if all you have are beautiful and sad memories and a shirt and jacket.
680;It will remain a great film one of the top 100 films ever made.
681;Heath Ledger pulled off his most amazing performance in this film.
682;Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
683;The subject of the movie has made some of my family members a bit uncomfortable when I've expressed my desire to see it but I've never seen such a beautiful story.
684;The emotion throughout the entire movie was so strong.
685;i was moved to tears several times (and that does NOT often happen to me during movies) The conflicts, the passion, the obvious love the two felt for each other.
686;so wonderfully portrayed by the actors made the movie all the more amazing.
687;Tugs at the heart and gives some of the best performances I've seen in a very long time.
688;All I want for Christmas is an entertaining good time.
689;Mr. Lee has directed a romantic masterpiece for the 21st century with the magnificent Brokeback Mountain, creating an instant classic.
690;The perfectly cast leads not only excel in their acting but capture the essence of the intensely passionate relationship that seemingly develops out of the blue between two handsome,masculine,rugged cowboys hired to manage a flock of sheep in a spectacularly majestic mountain setting.
691;this beautifully handled film allows anyone who watches it to identify with the emotions of erotic attraction,electric passion, tender romance,internal conflict,dramatic tragedy and life changing loss that are a big part of the human experience.
692;The elegant, leisurely pace and classic.
693;wrenching story as it unfolds.
694;a stunning achievement in all catagories that sets a new standard for cinematic love.
695;screen couple has become a modern legend.
696;It'll be a long time before anyone will be able to out do this work by a pair of intelligent, brave, extremely secure and gifted actors at the peak of their craft.
697;who really understood and felt the characters and the difficulty of this very complicated, highly emotional situation.
698;How fantastically refreshing to see homosexual desire portrayed by two very believably masculine young men with absolutely no trace of any theatrical, selfconcious, Will and Jack style.
699;And in doing so, showing the world that there are plenty of regular men discreetly enjoying the power of love/lust privately with each other right under everyone's noses!
700;Wishing Mr. Ledger's soul peace and love.
701;he left us with a piece of work that will hopefully inspire people to seek inner happiness by bravely facing one's inner, deeper truth.
702;An important film for women to see to help them better understand those men who were never able to fully commit to them.
703;Still, this one is as good as you've heard.
704;Yet, the story is compelling, and the female stars as the wives are very good, indeed.
705;Never in my many years have I seen a film as beautiful and touching as Brokeback Mountain.
706;brokeback will always be remembered as one of the most incredible pieces of art to ever come out of Hollywood!
707;as a film it is remarkable.
708;Ang Lee's direction is a masterly and will be studied.
709;Every image, every performance and edit is delicately and masterfully maintained throughout.
710;The performances are amazing and for some will be career defining.
711;Gyllenhaal is just as amazing.
712;Jake's performance is focused in his eyes and the sparkling flame within them.
713;Watching that flame diminish over time is heartbreaking.
714;Michelle Williams' Alma has deservedly received accolades and she is raw and real.
715;Just as noteworthy is Anne Hathaway and I must say she really surprised me.
716;In what could have been a mannered and arch character, she brings Lureen startlingly to life, most notably in her phone conversation with Ennis.
717;The photography and music are beautifully intertwined and will stir your emotions and haunt you for days.
718;In watching this movie I was just in awe of the cinematography as well as the exceptional acting by these two men.
719;Jake played a great part, comfortable, confident in his feelings.
720;it showed courage, love, humility, strength and perseverance.
721;Great Movie, Great Directing and especially Great Acting.
722;The cinematography was indeed well done.
723;wrenching motion picture offers nothing new or noteworthy.
724;ang Lee has crafted the one feature film that audiences will be discussing for many long years to come.
725;More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the talk Brokeback Mountain promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is.
726;Director Lee is the one man who should be labelled brave.
727;He, working directly from the Annie Proulx short story, has given us a revolutionary firsthand view of a deeply.
728;rooted relationship that was, for the time period it was set against, considered gravely taboo.
729;I had not been alive to experience the sixties, I grant you.
730;Director Lee, with this film, has shined an ever.
731;We feel the angst within Jack and Ennis, their sheer emotional passion and, ultimately, the genuine frustration of realizing they can never openly embrace their mutual attraction.
732;This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due.
733;But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore.
734;It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture.
735;Ang Lee, Ms. Proulx, take a bow and thank you both very much.
736;Somebody here recently penned a review claiming rather curiously that this breathtaking and profoundly heart.

738;More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the discussion Brokeback Mountain promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is.

743;This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due.
744;But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore.
745;Love, no matter how you may look at it, is what it is.
746;i am recommending this movie to everybody I know.
747;It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture.
748;Ang Lee, Ms. Proulx, take a bow and thank you both very much.
749;It is a romance movie that protrays humanity's best and worst.
750;This is the movie of a lifetime, and if you do not see it, you will be sorry.
751;This movie shows what true love is to human beings, and despite the fact that the women in this movie suffered, the female viewers of this movie are not offended.
752;I watched this movie with my wife, and I can assure you that we are both moved by the beauty of this movie.
753;this is simply the best and most heart.
754;wrenching love story i have ever seen.
755;it is the most touching movie u could ever watch and the most memorable one.
756;this movie is the best movie of all time and it should've won in all the categories it was nominated in at the academy awards.
757;the actors are amazing and they make the story feel so real, my favourite scene was the reunion after a few a years it was the most emotional scene.
758;i admire heath and jake for having the courage to do the movie, they were amazing.
759;and so was the directing, the script and everything.
760;the music was so amazing, it added to the sadness of the movie.
761;Brokeback Mountain is the most beautiful and the most unforgetable movie of the year.
762;Probably the best of all time.
763;I feel fortunate to have seen it in my lifetime.
764;At the heart of Brokeback Mountain is a love between two people that can never be fully realized because of societal pressures.
765;Their sexual encounters and make out sessions are full of aggressive desire but very little actual love and tenderness.
766;the film is photographed beautifully and acted superbly, but without the central love the film revolves around I was left feeling disinterested.
767;Perhaps someday we will see a film that represents gay realtionships a realistic light, but Brokeback Mountain is certainly not the one.
768;Excellent portrayal of what is Real life.
769;Well performed by all major actors, sympathetic to theme.
770;Never has a movie so moved me as Brokeback Mountain.
771;You actually feel for the characters they have created and feel the love they have for each other.
772;It has moved people by the thousands and improved lives.
773;This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types.
774;Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible.
775;ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director.
776;The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them.
777;The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond.
778;up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar.
779;Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.
780;I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis.
781;brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures.
782;The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top.
783;notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid.
784;The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, Brokeback Mountain is a film I recommend watching.
785;It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today.
786;aside from the absolutely breathtaking cinematography and perfectly customized soundtrack, this film encompasses the turmoil and heartbreak of an impossible love story.
787;They managed to be both passionately sexy and boyishly uncertain in their characters.
788;I imagine they have done the author of this story proud.
789;sexual shepherds leave the sheep to their dogs and cayotes and keep warm (very warm)when they discoverlove in a tent.
790;Heath Ledger (Ennis)maintains an expressionless face, but Jake G's (Jack Twist) beautiful eyes speak volumes.
791;One of the best scenes is the Christmas dinner at Jack Twist's home, where his abominable father in law LB Newsome tries to assume control by carving the turkey.
792;Jack reveals true backbone, wrests control of the carving knife and the television switch, but later pays with his life.
793;I didn't watch this, but my granddaughter says this is one of her favorite movies of all.
794;She's seventeen and quite the movie buff.
795;This movie really touched me.
796;I think the acting was superb, and the story line was very moving.
797;At first, I was reticent to watch it because of the two men thing, but I got beyond that and saw it simply as a love story between two people who, due to societal circumstances, could not share their lives together.
798;The best part, I think, was seeing how they gradually fell in love and then to see the passion of that love.
799;In fact, it is so good that critics let some church's homophobic propaganda get the best of them.
800;This movie has it all: heart.
801;felt storyline, beautiful cinematography, story dynamic, and turn of events.
802;You can love this movie, or hate it, but in the end, you have to admit that this is the best movie made in the last decade, particularly considering that this movie did not throw in hundreds of millions of dollars.
803;Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing.
804;During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers.
805;The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship .
806;long fishing trips they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public.
807;The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present.
808;This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar.
809;Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one.
810;It is a well done film no matter the subject, it is the story of two people in love who ache for each other and yet are forced to be apart.
811;Enis is quiet to the point of seeming almost mute and Jack is the more lively of the two.
812;way so nobody will see.
813;Over the next several years they both marry and become fathers.
814;The scene of their reunion 4 years later has so much emotion, longing and passion that it will take your breath away.
815;They way they look at each other and that first kiss is one of the most powerful I've seen onscreen and I have to comend both actors.
816;This movie however is not just about Jack and Enis, but also shows the effect on their wives, Michelle Williams of Dawsons creek does an amazing job of playing the wife of Enis who discovers his secret but stays quiet because she sees no other option and Anne Hathaway saying Good.
817;this is a film that will keep you invloved until the last credit on the screen goes blank and kudos to Ang Lee for putting such a memorable film onscreen.
818;I'll be honest from the get.
819;My husband is a wonderful man, he even went to see BBM with me in the theatre and liked it.
820;it's my life, right up there on the big screen.
821;i thank Ang Lee, Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, and all the others associated with this movie who took the biggest chance you can possibly take in Hollywood and came out shining.
822;This movie really grabs you.
823;The actors are excellent, and the story very decent, despite what people may think before they see it.
824;This is a movie that every person that is sensitive about love stories must see!
825;It's very sweet, sensual and meaningful.
826;We have to enjoy this film.
827;This is an excellent film that I think everyone should go and see whether you're straight or not.
828;This compelling story succeeds in every possible way.
829;Both lead actors give fantastic and mesmerizing performances that really grabs your heart and soul.
830;A great script and a great director is also on the mantle and the supporting cast is just as good and shine on their own.
831;People with short attention spand will not benefit from the rewards that this film brings which among other things it is a great piece of filmmaking.
832;A beautiful film all around which boosts a beautiful and natural scenery that you will find to your enjoyment.
833;It is nominated for seven Golden Globes including Best Picture and I am almost positive that it will receive a handful of Oscar nods as well.
834;Brokeback Mountain is a gem of a movie one that really makes you think and analyze things and you will find this film is a story that is very much a part of the society that we live in because this sort of thing happens more often that we tend to think.
835;what a break through movietwo actors who were very very believableI watch this one over and overOne of my all time favorite movies and the director is amazing theCanadian mountains breathtaking too.
836;The story is as powerful as the cinematography.
837;If one cannot get past the issue of two men falling in love they should at least be moved by the fact that love transcends everything including time and distance and circumstances.
838;i have been listening to the soundtrack and the score is equally as moving and haunting simultaneously.
839;A very moving and touching story.
840;If a person has any humanity at all, he or she will be touched to the heart.
841;I have loved this movie since it first came out.
842;He was telling the truth.
843;The feeling the two men have for each other provides motivation.
844;what I found fascinating was watching the unfolding of the story after the 'interlude' at Brokeback Mountain.
845;The contrast of their lives after Brokeback and the the impact of their relationship on other characters makes for a fascinating and well.
846;told story that rises above the prurient.
847;the acting was great, but I believe the writing and directing in this movie is even better.
848;There are certain things that hit the viewer immediately the first time you see this film .
849;the beauty of the landscape for one thing.
850;There was something much deeper than sexuality at play .
851;This is most definitely a show, don't tell film.
852;if they had just completed their sheepherding jobs and moved on.
853;There are scenes (before the postcard arrives) that leave you feeling that he is, in fact, in love with his wife and children.
854;His unraveling as the years go by is all about Jack and it's almost as if his only reason to live are for his stolen moments with Jack on Brokeback Mountain.
855;jack, on the other hand, displays a clearer sense of self from the beginning.
856;He is the more openly sensitive of the two, more skillful at getting needs met and taking initiative.
857;More expressive in every way.
858;But, as with Ennis, his life is fueled by their meetings on Brokeback Mountain, with a few detours along the way.
859;But this is all just part of what makes this movie so brilliant.
860;You find yourself experiencing the film emotionally, not just watching it and that's very surprising (and somewhat disorienting) in a way.
861;It's just a story about two men in a certain time, place and situation and should be viewed that way.
862;ang Lee is an amazing director.
863;The casting was spot on .
864;Heath Ledger is an exceptional actor, no question (he gave a powerful performance in the film, The Order) but it is Jake Gyllenhaal who, for me, carried this film in a way that stirred up my insides (I was on his emotional I wish I knew how to quit you rollercoaster).
865;i recommend this film, though I know it might not be for everyone (I hear that it's been banned in Utah, actually).
866;And if you have that not sure feeling at first, I can guarantee that it will eventually settle.
867;*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I absolutely loved this movie.
868;It touched my heart and soul in a profound way.
869;Here is a partial explanation, from my point of view.
870;The brilliant conveyance of such emotion is a tribute to the director and lead actors.
871;My sense is that deeply connecting with the audience is what most serious actors and directors continually strive for in their work.
872;To attain it to this extent is remarkable and laudable and what makes this movie great.
873;i left the theater somewhat morose, but took away an uplifting life lesson as well, which was the central message of the movie, for me.
874;I am surprised at my reaction to this movie .
875;Ang Lee, you have created a masterpiece of story telling, of love, loss, tragedy, that has moved me like no other movie I have ever seen .
876;He can, away from the rest of the world, be happy.
877;Jack, who it seems knows who he is and is accepting of that part of himself, is able to draw Ennis out of himself.
878;One shot thing after all and Ennis parts with Jack believing that it's over, and that he'll go on the with the rest of his life as planned.
879;screen intensity and their impact on the story itself .
880;when Jack and Ennis see each other for the first time in 4 years, when they first embrace, and then let their repressed emotions and lust come bubbling to the surface, and when for the first time, Ennis is in a place where they can be easily discovered .
881;I mean, they are right outside his front door, in the back of a laundry mat .
882;I thought that was an incredibly powerful scene with the three actors.
883;card, with tears stinging his eyes, saying Jack, I swear .
884;and the door closes (very symbolic) and the music (another important component to the story telling) takes us to black .
885;i've seen many good movies that have moved me to tears and made me stop and think.
886;but Heath and Jack should have won co. best actor awards.
887;And Ang Lee is a brilliant director to have been able elicit that kind of emotion and intesity and to put a movie on screen that has so deeply and profoundly touched so many people .
888;This movie was the ultimate love story as what a man can give to another man by a glance, a touch, and a never ending love.
889;everyone was so upset that this movie did not win for Best Picture, but for us who have lived this life this story has won our hearts.
890;i loved everything about this film.
891;It was a great story, the actors are amazing as always.
892;There are many definitions of love.
893;It's surprising and lawless and forbidden and passionate and so wrong, but so right.
894;And with the release of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, director Ang Lee brings to the screen a film that, at its core, is about this kind of love.
895;Ennis is quiet, resilient, a man of few words
896;Their love affair spans twenty years, through marriages and divorces and children.
897;BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is their love story, the tale of a love doomed to fail.
898;but a love so beautiful and powerful it makes all the heartbreak worth it.
899;heath Ledger is brilliant as the reserved, stoic Ennis Del Mar.
900;His performance is sensual and emotional and passionate
901;Jake Gyllenhaal is also phenomenal as innocent, eager Jack Twist.
902;Both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway give commendable performances as the wives of the two men.
903;The movie is brilliantly acted.
904;but if it's brilliantly acted, it's even more brilliantly directed.
905;Director Ang Lee's film is atmospheric and poignant.
906;The film builds up to one explosive moment, the crescendo of rapture, and then slowly changes into something even more incredible as love replaces the initial release of passion.
907;It's a love story, plain and simple.
908;The scenery is noble and gritty and breathtaking
909;BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a cinematic masterpiece, a love story that will singlehandedly redefine its genre, and will change how films are made forever after.
910;Please let me begin by saying that I honestly feel we are entitled to love whomever we choose to love .
911;with the exception of Alma's (Michelle Williams) love for Ennis and of course, her little girls.
912;jack is obviously attracted to men, and Ennis is caught up in a moment of weakness.
913;i believe we are fascinated by this story because it is so unique
914;And sexual encounter is all that it is.
915;this movie shows how innocent love can start out to be, and how twisted the world can make it in the end.
916;The most important part about this movie is how the characters are forced into marriage, but had to manage to their love.
917;There is no other word to describe this movie, as it demonstrate true beauty, and humanity.
918;the mountains are very pretty.
919;the woman are as well.
920;anne hathaway does a great job in the back seat of a car.
921;the director did a good spin job here!
922;finally everyone has moved on to doing something better, because with all the zombies running around you never know what might happen on the mountain.
923;Ang Lee's film, Brokeback Mountain, is one of those rare events that impacts not only the entertainment industry and its supporters, but also impacts our society by revealing truths of the human heart that may run counter to society's prescriptions and rules.
924;it is a love story beween two men that emerges out of a totally unlikely place, the cowboy world of windswept Wyoming in 1963.
925;To a certain extent, high above the world of civilization, in a more natural state, these two young men enter an Eden.
926;It is a Garden of Eden first in its natural beauty and then second in the love that is allowed to flourish there.
927;to recapture the young love they felt for each other, and to meet their sexual needs.
928;Part of the dynamic between Anne and Jack is that she is a young woman who has been given everything, yet she marries a man with a hidden ability to love inside that she will never be able to touch, she will only always remain aware that it is there and it is not meant for her.
929;Yet Alma opens the front door and observes this embrace and knows that this is a passion she has never experienced with Ennis.
930;jack Twist, played superbly by Jake Gyllenhaal, emerges as the character that is most emotionally available.
931;He makes himself available to Ennis and is the most open to these two men divorcing their wives and becoming life partners.
932;He is aware of his needs and has sex with other men beside Ennis.
933;ennis del Mar, played perfectly by Heath Ledger, is an emotionally more complex and stunted character.
934;Yet it is the character growth of Ennis that in some ways is the real trajectory of the story.
935;HOwever, he realizes he will never be happy with this young woman and she will never be fulfilled with him.
936;He ends the budding romance in a way that tells us he has gained in wisdom and self knowledge.
937;In the end we see Ennis as a wounded and broken fellow, destined to mourn the love he could have nourished and experienced, and yet we see him begin to celebrate the budding love of his eldest daughter.
938;Sometimes we do our best to understand ourselves and the world and it still comes out a tragedy.
939;Knowing this, we must be grateful for those times of communion of the heart, which come to us like grace, like an unsought gift, but which transforms us forever.
940;When I saw Crash early last year, I felt throughout 2005 that it was one of the best films of that year.
941;The performances, the haunting music, and breathtaking cinematography are the most genius I've ever seen on film.
942;Every movie I've seen since Brokeback Mountain has paled in comparison.
943;To truly understand and appreciate this work of art in cinematic history, you need a certain level of intelligence and sensitivity.
944;And if you watch with an open heart, it will do the same for you.
945;I Loved this movie, let me say that first and foremost.
946;Quite possibly the best movie I have seen in a while.
947;deserving of it's Oscar nomination.
948;indeed, it was an excellent film about life, about love.
949;And if you have read any of my other reviews (or know me), you know that I very much enjoy films and stories that tug at our heartstrings and emotions.
950;the film takes us on a journey between 2 individuals (played well by Jake and Heath), and transports the viewer over 20 years, beginning in 1963.
951;After spending the summer of 1963 as ranch hands, both return to their normal lives, 1 in Wyoming, the other in Texas.
952;I am sure others watching the film like me can only hope we'll find someone in our life who will love us with so much courage and emotion.
953;Proof our society has yet to understand the dynamics of love, set forth in this film.
954;But Brokeback Mountain was also a tremendous film.
955;As a Idaho ranch boy I have long been involved with the western way of life.
956;It is nice to see a movie that does not make all gay men look like the sterotypical.
957;it is nice to see that the main stream public can finally realize yes there are gay men who like to be around horses and yes we do rodeo and yes we live our lives in a manor that it is not the normal gay life.
958;In addition to its keenly observed portrait of two men in love, who live in perpetual fear of discovery and reprisal, the multi.
959;it is an overwhelming passion and intense love that propels Ennis and Jack, the protagonists of the film, to defy societal convention and see each other in secret.
960;This thing grabs hold of us.
961;Although Jack remains closeted, he has a keener sense of himself, and has successfully erected a wall between himself and the negative opinions of others.
962;He is willing to take risks in order to be happy, but his overpowering love for Ennis forces him to conceal his true self and seals, ultimately, his fate.
963;I ultimately decided, however, to view this film as a depiction of, and a comment on, a particular time and place in history, and to admire its fierce courage in depicting passion between two men with insight and sensitivity.
964;It is a love that lingers in one's memory, and stabs at one's heart.
965;A damn good film from an even better book.
966;Covers the territory well, if a bit too dramatic in a few places.
967;In time I will watch it again.
968;Give love a chance when we find it.
969;This was an awesome movie, that shows the struggle of gay people.
970;I would recommend it to anyone, and everyone who is willing to open there mind and see it for what it is, a love story.
971;Both the book and the movie are so well written.
972;You are drawn to the characters, their lives and loves, and all is given with a humanity view.
973;Brokeback is all about falling deeply in love and what you will do and feel for another person.
974;about a gay romance and is getting some pretty high reviews.
975;this is outrageous to put in a film that gay people are supporting.
976;I was really impressed with both the actors and the story setting.
977;This movie shows the power of passion like anyone did before.
978;touching, great actors, beautiful landscapes part of the poetic dialogues, a must see !
979;I thought this film was incredibly well made on nearly every technical aspect, beautiful and haunting and authentic.
980;The acting was also very, very good.
981;The period was represented amazingly well and the score and direction were also both simply great and restrained.
982;hype, I'd say it's very much a worth.
983;This drama is first class with the acting on both men worthy of oscars.
984;Don't worry, you do not see a bunch of skin and I even recommend teenagers to view film.
985;Just do the math, and you will know that the small audience you speak of is actually the majority of the world.
986;There is a reason movies made it to best seller status.
987;Even when the film industry is brave enough to make a masterpiece as moving as Brokeback Mountain, showing that men can express truly love to each other, there are still people backwards enough to reject that.
988;The story touched my heart.
989;The acting of two actors are excellent.
990;Brokeback was surely THE best picture of 2006 robbed of the Best Picture Oscar by small minded self.
991;The cinematography, score, direction and acting all are 1st rate in this romantic epic for the ages!
992;If anyone knows when its going to be released please let me know.
993;There are a few things that contribute to the popularity of this movie.
994;first and most importantly, it is the courage it took to make this movie.
995;Even when director Ang Lee picked up this script, and turn it into a masterpiece, there are still Christian groups protesting it, imagine what happened when they were producing it!
996;(Good thing the filming took place in Canada)Second, it is the artistic sense required to make this movie.
997;The kind of care and effort required to create the emotions of this movie is extreme.
998;This movie pulled two mainstream actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, and allows them to masterfully shine on the movie screen with nothing but their acting skills.
999;Everyone should see this movie.
1000;Love has very good times and it has the worst, so seldom a balance of the two.
1001;This film about forbidden love during a time when coming out of the closet could get you killed is truly heartbreaking.
1002;The screenplay stayed true to the short story and the actors took on their roles with maturity and dedication.
1003;Excellent writing and direction as well as beautiful scenery.
1004;Lastly, and this a purely a technical note, both lead actors' dialects are imperfect.
1005;themed film, see The Wedding Banquet.
1006;What I really found interesting about this film is that as the story unfolds you start to see Jack and Ennis not so much as gay/bisexual men, but rather as people in love.
1007;brokeback mountain is for everyone and is the best movie of any decade, and this movie isn't just about 2 gay cowboys, this is the new american true love story, that goes way beyond any other love story, it has impacted countless lives, broke down barriers and has and will continue to break barriers in minds of those whom doubt love between 2 people, this is the #1 movie of all time.
1008;lauded, and criticized and re.
1009;No matter: director Ang Lee's Oscar.
1010;So raw and honest do they carry the love (and its consequences) between their characters that both Ledger and Gyllenhaal may well have cemented themselves as A. caliber leading men in their industry.
1011;Following the social script of the day, both men marry and have children but continue occasionally to hook up privately through the years.
1012;When they do, the emotional power of their passion and love .
1013;martial affair, much less an unconventional one, than Ledger's screen wife (Michelle Williams, also in an Oscar.
1014;Together, director Ang, Ledger and Gyllenhaal give us a disarming but honest and usually painful treatment of love that, for whatever reason, is forbidden and .
1015;To the contrary, the finale is emotionally wrenching.
1016;age, and has litle more than memories of a love not fully embraced.
1017;No gay movie, this one: it is, in the final analysis, a simple love story, and its honesty, integrity and brillant acting command respect.
1018;Hence, the film's subtle warning: treat love with care
1019;He is simply that good and awesome, and he manages to stir the basic of the deepest of human emotion.
1020;Brokeback Mountain the film is a perfectly faithful and reasonable adapatation of Brokeback Mountain the short story by Annie Proulx.
1021;I saw the film before I read the story, and was deeply moved and affected by it.
1022;Unemployed with no prospects, contemplating having to move in with his married daughter until he can find another job, Ennis is nonetheless happy because he has awakened from a dream about Jack.
1023;As the events related in the film unfold in flashback, we come to understand that Ennis does not fully realize at first that what he feels for Jack is love
1024;In the short term, Brokeback Mountain will be a celebrated film that conserve.
1025;The movie is great but why do they have to advertise it on the cover?
1026;I really think Brokeback Mountain is one of my favorite movies now.
1027;Both Heath and Jake are both wonderful in it.
1028;This movie has had the most profound effect on me, like no other movie has.
1029;This is a universal story of two people who are trapped between the expectations of the world at large and dealing with the conflict of their larger.
1030;The ending ripped my heart out, and at the same time, renewed my sense of love.
1031;It was affirming, mesmerizing, and powerful.
1032;A true classic, that will withstand time.
1033;Bought because a friend told me it was good.
1034;i found it visually and emotionally beautiful, all the accolades bestowed upon it richly deserved, and probably more.
1035;it was well, all i can say is when a medium like film can move a person to tears and to stir up inner emotions so, that is a special thing.
1036;like others, i feel protective of the movie, of these two boys, who could be to any one of us a son, brother, father, friend.
1037;brokeback mountain is like a beautiful piece of music that becomes part of your soul.
1038;i have seen it four times in two days, and my eyes swim with tears every time, even thinking of it. . . driving to work today a song came on, and the movie fresh in my mind, i wept silently in the privacy of my car.
1039;for jack and ennis, for loves that all of us have had at one time or another in life that we lost.
1040;the raw emotion and hunger for one another.
1041;it's shocking in its intensity, but anyone who has ever had a love of a lifetime absolutely gets that moment for them, when time stands still and the only people in the world that exist are the two of them.
1042;as ennis gently cradles him from behind, rocking slowly with him, the look of peace and serenity on jack's face and the longing loving look as ennis rides away, blows me away.
1043;you feel the same sadness and loss for what could have been, so beautifully effectively done.
1044;after months of being curious amidst all the buzz, seeing is believing.
1045;I had tears in my eyes while reading it and absolutely agree with every word he/she wrote.
1046;It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I will treasure it as long as I live.
1047;Innis says with, great tenderness.
1048;This if one of the defining moments of the film for me.
1049;And deep down inside, Ennis has feelings for Jack, but he rejects the idea of having a life together with Jack.
1050;And I didn't think of this until today, but it's ironic at the end of the movie how Ennis's daughter announces she is going to get married, and she's all happy about it.
1051;On the contrary, I felt that the make up artists did a good job at making them look older, particularly with Jack having the moustache and a little bit of grey hair.
1052;And I thought it was touching when Ennis cried after their summer of sheep herding came to an end.
1053;And it was even more touching as Ennis hugged Jack's coat towards the end of the movie.
1054;And I also hope that this helps to change society's view on homosexuality.
1055;Truly an exceptional achievement in every way.
1056;a true heartbreaking performance by Michelle Williams.2.
1057;THe next scene shows Jack in sharp contrast to the first one.
1058;just a great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.
1059;there are so many dimensions to this film and so many fine scenesand all the performances are outstanding!
1060;I believe Gyllenhaal deserved to win the Oscar although I certainly did not consider him to be a supporting actor in this movie
1061;This film is one I will never tire of seeing over and over again!
1062;adding, by way of explanation, that as a very susceptible person, easily influenced .
1063;Ledger, an Australian actor, seamlessly fits into the role of Ennis and gives one of the year's best performances.
1064;Early on, he seems to begin each sentence with the anxiety of a man stepping onto a high ledge, and when he does speak he mumbles through a mouth distorted by a chaw of tobacco.
1065;gyllenhaal, as the more expressive of the pair, has the flashier part but is effective as well
1066;Yes, this is one of the year's best, and it mines genuine sadness from situations that might've easily turned unintentionally funny .
1067;let's face it, there's comic potential in the idea of gay cowboys, and Leno and Letterman have probably hit it all.
1068;In this film each character has found a happy respite from their spouce and that's enough.
1069;Their tryst stands the test of time but when you look deeper this is a character study at its best.
1070;what's most compelling about this story is that even though it's a time capsule, it's also timeless.
1071;There are always people who find reasons to throw happiness away, and wind up inviting heart break.
1072;And even though this film is heart breaking, I recommend it for the cinematography, fantastic cast, and the always surprising unhappy ending that Hollywood is rarely brave enough to provide.
1073;The performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are equally well done.
1074;beautifully understated with an understanding of their characters and the love they share.
1075;Surely they deserved Oscars for their incredible work.
1076;Their long absences heighten the sex, but their love is based on mutual attraction and compatibility: mutual ways of life, mutual interests, comfort in each other's company,.
1077;the picture is directed and filmed beautifully.
1078;The gorgeous Wyoming (Canadian) mountain scenery matches the love Jack and Ennis express there, just as Ennis's squalid apartment and trailer match the sad, alternative family life he creates in the one and the barren life his own self denial and timidity create in the other.
1079;A magnificent movie at every level, a lasting testament to all the artists involved, from Annie Proulx, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry, and Ang Lee to everyone else, including Rufus Wainwright, the openly gay singer on the soundtrack.
1080;Brokeback Mountain deserves all the awards it has won and all the Academy Award nominations it received and the three it won.
1081;This movie got a large amount of controversy, all of it going to its theme: homosexuality.
1082;Brokeback in many ways shows that it's still a problem with people and while it may have some storytelling issues I have a problem with, it's still a solid story, it's only missing something that makes it an absolute masterpiece.
1083;A meeting between the 2 men rekindles their relationship and now have a decision to make: to continue in short and increasing gaps of time or call it off forever, not experiencing each other's love anymore.
1084;The film has been called groundbreaking but really it's just a love story, only with 2 men.
1085;Storytelling wise these could be called groundbreakers too and they've been done before as well.
1086;Jake Gyllenhaal is good as well but the biggest attention went to Heath Ledger.
1087;it's odd how the filmmakers want us to root for the love of 2 gay men despite the fact both are committing adultery, one of which is actually with 2 others, including his wife.
1088;It's slightly manipulative as well since the cinematography during their passionate love trips are beautifully shot with mountain ranges while their normal homes have drabby looking houses, crying kids and depressed looking wives.
1089;It's no wonder we want to root for the men don't we?I will give the film props though: it is a love story and it's handled nicely if one sided and the actors are more than willing to show it.
1090;expect a double dip, this one is guaranteed.
1091;Obviously wanting to capitalize on the Oscar attention, the film comes with a very barebones disc, coming up with no more than 4 featurettes.
1092;Coincidentally, Crash which got the upset Best Picture win over this film is released on the same day with a bigger release.
1093;It's a solid story and while it is a good film, I can see why it lost, although personally, Crash is no better.
1094;Everyone knows that real cowboys only existed in the brief two.
1095;This movie was so real to me.
1096;I viewed it looking for passion in character and culture in the cowboy lifestyle.
1097;to the myriad of reviewers who have applauded the film, I respect your admiration.
1098;It is a beautifully shot film and captures scenery of the west magically.
1099;She deserves the nomination in both Golden Globe and the Academy Award.
1100;In contrast, I wonder why it won the Golden Globe and was nominated in the Oscar.
1101;Anyway, there are still many other gay films better than Brokeback Mountain like Just a question of love, You I love, Farewell my concubine, and the Wedding Banquet.
1102;Everyone is reviewing the movie .
1103;Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is breathtaking and spectacular, while at the same time being almost Zen.
1104;like in its unhurried beauty and tranquility.
1105;Brokeback Mountain is destined to be among Dances With Wolves, The English Patient, Out Of Africa, At Play In The Fields Of The Lord and other sweeping, epic visual classics.
1106;This film deserves to be watched on as BIG a screen as possible for its sheer, scenic beauty alone.
1107;takes would have been a lot of fun to see as well!
1108;A few music videos (the score won an Oscar), could have been included.
1109;Since we're in Oscar territory, having seen both Capote and Brokeback Mountain, while Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance was undeniably brilliant, (IMHO), Heath Ledger deserved to win Best Actor for his remarkable, INCREDIBLY understated and restrained portayal of Ennis Del Mar (still, all the while ticking underneath like an emotional time.
1110;Scenes like that are repeatedly and each time beautifully conveyed not only by them, but by ALL of the outstanding actors.
1111;Michelle Williams as Alma (Ennis' wife), deserves special mention .
1112;a superb quiet storm throughout, the look on her face when Ennis is about to go fishing with Jack the first time is worth a thousand words.
1113;and then had to make up the rest, as they needed twice as much for the movie (and the flawless job they did winning them a well.
1114;What was most touching though, was what they said upon its release: We are stewards of the story.
1115;It's like raising a child, you hope the child is accepted and successful, and you send it out into the world and it ceases to be yours.
1116;Jake Gyllenhaal added, I'm always looking for films that go after an emotional journey.
1117;therein lies the real beauty of Brokeback Mountain .
1118;and a testament to the labor of love from everyone who brought it from thirty pages to the screen.
1119;worthy performance and one that will always remain a legacy of his, Brokeback Mountain is destined and deserves to become an American classic and legacy that thankfully, the world finally seems ready for.
1120;Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death.
1121;whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way.
1122;But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen.
1123;I will make a point of seeing it again before it leaves the theaters.
1124;This movie is art at its finest, and in the 2D 21st Century we live it, this piece of art probably defines humanity at its best.
1125;the nature scenes were very well filmed.
1126;This is an amazing story of love.
1127;It definitely does the book justice.
1128;Ang Lee's slightly overhyped Brokeback Mountain was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.
1129;This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.
1130;No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.
1131;ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre.
1132;It can be a very emotional film and is a very emotional film.
1133;I was 2 years younger than Ennis and Jack so it hits home.
1134;That too was a wonderful piece of work and I don't think there could be anything musically adds to enhance the film.
1135;Thank you to all who worked so hard to make this wonderful film.
1136;To me it's up there with Gone With the Wind and Titanic as some of our greatest movies made.
1137;I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives.
1138;lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.
1139;It is a great love story that happened in the wrong place at the wrong time (cowboy country in the 60s).
1140;Everything about this movie is great.
1141;An amazing film of an amazingly written story.
1142;The adaptation of the story to a screenplay was genius, and the film was as beautiful as it was depressing.
1143;This director clearly knows nothing about what attracts one person to another.
1144;I can tell you that the ending definitely made me cry.
1145;This is a movie that haunts you long after it is done.
1146;It resonates far stronger than most films and speaks to universal truths and emotions not just that of a few people.
1147;it is funny that as the film progresses, the normal lives the characters pretend to lead begin to ring more and more hollow until they seem to be the oddity.
1148;remarkable performances and wonderful restraint by everyone involved makes this a film that will last far longer than some.
1149;There is real humanness to everyone in the story both men and women.
1150;Nothing is crystal clear and the boundaries keep moving.
1151;worthy of a best picture award and more likely, in my mind, to be the film that stands the test of time.
1152;They hate but continue to tell themselves and others that they are full of Christ's love!
1153;I embrace my gay friends and know that they are more sincere and loving than any Christian I have ever met.
1154;Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.
1155;This performance may be his finest yet.
1156;It is a very internalized one.
1157;He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time.
1158;he just keeps it bottled up inside.
1159;there is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship.
1160;It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives.
1161;Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look.
1162;On Being a Cowboy takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera.
1163;Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee is a love fest for the director.
1164;The cast praise his direction and talk about how much they admire him.
1165;This film was an exceptional experience.
1166;It gave us a view into a deeply emotionaly love that was difficult for it participants to express or at points to even recognize and yet it held them together for nearly 2o years.
1167;Ang Lee showed us how love could be a Force of Nature almost having a life of it's own.
1168;When I heard Ang Lee was directing however I was compelled to see it.
1169;the movie is from start to finish a through and through work of art.
1170;it's touching without being heart.
1171;stringy, presenting believable, well developed human characters in realistic situations.
1172;in terms of acting I was most surprised.
1173;Their performances were good enough to make me, probably their biggest detractor, praise them for Oscar worthy jobs.
1174;without gushing too much more, the movie is (like all Ang Lee movies) a technical masterpiece, with beautiful stark cinemaphotography, fluid editing and exceptional use of sound.
1175;he had more small town friendliness and earnestness than bruce springsteen could muster.
1176;The first true gay love story I saw was a wonderful movie called Big Eden.
1177;It is a beautifully filmed and well acted soap opera.
1178;If you would rather see a movie about true romantic love and commitment, check out Big Eden.
1179;Director show us a kind of noble and true love in human.
1180;The end is great which last in my memorary long time.
1181;I liked exactly two things about this, the single most over.
1182;The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself.
1183;Namely: Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!
1184;I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground.
1185;Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed.
1186;Am I alone in seeing that as.
1187;And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being.
1188;This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love.
1189;superb acting from all four principles, restrained yet purposeful direction, a fantastic story.you must admire the result.
1190;This is a beautiful movie, a gay movie, a human movie, an example of high achievement in the art of film.
1191;And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being.
1192;This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love.
1193;superb acting from all four principles, restrained yet purposeful direction, a fantastic story.you must admire the result.
1194;This is a beautiful movie, a gay movie, a human movie, an example of high achievement in the art of film.
1195;Great scenes of the countryside I cannot deny.
1196;Ledger and Gylenhall are great actors who could have picked something better to play with.
1197;They make one final push with the pro alternative lifestyle approach and still botch it up.
1198;This film stands tall as one of the best love stories ever written, filmed and acted in a long time.
1199;The acting on all fronts is spot on and thats important in a film of this magnitude.
1200;No, this may not mean you see yourself as a homosexual man living a lie, but you can see the true intentions of the heart, you can see your life through eyes yet unseen.
1201;I guess the best way to put it is this.
1202;As has been said by many a critic, this film is a universal love story.
1203;Yes I agree that it is mainly about the gay community and their stiving towards acceptance, but it really is so much more than that.
1204;Jack and Ennis found what one can rarely find these days, a love that transends time and rules and boundrys and even death.
1205;The brilliance here is in the depth of each charactor.
1206;To me, the star of this film is Jake Gyllenhall who gave a powerhouse performance and really proved to be the emotional core of the film.
1207;This is a beautiful story of two men who needed to be loved and needed to be accepted.
1208;They found love and they found acceptance but it came with a price.
1209;but as the film, to me at least, shows so well is that that price is worth it's weight in gold if it means being happy.
1210;These men never got to enjoy that bennifit because they never took hold of what they had.
1211;no, he loved Jack but he was afraid of what man would do to him, what society would do to him, and I feel that he loved his wife, he loved her and didn't want to hurt her.
1212;He knew being with her was the politically correct thing to do even though the lie of a life he was leading was killing them both.
1213;be happy because a life lived alone inside is the worst life to live.
1214;She turned out a steller performance that I feel was overlooked because of all the attention Miss Williams is receiving.
1215;It'll break your heart, a tragic love story.
1216;Anyway, glorious scenery, and Heath Ledger is just amazing as Ennis, there were times when I thought he was going to literally break on camera he was in so much pain.
1217;This is an absolutely amazing movie.
1218;It breaks all of the boundaries of movie, and protrayed true love as it is.
1219;this movie has to be the best movie that I have seen in a very long time.
1220;Finally a movie that tells the story Of what real love can be.
1221;But as a film itself, it's a wonderfully simple, plaintive accomplishment.
1222;a nice film, based on a great short story.
1223;But when ever gay actors will be able to do as much, that'd be nice.
1224;can you imagine white actors playing African.
1225;i liked watching it in Spanish, too.
1226;True love between two modern cowboys over a period of 20 years.
1227;Deserves all the praise it created.
1228;Brokeback Mountain has got to be one of the best movies this year.
1229;I've always loved Michelle Williams (I was a big Dawson's fan), and even though she really wasn't in the film that much, she did an amazing job when she was.
1230;The casting of Heath and Jake was just perfect.
1231;I really recommend you all see it.
1232;I'm glad to have lived long enough to see a movie of such pure greatness!
1233;Mark my words, this film will go down as one of the top films of the 21st century!Imagine!
1234;A love story between two men that will probably sweep the Academy Awards in one of the most homophobic countries in the Western World!
1235;But Brokeback Mountain transcends sexual orientation and all other classifications we like to lump people into!
1236;It's about ultimate erotic love, mutually shared, between two adults.
1237;Something many of us will never truly experience in our entire lives.
1238;This brilliant story is a wake.
1239;up call to all of us, Gay, Bi.
1240;now: it's amazing that Ang has been able to package up a sliver of Flyover America and make it palatable even.
1241;chic and utterly sensitive sensibilities: hey, who doesn't like a movie about gay cowboys!
1242;Mother Nature is a real b*tch when it comes down to it: She turns her back on our boys, and the rest just plays out like a gunfight at the Not.
1243;by contrast, Heath Ledger is the Nancy, wearing that anxious but will you respect me in the morning look.
1244;Our fathers got John Wayne battling Apaches and Commanches: our generation gets Heath and Jake bumping uglies on the Lone Prairie.
1245;Thank you so much fo making this Movie, The Most Amazing Movie I Have Ever Saw If every movie I ever saw was this good I would love my life a lot more.
1246;anything that humanity knows is important, and must be changed for the better will be made into a movie.
1247;Hollywood give us directors, and writers who act through their soul, and deliver this soul to the audience.
1248;This movie is certainly a relieve from all the lack.
1249;content movies we always see (movies like The Transporter or Wedding Crasher).
1250;It is based purely on the soul, and skills of the producers, making this movie a route to humanity's best.
1251;Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare movies that addresses a controversial subject, managing to hit a nerve with mainstream America, opening discussion and hopefully opening minds.
1252;And who would have thought that the romantic love story of the year would involve a couple of gay cowboys from the director of Sense and Sensibility and The Hulk?The story centers around two men, Ennis Del Mar, played skillfully by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal.
1253;During that summer of long days and cool nights, the two men forge a friendship.
1254;once their summer jobs are over, the two men move on with their lives, starting families but eventually they are drawn back to each other.
1255;this film is beautifully adapted from Ann Proulx's short story and is easily the best movie of 2005 (even though the Academy took the cowards route and gave the award to a lesser film).
1256;Thankfully they awarded the award for Best Director to Ang Lee and gave the Oscar for Best Score to Gustavo Santaolalla for his hauntingly beautiful score.
1257;it also recieved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay as well.
1258;Michelle Williams was also brilliant as Alma, Ennis' long suffering wife who realizes that her husband is in love with his best friend.
1259;The cinematography was incredible as well, like moving paintings of the western landscape.
1260;this film is bound to become a classic and will continue to be talked about for years to come.
1261;Love is love, straight or gay, and any film that makes us realize how import love is in our lives, is worth your attention.
1262;According to a famous dictum of Henry David Thoreau, most men lead lives of quiet desperation.
1263;The two men's lives subsequently diverge and both marry.
1264;while Ennis' marriage unravels when his wife becomes aware of his attachment to his buddy, Jack moves to Texas and, after sleeping with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, marries her and gets a comfortable job working for daddy.
1265;Nevertheless, the two manage to continue their liaison until Jack demands that Ennis live with him.
1266;the performances by Ledger and Gyllenhal are the movie's strongest asset.
1267;Otherwise Brokeback Mountain is a far from exceptional film.
1268;And a price always had to be paid whenever this transgression crossed the border back into civilization.
1269;The movie portrays a homosexual relationship, but it leaves the question of the sexuality of the two men up in the air.
1270;Throughout a long movie the two men directly address each other a handful times.
1271;a playwright who often depicted outsiders and a director with an incredible talent for transferring such figures to the screen.
1272;This movie broke my heart, it really did.
1273;This movie is about what true love is and should be .
1274;What they find is much more than just summer work
1275;After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.
1276;The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.
1277;Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.
1278;This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak.
1279;Brokeback Mountain, adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.
1280;It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).
1281;Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.
1282;They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.
1283;This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.
1284;Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty.
1285;Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways.
1286;It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.
1287;This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.
1288;This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.
1289;Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope.
1290;Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).
1291;For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent.
1292;wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's The Patriot, Monster's Ball
1293;Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.
1294;Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.
1295;Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.
1296;Williams proves that she is much more than just Dawson's Creek as the lonely and gentle Alma.
1297;Hathaway proves that she is much more than just The Princess Diaries as the sassy and feisty Lureen.
1298;Therefore, this is destined to become a classic.
1299;I waited to see this film divorced from the hype on it's initial release.
1300;Is this a great film?
1301;That's debatable but it is a very good one.
1302;I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.
1303;He allows the story to develope deliberately.
1304;Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.
1305;Another bonus is the splendid cinematography and the touching score.
1306;The cinematography is breathtaking, and the acting couldn't have been better if it were a documentary.
1307;This film just moved me to tears, every actor gave heart and soul to their performances.
1308;A wonderful testament to the human race.
1309;The audience is totally immersed in the film from beginning to end.
1310;The story is very touching and will probably make many men look at thier passing thoughts of other men more closely than before and make them understand the stigma of homosexuality is not what they had believed.
1311;You will totaly enjoy it coming out with a new view of the world.
1312;Who can approve two human beings can love or not love each other.
1313;wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing.
1314;motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day.
1315;as far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father.
1316;the murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U. s. communities today.
1317;At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.
1318;The movie has a lot going for it, as has been said , and said well, here and elsewhere.
1319;For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic.
1320;In this movie the guys are always crying.
1321;Thanks to all that made BM possible.
1322;out crowd in the theatre's largest auditorium, one of three screens that showed that film.
1323;Their friendship leads to a cold night in a pup tent, which sparks a passionate romp during which the two men have sex.
1324;The rest of the summer brought them closer and closer together.
1325;Of the two actors, Ledger rises far above the brilliant Gyllenhal, especially during a scene immediately after their scuffle in which Ennis must cope with the fact that he's truly in love, even if it's a forbidden love.
1326;the rest of the film is a montage of the lives of the two men over the next twenty years, and we're introduced to both of the characters' wives.
1327;Brokeback is clearly Ledger's shining moment, and Gyllenal's performance has its own passion.
1328;The chemistry between the two men is real, and the beauty of the cinematography is stunning.
1329;The power of love that's displayed in Brokeback is beyond borders, greater than fear, and brilliant even until that final frame.
1330;But it is a powerful love story as only Ang Lee could tell.
1331;In the end, Brokeback Mountain will bury itself into your heart as the force of nature it is.
1332;in the end, it's worth the time, the drive, and your ten bucks.
1333;This is the best movie ever made, and this collector's edition is wonderful.
1334;a simple story delivered with incredible emotion and conviction.
1335;stunning cinematography and remarkable performances.
1336;This is the best (film) love story since Out of Africa.
1337;the real life of this sweet, decent, unfulfilled man.
1338;(One particular moment of astonishingly good acting is when .
1339;without ever letting Ennis' shoulders come down, or his body to let free, Mr. Ledger laughs so sweetly
1340;It is some of the best acting you will ever see).
1341;Jake Gillenhaal is the perfect gem of a character that, in other circumstances, would have made the perfect love partner for Ledger's Ennis.
1342;All heart and love just emminates from him when .
1343;gives a deeply felt truth to the events she witnesses that must have torn her inner self assunder.
1344;From her first discovery of their shared passion to her final disclosure to her husband, she makes real the genuine loss that she has lived with.
1345;(I was completely flumoxed as to why Crash won best picture
1346;This is a must for all who believe that art is a reflection of life
1347;This film beautifully, sweetly, and emotionally holds the mirror right up to nature (as it were).
1348;This is a movie for all people to see and feel.
1349;It is a genuine .
1350;heart on it's sleeve .
1351;romance
1352;terrestrial or The Sixth Sense, in that it casts its spell so deliberately and carefully, you have to pay extra.
1353;special attention to it during the set.
1354;But when the dramatic moments come, they come like a prairie thunderbolt, and you realize with a shock how carefully Ang Lee and his brilliant cast (all sensational, but Ledger and Gyllenhall are iconic) have set up your expectations, have hooked you so throughly that you are hit as if it were a sucker punch.
1355;Again, this is a movie that fits Ang Lee's oeuvre of charcters at war between their inner passions and desires and a community that encourages conformity and self.
1356;denial
1357;But after a cautiously positive reaction seeing it the first time, I found myself seeing it again and being overwhelmed by its emotional impact, to the point where I actually think/thought about the characters as real people.
1358;This is a love story for the ages.
1359;It is with great reluctance that I write this review.
1360;I anticipated this movie with great enthusiasm as it was heralded as the next best thing since the wheel all over hollywood.
1361;Then came the nominations, and I was certain this was 'the one.'
1362;This picture is well acted and the cinematography is breath taking.
1363;Ang Lee is a very creative director and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are both extremely good actors.
1364;I lived through the violent years of being gay myself, and am very proud of the struggles and progress we have made.
1365;It is with my sincerest hope that this may help someone realize.
1366;There is more to life.
1367;Perhaps someday Hollywood will get this right.
1368;I was seriously impressed with both these actors
1369;I hope that they will choose well in the future because these are talented actors who deserve good roles in good movies.
1370;That being said, what this is is an extraordinarily GOOD movie.
1371;This is simply an extremely well written, photographed and acted love story were the two lovers happen to be men.
1372;i'll skip over the story, which I'm sure everyone should know by now, and explain why, in my opinion
1373;The dialog is extremely well written, and again, you have to pay close attention because you WILL miss things that will become important later in the movie.
1374;I found it fascinating how the character of Enis is not particularly likeable, but is far and away the most sympathetic character.
1375;Much has been made of the two female supporting actresses.
1376;And if you've never done that, bud you have issues and should NOT watch this movie!To sum up, this is a movie you have to make up your own mind about, but you really should watch.
1377;I found it a truly moving movie, beautifully photographed, extremely well written and with truly outstanding performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
1378;Never has such a movie touched so many.
1379;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall embodied the souls of every person denied the freedom to love.
1380;My husband and I are both straight yet were profoundly effected by its message of the power of love.
1381;It haunts my every dream.
1382;He absorbs the love of others like an emotional vampire and then wrings the people who love him dry.
1383;It is an amazingly artful depiction of a man completely divorced from.
1384;It explodes the myth that the strong silent type is a desirable life partner.
1385;the film is a chronicle of the fallout from loving the emotional recluse that is Ennis Delmar.
1386;well, to do something, I guess.
1387;For the rest of us who have been (im)patiently waiting to see an honest, adult depiction of a gay love story, this film is an overdue triumph.
1388;What Ennis chooses by allowing his life to go on, year after year, without making a choice to risk everything for love.
1389;heath Ledger as Ennis DelMar is obviously brilliant, as has been pointed out many times over.
1390;It's the yin and yang of the actor's portrayals that makes vivid the yin and yang of the men's love for each other.
1391;a perfect, beautiful movie in every possible way.
1392;An all time favorite for me.
1393;Silence speaks louder than words.
1394;brokeback Mountain is at once the most lyrical, powerful, inspirational, yet heart.
1395;wrenching film in a long time, without doubt one of the most important and greatest films of the last few decades.
1396;This is truly an exceptional achievement, a landmark film with an amazing story/script, outstanding and exceptional acting, masterful direction, unhurried and controlled pace, breathtaking cinematography, simple yet excellent and beautiful music, and most importantly, unprecedented emotional impact.
1397;Its treatment of human nature, loneliness, longing for love, self.
1398;repression, intolerance, is done with admirable subtlety and sensitivity.
1399;This story is simply universal.
1400;Images of this film and stirring emotions will haunt you for days and weeks.
1401;This is an extraordinary deeply moving film.
1402;simply unforgettable!Brokeback Mountain is a rare work of art in which silence speaks louder than words.
1403;Eyes and smiles can be very eloquent.
1404;Yet, this is surely one the most powerful and probably one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinematic history for its meaning and emotional impact.
1405;love speaks louder than words.
1406;Ang Lee realizes the full power of image in his exploration of the most intimate human emotions.
1407;life characters and, thanks of course to the unforgettable and heartbreaking performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, Ennis and Jack now live forever, they are now undeniably part of the American literary and cinematic culture.
1408;Rarely did a film have such a strong impact on society, in the media, and with the general public.
1409;event and most important film of 2005 despite the inexplicable absence of an Oscar for Best Picture to its already impressive crown.
1410;it's sad to say, but the recent disgraceful Oscar scandal proved how important and necessary this film is, and how many boundaries there are still to be conquered.
1411;This film is not pushing a specific moral, instead, it makes us think, it makes us feel, it makes us reflect on the true meaning and value of our lives.
1412;i think I'm use to seeing more affection between two people in love as well.
1413;Since I would like to enjoy and appreciate every movie and feel privileged to read the heart felt comments I received from many individuals, I have gladly viewed the film again.
1414;There is definitely something for everyone in BBM.
1415;Heath Ledger (as Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack) are at the very least attractive and vulnerable, two of many elements common with falling in love.
1416;The men work together and a close friendship is formed.
1417;They simply want to live and have some kind of life in this world.
1418;The way anyone can feel they are a part of or the soul mate to another.
1419;the complexity and intricacy of each character, the acting of everyone in the film including the depicted societal constrains during that era is outstanding.
1420;The cinematography throughout the film is commendable as well.
1421;i thank those that patiently wanted to understand my point of view in initially not liking the film and feverishly documenting there own views.
1422;Any director deserves the Oscar when able to depict an otherwise very common story, in an outstanding way, full of symbols that haunt with melancholy.
1423;Anyone who has heard this tale, goes knowing the twists and turns.
1424;make the men cowboys for cultural iconic shock effect, a tool for marketing writers.
1425;put them in a paradise, to help create a romantic mood.
1426;Again, the story is told well, but if on top of that you use a paradise as the background, people are goingto root for Oscar.
1427;A beautiful and powerful movie.
1428;Heath and Jake and Michelle and Anne do a beautiful job.
1429;Love it and loved the ground it broke, love is love no matter what.
1430;Thought the subject matter was dealt with in deep respect.
1431;Maybe director Ang Lee's approach is a little too detached for this material and also the writing had too many questions unanswered for me to fully enjoy this film.
1432;Sorry but Crash though not a perfect film really deserved the Best Picture Oscar.
1433;The love sence is tasteful and respectful.
1434;This movie is truly a tear jerker
1435;average movie but not worthy of best picture.
1436;A second rate love story that has gained notroiety by being about gay love.
1437;So many people that I know have stopped themselves from seeing this movie because of the hot.
1438;button issue it presents to its viewers.
1439;This is such a beautifully done movie, from the transcription of the short story to the silver screen to the expansive shots.
1440;Their acting is absolutely superb, and came completely from the heart.
1441;i felt like I was right there with them, experiencing what they felt.
1442;It's heartbreaking, it's wonderful, and it's impossible to live without, and this movie shows that rollercoaster ride perfectly.
1443;i enjoy watching westerns too, and I don't think that this destroyed any of the wonderful history that westerns have.
1444;i have a new respect for how tough real cowboys are, after seeing the work these two ranch hands had to accomplish for practically no pay!
1445;all in all, this is a heart warming story that's wonderfully told and done.
1446;while I thought the story was good, I never thought it could be retold this well on the silver screen.
1447;Honestly one of the best book.
1448;Great casting, believable acting and breathtaking shots.
1449;This obviously came from a simple minded man who believe that men are superior than women, and that men should become those alien creatures with no emotions we see everyday!
1450;Just because this film shows spirituality does not mean that these people are mommie's boys, and if they are, I think a world full of these people will be better than a world full of you!
1451;What I like best about this movie is that I can see the story played out thousands of times in real life.
1452;Because the story is excellent.
1453;Because it shows the debth of what love can be.
1454;Because this is real life.
1455;From an artistic standpoint, it really delivers.
1456;But you're in for a real treat.
1457;Everything about this movie is perfect.
1458;the breathtaking cinematography, the touching,simple score that contrasts with the complex feelings of the characters, the brilliant acting, and the flawless script.
1459;What I love about this movie is that it is so so complex, the characters, including the wives, are so incredibly rich.
1460;Lee has truly created a GEM of a movie.
1461;I will say this however, I loved the movie even more the second time, I just noticed so many more things.
1462;the two men in this movie fall in love with each other in the purest form that the word can ever mean.
1463;we all wish for a love so deep and meaningful and some of us are lucky enough to find it once or twice in our lives.
1464;if you take anything from this film it is a new definition of the meaning of love and life and how short our time on Earth is.
1465;nice to see that Heath did eventually win an Oscar posthumously.
1466;This is a beautifully told love story with complex characters in a complex situation.
1467;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are just brilliant as Ang Lee's telling of the story and David Campbell's haunting music.
1468;while the love story is the at the core, what I got from BBM was the lesson of dreams denied.
1469;This movie has caused me to delve deep within myself and rediscover my dreams, and it has set me on a path to pursue those dreams and to become true.
1470;For that, I thank all involved with this wonderful, deeply touching story.
1471;the acting in this movie was gobsmackingly fantastic.
1472;his performance was achingly wonderful.
1473;Jake Gyllenhaal was the perfect balance of exuberance and dreamer.
1474;his portrayal of Jack's firm belief of the ability of his and Ennis' love to triumph if just given the chance was heartbreaking.
1475;Anne Hathaway was the perfect Texas wife .
1476;i'm a Wyoming native, born and raised, and though just a bit younger than the characters of the movie, I did grow up in 1960's .
1477;1980's Wyoming (the era of the story) and I grew up with those types of people .
1478;the grand vistas of Wyoming (yeah, I know it was filmed in Alberta, Canada, but it was set in Wyoming), especially of Brokeback Mountain (which I interpret as being in the Big Horn Mountains), formed the perfect backdrop for the heart of the love story.
1479;it lives on its own in the majestic bosom of the mountains .
1480;the pull of those mountains is strong.
1481;it lasts a lifetime .
1482;but into the mountains, where the beauty of that world shone a soft, safe light on their relationship.
1483;but in the mountains, they could hold it close and keep it safe.
1484;Moral of the story: ~Be true to yourself.
1485;be true to your dreams.
1486;The real power of the story is that this love came from the unlikeliest source
1487;I have never been so moved by anything, either on film or in the written word as I was by this story.
1488;It would seem the best talent in the industry went into its making.
1489;, Jake Gyllenhaal (also astounding), Michelle Williams and the haunting score to name a few.
1490;Probably the most poignant scene I have ever seen in a movie is the scene where Jack (Jake) is standing at a campfire, hands in his pockets, Ennis (Heath) walks up and wraps his arms around him from behind, just holding him and gently rocking, their eyes closed.
1491;Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.
1492;In a beautifully crafted run.
1493;In the film it's easy to see how everyone thought they were returning every year when Jack, in an argument with Ennis at their last meeting, gestured behind him and said 'all we have is Brokeback Mountain'.
1494;After that summer they both moved on to marriages, children and in Jack's case, other men (which was probably the start of his downfall in Texas, word getting out in the rodeo circuit).
1495;There was a light that shone from Jack that's heartbreaking to watch each time his hopes were dashed.
1496;Ennis always loved him deeply and didn't fully realize that depth until he found the 2 shirts from their Brokeback Mountain days carefully hidden by Jack years ago in his boyhood home.
1497;he now knew Jack was the love of his life.
1498;I really appreciated it as a work of art and social commentary.
1499;It tells a great story without having to say a whole lot.
1500;In my opinion, this is where the movie shines most.
1501;The acting is very good.
1502;The love affair transcends decades despite no communication between them except for a few words on a post card to setup a trip together.
1503;Unfortuenately this needless bickering overshadows the story of the film, which is a story of love, longing, and raw human passion.
1504;That one love that creeps into your life and blindsides you, completely unexpected.
1505;The whole scene is shot with such authenticity on the part of the actors that you feel like the characters do.
1506;She is more about what is true grit, hard life, pure human emotion rather it is wrong or right and often the wrong and right are very blurred in her stories.
1507;I feel that Ang Lee did great justice to the original story by being able to visually blur those same lines.
1508;the acting in the movie is superb.
1509;coated sense of just what love is.
1510;He's a man of few words, and even less emotion.
1511;Ledger's performance as Ennis is spot on.
1512;His quiet but rough nature is perfectly conveyed, especially in the reunion kiss scene between he and Gyllenhaal.
1513;You get a real sense of the character emotion that carries throughout the movie.
1514;I found myself empathizing with Ennis's you.
1515;That kind of audience empathy speaks volumes for Ledger's portrayal.
1516;jack Twist is a more emotionally charged character.
1517;He knows he loves Ennis, and is happy for it.
1518;Jake Gyllenhaal embodies the rugged showman that is Jack.
1519;Gyllenhaal puts the perfect spin on this character dynamic.
1520;He's funny, emotional, loving, yet rough and antagonistic.
1521;To genuinely portray such a multifaceted character is an attribute to Mr. Gyllenhaal's acting abilities.
1522;Jake and Heath reach that level with ease in this movie.
1523;i would recommend this movie to anyone, even my boss who swears that this movie has made John Wayne turn in his grave.
1524;I think as an actor and an artist, and most of all as a human being, even good ol' Mr. Wayne would know the brilliance of this movie.
1525;This movie awakened a part of my soul that had been sleeping for a while, and for that I am eternally grateful to Annie Prolux for putting it out there on paper, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana for so genuinely rewriting it so it could hit the big screen, to Ang Lee for his brilliant vision and insight into human passion, and of course to the actors for bringing all of Prolux's rough.
1526;fantastic film with great acting by two guys I typically can't stand.
1527;besides, ALL cowboy movies are gay, this one is just honest about it.
1528;I felt this movie right to my core .
1529;Jake Gyllenhall was outstanding as Jack twist and brought his character to life with such emotion , those eyes of his really impacted the character, he has such soulful, loving eyes.
1530;The story itself is quite a journey, and if you can open your heart and empathize just a tiny bit you'll find it both devistating and captivating.
1531;but beyond the story itself, this movie has so many layers of meaning and subtlety that Ang Lee and the incredible cast have added to the amazing screenplay.
1532;For Ennis, love is a post traumatic stress disorder.
1533;freshly enough killed that Dad might have been a material witness, at least.
1534;Mom lets Ennis take the package, sending her son's loving soul home with Ennis.
1535;He has an address, so he must exist!
1536;Both of these reviewers know the two men in Brokeback Mountain are in love, and that it is an incredible love story.
1537;This is a incredible movie, and we all know it.
1538;Warm, touching and inspiring, Brokeback shares many similarities to last years masterpiece Million Dollar Baby.
1539;They just move you in a profound way while showing you two people are capable of changing each others lives.
1540;in Million dollar baby, Frankie and Maggie have nothing, no family, nothing, but together they form a wonderful father daughter relationship which changes each others lives.
1541;Frankie doesn't just turn Maggie into a great boxer, but Maggie revives Frankie's ability to connect with someone.
1542;they both help each other psychically and emotionally.
1543;Two people can make life worth living and both masterpieces have taught me that.
1544;I have now made a connection with a wonderful girl at my school thanks to these two masterpieces.
1545;I have seen the light of human connection.
1546;i'm glad my favorite movie of 05 has made it's mark on so many people.
1547;The best film of 05 and perhaps this century.
1548;No stars can justify my love for this film.
1549;Having read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panaromic Wyoming backdrop was told.
1550;The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.
1551;the union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.
1552;He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strifes set against the magnificent mountain view.
1553;the assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight.
1554;jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of a couple of high.
1555;shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation.
1556;Williams' acting powress is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heartwrenching exchange with Ledger.
1557;Given her short screentime, her change from a brash rich rodeo queen to a high.
1558;society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary.
1559;ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go.
1560;To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre.
1561;again affair lasting several years.
1562;the film is quiet and powerful.
1563;The score and backdrops are sweeping and majestic.
1564;However one feels about the subject matter, this is a great film.
1565;its Reactions:I have found the reactions to this film to be quite surprising.
1566;And we can see in the reviews of this film here on Amazon (and the helpful/unhelpful votes) that it has provoked something intense and deeply.
1567;it is my opinion that love is love (though, so the reader understands my personal context, I am both a straight man and politically conservative).
1568;I understand that some others feel that the portrayal of homosexual love is part of some agenda.
1569;obviously, this was an important movie to make.
1570;And so, to those who've seen the film and still wish to attack it, I actually want to thank you: while I disagree with what you believe, and the reasons you have for your attacks, its good that we have a chance to talk about it.
1571;five stars for the film itself and five stars for the important discussion it has launched.
1572;This is a beautiful film.
1573;The screenplay is perfect, the cinematography is beautiful, direction perfect and perfomances are all stellar.
1574;lee did a marvelous job with this film.
1575;It's a true, pure, love story for the ages.
1576;Every cast member is perfect.
1577;Ledger acts like I nver imagined he could, Gillenhall is charming, Williams and Hathaway are heartbreaking.
1578;this is a film that deserves a much bigger audience than it will ever get, but I dare you to see it and leave unmoved.
1579;beautiful scenery, a stirring love story and brilliant acting .
1580;This is the fourth time I have viewed this movie with its enchanting scenery and music and slow.
1581;I adore this film and recommend it to anyone.
1582;He takes a job as a rancher and meets Jack.
1583;The two men bond like good friends.
1584;They soon find themselves embroiled in passion.
1585;connect after time has passed they continue their hidden love.
1586;Brokeback Mountain is a good movie, a little overhyped, a little soft porn, but a great story about two men living on The DL.
1587;This movie was very good.
1588;I think it deserves a lot of attention from the awards for best movie and actor.
1589;It is probably the best of the year and richly deserved the praises heaped upon it, contrary to Fox News' dismissal of the film in favor of King Kong.
1590;Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece and the best Western (yes, it is a Western) romance I have ever seen.
1591;What a great transcultural, transgender,transunderstanding piece of cinematography.
1592;Whether you are gay, straight, or undecided, this is a story about love, the emotion, removing all sexual connotations from its definition.
1593;It is the form of love that could happen between two men, as it is represented in the movie, but in its broader sense it is the form of love that can happen between any two people.
1594;It is easy to empathize with the loveless wife who sits in the shadows, but maybe one should look at the suffering of all three leads.
1595;To it all add beautiful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack.
1596;If you are watching it with the one you love, or wishing for a love so pure, then watch it.
1597;it is very inspirational on many levels.

1601;crossed lovers, but at least that reminded me of the greatest love story of them all.
1602;The movie does raise some interesting questions however: Were there any gay people involved in the scripting or making of this film?
1603;Leaving us finally to deal with message of the movie's sub.
1604;This is the message I got from this movie, When your atop a mountain and your all alone or your married it's okay to screw your buddy, because it's okay to be gay.
1605;You have to be honest with yourselves.
1606;I was hoping to see a beautiful love story that would have helped me understand the love and connection gay people feel.
1607;Will and Grace demonstrates a better example.
1608;this is a testament to the type of hold love can have on people, especially when it comes from the most unexpected places.
1609;ennis is the prime example of this thinking.
1610;he is a very simple man, but on the inside he is full of conflict.
1611;everything is very basic and straightforward, he knows what he can and cant do.
1612;that is the truest statement in the movie.
1613;this movies gathers it's power from basic human needs.
1614;the fact that each man realizes that the love they share is pure is also the root of their torment.
1615;both men hold onto the love that they share.
1616;both of their lives would be simpler if they could let each other go but love in its most basic form will not release them from it's bonds.
1617;everything about this movie is moving.
1618;i do not mean that he does not do a good job, he is excellent as ennis del mar. however, there are two actors in this movie and jake gyllenhall deserves just as much praise as ledger.
1619;i think that this movies stands a very good chance to capture the oscar for best picture and i think that it would be a great day if a movie dealing with gay issues of this magnitude would be step forward in the constant war of equal rights.

1632;The love between the men is genuine.
1633;This is a beautifully filmed movie with outstanding performances.
1634;After seeing it, it is no wonder that CRASH won for Best Picture.
1635;It never really gets you emotionally involved with the characters.
1636;I really think that because of the times, the film got more attention than it deserved.
1637;an attempt: beautifully filmed, incredibly acted, leaves you connected with the human condition, love, hate and the dreams that never quite come true.
1638;I like this movie very much.
1639;in spite of excellent performances from Heath Ledger (who looks like the Marlboro Man to the tee) and Jake Gyllenhaal, a strong script, and some gorgeous cinematography of the beautiful Wyoming landscape.

1642;so the female characters were much more interesting: Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and especially the gorgeous Kate Mara.
1643;What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor.

1659;The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's The Motorcycle Diaries.

1679;It's unfortunate because Brokeback is an excellent film, and it's an incredible story of heartbreak and loss.
1680;Brokeback Mountain is both epic and intimate.
1681;The final shot of Ledger's face is as haunting as that of Giulietta Masina's in Nights of Cabiria.
1682;This is one of those movies where everything just comes together so well, (the music, the cinematography, the acting, the mood) that your faith that good movies can still be made is renewed.
1683;I think this is a wonderful love story that displays the biases in our society, preventing select groups of people from being whom they truly are.
1684;In my opinion, this is a great movie for all to see.
1685;As well, this highlights the late Heath Ledger as a daring and talented actor.
1686;A broken mold this movie is with Hollywood finally taking a chance in this direction for a mainstream film.
1687;And what they have done together is SUPERB.
1688;What a beautful and heartbreaking ( it hurts so good ) gift he has given us.
1689;This movie is the definition of love whoever you are.
1690;Every time I watch this film it breaks my heart.
1691;It is one of the most moving I have ever see.
1692;Wonderful work by two young actors.
1693;One night they are shocked to discover that their friendship had transformed them into lovers.
1694;this film is amazing in every sense of the word.
1695;It is beautifully directed and executed.
1696;The stunning cinematography displays the stark beauty of the American wilderness that mirrors the wild, untamed love between Ennis and Jack.
1697;heath and Jake's performances were legendary.
1698;I honestly have never seen better performances from two straight male actors in terms of heartrending, accurate portrayals of homosexual men during a critical time of the history of American society.
1699;This is a story that is moving and haunting.
1700;It stays with you and reverberates through your soul for a long time.
1701;It is a movie that will continue to affect me because it revealed to me the brutality of human nature, and how love is so powerful that it has the might to act simultaneously as salvation and destruction to so many lives.
1702;I've seen many films in my time and been moved by many.
1703;I and a great number of people I know.
1704;Brokeback reaches deep into the spirit to touch the existential loneliness we all feel, however loved we may feel ourselves in this life.
1705;not even the estimable Ang Lee could have gotten that out of an actor less supremely talented
1706;All of the women are amazing, right down to the waitress who fruitlessly falls in love with Ennis.
1707;The extras are skimpy but fine.
1708;Thanks to everyone concerned with giving us this deeply realized work of art.
1709;Simply the best film of 2005, and that was quite a strong year in films.
1710;But try, and you will be rewarded with a moving experience that will stay with you for a long time.
1711;Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are all magnificent in their portrayals.
1712;And finally the fantastic music!
1713;Gustavo Santaolalla's score is so achingly spare and beautiful, wonderfully evoking the mood of the film.
1714;Saw it in the theater and was a bit let down.
1715;After seeing the movie Brokeback Mountain, I was truly moved by the powerful love story between the two main characters, Jack and Ennis.
1716;To me, there is nothing more refreshing than a movie that takes a risk.
1717;This film was beautifully captivating in every way, and certainly portrays what it is to be in love, no matter what the circumstance.
1718;Ang Lee's masterful craftmenship of the movie engage the viewers so much in the story that people are not aware that it was only from a short story.
1719;there's passion, yearning and heartaches in this epic story.
1720;One of the best real life drama adaptations I've so far seen.
1721;A great movie it was to my point of view.
1722;i am a very tough to please and satify expectator and even when I wasn't completely thrilled by the speed in which the film states out it's objective, I got to see Very good acting and a very well sought out script.
1723;in wich ever manner it comes.
1724;Hatred stirs up dissension but Love will cover up multitude of sins.
1725;Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece that lingers with you long after the movie is over.
1726;Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis is excellent.
1727;Ennis allows his fear of what this love means if anyone finds out, to color the way he walks, talks, and ages.
1728;ang Lee orchestrated this thing that happened to these people beautifully.
1729;The passion between these two men that spans twenty years is as sweeping as the landscapes.
1730;As I was watching the movie, I felt happiness, lust, love, sadness, anger, emptiness and finally lonliness.
1731;It didn't matter that it was two men, those human emotions touch all .
1732;You truly felt their attraction and love for each other and you wanted them to finally be able to stay together.
1733;I'm glad I was along for the ride.
1734;I knew what the plotline was, I knew where it took place and I knew that I wanted to see it.
1735;the performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are phenomonal.
1736;He plays Jack with such passion and vivaciousness that its hard not to cry when he tells Ennis that He can't quit him.
1737;it is an excellent movie.
1738;Their romance continues over the years, hidden they believe, from those around them.
1739;page short story by Annie Proulx way back, and found it an enjoyable read.
1740;it's a great story, and the screen adaptation is about as good as it can be.
1741;Both Gyllenhaal and Ledger do an outstanding job in their roles as Jack and Ennis (Gyllenhaal hasn't gotten the credit he deserves for this, in my opinion), and their supporting cast, particularly Williams as Alma, Ennis' wife, do an extraordinary job of showing that not only Jack and Ennis are suffering from their predicament.
1742;By the end, I was a bit eager to see the credits roll.
1743;If you gave the film more than 3 stars, I highly recommend the book.
1744;I have not yet read the short story but I have seen the movie and it truly is a tragic love story.
1745;My word of advice for your first time watching this film, bring some tissues.
1746;This film is a great Alternative Love story that can touch your heart if your willing to keep an open mind.
1747;This film has won several awards, and is well worth the cost of owning it.
1748;However if you are an open minded hopless romantic then you will love this wonderfull film.
1749;The first thing that grabbed my attention, was the sheer brilliance in cinematography.
1750;The landscape and surroundings of Brokeback Mountain is extremely detailed and rich in colour.
1751;The story continues with their relationship as they both turn seperate ways and try to live their lives, resisting the urge to be together.
1752;their are terrific performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall (spelt wrong, I know), as they struggle with their lives.
1753;overall, this was an OK film, and a film that everyone would enjoy.
1754;Great scenery, great story, great screenplay.
1755;one of the top movies for 2005 easily.
1756;And this doesnt seem to be the kind of love we have today.
1757;This is soulmate, eternal love.
1758;the kind that seems it will go on for ever.
1759;(And Heath Ledger's acting in this part was incredible).
1760;This movie has really made an impact on the people who have seen it.
1761;Not all movies have to be action packed to be good.
1762;An excellent movie I think.
1763;i believe in love and I believe that what you are watching here happens all the time all over the world.
1764;i think it's important that our world gives more importance to this four letters RAVE (respect appreciate value everyone) Because this movie is acctualy telling us the possible results of someone who is not ready to be trully himself because of the fears of the society.
1765;hope you like it as much as I do.
1766;it's kindda sad at the end but very good movie though.
1767;The movie is very moving.
1768;It could be about any two people in love who fight it for any reason and marry other people for financial or other reasons of convenience, only to realize later their love for each other is strong, passionate and real .
1769;a love for a lifetime.
1770;I know I really liked and was very moved by this film, and I'm equally sure that the performances were superb.
1771;This is a very touching, tragic film about circumstances and events which have happened to many lives, I'm sure, and I feel I'll be better able to write an honest review of it after I've re.
1772;This film deserved to be named Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
1773;I finally found a time to go to the theater and see the film and once again, I was left in thought.
1774;If you want to see a movie that actually leaves you thinking
1775;then you simply must see this film.
1776;BBM definately deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and what makes me mad is that I really liked Crash, but thanks to the Academy I cant watch it without thinking, how could they choose this over a masterpiece like Brokeback.
1777;so most of you already know the story so I'll tell you about how this film affected me.
1778;My girlfriend wanted to go see this movie last week and I was actually pretty excited.
1779;So we went and after the movie was over there were of course people crying but I didnt know what to feel, I thought the ending sucked but the acting was pretty good.
1780;Brokeback is a movie that definately touches you, not because its a gay romance, but because its a beautiful parable about loneliness, love, and what it means to be a man.
1781;BBM definately does a lot of good in showing a more realistic side to the gay community.
1782;Likewise almost everyone has that doubt that Ennis has, that wish that you had done something to make you happy instead of making everyone else happy, wheter its pursuing a relationship, career, or dream, we all have our regrets in life.
1783;the acting is phenominal, Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest screen preformances in history as Ennis Del Mar.
1784;Phillip Hoffman won the Oscar this year and I really liked his preformance, but Heath has so little to work with and yet is so heart wrenching.
1785;He's able to convey so much by just saying Jack, I swear than most actors could show in a whole film.
1786;Its a tough preformance that you have to see more than once to truly appreciate but Jake nails it perfectly.
1787;gay film, or at least would be if the scenes between Jack and Ennis didnt show that these two men obviously love each other completely, and I was raised Catholic, I believe god loves every one of us and gay people are born that way, and I think theyre put on this earth to teach us what real love is.
1788;Heath Ledger as a lonesome cowboy issimply breathtaking.
1789;His pain and sadness, expressed with few wordsand gestures is absolutely heartbreaking.
1790;It is amazing, how a twentysomething year old man understands such a complex character and heshows it in every single gesture.
1791;ang Lee's images are extremely powerful.
1792;i love his understated and subtle style of directing.
1793;there is a lot of silence, but the atmosphere is always intense and emotionally charged.
1794;this is a terrific movie!
1795;Well boy howdy
1796;At the same time however, I thought the cinematography was stunning
1797;gradually I opened up to the story and the way it was presented, and lo and behold, by the end of the film I felt it worthy of the praise it has received.
1798;And Ang Lee's direction turned my early.
1799;on yawns into rapt attention.
1800;But that's a discussion for another day.
1801;This is a classic, bittersweet story about two men finding a special kind of love together in spite of their every day lives.
1802;It shed knew light and understanding on some of the relationships I've been blessed by in my past and ones I will cherish my whole life.
1803;I'm sure I'll watch this story again and again.
1804;I have a lot more I could say, but out of respect for everyone I will hold back.
1805;I do have the right to like or dislike who ever or what ever I want just as you do.
1806;They are actually cast well as people from this time in the West.
1807;Soon they realize they both have a fondness for each other.
1808;They also realize they are going to be going their seperate ways.
1809;What is great about this movie is the story is something anyone can identify with regardless of their sexual preference.
1810;The film is also good in showing us lives of other people like their wives and families.
1811;some people thought the movie was slow but I honestley thought the pacing was perfect.
1812;Movies that move slow, if done right, are great because it gives us time to absorb the settings and characters within the timeline.
1813;If written well, as this movie is, we don't fall asleep, but are instead captivated again, by the story.
1814;There are also beautiful scenic shots throughout the movie.
1815;A quiet and friendly environment that had people in it whose inner feelings are strong and yet hidden.
1816;I encourage anyone to watch it.
1817;Its not about a certain lifestyle, but about life, love and the pursuit of happiness which sometimes is found, in one way or another.
1818;this movie is a masterpiece for emotion, drama, and ideas.
1819;the cinamtography is outstanding and backgoung music was also outstanding.
1820;god made us all in his image.
1821;to live love and respect each other.
1822;Besides Ang Lee, the director of Brokeback Mountain, winning the Best Director Oscar, a racially diverse movie called In the Heat of the Night won the Best Picture Oscar.
1823;i watched nevertheless, to show that I do keep an open mind about the subject.
1824;But by the end of the film, even I had tears in my eyes.
1825;Love between two men is expressed the same way as love between a man and a woman.
1826;The dynamics are exactly the same.
1827;winning film already, and looks set for some sort of Oscar recognition.
1828;The film has garnered more Oscar nominations than any other this year.
1829;There is much more depth here than in the film, much more about the interior workings of the main characters and what they must endure.
1830;One comes to wonder at the resistance that all characters seem to have for breaking free of their bonds
1831;the closet theme is heightened in the lead characters, but in fact serves as a metaphor for readers who might not fit in that particular closet .
1832;this theme is played in out in several scenes of the film .
1833;the last scene is perhaps the most powerful of all, drifting to a final image.
1834;in terms of overall cinematography, this is a beautiful film.
1835;Ang Lee's direction has provided wonderful panoramic views of the mountains and the plains, the not.
1836;wild west of America, mid.
1837;'Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.
1838;Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Jack as the ants.
1839;energy bronco buster cowboy is also very enthralling.
1840;Jack's passion for many things comes through, and through the film we come to discover (as Ennis comes to discover) that this passion comes with a high price.
1841;Both want 'regular' lives, and both discover there is more to their husbands' relationship than fishing.
1842;sacred genre of the American Western also adds to the heightened interest .
1843;there is no happy ending to this film .
1844;I found bits of the music score coming back to me for days afterwards, and each time this happened, I would feel a bit more sombre, and a little bit lost for words.
1845;The original themes by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marcelo Zarvos are very well done, and this is a soundtrack I mean to get.
1846;Was very pleased with timing of order, and also very pleased with overall packaging of product.
1847;line, but thanks to AMAZON i'll continue ordering great films.
1848;Probably the best movie this year.
1849;Great story and not because of the gay cowboy storyline.
1850;The scenery is amazing and the acting is truly award winning.
1851;Definietly recommend this movie to others.
1852;I dont know if its because of growing up in the country living on a farm, or my time as a rodeo clown but this movie touched me on many levels.
1853;Approach it as an experiment.
1854;this truly has to be one of the best movies i have ever seen.
1855;ang lee should be very proud of his direction on this movie.
1856;he has made an instant classic.
1857;It is true that the story concerns an on.
1858;It is a powerful film, an artful film.
1859;It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.
1860;Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities.
1861;As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship.
1862;Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words I love you never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one.
1863;Both men marry
1864;in terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted.
1865;Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way.
1866;He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography.
1867;The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish.
1868;Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make.
1869;Is it a great masterpiece?
1870;Brokeback Mountain is a powerful a movie that takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller.
1871;It is simply a love story.
1872;Our prospective families and children love us both.
1873;We made the right choice and the movie is the right choice!!!!
1874;Unlike hiding love and loosing that love without resolution as in the movie, we will be buried together and God loves us too.
1875;It's still on my mind.
1876;This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1877;Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale.
1878;They gradually became friends and then special friends.
1879;The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch.
1880;We were both choked up by the emotional impact.
1881;We discussed it for the next several months, however.
1882;The movie was that powerful.
1883;The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention.
1884;This film is amazing and very powerful.
1885;This film deserves a lot more respect than some of the coarse remarks in certain viewer reviews.
1886;My partner and I went to see the movie twice.
1887;As a once married man now in a gay relationship I can relate to both characters.
1888;This is a movie EVERYONE should see.
1889;It's a sensitive and non.
1890;All of the straight folks I have talked to who have seen the movie said that it opened their eyes about how gay people can feel the same emotions they do and how universal love is.
1891;It clearly should have won as the directing and acting was magnificent!
1892;Get it more publicity and out of the closet so everyone can enjoy it.
1893;Fantastic scenery, excellent casting, wonderful soundtrack, and a storyline as beautiful as it is controversial makes Brokeback Mountain a classic before its time.
1894;I found my self both empathizing and sympathizing with Ennis and Jack on their quest to happiness.
1895;The last film I cried in was The Notebook, another credit to everlasting love.
1896;Heath and Jake were perfectly matched in their roles.
1897;This film is a must.
1898;see it for what it is worth .
1899;i point out all of this, because it appears as though people have now started to come to their senses and give movies a chance to move them reguardless of their content.
1900;a special about it on the LOGO network made me want to see it even more.
1901;well, it finally came here, I saw it and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait.
1902;i have rarely been moved by a story, either in film or in print, as much as I was moved by this movie.
1903;please tell all of your friends to open their minds and hearts and see this film, I think many of them will be surprised.
1904;Then I read the novella on which it is based and found that much more sympathetic and, actually, quite touching.
1905;Jet also carries the story forward into decades after the times of the action recounted in the original novella and in the film.
1906;Jet's new novelisation needs to be taken on its own terms, of course, but I recommend it to other readers.
1907;Whether the original novella or the motion picture, repeated viewings and readings do help for the tale's message to sink into one's conscious memories of it, and Jet's full.
1908;length novelisation helps that further.
1909;director Ang Lee shows this in a very subtle, subdued manner which is one of the best films assets.
1910;And the movie grows on you and the effect stays long after you've watched it.
1911;Brokeback Mountain is a film of epic proportions!
1912;All involved in this project should be extremely proud of themselves.
1913;Maybe that's part of the reason that this film is so fantastic.
1914;It's about the far more realistic .
1915;Ennis knows what awaits them if they dare openly face their dark side.
1916;at Brokeback Mountain for a week or so a couple times a year and they maintain their passionate love affair.
1917;Ledger, who up until now, I thought was a light weight pretty boy, delivers a tour de force performance.
1918;He's the quiet, yet very much NOT the introspective man.
1919;He swallows his words but you can see every thought as it rolls across his face.
1920;towards the end of the film, is palpable.
1921;This actress is masterful and mature and you certainly can feel her pain.
1922;Her face tells the whole story.
1923;Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway also deliver absolutely phenomenal performances.
1924;This is a vehicle for some of the best performances you'll ever see on film .
1925;But as Jack says, I guess ol' Brokeback really got us good.
1926;They are bound to each other.
1927;He wants to take us along the road with each of his characters to the most complete of jumping off points.
1928;He wants us to fully understand them.
1929;And his past efforts are certainly example enough of how masterful this director is.
1930;I'll grant him his extra time so long as he continues to show us the true emotional center of characters, instead of relegating an entire character's reason for being to a single line of dialogue as many American films do.
1931;Lee's films are much more realistic and allow the audience to truly connect with the characters.
1932;One of the best movies ever made, hands down.
1933;There is a poetry in the way this film is constructed.
1934;Ang Lee once again creates a masterpiece on screen with yet another angst.
1935;the cinematography is absolutely stunning.
1936;The soundtrack is quiet, simple and honest.
1937;The actors are perfectly cast and well.
1938;I was quite surprised by Anne Hathaway's performance.
1939;She nails the Texas accent and the attitude of a wife whose marriage very quickly became a loveless convenience.
1940;this is a very good story, well filmed and by far Ang Lee's best work to date.
1941;Meant only for the maturest and most open minds.
1942;it's good the first time, but amazing the second.
1943;Most of the emotion and story is found between the lines, unfolding almost like a mystery.
1944;Paying closer attention on second viewing reveals a great deal of importance that happened off screen, and changes how you interpret various scenes.)
1945;One doesn't usually expect such subtle intricacies that require multiple viewings from a drama/romance, but the revelations and new understandings you do get from a second or even third viewing of Brokeback are greatly rewarding.
1946;This is partly because of the tremendous nuance in the story and performances, and partly because of the clever order in which things are revealed.
1947;Because so much is masked and unspoken among the characters, the whole truth or underlying emotion of many moments are veiled from us until long afterward.
1948;I strongly recommend seeing it again.
1949;when in the theaters, some folks praised or panned Brokeback merely for its subject matter, but both agendas belittle the greatness and scope of the film.
1950;It's an expertly told and gorgeously shot subtle drama about the irrepressible power of both love and fear.
1951;heath Ledger's aching performance is mesmerizing.
1952;The New York Times rightly compared it to the best of Brando and Penn.
1953;and that restraint is what allows us to discover new layers each time we see the film.
1954;and at times so little of his face, as Ennis likes to hide his eyes beneath the safe brim of his hat, making his direct glances all the more potent.
1955;Add to that the subtle ways his voice and body change as he ages 20 years, and you have a performance that I suspect will go down in film history as one of the greats.
1956;jake Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist is a little less hidden, also delivers a stellar performance of alternately bottled up pathos and spurts of idealism.
1957;Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway shine equally bright as Alma and Lureen.
1958;Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have so faithfully adapted and artfully expanded Proulx's story in their Oscar.
1959;winning screenplay that Proulx said she felt like they (and the other filmmakers) had reached inside her head.
1960;winning score by Gustavo Santaollala (whose score for 2004's The Motorcycle Diaries is another of my favorites) is appropriately spare, haunting, and beautifully evocative.
1961;I do wish it were longer, but it's all the film needed and is definitely worth getting once you've seen the movie.
1962;rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is gorgeous, from the breathtaking mountain expanses to the muted indoor scenes wherein the light is as simple and evocative as the story.
1963;Prieto is as gifted with natural (or natural.
1964;seeming) light as the great Rodger Deakins.
1965;As well done as it is, it's ultimately just a simple tale about a handful of average folks struggling with their emotions.
1966;Which is another reason that a second or third viewing is more powerfully moving than the first.
1967;The personal impact of Brokeback Mountain on me was that it made me treasure love more.
1968;in a year of some great contenders, Brokeback Mountain still stands out to me as the best film of 2005 .
1969;For what it's worth, it won more Best Picture awards in 2005 than any film in cinema history, and was the best.
1970;Brokeback Mountain is one of the best bitter sweet love stories I've seen in a long time!
1971;Jake and Heath performances are superb!!
1972;The cinematography is excellent, beautiful!
1973;Whether you're gay or straight this story will have a profound effect on many many people.
1974;I believe a lot of people can relate to having a love so strong with another individual but due to certain times, situations, demographics, jobs or other possibly uncontrollable circumstances this love had to stay hidden.
1975;Jake Gyllenhaal gave an outstanding and very emotional performance in this movie!
1976;This is the best movie I have seen in years.
1977;Powerful, sensitive, heartwrenching and just really makes you think about life and love.
1978;If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would!
1979;This is probably one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.
1980;It stays with you long after it ends.
1981;It makes you look at the choices you make in your life.
1982;i really loved this movie!!
1983;The acting is great and all that, but, sorry, I'm all about happy endings and not misery and life lessons!
1984;I concur that this is a gem of a movie.
1985;Also, its a tragic love tale that happens to be about gay men.
1986;This is the stuff that great filmmaking accomplishes.
1987;Brokeback Mountain is, perhaps, the most powerful movie of the year, which takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller.
1988;It is simply a love story.
1989;Brokeback Mountain is, perhaps, the most powerful movie of the year, which takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller.
1990;It is simply a love story.
1991;Few movies rise yo the 'engagement level' of the best live theatre.
1992;This is the greatest gay movie that has ever been made in my opinion.
1993;It is heartwarming, romantic, and sad towards the end when Jack got killed by those awful straight dudes he got messed up with.
1994;Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.
1995;After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can.
1996;ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery.
1997;Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable.
1998;This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience.
1999;when I opened the box, I found that the digital copy is accessed via the Universal website.
2000;Ang Lee has done it again.
2001;This beautiful movie is so well crafted that the sex of the two lovers is irrelevant,their need for each other is ever.
2002;Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall are absolute perfection as the two men who commit to each other in their own fashion and live the rest of their days recapturing the magic moment on Brokeback Mountain.
2003;The wives of the characters, particularly Michelle Williams are outstanding as providing a reality check/counterfoil to Ennis and Jack.
2004;a totally enjoyable, rewarding cinematic experience.
2005;i was amazed by this great story.
2006;this movie is A+ and should have won the Best Picutre Award, instead of CRASH.
2007;This is my favorite movie.
2008;The acting by both leads as well as the supporting actresses was perfect.
2009;Being taken for granted is easy, but loved like that is just amazing.
2010;Everything rang true and it was just so moving.
2011;Also, the collector's edition with the postcards are fantastic.
2012;I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
2013;to all , this movie is a must see for anyone who has had a family member or a friend that is gay.
2014;If you peel away the controversy, look past the fact that this film should have won the Best Picture Oscar, and forget the late.
2015;The performances range from excellent (Jake Gyllenhaal and .
2016;especially Michelle Williams) to the amazing, career.
2017;defining performance of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.
2018;boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled.
2019;up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love.
2020;The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film.
2021;I thought I had seen great films in the past, but this film stands alone in its greatness.
2022;It pulls you in, and you think back on it for days after you see it.
2023;Ang Lee and the superb actors who brought this story to life will surely be remembered as pioneers and exceptional artists for many decades to come.
2024;I hope you win every Oscar nomination.
2025;And much of the commentary seems to amount to so much posturing.
2026;From what I've been reading, the most sophisticated response (arguably) is something along the lines of It's pretty good.
2027;But it's really just a love story.
2028;I will give them credit though: they certainly have come up with better age make.
2029;The reason a viewer might want more from the story is because what IS there is handled so well.
2030;But the movie gives the lie to the myth of the strong silent type.
2031;and in this particular neck of the woods, that kind of sharing probably has (for good and for ill) yet to make much of a foothold.
2032;Her performance has been described as heartbreaking, and it is.
2033;But it is precisely her character's verbal inarticulateness in the face of an overwhelming realization that lends meaning to her every expression and gesture.
2034;In one of that film's episodes, she played a proudly defiant young lesbian student in the 1970s.
2035;And of the significance of geography and social class as factors that may allow gays and lesbians options in how to lead their lives.
2036;but of course, there are strong social and political forces even today who would have it otherwise.
2037;They might say, See, these men are fully capable of having a relationship with the opposite sex, of siring children, and establishing a family.
2038;And that leads to their downfall.
2039;Good art like BROKEBACK is less about getting across a moral or socio.
2040;political message than it is about portraying life as it is lived.
2041;which is about all you can demand from a work of art.
2042;Highly recommended to those with an open mind, and can somehow relate to two men being in love.
2043;The movie is tragic, yet rewarding.
2044;One can relate to the living a lie scenario as it is so common today.
2045;Even those who opose the gay life style need to give credit to an outstanding director, excellent cast, and most of all the beautiful scenery, which is a pleasant change from the congested, and urban setting.
2046;I would encourage people to see it, as it is a reminder to appreciate what, and who you have, because you never know when it, or who you have may be taken away from you.
2047;I would have much rather have seen a happy ending, but life isn't always about happy endings.
2048;It's just life, and this movie will tear at your heart.
2049;I enjoyed the mountain scenes with the sheep, but they only occupied about 1% of the movie.
2050;Interesting that so many people rate it highly on Amazon, everone I have actually met thought the same as I did.
2051;, and they're having sex, and all the people of the world are watching, and they got Oscar nominated!
2052;the only reasons I give it two stars are Santaolalla's great music and Prieto's amazing cinematography.
2053;The adaptation by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the short story.
2054;much of the dialogue is lifted from the book verbatim.
2055;The film highlights the books' contradictions: epic, yet intimate
2056;Yet, it is an irony that Asian born Ang Lee has directed a definitive American masterpiece.
2057;Unless one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.
2058;Lies, obfuscation, and concealment poison the soul.
2059;every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is outstanding: cinematography, editing, makeup (the characters convincingly age twenty years without overdoing it), music (just enough to highlight the story).
2060;heath Ledger's performance is masterful.
2061;But he merits recognition as well.
2062;These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources.
2063;Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles.
2064;regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time.
2065;Movie was very true to the story.
2066;This story was very moving, and I recommend seeing it for all who have been hesitant.
2067;In fact, as you watch the movie, this issue will take a back seat to the real story about two lonely people who weren't experienced in love relationships, and together found the closeness they were missing in their lives.
2068;This is a truly touching and moving presentation.
2069;It also perfectly captures the 60's when this sort of romance would have unfolded exactly as presented on the screen.
2070;Its brilliant portrayals and casting create an exquisitely overwhelming romantic fantasy!
2071;It is the story of two PEOPLE in love.
2072;I saw this movie because I love movies in general and will see anything that seems interesting to me.
2073;this is a beautifully shot movie with breath.
2074;taking scenery that perfectly depicts the lonely and sometimes harsh beauty of Wyoming.
2075;The acting is good by everyone, but I agree with a previous reviewer that what was missing between the two main characters, Ennis and Jack, was the true intimacy of two people falling in love.
2076;It made me wonder how many of us live that way .
2077;good movie, so if that's what you're in the mood for, you should see something else.
2078;This is such a beautiful character study of two men, living in a part of the country, and a time, in which their immense and passionate love for one another was simply not understood.
2079;Incredibly acted, poignantly told, everyone should see this film.
2080;The package is nice, and the cards (one a replica of the one Jack sent to Ennis!)
2081;goers actually changed their minds about homosexuality after seeing the film, and that the film transgressed this theme.
2082;The men take the attention here, but Michelle Williams performance was the real outstanding showcase here.
2083;Ledgers vast and diverse characters are commendable and this is a prime example.
2084;the film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long.
2085;Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife.
2086;deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it.
2087;the soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of He Was A Friend of Mine.
2088;As someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all.
2089;broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult.
2090;For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs.
2091;Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.
2092;now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie?
2093;Stop and take the gender issue away for a moment.
2094;The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, gay or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love.
2095;Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful?
2096;Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world?
2097;Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills?
2098;a. lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard?
2099;The film deals with a very special relationship widely commented around the world between two men.
2100;this delicate issue is handled with special care, without hurting sensibilities, the script nevertheless is built on non solid basis, making just emphasis on the surface of the things.
2101;There is an excessive employment of arresting visual landscapes and some well made violent dialogues.
2102;special acknowledgement to the arresting photography, artistic direction and splendid performances of the two main protagonists.
2103;A riveting film with great performances.
2104;I especially underrated performance is Michele.
2105;She has a range of emotions that makes her a great actress.
2106;I keep thinking about lots movie scenes after I watched it, it's so touching.
2107;I keep thinking about the scence after I watched it, it's so touching.
2108;is willing to find his way onto the right path, if he can just convince his lover, Ennis Del Mar, to join him.
2109;Ennis, perhaps more appalled than Jack at what he finds himself to be .
2110;it's a fine movie, beautifully crafted.
2111;I have a dog who manages to express herself reasonably well with looks and body language.
2112;He's awfully good at gazes, glowers, and stares.
2113;are quite as spontaneous as here portrayed.
2114;no matter how masterfully delivered.
2115;larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana, Ang Lee, the incredibly talented cast of actors .
2116;all brought this short story to life in a brilliant way.
2117;length feature film, it was also the breathtaking cinematography: I could almost feel the cool wind against my face, smell the rich dampness of the earth, taste the biting cold of the rushing river.
2118;The acting, the directing, the cinematography .
2119;all of these things, together with a beautiful original score by Gustavo Santoalalla, produced .
2120;one of the greatest films ever made.
2121;Perhaps we push our emotions so far down that nothing can ever penetrate the surface, nothing can really touch us until a movie, or a story, or a simple sunrise suddenly sparks a memory, a feeling.
2122;This movie (and the story) embodies so much more than that.
2123;As Ennis so poignantly put it: If you can't fix it you've got to stand it.
2124;I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the capacity to understand the human condition.
2125;Ang Lee once again proves what an incredible director can make out what was originally simply a short story,with panoramic and sweeping views of the mountains in Wyoming, and the tenderly unfolding love story of the two young cowboys.
2126;I was expecting something else, too, but found an elusive, though present, plot presented in a minimalistic style.
2127;this movie really hits home with gay people.
2128;The sucess of this movie is based onan international renown director and a good original story, andmost important, the promotion strategy of the company released it.
2129;Still when I finished watching the movie the day after, I thought: Oscar.
2130;movie, because it is an adult and mature story.
2131;A movie for mature and grown.
2132;the two cowboys got aware of the intensity of love after, in the course of their lives, little by little(!)
2133;, but the love and passion had been there .
2134;an absolutely passionate connection indeed .
2135;By the way, there are two iceberg melting scenes: their meeting and hugging after years apart and when one is punching the other almost in despair (where am I going without you?)
2136;Great actors (both, and Heath Ledger is ready: superb), great actresses (both wives
2137;who said life is easy?Eight fair nomminations indeed.
2138;Yep, the best film so far this century.
2139;The best on every level
2140;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal truly brought the two main characters to life, and Michelle Williams performance was heartbreaking.
2141;Ang Lee's direction was perfect.
2142;The best film of the year no matter what the Academy says.
2143;In utter expectation that I would be transported into some new [.]
2144;reality, a transcendent one of love and sacrifice and transfiguration.
2145;and this so is so great as to have made me ask, as I watched in the theater, and so what?
2146;This is a very good movie and it is not definitively a gay cowboy movie.
2147;In some sense it is based in a kind of story that exists since ancient times: stories of men alone can be found in the Gospels, other biblical stories, and in Arthurian and Knights romances (where tragic or unfulfilled love is so common) so Ang Lee's depiction of a conventional theme is not so rare, in some sense America should feel proud that this Taiwanese humble man directed this beautiful story set in an All.
2148;Two scenes in closed atmospheres were superb: at a family house which I don't tell and in a trailer.
2149;He should had won the Oscar in the Best Actor Category for his portrayal of this quiet and disturbed childhood cowboy, amazing!
2150;There is one (count it, one) scene, shot in semi.
2151;the acting in the film is, well, I forgot that I was watching actors!
2152;Heath Ledger's Ennis is so believable, I didn't know he is Australian!
2153;lipped and stoic, are believable, subtle performances.
2154;visually, the film is a study in contrasts.
2155;Rodrigo Prieto's unglossy cinematography, very sharp, has its own stark beauty, and Gustavo Santaolalla's decidedly spare score, add to the simple and sensitive way this story is told.
2156;I was drawn into the story by the simple and beautiful imagery, the remarkably believable performances, the all.
2157;believable situations, and yes, I wept.
2158;And that's good enough reason for me to write about it.
2159;Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful, faithful, and moving film.
2160;The film conveys intact and true the overall mood and emotionally terse feeling of Proulx's literary work, even though not every scene nor all of the dialogue from the short story has been translated into the film verbatim (although a great majority of the dialogue and description has).
2161;as one viewer's impressions, given that director Ang Lee is Chinese (Taiwan), he imbues throughout the entire film an Asian or Chinese aesthetic.
2162;Even though unsaid or said indirectly, an observant viewer will understand completely the emotions and feelings that are being communicated.
2163;but also in Chinese culture has connotations of wholeness and completeness.
2164;The dots in each serves as a reminder that there are always traces of one in the other.
2165;Also, the dots serve as a reminder that absolute extreme on one part transforms instantly into the opposite, or that the labels yin and yang are conditioned by an observer's point of view.
2166;For example, the hardest stone can be easiest to break.
2167;deserved praise this film has already received.
2168;Let me just say that Brokeback Mountain is the best film I've ever seen, and I don't expect to ever see one that will surpass it in my estimation, admiration or esteem.
2169;This movie was a transcendent experience for me, and I will never be the same.
2170;It should have won the Oscar, Heath Ledger should have won the Oscar, Jake Gyllenhaal should have won the Oscar, Michelle Williams should have won the Oscar.
2171;i did see this movie and feel that a review is warranted.
2172;This is not a brave movie.
2173;Wanna see a brave movie in Hollywood?
2174;Show me a movie about a nice, faithful man who is a good father and husband where religion is a large part of his life.
2175;i can name a lot of movies with gay themes.
2176;It had a production budget of $14 million and a cast of at least 5 relatively well.
2177;The way this movie was played up, you'd have thought it was the reincarnation of the Godfather Part II.
2178;Yeah, cinema verite and all that.
2179;okay, all that having been said: this was a very, very good movie.
2180;I found it to be very well.
2181;well acted, very well written.
2182;It is, in a nutshell, a great work of art.
2183;It was great in its own way, accomplished everything it could have and did a great job.
2184;(Also a look into another world and a story of forbidden love, I might add.)
2185;In fact, the one thing that set the production apart from a true indie movie is that the acting was so good.
2186;Like the opening words to Anna Karenina: happy families are all the same.
2187;the fears that Leger had are real today, and were especially so in the past.
2188;anyway, this was a very, very good movie and I enjoyed watching it.
2189;a note about the soundtrack: good lord, talk about over.
2190;if this is a great soundtrack, then bear in the big blue house is the next best thing to Mozart.
2191;Two ranch hands, Ennis Del Mar (a very sexy and rugged Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (a remarkably vulnerable Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work when they get a gig as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain.
2192;They continue their summer working hard during the day and making love at night until one day Summer comes to an end and they go their separate ways.
2193;They are still in love and their yearning for each other is undeniable.
2194;the story of their love and how it unfolds is the story of the film, which is an absolute triumph for everyone involved in making it.
2195;i am very pleased, to say the least, to see two rugged, naturally masculine men romantically connected to each other in a major motion picture.
2196;Ennis and Jack's love story transcends gender and anatomy.
2197;It truly is a remarkable (and daring) achievement in American cinema!Ang Lee (Couching Tiger, Hidden Drago, director) did an outstanding job conveying the subtle yearning these two men had for each other.
2198;Of course, he had two very capable actors to deliver his vision, but yet it was his vision that really made this film a masterpiece.
2199;A marvelous talent (and sexy looks to boot!)
2200;Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion, is a must.
2201;It's an R. rated film, so no kids allowed!
2202;definitely one of the Best Films of 2005!
2203;Was it worth the wait?
2204;The film, an adaptation of a story by Annie Proulx, is a thing of beauty.
2205;Exceptionally faithful to the source material, Ang Lee, director or of the gay comedy The Wedding Banquet (among many other notable films), has fashioned a classic love story .
2206;one I feel sure will endure.
2207;Because rather than being groundbreaking, I found the story to be a simple variation on the classic formula which has fate conspiring against a pair of lovers.
2208;is it really groundbreaking in 2006 for a film to depict the passionate love between two men?
2209;staright actors Peter Finch and Murray Head played a passionate love scene in Sunday, Bloody Sunday.
2210;In 1985 Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and William Hurt won Best Actor as the film's openly gay protagonist.
2211;In 1987 we saw the landmark Merchant/Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster's Maurice, a love story that featured not only a happy ending, but James Wilby and Rupert Graves in a simulated sex scene which included full frontal nudity.
2212;Other gay inclusive Best Picture Oscar nominees have included: Midnight Cowboy (which won the award in 1969), Cabaret, Dog Day Afternoon, The Crying Game, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Full Monty and The Hours.
2213;There's an old show business adage that says any publicity is good publicity.
2214;Though I can't figure out why Brokeback Mountain should be considered either controversial or groundbreaking, I highly recommend it, and would love to see it win this year's Oscar for Best Picture.
2215;Jack, on the other hand, is extroverted, vital, enthusiastic, idealistic and a dreamer.
2216;He may seem the weaker of both, but he's actually stronger than Ennis, because he knows what he wants and is willing to fight for it.
2217;That's how I see it.
2218;This is a wonderful masterpiece which no recent movie can compare with.
2219;Definitely the best movie of 2005.
2220;This is a landmark film that will be remembered for generations.
2221;debate around this movie swirls around the fact that it carries the sinister liberal agenda to finally demarginalize the gay lifestyle and bring it to the mainstream.
2222;And it provides no uplifting answer.
2223;Even in the face of the Academy's snub, Brokeback Mountain still tells its powerful story.
2224;I remember when a Christian activist called my office, and practically yelled at the top of his lungs over the phone because I commented a movie that promote a Gay lifestyle as the best movie in the 21st century.
2225;Brokeback Mountain belongs to that unique 1% of the movies where a short story from one of the best authors the world ever witnessed is combined with the spirit of the director, and acted out by actors and actresses who, despite being pop performers and show off their athletic abilities and appearance on screen, is able to put aside all that distraction, and carry out the dram flawlessly.
2226;I suspect that the Oscar board probably received the phone call I received from various Christian groups.
2227;But whatever controversy surrounds this movie, its very existence marked the beginning of a new journey for humanity.
2228;thank you, Ms. Anne Proulx, Mr. Ang Lee, and the actors and actresses of Brokeback Mountain, for creating this masterpiece.
2229;This is my new all.
2230;The acting is great, the scenery is great and it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.
2231;the soundtrack is a vital part of the success of this masterpiece.
2232;I gave it rating that I did because the movie was well done and the actors did a great job.
2233;I love Horse movies and I wish that there were more like that.
2234;Loved her gift and watched the night I gave it to her.
2235;In this movie, both main actors portray characters which come across as completely believable.
2236;a must see movie this year!!!
2237;Definitely an Academy Award contender!
2238;In this movie, both main actors portray characters which come across as completely believable.
2239;a must see movie this year!!!
2240;You will be happy that you did.
2241;It didnt just move me.
2242;And all the response it received from men and women all over the world reiterating this fact.
2243;thank you all for reading.
2244;I enjoyed this film from start to finish.
2245;The story is a drama so there is no action or nothing but that's good.
2246;It's a haunting love story that will get you hooked and will not let you go.
2247;The acting is excellent and every actor gives oscar worthy performances the acting is the best I ahve seen in a long time.
2248;The score is great for the filma nd the scienry is great especially for some on who ahs seen where they film (in jasper/banff albert).
2249;Overall I would dnot say it's the best film of 2005 but it's up there as being one of the best films of the year.
2250;BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a great movie.
2251;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall give great performances throughout the movie.
2252;The scenery in this movie is beautiful (filmed right here in Alberta).
2253;The movie is an emotional journey of two men who work together one summer herding sheep, and ultimately fall in love.
2254;Michelle Williams is great, playing Ennis' (Ledger) wife.
2255;This is a great movie.
2256;I was really touched and moved by it.
2257;but I will say that the story of these 2 men is heart wrenching and worth it .
2258;It is a memorable, life.
2259;long, and very sad love story of two people who just happen to both be boys and then men.
2260;In every move he makes on screen, he gets the personal cost to Ennis of living with what cannot be .
2261;In many ways, this is a great film, and Heath Ledger's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, as well as an Oscar.
2262;nevertheless, it is still a beautiful and heart.
2263;It has beautiful scenery and a score that is appropriate in its simplicity and repetitiveness, and the performance by Heath Ledger shows him as an actor of great sensitivity, promise, and skill.
2264;Brokeback Mountain has received a considerable amount of attention from the media for it's incredible story and visual detail, as well as its controversial story line.
2265;Brokeback challenges the very nature of a western romantic film, and although it is not a typical love story it will be upheld as a landmark film for both the GLBT community as well as American cinema.
2266;The movie explores the societal pressures of marriage and heterosexuality as both men marry women and have children.
2267;The character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) is murdered at the end of the film.
2268;Secondly, you feel incredibly sorry for the wives and the children as they become aware of their father's infidelity that end up destroying their families.
2269;Heath Ledger's recent death adds an extra sting at the end of the film.
2270;if the content of two men falling in love is of no interest to you, the incredibly beautiful scenery and soundtrack are worth it alone.
2271;Approach this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed.
2272;Leave the prejudices at the door, sit back, and enjoy the show!
2273;This movie is a breakthrough from all the corruptions corporations have done to the movie industry.
2274;brokeback Mountain is an extraordinary love story, in an oppressive time.
2275;nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is a breakthrough for humanity, and I pay my salute to the actors and makers of this movie, for making this movie possible.
2276;As two weeks go by, they share their life about each other and how they came to this point in their life.
2277;A friendship develops and becomes somewhat deeper.
2278;When they meet up, it's an emotional one.
2279;for Ennis, he has been alone most of his life.
2280;He keeps himself inside, however Jack was able to open him and Ennis not happy with his married life, really missed Jack.
2281;can this special friendship continue dispite the changes in their personal lives?
2282;the Cinematography is beautiful and well done.
2283;He was always with his daughter).
2284;brokeback Mountain (2005) won the Academy Award for Best Director.
2285;ang Lee, Best Screenplay (Adapted), Original Score.
2286;also nominated for Best Actor.
2287;heath Ledger, Best Supporting Actor.
2288;jake Gyllenhaal, Best Supporting Actress.
2289;why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?A very diffucult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.
2290;Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell will continue his changing character in the film.
2291;The scenes with Heath Ledger will stay in the film.
2292;A beautiful love story told in a beautiful way.
2293;I was absolutely satisfied with purchasing the item.
2294;The story, mirrored by the magnificent setting, was both wonderful and chilling because of it's undeniable truth.
2295;brokeback Mountain is a rare, unsettling, jewel of a movie.
2296;I believe Heath Ledger did a magnificent job, but I think Jake Gyllenhal (sp?)
2297;Anyone who has ever deeply loved, whether it be a lover or a child, and been separated from that deep love for any period of time knows what kind of true heart pain you feel.
2298;it's the fact that their love is so present on the screen that you feel it piercing your heart.
2299;married with children, etc.), except that it is so much about deep love and it is rare to see anything these days except for those flighty little chick flicks that are cute but meaningless.
2300;I was just completely overcome, even though I had read the book first and knew what it was and what was coming.
2301;Just go with an open mind and an open heart and let it reach you.
2302;A word will live in the hearts and minds of the American and International community that watched this years Academy Awards.
2303;Our community, and others, was hoping to hear something else read when the award for Best Picture was made.
2304;well in our community and a select set of heterosexuals.
2305;identified heterosexuals who have called the movie wonderful, uplifting and a new and fresh look into the struggles and life of closeted gay men.
2306;They see the way Jack and Ennis marry and have kids, yet still hook.
2307;so was America ready for this film to win Best picture.
2308;Nevertheless, one good thing that will become of this is that more Americans will go to see the film.
2309;Truth be told, audiences enjoy it.
2310;This is the unexpected story of lonely people in search of a special dream.
2311;Years ago, Europeans ventured into this forbidden niche and established a precedent which up until now, American film companies have been reluctant to address.
2312;With the incredible talents of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist the US has not only responded and shattered conventional wisdom, but offers perhaps the finest film of it's genre.
2313;Brokeback mountain is a story of two men searching for companionship and love.
2314;Emotionally charged and deeply touching in every respect, the film presents audiences with a portrait of fading Americana, amid changing seasons.
2315;All in all, a courageous attempt to mirror the life and loves of a reclusive aspect of the American cowboy.
2316;After seeing it for a second time, I picked up a lot of details and ended up loving the movie.
2317;People complain about the love scene, and I did at first, but they were just trying to make it realistic.
2318;the movie, as I'm sure many have heard numerous times, is a wonderful version of the Annie Proulx short story and really does capture the essence of it and in some parts, extends the story a little bit more.
2319;the story of Jack and Ennis (and we cannot forget their unfortunate wives) is one that I can imagine rings true in a lot of closeted gay men.
2320;beautfully made with sweeping cinematography (Ang Lee style) of Wyoming country, this movie is touching, heartbreaking and delicately made.
2321;Through the amazing performances by all the actors, especially Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the sensitivity of the subjects is subtley dealt with.
2322;all in all, highly recommended and should be viewed in full without any pre.
2323;This movie has to have one of the best love story ever.
2324;It wasn't to much talking but you seen the love growing between the two charaters.
2325;Brokeback Mountain is a story of real people, in a real place, and at a real time.
2326;something I grew up knowing about.
2327;the acting is outstanding, especially the portrayal of Ennis by Heath Ledger.
2328;His character was so authentic it was uncanny.
2329;He also mastered a form of speech that I remember.
2330;He spoke without moving his lips.
2331;His emotion was so real when he learned of Jack's death.
2332;I think the strength of this movie is in the universal human emotions that are so brilliantly captured.
2333;One of the most moving and grace.
2334;filled works I've ever experienced in all the arts, this film is an astonishing masterpiece of beauty, truth and heartbreak.
2335;About love found, love lost, love endured, about how men.
2336;In selfless performances of extraordinary depth, Heath Ledger's Ennis solidly anchors the film, while Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack illuminates it, with immense feeling and sensitivity.
2337;These men found a real home in each other, and their tenderness and mutual feeling, both expressed and unexpressed, is heart.
2338;for even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.
2339;he kneads you until you are pliant
2340;all these things shall love do unto youthat you may know the secrets of your heart,and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.
2341;love gives naught but itselfand takes naught but from itself.
2342;love possesses not nor would it be possessed
2343;when you love you should not say,God is in my heart, but ratherI am in the heart of God.
2344;And think not that you can direct the course of love,for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
2345;this movie is so well made by todays standards.
2346;Its sovisual and beautiful, the directing, acting, music, cinematography, pace, all flow together to create magic.
2347;ang lee did a fantastic job with each actor, they gave their best, heathledger, Jake gyllenhaal, michelle williams and ann hathaway.
2348;I can't remember when a moviehas sparked so much debate and that is the best thingthat could have come from this.
2349;As far as the romance is concerned, if you like drunken sodomy(that's how all homosexual relationships start right), you'll love this movie.
2350;This movie is pure hype designed for me and you to sit and talk about how either good or bad it is so that around Oscar time it'll win it's awards.
2351;If you truely want to watch a film about a love story that's truely award worthy watch Walk The Line.
2352;I was totally shocked with the two men together in a sexual scene!
2353;It's artfully directed and beautifully acted.
2354;The whole movie spent a lot of time laying foundation for the final moment of maximum emotional impact.
2355;, moved me to tears.
2356;This movie is tastefully done.
2357;I've seen thousands of movies, but this incredibly made movie from a simple story of love transcends all boundaries.
2358;This movie is dedicated to all of us who have loved someone in our lives who we couldn't have or show how we truly felt.
2359;The only tragedy is that it was snubbed by the Oscars for a much lesser film, even though it had won best picture from all of the dozens of other award shows and film critics.
2360;This is a historic movie.
2361;What you take away from it depends largely on your personal views.
2362;Jack pushes for a more substantial relationship but Ennis' surplus repression prevents him from imagining a good life living with the person he loves, another man.
2363;While there is alot of serious subject matter at hand, director Ang Lee does a great job mixing up tension you will feel with great and sometimes subtle moments of comedy.
2364;The great story and scenery are backed up by top notch acting from all corners.
2365;The cinematography is a joy to watch even though you're looking at Canada mostly and not Wyoming is still is a gorgeous film.
2366;In a sense this movie mirrors a great love story like Romeo and Juliet.
2367;But characters like Ennis and Jack and their situations are very realistic, even in today's so called liberal society.
2368;but I have read numerous feedback about Brokeback Mountain, so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the movie is so good, I had to pick up a copy of the story book in which Brokeback Mountain is found.
2369;mind you, though, that content is what many movie viewers don't know about.
2370;wrenching story and writing, gorgeous cinematography, a soundtrack that I listen to often, and also soooo important to remember what gay men have had to deal with in our lifetimes, and still have to deal with, no matter how far we've come in more liberal states.
2371;Imagine the depths of heart that could be explored by this unexpected relationship, and the frank exchanges about the lies that gay men had/have to live to survive in society.
2372;Michelle Williams was wonderful as loyal, betrayed Ennis's wife Alma.
2373;Given the incredible press and attention this movie generated, I expected much more.
2374;a pure chief of work!!!
2375;You will get to learn/know more about the film and the challenges they encountered to bring this excellent film into reality.
2376;I found it incredibly moving and haunting.
2377;I have seen a lot of Gay Drama films
2378;Brokeback takes that idea and turns it on its head.
2379;This potentially, and problematically, renders a man in the developing world silent.
2380;The right mood never seemed to hit me: what to watch.
2381;it's a good movie, a little slow in parts, but with some deeply moving scenes.
2382;There was at most a little of the top of Gyllenhaal's buttocks.
2383;I found that believable because I've known couples to ignore even the biggest pink (or white, they could be white) elephants to avoid the bigger trauma of breaking up.
2384;Alma sees, and Williams' shock/disbelief in those moments earned her the Oscar nom right there.
2385;tragedy hyperbole to say that Ledger's is the best of an excellent group of performances.
2386;caliber epic when I'm not sure that's the case.
2387;now to review Capote, Good Night and Good Luck, and Munich so I can get slammed three more times.
2388;A very well acted movie.
2389;Moving and in many ways disturbing.
2390;But this film was never marketed as one with a powerful messege, it is a film about romance, and that is the reason I saw, and enjoyed this harmouniously paced film.
2391;I sat in dark and grinned wonderfully at the vista frames and of the mild, poetic nature of it all.
2392;I fell in love with the films eager willingness to expose tenderness and then crippling the audience with its poignant, and dramatic ending.
2393;It spells originality, and that's what the Oscars, and demanding audiances search for.
2394;I am a big Jake Gyllenhaal fan, and, in my opinion, his performance in this film out.
2395;classed all his other movies!
2396;This movie is the combination of romance and spirituality, both are qualities of all human beings, not just for women.
2397;There are both men and women in this group, and we voted, unanimously, that this should be the best picture winner.
2398;Just like a reviewer before me said, the feeling you get from this movie stays with you forever.
2399;The love that developed from this time spread like wildfire, and viewers are left with the remorse for Jack's unfortunate death.
2400;This feeling SHOULD stay with you forever, and Ang Lee did a very good job creating this feeling.
2401;In a private club that I participated in, many of my friends praise how creative the concept of Brokeback Mountain is, using an idea that will definitely trigger a response, and masterfully play with scenery and emotion to tune this response to one of adoration.
2402;This movie is created from pure emotion, crystalized into a masterpiece that everyone can watch, understand, and feel.
2403;Director Ang Lee is a true magician, and after watching the Hulk, also directed by him, it is clear that his skills in directing are improving.
2404;This movie will be remembered for years and years to come due to its superb acting, majestic cinematography, incredible dialog, intense emotion, cogent storyline, and the excellent score converged into making this two.
2405;plus movie one of the great landmarks in the history of the cinema.
2406;vulnerable performance is so believable that very little make.
2407;As you watch him, you really do believe that this taciturn young roughneck is actually becoming a middle.
2408;aged man who is coming to terms with day to day responsibilities, family life, and an ever.
2409;Can't say what has already been said regarding Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Anne Hathaway because we all know they gave excellent performances.
2410;ang Lee has done another amazing job putting this film together that was well deserved.
2411;this film will always be remembered by anyone who viewed it.
2412;It has already become a classic unto itself and will be critically reviewed over and over again in years to come.
2413;I am heartened that BAFTA awarded Jake best supporting actor in London.
2414;It is my hope that the real sound track will be released in the near future.
2415;There's nothing outstanding in this film.
2416;Nothing that makes it better than all the other movies that explore the concept of forbidden love.
2417;This film's praise is propelled by the fact that the characters are gay.
2418;i think King Kong did a better job of conveying the elements of forbidden love.
2419;Simply put, this is the best movie I've seen in a while.
2420;Ang Lee did a great job, and the actors were supurb!
2421;Brokeback is more than a love story, and it's more than a gay love story.
2422;This movie is something more powerful than words can really describe.
2423;The beauty of it is its subtlety.
2424;This movie really changed me in some way and I appreciate the risks that the actors and everyone involved took to tell this story and they did a beautiful job.
2425;This movie broke my heart because of the love between these two guys.
2426;This movie stays with you.
2427;man cowboys that find love in each other.
2428;The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo.
2429;what makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love.
2430;But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.
2431;the cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning.
2432;The soundtrack is also amazing.
2433;I am certain that this picture is very Oscar.
2434;It is a very full.
2435;The one thing I can tell you is that gay or straight you got to see this movie.
2436;This movie happens to be about two guys who are gay, but there are important and powerful messages in the movie that apply to everyone, regardless of sexual preference.
2437;The scenery is breathtaking, and the acting, while at times a little contrived, is really well done.
2438;And if the answer is no, then you should be brave enough to do whatever it takes to be true to yourself.
2439;The heartbreak, the sincerity, lonileness, greatest love of all, next to that of man for God, that of man for man.
2440;Sex is just a passing expression of the great depth of devotion and need.
2441;i hate that this movie, a really love story, was so attacked and make fun of, can we grow up and see this as a variation of a love story?
2442;she should have been more compassionate and encouraged Ledger to be true to himself.
2443;She had already established a new life for herself.
2444;It really gives a point of view that I do not think has been captured by the big screen before.
2445;After viewing this movie, I came away thinking wow!
2446;Ang Lee (director of The Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon among others) really brought his A game with his beautiful visuals and his ability to film this visceral film.
2447;The movie is about two individuals who take on a job in a secluded outdoor area and develop a special bond after an intimate, unplanned event occurred.
2448;The film also details two completely opposite personas with regards to their beliefs of what their relationship is, where it is going and how their inner conflict compounds their daily living and relationships with others.
2449;It is too bad for Heath Ledger that the male lead category for the Oscars was so loaded with great performances, but I think he had just as good of a performance as winner Hoffman.
2450;Gyllenhall's performance was good, however, he has not proven to be as dynamic of an actor as Ledger or others.
2451;Ledger's versatility was proven again during this movie and we can continue to expect great things from this actor in future endeavors.
2452;I have seen all Oscar best picture nominated films and thought winner Crash was good, but not best picture good, then I saw Capote and thought for sure that that was the movie that should have won it.
2453;and watch the film for what it is, a story of inner conflict, then this is a movie to see.
2454;You have to keep your mind wide open to watch this movie
2455;Keep in your mind and hearts the human sensibilities and emotions portraited by the actors.
2456;I found myself teary eyed at the end of the movie.
2457;The story is multidimensional and I learn something new with every viewing.
2458;By the way, David Hasslehoff's song, Hot Shot City, is particulary good.
2459;Through marriage, through children, and through the mighty grip of societal confines and the expectations of what it is to be a man.
2460;The movie can't, you must keep an open mind, you have to decide for yourself if you enjoy this or not.
2461;It's as if the movie insinuated itself around my very soul and wrapped its grief around my unsuspecting heart .
2462;The beauty of this movie is that it makes the characters seem so real, so live and their pain so raw, that the sorrow that permeates the story .
2463;hinted at first in the display of the most beautiful desolated sceneries, together with a melancholic music score, sneaks in your head, and unknowingly but quite forcefully takes hold of your body and soul and never seems to let them go.
2464;This time I left feeling better because it became clear to me that what I had just witnessed was one of the most beautiful love stories ever told.
2465;Because there is something so refreshing, so innocent, so lovely about how the story unfolds, that it literally turned this quite jaded, a bit cynical New Yorker, inside out.
2466;both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are phenomenal.
2467;What a remarkable screen performance these two give .
2468;a performance dug directly from the heart.
2469;And both Heath L. and Jake G. deliver throughout the movie.
2470;this was a wonderful work from Ang Lee.
2471;To portray this movie in such a delicate, sensitive way merits all ovations it gets.
2472;That choice has really paid off here because in a way that's why the movie works: because to find love when one is so young, so innocent, that is the purest kind of love.
2473;Thank you for showing me the reason why.
2474;This is the most haunting love story I've seen in a movie.
2475;What a powerful lesson this film teaches.
2476;treat others like you would like to be treated.
2477;It is most commonly rendered as do unto others as you would have them do unto you, or in other words treat others as you want to be treated.
2478;in most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.
2479;congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.
2480;This is a piece of work that is so powerful in all respects that it simply won't go out of your mind, and no matter what happens at the Academy awards, it will stay with you longer than any of the others.
2481;Leigh won for a very fine performance, but Hepburn's movie and her performance have been shown many times more than Streetcar .
2482;Everything in the script fits tightly with everything else .
2483;more evidence, if we need it, of Larry McMurty and his collaborator's sublime achievement in glueing themselves to Annie Proulx' original remarkable creation.
2484;This is among the very greatest I have seen.
2485;I won't go on and on about how beautiful the scenery is, how great the acting is, how wonderful the direction is, and how touching the story is.
2486;I know plenty of movies that received a huge amount of critical acclaim that sound very similar: The Bridges of Madison County, Titanic, and Love Story are good examples.
2487;family, violence, and finding strength and confidence in one's self.3) There are other factors that make this movie great besides the controversial content.
2488;the musical score is beautiful, the acting is right on target (Heath Ledger in particular succeeds in exuding multiple emotions while barely speaking), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the screenplay is a model of how to adapt a short story into a movie.
2489;it keeps all the scenes and dialogue while expanding the areas that help move the plot forward (the women in particular get larger roles in the movie).
2490;It deserved all the acolades it received.
2491;(1) If you are looking for an edge of your seat thriller and a new Love Story.
2492;Ang Lee and the writers did a wonderful job taking what was a (very small) article written in the New York times and expand it into a great film.
2493;(2) I was very impressed by the cinematography.
2494;(4) The soundtrack is a great .
2495;please don't listen to it when you are in a down mood.
2496;Nonetheless, it's imaginative, creative and worth listening to.
2497;For some reason I have an aversion to the letter box format.
2498;This is a movie that will survive time and is destined to become a classic.
2499;It tells the tale of love, heartbreak, and complex family (& societal) relationships.
2500;The acting is superb, especially an easily emotionally.
2501;connective Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams (as the strong wife, Alma).
2502;The movie is beautifully shot and very enjoyable for the scenery as well as the story and acting.
2503;When society catches up with this movie on its sexuality level, it will still be relevant because it will always be a classic well.
2504;But after I watched it, I found myself crying uncontroably, mostly due to how I treated homosexual people in the past.
2505;the first thing you notice after you bought it home and play it the first time is the incredible scenery the movie comes with.
2506;Then as you watch even further, you will develop an empathy with the characters, and truly feel their emotions, and their lives' story.
2507;It is quite simply a Masterpiece from it's first frame to it's last.
2508;If anything it is about two bisexual men but it is so much more than that.
2509;I will probably get heaps of unhelpful votes for the following statements but that is fine.
2510;Brokeback Mountain will go on to this type of cinematic glory.
2511;i'll stake my last breath on it.
2512;The movie is beautifully shot and memorable.
2513;Brokeback Mountain is the kind of movie that stays with you long after you have stopped viewing it.
2514;BBM is a love story, an epic one, which has never been done in gay themed movies (usually movies with gay characters as the focal point do not span anywhere near 20 years).
2515;It deservingly is the most acclaimed film of the year and should've been named best picture of the year by the academy, but who cares what they think.
2516;The same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal, who is brilliant as Jack Twist.
2517;The supporting cast is also great.
2518;I would recommend this movie to anyone, not just fellow members of the gay community, but those who enjoy a movie that is heartbreakingly beautiful and will move you to tears.
2519;If Scorsece's jealous gibe that it looks like a Marlboro commercial is true in a few shots, that's because the Marlboro commercials were beautifully shot.
2520;The hope of art is that seeing a situation from outside we can grow out of it.
2521;Brokeback is the rare Hollywood film that even attempts to work as art.
2522;It gets it all right, and is largely as simple as a fable.
2523;It is a film with an open heart.
2524;Note on Hollywood: this being by far the best film Randy Quaid has ever been in, rather than feeling pride he is suing the producers for more money after the fact.
2525;with beautiful scenery, which tells you how bad the movie was.
2526;fide success (including financially), despite active homophobic opposition.
2527;Music From The Mountain gives us a much greater appreciation of the soundtrack music and of how truly integral it is to the impact of the whole film.
2528;I've also been privileged to give a personal hug of appreciation to both Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson at their Brisbane shows, so it's a real treat to see them here as an acknowledged element of what works so beautifully in this film.
2529;i loved Annie Proulx's short story.
2530;ray version is justified for anyone who truly appreciates the film, its historical significance, and its potential to continue do great good in the world as one of the all.
2531;Anyway, two western guys shepherding high in the mountians alone one summer experience physical love.
2532;They meet years later and it's obvious the attraction is still strong.
2533;What follows is a bittersweet affair spanning many years.
2534;He's alive and willing it seems, to chuck everything and pursue a permenant life with Ennis.
2535;There they can love without fear or guilt in the vast, quiet beauty of the that place.
2536;The real winner is the spectacular beauty of the mountain.
2537;This is an Academy Award caliber movie, in small part because of the time we are in now.
2538;Aside from that, it is time well spent.
2539;This movie is just amazing, and definitely marked a new level of stardom for the main characters.
2540;Bravo Mr. Ang Lee, and everyone in this movie.
2541;Keep up the good work.
2542;I just saw this and I'm almost overcome with emotion.
2543;heartbreaking and tragic, both actors were excellent, especially ledger, a quiet, nuanced, performance.
2544;a brave movie, well done ang lee.
2545;I have friends who've been gay.
2546;bashed, so this hits close to home for me.
2547;Brokeback has the most touching subtle acting in it.
2548;Ang Lee's direction is excellent.
2549;A movie like Brokeback Mountain, which talks about oppression, and shows true romance.
2550;Brokeback Mountain IS the best movie 21st Century Hollywood has ever made.
2551;Of course, obviously, people need intelligence to appreciate the filmThis is an amazing film, a 5 star in any book.
2552;This film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters.
2553;I thought about it for weeks after I saw it the first time, and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again.
2554;it was by far the most well scripted, well acted and innovative Film of 2005.
2555;they have real feelings for each other and have genuine love for each other which they can't express openly due to the confines of Society's borders .
2556;Well, it's about a movie that is so magnificent, so well written, so incredibly superior to the average JUNK fare that is being churned out that it is beyond the scope of understanding of the average movie.
2557;This story is true for me and many others whose lives parallel the story in whole or in part.
2558;I am of quite advanced age and I can tell you this story is Biblical in its spiritual truth.
2559;The opening scenes moved slowly and there wasLedger.
2560;quiet, mumbling, in a way reminding me of James Deanin Giant with that simple presence.
2561;cowboys up there doing whatmakes men tremble at the thought of doing: making love.
2562;I managedto stay in my seat.
2563;Something touched me and my eyes misted over by film's ending and Ennis sad.
2564;like eyesthat worked so well for him, making his character easy to read.
2565;that look of devotion he gives to Ledger.
2566;Then there's the amazing Heath, a virtualtreasure trove of talent.
2567;His scenes at the end were brilliant.
2568;I said it may sound funny.
2569;My friend let out anenormous laugh.
2570;I even remembered my childhood toy gun and holster andcowboy hat.
2571;Ang Lee, famous for making art movies that explore the human soul does it again with this heartbreaking drama of two gay cowboys in the west.
2572;This is not a hyped clich movie, there are some great performances here, wonder cinematography, and screenplay writing at work here.
2573;This is what a good drama film should be.
2574;Gay bashing has always existed, and still exists.
2575;But, that it does and this movie shows the ups and downs of the aftereffects of such restrictions.
2576;And it shows what happens when two men in love have to play it straight in order to keep from getting killed.
2577;it is up to each of us to resolve the moral dilemmas in this movie.
2578;The acting is evokative, the secenery stunning, the symbolism deep.
2579;But, most importantly, it gives us all something to chew on.
2580;And just what it is that we are to value more deeply than social order is left as more of a question that we can keep asking ourselves over and over.
2581;And that question is largely, just what is love?
2582;this is another movie that is as close to the bok as you will see
2583;hopeful) that it is a total political game and not at all about which film is the best, which performance is the best, or who deserves to win.
2584;I own the film and watch it often.
2585;As heartbreaking as it is, and even though it always makes me cry, it has such a deep haunting feeling about it that draws me to it over and over again.
2586;Thank you to Ang Lee and all the actors for bringing this film to us .
2587;all of us who have watched it and learned from it are the richer for the experience.
2588;challenges aside, the movie was worth seeing.
2589;Their time together is sweet, image filled and a chance to learn more about the conversationally challenged Ennis.
2590;The movie has no agenda other than telling it's story, which is moving and beautiful.
2591;It' doesn't preach, it just puts everything up there on screen and lets you experience the movie.
2592;Ang Lee is the master of subtlety.
2593;And that's what makes the film so powerful and insightful.
2594;that brings me to the other theme the film tackles, which is self.
2595;First, let me say that Brokeback Mountain is a powerful movie and a work of art.
2596;None have moved me as much as this movie.
2597;All the actors, the writing, directing, etc. are phenominal.
2598;six year old straight male can have such understanding, compassion and depth of emotion is almost incomprehensible to me.
2599;This scene just blows me away and brings me to tears even after seeing it 5 times.
2600;Ang Lee and the screenwriters are being true to the story.
2601;The view of his childroom bedroom reveals a total bareness of emotion, love or beauty in his upbringing.
2602;Jack, in that embrace, experiences all the emotional closeness and warmth he never had from any man growing up.
2603;It must be a tremendous release to a man, born gay, but having no understanding of warmth between men.
2604;Jack returns again and again to Ennis because of the power of this early embrace.
2605;This is the best movie I have seen in a long time!
2606;It is a true love story that defines something that no one has been brave enough to produce until now.
2607;I have seen Brokeback Mountain twice, and I highly recomend you see it at least once!
2608;it won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture for director Ang Lee and was the subject of the big Oscar upset when 'Crash' won Best Picture.
2609;But despite it's labels (the gay cowboy movie) and the jokes made on it's behalf (Brownback Mountain, etc.) this movie proves to be one of the best films of 2005 and a deeply sad movie about unexpected love.
2610;Both Ennis and Jack are surprised by the sudden act, neither one of them are aware that they're gay.
2611;That's expressed in a fantastic scene as the two stand on a mountain and Ennis says You know, I ain't no queer.
2612;The two meet up and the passion is rekindled immediately.
2613;For the next 20 years the two continue their relationship, with Jack insisting that the two can live together somewhere on their own ranch.
2614;picking up a male prostitute in Mexico and forging a relationship with a man in Texas.
2615;It's about forbidden love and I'm going to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review here
2616;It shows that love can happen at anytime even with someone you least expect.
2617;This is a marvelous film, that I highly recommend.
2618;This movie stole my heart, and also helps people realize just how far the gay community has come since that time, Its great to know that my fiance and i do not have to be afraid to be who we are like they were so afraid to be in this movie.
2619;Loved the passion that they had for each other in this movie.
2620;i would highly recommend this movie to people who are afraid of their sexuality, and hopefully it will help them except who they are
2621;This movie was absolutely wonderful.
2622;The acting was superb, the cinematography was breath taking and the story was one of a great love and also of a great loss.
2623;I watched this with my husband and he enjoyed the movie as well, but I was in tears by the end of the film.
2624;What outstanding performances by the two leading men and the supporting cast.
2625;This one should have been an Acadamey Award winner for best picture.
2626;There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is.
2627;The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors.
2628;It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.
2629;But this is how I see it: Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with eachother.
2630;If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish.
2631;This is one of the most beautiful, emotionally honest, and heartbreaking films I've ever seen.
2632;That this film played in Peoria as well as to sold out crowds in San Francisco is a tribute to its artistry and powerfully universal message: that real love transcends emotional conflict, bigotry, and even death.
2633;the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, Dead White Males, etc etc.
2634;The Cowboy, the strong, self.
2635;confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.
2636;He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws
2637;OK, let's see, let's make him gay!
2638;Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling and artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is .
2639;SO that's what this movie is all about.
2640;Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.
2641;(See my review of American Beauty for another example.)
2642;But I give the movie 3 stars because much as you might HATE the agenda, the story is entertaining.
2643;Brokeback Mountain is that rarest of things.
2644;a quiet movie that seems very traditional that is actually quite revolutionary.
2645;It tells a simple story that is actaully very complicated.
2646;It looks like a simple movie yet is filled with subtle brilliance.
2647;Watch it for how a place can become a character.
2648;Watch for how many parallels exist between acts and situations throughout this wonderful film.
2649;It is a joy to have in the classics of cinema.
2650;Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.
2651;When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.
2652;Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.
2653;When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.
2654;A hundred years from now, when cinema is being discussed, Brokeback Mountain will be loved, degraded, re.
2655;And that is the mark of a truly great film.
2656;I am still befuddled that the Oscar voting swayed the best film award of 2005 to Crash, and even more perplexed by its backhanded honor to Jake Gyllenhaal with a best supporting actor nomination, when clearly, he not only gave an astonishing performance in a leading role, but was impetus behind the entire storyline.
2657;time Hollywood racial theme, Brokeback Mountain opened up a whole new can of beans.
2658;Seeing this movie is an emotional watershed, an epiphany.
2659;It confirms that art can be life.
2660;the most astonishing thing about Brokeback Mountain is the acting by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
2661;Imagine: two men in a love story, giving performances that up to now had only come from the likes of Gable and Lombard, Tracy and Hepburn, Streisand and Redford.
2662;I love it that there are so many diverse thoughts and feelings about Brokeback.
2663;acting homosexuals they actually knew until they were reminded by Jack and Ennis.
2664;I myself find it interesting that while Jack initiates, Ennis then takes the reigns, and Jack willingly succumbs to him.
2665;Throughout the movie, Jack and Ennis trade roles, so to speak.
2666;It's also fascinating that despite Ennis supposed innocence and naivte, when push comes to shove, he instantly knows exactly how to respond to Jack's advances.
2667;Not having to deal with AIDS, crowded gay dance clubs, gyms, and high fashion, Brokeback is able to maintain a beautiful simplicity.
2668;one of the most touching realities presented in Brokeback Mountain is the importance of holding on to a loved one's possessions, in this case, Ennis' blood.
2669;So much emphasis is placed on the sexual aspects occurring between men, which is a actually a tiny percentage of what homosexuality is really all about.
2670;Like Jack and Ennis, anyone can determine to bed a woman, produce children, and successfully live a lie.
2671;there is another element in this film that is as universal as its love story, the element of choice, of being true to yourself.
2672;He makes an easy choice, and the result is tragic.
2673;up man
2674;brokeback Mountain a powerful, insightful look at the glory and tragedy of love.
2675;it is a movie that will stay with you for days, years, possibly a lifetime.
2676;i encourage any fan of the ART of film to see this masterpiece.
2677;I bought a new compaq 2630 for viewing movies.
2678;bM was perfect for this project.
2679;Wide screen worked very well.
2680;No drop outs, full sound and excellent color.
2681;Jake G. and Heath L. were amazing.
2682;It's a Lifetime movie at best.
2683;It seems to address forbiden, but factual issue of today, hopefully it will help some of those who are confussed.
2684;This is the best movie I have ever seen bar none.
2685;Any filmmaker who shows me the kind of joy that these two displayed when they were together will bring me to the box office over and over again.
2686;In fact, the more wonderful it is, the sooner and more painful the ending has to be.
2687;If this movie has a flaw it is the heart stopping abruptness of the post card with DECEASED stamped across it.
2688;To all the movie producers out there, show me the joy of loving another human being and I will make your movie a hit.
2689;The acting is excellent and the scenery is beautiful.
2690;I thought tonight I was going to see the best movie of the year.
2691;With a year with amazing films like walk the line, capote, syriana, and Good night, and good luck.
2692;brokeback mountain is simply just a decent movie, but not a good one.
2693;I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of this film.
2694;Ang Lee brought a simple story and made a romantic,sad,touching film.
2695;Heath and Jake were so convincing that you forget they are actors.
2696;Michelle Williams is an actress to watch in the future.
2697;She has found a place in film history.
2698;In my eyes, Brokeback has won Best Picture.
2699;There are so many levels of this brilliant movie.
2700;Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as man who is trapped in a love that is not enough and too weak to accept what there is.
2701;Michele Williams' innocence is so fragile.
2702;the conversion to Blu Ray is beautiful.
2703;The vistas of mountains are so beautiful.
2704;what the heck was I expecting!The opening scene is among the most humbly beautiful things I've seen in movies and really sets the scene for the time and place, which is Wyoming 1963.
2705;The tension and attraction between the characters Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist is developed so realistically
2706;ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist take up a job together one summer herding sheep up on Brokeback Mountain.
2707;the story of Brokeback Mountain unfolds before you with great subtlety
2708;top, outrageous or try to push a view onto anyone, and for that, I admire.
2709;It is gentle and satisfying, yet deeply tragic.
2710;nothing prepares you for this achingly beautiful, honest and profound movie that surpasses being a movie, and to be frank, becomes a life force that will embed itself forever into your memory.
2711;Movies this good don't come along often.
2712;The movie is a cinematic masterpiece.
2713;Previous reviews will give you a rundown on the story line, and masterful direction of Ang Lee.
2714;On a rating of 1 to 5 I'd give it a 6.
2715;I will start by saying Ang Lee's directing is another subject, as it is one of the most stunningly filmed movies I have ever seen.
2716;I do believe, however, that one is brave in watching it.
2717;If you have ever loved someone in your life, or let a feeling pass by without its communication .
2718;By the end of this movie, every one of those moments will come heaping down upon you, and you will understand the magic of the story.
2719;Watch this movie, and you will find yourself in one of the characters.
2720;Watch it and it will tell you something about yourself.
2721;it is a love story, but this time it is not impossible.
2722;There is a lot of gushing by the 5.
2723;Rural guys in this area really do act like those in the movies.
2724;The initial sex scene was very believable.
2725;The pacing of the story fits the rural pace of life.
2726;But that often is how life is.
2727;Thank you to everyone involved.
2728;Thank you to everyone involved.
2729;What can I say?Ang Lee did a great job, portraying these two guys in love.
2730;He did it so masterfully that I totally forgot that the two leadings are men.
2731;Ang Lee is simply a genius.
2732;the acting is another strength of this movie.
2733;Roberta Maxwell as Jake's mother is perfect.
2734;You can see her pain, when Ennis leaves, because she knows that another part of her son is gone now forever.
2735;ledger did most challenging job and he was definitely the right one to do it.
2736;He played this Ennis del Mar so perfectly and nuanced that you actually think he IS Ennis del Mar!
2737;bokeback Mountain is one the saddest but at the same time one the most beautiful movies I have seen in my life.
2738;If you see it and like it, I encourage you to watch it twice.
2739;This movie has touched my heart in every way its a real epic and I think that heath ledger should've won that oscar cuz his acting was superb
2740;I wholeheartedly agree with the general consensus of the reviewers of this film.
2741;I saw this movie last night, and I still feel affected by it.
2742;The performances by the two male leads were so convincing and heartfelt, that when the ending came, I was actually unhappy about what had happened with these characters.
2743;All the reviews are sort of funny.
2744;I rate movies on their entertainment value.
2745;That fact that this film is met with as much fear and hatred as it is with love and acceptance is to me a testament to its impact.
2746;Perhaps this film is not for everyone, but I found it to be exquisitely articulated and by far one of the finest films I have ever seen.
2747;This film depicts true love.
2748;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely phenomenal!!!
2749;These two amazing gentlemen captured human emotions and feelings so fantastically I cannot explain.
2750;Heath was exceptional as Ennis!
2751;He just brought the character to life and made us understand where he was coming from and how difficult it was for him to accept what he was feeling, wanting, and going through.
2752;One of my favorite scenes is when he and Jake say goodbye and Jake's looking at him walk away through the car side mirror.
2753;The kissing scenes and the scenes of them lying down together were magnificent.
2754;Although the scenes had something to do with sexuality they also had to do with human release and being at peace and ease with another human soul.
2755;There was so much art and beauty shown in this film that you can't help but watch it again and again.
2756;The maturity and depth shown in this movie is outstanding.
2757;I give both Jake and Heath props for their incredible portrayal of two human souls in the most beautiful and realistic way.
2758;This film has made me an even bigger fan of both Heath and Jake.
2759;I respect them and their talent so much now.
2760;But also because they portrayed the male species in a more humanly beautiful way than I have ever seen on film.
2761;I really enjoyed this film because it was so mature and so real.
2762;I also loved Michelle Williams's portrayal of Ennis's devastated wife.
2763;She was right on the money in every scene.
2764;I also loved Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife.
2765;All and all the actors were great.
2766;The feel of the film was so real and intense.
2767;This will probably be one of my favorite films for a long time to come!
2768;If you are open minded, then I can tell you that you will love this movie.
2769;In fact, I loved it ever since the first time I seen it, and have recommended everyone I know to watch it ever since.
2770;BBM is a true masterpiece
2771;disc collector's edition is worth watching again and again.
2772;The bonus features are so good.
2773;I always cry each time I see it.
2774;The performances of Heath (sigh) as Ennis and Jake as Jack, along of course w/Ang Lee's masterful direction, are terrific.
2775;The screenplay by Mr. McMurtry and Ms. Ossana is perfect.
2776;All in all, what a great film!!
2777;Heath was definitely robbed of best actor, as Jake was of best supporting actor,.
2778;The beautiful cinematography was not rewarded also.
2779;This movie is amazing for a couple.
2780;Two, it is a good story, and makes you feel all emotions possible.
2781;I found this movie to be very much a love story.
2782;To span over two decades, they are simply two human beings in love.
2783;Very moving and the scenery was beautiful.
2784;I was overcome with emotion.
2785;But I was pleasantly surprise by the touching, tender portrayal of this movie.
2786;I must rate this as THE BEST LOVE STORY I have ever watched on a screen.
2787;Because they understood each other so completely.
2788;lonely, and also incredibly joyous that such a connection could be possible.
2789;Strong dramatic performances from all and a great tribute to Heath Ledger's work.
2790;Ang Lee tackles the subject of two gay men falling in love in the rural 60's and how things actually were back then with tenderness and brutal honesty.
2791;A great, and in my humble option, much needed, piece of work.
2792;written, beautifully acted, perfectly directed masterpiece.
2793;I have rarely been so moved by a movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a film that completely absorbs you and makes your heart ache for the characters.
2794;This was the best movie i have ever seen.
2795;The story is amazing, the scenery is amazing, the acting is fantastic.
2796;Whether it is about a gay couple or not, it was an amazing love story.
2797;Some are (involuntarily) funny, some are spectacular, some scary.
2798;And interestingly, the ones that touch us the most, are the ones that don't happen.
2799;My list of all time favourite Hollywood couples: Rick and Ilsa, Karen von Blixen and Denys Finch Hatton and of course Rose and Jack .
2800;Brokeback Mountain, better known as the gay Western, is really a love story.
2801;The end of the summer also seems to be the end of their romance.
2802;Actually, the intense performance by Ledger and Gyllenhaal makes you forget that this is a same sex relationship.
2803;The longing and pain they show are so immediate, they become universal.
2804;But despite all obstacles, the two cowboys share a few moments of happiness and thanks to Ang Lee's divine direction, we get to share them, too.
2805;I just saw this movie today with my sister and I can't believe I waited so long to see it.
2806;Thank you very much to everyone who opened themselves up to a firestorm in order to do a wonderful, heart.
2807;opening personal experience
2808;rare especially in broader 'market cinema'.
2809;Many condemn these movies as a knee.
2810;This has been a great year for movies, with many making very important points (which in my world means moviemaking at its best
2811;Munich and Good Night and Good Luck and perhaps Crash certainly deserve more awards.
2812;and people came out thoughtful and moved.
2813;And that right there is a testament to how we're FINALLY, if slowly, growing as a society.
2814;lewis and Stowe's Last of the Mohicans.
2815;I love you, still unspoken.
2816;but now able to cry, and promise Jack what he could not in life.
2817;A movie with a message that, like the protestations of love that so many feel are necessary to *portray* love, connection, loss.
2818;challenging
2819;Them I respect, despite my reservations about the lifestyle.
2820;i've gotten a bit far afield here, but I'll come back to the beginning long enough to thank everyone in here once more for their willingness to stick it out there.
2821;With discussion comes learning
2822;to learn from each other and in that way find greater Understanding and Love.
2823;May love and wonder work within us ALL.
2824;MOVIE: When a movie has generated as much public interest as this one has, it's hard to go into the film with an open mind.
2825;The story is genuine and it works on every level.
2826;After spending lots of time alone in the wilderness a friendship is born that leads to a passion for one another.
2827;What Ang Lee does with this film is bring an immense appreciation for the setting and the surroundings.
2828;Cinematography is a sure win come Oscar night for Brokeback Mountain.
2829;Ang Lee takes the time to stop and look at the beauty of nature and how it envelopes the characters in this paradise from the rest of civilization and the rest of their lives.
2830;This forbidden love soon starts to work against them when word gets out.
2831;Relationships with their wives are shattered, and society shuns them, which leads to the very emotional ending.
2832;aCTING: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give great performances, but I don't think it's going to win them any Oscar gold.
2833;Michelle Williams gives an amazing performance as Ledger's outcast wife, who ultimately uncovers his secret life.
2834;The acting is top notch, all of them do fine work.
2835;The characters are fleshed out and they feel real, and that is what may make this the frontrunner for Oscar's Best Picture.
2836;on th e upside, the cinematography and scenery were quite beautiful.
2837;minded convention and show this great film.
2838;Both Ledger and Gyllenhaal gave superb performances.
2839;aged cinephile I'm saying a lot when I say that this is the most moving and most wonderful film that I have ever seen.
2840;Exceptionally good performances all round .
2841;fantastic direction, writing and music.
2842;It was robbed of the best movie Oscar .
2843;but it's in very good company there.
2844;watch it and, if you allow it to, it could do what only the most powerful works of art can do .
2845;I was so excited to watch this film.
2846;The 3 Academy Awards it won, the love story, the gorgeous mountain scenery, the incredible acting.
2847;I continue to be Heath and Jake's fan, but not from this one!
2848;I cried during and after the movie.
2849;recalls many of my relationships from the past and renews me with feelings of love.
2850;It is so true that Heath Ledger is truly incredible here as Ennis, and Jake Gyllenhaal will break your heart as Jack.
2851;It seems to flow easier with each viewing, and you catch a little more of what you missed each time.
2852;At least BAFTA recognized Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance as Jack Twist.
2853;Regardless of what we are born with, we make of life what we can and we play the cards we are dealt.
2854;Thats what makes Brokeback Mountain timeless .
2855;Growth comes slowly and emotional growth is fraught with pain.
2856;All of us can look back at choices made and regretted.
2857;She did, but like all great art it was predicated on an underlying truth: love is a force of nature.
2858;Ang Lee, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry and everyone who worked on this movie transformed a New Yorker short story into one of the centuries' epic morality tales.
2859;its moral is love or die, and the corollary to that moral is God gives you no choice in whom you love because we are commanded to love everyone as yourself.
2860;It is worth seeing over and over and over again.
2861;This movie will be on the 100 best list for centuries.
2862;This is a very good movie.
2863;It is a masterpiece all around.
2864;For the acting, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have perfect acting for this movie.
2865;Others are also good in this particular movie.
2866;For the direction, it is perfect, Ang Lee.
2867;I know that this movie maybe quite ambitious, but it turns out to be good.
2868;So, it is a good one.
2869;It is about touching love and romance, so it is kind of not applicable here.
2870;For the music, I feel so enjoyable as I hear the music in the middle of the scenes because they are so relaxing.
2871;For the sound effects, it is good too.
2872;Therefore, this movie is recommended all the time.
2873;both by the powerful content and the stunning delivery.
2874;otherwise, the natural scenery is unbelievable, beautiful mountains, animals, rivers, men (!)
2875;Not only did he stayed true to the story, he enhanced the emotions, and the essence to the story for the readers.
2876;The master filmtography, the extraordinary music, and the fantastic actors in this movie further enhances what this movie brings to its viewers, which is a true demonstration of humanity.
2877;this movie deserves all the honors it received.
2878;In fact, I will even give this movie the honor of the best movie of the year, and a true art masterpiece.
2879;tell you that it is infinitely more than that.
2880;Jack Twist is the sensitive and optimistic one.
2881;His evocation of Ennis Del Mar are spectacular.
2882;While it is too early in this young actors career to go too far out on a limb, I predict that when all is said and done, this may be the role he is known for!
2883;It is obivous that he knows this character well.
2884;fit performance as Jack Twist.
2885;The shots of the Wyoming (actually, Canadian) landscape are awesome, and match the film's emotional beauty with physical beauty.
2886;as said, this film is about a 20 year love affair that tests its characters to their limits.
2887;It is love story that is (unlike every other love story) not at all cliche as it adds this extra dimension.Yes, the film is a character film and as such, it moves slow.
2888;this is time well spent.
2889;Every minute of this film is there for a reason
2890;Everything culminates into these three lines.
2891;the story allows people a peak into the hidden, but ugly side of society that still exist today.
2892;Yet even through the tragedy, it portrayed love to its finest.
2893;definitely a film worth watching.
2894;So I was quite surprised when I saw two major Western Movie stars acting out a movie that is so delicate.
2895;This movie, obviously, moved my very spirit, but I was more surprised to find that the western society is able to produce a movie with such degrees of beauty.
2896;the acting is stellar from all.
2897;The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen.
2898;The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood.
2899;the basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'.
2900;The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them.
2901;an unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic.
2902;It has all the right elements.
2903;It has a lot to say about life and love.
2904;Every year the world gets at least one controversial film that is hailed by critics, and usually wins a lot of awards.
2905;but maybe the critics are right in this case.
2906;I went into the movie with an open mind, ready to have my beliefs challenged.
2907;Through the years Ennis and Jack spend continue with their real lives, with those few days a year they can see each other when they are in total bliss.
2908;some people see this movie as a great tradgedy because these two men love each other but can't be together.
2909;The fact that these two characters are hurting their loved one's doesn't seem to matter much to the people praising this film.
2910;i will admit that the acting is good, and the cinatography is beautiful, but I can't in all honesty recommend a movie where the main characters seem to okay with hurting people they care about, with very few consequences.
2911;This film is wonderful in every sense of the word.
2912;the scenery, the acting, the story.
2913;It's beautiful and heartbreaking in such a profound way.
2914;This is a love story.
2915;Looking beyond the fact that this is a story about two cowboys that fall in love is a feat within itself.
2916;it really goes to the core of what it must be like to outwardly deny that love that you want the world to see.
2917;Their love (the word love is introduced at the end of the movie) is thwarted because of internalized social norms.
2918;The internalized social norms are played brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
2919;great acting by all other actors and actresses to the extent that you can see the story through any randomly selected character in the movie.
2920;it gets you thinking: if our social norms when internalized, as all are inevitably, may deny us happiness, what is the meaning of them, are we actually opressed and not even realizing it?I'm giving it a 5 star review because this is the only movie which made me think in years.
2921;ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him.
2922;sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie.
2923;All in all if you like simple romances and expect a simple movie/with simple concepts than you will enjoy this movie.
2924;hopeful this is just a drop in the bucket for future films/the country.
2925;I had to travel over 3 years one way to see it firsthand.
2926;The film is a whole world of emotions.
2927;The story is very very real.
2928;i know the story by heart having lived most of it.
2929;The actors are beyond excellent as is the story and script.
2930;Ang Lee's direction is pure art unto it's self.
2931;bBM is a film that will always haunt you once you see it.
2932;I think Lee and the writers made sure of it with a piece of work that touches all who see it.
2933;It will make you think and make you feel.
2934;This film is that real.
2935;bBM is a film set out to advance the human heart.
2936;Not many other films can boost such an achievement.
2937;I applaud the director's concept of show.
2938;casing bigotry, etc, but at least give us a character who's worthy of rooting for.
2939;i absolutely loved this movie.
2940;it grabbed my heart and held it in a sweet embrace only to rip it out leaving me in tears.
2941;this was a beautiful love story.
2942;There is a cord of universal truth that Ang Lee strikes through the film's central relationship, and the director explores with unerring grace and sensitivity the heartbreak that results from its inability to grow into something real and definable.
2943;Ennis (a flooring Ledger) and Jack (a very good Gyllenhaal) are constantly at odds with the constructs of their society, and as a result, their relationship remains perpetually thwarted
2944;Lee draws the trajectory of their relationship with notable restraint, mirroring the social climate of 60s/70s Wyoming and also hinting at the insatiable thirst for personal freedom that writes underneath its machismo.

2948;Brokeback Mountain is not a gay cowboy movie in the most fundamental sense
2949;Very fine acting by all with a special nod to Anne Hathaway.
2950;luckily I got to see this at the theatre.
2951;The film should have garnished academy award nominations for Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger and Linda Cardellini: And definitely, the film should have won best picture.
2952;All I can say is
2953;A Golden Globe Winner and Oscar nominee for Best Picture!
2954;Heath Ledger (Golden Globe and Oscar nominated for Best Actor) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor) gives their best performances of their careers!
2955;The supporting cast led by Michelle Williams (Golden Globe and Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress) and Anne Hathaway is excellent!
2956;Ang Lee's directing (Oscar winner for Best Director) is brilliant and also won him a second Golden Globe for Best Director, his first since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)!
2957;The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana (Golden Globe and Oscar Winner for Best Adapted Screenplay), based on E. Annie Proulx's short story, is brilliant!
2958;The music by Gustavo Santaolalla (Golden Globe Nominated and Oscar winner For Best Original Score and Winner For Best Original Song A Love That Will Never Grow Old, which was sung by Emmylou Harris) is brilliant!
2959;The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Oscar nominated for Best Cinematography) is brilliant!
2960;The film editing by Geraldine Peroni (who was nominated for an Oscar for the film editing work she did for Robert Altman's The Player (1992) and Dylan Tichenor is excellent!
2961;The casting by Deb Green and Avy Kaufman (who did the casting for Lee's Hulk (2003), Ride With The Devil (1999), and The Ice Storm (1997) is excellent!
2962;The production design by Judy Becker is brilliant!
2963;The art direction by Laura Ballinger (co. art director) is brilliant!
2964;The costume design by Marit Allen (who did the costume design to Lee's Hulk (2003) and Ride With The Devil (1999) is brilliant!
2965;This is a brilliant and sad film from the man that brought us Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and Sense and Sensibility (1995)!
2966;This is one of last year's best!
2967;Between the writing, the acting, the emotion of the story and the breathtaking scenery beautiful is the best description of this film.
2968;This film wonderfully combines score, cinematography, script and acting while being expertly directed by a master, Ang Lee.
2969;Ang Lee was awarded the Oscar , Golden Globe and the Director's Guild award for his direction of Brokeback Mountain.
2970;The story is one of a never fully realized love that suffers from what society deems love should be.
2971;The acting by the entire cast is first rate.
2972;Brokeback Mountain is a ground breaking film that i will still consider years from now as one of my all time favorites!
2973;beautiful direction, acting, and the score is haunting.
2974;it is that powerful, beautiful and raw with emotion.
2975;thank you, Heath Ledger, for your talent, courage and for giving us a remarkable performance that opened our eyes and hearts.
2976;one of the best movies EVER!!
2977;course Hollywood will still blackball you if you come out of the closet) so it really was/is still brave to do this part.
2978;This film broke my heart.
2979;The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission.
2980;The actors' portrayals of these characters was almost disturbingly realistic, believable and moving.
2981;This is a truly great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone who can look beyond the simple fact that this tragic romance takes place between two men.
2982;In his innermost self, he knows awful truth.
2983;At its core, Brokeback is a romance that focuses on repressed love, longing, and the struggles of relationships.
2984;the performances by Heath and Jake are extraordinary, the scenery is fantastic, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score is beautifully haunting.
2985;The love, pain, and desire that all of the characters feel is completely believable
2986;the same year it came out in the New Yorker (1997) Diana Ossana read it and brought it to the attention of her writing partner the venerable Larry McMurtry the writer of an epic novel about the friendship of two men and the lengths each man would go for the other in the remarkable Lonesome Dove.
2987;They shopped this screenplay around for years with people telling them it was a great script with heart and pathos and yet ultimately couldn't be made in Hollywood because of it's subject matter.
2988;many have stated that this is a grand or epic love story.
2989;It's more complicated than that.
2990;the need to be loved .
2991;It speaks to the human heart and its capacity for love .
2992;I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males.
2993;I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on.
2994;Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure.
2995;Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well.
2996;I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack.
2997;there's something about this film that simply, well, gets under your skin.
2998;And it stays there until you DO something about it, until you process what your trip to Brokeback Mountain has been for you.
2999;personal place in the viewer's soul.
3000;brokeback Mountain is a story of joy, of hope, of disappointment, of regret, and much, much more.
3001;It's a truly human film, and it spans the twenty.
3002;some year relationship of two friends, possibly soul mates.
3003;This story juxtaposes the power of society's structure and conditioning with the undeniable power of awareness of one's personal truth.
3004;And yes, Brokeback Mountain is a story of love, a love that could be neither denied nor fulfilled.
3005;this movie is delicate and subtle as it is thundering and raw.
3006;It has beautiful scenery, (many panoramic shots are of the Kananaskis Valley in Alberta, Canada), and very real, believable people who interact, at times, with soul.
3007;and about Ang Lee, the film's masterful director .
3008;he doesn't tell you what to think, but he certainly gets you thinking!
3009;i have thought a great deal about many aspects of this film.
3010;regards and peace to all.
3011;I absolutely adore this movie.
3012;it's a wonderful romance story about 2 ordinary people who fall in love, who happen to be two men, and in the time period it was set it wasn't an ordinary situation to say the least.
3013;We have all felt the passion and the warmth of love, we've all felt the hurt and heartache love can bring us as well.
3014;this is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
3015;Brilliant performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
3016;As the closing credits rolled I felt that I had just witnessed something politically important and cinematically poetic.
3017;Beautifully shot and languidly paced over a twenty.year span without the MTV style quick cuts movies have adopted to the detriment of most.
3018;McMurtry and Ossana beautifully fleshed out the tale just enough to capture the spirit and soul of these people trapped in a hell worthy of Sartre.
3019;The sparseness of the script allows the audience to fill in the spaces with their own interpretations, creating an engaging experience.
3020;heath and Jake create memorable characters by leaving much unsaid .
3021;Gyllenhaal builds upon the stride forward witnessed in Jarhead and leaves us curious as to what comes next.
3022;His ability to convey Jack's recognition that his future could never be as romanticized as his past is beautifully conveyed by only his stare as Ennis drives off.
3023;Michelle Williams' performance of a woman who knows too much too late is revelatory .
3024;finely balancing a role that could have easily become unsympathetic while recognizing the nuance of victimization.
3025;Hathaway, while having little screen time, slips beautifully out of her fluffy tiara persona into a crown of thorn and captures her character's evolution from young Texas spitfire to aging brass beautifully as she truly becomes her daddy's little girl turning brittle from the deprivation of a storybook ending.
3026;i'm surprised to see some reviewers focusing on this film as one that glorifies lies and adultery and I have to wonder if we saw the same movie.
3027;It's a spiritual movie about everyone's need to find his or her place in the world.
3028;As this film leaves a lasting impression on the audience .
3029;and creates conversation it fully succeeds as art and deserves any awards it receives.
3030;This can happen in heterosexual relationships as well.
3031;What a humble reply from a remarkably gifted actor.
3032;It seemed that Brokeback deserved the Oscar for Best Movie, as Ledger probably merited the Best Actor award.
3033;The shipping was fast and prompt which was good because I used it as a Christmas gift.
3034;The movies was a little scratched up though which was unfortunate but it still played perfectly.
3035;Due to the breathtaking cinematography, heart.
3036;wrenchingly exquisite script, and flawless acting of Brokeback Mountain, this film has inevitably joined the ranks of my top ten movies.
3037;Brokeback Mountain is so much more than the gay cowboy movie numerous sources have labeled it as .
3038;it is a tragic love story which, in my opinion, rivals such classics as Romeo and Juliet.
3039;i only hope that Brokeback continues to move viewers in the way that is has moved me.
3040;Due to the breathtaking cinematography, heart.
3041;wrenchingly exquisite script, and flawless acting of Brokeback Mountain, this film has inevitably joined the ranks of my top ten movies.
3042;Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story which, in my opinion, rivals such classics as Romeo and Juliet.
3043;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed the incredible connection between two lovers better than most actor/actress pairings I've seen.
3044;i only hope that Brokeback continues to move viewers in the way that is has moved me.
3045;This is a beautiful film.
3046;It is about friendship and love.
3047;The actors are excellent and the location is breathtaking.
3048;That seems especially clear when this film wins the Golden Globe for best drama and the two top acting awards go to Philip Seymour Hoffman and Felicity Huffman for playing a gay man and a transgender man.
3049;So the point being made about courage is valid enough, but given that Brokeback Mountain will be the most successful film to have love scenes between two men it does represent a hurdle of sort in American pop culture.
3050;The film provides sketches of the relationship between Ennis and Jack.
3051;Images and music end up revealing more than words and it is significant that when the depth of the love between Ennis and Jack is revealed that there is only images and music, and not a word is spoken.
3052;The credit that is due director Ang Lee ultimately has to do with bringing these people together to make this movie and tell this story in this particular way.
3053;The storyline moved along pretty slowly, and the love scenes were kind of violent, which was very awkward to me.
3054;As you are viewing the film, notice all of the visual clues throughout every scene.
3055;I knew that was an omen of something to come.
3056;First film of its kind.
3057;A true heartbreaking story about love and it's denial.
3058;Ang Lee is a genius of cinema and human emotion on many levels.
3059;This film was denied best picture because of it's subject matter by a community in which many of the same people helped build and made it America's royalty.
3060;This film in time will be regarded an American classic!
3061;All things are said about this wonderful and haunting film.
3062;I made me stay up all night after the first view and I had to see it again the next day.
3063;I funny and logic to see the reviews spreading in utter two sides: totally not or totally perfect.
3064;Well, I logic in a sence it presents two kinds of people: the ones who feel and have a heart, the ones who do not.
3065;If that's the case, Michael Bay is a genius.
3066;As for the film, it's pretty much a masterpiece.
3067;Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal combined to make the best movie ever filmed.
3068;This movie is unforgettable, and will truly change who you are, and how you look at the world.
3069;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely superb in Brokeback Mountain.
3070;They drew you into their characters and caused you to feel their joy and sorrows.
3071;The cinematography is beautiful, but one can find equally stunning visuals in better movies.
3072;The story, acting, and visuals were superb, nearly every frame of this movie is elegant and beautiful.
3073;But the best was saved for the last.
3074;The ending is one of the most perfect put on film, subtle yet devastating in its emotional power.
3075;Take the west, its majestic views and quiet nights.
3076;It starts to envelope the goodness of the heart and the heart says I must hide.
3077;This movie is so brilliantly done.
3078;The WHOLE movie is beautiful.
3079;After it is all said and done, you will feel totally renewed on life and appreciate everyone (especially your partner) so much more.
3080;I read good reviews about this movie.
3081;The story line had the potential to make a good movie, but it just wasn't there.
3082;make were possible, I'd say cut the sex.
3083;This movie deserves the 3 academy awards for its excellent acting .
3084;sure, it's a good thing that this movie was made, if only to bring forth the fact, that gay people are not freaks of nature or abomination from hell as repeatedly told to us by the conservative righteous holier.
3085;i much preferred SOLDIER'S GIRL which is an extremely moving true story that shows the drastic impact and consequences, when we are dealing with hatred, bigotry, ignorance, homo.
3086;one of my favorite movies, yes 100% better than P. s. I love u. which I absolutely HATED!
3087;This is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen.
3088;It was beautifully done, handling a sensitive subject with tenderness and intelligence.
3089;I watched this movie several times and enjoyed it every time.
3090;By now, of course, everyone knows the general plot.
3091;As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.
3092;The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.
3093;the story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.
3094;Naturally, a bond develops between them.
3095;There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.
3096;The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.
3097;I found myself constantly looking at my watch.
3098;i commend Brokeback Mountain for its breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject and some great acting.
3099;This is a compelling story since it is set in a time and place where being a gay man is not acceptable.
3100;I found it thought provoking and sad.
3101;overs to help us understand each character's backstory.
3102;As touching as Ledger's pouting tight.
3103;Now that gay films are more skilfully written and acted, they are more accessible to straight people.
3104;And they leave this film in the dust with regard to brilliant dialogue, backstory, likeable characters, excellent editing and character development.
3105;Brokeback Mountain is a unique, brilliant and well acted movie.
3106;I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I found myself loving it.
3107;There was stunning scenery and a fantastic score, amazing script and last but not least, some of the best acting we've seen in many years.
3108;What follows is a moving story of two men trying to come to grips with their feelings for each other and their family life at home with their wives and children.
3109;this is a must see for everyone.
3110;It's one of the best movies I've seen in such a long time and this was thoroughly enjoyable.
3111;Ennis and Jack, well they found each other, had sex, and parted when the job's contract was up.
3112;as well as their wives and kids.
3113;It treated such things actually in an incredibly sensitive manner, suprisingly.
3114;I've seen far more emotional movies (not of the gay genre) that winning so many awards perplexed me.
3115;I've seen much more emotional movies than this.
3116;good thing the majority of the world has evolved beyond that.
3117;evolve you back to ape.
3118;It isn't pretty, glossed over fantasy from Hollywood.
3119;But a very stark portrayal of what happens when people are forced to conform to what is considered to be normal.
3120;the acting by all is top notch.
3121;true to life and worthy of oscar consideration.
3122;I loved it when I saw it the first time, but I was caught up in the story then.
3123;With a second viewing I appreciated the brilliance of the achievement even more.
3124;I hope it wins every award it is nominated for.
3125;As a recent widow I could relate in my grief to those stares and found camaderie and comfort.
3126;when I got the paper back on Thursday, I was surprised to have received an A+.
3127;The professor thinks I make a good argument, and my ideas are provocative.
3128;I wish I can take the credit for this grade, but I owe it all to Ms. Anne Proulx and Mr. Ang Lee and their masterpiece Brokeback Mountain.
3129;But there's one catch: they really, really like doing things together.
3130;Anyone who's been through that experience or anything similar will surely identify with the characters in this film, to some extent.
3131;so Ennis and Jack promise to be Best Friends Forever while agreeing to keep it on the downlow, so to speak, as they both get married and start their lives in earnest.
3132;Again, this is a movie that nearly every American male will relate to, though perhaps some more than others.
3133;Certain scenes replayed in my thoughts a lot .
3134;the Best Picture of the Year!
3135;scratcher from a few years back, A Beautiful Mind, that gets audiences and even some critics so stirred up, but they are certainly not what might be considered noteworthy.
3136;Now, this film is actually very beautifully shot.
3137;The scenery is just breathtaking.
3138;In fact, I constantly found my mind and my eye being drawn to the composition of the shots and grandeur of the landscapes, leaving me completely bored by the melodrama being played out in it's proscenium.
3139;There is one award worthy, performance in the film given by Michelle Williams as the betrayed wife of one of the two leads.
3140;Her characterization was strong, sympathetic and very moving overall.
3141;What I find the most interesting about all the excitement surrounding this film is that there was another film out this year with a similar plot line and situation to this film entitled, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.
3142;Granted, Crash ended up with best picture and best song went to It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp, so there is clearly still room for improvement.
3143;This movie tells a story of two men, who happened to be in love with each other and spent their entire lives leading a double life.
3144;The entire movie centered around their relationship, their friendship and their love.
3145;For me, Ledger was quite surprising since he was really good in this movie.
3146;The production values proves to be high and the dialogue overall, proves to be excellent.
3147;First one and a very important one is that there seem to be a definite lack of chemistry between the two male lovers.
3148;A major weakness by Ang Lee who otherwise directed a fine movie.
3149;But you should see it at least once.
3150;Thanks to Aimee and Jaguar, it been done before so there's no originality issue but its an interesting character study.
3151;What this reviewer forgot to answer, is why.
3152;The movie utilized true drama, and thoughts, protraying a love story that will last till the end of time.
3153;A good movie about a love that just can't get it together.
3154;There is one scene early on, as I suppose there must be, that leaves you with absolutely no doubt that these two young men began a sexual relationship.
3155;To me anyway, worth a repeat watch, especially if I'm feeling soulful and sad anyway.
3156;NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north.
3157;Nobody can have it all.
3158;This movie simply puts the energy of love, in all her glory on display,for the world to witness,and lessons are taught as she is betrayed.
3159;i think one of the reasons why this movie is so profound to millions of people, is because straights can witness that gay love is just like theirs.
3160;Love is the common bond between all of us here on this green earth, and Brokeback Mountain illustrates that beautifully.
3161;It really pulls a lot of emotional strings.
3162;The awards I would give it are.
3163;Ang Lee, Best Lead Actor Heath Ledger, Best Supporting Actor Jake Gyllenhall, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Score, Best Cinematography.
3164;And was completely amazed at how great this film is.
3165;Forget the whole gay cowboy thing and just watch good cinema!
3166;Sad and lovely, poignant and bold, the film shows the unique crafting that Ang Lee provokes from the cinematographers, actors and musicians he works with.
3167;There are very few directors today that can make a moment on film as thought and emotion provoking as the scene of Ennis' and Jack's reunion.
3168;or the moment when Jack's mom finally meets the love she knew he had.
3169;Simply beautiful.5 stars, more if it were possible.
3170;I thank Annie and Ang for telling such an exceedingly moving story in such a poetic way.
3171;I hope people world over can realize via the movie that love between 2 men could be every bit as pure, dignified and precious as love between a man and a woman.
3172;looking guys playing Ennis and Jack did help a great deal.
3173;Don't get me wrong, it's a nice film with a moving story and decent acting.
3174;Heath Ledger did quite well with the role of Ennis, FOR Heath Ledger.
3175;again, it is a nice, thoughtful film and worth a look, but it is miles away from deserving a Best Picture nod, especially given the superior caliber of its fellow nominees.
3176;And I was right, it did.
3177;But I also liked it a lot more than I expected I would.
3178;The scenery, music, editing and acting come together to produce a beautiful, thoughtful and tragic story that has a lot to say about the nature of human relationships and what we need and value in them.
3179;On the contrary, I was completely absorbed and deeply affected by this beautiful, passionate, and heartbreaking movie.
3180;There are many scenes I watch over and over, marvelling at the superb acting, the intricately woven score, and breathtaking scenery.
3181;This brought extra depth to the characters and helped me appreciate the movie even more.
3182;It is great to read all of the expertly written, positive reviews on this site and know many others have taken this movie to heart.
3183;i was very disappointed Crash won best picture over BBM.
3184;Jake's portrayal of Jack was simply mesmerizing.
3185;He was also wonderful in Lovely and Amazing, The Good Girl, Proof and Jarhead.
3186;At least Ang Lee won his much deserved Oscar.
3187;I hope he continues to push the envelope and make movies which stir the soul as BBM did mine.
3188;I have to say, now that I've seen Brokeback Mountain, that Crash deserved to win.
3189;To create a contrast between their love affair and their real.
3190;I am happy that we have come along way since then.
3191;I have a very open mind.
3192;I did enjoy this movie, not because it was an epic love story, but rather because it had some good acting and beautiful cinimatography.
3193;Michelle Williams was especially good at portraying a heartbroken wife upon seeing her husband make out with a guy.
3194;All in all, I'm telling people this was a good movie, but the premise definitely could have been more realistic and emotional.
3195;Ennis never makes a decent wage.
3196;the two lead actors do their parts well, and there's beautiful Wyoming scenery, but this film really did no great service to the gay community as far as I am concerned
3197;Two married with children people leave their vows and families to pursue love.
3198;Poorly written and acted, although nicely photographed .
3199;The rest of us can appreciate a love story between two men at a time when it wasnt acceptable, much less tolerated.
3200;The understated relationship between these guys is what makes the film so good.
3201;I loved it and will see it again.
3202;This is a wonderful and powerfully touching movie.
3203;The 'it' being the love he has for Jack.
3204;Arguments will ensue on what made each of them the way they are, but the philosophical underpinning of this movie that makes it touch the fiber of every man is the love of a father, and how that can help frame one's destiny.
3205;captured on a backdrop of beautiful breathtaking scenery a love story evolves amidst the volatile uncertainty of the 60s.
3206;asked What are the three most important, and perhaps the three most misunderstood words in a relationship?
3207;The reader, as well as the movie goer encounters these words by understanding as Rose in Myles' book understands it's about, Having no expectations.
3208;You expect the person who tells you I love you, that they love you too.
3209;Each in their own way, add a dimension that forces the audience to empathize and commiserate with Ennis and Jack.
3210;Michelle Williams is probably the standout as she gives men something to hate, when we really want someone to understand us and let us be.
3211;Likewise, as haunting and unforgettable are the few chosen words and expressions Jack's mother offers Ennis before providing him with a brown paper bag for his own.
3212;He loved him as deeply as men in those days were silent about loving, even their own sons.
3213;That's what makes this movie a tragically beautiful true to life story.
3214;I will not destroy the ending, but the scene with Jack's father was to me, one of the more poignant and spoke volumes about acceptance, affirmation and the accountability that good fathers need to have of themselves to make sure they raise sons that love themselves.
3215;Go see it, 'without expectations.'
3216;This is a fantastic movie but very sad.
3217;the one good thing about this movie was the beautiful scenery and cinematography.
3218;This is a film about two people who honestly do love each other.
3219;Does such love still exist in the world?
3220;Ennis and Jack's story proves that you don't need to be married to the person you love, and you don't even have to see them everyday to still be in love with them.
3221;Their story elevates love to a whole new level, and the sexual aspect of it becomes secondary.
3222;this is the sort of pure and divine love story that I wish Schools would show their kids to teach them about real life.
3223;they would certainly be more grounded individuals and more true to their hearts.
3224;Its about time we all woke up and recognized this film for the pure slice of heaven it is.
3225;Subtle story, delicate direction, unbelievable scenary, make us see that love is the matter, whoever may be.
3226;Why must Hollywood movies, be they romances or thrillers, have extremely handsome or beautiful actors in the lead roles?Brokeback Mountain is a good flick but it would have been more believable, and more aesthetically pleasing, if it had starred, say, Bryant Gumball and Robin Williams.
3227;Should have taken best picture hands down.
3228;A black and white movie which completely captivated me in the 1970's was The Last Picture Show.
3229;A film so outstanding it launched the careers of several actors.
3230;frankly I never thought a film of that genre could impress me again.
3231;Brokeback is Ang Lee's masterpiece in color.
3232;And it is beautiful in all of its theme of longing.
3233;keith Ledger is convincing as Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaul is splendid as Jack.
3234;And Randy Quaid deserves a bow, because he is even better than he was in the Last Picture Show or anything else he has ever done.
3235;Brokeback Mountain is an incredible movie about a forbidden romance that truly captivate the souls of the watchers.
3236;My whole family enjoyed it, though my husband seems quite surprised to see that I am not offended by the men going behind the wives' backs.
3237;Perhaps it is how director Ang Lee played his emotion magic again on its audience, or that I can understand the circumstances.
3238;But either way, the fact remains that this movie is probably the best movie I have ever seen.
3239;This is one of the year's best films, and it's more than a movie about gay cowboys.
3240;For us open minded people, this is one of the best love stories I have ever seen.
3241;This is a wonderful tragedy.
3242;This film should pick up a few Oscars, hopefully for the wonderful direction of Ang Lee.
3243;i fully understand and appreciate the messages and beauty of this film, albeit saddly, trying to wake people up from propaganda and prejudice, thinking that everyone is intelligent enough to appreciate this film.
3244;but the thing that perfected this movie for me was the acting.
3245;Heath ledger made a striking resemblence to his character throughout the entire film, leading me to capture all his acting highlights (something i RARELY do.)
3246;When I think breakthroughs I think rockets, always exceeding the expectation of mankind.
3247;moreover, I will even give the film this: absolutely stunning, vivid, amazing cinematography.
3248;so, in summary, the cinematography just enhances this film that was perfected through the incredible acting and about 30 minutes of extra footage that truly motivated you to take a stand for what is right.
3249;If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.
3250;Both men are great actors and use their faces and bodies to paint the range of emotions associated with the paradoxical pleasure and pain of love and attraction, with all its glorious moments and terrible imperfections.
3251;I love this country and the filmmaker respected its beauty and austerity.
3252;The film affords the thoughtful viewer reflective moments.
3253;I also loved the way the filmmakers made the connection between the touch and smell of physical artifacts as a token of a person who isn't present and very deeply missed.
3254;in addition to everything else it does well .
3255;serves as a memorial to his great talent.
3256;His portrayal of Ennis, a decent Wyoming ranchhand who settles into a dutiful dullness and only comes out of it into incandesence when his friend Jack comes around, is simply wonderful.
3257;Also painfully wonderful is Michelle William's performance as Ennis' wife, Alma, a good woman who for a time submits to a relationship that's less than what she'd hoped for.
3258;The lush guitar fills the film with an aural soundscape complementary to the visual.
3259;The orchestrated version of the main theme resonated with me in such a glorious and sad way, as though experiencing a orange and purple sunset one knows might be one's last.
3260;The movie theater was packed with all people both straight and gay.
3261;I liked this movie for what it is and what it stands for.
3262;I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see pure strength and a fearlessness for who they love.
3263;This is story telling at its best.
3264;I give my heartfelt thanks to the entire cast, crew, writers, producers and director for making such a sublimely beautiful story.
3265;But ignorance is alive and well in the good ol' USA guaranteeing many more years of tragic stories like this one for the unfortunate souls deemed unworthy of the righteous right.
3266;Brokeback Mountain, though not intended, is a testament to human ignorance and intolerance!
3267;This movie is a timely and important film to be seen by all.
3268;My friends kept telling me how amazing it was, how beautiful, and how achingly real.
3269;My boyfriend and I headed into the theatre excited and ready to be amazed.
3270;Half the audience applauded once the film was over.
3271;i'll give Brokeback Mountain one praise, and that is for its amazing and talented cast.
3272;Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger are quite good, and Michelle Williams is terrific.
3273;suffering wife might be a clich , but she is the most fleshed out, and most real character in the film.
3274;SPOILER ALERTBrokeback Mountain is one of the most affecting, beautiful movies I've ever seen.
3275;It's beyond Western, it's beyond romance, it's beyond gay cinema, although it has elements of all of these things.
3276;Every aesthetic and technical detail is superb, making the elegiac pace not just bearable but enjoyable.
3277;Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do fine work as Ennis and Jack's wives respectively.
3278;town America in the early 1960s.
3279;It's strongly hinted that Jack is killed because he dares to follow his true nature.
3280;Whatever Ennis's clinical sexual orientation may be, Jack is the love of Ennis's life, as we see from the exquisite scene at the end of the movie where Ennis, in his lonely trailer, cries over his and the now.
3281;Brokeback Mountain is that rare treasure of a movie that engages you emotionally, makes you think, and is at the artistic pinnacle of the filmmakers' art and craft.
3282;But it's really about forbidden love and being something you are not allowed to be on pain of death.
3283;A brilliantly acted, sensitively directed, gorgeously filmed tragedy.
3284;And what is even surprising to me is.
3285;You carry that flame for 4 years and once you see one another again.
3286;the flame becomes a fire that consumes both of you with passion, desire, and love?
3287;This movie, shows how beautiful love can be.
3288;and also how heartbreaking it really is.
3289;see it even if you don't LIKE that kind of movie.
3290;All you do see is a few bums and that is all.
3291;you have to grasp it and hold onto it.
3292;Annie Proux's short story is magnificently reproduced on the screen with Ang Lee's amazing cinematography.
3293;Most people have heard of this film, but those who have seen it can speak for the raw imagery and gut.
3294;wrenching story of love that cannot be fulfilled.
3295;hands getting a job together and eventually finding themselves in love with each other.
3296;the brilliant opening scene has you riveted right away.
3297;It takes ages for anyone to say anything, and when the first full sentence is spoken it is by neither of the boys, but by the man they are seeking a job from.
3298;If you do, the characters will speak to you in an unprecedented way, and you'll even find an occasional tongue in cheek joke adding some comic relief to this tragic story (e. g., Jack driving a tractor of the 'Versatile' brand).
3299;In this context, the few emotional and aggressive outbursts of course pack a tremendous punch.
3300;and then there is the sheer beauty of the images.
3301;Prieto's cinematography is simply breathtaking, and a random collection of frames from this film would make a great photobook.
3302;the lead actors carry the movie, and take the skill of acting to new heights.
3303;It is, however, Ledger's performance that is the big surprise and the crowning glory of this film.
3304;up spring, the tremendous tension inside palpable throughout.
3305;Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also give sterling performances as the tormented wives.
3306;Alma's Thanksgiving outburst and even more Lureen's telephone conversation with Ennis are acting feats of rare power .
3307;Roberta Maxwell appears only briefly as Jack's mother, yet projects so much intensity into her few lines and all her facial expressions that you feel you could write a novel about the woman.
3308;hollywood has come a long way in finally admitting a film like this to the mainstream.
3309;refusing to even view it, thus further devaluating the meaning of the Oscar system.
3310;in all, this is one of the most consistently beautiful, meaningful, and emotionally draining films I've seen in a long time .
3311;ang Lee's eye for panoramic beauty is untouched by any other director.
3312;When it's right and real you go through all kinds of trials and tribulations to keep it I was impressed and watch this at least once a week!!
3313;Brokeback Mountain is a very moving love story.
3314;It shows that love is love, no matter the gender, age or any other defining characteristic of lovers.
3315;It shows the many sides and emotions involved in a love relationships between 2 men, as well as the young ladies they end up marrying and how it effects all the people involved.
3316;It was a good movie.
3317;And I'm very glad Crash beat it for Best Picture.
3318;Even today, a great number of homosexual persons marry someone of the opposite sex.
3319;stained shirts, which left to Jack after the fightthough the storyline is kinda old style (a love story without good ending due to traditional stress), kudos to Ang Lee made it so unique, even though it's homosexuality
3320;Now thats History!Congratulations Ang Lee and the actors for being daring, unafraid and courageous enough to go to the limit with your talents.
3321;my wife and I loved this movie and we were pleased to bring our kids too.
3322;Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest films ever to come out of Hollywood in recent memory.
3323;From it's brilliant cinematography, to great acting and fantastic score, every detail of this movie is of the highest order.
3324;this beautiful and haunting love story between two poor under educated sheephearders will leave you moved for days on end.
3325;mr Gyllenhaal and Mr Ledger both demonstrated towering performances, especially Mr Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist was played with such brilliance that my heart bled for him.
3326;The wives played by Miss Williams and Miss Faris was also of excellence.
3327;Ang Lee is simply one of the finest directors gracing the planet today.
3328;The man is pure genius.
3329;Brokeback Mountain clearly shows how, by limiting love just between a man and a women, instead of allowing love between two humans, no matter what their gender, leaves deep wounds to all involved and with distructive lifetime effects.
3330;Love between two men is always ripe for a good laugh.
3331;It is quiet and it is beautiful.
3332;What makes the sparks fly with one person and not another?
3333;What makes one encounter a one night stand and another the love of a lifetime?
3334;i think this movie is destined to be a classic.
3335;It has so many subtle interactions and small, textural details woven in that more than one viewing is needed just to appreciate them all.
3336;this is a love story and once the tent scene is over with, you find you are also over any preconcieved ideas about it being a love story between two men.
3337;From that point on, you see two people who are destined for heartbreak.
3338;They try to do what they believe is right and honorable and each goes on to marry and have a family.
3339;For 4 years they try to put their one summer of love behind them (no puns intended) but when they finally meet again, their barriers are shattered and they face the true meaning of their relationship.
3340;they give most of themselves to their traditional lifestyles and the expectations of society but their love for each other is enduring and can't be denied.
3341;The acting is incredible and the entire cast and crew have turned out a work of art with what could easily have gone astray as the manifestation of the old joke about cowboys and sheep camps.
3342;the dynamics of the main characters are so real that I found myself associating their lifestyles and personalities to people I've known .
3343;the high country scenery is breathtaking and it, too, is real.
3344;They're human beings, with human emotions and actions and both virtues and vices in their everyday lives.
3345;They are good men and they are real men, both are portayed as loving husbands and fathers.
3346;Their relationship is very masculine and their affection is portrayed in a very masculine way.
3347;There are just a few moments of levity, and they're appreciated.
3348;As just about everyone who saw this will tell you, it's visually stunning.
3349;The gorgeous, rugged terrain made me want to pick up and move to Wyoming.
3350;This is the tale of a love that should never have occurred.
3351;I love the story, the picture, but the best thing is that i can see a real life situation, where it shows what is.
3352;who can deny that this is a great performance??
3353;Heath Ledger was an incredible talent
3354;gay or straight, after all, they were in love
3355;Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done.
3356;i quite liked both Jake and Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing.
3357;Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows.
3358;Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.
3359;the ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable.
3360;If you've known love, you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings.
3361;Brokeback Mountain was a terrific movie.
3362;One of the best I've seen in a long time.
3363;The love story of Jack and Ennis, two cowboys that fall in love with each other while working on brokeback mountain.
3364;all the performences are great, Gyllenhaal gives his best performence since the Good Girl while Hathaway comes far since her Princess diaries days.
3365;but the two standout performces are Ledger and Williams.
3366;Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek.
3367;i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt.
3368;some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it.
3369;it is truley the best film of the year.
3370;It's been more than one week since I first watched it and I just can't get it off my mind.Yes, like some people said it's a gay cowboy love story
3371;Under the directing of Ang Lee actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal put their whole feelings and minds into these charaters to create unforgetable images of two people in love.
3372;No other movie moved my so much.
3373;Brokeback Mountain is so refreshing and unique no wonder it has received so many rewards and tons of rave reviews.
3374;but after all, as the director Ang Lee pointed out, it is simple about love.
3375;a movie showing how strong love can be and how it can last forever.
3376;This will be short and sweet.
3377;This movie is by far the best film I think I have ever seen.
3378;I am so happy that someone made a true to life story about gay love.
3379;I am also happy that there was not one swish or lisp in the whole film.
3380;I recommend this film to everyone.
3381;To me, that's what makes this such an engaging breath of fresh air!
3382;Quite simply, this movie is beautiful, all the way from the miraculous acting, to the directing, to the cinematography to the gorgeous score music.
3383;It all weaves in and out of each other bringing together a genuinely original movie experience which is SO rare in the theater these days.
3384;Brokeback Mountain is so deeply emotional that anyone who has ever had their heart broken will be fighting off ghosts for quite some time.
3385;One of the truly great American films has been made by a Chinese director, an Argentinian composer, and an Australian lead actor.
3386;There may be a few tiny false notes, mostly in plot devices fleshing out the short story, but Mr. Lee has created an intimate, genuine, masterful, epic film which portrays a region, time, and two star.
3387;the film follows their passionate, private, and devoted friendship for 20 years.
3388;Jake Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as rodeo cowboy Jack Twist, who begins as a sweet, soft.
3389;spoken, sensuous young man, and grows into a loving, self.
3390;assured man who knows what he wants.
3391;the musical score is gorgeous, and perfectly complements the magnificent photography and scenery.
3392;Be sure to watch the credits, because Rufus Wainright's beautifully simple accompanying song sums up the entire film with remarkable sentiment and heartfelt aplomb.
3393;It's the real world, so let's accept the subject matter.
3394;Great acting, scenery and directing.
3395;This was my first time seeing the movie and I found that it did not live up to the hype.
3396;It often times scares you, surprises you, shakes you down to your very core.
3397;They fall in love: a love that they soon realize only lives and breathes on the mountain.
3398;it's 1963, pre American involvement in the Vietnam War, post Korean War: a time in the USA when life was simple, straightforward and the lines between the sexes and sex roles were crisply drawn and severely delineated.
3399;and so begins a Love affair that transcends social mores, time, marriages, children, extra.
3400;ignite their emotional and physical attraction: there is no one around, they are free from their regular lives.
3401;much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis and he gives what is without a doubt one of the finest performances of this year.
3402;As he showed us first in Monster's Ball, Ledger is capable of digging way deep down into his gut and imbuing his performances with an unflinching frankness and truth that we can neither ignore nor help to be moved by.
3403;gyllenhall's Jack is the younger of the two: he's fun, he's a little crazy and unfortunately he wants a lot, lot more than Ennis is able to give him.
3404;dog, frisky puppy of a performance is full of warmth and light: the kind of transcendent light that shines out from a soul full of love, understanding and acceptance.
3405;Ennis' wife Alma Del Mar is played by the wonderful Michelle Williams (The Baxter, Dawson's Creek).
3406;Jack gets in contact with Ennis and the two of them spend time fishing which is what they do but also their love for each other grows.
3407;Alma right away discovers the secret hiding and bottling it up inside of her all throughout.
3408;I ignore the bad reviews and snippy remarks and the jokes and just watch the movie and I thought it was pretty good for what it is.
3409;Is beautiful cinematography enough to make a movie?
3410;i thought Heath Ledger was very good in the movie and I think he deserved the Oscar nomination.
3411;brokeback Mountain wasn't a bad movie, but it also wasn't a very good movie, or a movie that made a lot of sense and I think most of the attention it received was because of hype.
3412;i understand how the movie won the Oscar for best screenplay from previously published material since the writers had to take a 20 minute short story and convert it into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie.
3413;i recommend Brokeback Mountain only to someone interested in seeing beautiful cinematography.
3414;This is a great love story if you can get over the gay part.
3415;the love and friendship is heart breaking.
3416;The storyline was intriguing and compelling throughout.
3417;The acting was superb as was the beautiful Canadian mountains and streams.
3418;The movie has a great message and crushes a lot of the typical thoughts about gay people.
3419;So many others have done that pretty well here.
3420;I'll just say that the film captures the loneliness of Wyoming perfectly then perfectly transposes it to the lives of the characters.
3421;I am struck by how much more I was moved by this film on the big screen.
3422;It's a study in love and courage, relationships, expectations, and society.
3423;Though this is not a happy film, there are moments of overwhelming and intense joy that carry you through the sadness and melancholy and make the journey worthwhile.
3424;Probably the most satisfying explanations are found in one's own heart.
3425;Hats off to director Ang Lee, screen writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, a brilliant ensemble cast and the superb technical crew that contributed to the making of one of the greatest American films of the past quarter century.
3426;The amount of detritus picked as Best Picture in Oscar's past is truly staggering, so in a way Brokeback Mountain has received a backhanded compliment from The Academy.
3427;The film joins an impressive list of magnficant losers: The Grapes Of Wrath, Citizen Kane, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, A Place In The Sun, High Noon, Giant.
3428;Brokeback Mountain' did manage to win three well deserved Oscars.
3429;Ang Lee's direction is brilliant, bringing alive a 20 year saga with the resonance of an epic novel.
3430;McMurty and Ossana's adaptation of Annie Proulx's eloquent short story is a model of craft, enriching the original tale with embellishments to characters and plot only hinted at in the source material.
3431;Gustavo Santaollala's original music score adds further power to the proceedings with plaintive themes and melodies evoking love and loss in the big wide open spaces.
3432;Good Night, and Good Luck and Munich were superb films.
3433;Adding to its luster is Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis, which will go into the history books as one of the most affecting pieces of acting ever put on the screen.
3434;I think Brokeback Mountain has been transformed into something well beyond a movie.
3435;So much material has been added and embellished concerning the two men's marriages and wives that their relationship with each other becomes background.
3436;In some ways I felt we learned more about the wives than the cowboys in this film.
3437;when Ang Lee succeeds he does so greatly.
3438;The entire early part is excellent.
3439;ups, longing eyes and trembling lips.
3440;Its very real and natural, told in subtle posing, stolen glances, gradual opening up and fear of making that first move.
3441;After that first move has been made Ennis and Jack seem completely natural and comfortable with each other.
3442;Jump ahead to the end, and it once again finds its heart.
3443;aged Jack bitterly confronting Ennis with all the what ifs and we should haves that their lives have come down to is very effective and sets up the sad and dismal end very well.
3444;Its a very raw and honest finish.
3445;The approach makes it very universal.
3446;He completely disappears in this role and the effect is amazing.
3447;Jake Gyllenhaal is also excellent.
3448;Randy Quaid is great in his small role and while he illustrates bigotry and contempt perfectly he never turns into a cartoon.
3449;She is a study in heartbreak and hidden understanding.
3450;It's funny to me that on the cusp of the year 2006, there are those who still feel the need to water down the point of this movie in order to make it more palatable to the general movie.
3451;The making and the success of this movie, in my opinion, is one of the milestones on that road.
3452;gay person out there has the lightbulb moment that we love and lose and love again just like everyone else, it will serve more than as just a greaet cinematic experience but one that opens the eyes and the hearts of others.
3453;cool movie and a good movie to hang out and drink beer with the gang.
3454;This is the first time they have met, and gradually a friendship forms between the two.
3455;The cast all do a good job, especially Ledger and Williams, who deserve the Oscar nominations they received.
3456;Pretty amazing considering the price of movie tickets.
3457;It is a good story, told well.
3458;My best friend lend me this movie yesterday.
3459;After all, 8 Academy awards got to count for something.
3460;A friend of my best friend is gay, and somehow, I immediately identify Jack as this friend.
3461;Watch this movie with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.
3462;Brokeback Mountain is the most intense love story I have seen in a long time!!!
3463;it's a one of a kind movie that made me realize love is so real or so powerful.
3464;I'll compare it with another Western I saw this year .
3465;this film is beautifully shot.
3466;You'll enjoy the scenery of the mountain locations, and Ang Lee even makes Texas attractive.
3467;the story and setting is also very true to mid.20th.
3468;laced religion and rebellion from it, and all the soul.
3469;And it's very 'white' .
3470;Having lived through a similar upbringing it all rang uncomfortably true.
3471;Watch the look on one wife's face as she realizes the truth.
3472;The director does a very good job of detailing this tragedy.
3473;This film tells about a beautiful tragedy of painful love.
3474;So I prefered Europian or Asian films for serious love story.
3475;For me, it was the scene impress me the most during reading the story.
3476;And it was good starting at the first meeting Ennis and Jack while the original story starts with Ennis's suffering life after Jack's death.
3477;i recomend you to read the original story that help you to feel more power of Brokeback Mountain than just seeing the movies.
3478;That is pretty much what I got.
3479;There is nothing uplifting about seeing 2 men in love, or lust, or whatever you call it, lieing to themselves and the people around them to no end other than to make life miserable for everyone involved.
3480;Not only does this movie combined a emotionally moving script and world renowned conducting, but the actors and actresses also stayed true to the characters.
3481;You literally feel the boundaries between you and the story, and the actors and their characters shatter, placing you in a new reality
3482;Nevertheless, this movie will remain in history for years to come, and it is my hope that every person living today at least have one copy of this amazing movie in their movie collection.
3483;This is a wonderful film, with only a single major flaw.
3484;The direction is really remarkable .
3485;His direction make's Heath Ledger's rather stoic performance almost magical, and gives Jake G.'s histrionics the right tone.
3486;crossed lovers struggle with their love in an immensely moving story.
3487;So, we have a tender, beautiful and subtle film filled with moving performances, astonishing direction, exquisite photography and understated elegance turned, in one five.
3488;More important to the movie is the emotional journey the characters make as the film progresses.
3489;Important to me was seeing how the characters handled the love scenes, especially with Gyllenhaal's concern that the scenes be authentic.
3490;With Twist being the one more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve, I was especially keen to see how Gyllenhaal portrayed Twist's love for Del Mar.
3491;From the deep feeling of love Twist felt for Del Mar in one sex scene to the bitter I just don't know how to quit you later in the movie, the viewer can feel those emotions along with Gyllenhaal, along with the wistful, sunny optimism that sometimes gets in the way of pragmatism forced on him by society.
3492;I'm gay, and certainly herald this unconventional love story.
3493;I love Annie Proulx's original story of Brokeback Mountain more than any other piece of contemporary literature, and I wanted to love Ang Lee's film as much as I love the story.
3494;I do like the film a lot, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal embody Ennis and Jack magnificently
3495;Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana write wonderful dialogue, and McMurtry unquestionably knows more about how cowboys act, talk and think than any other living author, with the possible exception of Proulx.
3496;interesting new characters, and make some slight but annoying changes to the original that dilute its impact.
3497;(Their screenplay is indeed beautiful and tear.
3498;As for Lee's direction, he obviously is a masterful director of actors
3499;Lee also captures some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of the Rockies and Great Plains with the help of his superb photographer, Rodrigo Prieto.
3500;Ledger is particularly impressive as an archetypal cowboy.
3501;who finds himself drawn into a love that everything in his previous experience tells him is a death sentence.
3502;dog eyes and lopsided grin, makes us feel his character's ardent emotional needs with touching immediacy.
3503;I just wish the film as a whole was as great as they are.
3504;I love the moive and will watch it over and over again.
3505;spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first.
3506;In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life.
3507;the years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families.
3508;Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway.
3509;It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship
3510;Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters.
3511;Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers
3512;This is an even more profound lesson than the need to accept homosexuality.
3513;This is one of the most beautiful and heart.
3514;breaking love stories I have ever watched.
3515;really touching and not to be missed.
3516;I, a Brokeback Mountain lover, have a right to suspect that Oscar examiners are unfair when they award Crash Best Motion Picture of 2005.
3517;this movie touches my heart a lot.
3518;It absolutely deserves to win the Best Motion Picture of 2005.
3519;i hope Director's cut edition of this movie will be soon produced.
3520;Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair.
3521;It's an epic love story genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions.
3522;Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused.
3523;Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else.
3524;The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles.
3525;On Being a Cowboy (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope.
3526;Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee.
3527;Captions are available for the film in English, subtitles in Spanish and French, dubbing in French.
3528;I just saw this movie and I thought it was well put together.
3529;The guys are totally amazing and played really good roles.
3530;Glad I waited til cable got hold of it .
3531;the directing was really good as well.
3532;the film was hit&Miss in terms of pacing&also the story lines hit on some cliches,but the film was interesting.
3533;A tale of love that happens to be about two men who battle with their guilt in being gay and facing the repercussions of an intolerant society.
3534;Script adaption was very popular and floated around Hollywood for several years until someone was brave enough to touch it and turn it into a film.
3535;worth a look but I feel CAPOTE and CRASH were better.
3536;Very tastefully done for the most part.
3537;A sad and compelling story that can be revisited time after time.
3538;Along with Walk the Line and Constant Gardner, this movie tops my best.
3539;It is a poignant love story sans the melodrama or political heavy.
3540;handedness often present in gay/lesbian.
3541;Ang Lee is such a deft filmmaker that I forgot I was watching a quote.
3542;rate: the script adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story is flawless and natural
3543;life couple Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger in their portrayal of their characters' ill.
3544;fated marriage)
3545;The musical score, like the film itself, is nuanced, subtle, and emotionally.
3546;charged in a quiet way without being over.
3547;But if you have ever done anything that you thought could produce your death were it to be known and the combination of angst and anxiety that it brings despite the joy Ennis and Jack shared, then this movie does it well.
3548;i thought Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for his performance because he brought so much depth to the role.
3549;And for these two straight guys to feign this passion so realistically really shows how great they are as actors.
3550;But for movie buffs, a watersched movie, for gay.
3551;This movie deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Film.
3552;this is both a Great Love Story and arguably the best Gay Film to date, one of that rare breed: A film that actually lives up to all the hype (and endless parodies) surrounding it.
3553;Natural beauty of America varies between states, and Wyoming is really scenic for its mountains covered with forests, pristine grass and rivers originating at.
3554;broad willingness to watch this film and public preparedness to assume and freely discuss an issue in the most parts of a world are the best winners by themselves.
3555;This fullscreen version is really nice for some of the more intimate segments in this movie, where the sweeping vistas aren't the main thing of interest.
3556;Highly recommend that you have both versions, if you're a Brokeaholic.
3557;Director Ang Lee pulls off one hell of a love story that transcends sexuality.
3558;Both leave the mountain, and eventually continue on with their lives the way society has told them to.
3559;Jack eventually finds the bravery to push for what he wants, but Ennis, closed.
3560;both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are emotional knockouts and the actors who beat them for the Oscars had better have given superhuman efforts to best them.
3561;Credit director Ang Lee for obsessively scanning the small things that make a good actor great, and a good movie a classic.
3562;A movie about gay cowboys it may be, but it's the humanity and love between Ennis and Jack that make Brokeback Mountain universal.
3563;The intimate scenes are tastefully filmed and poignant.
3564;They become friends and suddenly much more.
3565;While both men go on to try and live the conventional married with children lifestyle with women, meeting up with each other again four years later only proves to each other that theirs, is the real love.
3566;All of this is done with stellar performances by Ledger and Gyllenhall, who can say more with a look than any words might convey.
3567;The cinematography is so good as to give this movie an epic feel.
3568;The bottom line is, love is love.
3569;One walks away from this movie profoundly moved.
3570;An interesting little twist near the end shows Ennis viewing the contents of Jack's closet.
3571;This is when love and heartbreak transcends any type of sexual orientation to become the language we all know and speak.
3572;A must see movie, maybe twice!
3573;ennis is a closed up person Jack is fun and outgoing.
3574;so every year they steal a few days here and there at Brokeback mountain.
3575;a straight  life with a wife and children and Jack on the side whenever he could spare the time.
3576;Don't get me wrong it is a beatiful movie with beatiful scenery and wonderful acting from the entire cast .
3577;Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel.
3578;Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's.
3579;His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards.
3580;Although these are strong words, they are true.
3581;Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great.
3582;Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain.
3583;Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes.
3584;For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.
3585;His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess.
3586;michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch.
3587;She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it.
3588;Thank You with the dearest of appreciation.
3589;going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie.
3590;But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie.
3591;It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way.
3592;I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt.
3593;This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come.
3594;The film received Golden Globes for best director, screenplay, and drama film (just to name a few of many awards recieved in other conventions).
3595;It is no wonder Ang Lee's adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's story Brokeback Mountain is a triumph and a beautiful one at that.
3596;Two hetrogenically separate characters, that ironically mixes with such grace and beauty.
3597;Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also presented an amazing roll as the two guys' wives.
3598;It touched on such a sensitive and controversial story about the loneliness of homosexuality in society of Wyoming, 1963.
3599;But fundamentally, it was more than a gay cowboy film
3600;It's an extremely beautiful and poignant film with stunning cinematography that captures the audience in a deep, deep place within.
3601;I'm still speechless to this day.
3602;the beautiful score by Argentina.
3603;He provided the film with a true breathtaking western score of crisp and melancholy sounds from violins, banjos, acoustic guitars and other westerly influenced instruments.
3604;The soundtrack also includes heartfelt music by Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Teddy Thompson, Mary McBride, Rufus Wainwright (who appeared on Antony and the Johnson's stunning album, I Am a Bird Now) and many others.
3605;I think it's honest and true.
3606;This movie shows and captures a love relationship that hides nothing, and I have total respect for that.
3607;The story, the acting was all so solid.
3608;Thus, potentially making it my favourite film of the 20 years I've been on this earth.
3609;Honest to god, it was that good.
3610;I have never ever been so moved in my entire life.
3611;All I can say is wow.
3612;Even though I don't agree that we're all compromising and accepting, it is very gutsy and brave of Ang Lee to bring this to the big screen
3613;The most touching part about this film is that even though it's a period film, it is still relatable and put into context gay or straight.
3614;what a incredible multilayered story with such a superb crew.
3615;Its truthful perception of a same.
3616;Brokeback Mountain truly proves to be an epic, and should never be forgotten
3617;What a truly stunning film, this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry, more of these should see the light !
3618;but all its got is a new DTS track and just 2 new featurettes, including A groundbreaking success (which I'm sure, as the title suggests, is nothing more than the people involved, appreciating each other), Music from the mountains (obviously only about the music) and an art gallery of still images!!
3619;deserved best film 2005 but Hollywood are cowards
3620;Really beautiful Movie that will make you forget the time, bring up your tears , break your heart, and teach you something.
3621;It's really worth seeing Movie
3622;In my opinion, it was created for the big screen, theater.
3623;Although being about two gay men, this film is definitely not only for gay people.
3624;As any great film should be considered.
3625;Delicate, subtle, beautiful, poignant, cerebral, devastating and haunting, this film is a work of art.
3626;It achieves what a great work of art does: gets one thinking, elicits powerful emotions and heavy controversy.
3627;Annie Proulx's novella was translated into a superb screenplay that remains faithful to the story and keeps the spirit of its characters alive.
3628;Besides the astonishing performances of both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal (and the rest of the acting cast, no less), what makes this movie many cuts above a mere tearjerker is the masterful direction.
3629;Watch the camera work (great cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto), the subtle and symbolic use of detail and colors, the beautiful composition of so many images and the precise positioning of the characters in certain scenes, all doen in order to tell the viewer so much more than what is said by dialogue.
3630;The love scenes, oh, here we go: quietly expressive, powerful, intimate, sensual yet not graphic.
3631;There's a sense of privacy and emotional restraint about Ang Lee's direction that make these scenes so affecting.
3632;then there is the music, delicate, almost scarce, complementing the movie instead of overpowering it, and beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
3633;i believe it takes several viewings to be able to take this film in and fully appreciate it.
3634;This movie is so delicately expressive on so many levels that it permeates us, first emotionally, then on a more cerebral level.
3635;There are so many metaphors and symbols that abund and enrich it, making it a fulfilling experience, albeit quite devastating .
3636;the more we understand the beauty of this film, the deeper it cuts.
3637;It's a film that we don't view, we live, and it stays unyieldingly and unapologetically true to life until the end.
3638;i will give one extra star for the scenery though.
3639;A marvelous adaptation of the short story writer by Annie Proulx.
3640;This is what happens to people when life gives them the opportunity to explore, to desire, to remain true to their most inner needs, to become enslaved by their fears.
3641;This is what happens to people when they look back on their lives and rethink their existence, their choices, this is what happens when people have to live with their past.
3642;This goes full circle: awakening, discovering, identifying, and suffering what is at the very core of life itself.
3643;Prepare for this film to tie your heart in a knot.
3644;A marvelous adaptation of the short story writer by Annie Proulx.

3647;This goes full circle: awakening, discovering, identifying, and suffering what is at the very core of life itself.
3648;Prepare for this film to tie your heart in a knot.
3649;This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
3650;The performances by both lead actors were brilliant, better than I ever expected.
3651;Supporting role by Michelle Williams absolutely great.
3652;NOt only was the storyline great, the writing, the directing, the landscapes were breathtaking, they really took you to the life.
3653;I read the short story before watching the film Both are excellent and both stand on their own as original works of art.
3654;everyone knows all that has been said.
3655;Heath Ledger did an excellent job of internalizing his character's homophobia.
3656;Only those who have been there can truly appreciate the depth presented here.
3657;homophobia destroys not only the person who is homophobic but all those around them, family, friends, and as so brilliantly and vividly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, their lovers too.
3658;even after that, there was high political motivation for the film's R rating.
3659;jake Gyllenhaal did a much better job for an actor in a supporting role than did George Clooney in Syriana.
3660;Without hesitation, I replied: Yes, and it is one of the greatest romantic movies I have ever seen.
3661;during the course of watching this movie, I sat completely still.
3662;At some points, I grew so intrigued that I forgot how to breathe.
3663;A moment later, a wave of sadness swept over me like a blanket.
3664;Brokeback Mountain is one of the movies you can watch once, but always remember.
3665;I am a huge fan of the movies that bring out the emotions which are buried deep within, and this movie gets an A+ in that perspective.
3666;Hollywood has done the LGBT community a great favor with this one.
3667;Ever since I first watched it last week, I have shown it to quite a few people who also ended up loving it!
3668;I made an effort to see it last night because I wanted to see history being made with Brokeback winning best film.
3669;everyone knows that prior to the Oscars, Brokeback won every best picture award available, except one.
3670;There just comes a time when enough is enough.
3671;the academy had a chance to pick the best film, and send a very needed message.
3672;The film will do wonders anyhow, and as time goes on, Brokeback will be the one film remembered most for 2005.
3673;for those of us who love the beauty of this film, at least we'll always have that.
3674;Each telling their wives they are going away with a fishing buddy.
3675;I really recommend you see this film.
3676;It is just a beautiful film.
3677;So I decided to brace myself and try to enjoy it.
3678;It's going to make me enjoy my life and the things I have a little more than I did yesterday.
3679;Each telling their wives they are going away with a fishing buddy.
3680;I really recommend you see this film.
3681;It is just a beautiful film.
3682;So I decided to brace myself and try to enjoy it.
3683;It's going to make me enjoy my life and the things I have a little more than I did yesterday.
3684;Based on a story by a great author, great actors, a renowned director and great reviews should equal a great movie experience, but I'm conflicted.
3685;I feel much more sympathetic towards Ennis' wife.
3686;Watching Michelle Williams play her suffering through this reality for years is the true great performance in this movie.
3687;In the end, I felt Jack's love for Ennis more than the other way around.
3688;Despite my reservations over the authenticity of the love story, the movie is beautiful and there are great performances from the actors.
3689;I did find myself thinking about the movie for days afterward, which is a sign of a good movie to me.
3690;Simply said, this film will last.
3691;well, a few adjectives: it is spare.
3692;it is (so far) unique.
3693;The director, the actors and actressses, the writers.
3694;they allworked for relatively little money by Hollywood standards, and they managed tomake this staggeringly good film.
3695;com is exceeding 800 as of this writing.
3696;Some are critical reviews but most are expressions of emotion.
3697;What is more, it pushed me to write and share something about it.
3698;at first I thought movies simply means moving pictures.
3699;Without a need for a detailed explanation, it moves the audiences not only on the emotional level but also on the physical level.
3700;It proves to be a force that causes the people who have seen it to move.
3701;talk, write, share their experiences.
3702;so now I understand a deeper meaning of movies.
3703;The cast and crew of Brokeback Mountain produced a magnificent film about real life and love in all of its diversity.
3704;Yes, Heath Ledger's Ennis was deep and believable, but Jake Gyllenhal was magnificent as Jack Twist who was brave enough to want to follow his heart and say hell and be damned to the whole world.
3705;Like other positive reviewers, I can only offer thanks to Ang Lee, the producers, and the cast.
3706;Strengths include the obvious majesty of the landscapes and the cinematography that capture it.
3707;The characters are entirely credible and are given exquisite nuances by both the script and the actors.
3708;For better or for worse, I recognize and have experienced some of the conflicts and situations depicted in the film and have been overwhelmed by the emotional accuracy that the ensemble has been able to depict.
3709;can feel the admiration and deep love that is communicated between the two leads, both in their silence and in the consummately male banter.
3710;The early film brilliantly and efficiently captures the shift between Ennis and Jack from indifference, to trust, to the love the dared not express its name.
3711;Mapping that transformation is what the early film was about, and Lee did so brilliantly.
3712;But the love, sometimes exhilerating, sometimes crushing, was palpable and brilliantly portrayed.
3713;the rest of the film is right on target.
3714;all of this is well done.
3715;I suspect that viewers with ultra.
3716;Against this disclaimer, I will add that this movie has deeply affected me.
3717;By themselves, these more open communication and understanding make the film a godsend.
3718;The artistry of all involved take the film to another level.
3719;It is a true treasure.
3720;The story, acting, music,costunes, scenery/location . . . This movie brings back the art and power of cinema and how stories move us.
3721;Brokeback Mountain est un hymne a l'amour, sincere, entier.
3722;This movie began looking like a well made piece of cinema, excellent soundtrack, beautiful scenery, fine acting, especially the opening piece with Randy Quaid, no comedy in this part but played convincingly well.
3723;The acting was very good, I just didn't see any real charisma going on between the two main characters and everyone else just seemed to be thrown into the mix at will.
3724;Dare I say that I myself also found it not bad?
3725;Not bad is a reasonable assessment as far as I'm concerned.
3726;box rather than in a film.
3727;assessed purely as a film, Brokeback Mountain is quite good.
3728;Lovely photography, atmospheric in places.
3729;The acting is good but not great.
3730;The morality of tough guys subjected to romantic longing and unrequited love is touching.
3731;The ethics of the way these two subsequently treat their families is seedier.
3732;What we might call the orthodoxy of received fan wisdom is a barrier to fair judgement.
3733;This is also the case with Ledger, a good actor who is indulged in mumbling and so inhibited (presumably by the director) from delivering his best performance.
3734;the other lead is undeniably pretty, if that's what unholsters your pistol.
3735;children on their bedroom wall posters are great musicians.
3736;interest area of their own, well, that's fine.
3737;It is superb in all categories: acting, musical score and direction.
3738;A five star masterpiece that will live on forever.
3739;I got my mom to watch this and even she was impressed, and she can be very critical, especially when it comes to movies.
3740;There, they become friends .
3741;When their jobs come to an end, they go their separate ways, but neither are totally happy until, four year later, they meet up.
3742;It is about love, it is about accepting who you are (including your sexuality), it is about being true to yourself because, if you aren't, you will always be miserable.
3743;Its a moving testament of the power of love and of the human heart, you dont choose who you love, your heart makes the decision.
3744;I thought Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were brilliant.
3745;I love that, all they saw was a moving and powerful story of the human heart, and not just some gay movie.
3746;This is the best love story I have ever seen.
3747;Ang Lee has a knack for telling tragic love stories, and this is his best work.
3748;It is simply a Masterpeice and should win every award it is nominated for at the oscars.
3749;This is the kind of film that can help change the World.
3750;The only strikingly gay scenes in the movie are done with early on and they are done with sensitivity and grace.
3751;Featuring absolutely stunning cinematic scenery and incredibly subtle performances by the cast, this is a love story for the ages.
3752;Among the best movies of the last decade .
3753;Looks like from the store new, which is good.
3754;The shipping service was fast, so really really good.
3755;It doesn't line up with the usual box office hits, so I'm quite surprised that it has been as well received by the general public apart from the film critics.
3756;following the typical Ang Lee approach, Brokeback Mountain is an extended film that begins with a languid pace, tracking the relationship between Ennis and Jack that spans twenty years.
3757;It refrains from hammering a message into the viewers' head, but allows the story to unfold and speak for itself.
3758;Silently, the film reaches out and seeps under your skin, and before you know it, Brokeback Mountain has found the rawest part of your heart and pierce right through it.
3759;Brokeback Mountain is a heartbreaking love story made more tragic by the extra dimension of homosexuality.
3760;loath has petrified his ability to love.
3761;but Brokeback Mountain also offers hope and redemption in the finals scenes.
3762;stained shirts worked together as one is a powerful symbol of their love that cannot be denied.
3763;Jack's mother, who invites Ennis to visit Jack's room and discover the shirts, shows that she has known about their relationship and chooses to accept them despite the hateful hostility of her husband.
3764;The very last moments of the film, which I'll not reveal here, is simply genius.
3765;i encourage viewers to see the movie at least twice.
3766;One can better appreciate the many nuances and acting after you know how the story develops.
3767;For those who are willing to open themselves to Brokeback Mountain, it will tell you a beautiful love story that lingers with you as you leave the cinema.
3768;Perhaps it will inspire you to reconnect with your own heart and soul and become better people.
3769;I watched it with an open mind and found it to be a beautifully filmed, heart wrenching film.
3770;twist (played by the very handsome Jake Gyllenhaal) wants to start a life with his new friend but the reticent Del Mar (he mumbles as if he has marbles in his mouth.
3771;Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) had plans to marry and both men do marry and have families of their own but are never really happy.
3772;The only happiness the men have is the occasional times they return to their hidden companionship and love life on Brokeback Mountain.
3773;Another review used the word understated, and I think that is an excellent description of the film.
3774;the scenery of Brokeback Mountain is beautiful and the film does an excellent job aging the characters as the film progresses through 20 years.
3775;moving, it is interesting enough to hold one's attention throughout.
3776;It's one I want to own and refer to time and time again.
3777;i was pleased to see the theatre packed with a widely diverse audience, following no guidelines according to race, gender, or age.
3778;It is a testament to the film's universality.
3779;True, director Ang Lee won the coveted Best Director award that year that EVERYONE predicted he would win.
3780;Very well could have been.
3781;important and high on its ARSE and blows it!
3782;2006 was one of those years and instead awards the Best Picture to CRASH.
3783;In terms of the story packing an emotional punch, Brokeback is right up there with Million Dollar Baby in giving the audience an unforgettable movie.
3784;going experience, especially as the film marches to its shattering conclusion.
3785;As expected, Million Dollar won Best Picture Oscar the previous year for director/producer Clint Eastwood.
3786;movie critic Roger Ebert predicted in the final weeks of Oscar voting that Crash would win Best Picture based on his observations and conversations with members of the motion picture academy.
3787;Once in a while Hollywood really gets it right and awards the best films and actors with a deserving Oscar.
3788;this is a perfect example of how individuals weigh the importance of social acceptance with the overwhelming power of love.
3789;The realistic display of these characters stumbling through their lives, unsure of which path to choose, gives everyone who sees the film a glimpse of what it's like to conceal their real selves from loved ones and society at large.
3790;ang Lee did an amazing job sculpting so much pain into a work of art.
3791;A true love story for the ages.
3792;Lee definitely took the words on paper and brought them to the big screen.
3793;Needless to say, I was very impressed.
3794;The principle thing that stands out in my mind is Ang Lee's ability to convey so eloquently the conflicting love that these two men feel towards one another.
3795;more than anything you feel the resistance of the characters at every turn.
3796;This is what true love should really feel like, and it shows.
3797;This movie is a perfect example of this.
3798;The message is what is important, no matter how you obtain it.
3799;The love scenes and love relationship in general feels more like a fetish reenactment or a spare the moment I haven't gotten any for a long time kind of thing.
3800;The love never really hits a believable level where you're like yeah, they really care for each other even without the sex.
3801;I guess that's how it works in real life but again it goes back to the pretty static plot.
3802;Many motion pictures have portrayed gay men and women in a positive light.
3803;In fact, television had a one up on Ang Lee's masterpiece when Will and Grace was aired.
3804;a beautiful love story, a tragic, grief.
3805;I know from personal experience that you DON'T choose whom you love, and love IS a force of nature.
3806;shattering consequences as the ones so poignently depicted by these two incredibly talented young actors.
3807;Absolutely amazing!This movie hit me like a shot to the heart.
3808;it's a beautiful story about deep and genuine love, denied by society.
3809;Brokeback Mountain made me think about my own life, about the force of genuine feelings: those who are lucky enough to find true love in this .
3810;life should keep it like a treasure because this is ultimately what it counts.
3811;I found his character deeply moving and absolutely realistic.
3812;this is Ang Lee's best film by far, and one the best movies I have ever seen
3813;i can't get out of my head its intense images, the laconic, unforgettable lines, its haunting music.
3814;what makes this movie great is its perfect mixture of strong and poetic images (it's hard to believe they gave the Oscar for best cinematography to Memoirs of a Geisha!)
3815;the actors' performances are absolutely stunning: Heath Ledger is in my opinion the best of all, and it's a real shame he didn't get the awards he deserved!
3816;His astounding portrayal of Ennis does smack of loneliness and alienation.
3817;I just watched Brokeback Mountain, I liked it but I dont think I loved it.
3818;Maybe alittle more emotion, tenderness, or connecting with the viewer.
3819;One of my closet friends who is homosexual really liked it.
3820;the film brings to the story vivid images of the magnificent landscape of Brokeback Mountain and the development of the characters present them as I envisioned them reading the short story.
3821;the film brings to the story vivid images of the magnificent landscape of Brokeback Mountain and the development of the characters present them as I envisioned them reading the short story.
3822;Brokeback Mountain was the most nominated film this year in the Academy Awards with eight nominations, including the coveted categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Director.
3823;The New York Times gives it a remarkable grade of 100%, leaving some of the year's other top films, such as Capote behind at 90%.
3824;The film is a personal story of two brave young men, Ennis Del Mar, a ranch hand played brilliantly by Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stellar performance as Jack Twist, a rodeo Texan cowboy.
3825;The two men keep their secretive relationship ongoing for a twenty year period and the actors do very well in aging their characters, whether it is through the use of makeup, growing facial hair or deepening the voices and strengthening their accents.
3826;The movie's cliff hanger ending and soaring musical score is bound to haunt and puzzle viewers for a long time to come, with a bone.
3827;Overall, Heath Ledger delivers one of the best performances in the history of modern cinema as Ennis Del Mar
3828;Brokeback Mountain is an epic movie that really tugs at the heartstrings filled with drama, adventure, passion, sorrow, mystery, suspense, concealment, resentment, heartbreak, hardship, betrayal with a presence of several elements of humor and wit.
3829;The acting performances by the cast members are all superb, done with maximum soul on their part.
3830;The movie lives up to its theme that love is nothing but a force of nature.
3831;I was blown away and found it to be one of the most powerful, touching and melancholic movies I have ever seen in my life.
3832;One cold night, the two men huddle together in a tent to keep warm, and an explosive physical relationship erupts.
3833;shot deal, but somehow the two men keep finding one another again, throughout the summer.
3834;year relationship that is by turns passionate, furtive, and tortured.
3835;totally transforms himself for this role.
3836;baked, and shamed, his Ennis provides the tension in the film that powers the plot through to its final, saddening conclusion.
3837;Gyllenhaal plays Jack, the more honest, self.
3838;accepting of the two men, with an emotion that is strong enough to be real but restrained enough to epitomize the tough guy image of a Western.
3839;at the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, the tale of two people who love each other but can't be together.
3840;proves to be very powerful.
3841;The intensity of the two men's feelings for one another, and the delayed gratification that is the bedrock of their relationship, bring their experience into sharp focus for the viewer.
3842;Beautiful scenes of mountainous countryside and a strong, simple acoustic guitar accompaniment add to the poignancy.
3843;I'll be 100% honest here and say I hate love stories.
3844;I've enjoyed a select few, like The Notebook and Titanic, but never got into most others.
3845;I finally had the chance to sit down and watch it the other day and it was honest to God, AMAZING.
3846;The story was so realistic and heartwrenching.
3847;You actually can FEEL their emotions, both happy and sad.
3848;It's one of the best love stories of all time and also one of the saddest.
3849;Every minute of this movie is worth watching and I wish more movies could be so intense and amazing.
3850;This movie is a masterclass and everyone should have the chance to see it.
3851;I've never been homophobic, but if I was and saw this movie, I'd have a whole new respect for homosexuals.
3852;This movie helps you understand that love is love, no matter who anybody is with.
3853;Heath Ledger's performance was a revelation.
3854;Brokeback Mountain is a great film that will stay with you days after you've seen it.
3855;It is a beautifully made and acted film with a story worth telling which is nice to see since that has become a Hollywood rarity.
3856;This is a movie that one should definatly give a chance, it is well worth your time.
3857;Both leads are very impressive escpecially Heath Ledger in what is indeed a career making performance.
3858;The story draws the heart and mind into full involvement.
3859;Daring, fresh, and worthy of every bit of praise it receives.
3860;wrenching feelings in my heart.
3861;It's brought forth the lost loves in my life.
3862;Every emotion I've ever felt has been SLAMMED back into my heart and soul.
3863;Heath Ledger has accomplished, in this movie, what no one ever has before.
3864;He was all my loves.
3865;Loving, caring, open, honest, wanting but not 'getting'.
3866;It will sit in my heart forever.
3867;It is awesome and the acting and directing is beautifully orchestrated.
3868;Its everything a movie should be.
3869;If you are afraid to see this movie you really should give it a chance.
3870;Its a well written story that puts you right there at the characters path.
3871;It also shows you how things were right here in America not long ago, with some things still holding strong today.
3872;Open your mind and watch it.
3873;Then open your heart and understand it.
3874;While it started off a little slow, it grew into a beautiful narrative about love, life, regret and grief.
3875;jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) and Heath Ledger (Ennis) give masterful performances, opening themselves up emotionally, so completely you can't help but believe their love for each other.
3876;At the end of the summer, each man returns to their previous life having sworn the summer was a one.
3877;While it may offend some people, you can easily fast.
3878;But this movie is so much bigger than that one scene, and I would highly recommend watching this movie even if you are a little uncomfortable with the idea of two men together .
3879;I have to say I loved this film for many reasons.
3880;The music score is haunting and excellent.
3881;There is a good reason Gustavo won the Oscar for his compositions.
3882;I am truly sorry he did not win Best Actor for his heart wrenching performance in this film.
3883;Lee's Direction is inspired and the cinematography breathtaking.
3884;for those who would condemn this film, I ask that you give it a chance.
3885;Brokeback Mountain's themes are Universal and important.
3886;This film is a gift.
3887;I feel pity for those that would not open their eyes to the messages portrayed so beautifully in this film.
3888;I was so excited that it was expanding to my area, and I went to see it the first day of release.
3889;Brokeback Mountain is a delicate film, full of life and splendor.
3890;The cast and writers handled the subject matter with elegance and passion, and the simpler aspects of the film, cinematography, etc. were just as well handled.
3891;i was so pleased with the cast of Brokeback Mountain.
3892;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaall made the perfect couple .
3893;Their chemistry was beyond description, and their love scenes were realistic and sensual.
3894;I could constantly feel their pain and longing .
3895;Furthermore, the women were just as fascinating.
3896;Her phone conversation with Ennis is one of the most moving scenes in the entire film.
3897;ang, Heath, Jake, Michelle, and Anne's greatest achievement is their delicacy.
3898;I think Ebert said it best.
3899;Brokeback Mountain is a rare achievement in film making.
3900;Where the intention of the writers, along with the vision of the director and dedication of the actors marry into a wonderful and honest piece of work.
3901;The story is encompassing and quite remarkable in it's depth.
3902;The film is quite breathtaking to watch with it's open ranges and wide scope,balanced with claustrophobic alleys and tight rooms.
3903;The acting is stellar, and awe inspiring.
3904;This was an example of exactly what movies were always meant to be, an extraordinary story telling.
3905;If you are curious about this film at all, i recommend judging for yourself.
3906;wrenching affecting heart pounding love story.
3907;One that i think everyone should see.
3908;I know it's about time we had some movies in which the gay characters got a happy ending.
3909;So if you're looking for a movie about the triumph of gay true love.
3910;But if you have a serious love for well.
3911;made movies with excellent acting, sharp writing, intelligent and graceful directing, awesome cinematography and a haunting score.
3912;Very glad that I did!
3913;I still prefer King Kong for Best Picture of 2005 but this is a close running second for me!
3914;They were both phenomenal in this movie.
3915;Plus, I was able to relate to this because this kind of thing does happen.
3916;And I speak from experience (minus the whole cowboy theme).
3917;He was absolutely brilliant in this film.
3918;The whole cast of this movie did a wonderful job and I hope that Heath does bring home the Oscar.
3919;Would have been neet to see them both win an Oscar on March 5th.
3920;well, Brokeback Mountain is a really great movie!
3921;Thank you to Ang Lee for putting it together so beautifully!
3922;I've watched this film 4 times now, and the curious thing is that each time I view it, it gets better.
3923;This film is a classic, a breakthrough.
3924;Everything about it is perfection.
3925;It is a perfect example of less is more.
3926;The acting is excellent, the cinematography, brilliant.
3927;In my thinking, it WAS the best picture of the year.
3928;This film will be one that is owned in collections of the best films of all times.
3929;It's in mine, and I hope that it will be in yours.
3930;This movie is amazing: the performances, the scenery (it's really Alberta, not Wyoming), the tragic love story, and the direction.
3931;Ang Lee NEEDS to get an Oscar for this movie.
3932;See it and experience the magic for yourself.
3933;Boy Oh Boy, what a joy.
3934;this was a stunning love affair, between two people, which moved from the physical and sexual side onto a higher and more meanigful plain in the end.
3935;i fell in love with Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar right from the start of this story and I can only take my hat off to the fine acting, wonderful script, and fantastic music.
3936;I just watched the Academy Awards and I feel like I have just been punched in the face.
3937;Brokeback Mountain is the most wonderful film that I have seen in years.
3938;Not only is the acting outstanding but the story is very true to life.
3939;This wonderful film lost to Crash?
3940;But at least with All in the Family you got a laugh.
3941;Tonights award show just proves that this type of show is just another political statement.
3942;If anyone wants to see a real moving movie with great acting please see Brokeback.
3943;At least you will get a laugh out of it.
3944;For such an intensely spare film, I would like to spend only the necessary words: Brokeback Mountain is a great virile love story, beautifully rugged and limpid, destined to become a classic.
3945;This movie is groundbreaking, beautiful and incredibly haunting.
3946;I can't get this movie out of my head for an entire week after I saw this movie, and I was moved and touched so profoundly and deeply.
3947;the acting of this movie was fabulous, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams both did a great job, and Heath Ledger, all I can say is WOW!
3948;His magnificent performance is miraculous.
3949;He seems to tear it from his insides, and he breathes his character so truthfully and brilliantly.
3950;His performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting.
3951;Bravo!Another strength of this movie is the simplicity and strong symbolism of the way the story is told.
3952;telling is so genuine, like the characters' feelings for one another, you won't realize how powerful it is at first.
3953;But by the conclusion, with its definitive, heart.
3954;wrenching portrayal of what will always be divided and what can never be, you will realize that the story has entered its souls.
3955;the cinematography was mesmerizing, those images were so beautiful, and they just keep coming back to reassure you.
3956;The music score was also remarkable, and it captured the essence and emotion of the film flawlessly.
3957;this adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly.
3958;Solid work all around and with Ang Lee's vision, they have created an amazing piece of cinema that should not be missed by anybody.
3959;Kudos to the phenomenal director of this film .
3960;Thank you so much for making this wonderful masterpiece.
3961;this is a powerful movie that totally worth checking out.
3962;Truly great directing of a great piece of literature.
3963;This is a wonderful love story in the harshest of circumstances, brought beautifully to life by director Ang Lee.
3964;This story is both moving and memorable.
3965;Thank you Ang Lee for bringing to the screen a most beautiful story filmed magnificently and thank you Annie Proulx for a truly great story.
3966;Granted, the movie is better than the book.
3967;There's a lot of beautiful scenery in this movie though and good acting.
3968;I went into this film with the mindset that it was going to be moving and interesting and an overall great film.
3969;I would have liked to see more of the emotions that compelled these two reluctant men to form a relationship.
3970;I can see that there was a good story to be told within, but it was just not explored.
3971;Obviously it found its fallowing, as there are 100s of wonderful reviews out there.
3972;eyed, and thought I'll just watch the first few minutes yeah, right.
3973;An absolutely classic, heartbreaking, work of art.
3974;The second disc gives good info about the soundtrack.
3975;First class script, Master Directing, Fantastic Actors/Actresses, What more can you ask for?Brokeback Mountain is a love story that will truly change who you are, and how you view the world.
3976;This is a move you have to see.
3977;The Ledger character, in particular, is held back by his childhood traumas from allowing himself intimacy.
3978;The Ledger character, in particular, is held back by his childhood traumas from allowing himself intimacy.
3979;This is a perfect film.
3980;The short story by Annie Proulx is heart wrenching, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sensitively developed into a complex exploration of self damage and collateral damage as a result of repression and isolation and Ang Lee brings that screeplay to life never pulling any punches.
3981;The actors, Health Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams, perfectly embody their characters and make them real
3982;Brokeback Mountain is an accurate depiction of the terror and heartbreak of gay love as a result of society's mores and the unavoidable result of self hate and its consequences.
3983;This film will go down in film history as one of the best films ever made.
3984;I have always enjoyed watching this movie.
3985;Its not a very complex story but the message is simple and meaningful.
3986;I also recommend reading the story, short but enjoyable too.
3987;I cried my eyes out watching this scenic epic drama, so full of love and life, much of which we can all relate to at some level and at some time in our lives.
3988;Toro: (crying) Hey Pancho, this wonderful movie Brokeback Mountain is as magnificent as other Westerns.
3989;Pancho: Si Toro, this movie is the Best I have ever seen.
3990;Seeing two wonderful played cowboys falling in love with each other is touching.
3991;Toro: Pancho, that fabulous gringo Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are a very well.
3992;Pancho: Si Toro, like other good cowboys, John Wayne, Steve McQueen, Burt Lancaster and Sam Peckinpah and they are very proud in their resting graves.
3993;Toro: Even the legendary Clint Eastwood love the motion picture.
3994;I am so proud and happy that this movie was released.
3995;That Love really exists between two men.
3996;I adore it and it's definitely more than just a gay cowboy love story
3997;Sorry Brokeback Mountain, but Crash should win best picture this year.
3998;The story is a story of love and infatuation and of infidelity, but at the same time it brings issues of prejudice and the boundaries of love into question.
3999;See this movie if you are willing to think outside of your standard framework.
4000;The greatest reviews for this film are, in a sense, the many thoughtful reactions of people on the Ultimate Brokeback Forum: [.]
4001;Many people have reflected on their lives and begun important changes as a result.
4002;I must say that normally I don't go for Heath Ledger, but his character showed a strength and roughly caring side for Jack that I liked.
4003;Its message goes way beyond the two men in the lead roles.
4004;Love is limitless, love is infinite, love is boundless.
4005;Love is a force, and however you find it, hold onto it.
4006;The fact that movies like this are drawing an average of 4.5 stars (out of 5) from over 750 reviewers is a definately positive sign .
4007;proof that we, the human race, are growing more open minded over time.
4008;So, without going into the details of the script, acting and cinematography, all of which are top.
4009;Of course, their actions create a domino effect, with the lives of their wives and families being affected as well.
4010;Moving, complicated and heartfelt, this is a film that you won't soon forget.
4011;A classic in the making.
4012;Both actors really got into their roles and made the audience believe that they were observing a relationship with it's ups and downs.
4013;This was a wonderful love story!!
4014;It will have you crying by the end.
4015;acted and beautiful cinematography and music.
4016;My favorite movie of all time.
4017;All that truly need be said of the film is that it is one of the most powerful and moving film experiences I have ever had.
4018;I was blown away by the raw power of the film, the depth of the characters, the beautiful score and cinematography.
4019;And the performances are amazing.
4020;A melancholy air runs through the film and the end is heart.
4021;It is simply a story of love forbidden and the lives it irreversibly scars.
4022;Hands down, the best movie of '05.
4023;Wow, i defintely got more than i bargained for with this movie.
4024;It's great that they effectively show how this one subject impacts so many people's lives for such a period.
4025;I'm glad i finally got to see that it lives up to all the press.
4026;As An Lee revealed in a interview, he just wanted to protray love in its purest form, without intention, calculation, procreation, or recreation.
4027;The movie makes us think what are important in our short lives.
4028;That is why this movie is a success, no matter what the box office indicates.
4029;Some lovely cinematography and an instantly riveting character study from Heath Ledger had us straight into watching a new classic mode.
4030;cowboy physicality turning sexual in what is conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location.
4031;from the compelling opening, the affair matures and gathers poignancy, evolving from sweet infatuation to tragic separation, as the smitten pair struggle to make conventional family lives work after they leave the lovely eponymous setting of their first meeting.
4032;The film has enough generosity to portray these doomed normal lives with dignity, too, evoking equal sympathy for the sensitively.
4033;You find yourself longing for the beauty and poignancy of John Voight's glorious Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy.
4034;eyes (with, of course, a cool mouth.
4035;Our Jake has gone unchallenged for too long, now: his reputation is the sum of great parts, rather than performances .
4036;Instead, as a nice deep focus window.
4037;change led swiftly into levity and undermined a lot of the decent efforts before, a feeling of Well, if you can't be bothered to let us hear what could have been a poignant anti.
4038;And far better, more complete films.
4039;brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing
4040;What Reviewer (above) likes to call contravesry (sic) is the essence of healthy exchange.
4041;I repeat that I found the (homo)sexuality conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location, and admired the film's generosity to the cowboys' doomed heterosexual partners.
4042;I'll even repeat: Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing.
4043;reviewer is clearly a big fan of Brokeback.
4044;rather more in keeping with the spirit of the film than his own less than charitable, pejorative outburst.
4045;it's a slow, but beautiful build.
4046;up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better.
4047;it's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too.
4048;Thus it is, in its own way, quite an acheivement.
4049;Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.
4050;This movie permitted people to see that being gay is normal and loving and acceptible.
4051;I have to say Brokeback Mountain was a really good movie.
4052;Brokeback Mountain has garnered up many awards and nominations in the past few months.
4053;Many people have a problem with the film simply because it is what they call a gay love story.
4054;I highly recommend this movie and encourage anyone with an open mind to check it out.
4055;Brokeback Mountain is a movie about 2 people who fall in love and despite what labels people may give it thats truly what this amazing film is about.
4056;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances especially Heath.
4057;I believe that true love, when it is discovered, is unescapable.
4058;I also feel the same about great movies.
4059;Regardless it's content a deeply moving experience will forever rest inside the individuals soul, as will Ennis' love for Jack and this movie will for me.
4060;'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the finest American love stories I have encountered in some time.
4061;It's passion is intense and palpable.
4062;The character's of Ennis and Jack, as portrayed brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, are caring, passionate, loyal, and tortured souls.
4063;I recommend any one interested to see for themselves.
4064;'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the most moving and haunting films of the past few years.
4065;It's a true work of beauty about love, loss, and the human spirit.
4066;Most of all it is an unescapable example of a love void of boundaries.
4067;But both actors are indeed great masters of the art of drama.
4068;They perform with full aplomb, their explosive rendition of raw emotions do not seem contrived or artificial.
4069;The director has done a superb job
4070;Of course the most impressive of all actors is Heath Ledger.
4071;Enhanced by a superb screenplay, mind.
4072;Annie's style is of clipped sentences, disjointed words that produce a remarkable semblance of intense empathy for her characters.
4073;The sexual content of this story is highly sensual and seem terrifyingly real as if the scenes leap out from the pages of the book.
4074;She is a highly stylized writer and commands a unique mastery over the usage of language that in a way creates a league of which she is the sole owner.
4075;Her finely etched characters seem so absolutely real that you feel a surge of pain when Jack Twist dies.
4076;she exhibits explosive finesse towards the end as the main protagonist Ennis enters a twilight zone, bereft of friends, family and most importantly his soul mate Jack Twist.
4077;You're assured that it is the end of the line for Ennis.
4078;This is real melodrama
4079;this is a remarkable gift that this writer possesses for this is not a story but an almost unwanted intrusion into your own life.
4080;This shows the caliber of the writer.
4081;Absolutely riveting, a dazzling piece of work, exquisite execution and rendition akin to a beautiful song .
4082;I think it will move anyone who's ever felt the pain that so often comes with the joy of love.
4083;If that's you, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
4084;My response is: big deal?This movie crossed the boundaries many viewers place on themselves about how human beings should behave.
4085;In fact, I am sure that many female viewers of this movie understand more about the attraction and love that made and destroyed these two characters better than most men do.
4086;But putting all that aside, I think all of us can agree that this movie has many extraordinary values, and if we can accept these values, or even appreciate these values for the true messages this movie delivers, then doesn't it just make sense that, whatever your viewpoint is, this is still a movie worth watching?Great job hollywood, keep up the good work.
4087;This reminds me of my literature professor a few years back when he said that the greatest works in literature can only be appreciated by the intelligent.
4088;The soft touch of the acoustic guitar triggers a bitter sweet feeling, and expressed the scenery as if the music itself is painting a picture.
4089;Obviously, the characters of this movie demand that the actors and actresses these qualities, which is very well done.
4090;If you enjoy nothing else about Brokeback Mountain, the breath taking cinematography alone is worth the price of the video.
4091;Heath and Jake give stellar performances in this movie and they deserve every award they received even if they didn't receive the oscar.
4092;It takes true actors to pull off a role like this and these guys more than deliver.
4093;This scene sets the tone for the entire movie.
4094;For instance neither Jack nor Ennis ever say the words I love you.
4095;But it has existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist forever.
4096;You don't nessesarily have to agree with the subject and contents of a movie to enjoy it.
4097;I for one can enjoy a movie for what it is.
4098;I am proud to have this film as a part of my video collection and you will too.
4099;Anyone with half a heart and an ounce of compassion will be moved by this piece of cinema.
4100;I felt this would have given the movie an ever more powerful emotional impact.
4101;Despite these minor technicalities the movie is still worth seeing.
4102;Give Brokeback Mountain a chance and I guarantee by the end of the film, after wiping away tears, the only word you will be able to utter is Beautiful.
4103;This was a gift, They loved it and that's all that matters to me.
4104;From what i heard it was a great movie.
4105;layered and subtle, as well as brave, that I don't see how he missed an Oscar for it.
4106;An extremely touching and beautiful movie, but sad and a little difficult to watch for that reason.
4107;The music was appropriate, the cinematography was breathtaking, and the acting and directing was superb.
4108;The best thing about this movie is that the it really doesn't hit you during the film, it hits you really hard right after.
4109;I watched the film a third time with a friend of mine who said she enjoed it.
4110;The next day, she told me that she kept thinking about the film and it had affected her later.
4111;That to me is the mark of a great film, not only is it good when you watch it but it gets better afterwards.
4112;Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare films that grabs and haunts you for weeks into months.
4113;Told in spare, elegant sequences.
4114;At night, they wake up in a tent, and start having passionate sex with each other.
4115;After four years, they finally meet again and have 'fun' with each other.
4116;stories, you'll love BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN!!!
4117;made miracle of a movie ever made.
4118;It is a story that every person on earth can relate to .
4119;the story is so real, you will relate to it immediately, no matter who you are.
4120;We have all known these characters, and as a result, we know that what we are seeing is real.
4121;What we are seeing is actually every day life .
4122;which is why the tragedy of the story has such a tremendous impact upon everyone who sees it.
4123;i recommend that you see this film at LEAST twice.
4124;Ang Lee has packed so many details into every frame that it is impossible to pick up on everyone in one viewing.
4125;There is THAT MUCH brilliance put into it.
4126;work in the final scene between Jack and Ennis, the stunning scene in which Ennis discovers the shirts in Jack's bedroom, and so much more will be written about and studied for decades to come.
4127;see also for at least 7 of the most brilliant acting performances ever put on film.
4128;Heath Ledger's career and life will be transformed forever by the unforgettable brilliance of his portrayal of Ennis.
4129;Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams also moved into the Big Leagues of Acting with their brilliant performances, which will delight and haunt you.
4130;Anne Hathaway is superb as the beautiful gal who becomes more blonde and stilted with every year of her loveless marriage.
4131;the film is very true to the story.
4132;I highly recommend that you read the story before seeing the film.
4133;It will greatly enhance your understanding of what takes place.
4134;Prepare for an unforgettable experience.
4135;I assured him that if he decided to see the film that it must be on the big screen.
4136;My partner of nearly 40 years was moved more than either of us would have imagined.
4137;I am thrilled that we were able to share the experience, and it continues to spur much, soulful conversation between us.
4138;a tear at a time, alternating eyes.
4139;this film not only made me proud to be a writer and gave me a deeper understanding of my beloved gay friends from my theatre days, but has restored my faith in humanity.
4140;It is a visual masterpiece.
4141;A hauntingly beautiful love story that expands and enlivens the heart.
4142;They just weren't very intersting and in a movie the characters have to be interesting in order for the audience to care about them.
4143;And I've even found myself agreeing with some of them.
4144;Though I will say the 2nd tent scene, when Ennis gets up and goes into Jack was pretty tender and loving.
4145;Painting these guys as promiscuous users is totally unfair to their characters, and the realities each dealt with.
4146;Well my friends, we do have happiness in our lives, and we do love, and we are often broken (just as you are), and sometimes more broken because of your cruelty.
4147;A really good review was posted on February 9th by Billy Bob.
4148;All you straight guys, close your eyes and imagine that you live on a planet where the majority was homosexual.
4149;Anyone with attractions to women were considered inferior and a spiritual abomination.
4150;It's a movie about cheating on your spouse, regardless of the time period it's placed in.
4151;Gee, I thought I was.
4152;Do you really think that your views are so right that you have to tell everyone else to wake up and agree with you?
4153;I doubt Brokeback will win best film.
4154;The acting is inspired
4155;Set in beautiful Wyoming, this film captures what love really means.
4156;A friend and I watched this late at night and had to go to a 24.
4157;it's just so heart wrenching .
4158;I own it because it's so real, the same reason I own Gibson's We Were Soldiers.
4159;Its open, unforced depiction of love between two men made Brokeback an instant cultural touchstone, for both good and bad, as it was tagged derisively as the gay cowboy movie, but also heralded as a breakthrough for mainstream cinema
4160;This film was raw and powerful, blew me away!The vast gorgeous scenery, the way the love scenes were done and the Heath Ledger's performance was breataking.
4161;he is going to go on and do some amazing things!
4162;As someone who has seen many movies in the last few weeks, I can say without a doubt that Brokeback Mountain is one of the best films to come out this holiday season.
4163;Heath Ledger does an amazing job, but so do Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and all of the other actors who aren't getting quite as much buzz.
4164;acted and incredibly moving film.
4165;conceived notions as it relates to this film, but it turned out to be a well done movie.
4166;thats the best you can do?
4167;go ahead, keep raising the price.
4168;As I type these words, Brokeback Mountain just won four Golden Globe awards including Best Drama.
4169;ennis is a taciturn, reserved and shy man.
4170;Jack is a charmer, a dreamer, a risk.
4171;Something deep inside stirs up a hornet's nest.
4172;ledger (Casanova) is extraordinary with his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, a man who has few words in his vocabulary, a man so repressed that he doesn't know how to express himself or go for what he wants.
4173;He's transformed himself realistically into a man that is so unlike the actor himself, who has mostly been known for his fluffy, light performances in the past.
4174;In contrast, Gyllenhaal (Proof) has the more lively role.
4175;Jack's longing for the man he loves is evident in Gyllenhaal's stellar performance.
4176;The men also share immense chemistry together.
4177;while one can argue that it's a character study of two men and their relationship, the women in the story add an immense appeal to the film.
4178;Williams (The Station Agent) is amazing with her heartbreaking performance as Ennis's long.
4179;When she witnesses something about her husband that she doesn't fully understand, her reaction is incredibly real and painful to watch.
4180;But her final scene is mesmerizing .
4181;Hathaway has matured into a fine actress.
4182;While the plot is simplistic, the acting is exceptional and there is so much going on at the thematic and emotional levels that one can't help but feel spellbound by the story.
4183;The dialogue is real and to the point .
4184;Mostly episodic, there are many fine moments in the film that are emotionally raw and powerful.
4185;The ending will haunt you.
4186;lee's direction is masterful, and it clearly demonstrates his versatility as a director.
4187;It's even more impressive when you consider Lee's heritage as a Chinese immigrant, and how he so deftly captures Americana in Brokeback Mountains.
4188;The cinematography by Rodgrigo Prieto (21 Grams) is breathtaking.
4189;I say this is a story about love and betrayal and life.
4190;the heterosexual aspects of the story are just as strong.
4191;If you have ever loved and lost before, you will feel the impact of this story.
4192;The film is like fine wine .
4193;it delicately lingers on your palate and seeps into your vein.
4194;Brokeback Mountain is destined to become an American classic.
4195;what can i say about a movie i've seen several dozen times, best love story ever, great acting jake was at top form.
4196;just saw zodiac another great performance by jake g. brokeback mountain just great all around and will stand the test of time
4197;That's is what I got from the movie.
4198;the movie will keep your tears in until the last moment.
4199;New classical American love story!
4200;But nothing in it really strikes me as great, even with its novelty of subject matter.
4201;situated buddies has a full and natural potential for finding romance of the kind not seen among the straight.
4202;all the actors in this movie are pained in some way and all express it beautifully, in their own unique way.
4203;it's easy to see it for what it is after viewing this movie.
4204;love like any other love.
4205;the scenery is rugged, romantic, outstanding .
4206;the haunting soundtrack compliments it perfectly.
4207;Brokeback Mountain is the film shows this example.
4208;brokeback Mountain is worthy of any high accolades because it follows in the similar footsteps as other legendary Hollywood films that possess epic qualities.
4209;the film's photography and soundtrack is effective throughout the film.
4210;The main themes as well as the piece Snow shows the tranquility of each scene in which it is played (the opening chords and melody plays similar to The Beatles' Blackbird).
4211;The main premise of Brokeback Mountain involves requited love and the relationship between two people that spans twenty years.
4212;That is the way I first found the short story.
4213;I knew nothing, had only read Accordion Crimes and Shipping News, and loved them both.
4214;Fast forward and I hear Ang Lee is making it into a movie, with two good actors to boot.
4215;Also Heath's,Ennis's wife, Michelle Williams as Alma, was perfect, both as a choice and her portrayal, and talk about a sympathetic role!
4216;That is the way I first found the short story.
4217;I knew nothing, had only read Accordion Crimes and Shipping News, and loved them both.
4218;Fast forward and I hear Ang Lee is making it into a movie, with two good actors to boot.
4219;Also Heath's,Ennis's wife, Michelle Williams as Alma, was perfect, both as a choice and her portrayal, and talk about a sympathetic role!
4220;I really was moved by Brokeback Mountain.
4221;It is a sad and often touching film, that should be seen at least once by anyone interested in cinema.
4222;The direction by Ang Lee is flawless in almost every frame.
4223;It is best for the viewer to think what they want about it.
4224;a student will find writing a thesis on the story, the film or book a great challenge.
4225;If you want to know what I am talking about, see the film again.
4226;brokeback Mountain is a wonderfully sad and disturbing film.
4227;This film is about love, lust and life.
4228;Heath Ledger is heart wrenchingly pure in his performance, as Ennis.
4229;The bittersweet original score sets the tone of the film perfectly and plucks my heartstrings every time I hear it.
4230;And the poignant memory of the shirts comforts me still.
4231;The movie talks about contraversy in racism, but where's the depth, the emotional connection, the spiritual value?
4232;This is absolutely the best movie you will ever see, as long as you are smart and have depth.
4233;This was the first movie I have watched that is a genuine love story between 2 men.
4234;Ennis and Jack share something special, but they can never reveal it to the world or even let on.
4235;This is 1963 and the heart of middle America, and you don't dare come out of the closet.
4236;It is a very good look at forbidden love.
4237;Well acted all the way around, with an interesting story.
4238;I would have enjoyed more of a buildup.
4239;Other than that, this was well crafted and worth a watch.
4240;It took me a few days to contemplate the remarkable film, and I can only say the it's the biggest feather in Ang Lee's hat.
4241;Mr. Lee's sensitivity never ceases to amaze me, from the hysterically funny The Wedding Banquet (another gay.
4242;Ang Lee's mastering of such diverse subjects, with amazing skill, must certainy rank him at the very top of our living directors.
4243;Brokeback Mountain is rife with style and focus.
4244;Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing
4245;All of the acting is, without exception, letter perfect.
4246;I especially liked the scene where he stood up to his big.
4247;His range of emotion was far more vast than what was expected from Ennis' character.
4248;The beautifully written script hit all the right nerves.
4249;This is NOT a gay movie
4250;I'm glad Mr. Lee won the Oscar.
4251;Even though I thought it was one of the Best Movie to every be made and showed how love and emotion can eat at you.
4252;ray because of the colorful scenes in the movie.
4253;If you dit bye the earlier version and loved it.
4254;Brokeback Mountain is a more than a film, certainly much more than a gay film.
4255;It is one of the saddest and most profound emotional experiences that you will ever encounter in a movie theatre.
4256;The tragic love story between two soulmates is brilliantly realized by Ang Lee, and the performances are flawless.
4257;Both Jake and Heath are remarkable.
4258;Everything blends beautifully in this powerful story.
4259;the script, the direction, the cinematograhy, the scoring, and the performances of the entire cast.
4260;I thought the movie was beautiful and it makes me ache inside.
4261;I traveled by train for an hour to see this film in NYC because it wasn't playing anywhere on Long Island.
4262;The movie scenery alone was worth the trip.
4263;That's exactly what it is.
4264;The movie portrays that love to be as genuine, as special, and as fulfilling as the love between straight people
4265;We also read from many, that it portrays love that cuts across gender lines.
4266;It is a love story between two gay men (even if they can't identify themselves as gay).
4267;they herded sheep for one summer of the 20 years spanning the film.
4268;Just two men who loved each other more than their wives,,, more than anyone else.
4269;it was a great movie all around.
4270;Brokeback Mountain flowed really well, the soundtrack was great.
4271;It was acted very well and with Gustavo Santaolalla's compositions accompany the movie very well.
4272;Other than that, i liked the movie greatly.
4273;i grew up watching Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, and all the other classic western stars, so the idea of watching a film about two cowboys in love with each other just did not seem to be a road I wanted to travel.
4274;But the script was by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Ang Lee was the director, Heath Ledger has become a very interesting actor, and the rest of the cast was fine.
4275;ups and prejudices sneak up on you.
4276;The first half only lays the groundwork for the second half of the movie and that is where you will see why all the acclaim and awards.
4277;The first half is necessary, but it is the second half that shines.
4278;If you have an ounce of soul you will feel the pain and the love as it builds to a final fifteen minutes that is as good as filmmaking gets.
4279;It will squeeze your heart.
4280;i just want to thank everyone envolved with this picture, and really hope it cleans up at the awards.
4281;There's hundreds of gut wrenching, and promising true life stories on the Brokeback Mountain website.
4282;I really believe this film will open quite a few eyes.
4283;The land of the free, and the home of the brave.
4284;It seems to me, alot of us are brave enough to be who we really are.
4285;I knew it was going to take some time, but I've always thought we lived in a country that always takes the Bull by the Horns, and shows everyone else in this world what freedom is all about.
4286;I'm thinking very positive about this film.
4287;I sure hope it's a turning point for all of us.
4288;Still, this movie shows true emotion, master craftmanship, and dedication which Crash, though well intentioned, cannot match!
4289;the story is handled so artfully.
4290;screen images are beyond imagination.
4291;Annie Proulx is a wonderful author.
4292;One definitely has to understand, or at least be sensitive to the homosexual psyche to like this film.
4293;Jack is the aggressor who starts the sexual relationship by successfully seducing Ennis.
4294;Ennis, on the other hand was always fully cognizant of the forbidden nature of his friendship with Jack and was never as comfortable with it as Jack was.
4295;This kind of love story obviously has to end in tragedy.
4296;this was a very accurate portrayal of married men who have a homosexual side, in the present as well as in past decades.
4297;Basically all i hear about this film was it was about gay cowboys and highly political with somekind of agenda attached to it.
4298;For this film was nothing but pure beauty and a kind of love that no one could ever come between.
4299;i was brought up in the 60's and i'm sure each of us on some level in that era has a Broke Back Mountain story that we've experienced.
4300;i now have a partner of many many years and i'm in my middle 50's.
4301;Are love and bond is extremely tight.
4302;What closeness and the feeling of being one that we experienced.
4303;This film speaks to all of us that believe in true and everylasting love.
4304;My hat off to the great director and to the two wonderful actors of Heath and Jake for the most convincing roll of two men so in love that you could feel each others happyness and pain.
4305;This film is wonderful and i'm hoping it will be a classic among all ages, all people and all races.
4306;Just want to say that it is a classic American story and a classic western.
4307;It is a great romance in the time.
4308;It has one of the best film scripts ever produced.
4309;In Heath Ledger, it has a screen.
4310;acting performance that is among the best of all time.
4311;Unmissable and worth at leaat two viewings.
4312;I was expecting an epic love story like the trailers and reviews tout it to be.
4313;i was told by a friend, Life doesn't always have a happy ending.
4314;This movie leaves the viewers with a lot of what.
4315;ifs to answer: the most important being, what if Jack and Ennis spend their whole life together.
4316;The story and the people in it are just so much more than fiction!
4317;Somehow Ennis and Jack, as well as the other characters, are just as complex as real people.
4318;Heath and Jake are just perfect as Ennis and Jack!!
4319;The greatness of their love is in the fact that they can't let go of eachother, even though the problems of their relationship hurts them.
4320;The love is stronger than the pain it causes!
4321;But this is to possibly slight Ang Lee whose work is consistently more subtle and extensive than Menghalis's.
4322;For one thing, the mountain itself has a prominent and passionate place in Lee's telling.
4323;wrenching love story of the year.
4324;Jack (played Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) seemed more like really good buddies, who just happened to have sex with each other because there were no women around.
4325;all in all, Brokeback Mountain was a solid, good movie.
4326;Heath Ledger was perfect as Ennis.
4327;lipped and emotionally congested cowboy.
4328;eyes to his best advantage as the bull rider with the fantastical dreams of domestic bliss with Ennis.
4329;Nobody could reach Ennis's heart.
4330;From all the hype, I anticipated a sweeping love story between two cowboys.
4331;I anticipated scenes of highly charged but tastefully photographed lovemaking between two men.
4332;Ennis and Jack are far more at home in the sweeping, breathtaking expanse of wild America than they are in their respective cramped city apartment and suburban home.
4333;This tension is the best part of the movie.
4334;also interesting is the complicated relationships between the men and their wives and families.
4335;much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance and he should have won the Academy Award.
4336;Instead of bickering, each man finds peace in the wild .
4337;He calls the widow who explains that Jack's family won't allow Jack's ashes to be scattered on Brokeback.
4338;She then offers the perplexed man the opportunity of visiting Jack's bedroom.
4339;up of his face as he slowly realizes: Jack loved me.
4340;A few moments pass as Ennis's face contorts with the belated knowledge that he was in love with Jack as well.
4341;(Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother also offers a dazzling performance.
4342;As the camera stays on his back, we hear a door open.
4343;covered face proffers a gentle kiss on the bare neck.
4344;Their eyes are radiant with love.
4345;A good story and acting should define a movie, especially in the category of drama.
4346;The key was to look beyond those labels to be able to see a good movie.
4347;`Brokeback Mountain' is a very good movie when broken down to its talents: story, script, directing, acting, cinematography and music.
4348;this is a story first and foremost about love.
4349;on and the Oscar was well deserved.
4350;the scenery, cinematography and music really set the stage for the overall look and feel of the movie.
4351;Sure Gyllenhaal did a good job, but he didn't do a great job.
4352;To me it was complete raw emotion and perfectly acted.
4353;i thought Williams did an excellent job in her role.
4354;It'd be nice to think she'll be known more for this than something like `Dawson's Creek'.
4355;it'd be an instant classic
4356;It covers a lot of time, and its characters go through a lot.
4357;but to a greater extent it's a mood or tone piece.
4358;first, let me touch on the good stuff.
4359;Heath Ledger (as Ennis)is very good.
4360;to me he got better as the film went along.
4361;or the love of his life.
4362;Michelle Williams is very sympathetic as his wife.
4363;Randy Quaid, in a small role, is frankly quite riveting.
4364;Glynenhaal, to me, is the weakest link.
4365;He's always full of mischief and high.
4366;It's there, and it comes out at times, but sometimes I felt the actor was coasting a little bit.
4367;He's still quite good, but is not up to Ledger's performance, and not worthy of the Oscar.
4368;The music is very good.
4369;they have found the love of their lives with each other, and can only endulge for a few days a year.
4370;these two men are depriving their spouses of intimacy.
4371;and the universal truth one might draw from it is that if only these men had been able to spend their lives openly together without fear of consequence from society.
4372;That's certainly a valid question, but to generalize the movie to such a global conclusion, in my mind, diminishes the power of the movie itself.
4373;Put simply, just enjoy the movie on its own terms.
4374;The polarization actually keeps people away from the film, I believe.
4375;for me, this is a very good film.
4376;I mentioned already all the things I liked.
4377;brokeback Mountain is a fantastic movie about two men hopelessly in love in an oppressive time.
4378;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is considered great by Americans who've never seen a wire.
4379;all that said, both Lee and McMurtry have made a career.
4380;best film with Brokeback Mountain, which is a good movie.
4381;in other words, as far from civilization as one can get in America and still actually be in America.
4382;During the months the two are up there, they develop a relationship that haunts them the rest of their lives.
4383;All four of the principals turn in fine acting jobs.
4384;Gyllenhaal can make anything (with the exception of The Day After Tomorrow) worth watching
4385;loved cult films of the last decade.
4386;The cinematography, as is to be expected, is fantastic (one of the things I will remember about this movie for the rest of my life is the scene where they're first herding a river of sheep up the side of the mountain), and the story comes together well and stays together, for the most part, throughout.
4387;were it that simple, this would be a great film.
4388;it's easy to keep track of where you are.
4389;Brokeback Mountain is a good film, to be sure, but it's far from perfect.
4390;Still, it's a good film, and one worth seeing, especially for Jake Gyllenhaal fans.
4391;I have waited for ages to see this after all the hype and extreme reviews at each end of the spectre.
4392;many small sequences are so fast ,it probably needs another viewing, but already my opinion is ,Ang Lee has touched the face of god, unlike the rednecks who will remain in ignorance for eternity.
4393;To those yet to see it, remember, we are all gods creations and he made us all for a purpose and those who judge in his name will answer to him.
4394;the storyline is pretty well.
4395;During the course of the summer, Jack gradually draws Ennis out of his shell and the two unexpectedly start a sexual relationship.
4396;Cinematography is so beautiful at points, it's almost too much for the eyes to comprehend.
4397;The musical score is understated and feels perfectly at home within the film.
4398;as for the actors, Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger played their roles beautifully.
4399;At that point, the plot takes a sudden and surprisingly.
4400;As it climaxes, you're left with a rush of emotion that surprises you and that few films have ever been able to garner.
4401;The entire film is a leadup to one simple message, one simple premise.
4402;It is unapologetic, yet compassionate.
4403;In my opition, of all the films I know of in this decade, so far, Brokeback Mountain is THE film of the decade!
4404;It has so much going for it: great direction, suburb cast, beautiful camera work, superior script, excellent casting
4405;Love found, almost by accident, love lost, love rediscovered.
4406;For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all.
4407;broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult.
4408;For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs.
4409;Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.
4410;now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie?
4411;Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment.
4412;The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, gay or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love.
4413;Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful?
4414;Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world?
4415;Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills?
4416;a. lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard?
4417;Most definitely!In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain.
4418;But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar.
4419;The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain.
4420;For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all.

4433;The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain.
4434;This film is a MASTERPIECE in all aspects: the score is beautiful, the screenplay is flawless, the cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is incredible.
4435;This is a richly moving and beautiful film, a classic love story of human emotion.
4436;Sure it's graphic but with Jake and Heath as real actors.
4437;we pretty much know who and what they are in real life.
4438;both on men who love other men as well as the cost for a society held back from acceptance, understanding and compassion.
4439;What a joy it would be to approach one another unapologetically .
4440;acceptable shell to project to others.
4441;It is amazing that this brief (65.
4442;7) This is a movie (and story) which helped me to advance along my road of life in a more meaningful way.
4443;I hope we all will come to be in debt to it's vision, as well.
4444;this could have led to an interesting film.
4445;Apart from a couple of memorable lines that reflect back over a couple of decades of love, where does either of the leads say anything funny or compelling or even remotely interesting?
4446;despite the dramatic vacuity at the heart of the movie, this is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've ever seen.
4447;The landscapes in this are as beautifal as in any movie I have ever seen, and the incredibly gifted Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto could very well win the Oscar for Best Achievement in Cinematography.
4448;the film is made with enormous competence.
4449;The score is good, the direction is strong, and while the characters are uninteresting, all of the performances are quite strong.
4450;I have not read Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based, but I can even imagine it being a good story.
4451;It is, however, a truly beautiful movie to look at.
4452;In fact, I think much of the praise the film is receiving is in fact the reflected glory of the landscapes.
4453;Went into this movie cautiously, eyes wide open.
4454;I have to admit, I really liked it.
4455;At first it was pretty startling.
4456;It was interesting to see how the women in the men's lives dealt with what their husbands sexuality entailed.
4457;1963 Wyoming range provides a quaint and ultimately charming setting for the spirited romance between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal).
4458;Specifically, they are after the magic of their first summer together.
4459;something readily transcending labels, categories, and generations.
4460;director Ang Lee did a tremendous job with the movie, based upon E. Annie Proulx's short story.
4461;Credit also goes to Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurty for a great screenplay.
4462;In addition to it being set in the early 1960's there actually is the feel.
4463;i am really impressed with the people who were involved with this film.
4464;I honestly do find it shocking that these hang.
4465;drama, Best Director, Best Actor Motion Picture Drama, and Best Supporting Actress.
4466;remember BB won most of all the major awards leading up to the Oscars.
4467;Just being nominated was an achievement in itself.
4468;The subject of rascism is an important topic to address, Crash just didnt address it very well.
4469;It touched the hearts of more people and will continue to do so throughout the years.
4470;in fact go see all the Oscar nominated films.
4471;The film will live on with generations to come.
4472;An excellent value for the price.
4473;From the very first time I saw this magnificent film, based on the short story by Annie Proulx, brought to the screen with the words of Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry under the direction of Ang Lee, we have two fictional characters, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, who have been achingly and heartbreakingly brought to life through the performances of actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger.
4474;Add to that the spectacular cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the haunting musical score by Gustavo Santoalalla, and the sum is a truly memorable piece of artisitic film work that will be venerated for years to come.
4475;However on very careful examination, one finds additional visual material at the top and bottom of the full screen frame, for example, the scene immediately following the reunion kiss scene.
4476;In the full screen version we see Ennis' wedding ring throughout the scene, in the widescreen version we do not see Ennis' wedding ring at all .
4477;It would be the best movie I have ever seen.
4478;Great work from Ang Lee.
4479;This movie is about forbidden love between two men.
4480;Ledger was fantastic as Innes and Gyllenhaal was fabulous as Jack.
4481;It so touched my heart I felt like standing in the middle of the road with a big sign saying : Watch Brokeback Mountain.
4482;Michelle Williams, who plays Innes's wife was truly great at her role.
4483;Anne Hatheway also made a great impact on me.
4484;It is a film with 4 fantastic actors, sad yet romantic.
4485;It is film that will stay in my heart for ever.
4486;to truly make the world a better place?
4487;Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself.
4488;and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.
4489;Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways .
4490;tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre.
4491;wristed best friends of the main female character.
4492;Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love .
4493;and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.
4494;as Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting.
4495;A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time.
4496;As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him.
4497;Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband.
4498;ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser.
4499;like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama.
4500;Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.
4501;But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are.
4502;This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.
4503;when the history of the movies comes to be written, Brokeback Mountain will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed watersheds or landmarks, movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do.
4504;Simply a transcendent and sublime work of art!
4505;Kudos to Annie and Larry and Diana and Ang and Heath and Jake and Michelle and Ann and Randy, et al, for their unflinchingly honest, life.
4506;For they have persuasively and hauntingly demonstrated by it that love is indeed a force of nature
4507;Best picture of the year.
4508;A love story for the ages.
4509;Yeah, the acting, direction and cinematography were top.
4510;For a 2 1/2 film that spans over 20 years, you'd expect some character development.
4511;A far better film was Far From Heaven.
4512;I think the actors did an amazing job besides Jake and Heath are so hot.
4513;Brokeback Mountain is more than a love story, the emotions flowing the discontent, the longing to be with someone, best love story I have ever seen.
4514;EVERY story in this collection is brilliant.
4515;The movie's only a faint echo of Proulx's wonderful observations and characterizations.
4516;(ALL Proulx's work is great
4517;This was one of the Best movies I have ever seen.
4518;it was the Best LOVE story between two people that I have ever seen.
4519;the LOVE intensity between the two cowboys is so heart whrenching, that it grabs at your very soul.
4520;i was so moved that it brought me to tears and made me think about myself and my own love life.
4521;Heath Ledger is simply perfect, as are virtually all of the actors in this film
4522;sharp attention to the detail.
4523;I so hope that people everywhere will see this movie .
4524;it is much bigger than a gay romance .
4525;it is about holding things in
4526;It's one of those rare things in life that is truly .
4527;Heath Ledger is simply perfect, as are virtually all of the actors in this film
4528;sharp attention to the detail.
4529;I so hope that people everywhere will see this movie .
4530;it is much bigger than a gay romance .
4531;it is about holding things in
4532;It's one of those rare things in life that is truly .
4533;The scenery in this movie is breathtaking.
4534;Yes, there can be tacit love.
4535;Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative.
4536;If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you.
4537;You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life.
4538;You bring that spark to everything you do.
4539;It sustains and animates you.
4540;It makes you want to perfect.
4541;Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece of a film.
4542;Everyone involved deserves kudos for bringing this brilliant film to the screen.
4543;most of the praise for this movie has gone to Heath Ledger and his brilliant performance.
4544;His Jack is the heart of this love story.
4545;He is especially amazing in their final scenes.
4546;He captures the words of Annie Proulx in their most tender scenes.
4547;He says so much with his eyes it is heartbreaking.
4548;Also, the Jack character should get attention because he is brave and is willing to live his life with the person he loves.
4549;He is not afraid of his feelings and that is so important.
4550;While her role is not as big, it is very important and her last scene is fantastic.
4551;Along with the wonderful Michelle Williams and her heartbreaking Alma.
4552;overall a brilliant film that deserves all the accolades and awards it has received.
4553;Heath and Jake both make this heartbreaking and beautiful love story come to life.
4554;Amazing film about true human feelings.
4555;Anyway, as I was saying, a true and honest film that will stay in your heart forever if given the chance.
4556;A film that has and will open many hearts and minds.
4557;It is the type of movie that seeing it once is enough.
4558;i believe true love with that special somebody can bring so much more happiness and fulfillment into ones life.
4559;For myself this film clearly shows this, and what true love can bring on the flipside.
4560;I would love for Jake and I to move to Massachusetts where I would become Mrs. Jake Gyllenhall.
4561;cause I'm a lady and I don't top.
4562;I felt a lot of sympathy with their wives who paid a heavier price than their men.
4563;Yes, for fans, this is beyond a let.
4564;Where's the rare Annie Proulx commentary that would really cap it?BUTAs a gift, it's great.
4565;And because they delayed the release, it'll be a nice post.
4566;This movie is the touchstone for those of us who had our own brokeback Mountains sometime in our lives.
4567;And noone in their right mind would ever want to be concieved as one of them.
4568;Stereotypes abounded on what they were and how they acted and behaved.
4569;We, as Jack and Ennis learned early to fight what came natural to us, as we strove to fit in, keep silent and deny what was really going on in our minds and hearts.
4570;See how both Jack and Ennis act so wooden in their marraiges and how they come to life only in each others arms, and you will see what I mean.
4571;after surviving the Atomic Wars of divorce, estrangement by immediate family, I got my reward.
4572;The more I think about this movie, the more I think it's actually a very BAD movie, both politically and artistically.
4573;Brokeback Mountain portrayed gay men in a human and honest fashion.
4574;It did so while gently and convincingly telling a story that is so believable and genuine that if you do not feel any emotions after viewing the film, you sadly missed out on a wonderful and special experience.
4575;as anyone can see from the overwhelming positive and emotional responses this film has generated, it has had a significant and very real impact on millions upon millions of fans whose lives are forever changed.
4576;this is a film that will be remembered.
4577;Brokeback Mountain was filmed with the intention of winning the Oscar's Best Picture of the Year, and not so much in sales.
4578;this movie shows how, when someone can put their selfish reasons aside and concentrate on higher purposes, they can truly produce magnificent masterpieces such as Brokeback Mountain.
4579;is a wonder, loving Jack Twist [Jake Gyllenhal, equally superb
4580;He's great whether riding a horse, kissing a girl, *or* kissing his one True Love.
4581;It's commanded right there in The Bible, right next to the prohibition against gayness.]
4582;One of the best if not the best from this decade, alone.
4583;Emotionally griping and very compelling.
4584;i love it when, HOLLYWOOD, tells a controversial story.
4585;With all biases behind, this is a must see for everyone.
4586;HOLLYWOOD KEEP PUSHING THE ENVELOPE so we can see movies, true movies, unfiltered movies!
4587;A film has never made me feel so emotional.
4588;God love you Ang Lee for making such a wonderful film!
4589;All of the actors should be so proud of themselves also.
4590;I loved this movie, it is my favorite to date and will be in my heart forever.
4591;There are moments in the film that I don't think I fully understood or heard what was being said.
4592;So, I waited a couple weeks and watched it again.
4593;it was so refreshing to see a gay.
4594;the actors are believable, the soundtrack was beautifully complementary.
4595;For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all.
4596;broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult.
4597;For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs.
4598;Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.
4599;now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie?
4600;Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment.
4601;The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, [.]
4602;Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful?
4603;Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world?
4604;Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills?
4605;a. lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard?
4606;Most definitely!In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain.
4607;But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar.
4608;The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain.
4609;A breakthrough picture for gay rights.
4610;such bouquets diminish the universal themes found in the movie's story of two men .
4611;Aside from the job, that's their first bond.
4612;the Academy Award winning screenplay from Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana explores how the men live on unsteadily, marry women, have children, and get together one or twice a year for a fishing trip.
4613;What Lee, McMurtry and Ossana transform her story into is an epic that reveals the pain Ennis spreads to his wife Alma (Michelle Williams), the daughter most like him (Kate Mara) and, after divorcing Alma, to a hopeful waitress named Cassie (Linda Cardellini).
4614;we could do it over the phone, he tells Ennis .
4615;for all its anguish, Brokeback Mountain has a lovely, good.
4616;natured screenplay full of small asides and local humor, probably courtesy of McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show).
4617;It allows us to enjoy the men as men, the women as women, a laugh as a laugh.
4618;Lee orchestrates a particularly good scene on Thanksgiving, where a long.
4619;Lee has already helmed a domestic masterpiece in The Ice Storm
4620;table truths with artistic helicopter shots of the mountain.
4621;He is the picture of repression in Brokeback Mountain a character worth genuine pity who, when he finds the right words for his daughter in the movie's last scene, has accomplished a feat 20 years in the waiting.
4622;Gyllenhaal is 25, yet he plays the older Jack fiercely.
4623;Both twang and spit the distinctive cowboy chatter of the screenplay with ease.
4624;This is a work of art.
4625;Pop culture has done it few favors.
4626;I very much love Brokeback Mountain the movie, I read the story as well and felt that Ang Lee followed it perfectly.
4627;I would recommend this movie to anyone, gay, straight, and undecided, because it is a genuine love story.
4628;Brokeback Mountain is a tour de force .
4629;a film about fated love thwarted by human repression.
4630;Ang Lee calmly unfolds the canvas on which he has captured the heart and spirit of Annie Poulx's raw and honest short story.
4631;The spectacular Western landscapes represent the spirit of purity and endurance, and Brokeback Mountain is that special place where love can be freely expressed.
4632;But back in the harsh mundane world, Ennis' internal struggle to deal with this love is the heart of the movie.
4633;The kiss between Jack and Ennis when Michelle Williams first sees them is a wonderful scene.
4634;i give this movie a very vehemet one star!
4635;It's so powerful and full of raw emotions that I can't shake it even several days later.
4636;I like it better and better.
4637;There's a lot to admire and notice, even on subsequent viewings.
4638;outstanding camera work and scenery, jaw dropping performances and a truly complex yet gripping story line.
4639;The couple soon has a son.
4640;The men reunite, and their passion immediately rekindles.
4641;Jack's mother is more welcoming, and allows Ennis to see Jack's boyhood bedroom.
4642;Ennis asks if her fiance loves her, and she affirms that he does.
4643;Ennis carefully fastens the top button of Jack's shirt.
4644;Michelle Williams was good in her role as an innocent wife who discovers her husband's secret.
4645;The rest of the supporting cast was good as well Jake .
4646;above All a very touching love story.
4647;Brokeback's recommended viewing so it can disclose to people just how anti.
4648;A conservative hoodlum is in the White House, a $200 million blockbuster about a giant ape is the top film at the box office, and the main film critics and moviegoers with any kind of sense are talking about is a quiet love story between two cowboys in the Wyoming mountains playing in a handful of theatres.
4649;It is a startling film about the connection between two lonely souls in the bleak landscape of the midwest.
4650;Heath and Jake have amazing chemistry which slowly pulls you into the film but eventually turns you inside out as their relationship grows darker.

4654;this is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.
4655;truly one of the most beautifully haunting love stories ever brought to the screen.
4656;the actors do a superb job of capturing the conflicting emotions of being in love with someone that society deems unnatural or a crime, and the heart.
4657;wrenching angst that they feel is beautifully conveyed through their actions and expressions.
4658;i would highly recommend this film to anyone.
4659;because the screenplay and everything else is good.
4660;Because every single word as every in the play of what they talk about.
4661;it was simply a much better movie.
4662;everyone saw two men in love.
4663;You saw a beautiful consumation of their love.
4664;I saw two men brutally raping each other, loving it, and coming back for more.
4665;And I'm very glad Crash beat it for Best Picture.
4666;please people, see the big picture here.
4667;I did watch it twice.
4668;Third, is an explosive mix of taboo and today's political correctness.
4669;This was a very good movie but definitely not a kid's movie.
4670;A genuine true love between two people regardless of their sexual orientation.
4671;And it showed how life is life.
4672;It did get a bit maudlin in couple of times but you certainly came away from the picture emotionally moved.
4673;It was certainly a bold step for it's time.
4674;I remember well when it came out.
4675;the funniest memory about this film and I'm not joking .
4676;When it got to the scene where the characters made love for the first time .
4677;It is also important that more of the world be exposed to the concept that same.
4678;sex couples can love each other.
4679;I went into it really wanting to love it.
4680;I was so happy that a movie had been made featuring gay (or at least bi) men as the focus of this romance, and that it had been nominated for so many Academy Awards.
4681;I also felt that the jumpiness of the storyline got in the way of the entire movie.
4682;I'm going to give it two stars though .
4683;one for the subject matter and one for the scenic vistas.
4684;And I will hold out hopes that this movie will end up being the first step towards mainstreaming this subject matter, so that future genuinely great movies can be made featuring gay themes.

4686;sums up in essence the message portrayed on the screen.

4689;Becoming friends, and then more than friends, Jack and Ennis forge a bond that spans decades and a lifetime.
4690;Through all that life brings them, marriages, children, divorce, loss of jobs, family problems, and even discovery by Ennis' wife, the ties that bind them together survive.
4691;While Jack wants more, believing they can build a life together, dispite what society considers exceptable, Ennis, ever stoic, believes otherwise.
4692;Heath Ledger bestowes the performance of his career on the viewer with dignity and emotional depth that was only hinted at in his previous work.
4693;Jake Gyllenhall finally realizes the potential that the critics foresaw in him and also puts in his best work to date.
4694;The interaction of the two principal actors is believable, conceivable, and all together entrancing.
4695;The supporting cast is also brilliant, each bringing to their character a fully realized person no matter the size of their role.
4696;The direction and cinematography is a masterpiece, bringing to light the isolation of the wilderness, the desperation of small towns of the era, and the complete dissimilarity of the classes of the time.
4697;Ang Lee has created a world where the viewer feels he or she can touch, taste, smell, and feel all that is portrayed on the screen.

4709;It is a fully drawn character portrait of 2 characters who meet, but are not in the same spot at the time.
4710;Director Ang Lee has ever been better.
4711;This is a multi Award winning is a most memorable film!
4712;After watching Brokeback Mountain, it is now one of my favorite movies.
4713;A love story that shows how decisions .
4714;Brokeback Mountain is such a touching and compelling movie.
4715;It moved me to the core.
4716;i cried and cried at the end.
4717;I'd highly recommend it to anybody who's ever been in a relationship where they've struggled with decisions .
4718;especially the difficult one of should I stay with the person I'm with or should I take a chance and follow my heart and be with the one that I truly love.
4719;this movie should've won the Oscar.
4720;It is truly one of the best films ever made.
4721;I have to begin by saying that it has been a very long time since I have seen a film with such enormous, emotional intelligence and resonance as this work displays.
4722;Jack [Jake Gyllenhaal] is dramaticly more available, passionate and needs driven than his lover.
4723;Their love is a tender and tragic pot.
4724;Oscar and BAFTA nominations and indeed wins, simple must be in the offing for both.
4725;utterly beautiful both physically and emotionally and a film which has much to document about the power of love and attraction and the destruction of hatred and bigotry.
4726;as stunning an interpretation of Annie Proulx's delightful novella, as it would be possible to produce.
4727;a certain and indelable, must see of a film.
4728;I did enjoy the commentary by Lee and his partner in crime Schamus for 'Crouching Tiger' so I was looking forward to something like that.
4729;Its a classic and is timeless.
4730;In my opinion the photography and settings were the best in this movie.
4731;Living in a gay community myself and being straight has enlightened me and opened my mind.
4732;I have friends that are gay and they don't come across as these two guys.
4733;first, BM is based on the short story by Annie Proulx, I have the short story, and it's almost EXACT the same as the movie (good job Ang Lee!)
4734;Amazing cinematography, scenery, emotional depth and complex character development.
4735;Sound track was great too.
4736;Short review: Strip away the nice soundtrack and pretty cinematography, and all we have here is an average Lifetime Network weeper with two homosexual men as the leads.
4737;Others rave about Ang Lee's beautiful portrayal of the American West, and it is certainly nice, but merely window dressing.
4738;i don't have many modern favorite films, actually most of the films coming out today are such brain.
4739;rest Peacefully, Heath, and Thank You.
4740;I really enjoyed this movie but I don't understand why it was considered to be so spectacular.
4741;wrenching love story, compounded by the fact that so many people got hurt when two men who loved each other married women instead and fathered children.
4742;cinematography was fantastic and in general, I liked it very much but personally, I wouldn't have voted in for best picture.
4743;The women in this film are very talented actresses and I cry for their characters as well.
4744;This film is beautifully done and the scenery is breathtaking.
4745;It is a gift to the world.
4746;As a straight white married women I learned that gay love is as powerful and beautiful as mine is for my husband.
4747;It is a beautifully shot look at the way wandering cowboys worked and the often harsh life they lead.
4748;It's amazing to think that the story is set as recently as the 1960s since it almost feels as though it was set in the nineteenth century.
4749;The soundtrack was particularly haunting, certainly moving my girlfriend Natasha to tears in several places.
4750;I am glad it sparks some more discussions, and if it opens more folks up to justice and kindness, that is wonderful.
4751;ennis was a right jerk.
4752;He was a jerk to Jack, to his kids, to Alma and to himself.
4753;Her scene of sharing the truth with Ennis in the only way either dared, with eyes and careful words, was one of the most depressing and brave scenes in the film.
4754;Jack was the juiciest one in the film, the one with the most life.
4755;It shows that true love can be found anywhere.
4756;Many beautiful pictures, good music and a melancholy plot, but not much more.
4757;Jack cannot give him a clear answer, but my impression is now that this is precisely the film's theme.
4758;The surprising and beautiful part in Brokeback Mountain is that during the months they spend there together Ennis and Jack indeed find a common language, one that goes beyond friendship and sex.
4759;There are never such simple gestures of trust and tenderness between them and their women as Ennis and Jack find when they are together.
4760;ang Lee's directing style is very quiet and subtle
4761;american blockbuster presenting a moral on a silver plate.
4762;in the end Brokeback Mountain is a western, and friendship and companionship between men is a central matter in almost all western stories
4763;it is a great love story, no sociocritical piece or plea for minorities.
4764;For many days now I have lingered on this film.
4765;Not for it's subject matter, I have sat through and enjoyed many gay themed films.
4766;Personally I was deeply moved by this film.
4767;Brokeback Mountain makes you realize how powerful a force like love is.
4768;It can create such beauty and passion.
4769;But I really loved the way that you could guess what he was feeling just from his facial expressions.
4770;I recently heard that he was set to do the Film adaptation of Life of Pi and if it is anywhere as good as this adaptation of Annie Proulx's story(which is worth a look) then I will be eternally grateful.
4771;After much debate, I decided to view this film with an open mind.
4772;I really liked the music composition, as it flowed gently with the story.
4773;location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch.
4774;Overall, this is a movie that will advance gay right in the United States.
4775;Ang Lee's film is groundbreaking in that it is a mainstream movie that portrays passion between two men.
4776;The job is for the summer and they must camp out with the sheep.
4777;They share the stories of their love deprived childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.
4778;They make love and develop a passionate bond.
4779;Taciturn Ennis is nearly incapable of revealing, let alone talking, about his feelings to the more demonstrative Jack.
4780;Both are married with children in their attempts to fit in to the demands of culture.
4781;Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.
4782;this film creates an atmosphere of love and longing, while unflinchingly showing the lack of acceptance by mainstream culture of alternate lifestyles.
4783;The scenic splendour of nature is filmed with haunting clarity.
4784;This provides an element of nature, almost as another character in the film, acting as a neutral witness to human passion.
4785;Gyllenhaal and Ledger are touching and beautiful in their roles.
4786;The supporting actresses playing their wives, Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway, provide accurate and devastating performances.
4787;This movie deserves all the nominations it received.
4788;Go see this movie with your friends or loved ones.
4789;It will open up your eyes, especially if you're straight.
4790;Maybe some folks are happy to see a movie about guys in manly jobs that are bi.
4791;The only thing this movie has going for it as far as I can see is the beautiful photography which can be seen in other movies or a good educational television station.
4792;All these men did in the end is wind up hurting women.
4793;When the film was first released, somehow I thought all the praises and wonderful reviews were just hype.
4794;After seeing this movie on Yahoo's box office chart for ages, I've decided to watch its trailer, and wept.
4795;i went to watch BM the day after the Academy Awards, and felt that for me, it was the best film of the year.
4796;Although the movie was based on a short story, they've enriched the characters so much that made you felt like you've loved for a lifetime as well.
4797;The emotions seeped out from the screen in waves and circled me into its realm, and I appreciate this element very much.
4798;What a love story he made.
4799;It is very moving and it feels very heavy.
4800;it's the force that stops you, sets you free, makes you somebody, makes you a nobody, makes you see things, makes you blind, gives you hope.
4801;I certainly hope that it's not too late.
4802;For a movie that has no specific message to convey, Brokeback Mountain gave me lots of thoughts about life and love, and surely, it renewed my hope.
4803;I was greatly moved by the movie and I was inspired to write.
4804;is such a great film that motivates people.
4805;Seeing other people's reviews here makes me shed some tears because I completely understand their feelings in what they have written.
4806;It's all about telling a good story and how that story reaches the heart and mind of the audience.
4807;that's the way I evaluate a film.
4808;This review basically reveals how the movie left me a lasting impression.
4809;The grandness of the landscape and the simplicity of the sheep in the area controlled by cowboys also symbolized our big world and the little souls living in it constrained by the society's norms and values.
4810;This was a perfect illustration of his love left undisclosed to Jack.
4811;Because of a true love which was not supposed to be.
4812;While I was deeply sympathetic with Alma looking over the window at Ennis and Jack getting in the pickup, at the same time I was also happy for the two guys being together again.
4813;Proving that their love for each other still exist after all those years.
4814;Ang Lee knows what he was doing.
4815;this movie is brilliant, if not perfect.
4816;he created an unforgettable character whose silent and mostly non.
4817;verbal expressions of internal conflict and pain shouts an ocean deep of emotion.
4818;My choice for best actor (over the guy who imitated another person who talks a lot and that talking just seemed to cover up what lacked in the acting itself).
4819;a peaceful movie with a more universal theme should have won the best picture at the Oscars (especially if this organization is trying to impress the world as the leading and international film award giving body) instead of the one that I find too American.
4820;The lead actors did a great, convincing job that if I happen to meet them personally I'm afraid that I would give them a big hug in tears, still believing that they are the doomed Ennis and Jack.
4821;Brokeback Mountain is too good that every time I watch it, it always penetrates into my heart.
4822;In other words, this movie offers a lot of meaningful interpretation.
4823;Have an open mind, see this movie and let your heart find the right answer for you.
4824;I rarely watch movies which are love stories/romance films.
4825;It is truly poignant and touching.
4826;It is also refreshing to see bisexual/gay men portrayed as masculine.
4827;The friendship and love between Ennis and Jack is palpable in this film.
4828;The trajedy of the societal constraints which keep them apart is achingly portrayed.
4829;Anne Hathaway played a good part.
4830;This movie also stars Linda Cardellini (Velma from Scooby.
4831;doo 1 and 2) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, and now 4).
4832;In Brokeback Mountain there were enough twists (pun intended) to keep it interesting.
4833;The directing and acting were exceptionally good.
4834;From what I could tell in the theater (lots of sobbing), Ang Lee did a great job at making the audience connect with these characters.
4835;With all of these elements are an absolutely amazing cast, particularly Heath Ledger, whom I never have cared for and now respect greatly.
4836;The passion between Jack and Ennis moves from understated and sensuous to fiery and palpable.
4837;The instrumental score is gorgeous.
4838;The only difference is the added scenes, which stem from references the characters make in the stories (birth of a son, Mexico trip, etc.).
4839;Annie Proulx writes on her website that she feels lucky to have her story adapted so beautifully.
4840;this is a stunning, gritty, beautiful, moving film.
4841;It's amazing what Ang Lee has done, how bold yet delicate the love story is.
4842;I was surprised by how the film handles its subject .
4843;He doesn't speak much
4844;Jack daydreams and hopes to achieve his vision of bullriding success.
4845;Nonetheless, they continue to indulge themselves.
4846;The emotions feel real, though, and there is a real sensitivity to what these men might have gone through.
4847;The acting from all four principals is very good, and Ang Lee's directing is perfect
4848;Great film, but be ready to struggle with your own emotions here.
4849;I thought this would be hard to watch, but it was a pleasant surprise.
4850;The scenery was very cool too.
4851;Bravo, to all the fine men and women, gay and straight, who have stood up for this beautiful movie.
4852;while there have been many excellent movies about relationships between men, they have often been semi.
4853;With Brokeback Mountain, we are seeing the same level of intelligence and sensitivity in a mainstream movie.
4854;The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful.
4855;full marks to the writer, the cast, and Ang Lee above all for their courage and vision.
4856;Charity: The RodeoI am a Gay Cowboy and proud!
4857;a 'love that has no boundaries'!
4858;I watched the movie and wanted to see it again as it really told the 'truth' of life on the range, though many 'homophobic' fundamentalists will always deny that something so true would ever be right or accepted as far as they're concerned!When it ended I was not the only one in tears!
4859;I resisted watching this film.
4860;At first I assumed it was a gimmick: a mainstream movie featuring breakthrough love scenes between gay men.
4861;I was wrong on both counts, and Brokeback turns out to be the best movie of the year.
4862;It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.
4863;putting, but they were genuinely touching.
4864;Affection was easier for Jack, and it was especially heart.
4865;warming to see Ennis emerge from his shell.
4866;brokeback is a bittersweet tale of the redeeming power of love, as well as the sometimes desperate struggle for love and against loneliness.
4867;I have to give credit to the actors, they did an excellent job.
4868;But I do feel that the relationship between the two characters, Jack and Enis, was a bit.
4869;I actually baught the movie before seeing it in good faith that it was going to be beyond my expectations.
4870;Simply put, this is a love story.
4871;Heath Ledger is especially good, giving a performance that's astonishing for the way it communicates so much with so little.
4872;The film is worth seeing for him alone.
4873;Those who've seen the film numerous times disagree, arguing that every scene, every shot, is filled with layers of symbolism and resonant meaning.
4874;So perhaps this is a film you need to see several times to appreciate fully.
4875;Notwithstanding that context, from the moment Jack and Ennis connect, the possibility of some kind of life together is constantly on offer as far as Jack is concerned .
4876;Brokeback Mountain is the love story of a lifetime.
4877;Cinematic beauty and two people who end up falling in love.
4878;It doesn't matter if it's two men it is love between two people and caring for someone is a wonderful thing to find in life as so many never truely do.
4879;This is a beautiful, powerful and heartbreaking story of Ennis and Jack, two men who fall in love in the early 60's in rural America.
4880;while Brokeback Mountain is about two men who experience a gripping and overwhelming physical and emotional love for each other, it could have also been about an interracial couple, or any other type of taboo coupling of people, during the same time period.
4881;story aside, the movie is also beautifully filmed and directed, and the acting is top rate.
4882;Heath Ledger gives an unforgettable performance as the troubled and fearful Ennis.
4883;I bought before seeing it.
4884;But I love gay man.
4885;Because I feel so strong about gay man I knew I would like this movie before seeing it.
4886;I wasn't wrong, this is a great love story.
4887;They both found each other again and every so months they got together to show their love for each other.
4888;I don't believe there was any more sex scenes but you can see how much they care for each other.
4889;Extremely well portrayed and acted.
4890;Ang Lee at his best, along with magical performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
4891;it is every bit as haunting, heart.
4892;It has a deeper message and meaning that is as powerful and clear to me as a lightning bolt.
4893;In essence, it's a story about how we choose to live our lives.
4894;And, everything else aside, it is the heart and soul of this story/movie.
4895;It's great to see Hollywood finally show what life for hard working men in desolate areas is like when they are unable to be in the company of women.
4896;I will never be able to look at a guy in a cowboy hat the same way.
4897;This is the movie that should have won the Oscar as best film of 2005!
4898;We used to look to the Academy Awards to set trends, awaken people to social issues, and tell breathtaking tales of unrequitted love.
4899;It matters that 2 people love.
4900;This movie is painful in its beauty and substance.
4901;It is by far one of the best films I have had the privilege of viewing.
4902;I left the theatre sobbing and humbled by two men who could portray such a strong passion for each other despite the odds.
4903;I was truly touched by this movie, even though at some parts I wanted to fast forward because the plot slowed down.
4904;The cinematography was superb, Ang Lee did us Wyomingites proud (even though this is filmed in Canada).
4905;Homosexuality is a taboo and Ennis had realistic thoughts about Jack and himself living together.
4906;i have heard all the hype about the movie (both positive and negative) and I have seen all the trailers and promo videos.
4907;I understand what it means to love so deeply and be denied the freedom of expression of that love because of how one is 'expected' to behave.
4908;The concept of this movie (based upon the short story) is so groundbreaking and beautiful that I can honestly say, without having watched the movie itself, that I consider this the best movie of this decade.
4909;Nothing has touched me so deeply, so profoundly, with nothing but a glimpse of the entire work.
4910;Ang Lee does an absolutely fantastic job with his character's development and the astounding scenery in which this all happens.
4911;The bond that both of our lead characters have is truly beautiful and pure.
4912;The character driven story is held by a tremendous young cast of actors.
4913;Gyllenhaal puts himself up there to become a great leading man in Hollywood, Anne Hathaway has become the new Reese Witherspoon and in time assuming she stays on track will become a leading force.
4914;Finally Heath Ledger, by far one of the most powerful performances he has ever produced.
4915;A complex, engrossing portrayal, Ennis presents himself as a more conventional male stereotype than Jack, so the tension between his masculinity and his sexuality is all the more demanding.
4916;A career best from nearly the whole cast.
4917;the characters Ennis and Jack, superbly played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the absolutely stunning directoral work done by Ang Lee, and the heartwrenchingly beautiful musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla, have all been swimming in my head and heart nonstop these last few days and nights.
4918;I have been profoundly affected by this film.
4919;I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story.
4920;there is so much passion in this movie it really touched your heart.
4921;if you watch this movie and all youget out of it is 2 guys having sex then you need to watch closer and appreciate the message and the passion that movie is portraying, i give the writer props fro writing such an amazing movie!!!
4922;There are many great movies.
4923;there are a lot of great directors who made terrific films.
4924;There are also many great actors, wonderful screenplayers and screenplays, scores, songs and so on.
4925;it is the first time that a love between two men is the main focus in a movie (just, and only just, as a fact).
4926;Annie Proulx had written an extraordinary heart.
4927;Without any doubt this is the best movie I have ever seen.
4928;It is always interesting to see how non.
4929;This is an extremely touching movie and I wasn't really expecting that.
4930;the theme music is beautiful and haunting.
4931;I was moved to tears more than once.
4932;It hit me like a ton of bricks after I got home.
4933;This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen.
4934;When a movie can make you feel an overabundance of emotions it's doing it's job.
4935;Their time together also makes them realize their fondness for one another and thus a love affair is born.
4936;To me the greatest love story ever told begins at this point.
4937;with beautiful scenery ( the film was shot near Calgary, Alberta, Canada), an excellent script, superb directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful performances especially by Heath Ledger who puts on the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, Brokeback Mountain has everything a film should have.
4938;it's been many years since a film from Hollywood has explored the sensitive subject of homosexuality.
4939;The last film that I saw that was superb in dealing with this was Making Love, and what I like about Brokeback is that gay men are depicted as normal average Americain men.
4940;thank you Ang Lee and the other's associated with the making of this film and most of all Heath Ledger
4941;For the very first time in my life I am proud to be a gay man after viewing your performance.
4942;of picture postcards of the stars of this beautiful film that are suitable for framing.
4943;more from this seller as great gifts.
4944;And the movie itself is wonderful.
4945;I can't tell you how much I love this movie.
4946;Still, it's an important topic that at least got attention, thanks to a great director and a wonderful cast.
4947;Did you see Jake's expression when Crash won??
4948;I cried when they laughed.
4949;This movie touches your heart like non.
4950;This movie gives you the joys of being a rancher and a cowboy without all the glitter and the props.
4951;It takes real acting, fantastic acting, to have two competely straight men in real life have the sexual tension and longing that Jake Gyllenhaal and (R. i. p.) Heath Ledger possess so beautifully.
4952;This is a movie for the ages and I would recommend it to anyone who has a deep passion for love and great films.
4953;It's up for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, and it's getting great reviews everywhere.
4954;Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal tear up the screen as two men who start a forbidden romance unbeknownst to their wives.
4955;Brokeback Mountain is the best film to come out in many a year.
4956;Script and screenplay were excellent .
4957;Directing unblemished ,actors were actors to the core, and did a wonderful job of putting across the heart breaking , gut wrenching love that could not be satisfied by their distance from each other, but even with that distance they had each other for 20 some years , and that in itself shows their love for each other as not just being physical, but on the level of soul.
4958;as every muscle in your body yearns for the sight of that loved.
4959;Ennis and Jack had that forbidden love for each other and it played out like the great love affair it was .
4960;But the truth is, Brokeback Mountain is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.
4961;Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.
4962;What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40.
4963;Still, Brokeback Mountain is a beautifully told movie than lingers in your head long after the final credits roll.
4964;It is a meditative, thoughtful, well paced and shot, romance.
4965;Brokeback Mountain is a real testament to the fact love can definitely be found in the very unlikeliest of places and between the unlikeliest of people.
4966;Overall Brokeback Mountain is a very daring and stereotype destroying outing for all parties involved.
4967;Whether it's your thing or not Brokeback Mountain is a meaningful and enduring film.
4968;i have watched it four times since I bought it and it just keeps getting better.
4969;i so want a love like that.
4970;as such, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film of enormous universal appeal, which no doubt explains why the film is profoundly touching diverse audiences everywhere.
4971;though not technically perfect, the film actually achieves much more than being a mere exercise in cinematic polish: it is genuinely moving, deeply compassionate, poignant, tender, gripping, and superbly intelligent.
4972;'Brokeback Mountain' in also incredibly nuanced in every manner possible.
4973;the manner in which Ennis and Jack express their passion for one another is incredibly moving, since their attraction is primarily an expression of emotional desire and deep longing rather than a matter of strictly physical attraction.
4974;'It's probable that the film's brief last line, hauntingly delivered by Ledger, will go down in film history, since it allows Ennis to finally express, as best he is able, everything he has felt for Jack over several decades in three terse, surging, terribly sad words.
4975;with the exception of children, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film for all audiences.
4976;It's a grand thing to actually discover a mature, intelligent film that is 'adult' in the best sense of the word, which is also profound and highly enjoyable.
4977;'Brokeback Mountain' has proven to have a kind of healing power over its many of its viewers, and thus is a film all audiences potentially gain from seeing.
4978;The movie is truly thought.
4979;provoking and the fact that many people from all over the world could see and relate to this movie is great.
4980;Cast, cinematography, music, script and directing, they all come together to form a unique experience.
4981;See, Hollywood can, *sometimes* make something original and daring.
4982;Brokeback Mountain succeeds in that enterprise.
4983;during the film we are swept up by the drama and emotion of the story.
4984;This is a very awesome movie, I watched it six times in the first week of having it.
4985;When true love happens it crosses over sociey's expectations into a world of soul.
4986;A movie that all adults and mature young adults should study as a springboard to understanding the diversity of our self.
4987;One day, Jack rolls into town and the two lovers share a romantic weekend.
4988;perhaps the best things about the film are the performances by the two leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.
4989;But in Brokeback, he is able to create a fully realized character, a character we can believe in and identify with
4990;As the relationship and their lives become more complicated, Ledger helps us understand why Ennis believes the way he does.
4991;The relationship he builds with Jack starts as a confused coupling due to need and grows into something more profound and deep, at least through Ennis' eyes.
4992;The character is very complicated, and interesting to watch, and a lot of this is due to Ledger's performance.
4993;It is intense, interesting and riveting.
4994;jake Gyllenhaal is also very good.
4995;Gyllenhaal's performance is so good because it hints at things we never learn for sure.
4996;Is Ennis his first love?Director Ang Lee has an impressive resume of films.
4997;If you look at his diverse group of films, you realize that he is willing to try to new things and (usually) does them very well.
4998;From Jane Austen's England, to New England in the 80s, from modern day San Francisco to modern day New York, he seems to have a real sense for the time and place in each film's narrative.
4999;He uses great actors, great writing and great cinematography to fully realize each film.
5000;the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, based on a story by E. Annie Proulx, captures the dialogue of the time and place brilliantly.
5001;His dreams of living a happy life with Ennis are all the more heartbreaking, because we realize they will never happen.
5002;What they added was an elaboration on the domestic life of Ennis and Jack, detailing what life is like for each when they aren't together.
5003;Ennis' life is the more captivating of the two because we recognize how troubled and horrible his life with Alma is.
5004;Perhaps the best moment in the film happens when Alma realizes what Jack and Ennis do on those fishing trips.
5005;Even in the time and place, despite their confusion, they still manage moments alone, yet we don't really get a sense of the physical side of their love.
5006;Brokeback Mountain is a film filled with great performances, outstanding dialogue and beautiful cinematography.
5007;It will surely earn a handful of Oscar nominations.
5008;Brokeback Mountain is a rare movie that portrays gay men realistically, perhaps one of the very few American Movies to do so.
5009;to that extent, Heath Ledger completely captures the fear and self.
5010;but Brokeback Mountain is, again, of much greater substance than that.
5011;The script is an incredible, almost flawless economy of words and nuance.
5012;laws, most notably), with many of the key passages are lifted verbatim.
5013;And that is a good thing.
5014;perhaps more than the terrific script is that all the principle actors execute their parts so perfectly.
5015;But saying that it's just a cheater's movie is like saying that Hamlet is just a ghost story.
5016;again, the triumph of Brokeback Mountain is its great story about the tragedy of an unrealized life.
5017;Funny how something this honest yet true gets hypocritically slammed and ranked from certain theaters, when gratuitous violent swill like Hostel enters moviehouses with an R. Everyone involved with Brokeback Mountain, from Director Ang Lee to even the cinematrographers (who do a great job of making Canada look like the American Mid.
5018;the story is worth seeing.
5019;This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time.
5020;The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.
5021;That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions.
5022;as a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations.
5023;the acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding.
5024;communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family will tug at your heart and your mind.
5025;Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time.
5026;the female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential.
5027;It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages.
5028;This superb and superlative movie is one of the saddest and most uplifting I have seen in a very, very long time.
5029;The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.
5030;That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions.
5031;as a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations.
5032;the acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding.

5035;the female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential.
5036;It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages.
5037;I thought it was going to be about two lonely young men finding each other in friendship.
5038;I remember thinking what an amazing film this would make, but that it never would get made.
5039;well, at least he was good in Monster's Ball and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko as Jack Twist?
5040;I had incredibly high expectations.
5041;the spare, but powerful, little story had been transformed into an archtypal tragedy of repressed love.
5042;Unlike many of the other reviewers, I thought that their growing attraction was fairly obvious, and as they began to open up to each other an intimacy grew, slowly and cautiously leading up to that first encounter in the tent.
5043;This movie kicks you in the guts, then gets under your skin and stays there for a very long time.
5044;ang Lee is a master, but this is his best work thus far.
5045;He's created a film that tells a story in silences and glances rather than words, an extremely emotional film that somehow manages never to cross the line into sentmentality.
5046;The emotional impact is greatly enhanced by Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous, but nuanced, cinematography (trivia bit, that's him in the Mexico scene) and Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting score and wonderful country music selections.
5047;i LOVED THE SHORT STORY, and Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana have done probably the best adaptation in cinematic history.
5048;finally, the cast are uniformly superb.
5049;Anne Hathaway is perfect as Jack's wife Lureen.
5050;Ennis' wife Alma, wonderfully played by Michelle Williams, actually knows what's going on, yet doesn't confront Ennis for years, and long after divorcing him.
5051;Jack is a quixotic character, mercurial, optimistic, and earnest, and Gyllenhaal plays him like a finely tuned violin.
5052;but Heath Ledger carries this entire film on his shoulders.
5053;Yet when he's with Jack, he allows himself to open up, and gradually allow himself to become intimate with another person.
5054;Folks, this is the real deal.
5055;The transformation was total, breathtaking acting at its best.
5056;Brokeback Mountain is an amazing movie for many reasons .
5057;the amazing directing, soundtrack, and cinematography .
5058;but what sets it apart from so many other movies being made right now is the acting.
5059;He brings such realism to his character
5060;Gyllenhaal shows the vulnerability of his character .
5061;jake Gyllenhaal is wonderful in this movie, but Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is literally beyond words.
5062;This is the best film of 2005, and most critics agree.
5063;It is such an honest portrayal of two people's love for each other.
5064;the breathtaking cinematography alone is oscar.
5065;Then you have the masterpiece short and simple story transformed to the big screen effortlessly.
5066;Heath Ledger could have won best actor for his portrayal of the cowboy whose emotions were so far bottled up inside him that he could barely speak.
5067;Both are at the beginning of very long and fruitful careers if this is a part of what they are capable of.
5068;See the movie, especially if you are hetero, because for 2 hours you may see the best film ever made about two men in love, and some of the challenges it can bring.
5069;This is an outstanding movie and sad story about two cowboys who fall in love with, of all people, each other.
5070;But both continue to long for such a life with each other.
5071;This movie is highly recommended, IF you're ready for it.
5072;It was a very interesting, well done movie about a tough subject to write or film about.
5073;This film's power is in the performances , cinematography , directing , and the unforgettable acting.
5074;It was well recieved and was in fact nominated for 8 Academy Awards.
5075;hollywood has done everything a million times.
5076;Isolated , lonely , young , and reliant on each other in the rugged wilderness , the two begin a love affair that spans the rest of the their lives.
5077;Ang Lee does a phenominal job at directing , Rodrigo Prieto does an unforgettable job as the film's cinematographer and Gustavo Santaolalla provides a musical score that will always be remembered in a haunting connection to the film.
5078;Brokeback Mountain  is an unforgettable film , and I highly recommend it.
5079;It does contain nudity , strong sexual content , violence and strong profanity and I don't recommend it for viwers under 18.
5080;quiet subtlety is Brokeback Mountain's greatest asset.
5081;The majority of what is going in is expressed in the characters faces, actions, and simple but effective dialogue.
5082;Jake Gyllenhaal is nearly as good as Jack, who impatiently wades through his life, waiting for the happiness he knows must be around the corner.
5083;brokeback Mountain is a magnificent story of men doomed by impulses they would each rather not possess.
5084;The fresh air must have been very stimulating.
5085;Here the place where Ennis and Jack's love is born.
5086;A love so clear and beautiful, so endless and eternal like the sky at the beginning of the movie.
5087;brokeback shows us the romantic side of the Wild West.
5088;It's a great American story that had to be told and it's a master class in subtle direction.
5089;The only thing great w/ this movie is the cinematography.
5090;No matter which way you roll, straight or otherwise, this is one of the best love stories since Romeo and Juliet.
5091;It truly deserved to win an Academy Award, and it not winning (partly because some Academy voters never even saw it) is just another case and point example of narrow.
5092;This movie is simply beautiful.
5093;The young actors give performances that rival the best.
5094;The scenery is, of course, georgeous, and the story by Annie Proulx is top.
5095;It is for people who have loved, and lost, regardless of their sex, color, race or age.
5096;i will see this movie in the theater a few more times .
5097;because I am taking various friends to see it as well.
5098;one has to approach the film with as much maturity as those who created it, and that is not easy, but well worth it if you do.
5099;If you do, you will see yourself in the characters, I guarantee.
5100;it takes a lot of consideration for me to pay for a film at the cinema, and I can usually tell if a film is going to be any good, or at least something to which I can relate or enjoy.
5101;The story is poignant (look for the brilliant symbolism).
5102;Crash technically was chosen, and maybe it's a good film, but I hadn't even heard of it until a week ago.
5103;It's a higher honour than the Oscar.
5104;A real culutral breakthrough topic.
5105;This is an amazing film.
5106;Despite the small minded bigots who can no longer openly hate Blacks and/or Women, and who now channel their petty hate towards homosexuals, the success of this film speaks for itself in the minds and hearts of Americans and people worldwide.
5107;The film is about love.
5108;And it will remain a noble and triumphant film about love for the rest of time.
5109;This motion picture is habit.
5110;forming to an extensive degree.
5111;I watch it every day, sometimes twice or three times in the same day.
5112;This is a powerful film that captures the pain in human existence so well.
5113;Brokeback Mountain is a modern tradgedy that connects with an experience of life of which everyone has gotten a taste.
5114;See this movie and allow yourself to experience its pain.you'll feel more alive for it.
5115;Relationship drama is always Lee's strength and the move to direct the Hulk movie could be regarded as one of the biggest mistakes in his directing career.
5116;Wedding Banquet is one of his major successes.
5117;In Brokeback Mountain, two guys deeply in love in a forbidden age within a forbidding profession.
5118;Jake Gyllenhaal plays brilliantly as the part of Jack, who in his whole life try to make the relationship work at all cost.
5119;michelle Williams showcasted a power performance as Ennis' wife, who accidentally discovered her husband's real love.
5120;brokeback Mountain certainly marks a performance of an outstanding cast with an outstanding story.
5121;The dialogues are so well written that they completely and tightly tie the plot together.
5122;Jake Gyllenhall once again proved that he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood.
5123;It is wonderful to see Ang Lee come back with `Brokeback Mountain,' beautifully.
5124;rending drama about two cowboys and their forbidden love.
5125;Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too.
5126;The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain,Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children.
5127;and the film covers about 20 years of their life .
5128;first and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack.
5129;Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers.
5130;Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past.
5131;female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis.
5132;Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC.
5133;born actress is miscast as Texas girl.
5134;Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.
5135;Heath Ledger does an amazing transformation performance.
5136;A very reserved, quiet young man raised in the back roads amongst pain and prejudice.
5137;a man who has gained strength simply by enduring while avoiding becoming another of the perpetrators.
5138;what Lee uses is a mixture of passion and brutality to depict their early relationship, but does that actually reveal their deep affection?
5139;Maybe their interiors are so tightly bound up by exteriors of cultural and self.
5140;There are moments in this tale, though, when you see it really is about love, just basic love.
5141;the level of drama in this film is exceptional.
5142;This is very sophisticated story telling using the film medium.
5143;The depiction of the west/midwest here is deep and very convincing.
5144;What a great Poetic transition!There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind.
5145;Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is sleeping like a horse.
5146;Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town.
5147;Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.
5148;i could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie.
5149;trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front.
5150;But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.
5151;I got it 2 days later than an actual date showed there.
5152;I totally love the movie, and everything is perfect when I received it.
5153;I totally fall in love with this movie and it has excellent price too!
5154;Down through the years, they get together twice a year, for some rest and relaxation.
5155;I bought it off amazon.
5156;com because I'd loved to be able to watch it whenever I wanted to.
5157;The profound truths in these pithy expressions are so inviting and eternally fresh that any attempt for explanation not only seems superfluous, but dilutes and degrades as well.
5158;Simply put, it's a movie that love is conquered and lovers are consumed and all this is made possible only under the careful direction and watchful eyes of Ang Lee, an amazing individual whose appreciation for humanity and superb ability to translate that appreciation faithfully into the silver screen will unequivocally peg himself among that rare species of gifted few who had ever bestowed a modern Olympia into the hearts of the viewing public.
5159;This gripping movie, therefore, testifies *VULNERABILITY* of mankind in general.
5160;Lee, first and foremost, was simply stunned and has been captivated ever since by the purity, strength and depth of this kind of male bond.
5161;As far as the art form of motion picture goes, by now, Lee is definitely a true master, sensitively and versatile, with piercingly keen eyes and a big warm heart.
5162;Its not an explicit film, it is all done extremely well and directed beautifully and tastefully.
5163;Ang Lee is a favorite of mine, especially after Sense and Sensibility.
5164;Brokeback Mountain is easily another score for him.
5165;It really is a beautifully touching movie.
5166;Everyone wants a happy ending but sometimes, Its just not possible.
5167;And because of the maturity of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, its a very realistic and believable film.
5168;Those actors took a risk and it worked.
5169;Having said that, I thought Brokeback Mountain was fantastic.
5170;This might possibly be the best film I've seen in the theaters so far in 2006, and after watching the film, I spent weeks on end thinking about the content of the film.
5171;Great movies have a way of making viewers do that.
5172;The film actually made me rethink and reconsider a lot of the stereotypes that I held towarards homosexuals, and Brokeback Mountain is an important and timely film.
5173;everyone I know who saw this film in the theater thinks it is phenomenal.
5174;There is great acting, and the cinematography is breathtaking: herds of sheep flocking about the screen, the mountains and lakes of the Rocky Mountains, and the rugged terrain and cornfields of Texas.
5175;The plot is fantastic, and the movie is an overall success.
5176;The acting is superb, the scenery is stunning, and the emotion is so raw, it really tugs the heart strings.
5177;I didn't necessarily think that it was the greatest love story of all time, or that the movie was the best film ever made, but for what it is, it's definitely a triumph that breaks boundaries, hopefully allowing the film industry to broaden their horizons and touch upon deeper and untouched territory that we shouldn't necessarily hide or be afraid of.
5178;This truly is a great story.
5179;the acting is brilliant from everyone in this film!
5180;It's a story about love.
5181;A story about how you should always be true to yourself and the one you love.
5182;It sounds simple, but it's far from simple, and this movie proves that.
5183;this movie is beautiful and tragic.
5184;It's a great story, and it'll stand the test of time.
5185;C'est le film le plus prim de 2005.
5186;This is a sweet surprise of a movie.
5187;I was delightfully surprised by the emotional sweep and characters portrayed in this movie.
5188;It holds very true to the book and improves in the telling of the tale.
5189;Myself included and I firmly suggest that you bring tissues with you.
5190;It takes your breath away.
5191;The film is so powerful and so beautiful.
5192;It is a devastating love story between two human beings.
5193;It takes your breath away.
5194;The film is so powerful and so beautiful.
5195;It is a devastating love story between two human beings.
5196;An extremely poignant movie of frustrated love, with brilliant acting and incredible cinematography.
5197;Ang Lee did a wonderful job, it's amazing to think his movie before this was 'Hulk'.
5198;Heath Ledger was particularly strong in his role and in another year probably would have won the best actor Oscar.
5199;A beautifully crafted film with excellent performances from the whole cast, especially Ledger.
5200;A tragic love story as well, and I'm impressed with how closely the screenplay follows the short story.
5201;How is it, that the rest of the world can see how beautiful this movie is and you can't?
5202;Brokeback Mountain instantly became my favorite movie before I had moved from my seat to leave the theater.
5203;The scenery is amazing, Ang Lee creates a masterpiece.
5204;Westerns and their cowboys are a huge part of cinematic history, and the epitome of a man.
5205;It's brilliant, and if you had ever seen Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhaal act before, you might realize this movie represents incredible breakout performances for both.
5206;I think the movie is easy to fall in love with, powerful in the way it's love story unfolds, and an all around inspiring movie.
5207;As a movie aficionado, I make a practice of seeing films that pique the intellect, the imagination, and the heart.
5208;Everyone involved deserves kudos for sweeping courage.
5209;I waited till 10/2006 to watch this movie for the first time, allowing time to pass between the hype and the actual film.
5210;The viewing was well worth the wait.
5211;I found the characters engaging and believable to a fault.
5212;Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful love story for our time.
5213;It is superbly scripted, sensitively directed, beautifully filmed, with inspired acting and a message that all Americans need to hear.
5214;It is the film that should have won Best Picture from the Academy.
5215;confirms the majesty and brilliance of Ang Lee's direction and deserved Best Directors Award from the Academy.
5216;The first 'male sex' experience for Ennis in the tent is raw, intense, shocking and beautiful all at the same time.
5217;The first kiss between Jack and Ennis is tender, gentle and sensual.
5218;both are capable of loving.
5219;out important work and contribution to art, film and literature, alike.
5220;it started beautifully with some deliberately iconic scenes and poses, framed within the context of but to shatter the Gary Cooper/Shane mystique.
5221;making it that much more powerful in its quiet restraint, which to a large extent describes this film.
5222;Elegant as it is, this film slowly, systematically tears you apart, leaving you feeling as barren, ragged and yet as moved as the characters.
5223;the acting from every single character is true.
5224;I think Michelle Williams' performance is a spectacular revelation, who knew that a second banana from a teen melodrama series could act with such depth and restraint and emotional power.
5225;And Anne Hathaway has a tremendous moment towards the end
5226;The performances in this film are truly the best I've seen by a group of actors.
5227;Each of the characters breaks your heart, one by one.
5228;That Jake and Heath convey the love and pain these two men felt is a testimony to their acting ability.
5229;The weakest performance, Jack's wife, is still a pretty good one.
5230;The sweeping and beautiful cinematography is overshadowed only by the scenes of intimacy between the characters.
5231;The music alone will draw out your tears.
5232;com.Yes, it is a great movie.
5233;Heath Ledger as Ennis especially does an amazing job of conveying the pain that is exacted from repressing his love for another man.
5234;The film is to be commended for allowing that kind of ambiguity to exist.
5235;heath Ledger and Michelle Williams (who plays his wife Alma) do a really impressive job together of showing how corrosive a competing passion can be to a relationship that starts out with love, respect, and even some attraction.
5236;I believed most fully in Jack's and Ennis's love when I saw how eager Ennis was to leave his wife and go off fishing with his lover.
5237;The film understands that passion always exists in a social context.
5238;But I actually got a more developed sense of love between men from watching the interesting domestic relationship of Truman Capote and Jack Dunphy (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bruce Greenwood) in the film Capote (which I personally think should have won best film) than I got here, even though there was no kissing in that movie.
5239;Don't get me wrong: It's a very good film.
5240;the ensemble is perfect showing the ability for each person to flesh out their responses to relationships straight or gay that are mired by limitation.
5241;Ang Lee's work will be a landmark movie for eons to come.
5242;i feel Crash will be considered a lesser movie,and people will be questioning why this epic earned best director,and why it didn't get recognition for the most engaging film of the year.
5243;aNYWAY, that may kind of seem like unnecessary info but it's pertinent to my comments, in that this movie made me feel emotional and *GASP!
5244;_That_ is how I know a movie is good, when it doesn't just touch me (like many a movie has in the past), but touches me to where my emotional block almost gives way.
5245;That's the part that gets me the most!
5246;That is one of the things that makes this movie memorable, and reminds me that love is a wonderful thing that is worthy of chasing no matter what the odds, even though serious risks my be present.
5247;i suspect this movie is more affecting and more relatable with a new meaning and significance, to homosexuals, esp.
5248;I haven't gone through Ennis and Jack's plight, but I can sure relate to a lot of things about the story!Crash may have won the Best Picture, and Crash is a good movie for sure, that also affected me and made me think, but I highly agree that it should have taken second place to this amazing movie.
5249;And, it shows that love between two men is just as beautiful and wonderful as love between a man and a woman, no matter who or what both men are.
5250;Hope that my 2 cents worth is worth something!
5251;some are awakened by it.

5280;I am speechless at the utter brilliance of this beautiful movie, which I had missed in the theaters, to my great regret.
5281;Having read Annie Proulx's short story from which the movie was taken first, I can testify to the movie's phenomenally accurate, delicate and moving translation into film.
5282;the intense unbreakable bond between Jack and Ennis examines the very essence of being human.
5283;incredible directing by Ang Lee, incredible writing, spectacular photography and acting (Heath Ledger is incredibly talented as Ennis, in what might be the role of his career, but all the actors are superb), and lush, gorgeous music are all part of the whole.
5284;brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.
5285;I thought Heath Ledger was excellent and was definitely his movie.
5286;It's a worthwhile movie to see if you are open minded and willing to set through a fairly long movie that tells it's story slowly.
5287;The cover art has it listed as a Four Star Collection.

5293;It ends with the two destined to never see each other again.
5294;In a search for truth and closure, one of the men seeks out the family of the other and hears how his lover used to speak of the love they shared.
5295;i liked this film more than I expected, but what I won't like will be the beast it will become.
5296;I'm sure many people are very eager to see the gay cowboy movie that's winning so many awards.
5297;But please remember that it's a small, leisurely.
5298;Being a cowboy was obviously a hard life and the best they can hope for is to get some steady ranch work.
5299;Four years passes before they see each other again
5300;So begins a 20 plus year relationship marked with yearning that will never be satisfied.
5301;to some audiences, this film will just be a gay love story.
5302;in all aspects, Brokeback Mountain is finely wrought.
5303;Ang Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard, and the cinematography is breath.
5304;The script is from Pulitizer winner Annie Proulx's fine short story and was adapted by another Pulitzer winner, Larry McMurtry.
5305;In many ways, the film's simple portrait of the West is similar to McMurty's work in classics such as Hud and The Last Picture Show.
5306;The supporting cast is uniformly good, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.
5307;He's likely to be nominated for an Oscar and perhaps even challenge Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) for the win.
5308;Indeed, it's likely that Brokeback Mountain will win more than a few Oscars this year, and it's most worthy of the attention.
5309;Raw and honest without being manipulative.
5310;This is a classic love story that will stay with you forever.
5311;This is one of those films.
5312;as for Jake his performance is so honest, so urgent.
5313;His need to be with Ennis is so powerful that he'll risk everything.
5314;the rest of the cast is supurb and the story is faithful to the amazing short story.
5315;The direction from Ang Lee is as usual impecable and awe inspiring.
5316;it will break your heart but it will also remind why we risk our heart in the first place.
5317;For those few moments not where you're waiting to begin what is suppose to be the happy part of the rest of your life but the happy moments we have for just a moment with that one person we can't live without.
5318;Stunning scenery, gorgeous music, great acting.
5319;Brokeback Mountain is the most beautiful love story I've seen in many years.
5320;This film deserved all of the awards it achieved.
5321;I really liked how the story unfolded and was hooked at how the plot kept the story going.
5322;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
5323;In my view, Brokeback Mountain is the most meaningful and important film to be made in my lifetime.
5324;I lived over 75 years to see anything honest and real about gay men's lives in a movie.
5325;She and 3 children paid the price of societal intolerance when this happened.
5326;I find great comfort in that.
5327;Perhaps one of the best movies ever made.
5328;Concise, Intense, and all the actors performed incredibly well in the movie.
5329;Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern.
5330;Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch.
5331;This was one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in recent years.
5332;It should be seen by all, and particularly for the beautiful cinematography.
5333;Jake Gynenhaal, on the other hand, was simply brilliant and convincing throughout.
5334;overall, a fascinating, brilliant film but let down by Heath Ledger.
5335;Read all the reviews and finally had to add my two cents.
5336;it seems to get better with each viewing.
5337;I agree with all the positive reviews here.
5338;check out Heath and Jake's previous work, pretty impressive for a couple of 25 yr olds.

5340;and fated, as you will see if you watch the film.
5341;there is a great deal of tension between them from the film's beginning, when we first meet Ennis and Jack as they wait by the boss.
5342;Jack sees that Ennis is freezing and commands him to come inside the tent.

5344;This film gives us that lesson in painful yet memorable detail
5345;truly a man of his time.
5346;to the nearest cinema where this is playing, and see Brokeback Mountain.
5347;I've added to and slightly revised this review, and appended comments about the Blu.
5348;i've waited almost two years to review this film: it took me that long to work up the courage to watch Crash, the viewing of which seemed a prerequisite for my claiming any degree of objectivity or intellectual honesty in reviewing Brokeback.
5349;(I've posted a review of that film, as well.)
5350;I also wanted to be certain I'd found the right things to say and the right way to say them.
5351;There are so many things to discuss about Brokeback Mountain they could fill a book.
5352;But Woodrow F Call makes up for it.)
5353;the emotionally intimate relationships of Western males has been written about for a century and a half.
5354;because the truth it speaks about intense male friendships likely masks its truth about male sexuality.
5355;Clark's Bachin' extols the delights of a female.
5356;The implication is subtle, but Clark's writing shows such a consistently careful choice of words that it's difficult to read the meaning of and when dark found us limp and jaded otherwise.
5357;several Bret Harte stories express a startling homoeroticism.
5358;The men of Tennessee's Partner and In the Tules share a love for each other that's consummated only in the afterlife.
5359;When women aren't around (and sometimes when they are), they'll have it with each other.

5363;Brokeback Mountain speaks a truth many people want to suppress .

5368;but an iconic film is, by definition, great.
5369;a film with mixed reviews that appeared on few best.
5370;parallel could be drawn with the 1947 Best.
5371;picture winner, Gentleman's Agreement, an intelligent film about anti.
5372;picture nomination, let alone a win.
5373;Hollywood had the opportunity to award Best Picture to a film that truly deserved the honor, if only because it disrupted the usual order of things, and did it so well.
5374;The seeming naturalness of Ennis and Jack's attraction is arguably the most.
5375;cock The Duke in a fair fight.
5376;an appreciation for the male physique .
5377;She wants to spend time with someone who truly loved her son .
5378;i was surprised at Brokeback Mountain winning Best Score, as there is so _little_ score.
5379;It's probably the first film score to win an Oscar because of its non.
5380;bernard Herrmann famously said that the purpose of music is to establish an emotional connection between what's going on up on the screen and the audience .
5381;An outstanding example occurs in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit during the flashback of Gregory Peck killing a German soldier.
5382;Consider Ennis and Jack's reunion, their ecstatic embrace, and Alma's appalled reaction to seeing her husband kissing another man with more passion than he's ever shown /her/.
5383;on the rare occasions when the music does reflect the scene's affect, Santaolalla's scoring is spare, subtle, and unclich d.
5384;This is a remarkable score that shows, in an era where 70% or more of most films' running time is scored, how less can be more.
5385;The cinematographer normally lights the film knowing how what's front of the camera will translate to the final projection print.
5386;Aguirre's trailer office now looks relatively clean and neat, and Jack's family home not quite so dirty or run.
5387;I hope someday the director and cinematographer .
5388;will time each scene for the appropriate density, shadow detail, color saturation, etc.
5389;The BD images truly capture what it's like to stand outside on an overcast day, or the feeling one has in someone's living room or kitchen.
5390;ray transfer captures Ennis and Jack's environments very well.
5391;The Gilgmamesh / Enkidu relationship is intensely homoerotic and vehemently misogynistic.
5392;**** Richard Amory's classic Loon novels, though well.
5393;It's the work she will most.
5394;****** In If Chins Could Kill, Bruce Campbell offers high praise for Ernest Borgnine's professionalism.
5395;Crossfire was also about anti.
5396;Brokeback Mountain is a movie so ahead of our time that people are yet able to keep up with it.
5397;a few centuries ago, marriage is about power and benefits.
5398;Familys wed off their daughters to the rich and powerful so that they may receive the benefits of that marriage.
5399;Social classes are also very strictly governed, but eventually, human beings found that all people are equal, and abandoned the status system.
5400;But when the emotions are so strong, it will outgrow all social conditionings.
5401;This is absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen.
5402;It is superbly acted .
5403;Heath Ledger puts forth the best acting I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty!
5404;It portrays such an intense, palpable love, yet as I thought about it afterwards, I don't believe there is a single I love you uttered in the entire film.
5405;It is a movie, a piece of cinema work, and it should be reviewed just like a movie, with open mind.
5406;being a metro gay man myself, yes it is easier for me to feel the connection, yet most of my straight friends, male or female, think this is a really well made movie as well, forget about who agrees on the gay issue or not.
5407;The true matter is the movie is good.
5408;First of all, I am so relieved that I have finally seen this film after so much anticipation, and I was moved to tears as I had expected.
5409;It's such a treat to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger under the meticulous direction of Ang Lee.
5410;I agree with Lee that this film is a beautiful love story and not a gay cowboy movie.
5411;brokeback Mountain uses the beautiful mountain landscape of Alberta as a stand in for the Wyoming mountains.
5412;The two lonesome cowboys clashed at first, but eventual became friends and secret lovers.
5413;Jack is the sexy and rebellious one, and Ennis is emotionally and sexually confused.
5414;During those four years, they both got married and led a normal life, and had kids.
5415;Jack's feeling for Ennis grew stronger gradually, and suggested to move away and live together.
5416;The scene when Alma saw Ennis kissing and hugging Jack outside her house was so funny and shocking.
5417;She was mesmerizing when she had her heart.
5418;I enjoyed watching every scene between Jake and Heath.
5419;I actually like Jake's character more, because he knew what he wanted and was not afraid to love the man of his life.
5420;I was very moved by his final scene, which was kind of long, but the most dramatic between the two leads.
5421;It's Heath who actually got the most tear.
5422;jerking moments, and yes, his performance is compelling, and heartbreaking, especially the last fifteen minutes.
5423;ang Lee had done a great job making this film visually stunning and emotionally powerful, even though the love scenes are rather low.
5424;The cinematography captures the most beautiful images of the mountains, sheeps, rivers, and lakes.
5425;The original score and theme song are quite memorable.
5426;This film is going to have a huge following of gay audiences, but it's also a must.
5427;see for the mainstream crowds, because it's truly the year's most unforgetable romantic movie!
5428;i've never been moved as much by a film than I was with BBM.
5429;I love the fact that this isn't about two guys who meet up in the local gay bar whilst dancing away to Madonna.
5430;the key issue is the masculinity of the main characters' sexuality.
5431;Their masculinity defines their sexuality, and they love all things masculine and being masculine themselves.
5432;however, the real novelty is that the story is available to the public at large.
5433;This, in my opinion, is far more intense on the reader/viewer than any sex scenes, and far more novel (dare one say controversial, even?)
5434;spoken, stoic and reserved as any.
5435;the symbolism of the story is also great.
5436;The word Brokeback is open to many an interpretation.
5437;It's a wonder it hasn't been written before, but my praises go to Annie Proulx for having the courage to write it.
5438;This is a movie that grips the soul, stirs the emotions andtugs at the heart.
5439;The emotion and realism that was portrayed inthe acting was absolutely incredible.
5440;I think it pushed the boundaries and preconceptions of what we view love as and orhow it should be.
5441;The music, the scenery, and the storylineall made this movie a complete and moving experience.
5442;rate: acting, photography, musical score, editing, and Ang Lee's directing is over the top.
5443;I usually prefer wide screen editions, but found the full sreen edition to be just as good.
5444;It stands as one of the best love scenes ever made with superb acting by Gyllenhaal and Ledger set to that haunting theme.
5445;This is a beautiful and very sad film that visibly demonstrates the effects of a suppressed and secret passion.
5446;The cinematography, cast and music all contribute to a staggering emotional effect.
5447;I was expecting this movie to be overrated and kind of a chick flick, but it was actually really good.
5448;Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall gave outstanding performances.
5449;This was a good love story and you really feel for the characters.
5450;The acting, writing, and cinematography were all perfect.
5451;I was surpsied by Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams' acting ablities, they were great!
5452;This movie pretty much did everything right and lives up to the hype.
5453;They might be thrilling, interesting,cool etc., but hardly ever really emotinally touching.
5454;Ang Lee's powerful masterpiece should have gotten the award because it is uncompromising, revolutionary, and wholly original.
5455;At least Ang Lee got Best Director so it's not a total loss.
5456;Director Lee tackles a controversial subject and at the same time releases a beautifully filmed movie.
5457;I especially liked the closing song by Willie Nelson.
5458;I liked the concept, I liked the setting and I liked the love scenes.
5459;It was a good effort but not a great movie.
5460;I loved the cinematography and I thought Heath Ledger's performance was the most genuine, believable and less restrained out of the two.
5461;I liked the story of Boy's Don't Cry better.
5462;Confused individuals are ironically back in the closet again and it's time for another generation to learn AGAIN how to love themselves and live their authentic lives.
5463;Gay people need to be proud of who they are.
