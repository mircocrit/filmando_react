1;Pacino is fantastic as Tony Montana, and the story is interesting in how it shows the rise and fall of this person.
2;I loved the extras, though the Hip hop people's opinions on this movie were HILARIOUS to me.
3;i have always love the movie but the package and the way the deluxe box was put together was awesome!
4;And all I can say is wow!
5;special FeaturesThe special features are also very nice.
6;Also included is a comparison between the Network TV version of Scarface and the actual version, which is short but fun to watch.
7;It comes with many more things that make it worth the extra fifteen or twenty dollars.
8;Maybe I'm crazy, but I think the box itself is really neat, and bigger than it seems to look from Amazon's picture.
9;Paul Muni's performance as Tony Camonte was one of the most powerful protrayals of a gangster ever seen on screen.
10;The acting in both versions of Scarface are superb.
11;Tony Montana is a true legend of his time.
12;Truly a classic in its own time, Tony Montana is the Ultimate Gangsta Superhero and this is a real gangsta film, so Respect his Gangsta!!!
13;It is the greatest movie ever created!
14;Al Pacino did an amazing job acting.
15;I urge the whole world to watch this movie.
16;I had seen the 1983 film many times, so I dived right into the 1932 version before I watched the 1983 version.
17;While the 32 film is much shorter, it is every bit as good as the 83 film.
18;The difference between the 2 movies is the 32 film asks, What is the government doing about this?
19;Great set, and a great gift from a very good friend of mine.
20;Al pacino acted so good in Scarface, the cuban accent, the clothing design, the 1980's music, it was all good.
21;This movie is a masterpiece.
22;I've seen it hundreds of times, and each time it gets better.
23;I've been a Scarface face forever but never got to see the original.
24;=) Thanks to this product!
25;It also comes with the Scarface we all know and love too though.
26;Oliver Stones 1983 remake of the Howard Hawks classic.
27;culture trends are invading and raping every single medium of creative art.
28;If commercial pop rappers think Scarface is a cool movie, good for them.
29;"It leaves everything up to your imagination sort of like the classic Hitchcock movie, ""Psycho""."
30;I have to give credit to the superb acting.
31;This film has a couple of things against it.
32;This film is one of the most electric, intense, and violent films I ever saw.
33;It shows that remakes can be great.
34;This film is completely its own, really only using the title of the original and the same theme.
35;This film is far superior to the original, and is a work of art in many ways.
36;It had such an influence on hip.
37;Kudos to Oliver Stone who wrote the screenplay (people sometimes forget about that) and de Palma for making such an excessive masterpiece.
38;Pacino should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for one of his best roles.
39;This is probably his most memorable role, even though he's done great work elsewhere.
40;Product is excellent, certainly a great addition to any collection.
41;This Deluxe Gift Set of Scarface is a great to have for collectors!
42;If you have the money get the humidifier edition but this one is great for the price !!
43;The entire film is based along the same outline as the 1932 film with Muni.
44;Little guy gets in with a big guy, decides to make a name for himself, screws the big guy over, steals his woman, ends up having the world at his fingertips, goes nuts when he finds out his right hand man is all over his sister, dies a violent death.
45;That, I think, is a good capsule review of EITHER version of the film.
46;this is a great movie, just as the original was great in its time.
47;i got this for my brother for christmas as a gift.
48;he absolutly loved it and he loves everything that it came with
49;This Movie has it's merits, but as a gritty movie it's not a Masterpiece(I used to think it was).
50;He loved the American dream.

52;bucks and getting this set.

61;scarface is by far the best movie ever created.
62;the music in this movie is so perfect.
63;but the FACT, my friends, is that SCARFACE is the best movie ever released.
64;I bought the movie from Target at first and treasured it within my collection.
65;But I was always on the lookout for something more to celebrate this classic movie.
66;I found it at Sam's Club for $20, and I just had to have it!
67;When I first opened it, I was so excited.
68;I got this for my father in law since he's a big Scarface fan and he loved it!
69;For the lovers of Scarface, this edition has what you always wanted to see.
70;The Scarface special edition and the 1932 Scarface.
71;The whole package is impressive enough on the outside .
72;leather box (and the actual package box from Amazon, which the mailman brought in, was much, much larger .
73;Scarface ), and accompanied by an informative leaflet .
74;this, however, is just the first level of this treasure box, since, underneath .
75;this is a gift set for my brother in.
76;"riveting and immensely watchable film (hey
I:97;77;Tony Montana is so swaggering, showy and larger.
I:97;78;life a character, he manages to become a parody of himself within the confines of the film.
I:97;79;The 1932 version is simply timeless.
I:97;80;I really enjoyed this gift set, very nice.
I:97;81;This to me is one of the best if not the best Al Pacino movie.
I:97;82;I beleive it should have won an Oscar.
I:97;83;This is a brilliant acting job by my favorite actor Al Pacino.
I:97;84;This is the best gang movie ever.
I:97;85;Al Pacino makes a perfect lead role.
I:97;86;the deluxe gift set is worth your money.
I:97;87;It contains both Scarface movies (includuding the one by Howard Hughes) and 2 discs on the 1983 one and 2 discs on the Howard Hughes version.

I:97;91;birthScarface CreatingScarface ActingScarface TV Version MontageWhy didn't it also come with the f. bomb ticker and the shooting ticker?It also comes with this really nice slipcover and the film comes in DTS 5.1 which sounds really good, you got 8 lobycards and each one of them say """"He loved the American dream with a vengeance."""""""
92;My all time favorite Al Pacino movie!
93;This movie is a deffinet gem.
94;the storyline is great i mean great.
95;and if you havent seen it hurry up cuz this movie is great.
96;i ordered on Thursday and received it Monday using international courier, I live in Australia.
97;Everything in it was brand new and untainted.
98;Now he can actually use one and use the other for display.
99;Very cool Lithographs, with a nice Money clip, and awesome packaging.
100;Scarface has made a huge cultural impact over the years, starting with the 1983 debut.
101;While it really didn't impact many actors or film makers, it enthused an audience that loved the disturbingly violent and tragic life of being a gangster.
102;The violence barrier this film broke helped the entire action.
103;He was very happy with the perches.
104;I can understand him laying next to her for a few minutes.
105;I am a huge fan of Scarface (the older and the newer version).
106;Glad I was able to find.
107;the original 1932 classic starring Paul Muni was classic in it's own right for the time and era it debuted.
108;Paul Muni was a great actor, no question, his performance alone is worth the films enjoyment.
109;I can now see some of today's actors taking after this great man from his classic roles such as this.
110;Tony has made big impact in my life and the lesson, charisma, and downfalls he insued.
111;"all in all, you should own box set and enjoy it for years to come, it also comes with a set of Lobby Cards from the film and a gold Money Clip inscriped with the Tony Montana Logo and the slogan of both films ""The World is Yours""."
112;And like I said and very nice Collectible Box, that sort of reminds of something you keep cigar's or in the films case Yeyo in.
113;Scarface will always be a favorite of mine for years to come.
114;The movie that sneaks in to almost everyone's top 10 favorite movies.
115;My only question is, is the 1983 anniversary edition Scarface in widescreen or full screen?
116;One heck of a gangsta film!!!
