I:12654;1;"Walk the Line isn't just an admirable improvisation
I:12654;2;He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.
I:12654;3;There are other fascinating storylines available, too.
I:12654;4;"perenially, it has been said that the performances in ""Walk the Line"" are remarkable."
I:12654;5;The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.
I:12654;6;"It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the ""Folsum Prison"" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need."
I:12654;7;The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.
I:12654;8;While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.
I:12654;9;Walk the Line is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps).
I:12654;10;The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.
I:12654;11;The movie doesn't make a legend, but it certainly celebrates one.
I:12654;12;Excellent singing by both actors.
I:12654;13;Reese Witherspoon in wonderful as usual in this movie.
I:12654;14;The purpose of being able to submit a reivew on Amazon is to talk about the movie itself.
I:12654;15;this was a job well done by Reese and Joaquin and it is a great love story that is very interesting even if you know nothing about Johnny Cash!
I:12654;16;Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon leaves behind her blond dingbat roles to morph into Carter.
I:12654;17;For instance, my favorite scene, where Cash plays for Sam Phillips for the first time, is awesome and unforgettable .
I:12654;18;and there is a ton of stuff to enjoy .
I:12654;19;Awesome movie about the man in black.
I:12654;20;As you've heard, Phoenix and Witherspoon definitely earned their Oscar nominations .
I:12654;21;and do a great job sounding just like them singing.
I:12654;22;This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished.
I:12654;23;walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent.
I:12654;24;The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time.
I:12654;25;Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing.
I:12654;26;overall, this movie succeeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars.
I:12654;27;"One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a ""serious"" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo."
I:12654;28;All I can say after seeing this extraordinary film, is thank God I did!
I:12654;29;It's a remarkable love story about flawed but totally likable individuals.
I:12654;30;Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation in this film.
I:12654;31;He IS the man in black and he's so raw and vulnerable that it's as if Johnny Cash was reborn in him.
I:12654;32;"It's not just a good film
I:12654;33;Walk the line by Director James Mangold (I love all his movies) is a gorgeous tale of the love affair between Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;34;suited in their roles here.
I:12654;35;The film focuses mainly on how John and June met and toured together through the years and the start of their affair while he was still married to his first wife.
I:12654;36;Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much.
I:12654;37;derserved award for this talented actress.
I:12654;38;Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form.
I:12654;39;Walk the Line has solid writing, terrific acting, and a positive message that anyone know matter rich or poor can overcome old demons and survive.
I:12654;40;I think we called them falls and we added them to our own hair to make it look fuller.
I:12654;41;i thought Ginnifer Goodwin did a great job too.
I:12654;42;The chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix is what makes this work.
I:12654;43;The special edition has a wealth of extras.
I:12654;44;viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out.
I:12654;45;The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places.
I:12654;46;Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded.
I:12654;47;It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to.
I:12654;48;I like Johnny Cash and their was a great deal to the man, but the movie came up missing that critical essence of a very changed deeper person.
I:12654;49;It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them.
I:12654;50;Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it.
I:12654;51;"That ""d word"" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine."
I:12654;52;I am reviewing this nicely done commercial effort to delve into parts of the lives of the legendary singers Johnny Cash and his (eventual) wife June Carter Cash (of the famous mountain music Carter Family bloodlines.
I:12654;53;Her mother was the incredible vocalist and guitarist Maybelle Carter) in reverse order.
I:12654;54;okay, here is the skinny.
I:12654;55;Both are worth the time.
I:12654;56;Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.
I:12654;57;He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.
I:12654;58;Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.
I:12654;59;Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.
I:12654;60;Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.
I:12654;61;existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.
I:12654;62;chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self.
I:12654;63;Walk The Line tells the story of Johnny Cash from about age 12 up thru 1968.
I:12654;64;The movie is very well done.
I:12654;65;Phoenix does an incredible job, not only in portraying Cash but in singing his songs as well.
I:12654;66;He nails the mannerisms right down to the sideways smile.
I:12654;67;I really liked this movie.
I:12654;68;Also as with most bio.
I:12654;69;The movie tells the story of the man in black and his start in the music business.
I:12654;70;Along the way other various big names pop up, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Shooter Jennings playing his father Waylon.
I:12654;71;a great movie that is certainly Oscar worthy if for nothing else that for Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal.
I:12654;72;There's a lot of great music along the way!
I:12654;73;Seeing this movie you understand why.
I:12654;74;his facial expressions, voice and mannerisms i thought were spot on.
I:12654;75;he is a fabulous actor.
I:12654;76;he should have won the oscar.
I:12654;77;Cinematography, costumes, direction, casting, script, and, of course, the music.
I:12654;78;this is the kind of film everyone ever involved in motion pictures aspires to create.
I:12654;79;joaquin Phoenix can actually sing quite well.
I:12654;80;Joaquin's look and careful gestures brought a very genuine interpretation of the celebrity into the film.
I:12654;81;Reese Witherspoon is no less compelling as his partner and love interest June Carter.
I:12654;82;this biopic provides us with the bittersweet details of Cash's personal life, and it's a tale worth telling with a touch of drama here and there.
I:12654;83;This is the tale of a truly human hero.
I:12654;84;A good film, emotionally moving and powerful.
I:12654;85;Joaquin Phoenix did a good, brooding acting job as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was extraordinary as June Carter: strong, perky, principled, and loving, and a damned fine performer.
I:12654;86;handed, but the film was well.
I:12654;87;made and authentic in feeling if not always in look.
I:12654;88;With some movies that cover my early days, I feel the almost physical shock of recognition of the world I knew then.
I:12654;89;johnny Cash comes across as a man of grit, honesty, and persistence, capable of both compassion and great love, but also as a bastard with a mean streak a mile wide.
I:12654;90;He seems to have come by it naturally.
I:12654;91;I can also see it as arising from a sense of privilege.
I:12654;92;Joaquine Phoenix does a great job singing.
I:12654;93;Even my husband enjoyed it.
I:12654;94;My family really enjoyed this movie.
I:12654;95;The movie kept your attention.
I:12654;96;If you like Johnny Cash this is a movie to see.
I:12654;97;Shows you where he came from and how is got to where he was in life.
I:12654;98;The acting is superb and the screen writing is well crafted.
I:12654;99;The movie and it's story are a credit to all involved.
I:12654;100;Great testament to the memory of Mr. Cash.
I:12654;101;Of course the movie is totally saved by the incredible acting of Reese Witherspoon making this a very enjoyable journey through the trials and tribulations of the life of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;102;Looks and sounds great, adds great detail to the darker scenes and you can hear all of the soundtrack throughout your speaker system.
I:12654;103;Baby Boomers lived through the career of Johnny Cash and will experience the feeling that they are seeing history in the making.
I:12654;104;This film is extremely powerful.
I:12654;105;This film is worth owning.
I:12654;106;"His response, ""It's probably as good as Harry Potter."""
I:12654;107;If anyone chooses to make a sequel to this film, I'll be there.
I:12654;108;This film is good, but it is only part A of what should be a two.
I:12654;109;johnny Cash did great music, writing, performance, everything.
I:12654;110;that isn't to say the music wasn't first rate and really made the movie flow and there were also some great scenes showing a young Elvis and other stars that toured with Cash when he was first starting out and met Carter (played wonderfully by Reese Witherspoon).
I:12654;111;All the acting and singing was great.
I:12654;112;What we do see, however, and perhaps that's the story Cash really wanted us to see when he wrote his story (which was used to write the screen play) is that June Carter loved Cash and her love rescued him from a life of self imposed hell inflicted in many ways but most prominently through the abuse of pills.
I:12654;113;this next couple of sentences contain a couple of scenes from the movie, minor but perhaps spoilers, so skip if you'd like, anyway, I really thought the scene in which June takes John back to church was moving and it spoke volumes, it was very brief, however, in some way, it made the movie all tie together.
I:12654;114;In any case, that kind of loving friendship was what June offered Johnny and that's why this movie is really a great love story (in spite of the horrible back story and what is I'm sure still lingering pain in the children he had with his first wife).
I:12654;115;all that said, I highly recommend this movie, go see it on the big screen.
I:12654;116;It was a solid movie .
I:12654;117;"it kind of resembled a VH1 ""Behind the Music"" in that in chronicles the rise and fall of Johnny Cash, but it goes a lot deeper and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are very solid."
I:12654;118;I thought it was an inspirational story well played.
I:12654;119;I am not a big Reese fan, but she did a really good job portraying June Carter and Joaquin did an AMAZING job as Johnny.
I:12654;120;I was very impressed with the vocals through out the entire movie.
I:12654;121;I am a Walk the Line superfan.
I:12654;122;Yes, the price is high, but I think that the special features make it worth it.
I:12654;123;This edition also comes with several black and white postcards with Joaquin and Reese.
I:12654;124;This collector's edition is for anyone who really loved Walk the Line.
I:12654;125;I love the great acting and how it is a movie for the whole family to watch.
I:12654;126;I bought a few other movies from amazon at the same time and they were free shipping so it was well worth the money for the movies.
I:12654;127;Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.
I:12654;128;This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.
I:12654;129;The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.
I:12654;130;but it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;131;Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.
I:12654;132;The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.
I:12654;133;Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co. star.
I:12654;134;the supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.
I:12654;135;Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.
I:12654;136;Both Phoenix and Witherspoon created these characters brilliantly and beautifully.
I:12654;137;From the accurate sets to the costumes and stage performances `Walk the Line' is a fantastic biopic complete with acting bravado and a script that truly brings these legends to life.
I:12654;138;But thankfully enough no bias is needed to enjoy this film.
I:12654;139;The story of Johnny Cash is one of inspiration and perseverance.
I:12654;140;It's a rag to riches story and in inspirational picture that shows as long as you have passion for something, then anything is possible.
I:12654;141;The script is solid and well.
I:12654;142;The dialog and actions are true to life form for the body language and slang of the time.
I:12654;143;The recreation of the various venues and concerts are realistic and natural.
I:12654;144;James Mangold has created, by far, his best film.
I:12654;145;Reese looks absolutely adorable with the dark.
I:12654;146;In fact, not only Reese and Joaquin did a great job, but the whole cast from supporting roles to extras did a fantastic job.
I:12654;147;Though Joaquin Phoenix could have easily won the Oscar for best actor instead of Heath Ledger.
I:12654;148;one of my favorite parts of the film are the music scenes.
I:12654;149;It gives the film a taste of uniqueness and creativity.
I:12654;150;Surprisingly, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have a wonderful voice, and Phoenix had to learn the guitar from scratch for the role.
I:12654;151;To tell you the truth, I prefer Reese Witherspoon's voice compared to some of June Carter's work.
I:12654;152;walk The Line is the best film of the year.
I:12654;153;The acting and directing carry this movie to the far reaches of the heart.
I:12654;154;This film truly drawls the audiences compassion and care for Johnny and his ever dieing devotion to the sassy June Carter.
I:12654;155;His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.
I:12654;156;He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door.
I:12654;157;While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.
I:12654;158;"She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the ""real"" musicians."
I:12654;159;As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.
I:12654;160;While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.
I:12654;161;"Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves
I:12654;162;while I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.
I:12654;163;June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved.
I:12654;164;phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.
I:12654;165;Both of them nailed their characters so well.
I:12654;166;Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!
I:12654;167;Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.
I:12654;168;biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.
I:12654;169;It's got a great story as well as an amazing soundtrack.
I:12654;170;It has such a great story sand all the music is fantastic!
I:12654;171;Joaquin Phoenix has always graced this movie.
I:12654;172;since it's release this film has been great.
I:12654;173;Such a well done job in acting and telling Johnny's story.
I:12654;174;"reese Witherspoon stuns in this flick too
I:12654;175;Realistic without being too graphic or too painful but extremely touching and also fun to watch!
I:12654;176;I absolutely ADORE the film and Love Joaquin Phoenix.
I:12654;177;Reese Witherspoon was extraordinary, and her singing has made me want to sing.
I:12654;178;I don't care what anyone says, Witherspoon and Pheonix portray Johnny and June immaculately.
I:12654;179;Amazing movie, fantastic acting and beautiful singing!
I:12654;180;But this movie has definitely opened a door and I will be checking more into John Cash.
I:12654;181;I hope Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon definitely get recognition for the amazing work in this film.
I:12654;182;Joaquin gave a very complex performance and he had strong presence.
I:12654;183;"aside from the acting
I:12654;184;How many actors recorded an album as well as acted in the movie.
I:12654;185;You have a two time nominated Actor for Gladiator and now Walk the line.
I:12654;186;an 11 time Grammy winner who was given accolades from President Bush and loved by millions of fans in his 40 year career.
I:12654;187;"I will preface this by saying I was never a big Johnny Cash fan, but after seeing the excellent way Hollywood handled Ray Charles (""Ray"") and Bobby Darin (""Beyond the Sea"") I was anxious to see what it would do for The Man in Black."
I:12654;188;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are phenomenal as Johnny and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;189;This unlikely casting yields such outstanding results that I would hand them both the Oscar right now if I could.
I:12654;190;the film focuses on their love affair, first as friends and then torrid even while he was married to his first wife and the mother of his children.
I:12654;191;His drug abuse is highlighted but it is Johnny Cash, the complex man and his love for June Carter, darling daughter of the close.
I:12654;192;knit and totally supportive Carter clan, that comes shining through and makes this a totally enjoyable movie.
I:12654;193;two big thumbs up for a movie that thrills from its opening at the infamous Folsom Prison to its spectatcular closing.
I:12654;194;Joaquin Phoenix's towering performance and Reese Witherspoon Oscar.
I:12654;195;awarded breakthrough carry this 2005 movie, which ranks among the better biopics of the decade.
I:12654;196;Much of the credit for this goes to the T. bone Burnett's music, which helps the screenplay overcome some bumpy passages.
I:12654;197;Both leads act and sing their hearts out, which is a good thing, as it makes for some top.
I:12654;198;I dont know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent.
I:12654;199;I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though.
I:12654;200;I bought this as a gift for my father who lives in Los Angeles.
I:12654;201;I never knew that he was a huge Johnny Cash fan.
I:12654;202;I was so thrilled with this movie.
I:12654;203;This is a very good movie worth rewatching.
I:12654;204;Its probably one of the best movies I've seen from 2005.
I:12654;205;The acting is nearly flawless, and the story is engaging.
I:12654;206;Some of the scenes are quite intense and very realistic.
I:12654;207;that is a very good movie but you don't have it on netflix.
I:12654;208;Reese Witherspoon and Joaquim Phoenix did a splendid job of reconstructing the music and lives of stars June Carter and Johnny Cash.
I:12654;209;This movie brought home the fact that they along with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Orbison and others were the first big 'rock stars' and all toured the country together.
I:12654;210;i would like to see more on the life of this famous couple and hope the stars along with the dirctor can be persuaded to continue the story!
I:12654;211;For comparison's sake, let's realize that any actor taking on the role of a real and phenomenal man or woman is facing a daunting challenge.
I:12654;212;a pretty good imitation of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;213;Judging by this movie, Cash pretty much was a master singer and musician from the first moment he attempted both.
I:12654;214;The will to achieve his transformation also came from others.
I:12654;215;He was just along for the ride, without any determination of his own.
I:12654;216;The problem is that by the end of the movie, Cash has been portrayed as a man of unsubstantial courage, unsubstantial will, unsubstantial intellect, and unsubstantial compassion.
I:12654;217;My husband and friends walked out of the cinema and went back 5 days later to see this amazing movie again.
I:12654;218;Watching both sensational stars singing and acting their way through the life of John and June Carter Cash they became them.
I:12654;219;It was an enjoyable and uplifting film.
I:12654;220;The way this film starts out and how it chronicles the life of one of my favorite performers is really good and turns out to be better than I had thought it would be at first.
I:12654;221;the acting here is terrific and I have been impressed, Reese Witherspoon won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress along with many other recognitions, and Vivian and June's roles are both played extremely well and contributed to making this film as enjoyable as it I found it to be.
I:12654;222;This story I found to be an entertaining account, if not fully accurate, of Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;223;reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were both outstanding and deservedly Oscar winners (or nominees as in Phoenix's case).
I:12654;224;overall the movie about Johnny Cash's life is worth seeing at least once.
I:12654;225;It's about the life of Johnny Cash, and the love of his life June Carter Cash.
I:12654;226;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are fantastic playing the leading roles.
I:12654;227;i hope this the last one .
I:12654;228;"The short reply to describing ""Walk the Line"" is that it is a solid, real."
I:12654;229;life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart.
I:12654;230;The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.
I:12654;231;When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June.
I:12654;232;When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.
I:12654;233;reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet.
I:12654;234;She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable.
I:12654;235;Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after.
I:12654;236;to compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best.
I:12654;237;"While ""Ray"" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves."
I:12654;238;He is only a great singer and a good man at the end.
I:12654;239;see it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.
I:12654;240;"i fully recommend ""Walk the Line."
I:12654;241;when you're dealing with such a legend, it behooves you to make the right choice.
I:12654;242;go back and watch some vintage CASH footage, you'll see what i mean.
I:12654;243;this movie is wayyyyyyyyy overrated!
I:12654;244;"As many others have stated here, ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful film."
I:12654;245;The music is fantastic, and the fact that Phoenix and Witherspoon sing the songs themselves is quite impressive.
I:12654;246;don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and the music.
I:12654;247;"When I was little my father would play Johnny Cash records and I distinctly remember ""I Walk The Line""."
I:12654;248;walk the Line is a great movie.
I:12654;249;Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash, the man.
I:12654;250;Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good.
I:12654;251;There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.
I:12654;252;the music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing.
I:12654;253;But the love story between these two, the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart.
I:12654;254;I would recommend this film to anyone, Johnny Cash fan or not.
I:12654;255;Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for this performance in this film!!
I:12654;256;He is incredible and I feel he was robbed.
I:12654;257;Reese Witherspoon, is a charming, perky, sassy and pretty June and while I certainly agree that her performance is Oscar noteworthy, I feel it should have gone to Joaquin instead if they were going to choose one over the other.
I:12654;258;Nonetheless, the performances especially during the music scenes which are fantastic, give us a great take on The Man in Black and His Woman!!
I:12654;259;Joaquin Phoenix is superb as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon is superb as well as June Carter.
I:12654;260;Great acting, story and music.
I:12654;261;The actors were amazing and the music was awesome!
I:12654;262;The story line is awesome and it keeps you glued to the movie.
I:12654;263;My husband and I both enjoyed the movie and will share it with family members.
I:12654;264;From start to finish Walk the Line is a wonderful film.
I:12654;265;Joaquin Phoenix does a great job portraying the Man in Black, from the swagger in his walk to the singing to the stone cold look in his eyes.
I:12654;266;What an amazing casting decision!
I:12654;267;Reese Witherspoon does an equally good job portraying June Carter Cash.
I:12654;268;if you are a fan of Johnny Cash, this film is a must see.
I:12654;269;I refer you to the IMD website if you want a movie review.
I:12654;270;It was worth adding to my collection.
I:12654;271;The movie has great acting from J. Phoenix, who plays Johnny Cash, and Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter.
I:12654;272;It was amazing to see how much June helped him chase off the demons, literally, of these habits and move on to make great country western music.
I:12654;273;The film has a great feel to it as it brings across the era in spectacular color and vision.
I:12654;274;Some great scenes from his famous Folsom Prison Blues concert that took place inside Folsom prison.
I:12654;275;The film is more than just about the specific time in Cashs life, it's about how some people can be a positive influence if you let them in, and give them a chance.
I:12654;276;This is one of the best biopics that I have ever watched.
I:12654;277;"This, like Jamie Fox's portrayal of Ray Charles in 2004's ""Ray"" is an outstanding film."
I:12654;278;Phoenix and Witherspoon are brilliant and convincing in their roles as Johnny Cash, colorful folk writer and his wife, June Carter Cash.
I:12654;279;Johnny demonstrates a flair for music at an early age and his brother a talent for quoting Scripture.
I:12654;280;"i loved the way the history of the songs was included, such as ""Folsom Prison."""
I:12654;281;Her family rallied around Johnny Cash and helped him kick the dope habit.
I:12654;282;I just loved it when her dad chased a dealer off, sending the man scurrying away in his 1964 Ford Ranchero.
I:12654;283;the song selection is excellent and the cast did a stellar job of portraying Cash and Carter.
I:12654;284;All in all, a solid performance.
I:12654;285;For the most part, Walk the Line is simply a standard.
I:12654;286;good biopic, but the performances .
I:12654;287;elevate it to another level.
I:12654;288;the film is a lot of fun for fans of classic rock and roll.
I:12654;289;"Playing ""spot the future icon"" is a lot of fun when, say, Elvis is recording his demo song (one that few music fans would immediately recognize) or offering young Johnny Cash some uppers, in a moment of dubious historical reality, but great foreshadowing for the King of Rock and Roll."
I:12654;290;it's credible enough and a lot of fun to listen to.
I:12654;291;"Her portrayal of ""the other woman"" agonizing over her place in Cash's marriage is believable and touching."
I:12654;292;a great deal of fun and strongly recommended for fans of Reese Witherspoon or classic country or rock and roll music.
I:12654;293;I absolutely and always have loved Johnny Cash.
I:12654;294;For comparison's sake, Gary Busey did a superior job of Buddy Holly.
I:12654;295;This movie is okay for those who didn't necessarily grow up on J. cash.
I:12654;296;"I liked him better in ""Inventing the Abbotts"" much better than this one (I actually liked that movie better than this one, but that's another debate.)"
I:12654;297;"In short, this is one of those, ""the audience loves the movie for who's in it."""
I:12654;298;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon channels the spirits of Johnny and June Cash.
I:12654;299;He is the rebel with a musdical cause.
I:12654;300;You can debate if he should have won the Oscar.
I:12654;301;I am sorry he didn't but it still is an amazing performance.
I:12654;302;files's Robert Patrick is great as Cash's Father ray.
I:12654;303;however this film is a great piece of bio filmmaking in the cinema of reality with such films like Ray, Capote, Miracles, and the Great EscapeWell worth getting, all the performances are so well doneBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD
I:12654;304;Let me start off by saying Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in the business.
I:12654;305;He made us hate him in Gladiator, love him in Ladder 49, and now hate him and love him in Walk the Line.
I:12654;306;this is a great movie, that in my opinion, should have taken a lot more academy awards than it did.
I:12654;307;Following the life of Johnny Cash from when he was a kid to when he's a succesful country/rock artist, this movie did a good job portraying Johnny Cash as he was.
I:12654;308;bottom Line: Joaquin and Reese do a phenomenal job singing Cash and Carter's songs, and also do a phenomenal job playing their parts.
I:12654;309;Walk the Line is above average, but that is principally due to the excellence of its actors.
I:12654;310;Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine.
I:12654;311;It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing.
I:12654;312;It is not great cinema but its craftsmanship and devotion to detail place it on a plane far above the rest which Hollywood usually offers.
I:12654;313;I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June.
I:12654;314;This adds a new perspective on the classic songs.
I:12654;315;Walk the Line has already been well.
I:12654;316;"reviewed
I:12654;317;Leads Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon each excell in their roles, with respect to both their acting and their singing.
I:12654;318;done overall, but some of the deleted scenes, while brief, so enhanced the film that I wonder at the rationale which caused them to be left out of the theatrical release.
I:12654;319;Specifically, several scenes expand on the relationships amongst the main characters, from showing Cash's first encounters with Jerry Lee Lewis and the Carter family to providing glimpses into tender moments between Cash and his first wife.
I:12654;320;Perhaps the producers were reluctant to add to the movie's already lengthy running time (135 minutes), but honestly, the story was so engaging that I never once looked at the clock.
I:12654;321;Phoenix will get best actor.
I:12654;322;beautifully filmed, emotional and smart.
I:12654;323;probably would have won that Best Picture Oscar, at least.
I:12654;324;The most striking thing about this movie, and something that has been widely mentioned with good reason, are the spectacular performances of the movie's lead characters, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;325;Their acting is tremendous, but as Johnny Cash and June Carter they do their own singing as well, and pull it off remarkably well.
I:12654;326;I believe Cash's voice to be inimitable, but Phoenix makes a very good attempt.
I:12654;327;most of the movie's entertainment value comes from the music.
I:12654;328;the singing throughout is certainly the highlight.
I:12654;329;The movie dragged a bit for me at times, but for the most part flowed fairly well, and some of the most interesting events in Cash's life (his introduction to Folsom while in the Air Force, touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, etc) are chronicled well.
I:12654;330;Despite this fact, however, this was a very entertaining movie and certainly worthwhile.
I:12654;331;Walk the Line (Widescreen Edition)~ Joaquin Phoenix is such a good movie that I am in earnest left speechless.
I:12654;332;Witherspoon is truly astounding in her role as June Carter and Phoenix is just grand in his portrayal of the man in black.
I:12654;333;This is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen period and it ranks up their with favorites such as The English Patient and Restoration.
I:12654;334;The singing (yes they do sing live) is almost to good to be true and Phoenix has been able not just to portray Johnny Cash.
I:12654;335;He has emulated everything about him and sometimes you forget that you are watching a movie and you start to think that you are seeing something real.
I:12654;336;The same is true with Witherspoons portrayal of June Carter and one can safely bet that she is an A list actor and will not be doing anymore movies like legally blond 2 anymore.
I:12654;337;if you like movies about an artist who struggled with drugs and came through it you will like this movie.
I:12654;338;if you like movies about chasing after the girl of your dreams till you get her you will like this movie.
I:12654;339;I truly loved this movie.
I:12654;340;"The story was great even if it was ""beefed"" up in places."
I:12654;341;Of course I have been an avid admirer of Joaquin's acting since I first saw him.
I:12654;342;Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash .
I:12654;343;shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him.
I:12654;344;He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock.
I:12654;345;Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best.
I:12654;346;selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).
I:12654;347;"Johnny Cash's voice (""Like a freight train coming `round a bend but sharp as a razor"") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role."
I:12654;348;It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip.
I:12654;349;the shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.
I:12654;350;Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip.
I:12654;351;Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).
I:12654;352;still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry.
I:12654;353;I'm sure my dad loved it, too.
I:12654;354;the movie is very good.
I:12654;355;both joaquin and reese did a great job.
I:12654;356;the 2nd disc is very good as well.
I:12654;357;i recommend having a nice steak dinner and then relaxing in front of the television to watch this movie.
I:12654;358;This movie was very good and the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon were wonderful.
I:12654;359;He went more than once to Betty Ford and fought his addiction most of his life.
I:12654;360;however, the movie was wonderful and I would definitely add it to my collection.
I:12654;361;Joaquin Phoenix did a fabulous job.
I:12654;362;He is totally believable as Johnny Cash.
I:12654;363;"Reese Witherspoon is also wonderful as June Carter, but if I had to pick one ""best performance"" it would be Phoenix."
I:12654;364;Joaquin was perfect as Johnny Cash and Reese clocks in with yet another great performance.
I:12654;365;i was, however, raised on Johnny Cash, and my family has roots in cotton, the South, and some of those uneasy places where souls, love, God, and living on this earth either intersect or collide.
I:12654;366;Whether Phoenix and Witherspoon portrayed their characters with perfect biographical accuracy is unimportant to me.
I:12654;367;This film described and validated, as best as I might expect, my feeling of the essence of Johnny Cash, June Carter, and their life and times.
I:12654;368;Their spirits swirl through it.
I:12654;369;Phoenix's performance has been hailed as genius, but I wasn't impressed.
I:12654;370;This is, of course, a crowd.
I:12654;371;pleaser and I know many people LOVE it.
I:12654;372;I love johnny cash, read his books and this is a good portrait of his life.
I:12654;373;I'm a huge movie fan, and am quite critical.
I:12654;374;Reese and Joaquin are extremely impressive in this film, and I'm so glad Reese won Best Actress.
I:12654;375;This should have won Best Picture by far.
I:12654;376;Nobody can exactly capture Johnny's unique gruff voice, but Joaquin did such a great job.
I:12654;377;The movie flowed nicely from beginning to end, and I loved the subtle hints in Johnny's life that inspired his music.
I:12654;378;I will own it and watch it again and again!
I:12654;379;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:12654;380;joaqiuin phoenix should have won the oscar.
I:12654;381;phoenix is better, though (and does his own singing), and director James Mangold, in a commentary, praises the actor unabashedly.
I:12654;382;One of the most memorable scenes has Cash watching from the wings as Elvis Presley (played by Tyler Hilton) wows a crowd of screaming teenagers.
I:12654;383;There's the early life and its troubles often depicted as providing the impetus for the subject's later success.
I:12654;384;There's the scene in which the hero discovers his talent or calling and struggles to effectively develop or present it to whomever (in this case, Sun Records' producer Sam Phillips) holds the power to bring it to the world.
I:12654;385;Walk the Line doesn't stray from the formula yet makes the cliches of the genre seem fresh because they allow Johnny Cash to appear not merely as a legend, an almost Mount Rushmore figure in popular music, but as a man full of doubts about his talent and his soul, and Phoenix captures him superbly.
I:12654;386;It's a fine, superbly realized film, a testament to both the legend of its subject, and to the talents of its stars.
I:12654;387;If you are looking for a story of the man that was Johnny Cash and the woman he loved almost his entire iife this is the movie that tells it.
I:12654;388;It is just wonderful to get an insight on one of the best love storys in music's history.
I:12654;389;This movie holds a special place in my heart, mainly because I and my family are big Johnny and June Cash fans, but for other reasons as well.
I:12654;390;That being said, this movie is a fantastic love story, filled with twists and turns, that keeps you seated until the credits.
I:12654;391;Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon), Walk The Line chronicles the life and times of legendary country music star Johnny Cash with an intense, and sometimes dark, intimacy.
I:12654;392;Following on the heels of the previous year's Oscar Award.
I:12654;393;But although the dramatic personal struggle with drug addiction is prevalent in both films, Walk The Line was more than able to stand on its own as a powerful and impressionable big screen biography.
I:12654;394;And just like the aforementioned film, you leave Walk The Line with a renewed interest in the music of Johnny Cash and a deep personal attachment to the lives of Cash and his likeable wife, June Carter.
I:12654;395;directed by James Mangold, the talent behind such notable films as Kate and Leopold (2001) and Identity (2003), Walk The Line begins in the rough and tumble world of Depression.
I:12654;396;But during his tour with the quartet, the life of Johnny Cash takes numerous turns.
I:12654;397;When Cash reunites with June Carter in a musical collaboration, the magical bond between the two is amplified.
I:12654;398;the most impressive aspect of Walk The Line, aside from the storyline itself, is the performance of Witherspoon and her counterpart Phoenix.
I:12654;399;Much was made of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the days leading up to the film's release, but I came away more impressed by Witherspoon.
I:12654;400;earth smile and charismatic mannerisms.
I:12654;401;She created a character with ample assertiveness, yet one that burst at the seams with an infectious optimism and love for life.
I:12654;402;In addition, Witherspoon displays an amazing singing voice that accurately captures the distinct and unique aspects of June Carter's talent.
I:12654;403;Overall, Walk The Line is a fine film, and a fitting remembrance to the career and life of country music's greatest icon, Johnny Cash.
I:12654;404;Joaquine once again proved to be one of the most exceptional actors ever to hit the screen along with the talented Reese who proved to her audience that she is not only a comical romance actress but a true dramatic actress.
I:12654;405;Both poored their hearts into thier acting and into their singing.
I:12654;406;she belt out such an amazing sound, off the charts!
I:12654;407;She is an amazing entertainer.
I:12654;408;It was so intense that I was completely revved up for the show.
I:12654;409;the entire movie was amazing although I couldn't beleive the actors they chose for Elvis and Jerry Lee.
I:12654;410;She was dramatic in every aspect and played the part just as real to life as it comes.
I:12654;411;i absolutely suggest to anyone who enjoys even a good love story to see this movie.
I:12654;412;It is full of so many aspects of life.
I:12654;413;This was a great Movie.
I:12654;414;I have been a Johnny Cash fan for years.
I:12654;415;This movie was a breath of fresh air.
I:12654;416;It was a great movie over all you all need to see this great movie.
I:12654;417;Scenes and photos from the movie!
I:12654;418;The actors portraying the real people.
I:12654;419;All the 'featurettes' are pretty much like that.
I:12654;420;As far as the movie: great.
I:12654;421;Easily one of my favorite movies.
I:12654;422;The commentary by the director was good and it was nice to know that a majority of this movie is actually true.
I:12654;423;gOOD DEAL!The movie is fun, interesting, and emotional.
I:12654;424;"the movie shows the life and times of Johnny Cash, from boyhood when a traumatic event begins his sad attitude towards life
I:12654;425;free lifestyle in the spotlight, married to June Carter.
I:12654;426;reese Witherspoon won a Best Actress Academy Award Oscar for her role as June Carter Cash.
I:12654;427;It is all very insightful, as to the movie making process for this film.
I:12654;428;Yes, you saw that he was an enlisted man, and yes you met his first wife and children.
I:12654;429;Totally enjoyed the performances of Joaquin and Reese, making the movie even that much more enjoyable.
I:12654;430;"The story line was good
I:12654;431;Saw the movie 4 times and picked up more and more detail each and every time while being totally engrossed with the music and the 'times'.
I:12654;432;Will give some of my friends who loved the movie as much as I did a copy to enjoy.
I:12654;433;If you love one or both you will probably enjoy the film.
I:12654;434;If you want to see a great movie.
I:12654;435;The reason I viewed it was because I like a well done biography regardless of the genre or subject matter.
I:12654;436;He got invovled with drugs, recovered, and then married the girl of his dreams.
I:12654;437;Both he and Loretta made a huge impact on country music.
I:12654;438;In the end it is simply a love story that we have all seen before.
I:12654;439;I had seen the movie a while back and ordered this because it was a good price.
I:12654;440;:) It is a very good movie.
I:12654;441;WALK THE LINE is the best of this year's Oscar contenders.
I:12654;442;The movie is an excellently done adaptation of a period in the life of one modern music's greatest artists .
I:12654;443;Instead of merely acting out the role as Cash, Phoenix delivers an interpretation of a very gifted man who is tortured by guilt and regret, resentment and depression.
I:12654;444;His Cash yearns for redemption and peace.
I:12654;445;most notable is Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter, Johnny's friend and future wife.
I:12654;446;in the truest sense of the phrase.
I:12654;447;the love of his life.
I:12654;448;this was quite an ambitious role for an actress best known for her light comedy.
I:12654;449;But Witherspoon surprises us all by delivering an astounding performance.
I:12654;450;with this movie both Phoenix and Witherspoon advance far up the ranks as serious actors.
I:12654;451;walk The Line is an amazing movie about a part of Johnny Cash's life, namely his love affair with June Carter that manages to fit in other parts of his very talented filled.
I:12654;452;downs life as well perfectly, without overdoing or underdoing it.
I:12654;453;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are perfect fits for Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;454;Their chemistry together in the movie is flawless.
I:12654;455;the singing is terrific too, Phoenix does an mind.
I:12654;456;IMO he should have won an Academy Award for his performance.
I:12654;457;I give it an A+ across the board.
I:12654;458;As a consequence Cash is seen as a person who always feels aggrieved and is infinitely needy.
I:12654;459;Withersppon's June Carter is also neurotic but she manages to bring the warmth and caring that Cash craves.
I:12654;460;one thing I learned from watching this is that adultery is cool.
I:12654;461;See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.
I:12654;462;"The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit ""needed to be free"" so he could make his wonderful music."
I:12654;463;Seemed, very true to Johnny Cash's life, from what I have read about him.
I:12654;464;I, thought Jaoquin Phionix did a great job portraying him.
I:12654;465;I came out of the movie theater having a new found respect for June and Johnny.
I:12654;466;This is one to see.
I:12654;467;dimensional, and the story kept jumping from one incident to another.
I:12654;468;The actors are brilliant in their roles and the singing is fabulous.
I:12654;469;This movie showcases Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix at their finest.
I:12654;470;The movie is thoroughly entertaining.
I:12654;471;I *heart* both Joaquin and Reese as actors, and this movie did not disappoint.
I:12654;472;And I was seriously impressed by their stepping up to do all their own singing/playing .
I:12654;473;the interpretation was, to me, more believable than using actual Johnny/June tracks and lip syncing.
I:12654;474;Walk the Line covers the early life of J. r. Cash beginning with his childhood in 1944.
I:12654;475;After his hitch was up, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian and moved to Memphis.
I:12654;476;the meat of the story is how the young Johnny Cash found his own particular sound, how he nearly self.
I:12654;477;destructed and was saved, and how he and June finally came together.
I:12654;478;Oddly enough, and fortunately for the director, all three threads of his story merged in 1968, so it was a good place to end the movie.
I:12654;479;it's an honest movie, with award.
I:12654;480;winning performances by both Phoenix and Witherspoon.
I:12654;481;Phoenix is great as Cash.
I:12654;482;He has the look and the voice.
I:12654;483;The plot is good and interesting, but it gets a little boring at some moments.
I:12654;484;The movie has great music and a good feel.
I:12654;485;I'm glad I did because it was a great movie and story.
I:12654;486;Phoniex and Witherspoon did an excellent job imo.
I:12654;487;There was another review here that I agreed with completely.
I:12654;488;So, you take an element of their life.
I:12654;489;the makers of WALK THE LINE chose to tell the story of their romance and how it came about for them to finally marry each other.
I:12654;490;joaquin Phoenix captured JOHNNY CASH amazingly.
I:12654;491;He was truly amazing and should have won previously for GLADIATOR anyway.
I:12654;492;the film brings to light the uncontrollable hold that love has on a soul and captured some truly wondeful moments of devotion, friendship, loneliness and that sometimes, everyone needs a helping hand to get out of an abyss.
I:12654;493;not to mention, captured some truly great musical performances.
I:12654;494;it's a wonderful movie with OSCAR calibur performances, but the rock star life has been told before.
I:12654;495;Walk the Line tells the story of country music star Johnny Cash from his early days until his marriage to June Carter in 1968.
I:12654;496;Joaquin Phoenix is terrific, capturing the mannerisms and singing style of Cash as well as any actor possibly could.
I:12654;497;Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as well.
I:12654;498;Her June Carter is a spunky, intelligent young woman who finally manages to provide Cash the solid grounding that he so desperately needs.
I:12654;499;i especially enjoyed the scenes of Johnny's childhood.
I:12654;500;The movie really captures the simplicity and hardship of life in rural Arkansas at this time.
I:12654;501;the film's most prominent musical focus is on Cash's early days as a rockabilly artist, hanging out with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the boys.
I:12654;502;"So they remained ""only friends"" for many years before admitting their passion and love for one another."
I:12654;503;But by this time Cash had become addicted to pharmaceutical drugs and June realized a successful marriage would be impossible.
I:12654;504;"overall ""Walk the Line"" is a terrific film about two extraordinary people."
I:12654;505;The music is great and if you are a Johnny Cash fan you will love listening to it.
I:12654;506;Everything in this movie has been so well thought out and the singing is AMAZING!
I:12654;507;This is a very inspirational movie and no doubt, one of my all time favorites!
I:12654;508;This film joins other biopics such as Coalminer's Daughter and Ray in it's endearing and truthful account of the life of country music icon Johnny Cash.
I:12654;509;The film is engaging and manages to sweep even those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Cash into the roller coaster of events that comprised his often troubling, but ultimately fulfilling life.
I:12654;510;This film is most definitely a must.
I:12654;511;see for all audiences and for those who remember and cherish the legacy Johnny Cash left behind after his death, a must.
I:12654;512;Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything.
I:12654;513;Johnny(called J. r) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw.
I:12654;514;He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2.
I:12654;515;the film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June.
I:12654;516;While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them.
I:12654;517;"Listening to ""I Walk the Line"" in the film was like wow, he's quite good."
I:12654;518;in a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real.
I:12654;519;Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him.
I:12654;520;there's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life.
I:12654;521;But overall the price was wonderful and shipping was fast.
I:12654;522;The film opens as most biopics do, with a glimpse into the subject's childhood with emphasis on one event.
I:12654;523;The relationship between June Carter and Johnny Cash was certainly complicated yet it was beautifully unique.
I:12654;524;It is the story of these two individuals that gives the movie the heart and honesty that it holds throughout.
I:12654;525;Phoenix is quite good at reminding us that he was human, and his darker side often had control.
I:12654;526;But his affection for Carter was strong enough to save him and inspiration enough to keep him going.
I:12654;527;Mangold understands and appreciates his subject and he's done his research.
I:12654;528;Phoenix and Witherspoon have put so much time and effort into taking voice lessons to make the film as authentic as possible.
I:12654;529;The people involved in the making of this film are well aware of the musical giant Cash was and love that Carter and Cash shared.
I:12654;530;as for the parallels this draws to Ray and the tales of other musicians, that is part coincidence and partly intended.
I:12654;531;These are mostly small details, though, and the film remains credible and unhindered.
I:12654;532;johnny Cash was a pioneer of Rock n' Roll music and his influence and appeal spans all genres and generations.
I:12654;533;I finally got a copy of Walk the Line.
I:12654;534;It was as good as I had heard.
I:12654;535;Both Joaquin and Reese did a super job.
I:12654;536;I'm so happy for her winning the award.
I:12654;537;Both leads are so talented for being able to learn the music they had to learn for their roles.
I:12654;538;Well worth it for the extras you get.
I:12654;539;This movie is a roller coaster of emotion and a journey through the life a man who had seen it all.
I:12654;540;There are movies that want to tell a story and there are movies that want to transcend simple storytelling to become an emotional, and sometimes spiritual experience.
I:12654;541;Walk the Line is the former, but it's amazing at what it does.
I:12654;542;It realistically and efficiently portrays the early life of The Man In Black, focusing on his relationship with June Carter before their marriage in 1968.
I:12654;543;It's a pretty standard story in rock star biopic terms (drug abuse, multiple marriages, infidelities), but Walk the Line rises above many of it's overcooked brethren in its simplicity, beautiful direction, and outstanding performances.
I:12654;544;As opposed to films like Oliver Stone's The Doors, which is both hazy and mystical, James Mangold's effort, with the help of DP Phedon Papamichael, wipes away the celebrity veneer with concise and intimate visuals.
I:12654;545;Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is astounding.
I:12654;546;His voice, his mannerisms, his looks, are pure Cash.
I:12654;547;Reese Witherspoon more than keeps up with her powerful co. star.
I:12654;548;She is a sympathetic beauty, much like June Carter, and she has the voice to boot.
I:12654;549;To undersell it, the chemistry between the two stars is totally engrossing.
I:12654;550;And of course, because it's a film about Johnny Cash, the music is lovely.
I:12654;551;In short, Walk the Line is an interesting story brought to life through a very talented cast and crew.
I:12654;552;Who doesnt love this movie??
I:12654;553;I think it is one of the greatest love stories ever!
I:12654;554;Juaquin and Reese light up the screen together.
I:12654;555;One of my favorite movies ever.
I:12654;556;A classic in the making!
I:12654;557;James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interestingfilms as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again.
I:12654;558;Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for herportrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Familysingers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merelyanother way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy youngstarlets.
I:12654;559;Financially, for the long term of theindustry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films theyappear in can bear the Oscar imprint.
I:12654;560;What Mangold does not graspis that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of hissinging and songwriting.
I:12654;561;In other words, as the saying goes, always printthe legend over the truth.
I:12654;562;joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon did a phenomenal job as the two lovebirds and I thought that they both did a great job singing in the movie as well considering neither of them had sung professionally before.
I:12654;563;The rest of the supporting characters were also very good and made this movie very nice to watch
I:12654;564;"made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions
I:12654;565;"movies featured outstanding music and slick photography
I:12654;566;"moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long
I:12654;567;and he was very good.
I:12654;568;Her singing talent surprised me.
I:12654;569;It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.
I:12654;570;Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father.
I:12654;571;i'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades.
I:12654;572;true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business.
I:12654;573;with all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life.
I:12654;574;He was an amazing man and a four.
I:12654;575;joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.
I:12654;576;Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.
I:12654;577;ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.
I:12654;578;Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.
I:12654;579;He is terrific as Johnny Cash.
I:12654;580;JR loved his brother and lives forever with the haunting fact that his father will never love him.
I:12654;581;The Carter family prove that love and understanding of others, even when most people give up on them, can conquer all.
I:12654;582;Wisdom, compassion and goodness flows from the Mother and Dad Carter, and you can't help but wish to have known them personally in your own life.
I:12654;583;Joaquin does a marvelous job in this movie.
I:12654;584;It is a truly moving and terrific movie.
I:12654;585;Especially if you are a fan of Country/Western, but even if you are not, you will find it to be funny, serious, emotional and touching.
I:12654;586;A must see and a real keeper.
I:12654;587;This movie is a wonderful story because it is strong on every component:1.)
I:12654;588;Historic/Biographical Content: It gives you little dates and locations at various scenes so you can follow along and know what happens in which year.
I:12654;589;Their voices and talents are phenomenal!
I:12654;590;They hit EVERY note, EVERY time.
I:12654;591;The Romance: You can tell, early in their friendship, that June and Johnny are attracted to one another.
I:12654;592;I was sooo moved when they finally had sex.
I:12654;593;Appropriateness: While this film has some drug usage and language, I still found it appropriate for the entire family.
I:12654;594;There is no violence (with the exception of Johnny's outburst early in the film, backstage).
I:12654;595;Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line.
I:12654;596;As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life.
I:12654;597;Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).
I:12654;598;let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods.
I:12654;599;There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story).
I:12654;600;Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film.
I:12654;601;the concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close.
I:12654;602;It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience.
I:12654;603;Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless.
I:12654;604;Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally.
I:12654;605;The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically.
I:12654;606;It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies.
I:12654;607;Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating.
I:12654;608;what the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them.
I:12654;609;Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human.
I:12654;610;He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June.
I:12654;611;There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny.
I:12654;612;OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.
I:12654;613;Capitalizing on the popularity of Ray , Walk the Line also chronicles the turbulent career and life of an iconic musician, applying the same plot structure .
I:12654;614;Like Ray Charles, Johnny Cash struggled with substance abuse but helped beat addiction with the help from the love of a good woman.
I:12654;615;walk the Line is a fine, return to form for director James Mangold who started his career with the independent darling, Heavy and then followed it up with the star.
I:12654;616;Walk the Line is definitely a return to meatier, more substantial material.
I:12654;617;joaquin Phoenix is a strong actor who has been in search of the right role and has finally found it with this movie.
I:12654;618;Walk the Line is perfectly matched with his considerable talents.
I:12654;619;reese Witherspoon utilizes her adorable, plucky persona that she's cultivated for years to maximum effect as Carter, matching Phoenix's intensity and willingness to immerse herself completely in the role.
I:12654;620;Carter is the strong, moral centre on a tour filled with legendary bad boys .
I:12654;621;She resists the lures of the open road and constant touring .
I:12654;622;that Cash succumbs to and this is part of her attraction to him.
I:12654;623;It is her purity and loyalty .
I:12654;624;Carter is just as stubborn as he is and sticks by him because she loves and believes in him.
I:12654;625;Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry together as they play out their on again/off again romance.
I:12654;626;They compliment each other so well.
I:12654;627;Cash is wild and Carter is wholesome and it is these ying and yang qualities that they love about each other.
I:12654;628;Mangold speaks eloquently about his filmmaking process, the film's themes and Cash's life, delivering a very informative track.
I:12654;629;This movie was great in that it told the story well with great actors and great emotion and attention to detail.
I:12654;630;Don't get me wrong, his songs, talent, and his passion are still significant.
I:12654;631;Reese you did June Carter Cash proud.
I:12654;632;As far as Phoniex's performance as Johnny Cash he was amazing he was able to show the serious side of a performer that not many of his fans saw.
I:12654;633;I would recommend this movie to anyone who loved or appreciated Johnny Cash's music.
I:12654;634;who would have believed that ANYONE could have played and sang these roles so well.
I:12654;635;a movie to watch again and again.
I:12654;636;Johnny Cash was a legend and deserves his own tribute in film.
I:12654;637;This is a definite must see film for any country music fan.
I:12654;638;The actors in this movie did an excellent job of portraying Johnny and June Cash.
I:12654;639;"The movie gives insight into the lives offstage that created the""man in black""."
I:12654;640;think the performances are just terrific.
I:12654;641;The sound and video are really top.
I:12654;642;notch and the music really enjoyable.
I:12654;643;I also enjoyed the deleted scens on the first disc and really to think this is a movie worth adding to the personal collection.
I:12654;644;a special on the Folsom Prison concert.
I:12654;645;clearly one of the most important steps in Cash's career.
I:12654;646;I found the same to be true of the other specials on the disc as well.
I:12654;647;"Lots of shots of the two stars but very little of the ""Man in Black"" himself."
I:12654;648;First of all, let me say that Walk the Line is the good movie, with great acting.
I:12654;649;Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar, and I believe Joaquin Phoenix, should have won an Oscar.
I:12654;650;now, I believe that this movie should've won best picture.
I:12654;651;There are also several songs by Reese and Joaquin.
I:12654;652;I walked into this movie and within a few minutes I wsa drawn in and completly engrossed in what proved to be one of the best films I have seen this year.
I:12654;653;appreciated Domino) I was so happy to walk out of a film feeling glad that I went.
I:12654;654;but after watching this movie I have a newfound respect for the man.
I:12654;655;By the end you will be in tears and you will come to appreciate the man that is now the legend.
I:12654;656;But these are minor quibbles about a good film about a great man and musician.
I:12654;657;This is a great movie primarily due to the acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon and of course the music.
I:12654;658;While Cash's personal life obviously languishes, Carter's also quietly self destructs over the years.
I:12654;659;All the music is amazing, particularly as sung by the two leads.
I:12654;660;Witherspoon is surprising, particularly her singing and she plays a girlish yet strong Carter whose family is there for Cash as well, supplementing the early family support he never had.
I:12654;661;A great film and my only critique would be to have had even more song performances.
I:12654;662;Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.
I:12654;663;as good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.
I:12654;664;joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.
I:12654;665;One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.
I:12654;666;I think this inspirational message could have been communicated a little more effectively in the movie, but it certainly makes the story worth telling.
I:12654;667;Johnny Cash fan or not, Walk the Line is a movie worth watching.
I:12654;668;i think Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Cash was very good.
I:12654;669;overall this is a decent movie, but it really mainly focused on the Cash/Carter relationship over a relatively short timespan.
I:12654;670;The performances by Pheonix and Witherspoon are really class acts.
I:12654;671;I thought their singing was great, especially considering that I knew what the songs were supposed to sound like.
I:12654;672;Wow such a great movie.
I:12654;673;And the sound is awesome.
I:12654;674;Awesome movie to begin with, but the added scenes make it even more awesome.
I:12654;675;Really helps move the movie along and shows the music sequences in their entirety.
I:12654;676;reese Witherspoon definitely deserved the award she won for Best Actress this year, and even though Joaquin Phoenix didn't win the award for Best Actor, he certainly did a great job himself.
I:12654;677;probably the most stunning part of the movie was that Witherspoon and Phoenix both learned to sing and play instruments.
I:12654;678;Neither of them had had any previous knowledge of music or singing, yet the result was stunning.
I:12654;679;While Phoenix does not sound exactly like Johnny Cash, and Witherspoon does not sound exactly like June Carter, they definitely evoke the feelings and do the songs justice.
I:12654;680;one of the great parts about this movie was that neither of them were imitating their characters, they were simply emulating them.
I:12654;681;The fact that that element is present in this movie makes it a cut above your normal fare.
I:12654;682;There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film.
I:12654;683;But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time.
I:12654;684;After Carter thanks her for the sentiment.
I:12654;685;"home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application ""With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness."
I:12654;686;But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes.
I:12654;687;It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed.
I:12654;688;there are some people that are so complex, so multi.
I:12654;689;Johnny Cash is that kind of person.
I:12654;690;He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity.
I:12654;691;WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds.
I:12654;692;Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash.
I:12654;693;It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded.
I:12654;694;She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.
I:12654;695;So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?
I:12654;696;Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.
I:12654;697;T Bone Burnett has done it again.
I:12654;698;He captured the sound of the times.
I:12654;699;He nails down Cash's music quite nicely.
I:12654;700;Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task.
I:12654;701;i also liked director Mangold's attention to detail.
I:12654;702;This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way.
I:12654;703;WALK THE LINE is a fine bio.
I:12654;704;pic, it has some brilliant acting.
I:12654;705;It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much.
I:12654;706;It was the moment that felt honest?
I:12654;707;if you are a fan of Johnny Cash or movies that are based on the life of stars, you will enjoy this movie.
I:12654;708;I didn't grow up with Johnny Cash, so I don't know his exact life story, but I do know that I love his music and enjoy this movie enough to give it five stars and watch it over and over again since it came out.
I:12654;709;Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.
I:12654;710;You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.
I:12654;711;"I have no doubt in my mind that time will be kind to ""Walk the Line"" and be re."
I:12654;712;evaluated as the truly great film that it is.
I:12654;713;Unbelievable performance by Joaquin so give the award to Reese right?!
I:12654;714;She was good but what about the Phoenix!
I:12654;715;Its a movie you can watch again and again.
I:12654;716;This movie covers the life of Johnny Cash from childhood to about the year 1968.
I:12654;717;a relationship beteen Johnny and June grows slowly but his addiction to pills brings it off track.
I:12654;718;Joaquin Phoenix is superb as Johnny.
I:12654;719;It is a truly fine acting job.
I:12654;720;Also, his musical performaces are very good.
I:12654;721;Again, Johnny had a very distinctive voice and no one can sound just like him.
I:12654;722;reese Witherspoon is one of my favorite actresses and her wonderful, lively, enthusiatic portrayal of June did not disappoint my expectations.
I:12654;723;In 1983, I saw Johnny and June in concert at Lake Tahoe and the onstage mannerisms of the two were captured well in the movie.
I:12654;724;(By the way, I loved seeing them live, they were great).
I:12654;725;Still, the movie was riviting and well acted so I round this solid 4 and a half star effort up to five stars.
I:12654;726;That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.
I:12654;727;Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.
I:12654;728;It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.
I:12654;729;anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.
I:12654;730;She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.
I:12654;731;The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.
I:12654;732;Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.
I:12654;733;She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.
I:12654;734;in short, I liked the film.
I:12654;735;I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.
I:12654;736;This film is worth the time invested.
I:12654;737;This film is a deserved tribute surely.
I:12654;738;"The casting is marvelous
I:12654;739;Phoenix and Witherspoon are a delightful couple.
I:12654;740;She sparkles like a star, even when he, like a stone, drops into one of his moods.
I:12654;741;Again and again, we see pictures of the 50s and 60s in film and wonder what happened to this great country.
I:12654;742;My daughter is a big Reese Witherspoon fan and my wife grew up near Nashville.
I:12654;743;so the movie seemed like a good fit.
I:12654;744;The most surprising thing to me was all the fuss about Witherspoon's performance.
I:12654;745;she was a consensus favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar and did so.
I:12654;746;Her singing was a nice surprise, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was much stronger in his role as Johnny Cash.
I:12654;747;I was so impressed with this movie when I saw the acing and the voices were amazing especially Johnny Cash.
I:12654;748;"The colors are vibrant, but they can also look oversaturated at times and maybe a tad too bright for ultimate realism
I:12654;749;"Put it another way
I:12654;750;There is a very wide front.
I:12654;751;"channel stero spread
I:12654;752;The result is an enjoyable listening experience all the way around.
I:12654;753;On the main commentary, Mangold tells us the movie is about a man who got a second chance in life because he was blessed enough to be visited by an angel in the form of a really incredibly great woman.
I:12654;754;The commentary is fun to watch.
I:12654;755;special Features: 5 stars out of 10.
I:12654;756;That kind of loyal and stoic woman is a rarity nowadays.
I:12654;757;She deserves a monument or a tribute of sorts.
I:12654;758;Very good character actors made this a wonderful watch and rewatching experience.
I:12654;759;I remember seeing this movie and walking out of the theater thinking that that was the best female performance I had ever seen in any movie.
I:12654;760;I was also impressed by the fact that all the actors did their own singing.
I:12654;761;Fortunately, this is becoming more and more common in movies.
I:12654;762;I would love to have seen the happy years.
I:12654;763;Walk the Line is a wonderful story of both of them, put together and fully adapted by Director, James Mangold.
I:12654;764;honestly the acting by Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix was simply astounding, Neither Withspoon or Phoenix looked anything like the people that they were playing.
I:12654;765;Witherspoon also did an awsome job playing the up.
I:12654;766;the screenwriting was also pretty while written as well as just about every other type of production for this film.
I:12654;767;the reason comes down to age, as I said I am 16 and I really dont care about the Cash's so I cant say I loved it because well .
I:12654;768;BUT it must be a pretty good movie for me to like even though I dont much care for the topic!
I:12654;769;This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she really loves it.
I:12654;770;She had seen it at the movies and wanted her own.
I:12654;771;this is a fantastic movie and the actors are so good.
I:12654;772;"i have a new respect for ""J. r."" Cash."
I:12654;773;It had just enough of everything to make it a wonderful movie.
I:12654;774;take the time, it's a great family movie.
I:12654;775;watch The Next Bit,And Back I Would Go.
I:12654;776;And The Sceen Where He Play's In The Prison Was The Best.
I:12654;777;This is my go to love story movie.
I:12654;778;Thought Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were wonderfully cast.
I:12654;779;Their stories were well done and seemed to be accurate.
I:12654;780;I would recommend this film.
I:12654;781;My husband and I saw this movie and thought it was excellent.
I:12654;782;"I grew up with Johnny Cash and June Carters music and this movie helped me come to know them and what they went through to become ""one."""
I:12654;783;It is worth the price of a ticket and as part of any collection.
I:12654;784;There is a rainbow at the end of every trial you may be going through.
I:12654;785;This movie is very inspirational to anyone who may be going through a valley right now.
I:12654;786;It is a movie about hope, faith and struggles we all go through but it's also about winning the battles in our everyday life.
I:12654;787;I hope that as you watch this movie, you see yourself in some area of it and that you also find your strength to come out victorious at the end.
I:12654;788;I thought the movie was great.
I:12654;789;I enjoyed it very much and suggest anyone who likes Johnny Cash to watch it
I:12654;790;This is basically the love story between Johnny and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;791;Although there are scenes outside their relationship for example the accident involving Johnny's brother and how it shapes his relationship with his Mom and Dad, and also features to some degree his relationship with his ex wife.
I:12654;792;this is really the story of Johnny and June up until his concert at Folsom Prison.
I:12654;793;johnny Cash has a very distinctive look and sound that is hard to duplicate.
I:12654;794;For the most part Joaquin did the best job to try to emulate him.
I:12654;795;was she the perfect June Carter Cash?
I:12654;796;The two brought a lot of chemistry to their scenes together that made them believable.
I:12654;797;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon provide excellent performances.
I:12654;798;The screenplay is well written and the musical performances, performed by the actors, are authentic.
I:12654;799;Joaquin Phoenix was DEFINATELY overlooked for the the Oscar he so richly deserved in this film.
I:12654;800;it not only tells the story of Johnny, it tells the early days of Sun Records and the Nashville Music scene.
I:12654;801;GREAT movie, loved it, wish they would do a 2nd one when he was older.
I:12654;802;I think that Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job on his performance of Johnny Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was an excellent choice as June Carter I love this movie, I will watch it over and over again.
I:12654;803;I love Johnny Cash and had this movie when it first came out, but lost it in a move.
I:12654;804;I ordered a new one and watch it whenever the mood hits me.
I:12654;805;Good music and a great story.
I:12654;806;There's pretty much a requirement to target the 18.35 year.
I:12654;807;But, since Cash was one of those rare artists who can truly be called larger than life (and death), he found admirers in that age bracket in the last decade or so of his life.
I:12654;808;the result is a solid, enjoyable, and moving film that follows a familiar formula in celebrity biographies: big, pivotal scenes that show the protagonist's tough road to success, with less attention to the complex interaction of the individual artist with her or his culture.
I:12654;809;it's Hollywood when all's said and done, and I'd rather see actors interpret their roles than to try imitating the inimitable.
I:12654;810;Having said that, I'll stick with the general reaction and say that Witherspoon is more impressive than Phoenix because she is so much more natural and comfortable inside her character.
I:12654;811;photographed, and the production design captures the various eras well, even if the film exhibits the sort of slickness and polish that today's moviegoers demand.
I:12654;812;There is respect for Johnny Cash, along with an honest depiction of him as a deeply flawed, difficult man.
I:12654;813;Supporting performances are strong overall, with the actor playing Cash's grudge.
I:12654;814;holding father doing well with a pretty one.
I:12654;815;Most of all, there's the music, supervised by the great T. bone Burnett.
I:12654;816;Walk the Line is a good, not great movie, but it will undoubtedly bring more believers to the shrine of the Man in Black, one of the most important musicians and songwriters of the second half of the 20th century.
I:12654;817;Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.
I:12654;818;second image as part of a breezy visual montage.
I:12654;819;It's kind of a cute in.
I:12654;820;"I have never been a big fan of country music, but Johnny Cash has always skated over music borders
I:12654;821;I can't verify the authenticity of the movie content, but I sure know those songs!
I:12654;822;I never knew Reese Witherspoon had such a singing voice, either.
I:12654;823;I just wish I was able to see it at the time.
I:12654;824;"cheek hit, ""Boy Named Sue."""
I:12654;825;Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.
I:12654;826;Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run.
I:12654;827;and to watch this exceptional movie several times since: Joaquin Phoenix.
I:12654;828;I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him inGladiator.
I:12654;829;right down to the singer's deep baritone.
I:12654;830;Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever.
I:12654;831;it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.
I:12654;832;That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film: it's completely, unequivocally, believable.
I:12654;833;this was an absolutely wonderful film!
I:12654;834;Im not a big Cash fan, but this movie defiantely gives you a new appreciation of the man.
I:12654;835;The performances are amazing, the music is well done, and it really is a moving story!!
I:12654;836;this is a great film that's well worth the money!!!!
I:12654;837;This is a true story.
I:12654;838;Johnny Cash is played by Joaquin Phoenix, June Carter is played by Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;839;It's about one man's unwavering devotion to his sound, his message and the greatest love of his life.
I:12654;840;If you liked Johnny Cash, you will like this movie.
I:12654;841;I thought it was very entertaining.
I:12654;842;Both Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix really did a great job bringing the story to life.
I:12654;843;"she can act and act well
I:12654;844;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do an excellent job of portraying Johnny and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;845;Their acting makes the characters come to life.
I:12654;846;"For someone who was only vaguely familiar with the life of Johnny Cash, though I had heard many of his songs, ""Walk the Line"" gave me an insight into the life of this complex man."
I:12654;847;Walk the Line does not idolize Johnny Cash but rather casts him in an honest light, one that clearly shows both the good attributes and the character flaws of this man.
I:12654;848;"I think that ""Walk the Line"" is less a biopic about Johnny Cash than it is a love story, and the most touching and believable one I've seen since ""Brokeback Mountain""."
I:12654;849;earth charm and maternal kindness.
I:12654;850;Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance.
I:12654;851;"She plays June Carter as a complicated woman
I:12654;852;"After seeing ""Brokeback Mountain"" I asked myself why it was that the most believable love stories are always the sad ones."
I:12654;853;Walk the Line offers a convincing love story with a happy ending.
I:12654;854;This is a movie that benefits from two strong performances and chemistry between its leads.
I:12654;855;reese Witherspoon, who has become increasingly one.
I:12654;856;But the love these two people share is real and the music is wonderful.
I:12654;857;Enjoyed the movie the first time I bought it, and the extras make it even better.
I:12654;858;"WALK THE LINE is a look at the life of Johnny Cash (masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix), ""The Man In Black,"" one of the most well."
I:12654;859;known and distinctive singers of our time.
I:12654;860;divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).
I:12654;861;They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.
I:12654;862;This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.
I:12654;863;we hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).
I:12654;864;"These songs include ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" and ""Walk the Line."""
I:12654;865;deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter.
I:12654;866;The whole film is a great example of cinema storytelling at its best.
I:12654;867;everything from the luscious cinematography to the great script is truly in a class by itself.
I:12654;868;You will enjoy this film even if you aren't a Johnny Cash fan.
I:12654;869;I was moved a single time during the movie: when John's father cruelly told him that it should have been him who died.
I:12654;870;Walk the Line is a wonderful story of love and redemption.
I:12654;871;Reese Witherspoon deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is of equal caliber.
I:12654;872;It's a great movie, definitely worth seeing.
I:12654;873;After watching the film you would hope to see a revealing documentary about the real people.
I:12654;874;woven through the life on the road is John's growing love and obsession with June Carter.
I:12654;875;A young veteran of road life, Carter was the daughter of Maybelle Carter, perhaps one of this country's finest female musicians.
I:12654;876;A comedienne, Carter is portrayed as she has always been viewed.
I:12654;877;as a good and shining person, someone who could be held up to the light, someone who could help Johnny break away from the demons he ran into on the road, and during the lowest hiatus in his career.
I:12654;878;this movie, although a pretty accurate biopic about Johnny's life, is really the love story between Cash and June.
I:12654;879;"There's amazing chemistry between Johnny and June on the screen, during their duets (""Jackson"" is amazing!)"
I:12654;880;(The script DOES look at the creative songwriting process and explore what the writer was doing when they wrote one song each.
I:12654;881;"Folsom Prison by Johnny and ""Ring of Fire"" by June)."
I:12654;882;thumping Christian community that was the backbone of the Carter family's audience, subtly let June know how they felt about this seeming recklessness in her own life.
I:12654;883;This is beautifully portrayed in the film by an awkward moment between Witherspoon and a fan in a local store.
I:12654;884;in this film the director (James Mangold) lets the entire picture revolve around the characters' performances.
I:12654;885;An interesting character study with a look at some famous old musicians (Waylon Jennings, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc.) and how their lives were intertwined.
I:12654;886;Phoenix and young actress Reese Witherspoon are inspired and inspiring in their portrayals.
I:12654;887;He studied films of Johnny and has the strange stance of John holding a guitar.
I:12654;888;Witherspoon is a perfect counterpart .
I:12654;889;Both stars sing very well.
I:12654;890;The music is plentiful and stays with you long after you leave the theater.
I:12654;891;"like last year's ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"" is a vehicle for major performances, for career."
I:12654;892;It's definitely worth a trip to the theater, but 5 star performances don't compensate for an underwhelming script.
I:12654;893;So many actors and actresses impersonate real people, but with their performances, Witherspoon and Phoenix WERE the real people.
I:12654;894;I was also very pleased with the factual bases of the movie, as opposed to other biopics movies where Hollywood embellishes stories and takes liberties that are out of character or untrue to the subject.
I:12654;895;Burnett has cranked out phenomenal old.
I:12654;896;The icing on the cake is the fact that both Johnny and June had a hand in the movie before their passing in 2004, and their son, John Carter, had a lot impact in it as well.
I:12654;897;The timing was great too, because after 1968, where the movie ends, everything after that year is pretty well.
I:12654;898;known and documented about Cash and Carter, and is a part of our culture.
I:12654;899;Joaquin Phoenix takes on the early life and times of Johnny Cash, with something more than an assist from Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.
I:12654;900;It's great material, more factual than many dramaticized biopics, but seems like it's always standing just a hair away from fully embracing the man and his mythos.
I:12654;901;slightly imperfect take on Cash's legendary singing voice, had me seeing the Oscar nominee as a tremendous impersonator but not a living, breathing character unto himself.
I:12654;902;She's sweet, streetsmart and talented, and much of the trauma we endure from Cash's self.
I:12654;903;An ambitious picture that has its heart in the right place, but can't fully recover from a few crucial, disappointing near.
I:12654;904;I won't say much, except that this was a truly wonderful feature film.
I:12654;905;mC White said: Great film!
I:12654;906;"It was more than just one of noble ambition or grandeur of design
I:12654;907;This quote is from a fine article by [.]
I:12654;908;His spirit was scarred, busted, threadbare, but fearless, peaceable, witty and wise.
I:12654;909;But most of all, with soul.
I:12654;910;Johnny Cash will, like Will Rogers, stand forever as a symbol of intelligence, creativity, compassion and common sense.
I:12654;911;It's great movies like this are helping spark the interest of a younger generation.
I:12654;912;He was Johnny Cash, the Man in Black.
I:12654;913;"brilliant Joaquin Phoenix came pretty close in ""Walk The Line."""
I:12654;914;but Phoenix's eerily perfect performance elevates it.
I:12654;915;"Despite Vivian wanting him to get a ""real job,"" Cash successfully impressed a record executive with his gravelly voice and gritty songs ."
I:12654;916;June stepped in to save him from his downward spiral, inspiring him to clean up his life and go back on the road .
I:12654;917;But his true goal was her hand in marriage.
I:12654;918;tell the life story of one of America's most beloved singers, warts and all, without diminishing any of what made him great.
I:12654;919;and the triumph of the film is Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a scarily perfect performance as Cash.
I:12654;920;it's his ability to give a pitch.
I:12654;921;perfect imitation of Cash while also giving a powerful, heartfelt performance as an artistic soul covered in scars, who had to fight his way past everyone who doubted him.
I:12654;922;Walk the Like is a movie entirely revolving around the breathtaking performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who practically BECOMES Johnny Cash as few other actors ever could.
I:12654;923;Joaquin Phoenix was perfect in the role of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;924;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it was an excellent portrait of the singer and his life.
I:12654;925;From start to finish a job well done.
I:12654;926;Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film.
I:12654;927;"Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to ""Ray"" in treatment ."
I:12654;928;The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core.
I:12654;929;long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.
I:12654;930;reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real.
I:12654;931;life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern.
I:12654;932;"What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in ""Vanity Fair"" or her overachieving half."
I:12654;933;"spirit in ""Just Like Heaven"", are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks."
I:12654;934;"She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially ""Jackson"", are among the movie's best moments."
I:12654;935;Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing.
I:12654;936;As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no.
I:12654;937;it's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real.
I:12654;938;Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter.
I:12654;939;There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.
I:12654;940;the movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm.
I:12654;941;singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small.
I:12654;942;Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood filmmaking with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.
I:12654;943;Thes movie is by far the greatest movie of all time, it tells you about Johnny's love for music, addiction, depression, his love, and his whole life, highly recommend this!
I:12654;944;Really enjoyed the movie, thought both leads were somewhat believable.
I:12654;945;What a wonderful collection of music from The Man In Black.
I:12654;946;For Johnny Cash fans, it's great!
I:12654;947;Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix shine in an otherwise typical biopic.
I:12654;948;Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter (Cash).
I:12654;949;She lights up the screen whenever she arrives and the movie is more than worth watching just to see how talented she actually is.
I:12654;950;the music is great too, and Phoenix does a terrific job of nailing Cash's warbling, toned voice and his unmistakable swagger.
I:12654;951;This is by far one of my favorite biographies and love stories ever!
I:12654;952;Watched it right away and enjoyed it immensely.
I:12654;953;"The chemistry between the two leads was believable
I:12654;954;I really liked this movie.
I:12654;955;I was absolutly mesmerized by her believable portrayal of a transexual.
I:12654;956;It was an amazing show and I felt honored to be in the audience.
I:12654;957;Although it wasn't as good as the real thing, I think Joaquin did a very good job.
I:12654;958;I loved Joaquin as JR Cash, perfect depiction and Reese was marvelous also.
I:12654;959;I hope things worked out for her later and she found some happiness.
I:12654;960;That said, if you're looking at this film on paper, that's pretty much what you get, but if you actually watch the movie, you'll get a lot more out of it, mainly due to the film's two lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both of whom take over their real.
I:12654;961;life counterparts' personas entirely, and deliver two of the most resonant performances of the year.
I:12654;962;i found myself utterly swept away with this gritty yet utterly enchanting story of Jonny Cash and the story of the great love that grew between country stars Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career.
I:12654;963;Walk the Line is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co. writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;964;Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound.
I:12654;965;era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no.
I:12654;966;the film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter.
I:12654;967;From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history.
I:12654;968;"The severity of Ray Cash's ""it should have been you, J. r."" mentality will stay with Johnny Cash always, creeping into his songs and his medicine cabinet."
I:12654;969;the story is simple enough, and at times conventional.
I:12654;970;"is one of the more sheerly fun scenes in film this year
I:12654;971;With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life.
I:12654;972;This is a good thing.
I:12654;973;the dark parts, happy parts, and all .
I:12654;974;Very disappointing as some historic pictures and video of June and Johnny could have added some rich context for the movie.
I:12654;975;as it just cheapens an otherwise great movie.
I:12654;976;A handsome couple, very strong with period characters and great vocals makes us appreciate this acting.
I:12654;977;I watched this film with little knowledge of Cash's life and troubles, but walked away moved by his and June Carter's commitment to wrestle with life.
I:12654;978;Phoenix is one of my favorite actors of this generation, bringing depth and intensity to his roles.
I:12654;979;Witherspoon has always been a natural on the screen, but she truly shines in this story.
I:12654;980;The cinematography is also fantastic, capturing light and mood in a beautiful balance.
I:12654;981;i walked away from the movie challenged by the artistic drive of the characters, touched by the fearful acceptance of love by two hurting people, and wanting more Cash.
I:12654;982;Surely there's more rich material in this couple's history.
I:12654;983;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon who played Johnny Cash and June Carter were superb.
I:12654;984;The story line is interesting and really not a dull moment in the movie.
I:12654;985;Of course I recommend that you see this movie.
I:12654;986;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:12654;987;I learned a whole lot about Johnny Cash.
I:12654;988;Honestly this was a very touching movie, and it has something for everyone, whether you're a die hard fan of his, or someone like me.
I:12654;989;I'm not a movie reviewer but I am writing about this movie because I loved it.
I:12654;990;I loved the movie and I fell in love with Joaquin Phoenix.
I:12654;991;This movie will make him a huge star and a household name.
I:12654;992;Everyone everywhere will hear his name.
I:12654;993;He carries the movie very well along with Reese Witherspoon who already is a star.
I:12654;994;Joaquin Phoenix does all his own singing which impressed me very much.
I:12654;995;His presence on the screen is captivating.
I:12654;996;I recommend you watch this movie if you enjoy love stories, country music, any music, and just to watch the riveting performances of Joaquin and Reese.
I:12654;997;Good music and good story make for a very entertaining movie.
I:12654;998;It is nostalgic, filled with songs some of us grew up with.
I:12654;999;Songs that the newer generation will love too because they're so real.
I:12654;1000;Reese Witherspoon is great as June Carter and Joaquin Phoenix is Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1001;He really is the music legend of the 50s and 60s.
I:12654;1002;"I found myself very interested in the movie, mostly becauseof the ""freight train"" sound of early, rockabilly Cash."
I:12654;1003;The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).
I:12654;1004;The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.
I:12654;1005;Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could'vebeen a bit more dynamic in the approach.
I:12654;1006;My husband enjoys Johnny Cash music, so my son got this for him for Christmas and we all enjoyed watching the movie.
I:12654;1007;I love and am interested in all things Johnny and June.
I:12654;1008;This definitely does their life justice.
I:12654;1009;both Joaquin and Reese were phenomenal!
I:12654;1010;Truly an amazing story and journey and a GREAT movie to boot!
I:12654;1011;Accomplishing a credible southern accent is far from qualifying for an Oscar performance.
I:12654;1012;I've dealt with this seller before and always had great results.
I:12654;1013;A breakthrough of history and music down the hard and dirty journey of the original Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1014;jaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job in filling the big shoes of the rock legend.
I:12654;1015;He's so convincing that, at times, I had to remember that he was an actor and not the real Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1016;reese witherspoon, in a depature from her regular movies, plays a convincing June Carter who is slightly interested in the mysterious, yet humble, sometimes crazy confident Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1017;It's a really great movie.
I:12654;1018;This movie makes the legend of Johnny Cash come alive!!!
I:12654;1019;Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships.
I:12654;1020;"hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner ""Crash"")."
I:12654;1021;the most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted.
I:12654;1022;Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity.
I:12654;1023;Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky.
I:12654;1024;dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success.
I:12654;1025;"Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was ""Jackson"")."
I:12654;1026;the film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music.
I:12654;1027;however, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.
I:12654;1028;Make an excellent movie that is.
I:12654;1029;So many people have done fine reviews of this film that I only wish to comment on one scene, not a terribly profound one, but nonetheless one that touched me deeply.
I:12654;1030;"I'm Johnny Cash.Steller performances and a gripping adapted soundtrack make ""Walk the Line"" one of the best films I personally have seen in a long time."
I:12654;1031;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon display radiant chemistry starring together as legendary country music icons Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1032;The story weaves inside the life and mind of musically.
I:12654;1033;"driven Cash who is swarmed into the spotlight with his ""sharp like a razor"" sound."
I:12654;1034;June Carter (played by a magnificent Witherspoon) acts as a mentor and inspiration to Cash, as well as his soul mate for whom he is very much in love with.
I:12654;1035;Wow, from the very first moment I have to say I was completely taken aback.
I:12654;1036;It was riveting, and immediately I knew this was going to be a wonderful film.
I:12654;1037;jaoquin Phoenix was captivating as Cash, and I was impressed with the depth of similarities between him and his character.
I:12654;1038;Whether he meant these details to impact or not, Joaquin's performance is so honest and raw, one MUST draw the parallels.
I:12654;1039;But alone the performance is inspired and he well deserved the Golden Globe.
I:12654;1040;I could really relate and connect with her character.
I:12654;1041;screen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was so strong and poignant.
I:12654;1042;last but certainly not least is the music, which acts as the third character in this bio.
I:12654;1043;Phoenix and Witherspoon as you know put their own singing skills to the test here, and the result is amazing!
I:12654;1044;I will be the first to admit country music is CERTAINLY not my thing, but even I found Cash's melodies and the actors' impression of them captivating.
I:12654;1045;Walk the Line exceeded all my expectations and was a truly insightful, inspiring and moving love story.
I:12654;1046;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon light up the silver screen and put in the finest performances so far in their careers.
I:12654;1047;It's a film about self acceptance and companionship, that will certainly move you and make you think twice about country music.
I:12654;1048;"From it's thrilling beginning to it's heartwarming end, ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful film!"
I:12654;1049;Covering the career of a legend is never an easy task, but this film more than delivers.
I:12654;1050;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver believable and incredible performances as Johnny and June Carter Cash and completely fooled this reviewer, who was astonished to find that their vocals weren't dubbed.
I:12654;1051;Honest and forthright, this is a heartwarming tribute to one of the most enduring love affairs in country music history.
I:12654;1052;"(SPOILERS)""Walk the Line"" has one of the finest scenes i've ever seen in any movie."
I:12654;1053;toward the end, we see Johnny hosting a family gathering.
I:12654;1054;Johnny then walks away, suggesting his pappy tell his granddaughters a story.
I:12654;1055;every boy in America knows the string has to be pulled taught to carry sound between two cups.
I:12654;1056;an incredibly rich, yet economical, scene.
I:12654;1057;pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self.
I:12654;1058;"In this regard, ""Walk the Line"" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her)."
I:12654;1059;Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional.
I:12654;1060;"I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent (""Election"") but with her role in ""Walk the Line"" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration."
I:12654;1061;Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.
I:12654;1062;This is an amazing movie.
I:12654;1063;The acting, the story, and definitely the music work very well and make this movie incredible.
I:12654;1064;Once again, the actors were fantastic and everyone fit their role perfectly.
I:12654;1065;R. patrick was great as John's dad, he isn't given enough credit, but he did a great job in his role.
I:12654;1066;"I found ""Walk the Line"" in the bargain bins at a nearby Wal."
I:12654;1067;I snatched it up in an instant.
I:12654;1068;Walk the Line was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;1069;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing!
I:12654;1070;The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close.
I:12654;1071;All of the other musical performers were outstanding.
I:12654;1072;The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done.
I:12654;1073;I particularly liked the 50s.
I:12654;1074;Where did they get them all?The story was captivating.
I:12654;1075;It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door.
I:12654;1076;door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super.
I:12654;1077;It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here.
I:12654;1078;And the story really got a good grip on the heart.
I:12654;1079;This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly.
I:12654;1080;Walk the Line is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour.
I:12654;1081;It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.
I:12654;1082;They did a really good job, I reckon.
I:12654;1083;They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it.
I:12654;1084;You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives.
I:12654;1085;the direction is really great, I thought.
I:12654;1086;The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man.
I:12654;1087;It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well.
I:12654;1088;definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers.
I:12654;1089;I love a true, real life love story.
I:12654;1090;Makes you remember that we can all find our soul mate , that one true love.
I:12654;1091;Having just seen the movie for the second time,just in time for the Oscars,I can truly say that this is one of the best musical biopics I've ever seen.
I:12654;1092;"the ""Man In Black"" stands tall next to last year's ""Ray"" as a testiment to the power of a well told story."
I:12654;1093;"for this generation of movie goers,""Walk The Line"" is a real eye."
I:12654;1094;opener in terms of showing younger audiences just how powerful an impact Johnny Cash made in the music world.
I:12654;1095;"in the case of ""Ray"",it was how a person with a disability could overcome to achieve great things."
I:12654;1096;"in ""Walk The Line"",the moral center of this tale is how the love of a good woman can save a man's soul."
I:12654;1097;aside from being a great romantic tale,the film also serves as a lesson in music history.
I:12654;1098;i wonder if any of them went out and got one of his Greatest Hits Collections.
I:12654;1099;the same goes with Reese's singing and portrayal of June Carter.
I:12654;1100;"but I think her portrayal proves that she can act outside of ""fluffy"" romantic comedies."
I:12654;1101;if you're looking for a damn good,not to mention entertaining,biopic.
I:12654;1102;Walk The Line fills the bill.
I:12654;1103;This was an enjoyable and engaging movie from start to finish.
I:12654;1104;I loved the music most of all and thought that Joaquin and Reese did a more than adequate job with the vocals.
I:12654;1105;star status of June and Johnny Cash, those were tall boots to fill!
I:12654;1106;(another B comes to mind actually).
I:12654;1107;well folks I am now 42 years old, a musician and still very much in awe of the Man In Black, no one had a voice like him and he was an amazing storyteller and songwriter.
I:12654;1108;With the exception of maybe Mr Hank Williams, Mr J Cash is in a league of his own, as one of the most unique singers to ever emerge from the American C&W scene.
I:12654;1109;with that said Walk the Line, the James Mangold directed Johnny Cash bio.
I:12654;1110;this film reminded me very much of Great Balls of Fire,the Jerry Lee Lewis bio.
I:12654;1111;pic with a very inspiring performance by Dennis Quade as the killer.
I:12654;1112;Phoenix's performance of the Man in black is stellar and incendiary, you really get the feeling he has pulled out all stops to walk a mile(or better still walk the line) in the great mans shoes.
I:12654;1113;although he never really looks exactly like JC, except for maybe when Johnny was young, he has enough of the great man's Cashism's down, to help make the character convincing and real enough.
I:12654;1114;while it comes as no surprise, Reese Witherspoon does an amazing job of playing June Carter Cash, the often overshadowed offsping of America's answer to country music's royal family, the Carter's.
I:12654;1115;the soundtrack is great with musical direction coming from Mr T Bone Burnette so he knows what he is doing,this includes all the incidental tracks that he has chosen as well, to match the periods etc.
I:12654;1116;I'm still not sure)Witherspoon's singing voice that was stronger and it won me over more than Phoenix's effort.
I:12654;1117;in all fairness though, Phoenix's singing was still credible and to try and impersonate one of the most unique voices on the planet is a tall order for anyone,my hat still goes of to him.
I:12654;1118;also of note I must give mention to the stunning costumes and set direction,they have done an excellent job and it is a real treat for all you hardcore retrophiles and atomic stylists.
I:12654;1119;enjoy the movie folks and I hope all this inept rambling will be of use too some off the people out there.
I:12654;1120;Beautifully done and a true masterpiece.
I:12654;1121;You can tell the work that they put in to transform this Film into an amazing journey.
I:12654;1122;You will see and understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for best Actress.
I:12654;1123;Walk the Line is a great movie.
I:12654;1124;It pays tribute to an iconic husband and wife team.
I:12654;1125;"It was very heartwarming to see that the ""man in black"" had a vulnerable side and had such a love for June."
I:12654;1126;"It didn't scream with power the way ""Ray"" did last year, but this is a pretty good film."
I:12654;1127;"In ""Ray"", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women."
I:12654;1128;I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame.
I:12654;1129;"joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job
I:12654;1130;her best role to date.
I:12654;1131;This is an extremely well done biopic, that limits itself to the early career of Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;1132;made things a little too clear, in that sometimes the connections between his actions and his childhood are so strong that it's like the screenwriter went in with a highlighter and marked the passages for you.
I:12654;1133;while almost distracting, such clear connections don't get in the way of the story, and the screenwriters have done a great job in concentrating on the love story between Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1134;Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderfully understated in their portrayals, especially in the darker sections which has to be one of the better representations on screen of drug and alcohol addiction.
I:12654;1135;If anything, this movie leaves you wanting more, to see a more complete life of Cash, and if anything, that's a triumph in itself.
I:12654;1136;Captured Johnny Cash and helped explain the man himself.
I:12654;1137;The incredible job turned in by all the actors was riviting!
I:12654;1138;Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office.
I:12654;1139;Yes, his life and career are notable .
I:12654;1140;And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter .
I:12654;1141;"In this heart warming movie that will make you say, ""Awwwww!"""
I:12654;1142;A happy ending with some suspense and romance.
I:12654;1143;This is a MUST SEE!
I:12654;1144;"Mr. Phoenix for my is in the top 10 male performances ever you only had to see him in Gladiator to know what i am talking about, I love Reese Whiterspoon too, she is very talented, without a doubt my favorite actress ever(both Joaquin and Reese are my favorite actors) and his chacter in the movie was lovely, their make a great duo like Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall in Brokeback Mountain,the music is ""Perfect,Outstanding, Superab."""
I:12654;1145;", one things i like in this movie is the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon thats make the film so powerfull and Flawless ,direction was ""fantastic"" this movie deserves to be nominated for best picture too, Walk the line by far is my favorite flick of this year,there another excellent movies in 2005 like King Kong, Sin City, Star Wars episode 3, Brokeback Mountain, Crash,Munich."
I:12654;1146;i like them but Walk The Line will be my favorite of 2005 and one of my favorites of all time.
I:12654;1147;biographical story of Johnny Cash becoming a country singerand meeting country singer love, June Carter.
I:12654;1148;This special edition has nice picture and sound plusneat extras.
I:12654;1149;I recommend this good drama.
I:12654;1150;Walk the Line was a fantastic film based on everyone's favorite bad ass, one John R. Cash.
I:12654;1151;But at the same time it is so much more than that.
I:12654;1152;It is a love story, it is a redemption story, it is a story about being a human being.
I:12654;1153;Johnny's story is so great because it is a wonderfully human story about making mistakes and finding those people in life who help to rise you above yourself and your weaknesses.
I:12654;1154;Johnny Cash is a perfect example of an everyman.
I:12654;1155;He had his trials by fire, but he became a man who touched so many lives with his straight ahead, no frills, honest music.
I:12654;1156;That is what makes the film so great.
I:12654;1157;Yes many will notice that the film rarely aspires to high art, i. e. groundbreaking cinematography, and such, but that is what gives it its charm.
I:12654;1158;Much like Johnny's songs this film doesn't need the frills to be a great film, and that is what makes both it and Johnny's music so artful.
I:12654;1159;i guess one must be in the right mood for this type of movie.
I:12654;1160;A lot has been made of the performances of the leads and of the two Phoenix's keeps the film watchable.
I:12654;1161;"Walk the Line is a run of the ""Hollywood"" mill romance movie disguised as an honest look at a great musical figure and the role his talented wife and their lives and struggles."
I:12654;1162;These two won awards for their performances.
I:12654;1163;If you like country and western you should watch and listen to this one.
I:12654;1164;highly recommended for fans of Johnny Cash and country and western.
I:12654;1165;The disc is marked as Region B, but is actually All Regions.
I:12654;1166;The Spanish title is Johnny and June: Madness and Passion.
I:12654;1167;the relationship with June is very well developed.
I:12654;1168;I can only say that it's a perfectly believable love story.
I:12654;1169;"The music throughout is well chosen and this morning I woke up with Ring of Fire echoing around my mind (which makes a pleasant change from ""Can't get you out of my head"".)"
I:12654;1170;Fantastic performances all round, a great soundtrack and a gripping story make for a very memorable film.
I:12654;1171;While I didn't care too much for parts of the movie, he is still a great singer and Reese Witherspoon and J. Phoenix do a good job with their roles.
I:12654;1172;i also believe that Reese Witherspoon's Oscar for this movie was 200% deserved and .
I:12654;1173;Still I find it so difficult to believe the actors did the actual singing in this, but its great either way, great cast, true story, great movie.
I:12654;1174;Reese and Joaquin absolutely own the screen in this exceptional movie.
I:12654;1175;This lent to the authenticity of the film.
I:12654;1176;Huge fan of Johnny Cash and his music.
I:12654;1177;this movie fits the bill any time I want to relax and enjoy the music as well.
I:12654;1178;well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.
I:12654;1179;I was thoroughly entertained by Walk the Line, James Mangold's attempt to be the first cinematic commentary on the recently deceased Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1180;The acting and singing were superb.
I:12654;1181;T. Bone Burnett's musical production is often mesmerizing.
I:12654;1182;That said, Witherspoon's acting and singing are strong in the role she plays as a coquettish country legend occasionally pestered by Christian guilt.
I:12654;1183;like sketch smarts are admirable.
I:12654;1184;I was in awe of Joaquin Phoenix's masterful portrayal of the Man in Black.
I:12654;1185;In a sense, this narrative choice makes the film a narrow psychological study.
I:12654;1186;picking origins, a harsh father, a close and protective older brother, and his love of early country on the radio, where his love for June Carter begins.
I:12654;1187;You took the wrong son, he cries in a poignant scene that forever marks young Johnny's future.
I:12654;1188;"And Cash's response, ""Maybe I am"" is traced to this original event: his brother's death/funeral."
I:12654;1189;the other major force propelling Cash's life is his love for June Carter.
I:12654;1190;As children, he and his brother hear the girl's beautiful voice as she sings on the radio with her famous family.
I:12654;1191;There the seed of love is planted.
I:12654;1192;After weakly opposing Cash's dream to live by the sweat of his guitar, she figures out that what she really wants is a family man and the attention that any kind of spouse deserves.
I:12654;1193;June Carter, on the other hand, is portrayed as a strong woman, caring yet determined, and able to reconcile her own choices with the judgments of others.
I:12654;1194;circulated films with big stars and budgets.
I:12654;1195;Ah, the pleasure of fairy tale closure.
I:12654;1196;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1197;I think Joaquin Phoenix is just a terrific actor, and Reese Witherspoon really impressed me with this role (I never liked any of her other movie performances).
I:12654;1198;This movie was enjoyable and I'm really glad I went to see it.
I:12654;1199;All in all, this was a good movie.
I:12654;1200;I wish there was a little more singing, but I still enjoyed it.
I:12654;1201;Thanks you for your service in this issue
I:12654;1202;I like the movie because it kept it real.
I:12654;1203;They enjoyed the movie and said they saw the mistakes they have been making in the past and can't continue living like that.
I:12654;1204;They are changing their life style because of the movie,I love the movie because it kept it real.
I:12654;1205;He enjoyed the movie because he was able to see himself in it and the mistakes he made in the past.
I:12654;1206;The movie, Walk The Line changed his lifestyle.
I:12654;1207;This is a great movie.
I:12654;1208;The shrink wrap was removed but works just fine.
I:12654;1209;My whole family is a fan of Johnny Cash, and the way Hollywood portrayed the Man in Black is almost sickening.
I:12654;1210;If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and want to stay that way.
I:12654;1211;Nice movie with great performance.
I:12654;1212;Cash was clearly a special man, who became an American icon.
I:12654;1213;"Pheonix and Witherspoon portrayed their characters with respect and dedication
I:12654;1214;The Director's commentary is also a walk through history, superbly delivered.
I:12654;1215;i thought the movie did a reasonable job of portraying the early part of his life, up to where he married June.
I:12654;1216;Throughout the movie I believed in her character and the accolades she got for her role were well deserved.
I:12654;1217;the music is good and pretty well done.
I:12654;1218;if you like Johnny Cash, or just fifties and sixties country music you will probably appreciate it.
I:12654;1219;The music was engaging and Mr. Phoenix hit the mark!
I:12654;1220;This is a terrific film that captures the essence of Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter.
I:12654;1221;He deserved the Oscar as Best Actor.
I:12654;1222;Can't say she was Oscar worthy either.
I:12654;1223;Joaquin is a fine actor with true expression and depth .
I:12654;1224;I look forward to seeing him in more riveting roles.
I:12654;1225;The package was like new.
I:12654;1226;Excellent move that should have won both the Oscar!
I:12654;1227;This is an excellent movie with Oscar winning performances by both actors.
I:12654;1228;I love Walk the Line because it was about my favorite singer Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1229;Joaquin and Reese did a wonderful job of playing Johnny and June.
I:12654;1230;I am gald that Reese and Joaquin won a Golden Globe award for best actress and actor for Walk the Line.
I:12654;1231;Joaquin is my favorite actor and Reese is my favorite actress.
I:12654;1232;My Mom and I saw Walk the Line at the movies and I liked Walk the Line.
I:12654;1233;I also bought Walk the Line Soundtrack.
I:12654;1234;Joaquin and Reese sung better than the real Johnny and June Carter Cash in Walk the Line
I:12654;1235;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so good in this film.
I:12654;1236;The music, the period design, the story were just fantastic.
I:12654;1237;Riveting and heartbreaking story about the power of true love.
I:12654;1238;The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film.
I:12654;1239;The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it.
I:12654;1240;the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win, Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her).
I:12654;1241;Overall the film is good and I recomand it you will be mesmerized at times through the film.
I:12654;1242;Johnny Cash is practically a household name, and even if you aren't into fifties music you're bound to recognize some of his songs, like Ring of Fire and I Walk the Line.
I:12654;1243;a good film but not my cup of tea.
I:12654;1244;The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1245;There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.
I:12654;1246;The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.
I:12654;1247;a deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.
I:12654;1248;The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.
I:12654;1249;Her singing voice is also marvelous.
I:12654;1250;"Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the Carter/Cash duet ""Jackson"" twice in the movie, and nail it both times."
I:12654;1251;rack movie biography, and becomes something truly magical.
I:12654;1252;I have watched this one a few times and enjoy it on every viewing.
I:12654;1253;The songs are great and the story is interesting.
I:12654;1254;I went in knowing little of Johnny Cash's earlier music, save Ring Of Fire and I Walk The Line, however, coming out of the movie I found myself humming the tunes to Jackson, Cocaine Blues, and Folsom Prision Blues.
I:12654;1255;all in all, Walk The Line was the most emotionally engrossing experience I had at the movie theatre last year.
I:12654;1256;I reecomend it to anyone and everyone.
I:12654;1257;Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness.
I:12654;1258;favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage.
I:12654;1259;Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter.
I:12654;1260;The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years.
I:12654;1261;The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.
I:12654;1262;Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash.
I:12654;1263;What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts.
I:12654;1264;The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.
I:12654;1265;if it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.
I:12654;1266;But as the movie rolled I saw think he captured Cash very well.
I:12654;1267;And Reese Witherspoon astonished,us all with a superb performance.
I:12654;1268;We loved the sanpshots of Elvis and others including Jerry Lee Lewis.
I:12654;1269;"Walk The Line, written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold
I:12654;1270;"Walk The Line will inevitably be compared (at least from now until Oscar time) with ""Ray"", Taylor Hackford's popular biopic of Ray Charles."
I:12654;1271;Is it a better movie?
I:12654;1272;The answers, at least for me, vary quite at bit.
I:12654;1273;Perhaps because I have no knowledge of June Carter's music, Reese Witherspoon's singing is far more successful.
I:12654;1274;"in general, though, I think ""Walk the Line"" is a more satisfying film than ""Ray""."
I:12654;1275;"What truly sets ""Walk The Line"" apart, though, isn't the music or the plot, but the choices of what the filmmakers decided to show us."
I:12654;1276;This bookends the film, with the main body of the story spanning about thirty years.
I:12654;1277;"This familiar chain of events is a weakness, and keeps ""Walk"" from being a truly great movie."
I:12654;1278;its main strength is that it doesn't try to encapsule all of Cash's life, but chooses instead to focus on one of its most emotional, sympathetic periods.
I:12654;1279;His long term romance with June Carter is the film's true body, culminating in her acceptance of his proposal in 1969.
I:12654;1280;Reese Witherspoon is terrific in the role, giving the film much of its spark and spine.
I:12654;1281;It's a lively, heartfelt performance that makes Mr. Phoenix's passionate pursuit of her so convincing.
I:12654;1282;Their chemistry together is strong, providing the film with extra heat.
I:12654;1283;Walk also gets more help from its supporting characters.
I:12654;1284;"While ""Ray's"" supporting cast had a tendency to fade into the background, ""Walk The Line"" has a better spread of memorable performances, especially Waylon Payne's Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dallas Roberts making the most of his brief appearance as Sam Phillips."
I:12654;1285;the use of music in the film is also strong, supporting the emotions of the content, rather than receding (as can often happen) into montage wallpaper.
I:12654;1286;"in the end, ""Walk The Line"" has its flaws, but is still a compelling and emotional story."
I:12654;1287;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver two of the greatest performances of recent memory in this powerful film about one of country music's biggest stars: Johnny Cash.Young Johnny took an early interest in music while growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm during the great depression of the 1930s.
I:12654;1288;His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).
I:12654;1289;after the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).
I:12654;1290;"stage performances of such great songs as ""Jackson"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Ring of Fire"" (which was written by June)."
I:12654;1291;He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.
I:12654;1292;this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:12654;1293;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.
I:12654;1294;Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.
I:12654;1295;Her voice is excellent as well.
I:12654;1296;The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.
I:12654;1297;Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics.
I:12654;1298;i give this movie my highest recommendation.
I:12654;1299;Watch and see the rise and struggles of a country music legend.
I:12654;1300;Other than that, it's fine.
I:12654;1301;"This has become obvious after watching the delicious duo of ""Ray"" and ""Walk The Line""."
I:12654;1302;I look forward to seeing my life on the silver screen and providing the opportunity for a young actor to win an Oscar.
I:12654;1303;This is johnny cash side of his story very accurate and i love this movie he was the shizzle back in his day
I:12654;1304;I ordered this movie and it came quickly and plays good.
I:12654;1305;This movie was very well cast.
I:12654;1306;Joaquin really does a great job, and Reese is great all around.
I:12654;1307;and I thought she did a great job, too.
I:12654;1308;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:12654;1309;I've always loved Johnny Cash and the whole story.
I:12654;1310;It is definitely worth adding to the movie collection!
I:12654;1311;reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich d bumpkin.
I:12654;1312;the chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on.
I:12654;1313;Rarely I feel that in this film.
I:12654;1314;I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.
I:12654;1315;this film far exceeded my expectations and with a true feeling of satisfaction.
I:12654;1316;drawer as, surprisingly, is their singing.
I:12654;1317;overall though, it's a pretty good film.
I:12654;1318;My Wife, Son and Myself viewed the movie.
I:12654;1319;Made even better on high definition.
I:12654;1320;"ray gets carried away with the extra
I:12654;1321;I saw the movie last night and enjoyed it as much as any movie I've seen in a long time.
I:12654;1322;"being a Country Music fan for 60 years,I have had a lot of favourites but when all's said and done Cash, in my opinion, is the best of the best
I:12654;1323;even Cash,as great as he was,never accomplished as much in any short period as did Williams.
I:12654;1324;the bottom line is that June Carter was the strength that held JR together and gave him the will to continue and become the great success that he was.
I:12654;1325;the foundation of that strengh was faith and love.
I:12654;1326;"this movie is excellent in showing the single factor that had the biggest inpact on John's life
I:12654;1327;I am a Johnny Cash fan, a June Carter fan, a Joaquin Phoenix fan and a Reese Witherspoon adorer but, folks, if there ever was a standard.
I:12654;1328;holler persona and very little hint of beauty in her face, body or the way she dressed.
I:12654;1329;When Johnny Cash came into her life a Cinderella transformation occurred.
I:12654;1330;She became a beautiful, poised true artist, and that is I believe as many do because Johnny Cash was the first person in her life to see that beautiful, that poise and that artistry.
I:12654;1331;Growing up in both a famous family and poverty and with endless expectations of what a girl and woman should be, June was a deep soul, often melancholy and wistful.
I:12654;1332;"reese Witherspoon captures barely anything of the real June
I:12654;1333;The photography and cinematography are gorgeous and the music is spot.
I:12654;1334;Her performance is capable but a far piece down the road from an Oscar moment, though I have no doubt she could deliver many Oscar moments.
I:12654;1335;"In fact, I think ""Legally Blonde"" is a more important film, even though it is a comedy and Oscar has always had a tough time rewarding comedy."
I:12654;1336;still, this film is well.
I:12654;1337;It is close to a perfect movie.
I:12654;1338;joaquin and Reese really put a lot into their performances.
I:12654;1339;I was skeptical about them doing their own singing when I heard about it, but they did a super job.
I:12654;1340;While they're clearly no Johnny and June, the two's singing fits in perfectly with the movie.
I:12654;1341;Anyway, I was very satisfied with this.
I:12654;1342;I recommend it to any Johnny Cash fan, or to anybody, for that matter.
I:12654;1343;Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl.
I:12654;1344;All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.
I:12654;1345;reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress.
I:12654;1346;I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period.
I:12654;1347;It's their best work in their entire careers.
I:12654;1348;Without any computer generated special effects in sight this is the rare big budget movie that succeeds due to the actors.
I:12654;1349;the story about the rise of Johnny Cash and his one true love is nothing surprising or groundbreaking but it's the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon that make it special.
I:12654;1350;the two have great chemistry together onstage and off and give enjoyable renditions of classic songs.
I:12654;1351;maybe not everything in this biopic is historically accurate but Johnny himself would've approved how they captured the intensity of his love for June.
I:12654;1352;"Walk the Line did what ""Ray"" did with regards to bringing forth music, that not of my generation and the trials and tribulations of life while bringing that music to its fans."
I:12654;1353;"I am not a big Ray Charles fan, I like his unique voice and some of his ballads were very sentimental and the movie ""Ray"" was a good adaptation of his life, as I have known it through reading and such."
I:12654;1354;I can understand why Mr. Phoenix did not win best actor, because there were a lot of great actors there and I know that he will get his some day.
I:12654;1355;The acting was superb, the chemistry, the script, everything.
I:12654;1356;I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Drama driven films, though there was some levity from Mrs. Witherspoon, anyone who are fans of the two lead actors and anyone who can appreciate a true work of art or anyone who likes country music and Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1357;First of all let me make a statement.
I:12654;1358;Then a funny thing happened.
I:12654;1359;The acting was extremely good, The story was interesting, and the dialog was well above average.
I:12654;1360;Pheonix has proven to be an exceptional actor.
I:12654;1361;Both Pheonix and Witherspoon gave a very convincing performance.
I:12654;1362;"I'm still not a C&W
I:12654;1363;I haven't read the autobiography on which the movie was based, but Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do an incredible job of telling the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in a way that draws you in and makes you feel like you know them personally.
I:12654;1364;Phoenix and Witherspoon impress with their vocal talents, performing the songs themselves.
I:12654;1365;This film from its onset is amazing from its attention to detail, the story itself from Johnny Cashes small beginnings to the legend he would become (& all that went with it) and of course the woman who was the love of his life an oscar winning performance by Reece Witherspoon.
I:12654;1366;excellent cast Dallas Roberts also gets his chance to shine the road to redemption through June for Cash and most of all the love between two people which made the last half hour of this film so moving.
I:12654;1367;highly recommend and one of the finest and greatest films hollywood has made in years forget Brokeback Mountain and Crash this film has something else something that those two could give there back teeth for and though crually overlooked at the oscars.
I:12654;1368;this is one film worth going back to again and again and Jauquin Phoenix deserves an oscar just as much as Reese maybe someday!
I:12654;1369;Anyway terrific film on all counts and it perfectly summund up the era and the music.
I:12654;1370;Now I see why Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar.
I:12654;1371;If you don't like country music you'll find this drags in spots, but overall it's an engrossing story.
I:12654;1372;Phoenix and Witherspoon are two of the rising stars of Hollywood and it is a pure pleasure to see them shine in this picture.
I:12654;1373;It's amazing how musically talented the two are also and how well they blended together.
I:12654;1374;She is putting out marvelous music, much improved from her early years.
I:12654;1375;This is a must see for those who enjoy a good love story.
I:12654;1376;"The obstacles we overcome is what makes a love story great and ""Walk The Line"" does just that."
I:12654;1377;Reese Witherspoon was wonderful as always but Phoenix may very well have taken the lead from Reese.
I:12654;1378;Reese and Phoenix found a hidden music talent.
I:12654;1379;He was worth the wait.
I:12654;1380;I think June Carter's mother knew she loved Johnny before she ever admitted it to herself.
I:12654;1381;The performances in this film are awesome.
I:12654;1382;phonix and Reese Witherspoon are wonderful together as Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1383;The chemistry between the two feels very real and natural.
I:12654;1384;June Carter was an amazing woman and artist and Reese Withespoon gives you a sense of both her talent, grit, and vulnerability.
I:12654;1385;Good as she was, Reese Witherspoon's performance didn't seem worthy of a best actress Oscar.
I:12654;1386;as enjoyable as the movie was, I found myself getting restless by the second half.
I:12654;1387;"so great performances, nice sense of ""being there"" during some CW history in the making but leaves an enormous gap between the elderly Cash who had come to a level of peace with his demons and the more experienced but still wrestling with demons Cash we see at the end of the film."
I:12654;1388;What an overwhelming, sentimental journey back in time.
I:12654;1389;I cried and felt the love now my mother felt then in the 60s for the music and heart and soul these two wonderful characters portrayed in what I will say to be one of the best must see movies ever.
I:12654;1390;Reese is flawless and Joaquin is the soul embodiment of Johnny.
I:12654;1391;"Sorry you ""Ray"" movie supporters."
I:12654;1392;now THAT is real acting.
I:12654;1393;As good this time around as it was the first.
I:12654;1394;This movie is definitely the best movie.
I:12654;1395;The story of John and June is phenominal.
I:12654;1396;With Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's chemistry being electrified on screen, you get a sense of real love by their characters.
I:12654;1397;At the end, the leads have won you over.
I:12654;1398;It's the two leads lively, often witty repartee that got my interest and kept it.
I:12654;1399;I have to say I really admire the determination of Johnny Cash as he pursues the girl of his dreams and her refusal makes Johnny more determined then ever to make her his.
I:12654;1400;'Walk The Line' marks my second special screening of a Reese Witherspoon film before the official release date.
I:12654;1401;It is a story of love, but also many others that this 'Walk The Line' film travels along, and sometimes crosses over, as it explores the entertaining life of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1402;"All I knew of this film before I saw it, was the poster art of Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon in a passionate embrace, as they bask in the warmth of the spotlight together
I:12654;1403;As well as one preview for the film, which includes a totally cool still of the actors of today as their characters in a black and white comic book black line drawing sketch, as their names appear on the screen giving the preview a really neat edge.
I:12654;1404;it took seven years for 'Walk The Line' to come to the screen.
I:12654;1405;One of the best things about 'Walk The Line' is the real people also got to pick who they wanted to play them in the film.
I:12654;1406;Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for Johnny Cash, who decided on him after enjoying Joaquin's performance in 'Gladiator'.
I:12654;1407;June Carter you certainly know talent when you see it!
I:12654;1408;Amazingly to some both actors really sing and play, and it was equally hard at times for each individual actor, but both Joaquin and Reese really smoulder together, and it's a real joy watching them work together.
I:12654;1409;It was something I hoped for while watching the film.
I:12654;1410;I also really enjoy Reese's scenes with the autoharp even though that was a difficult instrument for her, however you'd never know because she pulls it off effortlessly.
I:12654;1411;I'm already a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon's work, but here all her excellent work in previous films is put to the test and she succeeds with a performance I'm very proud of.
I:12654;1412;I never see it happening, but just for fun, and to prove how popular this movie seems here are a few examples.
I:12654;1413;I read an article about Amanda Bynes, who loves physical comedy, but during an interview for her film 'She's The Man' wanted an Oscar one day like Reese Witherspoon recieved for 'Walk the Line'.
I:12654;1414;She won a role in 'Walk The Line' where, though it's serious content, she was playing a goofy character.
I:12654;1415;"I feel I could easily do that."""
I:12654;1416;'Walk The Line' goes it's own path and takes it's time getting there but it's worth the long haul.
I:12654;1417;Purhaps best of all is the fact you don't have to love country music to enjoy this film.
I:12654;1418;This is a film worth waiting in line for.
I:12654;1419;I've no doubt in my mind 'Walk The Line' will become a classic in years to come.
I:12654;1420;I feel the real Johnny Cash and June Carter would commend this film and be so proud of their choice of actors, who keep their spirit alive, as both actors step out onto the stage and glow like the angels the real singers have now become, they are forever immortalised in the warm radiant glow of bright lights on the silver screen for all to now admire, desire, and aspire.
I:12654;1421;This allows me to take advantage of the excellent soundtrack and great T Bone Burnett musical arrangements.
I:12654;1422;That said both actors did remarkably excellent jobs singing.
I:12654;1423;Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them.
I:12654;1424;So, it's okay and I recommend it.
I:12654;1425;Actors did a great job with this one, I can't think of a better pair.
I:12654;1426;Good movie about the life of Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter.
I:12654;1427;I found it very entertaining.
I:12654;1428;After you watch it, you need to watch Walk Hard: The Drewey Cox Story for a great laugh.
I:12654;1429;This film pretty acutatly displays cash's life .
I:12654;1430;Both phenix and witherspoon play their parts well .
I:12654;1431;The wife rates it a five every time she sees it (at least 20 times so far), but I rate it a three.
I:12654;1432;If your at all interested in Johnny Cash and like movies, you'll be pleased with this movie.
I:12654;1433;In other words, when you consider this film on its own merits, as a biop and entertainment, you've got to love it.
I:12654;1434;One also is immensely entertained by the driving sound track, the great musical numbers, the early touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis, and the fiesty and energetic performance of Witherspoon as a charismatic June Carter.
I:12654;1435;Phoenix and Witherspoon are terrific together.
I:12654;1436;Their chemistry is palpable and infectious.
I:12654;1437;And although, like all commercial films, some of the facts no doubt have been bent to add drama to the story, I loved the whole thing.
I:12654;1438;I also wonder where all his talent came from and how he got that voice and style.
I:12654;1439;But one thing's for sure, he was a unique artist and his story, as portrayed in this movie, is well worth seeing, hearing, and loving
I:12654;1440;If you like Johnny Cash and June Carter, this is a must see.
I:12654;1441;Just a great story about the life of a legend .
I:12654;1442;the real treat of WALK THE LINE is watching Phoenix and Witherspoon amaze with Oscar.
I:12654;1443;"Back home at the computer, I downloaded a couple more Cash songs, including his ""Jackson"" duet with Carter."
I:12654;1444;I knew then that WALK THE LINE was going to be an exceptional film.
I:12654;1445;Walk The Line is definitly my favorite movie of the year.
I:12654;1446;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutly amazing as Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1447;I hope it gets a whole lot of Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress.
I:12654;1448;I'd love to see this again in theaters.
I:12654;1449;I promise, you will be taken back by the outstanding acting and the awesome music of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1450;I thought that Juaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job as did Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;1451;all it is a great movie.
I:12654;1452;Johnny was an amazing person.
I:12654;1453;He knew exactly what he wanted and went after it.
I:12654;1454;Whether it was June or his music, he got it.
I:12654;1455;I love this man, he is and always will be missed.
I:12654;1456;The film is well done.
I:12654;1457;"The music was well done while the director enjoyed ""Rock and Roll ruby"" I did not have the same feel."
I:12654;1458;i am please overall with the film as I do think they got the feel of the lives like all biopics nothing is the absolute truth but they did a excellent job overall.
I:12654;1459;I was impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own singing, and did it well, in this story of Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1460;What I liked best about the film was the family drama .
I:12654;1461;I can return it after a trip there in about two weeks.
I:12654;1462;when you're with a charismatic personality like Johnny Cash who strives to overcome his own self.
I:12654;1463;What a sophisticated performance with many shades of color and tone.
I:12654;1464;Phoenix does a good job and especially when he's seen as a performer.
I:12654;1465;The prison scene is awesome and probalby worth the price itself to see that concert.
I:12654;1466;You can go home again and this movie proves it helps to have your own cheerleader and soul partner.
I:12654;1467;Good songs on disc 2.
I:12654;1468;Being A Johnny Cash fan, I loved this movie.
I:12654;1469;While both are fine actors it really takes a special talent and can be really risky portraying country music legends such as Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1470;"Then, I heard that ""Walk the line"" got good reviews from a number of critics."
I:12654;1471;And, my friends who saw it also spoke very highly of it.
I:12654;1472;After seeing it yesterday, I consider it the best movie of the year and worthy of oscar nominations.
I:12654;1473;"There are alot of similarities in this film with ""Ray"", but the main difference is that the complexity of his relationship with June is shown more here as a saving grace than Ray's wife was."
I:12654;1474;The director allows this focus to give insight to how songs were written by both Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1475;It's interesting after hearing Cash and Carter's songs for so long to finally see the circumstances surrounding their lives which inspired them.
I:12654;1476;phoenix and Witherspoon both give the performance of their careers.
I:12654;1477;Both their voices are amazingly accurate to the originals.
I:12654;1478;With Phoenix managing to hit all the right notes with a suprisingly almost perfect timbre, while Witherspoon sings well and even with a Carter.
I:12654;1479;The chemistry these two posess between eachother makes it easy for the audience to believe Johnny's love for June as well as June's reluctance to marry Johnny for so many years.
I:12654;1480;Both deserve a nomination for best actor and actress, since they both nail their respective parts.
I:12654;1481;Johnny's vulnerability and wild side are portrayed with ease by Phoenix.
I:12654;1482;Kudos to the rest of the cast but Witherspoon and Phoenix really make the film as well as the writers and director James Mangold.
I:12654;1483;Walk the line is touching, powerful, and highly recommended!
I:12654;1484;it was interesting to learn about Johnny Cash's life and music.
I:12654;1485;"about this time last year I saw ""Ray"", and the similarities between the two movies are numerous."
I:12654;1486;Both eventually get cleaned up with help from their woman.
I:12654;1487;Its always a pleasure to see history on film.
I:12654;1488;This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen.
I:12654;1489;The acting was amazing and touching.
I:12654;1490;The singing was astonishingly good.
I:12654;1491;Reese was amazing, but Joaquin should and MUST win an Oscar for Best Actor!!!!
I:12654;1492;This movie was a great reflection of Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;1493;The arguments between him and his father who never seemed to think that anything Johnny ever did in his life was worth anything.
I:12654;1494;"then, Enter the fiery June Carter, who becomes johnny's singing partner, they record and perform some of the greatest hits in Country music history such as ""The Ring of Fire"" written by June Carter about falling in Love With Johnny and ""Jackson"" which they performed together after Johnny's Marriage Proposal to June on stage, She later helps Johnny through his drug addiction."
I:12654;1495;this was an amazing movie but the story Line moved to quick it didn't elaborate on any single part in his life.
I:12654;1496;They both did an awesome job!
I:12654;1497;am going to see it again this Friday.
I:12654;1498;"You can
I:12654;1499;and this one is a really good one!thanks a lot for sending
I:12654;1500;Would recommend it without hesitation.
I:12654;1501;He did an amazing job capturing the personae and the sound of the late Mr. Cash.
I:12654;1502;This is a riveting movie which chronicles the life of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1503;The movie jumps ahead to Cash's life in the military and his attempts to be a door.
I:12654;1504;From the earliest days his passion is music and eventually he makes a success of himself by singing songs which he has written.
I:12654;1505;He has a longstanding admiration for June Carter, which grows into love, but she resists being connected to a man who is addicted to pills and other women.
I:12654;1506;"Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon shine in the starring roles and the chemistry between them is evident, especially when performing Johnny Cash songs such as ""Ring of Fire""."
I:12654;1507;This movie is highly recommended viewing.
I:12654;1508;This movie is so good.
I:12654;1509;The roles of Johnny Cash, by Joaquin Phoenix, and June Carter were so sincere and sound track is great
I:12654;1510;Its not a biopic of his life but a well.
I:12654;1511;impressive musical performances by both Joaquin and Reese.
I:12654;1512;Should be seen as a classic.
I:12654;1513;MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1514;Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes.
I:12654;1515;He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it.
I:12654;1516;While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch.
I:12654;1517;It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed.
I:12654;1518;The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting.
I:12654;1519;Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity.
I:12654;1520;The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.
I:12654;1521;aCTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good?
I:12654;1522;bOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well.
I:12654;1523;In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.
I:12654;1524;Both movies are great portrayals of two famous individuals .
I:12654;1525;each person helped to define contemporary music.
I:12654;1526;Mr. Phoenix's performance was flawless.
I:12654;1527;Walk the Line will stay in my memory (along with other great movies) for years to come.
I:12654;1528;That to me is the hallmark of a good movie.
I:12654;1529;Walk the Line is a fantastic movie and I am sure that we will see many more great performances from Joaquin Phoenix.
I:12654;1530;The film is amazing, I absolutely love it, but as for the copy of the film that I received .
I:12654;1531;The discs were fine however and played well.
I:12654;1532;I really enjoyed this movie, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have proven that they have excellent talent and can capture their audience.
I:12654;1533;The acting is great, the two actors really did a great job at singing and performing Cash/Carter's classic songs.
I:12654;1534;"What I loved is that they didn't try and make Cash/Carter seem perfect and their ""love story"" effortless and easy."
I:12654;1535;Still the movie really is about June and John, loving eachother and being best friends and finally overcoming everything.
I:12654;1536;You should see this movie, Phoenix doesn't impersonate Cash, he embodies him and Witherspoon shows us she can really, truly act.
I:12654;1537;Super movie, great actors and real to life story line, if you are a Cash/Carter fan this is a must see.
I:12654;1538;Also, I have a picture of John and I together and I must say with some make up and a hair style change I could resemble the man in black enough to be believable.
I:12654;1539;aNYWAY, the movie was great and the extra documenteries was worth the extra bucks and I cry too Marshal EVERYTIME I think of how much John and June meant to me too.
I:12654;1540;The acting story, drama, music, performances, and romance in Walk the Line.
I:12654;1541;The life of Johnny Cash was incredible.
I:12654;1542;He experienced fame, addiction, love, heartbreak, and everything in.
I:12654;1543;Though this film, the amazing acting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and the awesome music, we can see a bit of what this legendary man did.
I:12654;1544;It's a must see for fans of Cash, fans of music in general, or fans of pure entertainment.
I:12654;1545;You have to see this incredible movie.
I:12654;1546;Great acting, great music, and great movie.
I:12654;1547;As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.
I:12654;1548;Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self.
I:12654;1549;"the second story is that of June Carter, the ""other"" woman in Johnny Cash's life."
I:12654;1550;the third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1551;Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.
I:12654;1552;overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.
I:12654;1553;I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.
I:12654;1554;She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.
I:12654;1555;i highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.
I:12654;1556;Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).
I:12654;1557;Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix have an undeniable chemistry!
I:12654;1558;Plus, Joaquin's smoldering intensity as the legendary, yet conflicted, Johnny Cash makes this a must watch!
I:12654;1559;Walk the Line tells a biographical account of Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) life up to the mid.
I:12654;1560;Instead, the film efficiently displays the maturation of his character.
I:12654;1561;In the process, the audience gets a poignant glimpse into the roots and soul of his music.
I:12654;1562;In one long flashback, the film provides a uniquely inspiring and genuinely moving picture of his agonizing life and constant search for something better.
I:12654;1563;Johnny Cash had several defining moments that helped form his identity, which had the possibility to strengthen, or destroy him.
I:12654;1564;Walk the Line offers an opportunity for the audience to see how he responded on these moments.
I:12654;1565;It also displays the importance that other people have on an individual's existence, as Johnny would not have succeeded, or overcome his predicaments without the love and care of others.
I:12654;1566;johnny Cash's life was everything, but easy, to which his songs are a testament.
I:12654;1567;The upbeat beauty had a wondrous voice and a great sense of humor that brought about laughter, which must have been something Johnny dearly must have lacked during his upbringing.
I:12654;1568;She did not judge him, but shared her willingness to appreciate him and his music.
I:12654;1569;June made him feel alive, worthy, and free of judgment.
I:12654;1570;The black outfit serves a fitting symbolical value to Johnny, as a reminder of his past transgressions.
I:12654;1571;It provides something that people can relate to, but also find that they are not alone.
I:12654;1572;It convincingly echoed within each listener .
I:12654;1573;there are several aspects of Walk the Line that make it a brilliant film.
I:12654;1574;First of all, James Mangold is the perfect director for the film, as his profound understanding of human psychology only seems to improve, which also heavily influenced his previous films Girl, Interrupted (1999) and Identity (2003).
I:12654;1575;Several of the actors provide solid performances, especially Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix in the leads.
I:12654;1576;One must naturally also include the music, which is superb throughout the film.
I:12654;1577;Ultimately, these and other aspects of the cinematic process deliver remarkable cinematic experiences that will not fade in memory.
I:12654;1578;Walk The Line is a powerful portrayal to the human spirit, love, and the struggle of the crazy dream.
I:12654;1579;The movie in a sense is a great bio.
I:12654;1580;But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie.
I:12654;1581;the love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet.
I:12654;1582;deserved Oscar for her performance.
I:12654;1583;she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash.
I:12654;1584;a smart, intelligent, family orriented women.
I:12654;1585;but in this movie he actually acts the part too.
I:12654;1586;and deserved an Oscar for his performance.
I:12654;1587;The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend.
I:12654;1588;He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.
I:12654;1589;what is even more amazing is the music.
I:12654;1590;both actors sing their songs and REALLY well.
I:12654;1591;the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense.
I:12654;1592;"the movie is definately one of the movies that is ""must see"" the movie is heartwarming, heart."
I:12654;1593;breaking,and amazingly humorous at times.
I:12654;1594;"he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his ""June Carter love walk."""
I:12654;1595;Both actors give great performances and enduringly sweet.
I:12654;1596;This is definately a movie I'll watch more than once and one to have in your collection!!!
I:12654;1597;Walk The Line os about music legend Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1598;They continue to tour together.
I:12654;1599;This is way better than Ray starring Jamie Foxx.
I:12654;1600;Walk the Line is one of those films whose success depends entirely on the performances of the actors.
I:12654;1601;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are brought in to portray two icons in the world of music whose personal lives are just as fascinating as their work on stage.
I:12654;1602;"driven ""Cinderella Man"" earlier that year."
I:12654;1603;the music of the late Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is timeless, and so is his story.
I:12654;1604;He comes from a working.
I:12654;1605;His ambition was music, and he pursued it despite objections from his family and his wife.
I:12654;1606;He succeeds and becomes a nationwide phenomenon, touring with the likes of Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis when they first started out.
I:12654;1607;The movie covers the highs and the unbelievable lows.
I:12654;1608;Phoenix shows Cash as a talented but troubled man, while Witherspoon delivers a duel performance, one as a sassy June Carter when she's on stage and a compassionate one everywhere else.
I:12654;1609;They work together stunningly, and the rest of the cast is great as well.
I:12654;1610;regardless, the pacing of the film and the development of the characters is excellent.
I:12654;1611;"Even if you've never heard of Johnny Cash before he released his cover of Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"" a few years back, it's really captivating."
I:12654;1612;Even the performances of some of his greatest hits can appeal to anyone, from the indie rock aficionado to the death metalhead.
I:12654;1613;Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing, with incredibly impressive results.
I:12654;1614;It's a rather unique and alluring one, spanning many years and tons peaks and valleys.
I:12654;1615;It shows both the positive and destructive aspects of love, and you watch the effect of the relationship on Cash and Carter.
I:12654;1616;Walk The Line is a great movie.
I:12654;1617;The story is full of bliss and tragedy and really makes you appreciate the work of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1618;It may be a little too serious for some people, but it's still a splendid film that anyone can enjoy.
I:12654;1619;Now, this was a very very good movie and Reese and Jaoquin did an amazing job at the acting but they did not focus enough on the music and stuff but rather the romance.
I:12654;1620;i loved the movie though
I:12654;1621;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give impressive performances in this story of Johnny Cash and his long.
I:12654;1622;"i really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot
I:12654;1623;destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature.
I:12654;1624;This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.
I:12654;1625;They have great romantic chemistry on.
I:12654;1626;The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.
I:12654;1627;"I heartily recommend ""Walk the Line
I:12654;1628;coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.
I:12654;1629;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:12654;1630;The movie begins with Cash as a young boy and shows the hardship he endured during the Great Depression and the struggle he had with his Dad.
I:12654;1631;He goes into the Air Force, returns, marries, meets Sam Phillips (the record producer of Elvis Presley and other great musicians) and the rest is history.
I:12654;1632;I watched it twice and if they had an award for the best picture to come along in the last decade this movie for me would be the one and I would give it 10 stars.
I:12654;1633;Johnny Cash has always been a favorite of mine.
I:12654;1634;and what a wonderfully entertaining film this is!
I:12654;1635;The acting performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are Oscar worthy and perhaps the best work either has ever done.
I:12654;1636;Witherspoon becomes June Carter, down to her lovely voice and vivacious and energetic spirit.
I:12654;1637;the songs are absolutely wonderful.
I:12654;1638;While they cannot compare to the originals by Johnny and June, they hold their own quite nicely.
I:12654;1639;(If interested in heaing a really neat album of duets by Johnny and June, I recommend this one:Carryin' On With Johnny Cash and June CarterNothing but praise for this heart.
I:12654;1640;His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage.
I:12654;1641;Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family.
I:12654;1642;divorced mother of two young girls.
I:12654;1643;Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter.
I:12654;1644;More than lovers, the two are best friends.
I:12654;1645;His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.
I:12654;1646;witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well.
I:12654;1647;Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.
I:12654;1648;Reese Witherspoon was wonderful per usual and she captured the quirky personality of June Carter.
I:12654;1649;Great Movie I enjoyed it a lot.
I:12654;1650;"Walk The Line (2005) is the best music biopic since ""Ray"" (2004)!"
I:12654;1651;Joaquin Phoenix gives his Oscar nominated, career.
I:12654;1652;Reese Witherspoon is just as equally impressive in her Oscar.
I:12654;1653;winning performance as June Carter.
I:12654;1654;They also did their vocals to the songs they performed in the movie and on the soundtrack itself.
I:12654;1655;This is one of the year's best!
I:12654;1656;crafted and impressively told story about one of the greatest music legends of any generation and the love story between him and June Carter, the woman that gave on him.
I:12654;1657;James Mangold's directing is brilliant and one of his best films to date!
I:12654;1658;The screenplay by Mangold and Gill Dennis (which is based on Johnny Cash's books, The Man In Black and Cash: An Autobiography, which Cash co. wrote with Patrick Carr) is brilliant!
I:12654;1659;"The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who also did the cinematography to Mangold's ""Identity"" (2003) is excellent!"
I:12654;1660;The film editing (Oscar nominated) by Michael McCusker is great!
I:12654;1661;"The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting to ""Red Eye"" (2005) and Mangold's ""Identity"" (2003), Shirley Fulton Crumley, and Sarah Katzman (who also did the casting to ""Red Eye"" (2005) and Mangold's ""Identity"" (2003) is great!"
I:12654;1662;"The production design by David J. Bomba (who did the production design to ""Secondhand Lions"" (2003) is brilliant!"
I:12654;1663;"The art direction by John R. Jensen (who did the art direction to ""Secondhand Lions"" (2003) and Rob Simons (who did the art direction for ""Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" (2000) is brilliant!"
I:12654;1664;"The set decoration by Carla Curry (who also did the set direction to ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004) is brilliant!"
I:12654;1665;"The costume design (Oscar nominated) by Arianne Phillips (who also did the costume design to Mangold's ""Identity"" (2003) is brilliant!"
I:12654;1666;Also nominated for Best Sound.
I:12654;1667;my mom got me to be a fan.
I:12654;1668;Now my little girl is a fan and we both liked the movie.
I:12654;1669;But it was a good movie.
I:12654;1670;I really enjoyed Walk the Line.
I:12654;1671;Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job of portraying Johnny's highs and lows, and Reese Witherspoon absolutely becomes June Carter Cash.
I:12654;1672;I think this movie will become a classic in years to come and is a must.
I:12654;1673;see for the Cash fan.
I:12654;1674;It's a wonderful movie and a beautiful love story.
I:12654;1675;"Reese Wetherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix acting and vocals are outstanding
I:12654;1676;I highly recommend this movie, you'll love it.
I:12654;1677;as I write this review I'm listening to Walk the Line soundtrack, Cocaine Blues, great song.
I:12654;1678;Okay first of all, I think Joquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in this time.
I:12654;1679;I mean, I thought he was good in Gladiator and the Village, in this he should have got an Oscar.
I:12654;1680;Singing all of the songs and acting awesomely at the same time!
I:12654;1681;That deserves a ZOUNDS!Reese Witherspoon is very good too.
I:12654;1682;She doesn't sing as well as Joquin, but she still gives a great performance.
I:12654;1683;overall watch this movie, it gave me a much better appreciation for Mr. Cash and his life.
I:12654;1684;It was a great story, with wonderful acting.
I:12654;1685;step back and get to know one of country music's finest in this film.
I:12654;1686;I recommend this movie to people of all ages who enjoy biographical films, country music .
I:12654;1687;They both did a fantastic job portraying Johnny and June (they each respectively learned and performed the songs as well).
I:12654;1688;not a perfect love story but an honest and faithful one.
I:12654;1689;Underrated outside of Reese Witherspoons performance.
I:12654;1690;She was great but the movie aside is probably one of the best music bios of all time.
I:12654;1691;with this performance you can see what kind of man he was even if you never knew him.
I:12654;1692;He makes you believe that he's Johnny!
I:12654;1693;He also did all of the singing and guitar on his own.
I:12654;1694;"This is the best big budget, big screen biopic I've seen since ""Kinsey"", another film that tried to define its lead character through the poor relationship he had with his father."
I:12654;1695;What most distinguishes this biopic is the wonderful singing of the two leads, who do their own voicing for their parts.
I:12654;1696;Phoenix is remarkable as Cash and Witherspoon somewhat less so as Carter Cash.
I:12654;1697;For me, the best part of this picture is the singing.
I:12654;1698;"In a time where Hollywood is basically enamored with making ""remake"" movies, it is good to see Hollywood do something original for a change."
I:12654;1699;"Walk the Line is a movie that has its screenplay based on Johnny Cash's autobiography (and is also named for one of his hit songs, ""I Walk the Line"")."
I:12654;1700;This is a movie that will hold your interest from start to finish and will entertain you throughout.
I:12654;1701;"Much of the reason for why this movie ""grabs you"" is because of the incredibly strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
I:12654;1702;"while ""Walk the Line"" is a movie that covers the autobiography of Johnny Cash, much of the film focuses around his relationship with June Carter ."
I:12654;1703;After they have their first child Roseanne, we see how Cash formed a band and got his first record audition.
I:12654;1704;Following the release of their first record, Cash finds success and soon begins to hit the road touring with some of Rock and Roll's early legends.
I:12654;1705;During this time touring, Cash meets Carter and soon begins a longtime friendship and attraction to her.
I:12654;1706;The drug addiction will soon impact all aspects of Cash's life .
I:12654;1707;his marriage to Vivian, his relationship with Carter, and even his career.
I:12654;1708;In particular, we see Cash touring with Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley.
I:12654;1709;This is something I never knew about.
I:12654;1710;The performance of Jerry Lee Lewis by actor Waylon Payne was excellent.
I:12654;1711;making for some very entertaining scenes.
I:12654;1712;there aren't many negatives about the movie, but there are two things that I feel are worth mentioning.
I:12654;1713;It is clear that they both were perfect fits for this role.
I:12654;1714;Another point worth noting is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing throughout the movie.
I:12654;1715;Not only did Phoenix master the character of Johnny Cash, but he would also do an outstanding job at doing Cash's vocals.
I:12654;1716;Witherspoon deserves a lot of credit too .
I:12654;1717;she did a great job with the vocals as well.
I:12654;1718;and this was very important because the dynamics between Carter and Cash are the core of this movie.
I:12654;1719;because this is simply an outstanding story to follow.
I:12654;1720;This movie is highly recommended.
I:12654;1721;I love the messages behind this movie and the movie in general.
I:12654;1722;He absolutely should have won the Academy Award for best actor.
I:12654;1723;Reese Witherspoon was also great in it as the beautiful and devoted June Carter Cash.
I:12654;1724;I don't even know what to say exactly, except, I loved it.
I:12654;1725;I enjoy Johnny Cash's music.
I:12654;1726;I also enjoy Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon's acting abilities and felt they both gave great performances in this Johnny Cash Biopic, but felt the screenplay and narrow focus of Mr. Cash's life made the film unbearable.
I:12654;1727;pic that this is the love story of Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) and June (Reese Witherspoon).
I:12654;1728;I was close on that score, because the film includes an important grace note and fade out that says it all.
I:12654;1729;"what I liked about ""Walk the Line"" was that even knowing the key threads of the story, all of which are cinematic commonplaces, the screenplay by writer Gill Dennis and director James Mangold delivers memorable scenes."
I:12654;1730;Walk the Line saves the best for last.
I:12654;1731;Now, most of us remember the lady as June Carter Cash, so we know that she is going to say yes.
I:12654;1732;What is important is that it clearly will take something special for her to consent, and this film comes up with a moment worthy of their relationship and out anticipation.
I:12654;1733;phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing and what is key is not that they imitate Johnny and June but that they capture their hearts, which is a good thing in a romance, even when it also happens to be a bio.
I:12654;1734;During the final credits we finally hear the real Johnny and June singing as they take their curtain call.
I:12654;1735;"something that people will remember YOU by when your gone"" and the creative flow poured out of that man and guitar in Folsom Prison Blues."
I:12654;1736;Well worth the watch, sit back and enjoy .
I:12654;1737;Thanks So much Much appreciated.
I:12654;1738;And I have no doubt that they are very pleased with the outcome.
I:12654;1739;Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well.
I:12654;1740;it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
I:12654;1741;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.
I:12654;1742;Walk the Line is a movie that all will enjoy.
I:12654;1743;Cash fan or not this movie moves you and makes you enjoy the music and share in his life for a few hours.
I:12654;1744;i have been a Cash fan all of my life and this movie does his life story justice.
I:12654;1745;It was well acted, making you believe the addiction and certainly the love that John and June Carter Cash shared.
I:12654;1746;i would recommend this movie to all young and old.
I:12654;1747;After all, I really do love country music.
I:12654;1748;And Johnny Cash is one of my favorites.
I:12654;1749;And Reese Witherspoon, cast has his lady.
I:12654;1750;love June Carter did a good acting job, but I never really could relate to her.
I:12654;1751;A musician with a humble background who made good in the music industry, has a deep relationship with someone other than his wife, and who turns to alcohol or drugs because he can't escape blaming himself because of the death of a sibling.
I:12654;1752;"The film ""Ray"" was all about that and was a better film."
I:12654;1753;i liked the music of course.
I:12654;1754;Could see that a lot of prep work went into making Walk the Line, also a lot of good chemistry goin' on.
I:12654;1755;but, because the music in this film WAS Cash's, I enjoyed it, even though I did not enjoy Joaquin's or Reese's renditions of the songs.
I:12654;1756;well, I'd like to say I understand why Reese won the Oscar for her performace, but honestly, I don't.
I:12654;1757;"she was cute (but cute is her THING)
I:12654;1758;The best thing about it is the ending.
I:12654;1759;"Loretta Lynn was before my time as well, but I love ""Coal Miner's Daughter."""
I:12654;1760;This was a gift for a friend that kept borrowing mine.
I:12654;1761;If you are a Cash fan you will enjoy it.
I:12654;1762;If you just like a good story that happens to be true, you should probably enjoy it too.
I:12654;1763;It was a moving story and so well acted.
I:12654;1764;joaquin and Reese had amazing chemistry in every scene, but the best was watching them on stage together.
I:12654;1765;I thought they did such a good job singing rather than lip syncing.
I:12654;1766;Walk The Line is a great movie that I highly recommend.
I:12654;1767;It's so interesting and you can't help but tap your feet to the music.
I:12654;1768;It's so well acted and a great love story.
I:12654;1769;I was very happy with my purchace and the amount of time it took to recieve it.
I:12654;1770;The price was very good too.
I:12654;1771;If you are a Johnny Cash fan this is a MUST.
I:12654;1772;It'll keep you glued to your seat.
I:12654;1773;Not only did I learn more about Johnny Cash, but was entertained by the music
I:12654;1774;If you like Johnny Cash music, you'll love this movie!
I:12654;1775;"Instead I have become a very interested ""fan"" of Johnny Cash, and Mr. Phoenix and Ms Witherspoon."
I:12654;1776;If you enjoy music and appreciate the talent musicians have, you will love and appreciate this movie.
I:12654;1777;Johnny story is a great story of survival.
I:12654;1778;He has great character and inspiring intentions.
I:12654;1779;Joaquin Phoenix did a great job!
I:12654;1780;Reese, also a great job!
I:12654;1781;Hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!!
I:12654;1782;Everything about this movie is good, especially the acting.
I:12654;1783;The lead actors sing with their own voices in a very convincing fashion.
I:12654;1784;Reese Witherspoon brings June Carter to the silver screen opposite Pheonix's Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1785;It's a relationship fraught with Cash's addictions, marriage, inner demons, family feuding and Carter's own turmoil, career highs and lows, and years of refusing to acknowledge her own feelings for Cash.
I:12654;1786;"There are no worries about this movie
I:12654;1787;johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.
I:12654;1788;Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.
I:12654;1789;Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.
I:12654;1790;Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi.
I:12654;1791;Walk the Line is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.
I:12654;1792;Walk the Line is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.
I:12654;1793;Not only are the acting performances amazing in the movie, but the singing performances are equally brilliant!
I:12654;1794;Good movie and acting very entertaining to watch.
I:12654;1795;This movie holds up entirely because of the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;1796;The best of part of those performances is the singing.
I:12654;1797;Most of us always knew Mr. Phoenix was a fine young actor and he doesn't disappoint in the least.
I:12654;1798;She is a complete surprise, especially her singing, and she contributes as much as Phoenix to the film.
I:12654;1799;But, again, the performances are so wonderful, they more than compensate for the underwhelming script.
I:12654;1800;This is a great movie.
I:12654;1801;The acting is really axcellent, with J Phoenix and R Witherspoon turning in spectacular performances as Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1802;The actual singing is excellent and the music, under the direction of T Bone Burnett, is really great, very close to the original sound.
I:12654;1803;A must see for music fanatics everywhere.
I:12654;1804;My husband and I are Johnny fans, and we eagerly awaited this movie.
I:12654;1805;Reese, in my opinion, was the standout performance.
I:12654;1806;She did a wonderful job portraying June, in both happy and down times.
I:12654;1807;hearted, likeable aspects of Johnny's personality.
I:12654;1808;From that perspective, the sets and wardrobe were wonderful.
I:12654;1809;i've seen Brokeback, Crash, and Walk the Line.
I:12654;1810;It is the best of the three, in my opinion.
I:12654;1811;What I am is a Reese Witherspoon fan.
I:12654;1812;Now I am Joaquin Phoenix fan as well after seeing this great movie.
I:12654;1813;The acting is phenomenal and I can't say enough about the singing.
I:12654;1814;i enjoyed the movie although grew weary of all the scenes of Johnny as a drug addict.
I:12654;1815;Perhaps a sequel with a lot of music.
I:12654;1816;Walk the Line is one of the best movies of all time.
I:12654;1817;It chronicles the amazing story of the legendary Johnny Cash played by Joaquin Phoenix and his strength and savior June Carter played by Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;1818;Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver powerhouse performances.
I:12654;1819;What makes the movie even better is that Phoenix and Witherspoon both do their own vocals which really surprised me.
I:12654;1820;They both are talented singers and really did Johnny and June justice.
I:12654;1821;Great acting, great music: What more could you want out of a movie?
I:12654;1822;Both stars are great Joquin Pheonix and Reece Witherspoon are fantastic in the parts they portray as Johhny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;1823;this was a great movie.
I:12654;1824;i liked all the music they playeda movie all family would enjoy
I:12654;1825;"This is one great movie whether you like ""country"" music or not."
I:12654;1826;To know this was based on a true story is truly incredible.
I:12654;1827;Both Reese and Joaquin merge into their characters so well that you forget they aren't the actual people.
I:12654;1828;It just keeps getting better.
I:12654;1829;It is one of our favorites.
I:12654;1830;This is such a great film.
I:12654;1831;Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Jonny Cash or June Carter, but Joquin Phoneix and Reese Witherspoon did a terrific job portraying them.
I:12654;1832;This movie shows how important it is to have a friend like June.
I:12654;1833;She helped him become a better person, and he never made the same mistakes again.
I:12654;1834;I also enjoyed the music in this film because all of those songs were actually John and June's.
I:12654;1835;Both Joaquin and Reese were spectacular.
I:12654;1836;This is American culture at its best.
I:12654;1837;I believe he was a very good entertainer and an excellent performer with a great voice.
I:12654;1838;Joaquin Phoenix did and excellent job in this film, in his portrayal of the Man in Black.
I:12654;1839;This movie has excellent performance of Phoenix and of Witherspoon, who portrays his life.
I:12654;1840;Excellent performances of both actors.
I:12654;1841;A very good, entertaining, poignant film.
I:12654;1842;I recommend it for anyone who was a fan of Mr. Cash and likes country music.
I:12654;1843;It focused more on his exploits and early life.
I:12654;1844;OK he had his vices, he pulled himself together,created great music and here's how.
I:12654;1845;After viewing the entire film, viewing it again with the voice.
I:12654;1846;This version is so complete, so in depth, it made me want to write to Mr Mangold and his wife Kathy Konrad to thank them for their labor of love.
I:12654;1847;well, of course, I did.
I:12654;1848;The move arrived before the scheduled time and my friend was really happy with it.
I:12654;1849;This is one of the most fantastic films you have ever see, I guarantee that.
I:12654;1850;it is a true story of success, fame, drugs, heartbreak and unhappiness .
I:12654;1851;It is the story of the great Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;1852;it is very well done, and Phoenix and Witherspoon have good voices.
I:12654;1853;I recommend it to all ages, though I don't think anyone under ten should be seeing it, as there is a lot of drugs in it.
I:12654;1854;stay away fromthis one .
I:12654;1855;At first I considered, Walk The Line, one of the best movies I've ever seen .
I:12654;1856;I soon realized the movie was good, with a simple story and then realized that Phoenix made that movie.
I:12654;1857;He has talent way more than any of the others.
I:12654;1858;Phoenix has more than just acting talent, he's THE real deal.
I:12654;1859;NOT SO with Walk The Line.
I:12654;1860;"Lawrence of Arabia is the classic example
I:12654;1861;eventually these biopic films became much more honest, incorporating both the positive and the negative aspects of individuals.
I:12654;1862;"This is fine
I:12654;1863;It's fascinating to see the darker side of important figures.
I:12654;1864;It makes them much more real, and yet makes their accomplishments all the more spectacular.
I:12654;1865;Ray was one of the best movies of the decade.
I:12654;1866;The story of Ray Charles put to the silver screen.
I:12654;1867;Audiences got a healthy dose of music, an incredible performance by Jamie Foxx, and a fair picture of the life of Ray Charles, including the low points and the high points.
I:12654;1868;It's a biography of a musical figure who had low points in his life.
I:12654;1869;"joaquin Phoenix does a good job portraying the enigmatic singer Johnny Cash
I:12654;1870;The movie looks good, each scene has good direction.
I:12654;1871;In fact, a major part of the story, the romance between June Carter and Johnny Cash, is absent.
I:12654;1872;"In an act of pure ""Christo."
I:12654;1873;"After watching ""Ray"" I had a better understanding, respect and empathy for Ray Charles."
I:12654;1874;The story of Johnny Cash's life is as tough as it is inspiring.
I:12654;1875;His friendship and eventual love for June Carter stabilized the internal chaos that fame and fortune brought him.
I:12654;1876;a wonderful movie about 2 of the greatest country/western stars ever.
I:12654;1877;joaquin phoenix and reese witherspoon were the ideal people to play these people on the screen and certainly did justice to them as icons of the music business.
I:12654;1878;This is an excellent movie about Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;1879;This is a great movie.
I:12654;1880;The story, the acting, and the music combine to make it memorable and enjoyable.
I:12654;1881;The strongest points aside from the story however, are the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon.
I:12654;1882;I enjoyed the story of Johnny's past including little details, like his family surviving a flood and of course the traumatic event of him losing his brother which changed his relationship with his father, which seemed somewhat frayed to begin with.
I:12654;1883;The set designers did a great job in really making you feel like you were back in that time period as well.
I:12654;1884;Overall a very enjoyable film that covers a lot of the roads that Cash walked.
I:12654;1885;We went to see the movie a few days ago and were very moved by the movie.
I:12654;1886;It was well put together, the acting was great and the singing was was very close to original.
I:12654;1887;The singing was very good and it was as if Johnny was singing again.
I:12654;1888;But the love and strength of God and of a wonderful woman helps to pull this man from his crying out.
I:12654;1889;He becomes a great man with incredible strength and a solid life based on his faith in God.
I:12654;1890;I must admit that I enjoyed this film, though.
I:12654;1891;The most impressive factor to me (as a recording engineer and producer) was Joaquin Phoenix's ability to emulate the vocal characteristics of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1892;Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie.
I:12654;1893;the life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.
I:12654;1894;Luckliy for Johnny Cash and all of his fans, this one did.
I:12654;1895;Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderful together.
I:12654;1896;Walk The Line is one of the best biopics I've ever seen.
I:12654;1897;We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.
I:12654;1898;Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian.
I:12654;1899;"The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military
I:12654;1900;but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.
I:12654;1901;After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.
I:12654;1902;will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him?
I:12654;1903;"i certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968
I:12654;1904;However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.
I:12654;1905;Great!Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there.
I:12654;1906;I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing!
I:12654;1907;Johnny Cash was a good human being and an exceptionally talented man who deserves to have his life portrayed in a biopic.
I:12654;1908;People who like biopics will also enjoy this film.
I:12654;1909;This is an all around great movie.
I:12654;1910;It's well directed, well shot, and well written.
I:12654;1911;It's brilliantly acted and very entertaining.
I:12654;1912;A good biography is hard to make.
I:12654;1913;"It could be said that ""Walk the line"" is a movie about the life of Johnny Cash, a very well."
I:12654;1914;"the opening sequence is wonderful, and will make you realize that you weren`t wrong in choosing to watch ""Walk the line""."
I:12654;1915;Notwithstanding that, you will also end up learning quite a few things about one of the most important American musicians of all time, and about a period in which many conventions were being broken by new artists.
I:12654;1916;the scenes where Johnny struggles with his addiction to drugs and with depression are quite difficult to watch, probably due to the fact that Joaquin Phoenix delivers a splendid performance.
I:12654;1917;Reese Witherspoon is also outstandingly good as June, the person that saves Johnny Cash from himself.
I:12654;1918;There are funny moments too, and also some wonderful scenes recreating Johnny's concerts that allow you to listen to the real deal.
I:12654;1919;Oh well, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one.
I:12654;1920;It is not perfect, but it is the kind of movie that you simply must see and enjoy.
I:12654;1921;With 'Ray' and 'Capote' we have been spoiled with great performances.
I:12654;1922;To me it's still them, though Witherspoon is funny and great as June Carter.
I:12654;1923;It's a good movie, a good story about two people who were alive.
I:12654;1924;"Apart from the fact he'd died, and someone on American Idol had sang ""Walk The Line"", which I absolutely loved the lyrics to."
I:12654;1925;"apart from ""Walk The Line""."
I:12654;1926;There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him and June finally got married and got together.
I:12654;1927;But the film holds well, as do Reese and Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.
I:12654;1928;i was slightly dissapointed that it wasent nominated for best picture but at least Witherspoon got a well deserved oscar, otherwise i would be PO'd.
I:12654;1929;the film, like last years Ray, tells the story of another music legend.
I:12654;1930;we see his upbringings from childhood, to the time he enrolled in the army, marrys his girlfriend, and then that day he walks into that studio and earns himself a spot on the label.
I:12654;1931;i thought the performences were exceptional from Pheonix playing the rugged Cash and Witherspoon, wow has she grown.
I:12654;1932;her performence definently deserved that oscar and i'm proud of her.
I:12654;1933;so, see the movie thats on my top 10 list and you'll be blown away.
I:12654;1934;"wonderful performances by phoenix and wither spoon
I:12654;1935;He did an incredible job bringing Johnny Cash to life.
I:12654;1936;This movie is such a wonderful tribute to Cash's life and music, and it's also a beautiful love story.
I:12654;1937;(I completely teared up during the final concert scene at the end of the film.
I:12654;1938;In addition to Phoenix and Witherspoon, the supporting cast boasts excellent performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife, Vivian, and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father.
I:12654;1939;Everything about this movie is perfect.
I:12654;1940;"i was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time!A lot of great movies were released last year, but ""Walk the Line"" was definitely one of the better ones."
I:12654;1941;Hopefully Phoenix and Witherspoon will walk away with the top honors, though.
I:12654;1942;Even though WALK THE LINE is labeled a biopic about June and Johnny Cash, it's also a solid love story that will stand for years.
I:12654;1943;Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.
I:12654;1944;Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.
I:12654;1945;the movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.
I:12654;1946;the scenes and settings feel right and look right.
I:12654;1947;The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.
I:12654;1948;even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.
I:12654;1949;The chemistry between the actors is great.
I:12654;1950;This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.
I:12654;1951;And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.
I:12654;1952;Either way you're going to enjoy the film.
I:12654;1953;This turned out to be a very good movie about Johnny Cash.
I:12654;1954;cash's addiction to drugs is well displayed in this movie.
I:12654;1955;the heroic efforts ofJune Carter and her family helped him defeat this addiction andget back on his feet.
I:12654;1956;he was able to have his own television show.
I:12654;1957;he became one of the most beloved figures in the world.
I:12654;1958;It was one of the best movies to come out last year.
I:12654;1959;The acting was superb, the music added more depth to a movie that was full of it already and the cinematography was great.
I:12654;1960;Joaquin Cash hit it on the nail with his performance of Johnny Cash (I did think it was him during some occasions) and Reese as June.
I:12654;1961;she earned that Oscar for a reason.
I:12654;1962;IMO, it was more enjoyable than last year's Ray.
I:12654;1963;"director James Mangold (the quirky ""Heavy"" and the effective ""The Yards"") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight."
I:12654;1964;witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.
I:12654;1965;"The best biopics require strong, incandescent performances at their core and ""WTL""has that in spades with Phoenix and Witherspoon's revolutionary recreations/interpretations of Cash and Carter."
I:12654;1966;Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter.
I:12654;1967;Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance.
I:12654;1968;It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances.
I:12654;1969;One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself.
I:12654;1970;A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances.
I:12654;1971;WALK THE LINE is a well done, convincing portrait of one of country music's greatest stars.
I:12654;1972;While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.
I:12654;1973;Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.
I:12654;1974;phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.
I:12654;1975;He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.
I:12654;1976;witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.
I:12654;1977;Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.
I:12654;1978;while James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.
I:12654;1979;A good biopic all around.
I:12654;1980;I saw this movie in theaters and I thought this was a very powerful and expressful movie.
I:12654;1981;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a beautiful job portraying Johnny and June.
I:12654;1982;I think they did a beautiful job and Johnny and June would be proud!
I:12654;1983;I Walk The Line was a refreshing change!The cast performances were excellent and Phoenix and Witherspoon were astounding!
I:12654;1984;This is a must see for Country music fans, regular music fans, and nostalgia fans.
I:12654;1985;It's the best performance that I ever witness by two individuals.
I:12654;1986;"This verison of ""Walk the Line"" is the best way to see this movie."
I:12654;1987;The added elements flesh out the characters, making ofr a better film overall.
I:12654;1988;As a child, we see two people that shaped his life: his brother and his father.
I:12654;1989;After getting a record deal, he finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Witherspoon).
I:12654;1990;both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give excellent performances, sounding and acting just like the stars that they are portraying.
I:12654;1991;"Phoenix is as good, if not better than Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in last year's ""Ray""."
I:12654;1992;The story is well told, and it is interesting to see the events that shaped Cash's life, and made him who he is.
I:12654;1993;"Whether you are a Johnny Cash fan or not, ""Walk the Line"" is a highly entertaining and well made movie that is worth seeing."
I:12654;1994;Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter.
I:12654;1995;Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance.
I:12654;1996;It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances.

I:12654;1998;A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances.
I:12654;1999;"James Mangold's ""Walk the Line"" is a decent, slightly plodding show."
I:12654;2000;biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars.
I:12654;2001;carter songbook in fine style.
I:12654;2002;Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman.
I:12654;2003;Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes.
I:12654;2004;"Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see ""Walk the Line."""
I:12654;2005;Walk The Line is an exceptional movie (much better than Ray, a movie that always demands to be compared with WTL).
I:12654;2006;Joaquin Phoenix completely nails Cash, and vividly and effortlessly depicts Cash's struggles and triumphs.
I:12654;2007;He creates an empathy for Cash that few movies can rival.
I:12654;2008;"Reese Witherspoon is spectacular as June Carter
I:12654;2009;Overall, this is one of the most enthralling non.
I:12654;2010;fictional movies I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it.
I:12654;2011;I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.
I:12654;2012;Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain.
I:12654;2013;Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity.
I:12654;2014;Writer and director James Mangold, along with co. writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life .
I:12654;2015;and one of the most exciting times in American music.
I:12654;2016;into an entertaining and insightful film.
I:12654;2017;Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative.
I:12654;2018;He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality.
I:12654;2019;Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.
I:12654;2020;i think Her Performance is what got her awarded the Oscar.
I:12654;2021;the film was well put together.
I:12654;2022;good to see the film acknowledging many of the Highs&Lows of Johnny Cash's Musica career.
I:12654;2023;Such a nice tribute to The Man in Black.
I:12654;2024;It certainly changed my opinion of the man in a good way.
I:12654;2025;"By itself, ""Walk the Line"" is a 5."
I:12654;2026;a blockbuster flick with an indie.
I:12654;2027;"film groove

I:12654;2029;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give top.
I:12654;2030;witherspoon's honest performance of the complex and spirited June Carter Cash was nothing short of magnificent.
I:12654;2031;To be sure, the admiration of the friends and family commenting within the featurettes was genuine and heartening.
I:12654;2032;"did Johnny and June never get their pictures taken or their performances recorded?As a movie, ""Walk the Line"" is a gem."
I:12654;2033;It is poignant that this film's exec.
I:12654;2034;producer is Johnny and June Cash's son, John Carter Cash.
I:12654;2035;creation of his life, you will love both the movie and the sound track.
I:12654;2036;Having watched his career and life since the time of Sun records, the early days, I was thrilled with the acting which took you through the years, the songs that were done so well and the events that brought Johnny Cash from the lowest to the highest point in his life.
I:12654;2037;His life is a tribute to the strength and ability of the human spirit and that a complete turnaround can be done with love and faith.
I:12654;2038;I will treasure this movie and sound track for bringing to life significant things that made Johnny Cash what he was.
I:12654;2039;"From the opening moment when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) stares reminiscently at a saw blade, ""Walk the Line"" goes for the heart as it paints a vivid portrait of the Man in Black and woman, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) who saved his life."
I:12654;2040;The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T. bone Burnett, is magnetic.
I:12654;2041;Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.
I:12654;2042;And Reese Witherspoon is dynamite as the sassy and strong.
I:12654;2043;"A biopic that resonates, ""Walk The Line"" sticks with genuine emotion."
I:12654;2044;The movie summarizes the starting of Johnny and June Cash's relationship.
I:12654;2045;It also shows events that happened in Johnny's life like the incident with his brother.
I:12654;2046;Overall, it's a really good movie.
I:12654;2047;Walk the Line is a very good film, lifted even higher by its two great lead performances.
I:12654;2048;They should both get Oscar nominations along with the film itself.
I:12654;2049;I liked Ray as well, but Walk the Line is a better film in my opinion.
I:12654;2050;If you want to hear great music and get some insight into one of the most influential musical artist ever, don't walk, run to see this one now.
I:12654;2051;the other cast members were equally compelling.
I:12654;2052;The lovely actress playing Cash's first wife had a striking resemblance to Rosanne Cash, and Mother Mabel Carter's roll could not have been portrayed better.
I:12654;2053;In all, the casting for this movie was some of the best ever.
I:12654;2054;this is a great movie and, I believe, a fairly accurate portrayal of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2055;Whether you are a fan of Cash's music or not, this movie is certainly 2 hours well spent.
I:12654;2056;With both Phoenix and Witherspoon nominated for best actor/actress (she won) how can you lose?
I:12654;2057;Sorry I waited so long to watch it.
I:12654;2058;This is just a beautiful example of what TRUE LOVE really is.
I:12654;2059;Walk the Line is one of my top best for 2005.
I:12654;2060;Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix gives killer performances.
I:12654;2061;This work so well together and there singing was surprisingly really good.
I:12654;2062;I love Reese Witherspoon's singing voice!
I:12654;2063;It sounds sweet and cute.
I:12654;2064;"This surely an entertaining film compared to ""Ray""."
I:12654;2065;"I could sit through and be entertained while ""Ray"" I wanted to turn off."
I:12654;2066;"From his early days in Arkansas to traveling the highways as a singing sensation to falling in love with fellow entertainer June Carter, the movie ""Walk the Line"" told the triumphs and tragedies of the early life of the legendary Johnny Cash."
I:12654;2067;Whether you're a diehard fan of Cash and his music or a movie enthusiast, this movie will keep you intrigued and entertained.
I:12654;2068;several years later, an older Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) leaves the family's home, enters the Air Force and finds himself stationed in Germany.
I:12654;2069;fated attempt to balance the grueling schedule, an increasingly volatile family life and his secret love for June, Johnny turns to amphetamines and soon finds himself hooked.
I:12654;2070;The rest, as they say, is music history.
I:12654;2071;Even though we know the story's ending, it's interesting to see part of the journey that gets us there.
I:12654;2072;"A good biographical picture gets moviegoers interested enough to make them want to know more about the person being portrayed on the screen even after the film stops rolling and I think ""Walk the Line"" does that."
I:12654;2073;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were wonderful as Johnny Cash and June Carter and were convincing in their performances, even doing their own singing.
I:12654;2074;It also would have been interesting to see a few more scenes between Johnny and his dad, but the scene at the end did bring a degree of closure to their situation.
I:12654;2075;Walk the Line is definitely one of the best biopic films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.
I:12654;2076;I liked this movie, but it just didn't seem to do justice to the subject.
I:12654;2077;"I much prefer ""Coal Miners Daughter"" as a Biography."
I:12654;2078;fi fan than anything else but I do take in some other films when they seem to get solid reviews and I enjoy the subject matter.
I:12654;2079;Well, I do like Johnny Cash's music and felt that this movie was worth my time.
I:12654;2080;One minute, Johnny and his band were really struggling and the next minute they had songs in the top 20.
I:12654;2081;He magically woke up one morning and was a star.
I:12654;2082;Reese Witherspoon as June Carter was decent as well.
I:12654;2083;"Like ""Ray"" before ""Walk The Line"" is a fine piece of work, made so great by the superb singing and acting of Phoenix/Witherspoon."
I:12654;2084;i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a great story with even better acting.
I:12654;2085;Great film, and respectful of Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2086;Well written, each character sing by their own voice and it goes smoothly in the movie.
I:12654;2087;It is a truly beautiful love story and the performances by Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are inspiring and wonderful.
I:12654;2088;It is a special tribute to a dynamic pair of true soulmates.
I:12654;2089;if you also haven't listened to the also late great June Carter than this is also your chance to get to know the lady behind the myth played exquisitely by Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;2090;but i am here to tell you that both do amazing jobs and deserve the recognition they so very well deserve.
I:12654;2091;i was dumbfounded actually how good phoenix really was.
I:12654;2092;James Mangold directs the movie beautifully with great camera movements,beautiful scenery of the south,and great performances by his cast.
I:12654;2093;but overall,this is a movie that i'll probably see again in the theatre,something i haven't done since i was a kid.
I:12654;2094;the great thing is is that you don't have to be a fan of the cashs' to be able to appreciate this work of art.
I:12654;2095;the soundtrack is worth seeing in the theatre as there are some other suprises as well like acted out live performances by jerry lee lewis and elvis.
I:12654;2096;you'll just have to see it for yourself.
I:12654;2097;A touching story of two very influential people who shared their lives with us.
I:12654;2098;Singing and acting was spot on, made for a great movie and good insight into the early career of Cash
I:12654;2099;I thought the sound of the music was fantastic.
I:12654;2100;I am a new fan of Johnny Cash but I love the stories he told in his songs.
I:12654;2101;Sometimes people meet the love of their life and ride the wave of adventure together for a lifetime.
I:12654;2102;I love this story of Johnny Cash and June Carter, how they met, what they accomplished together, and how they were meant to be one.
I:12654;2103;This movie is done well and very accurate (it should be considering the Cashs' son was involved in the making)!
I:12654;2104;A great watch for any fan or someone who might be interested in learning more about Johnny and June and potentially becoming a fan!
I:12654;2105;eyed intensity and a voice as dark as the night, the legendary ?
I:12654;2106;revolutionized music?and forged his legacy as a genuine American icon.
I:12654;2107;Golden Globe winners Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon star (and sing) as Johnny Cash and June Carter in this inspiring true story of one man?s unwavering devotion to his sound, his message and the greatest love of his life.
I:12654;2108;We loved theinterreaction between the characters and the entire story of JohnnyCash acted out by Joaquin Phoenix.
I:12654;2109;He is an excellent actor and playedthe part very well.
I:12654;2110;When I read Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Johnny I somehow knew he would do a great job.
I:12654;2111;Walk The Line is a financial success only because it was a smaller budget, large release, movie at around $31 million production cost ($60 million after marketing and distribution), and pulled in $153 million in gross revenue, at the time of this post, due to some unexpected great acting.
I:12654;2112;It's nice to see the studio get it right for a change.
I:12654;2113;25 years ago I got the rare opportunity to join two people and have dinner with Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2114;One of these people was Johnny's personal friend, and I was a tag.
I:12654;2115;"There was something about Johnny's physical size, voice, straight forward mannerism and his ""against the grain"" attitude that affected my life that night and even to this day."
I:12654;2116;As much as I love the fighting scenes in all the Star Wars Prequels, the movies do have a few flaws.
I:12654;2117;It is also why the first three Star Wars movies so completely eclipse the prequels.
I:12654;2118;in this movie the road/touring/stage is Home.
I:12654;2119;It is a powerful Home.
I:12654;2120;there are a lot of good things about this movie: pacing, acting, great cast.
I:12654;2121;but this movie is something special because it nails its sense of Home.
I:12654;2122;Watching this movie might be a good start.
I:12654;2123;I have seen this movie before, and I love it.
I:12654;2124;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon beautifully captured the love story of Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2125;about a talented guy and the woman he loved.
I:12654;2126;Loved the music, excellent acting, and they both sing very well.
I:12654;2127;enjoyed every minute of it and watched the extended cut to the very end and didn't want it to end.
I:12654;2128;A great story, told very well, without any offensive language or violence.
I:12654;2129;This movie was a pleasant surprise.
I:12654;2130;Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deserved an Oscar for their performances.
I:12654;2131;If you're a Johnny Cash fan the music was great.
I:12654;2132;Joaquin Phoenix does a breath taking job at portraying Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2133;The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning.
I:12654;2134;Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other.
I:12654;2135;It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing.
I:12654;2136;the story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done.
I:12654;2137;One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world.
I:12654;2138;This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line.10/10 Classic.
I:12654;2139;Being a huge Johnny Cash fan I was looking forward to this movie and I was not disappointed.
I:12654;2140;I thought Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were fantastic as The Man in Black and June.
I:12654;2141;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie both from the historical information concerning Johnny Cash's youth and from the very wonderful singing, especially the duets, of the actors playing Johnny and June Cash.
I:12654;2142;If anything, the performances actually exceeded the abilities of the real Johnny and June.
I:12654;2143;We both enjoyed the music and the story.
I:12654;2144;My grandfather has met Johnny Cash in person, and I've been a huge fan.
I:12654;2145;If you are a Johnny Cash or June Carter fan you shold see this movie.
I:12654;2146;Joaquin Phoenix and Resse Witherspoon are great actors to portray Johnny and June.
I:12654;2147;Before seeing Walk the Line, I new very little about Johhny Cash.
I:12654;2148;the movie touches briefly on Johnny Cash's childhood, enough to paint the picture of a few events and relationships that would shape his life forever.
I:12654;2149;The film next follows Johnny on tour, at the beginning of his career, as he played shows with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and a young Miss June Carter.
I:12654;2150;They travel from city to city delighting audiences, playing shows, having a good time, and for some of them, maybe even falling in love.
I:12654;2151;June Carter, despite being the object of Johhny's affection for many years prior to their marriage, played a very valuable role in his life.
I:12654;2152;She saved him from his own demons and inspired him to continue his greatness.
I:12654;2153;It is truly an impressive thing they did in lending their singing voices and not just their faces to Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2154;Joaquin Phoenix's voice was incredible.
I:12654;2155;I thought he did an amazing job sounding like Mr. Cash.
I:12654;2156;from an acting standpoint I feel that there were two breakthrough performances in Walk the Line.
I:12654;2157;I hope that is about to change.
I:12654;2158;"Your secret is no longer safe, Reese
I:12654;2159;Her performance, which earned her an Academy Award, was full of strength and passion.
I:12654;2160;She did humor, drama, and love and she did each one well.
I:12654;2161;Well, I do not know him personally and have never actually met the man, but I refer to the roles he has played.
I:12654;2162;Joaquin Phoenix played the lead, nay, he owned the lead in Walk the Line.
I:12654;2163;walk the Line is a movie with two great performances about two great performers.
I:12654;2164;for another movie with great vocal performances by the actors see The Commitments.
I:12654;2165;I loved this movie because I remember Johnny Cash and I admired how he was able to kick a drug addict and rebuild his life and have a successful marriage.
I:12654;2166;both of the stars were exceptional in this film.
I:12654;2167;This was a wonderful movie, coming from a teenager's standpoint.
I:12654;2168;I never really and don't usually listen to Johnny Cash, but Joaquin's performance was so heartfelt and tortured, it was amazing.
I:12654;2169;I can definitely see why he was up for an oscar.
I:12654;2170;Reese was so funny and adorable.
I:12654;2171;And I loved seeing Elvis and Jerry Lee too, everyone was great!
I:12654;2172;This was a really good way to see Cash's journey.
I:12654;2173;The acting is great but what struck me was the musical excellence and all around stage performance.
I:12654;2174;The duet 'Time's A Wastin' is pure magic!
I:12654;2175;I've been listening to Johnny Cash's music my whole life and I honestly thought the music and vocals was Cash's original versions rather than the actual singing voices of the leads.
I:12654;2176;I can understand why she got the Oscar for Best Actress.
I:12654;2177;In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.
I:12654;2178;The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.
I:12654;2179;"In ""behind the scene"" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot."
I:12654;2180;What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry and effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2181;The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.
I:12654;2182;It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbinson.
I:12654;2183;Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.
I:12654;2184;The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.
I:12654;2185;A matured and heartfelt movie that's made with a lot of guts and love.
I:12654;2186;Mesmering to watch and highly recommended.
I:12654;2187;The price is fantastic, and the seller is willing to give full details on the item.
I:12654;2188;From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory.
I:12654;2189;Walk the line introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man.
I:12654;2190;kind, and it is well earned!It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music.
I:12654;2191;classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus.
I:12654;2192;and I must say that especially she managed to impress me (and perhaps for the first time, the girl can act!)
I:12654;2193;"I was impressed by Val Kilmer in ""The Doors"", I am just as impressed by J. phoenix from his appearence in ""Walk the line""."
I:12654;2194;There's a lot of powerhouse acting talent in the Johnny Cash biopic WALK THE LINE.
I:12654;2195;star Johnny is urged to start doing drugs because Elvis does.
I:12654;2196;both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Withersoon deliver the performances of their careers as Johnny and touring partner/soulmate/eventual partner/mate June Carter.
I:12654;2197;The feel of the period is wonderful and Robert Patrick is in top form as Johnny's humble but wise Arkansas father.
I:12654;2198;Director James Mangold does fine and the two top stars sing the numbers themselves and do superbly.
I:12654;2199;Johnny and June get married and we're told they lived happily ever after for their last 35 years.
I:12654;2200;WOW WHAT A FANTASTIC,AMAZING,BRILLIANT,SPEACHLESS film.
I:12654;2201;So they both involve adultery and special love interest.
I:12654;2202;for one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.
I:12654;2203;But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.
I:12654;2204;Ahhh, the state of modern music.
I:12654;2205;Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.
I:12654;2206;It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.
I:12654;2207;I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.
I:12654;2208;It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.
I:12654;2209;I think this film is pretty darned great.
I:12654;2210;I had heard good things about this film, but it really moved me and made me fall in love with the characters.
I:12654;2211;joaquin Phoenix is the perfect John, with his black attire and deep, soulful singing voice.
I:12654;2212;speaking of Reese, her Oscar as well as other awards were well deserved.
I:12654;2213;You can't help but fall in love with the sassy little June Carter, and the relationship between the two breaks your heart and makes you cheer all at the same time.
I:12654;2214;the music, the acting, and the story are all worth a look (and listen).
I:12654;2215;Solid movie for a Saturday afternoon that will really move you.
I:12654;2216;Everything about their lives and their music was authentic.
I:12654;2217;How fitting is it, then, that this biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon rings utterly true and heartfelt.
I:12654;2218;with all the passion, pain, and redemption one should expect from a re.
I:12654;2219;telling of this quintessential love story.
I:12654;2220;"director James Mangold paces the story perfectly, from Johnny's early days on a cotton farm to his early struggles in music and marriage
I:12654;2221;Ultimately, it's a story of redemption and restoration, but it has a freshness and vitality that owes everything to the splendid performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon in the lead roles.
I:12654;2222;Both of them absolutely nail their characters but never once lapse into caracature.
I:12654;2223;the legend of Johnny Cash is so towering and epic that it surely must have seemed a daunting task to bring it to the screen.
I:12654;2224;Phoenix captures both the strength and the pathos of this brilliant, complex.yet also heartfelt, direct, and even simple.
I:12654;2225;"and Witherspoon is a delight in her role as June Carter
I:12654;2226;She completely lights up the screen every second she is on it.
I:12654;2227;"She displays a fantastic range of emotions throughout the film
I:12654;2228;smitten with June, thanks to Witherspoon's luminous portrayal.
I:12654;2229;the sets and costumes are spot.
I:12654;2230;"It's such an engaging and engrossing ""vibe"" that this viewer was a bit stunned and disappointed when the theater lights came on and the film ended."
I:12654;2231;creation of Johnny and June's landmark Folsom Prison concert.
I:12654;2232;Crackling with energy and intensity, this one vignette powerfully portrays what Johnny and June were all about.
I:12654;2233;one wants to stand, stomp, and shout during the rousing performance.
I:12654;2234;all of the supporting cast is stellar.
I:12654;2235;Shooter Jennings, portraying his dad, is particularly strong.
I:12654;2236;I was personally moved deeply throughout by Johnny and June's triumphs over adversity and their great love for one another.
I:12654;2237;And that goes double for Witherspoon's tour.
I:12654;2238;viewers will leave with a smile on their lips, a song in their hearts, and a little bit of boom.
I:12654;2239;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Withersoon have exquisite chemistry and they really do justice to the legacy of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2240;Joaquin's characterization in particular is so realistic that its almost scary.
I:12654;2241;Watch it in DTS and turn it up!!
I:12654;2242;The story line and acting captured the emotion and feeling of the time and lives of these people.
I:12654;2243;The music was entertaining and might actually have made a fan out of me.
I:12654;2244;It is well worth the time and money to see this movie at least once.
I:12654;2245;I'm looking forward to the Oscar results.
I:12654;2246;Both Reese and Joaquine do an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2247;He was fantastic and beyond believable in this role.
I:12654;2248;movie overall was captivating from start to finish.
I:12654;2249;I think reviewing the history of two great people was really a great thing to do.
I:12654;2250;Knowing the true story, was interesting.
I:12654;2251;There's no question that he was an impressive young talent in his early years.
I:12654;2252;That Sun Record group was a great collection of musicians.
I:12654;2253;"I've considered ""Folsom Prison Blues"" a bold classic of Country Western music."
I:12654;2254;There's no question, however, that Johnny Cash had a life that was worthy of a major motion picture.
I:12654;2255;"Fortunately, ""Walk the Line"" was worthy of its' subject."
I:12654;2256;It does an excellent job of providing illuminating vignettes of his young adult years and his start in music.
I:12654;2257;His first marriage is examined with the sort of balance that comes from having his children involved in the production of the movie.
I:12654;2258;We know just enough about her to know he's right (and she's right as well).
I:12654;2259;The emerging relationship with June Carter is the real focus of the movie and that, too, was well developed.
I:12654;2260;It took a lot of patience, however, with the self.
I:12654;2261;The concert at Folsom Prison served as the defining point in the movie.
I:12654;2262;"Kudos to director James Mangold for giving us a glimpse of homelife banality as a way of saying ""All is well""."
I:12654;2263;Walk the Line tells the story of Johnny Cash,one of the greatest musical legends of the 20th century.
I:12654;2264;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have wonderful on.
I:12654;2265;screen chemistry and provide some of the most accurate voice and physical portrayals of the real music legends found on film to date.
I:12654;2266;the cast,acting and cinematography are top.
I:12654;2267;all in all,Walk the line succeeds in telling one of the greatest stories in music history.
I:12654;2268;joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have given us a glimpse of these great musicians bound by love and music that will not be soon forgotten.
I:12654;2269;if you are a musician or enjoy music in general than you should see this film.
I:12654;2270;I throughly enjoyed this biopic.
I:12654;2271;joaquin and Reese were beyond awesome in this, I love their singing!
I:12654;2272;I'm not a huge fan of Johnny Cash, but this movie really riveted me and made me look up more of his songs.
I:12654;2273;and it certainly solidified my belief that Joaquin Phoenix is one of THE best actor's of this age.
I:12654;2274;to anyone that reads this so they can understand musicians a bit more because musicians are very unique beings .
I:12654;2275;very sensitive as we transform our feelings into MUSIC.
I:12654;2276;If you are strong enough you can still be successful no matter what and discard them.
I:12654;2277;johnny Cash was a door to door salesman and thanks to Sam Phillips form SUN RECORDS got a record deal and then he moved up the ladder and became thanks to his talent over time .
I:12654;2278;this is a wonderful film by one of the greatest musicians of our time and it made me a Johnny Cash fan.
I:12654;2279;They possibly did the best performance of their respective careers in this movie.
I:12654;2280;Phoenix and Witherspoon really make this film.
I:12654;2281;They are amazingly good performers who between the two of them have built up a remarkable resume of performances and top it off with this film.
I:12654;2282;Both of them deserved to win Academy Awards for the job they did and the fact that Phoenix didn't is only because P. s. Hoffman also did such a remarkable job.
I:12654;2283;anyway, I was never a big Cash fan (had nothing against him, just didn't know much about him or his music) but this film really made you appreciate him and June Carter as people and as performers.
I:12654;2284;once in a while a great story melds with career.
I:12654;2285;defining performances and you have the stuff of greatness.
I:12654;2286;such is the case with Walk the Line, the story of Johnny Cash's early years and pursuit of June Carter.
I:12654;2287;as good a love story as there is on film, and all the more powerful because it is true.
I:12654;2288;equally powerful is reese witherspoon's portrayal of the strong, spirited and complex June Carter.
I:12654;2289;Walk The Line captures Johnny Cash's life from 1944.1968.
I:12654;2290;"The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, ""Man In Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography"", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about."
I:12654;2291;The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.
I:12654;2292;There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.
I:12654;2293;"the film is quite exceptional in capturing the ""Man in Black."""
I:12654;2294;Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country.
I:12654;2295;One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.
I:12654;2296;walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.
I:12654;2297;I thoroughly enjoyed this film and imagine it will eventually be regarded as a classic, if it isn't already.
I:12654;2298;"June was an important figure in the true story, but she played an auxiliary role
I:12654;2299;I was very impressed with the movie itself, let alone the fantastic extras in the Collector's Edition.
I:12654;2300;Still what resonates is the film itself and the sheer talent of its cast, the story it tells and the attention to every last detail.
I:12654;2301;however, I will say that this is the finest acting job Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix both have done to date.
I:12654;2302;The Two Disc set is cool and gives you extended performances of CASH and June Carter.
I:12654;2303;"i had been waiting for this movie with a great deal of excitement
I:12654;2304;I love movies where movie stars sing.
I:12654;2305;Both leads did an incredible job.
I:12654;2306;"and so I didn't have any checkboxes to tick or things I really wanted to see done right in ""Walk The Line""."
I:12654;2307;plus treasure that manages to be insightful, entertaining and .
I:12654;2308;Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together.
I:12654;2309;with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip.
I:12654;2310;not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.
I:12654;2311;"James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W
I:12654;2312;Musical numbers are kept nicely and wisely understated and the whole look and feel of the movie is very pared.
I:12654;2313;all in all, this is an excellent character study: two amazing performances from the leads mean that a simplistic plot of boy.
I:12654;2314;girl is showcased in a beautiful, satisfying and very real way.
I:12654;2315;While it was not my favorite music biopic, it certainly was interesting.
I:12654;2316;Reese also does a commendable job in singing all of her own songs as well.
I:12654;2317;That's okay though, since Cash lived enough in his early years to fill 3 lifetimes.
I:12654;2318;Nothing to make one want to see it twice!
I:12654;2319;Everything from story line, costumes, music, set design, acting it was Hollywood first class all the way.
I:12654;2320;The talents of Reese and Joaquin own singing voice on this film was that of a Broadway show.
I:12654;2321;"I can be extremely ciritical but this film i give ""Thumbs Up."""
I:12654;2322;Great job done by everyone.
I:12654;2323;western fan but I'm here to tell you that this is one for the ages, best my wife and I have ever seen.
I:12654;2324;i loved reading the 1.
I:12654;2325;Man is a legend would recommend as it was really cool.
I:12654;2326;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:12654;2327;Absolutely amazing in every aspect.
I:12654;2328;worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, is absolutely exceptional in this movie.
I:12654;2329;"This beats Jamie Foxx's ""Ray"" by a lot."
I:12654;2330;It makes you want to jump onto the screen, and throw Johnny's pill bottles away.
I:12654;2331;Reese Witherspoon (though she is considerably prettier than June Carter was) does a wonderful job at her part.
I:12654;2332;One of the most impressive things these two people did, was actually sing in the movie!
I:12654;2333;Most actors who have to play rock stars have the music dubbed in, and just hope they can lip it well enough to look convincing.
I:12654;2334;The singing sounded great, and I, being a music/movie obsessive and a Texas Pre.
I:12654;2335;"The two men playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley were hilarious, and the men playing Johnny Cash's ""Two Tennessee Men"" were great."
I:12654;2336;this movie beats Narnia, King Kong, and any other movie I've seen this year, and almost my whole near.15 years of existence.
I:12654;2337;Awesome depiction of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's love and life together.
I:12654;2338;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both wonderful in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2339;The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done.
I:12654;2340;Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic.
I:12654;2341;overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best.
I:12654;2342;"genre, so called because they were ""rockin' hillbillies"", and that faction also included Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and a few others."
I:12654;2343;Johnny was the most powerful songwriter of that group, with his Leadbelly.
I:12654;2344;But that's either touched upon lightly or just plain implied and it takes a Cash fan to spot it.
I:12654;2345;the lead performances are good.
I:12654;2346;I found their vocal performances to be well done.
I:12654;2347;"And when I watch ""non."
I:12654;2348;that aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.
I:12654;2349;First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.
I:12654;2350;i always thought Cash was a big man.
I:12654;2351;And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.
I:12654;2352;Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.
I:12654;2353;She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.
I:12654;2354;First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce.
I:12654;2355;and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.
I:12654;2356;and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.
I:12654;2357;This is a time before everyone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non.
I:12654;2358;ironic and painful and totally appropriate.
I:12654;2359;but overall, she's quite solid.
I:12654;2360;Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination.
I:12654;2361;The concert scenes are fabulously believable.
I:12654;2362;There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable.
I:12654;2363;we see it on stage.
I:12654;2364;When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.
I:12654;2365;I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.
I:12654;2366;i also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X. fILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.
I:12654;2367;It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.
I:12654;2368;agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.
I:12654;2369;Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.
I:12654;2370;especially with some great Cash music in the background.
I:12654;2371;But these quibbles aside, it's a very entertaining movie and I would give it about 4.25 stars.
I:12654;2372;You will learn so much about the actors themselves, Johnny Cash and the movie making industry itself.
I:12654;2373;Funny stuff but it hasn't stopped me from watching!
I:12654;2374;Unlike my father, he met and was saved by the love of his life.
I:12654;2375;well picture Bobby Burgess dancing with John Lennon.
I:12654;2376;As much as June Carter added color and years to the life of Johnny Cash, Ms. Witherspoon brightens (and in my opinion, saves) the telling of yet another drug.
I:12654;2377;i will always be deeply grateful to Ms. Carter for giving Johnny Cash a reason to live and perform.
I:12654;2378;without Ms. Witherspoon, Walk The Line would be a wonderful movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast.
I:12654;2379;With Ms. Witherspoon, its a great movie.
I:12654;2380;"It is a glorious story of a man who married well but whose wife did not ""compute"" music, and of the love that grew ""on the road"" between Johnny Cash and his eventual bride (who got him off drugs and helped him ""walk the line"")."
I:12654;2381;the underlying theme, of going from uncotrolled use of drugs to a straight existence within reality powered by love, is uplifting.
I:12654;2382;None Whatsoever overlooks that Johnny Cash made a lot of great records.
I:12654;2383;Phoenix and Witherspoon are outstanding and one of them should win the Oscar.
I:12654;2384;From humble beginnings and early rejection , an icon emerges.
I:12654;2385;this movie had the greatest ensemble acting the best story.
I:12654;2386;the best direction the best casting of any picture last year and is an all time classic bio pic.
I:12654;2387;the commentary by the director is also excellent.
I:12654;2388;the chemistry between the two principals is amazing as is their commitment to these roles.
I:12654;2389;witherspoon i think won an oscar for this so should have joaquin in an uncanny performance.
I:12654;2390;a masterpiece of movie making with the best shootout in movie history.
I:12654;2391;and the greatest sound effects during that shootout .
I:12654;2392;its a special movie that produces this kind of work.
I:12654;2393;how his voice actually dropped during production.
I:12654;2394;both leads took the stage and sang like real pros.
I:12654;2395;and the interplay between them is priceless .
I:12654;2396;full of pathos real drama much pain the stuff of a very rich life lived by these interesting basically humble unassuming people .
I:12654;2397;is riveting from beginning to end.
I:12654;2398;and the thrilling concert at folsum.
I:12654;2399;the actress who played cash`s first wife ws amazing too.
I:12654;2400;i cant recommend this movie enough.
I:12654;2401;which i think won the british version of the oscars for best picture last year and rightly so.
I:12654;2402;ive enjoyed all these great movies lately and recommned all of them.
I:12654;2403;So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.
I:12654;2404;born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.
I:12654;2405;I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.
I:12654;2406;the film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.
I:12654;2407;If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.
I:12654;2408;Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.
I:12654;2409;On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.
I:12654;2410;Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.
I:12654;2411;Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.
I:12654;2412;Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.
I:12654;2413;She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.
I:12654;2414;Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.
I:12654;2415;And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.
I:12654;2416;all in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.
I:12654;2417;Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.
I:12654;2418;And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.
I:12654;2419;Walk the Line is an excellent portrayal of the life of Johnny Cash, an American rock and country icon, and of his relationship with June Carter, whom he has been in love with since he was a boy.
I:12654;2420;"This film is very similar to the 2004 film ""Ray"", but has two excellent lead performances instead of one."
I:12654;2421;Excellent musical performances and a solid cast make for one great film, one of the best of 2005.
I:12654;2422;joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the Man in Black, fully channeling not only his performances on stage, but also his life offstage, his strange obsession with June Carter and his struggles with prescription pills.
I:12654;2423;Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter.
I:12654;2424;Cash and Witherspoon's onscreen chemistry is one of the key factors in the overall success of this film.
I:12654;2425;the film's music is great, with one memorable supporting performance with Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley, complete with the hip.
I:12654;2426;The cast is solid all around, and the dialogue and acting are very good along with onstage performances.
I:12654;2427;Walk the Line is one of the best films of 2005 boasting two of the best performances of 2005.
I:12654;2428;Onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon along with great musical performances make this film a real winner.
I:12654;2429;I did however enjoy the his music and the revelations of his personality and his life within the context of his biography.
I:12654;2430;Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job in playing,June Carter, his devoted and pricipled wife and lover.
I:12654;2431;All in all a very entertaining and informative story about an interesting and talented personality.
I:12654;2432;Johnny Cash is legend to those of us boomers.
I:12654;2433;Mystique of that gravely voice tied with drugs and prisons and broken love life here portrayed in vignette display of this fascinating life.
I:12654;2434;seems like the oft told story of a basic human's life filled with basics we all enjoy, family, religion, etc. which then goes bad under constant cooker of touring, alcohol, pressure, drugs, away from wife and family, etc. boy the ties here on dramatic, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc. they do an outstanding job with the music, Phoenix and Witherspoon.
I:12654;2435;"Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs (""Cash: the Autobiography"" and ""The Man in Black""), ""Walk the Line"" becomes, in many ways, the ""official"" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash ."
I:12654;2436;"Yet, ""Walk the Line, "" written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic cliches thanks to solid writing, toe."
I:12654;2437;tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar .
I:12654;2438;phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy.
I:12654;2439;Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character.
I:12654;2440;Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.
I:12654;2441;I am a Johnny Cash fan and I think Joaquin and Reese played very good parts.
I:12654;2442;It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio .
I:12654;2443;the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.
I:12654;2444;He courts the lovely June Carter.
I:12654;2445;earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.
I:12654;2446;(They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double.
I:12654;2447;This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen .
I:12654;2448;Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father .
I:12654;2449;in short, it's funny and sad .
I:12654;2450;I love the music and the honesty.
I:12654;2451;The extended cut version has some interesting new scenes.
I:12654;2452;I suspect I knew a dozen Johnny Cash songs prior to seeing this movie.
I:12654;2453;That probably makes it a successful movie!I did wish I knew how much was fantasy and fact.
I:12654;2454;This movie is the greatest of all time!
I:12654;2455;Phoenix and Reese are phenomenal in there role as Johnny Cash and June Carter
I:12654;2456;Joaquin Phoenix should also have won the Oscar for this moving.
I:12654;2457;His voice, both spoken and singing, was absolutely astoundingly similar to Johnny Cash's.
I:12654;2458;And his guitar playing was phenomenal.
I:12654;2459;I believe Johnny himself would have been impressed.
I:12654;2460;This is an excellent film with some insights into the inside of country music and its stars.
I:12654;2461;Other than that, all in all, it was a good movie with an absolutely wonderful soundtrack.
I:12654;2462;I did enjoy it a great deal.
I:12654;2463;"perhaps most the outstanding aspect of the film is the ability of Phoenix to interpret and mimic the mannerisms and attitude of Johnny and much like Jamie Foxx's efforts in the comparable ""Ray"" he should be bequeathed with the golden statue by the good people of the Academy."
I:12654;2464;I liked the story and the actors.
I:12654;2465;Joaquin Phoenix is terrific in his part as Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2466;Reese Witherspoon as June Carter is a cute sweetheart to say the least.
I:12654;2467;I am happy that Johnny and June tied the knot.
I:12654;2468;pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married.
I:12654;2469;"brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but ""Walk The Line,"" aims to be a love story, and succeeds."
I:12654;2470;Walk The Line has a backstory for all the pain .
I:12654;2471;Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man.
I:12654;2472;radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare.
I:12654;2473;June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner.
I:12654;2474;She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife.
I:12654;2475;clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year.
I:12654;2476;notch and really fabulous and for that aspect this movie is worth 5 stars.
I:12654;2477;Overall it's an inspiring film, especially for aspiring singer/songwriters, because this film gives them hope that their music may reach a broader audience some day too.
I:12654;2478;And the inspiration aspect alone is well worth watching this flick.
I:12654;2479;The music is great too and as mentioned Phoenix just plays his part so very well and Reese as June Carter does also an excellent job without overplaying the role.
I:12654;2480;the photography has also been executed very well especially regarding the set details for each particular era.
I:12654;2481;But overall it's an inspiring movie and well worth watching it.
I:12654;2482;Little did I know how fascinating Cash's tale would be.
I:12654;2483;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon turn in Oscar worthy performances as Cash and his wife and frequent collaborator June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2484;A fun part of the films is that Johnny and June were contemporaries of Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and we get to see them represented as well.
I:12654;2485;these kinds of movies are good for people of my generation because they bring home exactly how innovative and visionary the performers of the past were.
I:12654;2486;Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were cool, they were the very essence of cool.
I:12654;2487;The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.
I:12654;2488;Both feature heroes raised literally dirt.
I:12654;2489;And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced.
I:12654;2490;up Cash, and he nails it.
I:12654;2491;Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.
I:12654;2492;But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.
I:12654;2493;strong as a train and sharp as a razor.
I:12654;2494;That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job.
I:12654;2495;On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.
I:12654;2496;marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.
I:12654;2497;One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.
I:12654;2498;And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.
I:12654;2499;this is powerful stuff, if conventional.
I:12654;2500;you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.
I:12654;2501;I return to this film every couple of years and I'm taken back by the incredible performances every time.
I:12654;2502;Although it's taken some heat for it's accuracy in a few character depictions, I've found it to be one of the most entertaining bio pics ever made.
I:12654;2503;I have been a casual Johnny Cash fan since I was a kid.
I:12654;2504;My main musical interest is classic and progressive rock.
I:12654;2505;I also really like biographical movies such as The Aviator and A Beautiful mind and now I Walked the Line.
I:12654;2506;This is an outstanding movie, and like Johnny, it is very honest.
I:12654;2507;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutely amazing in their respective parts as Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2508;They sing all of the songs themselves, and did an outstanding job.
I:12654;2509;Yes, it would have been awesome to see actual video of the Folsom Prison taping, but still contains an amazing amount of history and information.
I:12654;2510;Walk the Line tells the story of Johnny Cash and also his beloved wife June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2511;The movie is awesome and wonderful performances by Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2512;I think that this movie should have won best picture at the awards,but it didn't.
I:12654;2513;I think that this movie is a must watched movie and if you love Johnny and June's music then you should check this one out it is worth it!!!!!!!!!!
I:12654;2514;Phoenix really does a great character study here, he nails Cash, I was even surprised at how much he resembled Cash, considering he really looks nothing like him, it was a tribute to the research he did to get his famous mannerisms down.
I:12654;2515;having said that, the movie belongs to the fabulous Witherspoon, she is fantastic in this film, and frankly she has never been more radiant.
I:12654;2516;The movie itself is well paced and you stay with it, at first I thought it ended a bit abruptly, but thinking back on it, the ending was true to the film.
I:12654;2517;Thank you for such a great offer and smooth transaction.
I:12654;2518;"Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man."
I:12654;2519;but they're right for once.
I:12654;2520;reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich d bumpkin.
I:12654;2521;the chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on.
I:12654;2522;I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film.
I:12654;2523;I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.
I:12654;2524;He has nailed the part of Johnny Cash and, quite feasibly, an Oscar.
I:12654;2525;After seeing Elvis through the back door of a local recording studio, Johnny gets the idea to form his own band and make a record.
I:12654;2526;"A stellar cast and a superb script make ""Walk the Line"" one to watch at Oscar time."
I:12654;2527;"An accurate movie about ""The Man In Black""."
I:12654;2528;Great sound track, great acting, great story!
I:12654;2529;A candid and realistic excursion into the highs and lows of a true country music legend.
I:12654;2530;The acting and character development is so genuine it could be a documentary.
I:12654;2531;It's a video that you'll watch multiple times, and is worth owning just for the music alone.
I:12654;2532;This is definitely a must see movie!
I:12654;2533;Two incredible actors light up the screen!
I:12654;2534;"while ""Line"" is the story of Johnny Cash, it is more than just that ."
I:12654;2535;in my opinion, these are the best parts of the film.
I:12654;2536;Cash's interaction with the lovely and honest June, and being part of the tour circuit.
I:12654;2537;of course, with all the adulation and success comes the downfalls .
I:12654;2538;with Vivian taking their children.
I:12654;2539;She has two young daughters to raise and she is in love with Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2540;She stays by his side and helps him kick his dependency.
I:12654;2541;particularly with such a public figure, beloved by so many.
I:12654;2542;But this film succeeds and succeeds so well mainly because of the performances.
I:12654;2543;I forgot I was watching Mr. Phoenix as Johnny Cash, he transformed himself INTO Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2544;reese Witherspoon is perfection as June Carter Cash .
I:12654;2545;her physical loveliness would be enough to make someone fall in love with her, but her strength and heart shine through.
I:12654;2546;phoenix and Witherspoon's singing together is phenomenal.
I:12654;2547;this film was an absolute delight and makes clearly evident why both Phoenix and Witherspoon were nominated for Best Acting honors.
I:12654;2548;You will end the film not only with Cash's songs in your head, but with the deep love he shared with June in your heart.
I:12654;2549;definitely one of the best films of 2005.
I:12654;2550;The actors performed their parts well.
I:12654;2551;The actors did a great job portraying June and Johnny.
I:12654;2552;Loved the music in this movie and went to see it expecting to really love the movie.
I:12654;2553;Good acting but the story was just another star on drugs and recovering.
I:12654;2554;joacquin Phoenix does a nice job but the real star of the film is Reese Witherspoon whose beauty and talented portrayal of June Carter steal the show.
I:12654;2555;Johnny Cash is one of America's most legendary musicians.
I:12654;2556;One of those rare artists that manage to transcend the genre they're moving in.
I:12654;2557;Although Cash is unmistakably a country artists he always managed to appeal to a much broader audience.
I:12654;2558;In the fifties he had much appeal to the R audience of Elvis and Roy Orbison.
I:12654;2559;In the nineties he came back courtesy of Rick Rubin.
I:12654;2560;He was then embraced by both the alternative audience and the gansta rappers.
I:12654;2561;in Walk The Line director James Mangold takes a pretty straight forward approach to telling the Cash story.
I:12654;2562;The registration of this concert would become his most enduring and biggest selling records.
I:12654;2563;Joaquin Phoenix makes a convincing Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2564;Reese Witherspoon makes a formidable partner.
I:12654;2565;Throughout the movie the interplay between them is thrilling to see.
I:12654;2566;The romantic story of Johnny Cash and June Carter seems cut for Hollywood and certainly rubs of on these fine actors.
I:12654;2567;Both Joaquin and Reese sing themselves in this movie, a daring choice that works out fine.
I:12654;2568;Witherspoon actually sings better than June.
I:12654;2569;Cash's fascination with scripture and self.
I:12654;2570;"Johnny Cash may be known for many things
I:12654;2571;"train Voice"" displays his life."
I:12654;2572;time joys and sorrows that propelled him up inot the music status of Icon.
I:12654;2573;out preformance, that either has yet to top (I think Joaquin was still in character during Lettermen), in this true tale of love, addiction and music.
I:12654;2574;This may not be a Film of the Ages, but it surely is a fine trubute to Mr. J. r. Cash.
I:12654;2575;This is quite simply a brilliant film, with superb performances by Phoenix and Wetherspoon.
I:12654;2576;I knew nothing about Johnny Cash before this film, but feel I've come away with some understanding of the man as well as a real appreciation of his music.
I:12654;2577;The music is great and makes for an excellent introduction to Johnny Cash's work.
I:12654;2578;This is also well worth a viewing even if you know nothing of Cash or aren't a big fan of country music, it can be watched as a human interest story in it's own right, but you will leave it captivated by the man.
I:12654;2579;Well, let me tell you, it is a fantastic Blu.
I:12654;2580;the picture was just fantastic and as good as any Blu.
I:12654;2581;The sound was also really great.
I:12654;2582;Plenty of clean LFE especially in the music scenes.
I:12654;2583;great movie (5 out of 5), (10 out of 10) or (4 stars of 4 stars).
I:12654;2584;Whichever method of rating you use, this is as close to a perfect biopic as you can get.
I:12654;2585;If you love this movie and can't wait to see it in the best available format.
I:12654;2586;i can highly recommend this Aussie Import version.
I:12654;2587;I thought this movie was perfectly cast.
I:12654;2588;Both Witherspoon and Phoenix brought superb acting (and surprisingly good singing) to the drama.
I:12654;2589;"Walk The Line is a rare kind of film
I:12654;2590;Their initial record is a hit, and they find themselves on the road with Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter(Reese Witherspoon), who descends from a famous singing family.
I:12654;2591;the film continues through Johnny's initial struggle with drugs and his attempts to win his father's approval, as well as his tumultous relationship with June.
I:12654;2592;The music is presented in an exciting way, thanks to Phoenix's ability to capture Cash's onstage charisma.
I:12654;2593;Phoenix and Witherspoon, both novice singers prior to the film, both do well.
I:12654;2594;Both actors deliver terrific performances.
I:12654;2595;This is a very entertainging ride.
I:12654;2596;june Carter story, is an exhilarating musical biography.
I:12654;2597;It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.
I:12654;2598;With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.
I:12654;2599;Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers.
I:12654;2600;The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar.
I:12654;2601;I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances.
I:12654;2602;this may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.
I:12654;2603;WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.
I:12654;2604;It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.
I:12654;2605;It is an absolute must.
I:12654;2606;com is selling it at half.
I:12654;2607;And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice.
I:12654;2608;But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular.
I:12654;2609;It is a great story from beginning to end.
I:12654;2610;It shows his rise to stardom and the toll it took on his family life, and how much June Carter really meant to him.
I:12654;2611;There are great cameos of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.
I:12654;2612;This is a great movie!
I:12654;2613;The music and acting is GREAT!
I:12654;2614;"The one standout film for the year was ""Walk the Line,"" the Johnny Cash bio."
I:12654;2615;Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Man in Black is startling, proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in hollywood.
I:12654;2616;Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter.
I:12654;2617;She plays here as both a spit.
I:12654;2618;fire and a compassionate friend who saves Cash from.
I:12654;2619;It's these two performances that give the film it's soul, and the fact that the two stars did all their own singing makes it a very impressive film.
I:12654;2620;The supporting cast, such as Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, and Dallas Roberts as Sam Phillips, are solid.
I:12654;2621;disc Collector's Edition for the film is a must.
I:12654;2622;The extras are excellent, including a featurette about Johnny's historic concert at Folsom Prison, where he emerged as the Man in Black.
I:12654;2623;Walk the Line is an exceptional film with fantastic acting, fine storytelling, and excellent music that will have your toes tapping before the end.
I:12654;2624;I highly recommend this film for fans of Cash, and for movies buffs as well.
I:12654;2625;"So all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed watching this film, and I think Joaquin and Reese did a great job ""impersonating"" Johnny and June."
I:12654;2626;I've never been a fan of Cash, but I liked listening to the songs here, and I wanted more singing.
I:12654;2627;The romance between Johnny and June, with all its warts and faults, was touching as well.
I:12654;2628;Walk the Line is the best musical bio.
I:12654;2629;Phoenix and Witherspoon were superb.
I:12654;2630;notch, edgy because they sang them imperfectly but well.
I:12654;2631;Reece got that June Carter Cash twang just about right.
I:12654;2632;Johnny Cash's music is pure Americana.
I:12654;2633;To understand the heartland, one must immerse and learn from the sounds, the stories and the message of Cash's great songs.
I:12654;2634;This film captured Cash's imperfect, sinful nature that always contrasted with his great love of Christ his Savior.
I:12654;2635;A great film that tells the tragic story of his destroyed marriage, love for an elusive June Carter, and his many addictions (drugs, alcohol, and chicks).
I:12654;2636;It also shows his strength in surviving it all and turning his life around.
I:12654;2637;The movie was very interesting to me because Cash was played so often by my father on Sunday mornings when I was growing up (we didn't go to church much).
I:12654;2638;Cash's voice was truly unique and the lead actor and actress both did an excellent job of relating the story and bringing back to life what it must've been like for these southern country stars in the 1950s.
I:12654;2639;The movie should hit home with viewers on many levels and get a fella to thinking about his own life.
I:12654;2640;After hearing about this movie I was excited to see it.
I:12654;2641;This is a good movie.
I:12654;2642;Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were brilliant.
I:12654;2643;The story and direction of the movie was great.
I:12654;2644;Turns out this is an exceptional movie, with superb acting, a realistic plot illustrating real life challenges, and a love story about undeniable attraction that eventually triumphs despite conservative societal opinion.
I:12654;2645;definitely worth watching and memorable.
I:12654;2646;The movie looked and sounded amazing.
I:12654;2647;The cut scenes were put back into the movie seemlessly and to great effect.
I:12654;2648;This movie is incredible, both Reese and Joaquin mold into their roles more and more as the movie goes on and by the second half you have to remind yourself that it really isn't Johnny and June.
I:12654;2649;From beginning to end you are treated to the heart of the characters and the musical performances outreached my wildest dreams.
I:12654;2650;The history of the era is demonstrated through the camaraderie of other up and rising musical greats of the time.
I:12654;2651;Their road trips together are classic and the portrayal of these personalities will make you laugh as you are treated to what seems like an endless streams of live concerts all across the United States.
I:12654;2652;However, the most captivating and believable theme is the friendship and romance of June and Johnny.
I:12654;2653;As a friend she stood by him through the most down and out period of his life, his best friend and this movie excellently portrays her dedication to him as a person and how that understandably translates into his absolute adoration of her.
I:12654;2654;Extremely well done, I am looking forward to seeing it again.
I:12654;2655;Joaquin Phoenix does as good a job as anyone could do portraying the Man in Black.
I:12654;2656;The music scenes are great, the standard self.
I:12654;2657;This was a great movie.
I:12654;2658;It really tells the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2659;The actors did a fantastic job!!!
I:12654;2660;First of all, the collector's edition is definitely worth the extra $10.
I:12654;2661;Also, most of the deleted scenes are very good, which in my opinion rarely happens.
I:12654;2662;"Personally, I very much liked ""Ray""
I:12654;2663;"It does have the same basic story line, but I feel the performances by Juaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon together were far superior than most of the performances in ""Ray""."
I:12654;2664;Also, there is a true love story behind this movie.
I:12654;2665;see, whether you like country music or not!
I:12654;2666;I was very surprised at how good this movie was.
I:12654;2667;"In my opinion Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of June Carter is spectacular and very deserving of the Oscar she won for it
I:12654;2668;Not to downplay the performance of Joaquin Phoenix because he was also very captivating and gave an incredible performance.
I:12654;2669;I also love the fact that they did all the songs themselves, they did a great job with the singing also.
I:12654;2670;"Overall, great great movie
I:12654;2671;but the happy ending is soooo boring that it almost spoiled the otherwise good impression.
I:12654;2672;Love the actress, she is a good comedian.
I:12654;2673;His love is music, and he becomes successful.
I:12654;2674;Gets drunk and high, etc.
I:12654;2675;One of those men who always wants what he can't have.
I:12654;2676;joaquin Phoenix does a pretty good job of looking drugged out and helpless most of the time, and Reese Witherspoon does a great job of acting classy, strong, yet vulnerable.
I:12654;2677;"I thought ""He's already so great, why would they undermine his life and let Hollywood ruin it with their stupid plotlines?"""
I:12654;2678;I truely hand it to both of them, they made this movie what it is.
I:12654;2679;Even if you don't really like Johnny Cash, you'll love this because it's not just a sappy love story, it's a story of strength and, like I mentioned earlier, dedication.
I:12654;2680;This is definately a movie worth watching.
I:12654;2681;I am a huge Johnny Cash fan, as well as a huge fan of bio.
I:12654;2682;Reese Witherspoon also does an excellent job, and it goes on down the line, I was also very impressed with the supporting cast.
I:12654;2683;I will be going to see it again while it's still in theatres!
I:12654;2684;Even if you're not a country music fan or a Johnny Cash fan, I truly believe that you would enjoy this movie!
I:12654;2685;It's just an all around great picture, I foresee Oscar nominations!
I:12654;2686;The cool part about this movie was that all of the actors and actresses did the singing themselves.
I:12654;2687;The movie is enertaining and a exciting movie to watch.
I:12654;2688;It's interesting seeing all of Johnny's struggles throughout the movie.
I:12654;2689;stomping power of the very first scene, music is the thread that binds these two restless hearts and what makes the movie even more remarkable is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing!
I:12654;2690;I'm a huge fan of Mr. johnny Cash's music.
I:12654;2691;it brought me joy to know that Reese Witherspoon, a southern belle would portray the lovely Ms. june Carter in Walk the Line.
I:12654;2692;She deserved to win the award she did.
I:12654;2693;true to fact as far as I know joaqin phoenix and reese witherspoon do a damn fine job!
I:12654;2694;the portrayal of his childhood scars is simplistic, but as one angle on a complex life, the film succeeds as a romantic biopic.
I:12654;2695;often genuinely thrilling (Folsom performance), Phoenix et al received well deserved attention for superb performances all around.
I:12654;2696;Walk The Line shows the legendary singer, Johnny Cash, during his impressive career.
I:12654;2697;This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish and will only make you want to see it again and again, it's that good.
I:12654;2698;With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances.
I:12654;2699;Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies.
I:12654;2700;Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music.
I:12654;2701;the acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man.
I:12654;2702;Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles.
I:12654;2703;His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with.
I:12654;2704;reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her.
I:12654;2705;it's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.
I:12654;2706;I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water.
I:12654;2707;this is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is.
I:12654;2708;Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts.
I:12654;2709;one thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.
I:12654;2710;That is why he is loved by people of all sorts, a very rare type.
I:12654;2711;It even got me to start listening to his music.
I:12654;2712;Walk the Line is a good film with very good performances.
I:12654;2713;Fortunately, the last few musician biopics have married their familiar stories with great performances and good to great directing, enhancing our appreciation of their life.
I:12654;2714;"Last year's ""Ray"" features an outstanding performance by Jamie Foxx, who brings the character to life, with the aid of director Taylor Hackford."
I:12654;2715;joaquin Phoenix does a good job of bringing singer Johnny Cash to life.
I:12654;2716;"at times, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Joaquin Phoenix is doing a good job."""
I:12654;2717;Jamie Foxx managed this on a much more consistent basis, transforming himself into Ray Charles.
I:12654;2718;remarkably, Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did all of their own singing and this is where Phoenix really shines.
I:12654;2719;reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, the love of Johnny Cash's life.
I:12654;2720;I think people are generally much less familiar with her life and her work, so Witherspoon has a great deal more latitude in her performance, building a three dimensional character.
I:12654;2721;"Because she is able to more fully become ""June Carter"", her character is more successful."
I:12654;2722;"Witherspoon brings all of the facets of June's life to the screen
I:12654;2723;I can honestly say I wouldn't recognize a song sung by the real June Carter Cash, so I have nothing to compare her vocal abilities to, but she also sounds good.
I:12654;2724;the two performances are very good, but it is strange that the actor portraying the less recognizable person should be more successful.
I:12654;2725;Both actors are probably doing comparable work, but because we know more about Johnny Cash, recognize him as an icon, Phoenix has to work harder to make his performance seem interesting, believable and real.
I:12654;2726;Ultimately, Phoenix does a better job with the singing and Witherspoon does a better job with her acting.
I:12654;2727;"In ""Walk the Line"", the majority of the film tells the story of Cash's life from twelve year old cotton picker to his performance at Folsom Prison."
I:12654;2728;The performance at Folsom provides a natural climax for the film and his story.
I:12654;2729;And it is a great sequence, with Phoenix channeling the spirit of Johnny Cash, but the real point of this story is the romance between Johnny and June, so the film continues on for a bit until June finally agrees to marry Johnny.
I:12654;2730;This is an interesting moment, and the two clearly loved one another, but the film really should've ended with the performance at Folsom.
I:12654;2731;director James Mangold does a good, if unspectacular job with the material.
I:12654;2732;"The director's previous work includes ""Identity"", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and ""Heavy"", his first film, also an underrated independent film."
I:12654;2733;"With the exception of the turkey ""Kate and Leopold"", Mangold's earlier work contains elements that help it rise above the pack."
I:12654;2734;"In ""Walk the Line""
I:12654;2735;also, there are more than a few scenes involving Johnny, June and a number of other rising musicians touring on the same circuit.
I:12654;2736;These rising musicians included Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison.
I:12654;2737;Jerry Lee Lewis is given the most screen time of the group and the actor playing him, Waylon Payne, seems to have a lot of fun bringing the outrageous musician to life.
I:12654;2738;Then our attention is drawn to the audience is looking at Elvis on stage and the actor playing him.
I:12654;2739;a biopic should teach you something significant about the subject's life, something you didn't already know.
I:12654;2740;"Because ""Walk the Line"" is about two people, we should learn something about both of the characters."
I:12654;2741;"This movie is a fine, if narrowly scoped, drama focusing on the life of Johnny Cash as acted by a searching and posing Joaquin Phoenix (one of the two primary reasons to see this movie
I:12654;2742;Reese Witherspoon as June Carter does a nice turn in the acting department too but she is required to be subtle and, while not played as completely in Cash's shadow, largely is in his shadow for the crux of the movie.
I:12654;2743;It really focuses on Cash growing up and starting out and the tumultuous relationship that he initially shared with June Carter.
I:12654;2744;But mark me Joaquin is on the screen for almost the entire movie and that is why you'll be drawn in and glued to the screen.
I:12654;2745;I knew very little about Cash besides the fact that he died not long ago and a friend is a huge fan of his music.
I:12654;2746;Some really truly great acting from both leads .
I:12654;2747;A compelling, dramatic, and moving story of redemption.
I:12654;2748;I think it actually works a good deal better than if they had tried to fit his whole life in .
I:12654;2749;witherspoon and Phoenix both put in quite amazing vocal performances.
I:12654;2750;Phoenix in particular beautifully portrays Johnny's journey from wannabe gospel singer nervously trying out his own song for a producer right up to the confident rock star with the inmates of Folsom putty in his hands.
I:12654;2751;Acting, singing and playing wise both actors give it their all, and the supporting actors who learned to sing and singers who learned to act all come out smelling of roses.
I:12654;2752;some beautiful and some incredibly powerful scenes .
I:12654;2753;the opening scenes leading up to the death of his brother show that these two young actors are serious talent of the future and they do a beautiful job making real the close friendship that haunts the adult Cash throughout the rest of the film.
I:12654;2754;i could seriously waffle on for ages, I have been so impressed by this movie.
I:12654;2755;It's a keeper and one I am certain I shall watch many times more.
I:12654;2756;This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard.
I:12654;2757;But the movie belongs to its two leads.
I:12654;2758;Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie.
I:12654;2759;It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.
I:12654;2760;the same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress.
I:12654;2761;She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction.
I:12654;2762;the other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side.
I:12654;2763;As Executive Music Producer, T. bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic.
I:12654;2764;"There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that ""Walk The Line"" never loses that air of honesty."
I:12654;2765;"You'll come away from ""Walk The Line"" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured."
I:12654;2766;I love to see the progression of how they got together and became the amazing couple they were, and he the icon he still is.
I:12654;2767;This is a great movie.
I:12654;2768;Walk the Line was an excellent movie.
I:12654;2769;With the balance of entertaining shows of Joquin Phoenix's excellent singing and the drama of his life, the movie moves at a constantly gratifying pace.
I:12654;2770;phoenix's impression of Johnny Cash is an excellent one.
I:12654;2771;"Although he is missing some key elements in Cash's speech (for example why is pronounced with the ""wh"" sound in ""who""), the energy and soul behind his singing and acting is undeniably close to Cash's own personality."
I:12654;2772;with Johnny and June Carter Cash choosing the actors for their own respective roles, the movie comes as close as the real thing as possible, especially for those who are too young to have known Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2773;The movie certainly brought new interest in his music, and only serves as further proof that he is legend and that his music will always be popular, transcending the limitations of genre and era.
I:12654;2774;this being a Collector's Edition, I feel that the value is in the outstanding box and artwork.
I:12654;2775;Always enjoy this film and I get something new out of it each time.
I:12654;2776;and I WAS 'with it' right at the beginning.
I:12654;2777;The sense of things not working persisted for a good half hour into the movie.
I:12654;2778;grading of the importance of Cash's first family.
I:12654;2779;It certainly demeans Cash's character.
I:12654;2780;But the real question is, did the film makers intend that effect and impression?
I:12654;2781;now for the good things, which is much more fun:I don't think June Carter was quite the cute.
I:12654;2782;But I think she and Phoenix managed to pull off very convincingly the love story that is at the heart of all of this.
I:12654;2783;Thing is, in the end.
I:12654;2784;It's a very touching and romantic story, made even more touching because it isn't made up.
I:12654;2785;phoenix and Witherspoon on the stage are dynamite.
I:12654;2786;That was a good decision, though I suspect it was taken more for Hollyweirdesque reasons.
I:12654;2787;His chances of being a decent human being are definitely greater.
I:12654;2788;is what it took to set Johnny Cash's life in order, that's fine with me.4/5 stars overall because of the occasionally.
I:12654;2789;The storyline is well written starting out with his performance at Folsom prison and weaving the story through his life.
I:12654;2790;Enjoyable a fan of Johnny Cash depicts his life well also Joaquin Phoenix played the part well all in all a great film
I:12654;2791;This movie is a good work of fiction, based on the life of Johnnie Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2792;You get drawn in and care about most of the characters, good or bad, because the acting is so excellent.
I:12654;2793;The excellent acting is supported by a very well.
I:12654;2794;crafted screen play with some wonderful lines and scenes.
I:12654;2795;It's a treat if you like good acting.
I:12654;2796;She's quite at home with the Bible.
I:12654;2797;"As Cash said in the 1970s,""I have to take blame for that ."
I:12654;2798;for example, in the mid 1960s as Cash recovered from addiction, many Country artists backed the right.
I:12654;2799;than middle aged music buff like me who remembers those songs and the controversy in Country music circles Cash's friendship and performances with Dylan caused can understand what's involved the way _Walk the Line.
I:12654;2800;They give remarkable performances that make this a worthwhile film, despite its distance from the truth.
I:12654;2801;This is one great movie.
I:12654;2802;he completely captures the feisty and angry spirit of the early Man in Black.
I:12654;2803;His dedication to the role is absolute.
I:12654;2804;I'm not sure why Reese Witherspoon deserved an Oscar over the other contenders for her portrayal of June Carter, but still, she is more than serviceable.
I:12654;2805;extremely moving, inspiring and brimming over with life.
I:12654;2806;eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before.
I:12654;2807;The movie is entertaining, reasonably true to the facts of Johnny Cash life and full of music.
I:12654;2808;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:12654;2809;It is acted superbly (and sung) by both Phoenix and Witherspoon.
I:12654;2810;It details the early life of Johnny Cash and his wife.
I:12654;2811;I've always enjoyed his music, but this movie shows him as so very human , vunerable, even tortured.
I:12654;2812;witherspoon captured the strength of June Carter Cash.
I:12654;2813;Part of this movie details the breakup of Cash's first marriage.
I:12654;2814;"It was painful for his first wife to realize he was in love with June Carter, but there just wasn't any doubt
I:12654;2815;It felt like those 2 souls belonged together.
I:12654;2816;Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job.
I:12654;2817;He should have won the Academy Award for this.
I:12654;2818;4/ 5136 minutesreleased November 18, 2005Walk The Line is an excellent film and is elevated above being a typical biopic by the stellar cast and the performances by the two lead actors.
I:12654;2819;Director James Mangold received acclaim for Cop Land (1997) and Girl, Interrupted (1999, in which Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for best supporting actress.)
I:12654;2820;Phoenix's portrayal is understated and subtle as opposed to being over the top and flashy.
I:12654;2821;It seemed realistic and heartfelt as he struggled through bittersweet moments.
I:12654;2822;He felt guilty about this his whole life.
I:12654;2823;He used to listen to radio broadcasts of the Carter Family, which included a young June, in the 1940s.
I:12654;2824;it's interesting to note that all the Johnny Cash and June Carter vocals were sung by Phoenix and Witherspoon.
I:12654;2825;one of my favorite scenes in the film was the audition for Sam Phillips (1923), owner of Sun Records, the seminal early roots and rock'n'roll label that helped launch Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others.
I:12654;2826;Cash to performed one of his non.
I:12654;2827;This is arguably her best role and is a terrific performance.
I:12654;2828;She's razor sharp and when she's on stage with Phoenix, she's totally convincing as a performer.
I:12654;2829;if you ever wondered how Johnny Cash ended up recording Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison (1968), you get the explanation and see the resistance.
I:12654;2830;For years, he received a ton of fan mail from inmates and incareated men, people who could relate to the songs about lawbreaking and the outlaw life.
I:12654;2831;You also get to see how Cash and June Carter had a chance to develop and solidify their friendship and love.
I:12654;2832;They toured together with a few other artists, and later, together.
I:12654;2833;true, this film is not unlike last year's Ray: poor boy grows up to eventually become hot young star, takes pills, does some womanizing, ends up in the slammer, eventually comes clean and lives out the rest of his life trouble.
I:12654;2834;if you see this film, there's bound to be emotions that you can really relate to.
I:12654;2835;hero oblivion in these 'modern' times.
I:12654;2836;There is memory a friend of mine shared with me of Johnny and June playing back in either the late 80's or early 90's.
I:12654;2837;This film was one of the best movies of the past year.
I:12654;2838;Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for this performance of which he immersed himself in and delivered an amazing performance.
I:12654;2839;Reese Witherspoon was equally as impressive as June Carter Cash capturing her strength and spark.
I:12654;2840;This movie is honest and real.
I:12654;2841;It shows a legend .
I:12654;2842;and I feel it's a brave movie to tell the truth.
I:12654;2843;Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio.
I:12654;2844;pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter.
I:12654;2845;sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2846;though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long.
I:12654;2847;time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil.
I:12654;2848;johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics.
I:12654;2849;Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script.
I:12654;2850;as a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else.
I:12654;2851;The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison.
I:12654;2852;but essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June.
I:12654;2853;That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was.
I:12654;2854;Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail.
I:12654;2855;His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.
I:12654;2856;wALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life.
I:12654;2857;Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.
I:12654;2858;He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas.
I:12654;2859;The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line.
I:12654;2860;the movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.
I:12654;2861;Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down.
I:12654;2862;Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well.
I:12654;2863;Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full.
I:12654;2864;up love, tinged with a lot of lust.
I:12654;2865;June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together.
I:12654;2866;the acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year.
I:12654;2867;Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).
I:12654;2868;The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.
I:12654;2869;the overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?)
I:12654;2870;"That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful
I:12654;2871;There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken.
I:12654;2872;Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.
I:12654;2873;"Joaquin Phonenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny and June Carter Cash in ""Walk the Line"" the true story of the country music legend and the woman who was all the music he ever loved."
I:12654;2874;I see Oscar gold on this masterpiece, Phonenix on fire, he shines,hes marvelous and Witherspoon is an adorable,irresistable little thing.
I:12654;2875;I see Oscar nominations for them both.
I:12654;2876;It's electrifying musical experience to the eye,ear,heart and soul.
I:12654;2877;See it, even if your not a Cash or Carter fan.
I:12654;2878;The actors were great in their roles and the movie was very good.
I:12654;2879;He's brilliant in this .
I:12654;2880;captures the essence of Johnny Cash perfectly.
I:12654;2881;He has the moves down, the voice perfected and that's his voice singing the songs, sounding remarkably like Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2882;I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and have been since I was a little kid.
I:12654;2883;First both did their own singing and did a good job.
I:12654;2884;The story is also excellent and heartwarming.
I:12654;2885;It has funny moments and also very sad moments.
I:12654;2886;But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love.
I:12654;2887;Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor.
I:12654;2888;The story of John and his fathers tension and then finally them declaring a truce and almost reconciling later in life was also heartwarming.
I:12654;2889;this is a very good movie.
I:12654;2890;Even if you are not a Johnny Cash or country music fan you should watch it.
I:12654;2891;My rating is actually pretty kind.
I:12654;2892;I saw Walk the Line in the theater on Thanksgiving Day.
I:12654;2893;Although I am not a country music fan, I have always had a certain amount of respect for Johnny Cash because he was his own man, a true original, and this persona came across in his songs.
I:12654;2894;This element comes through nicely in Walk the Line.
I:12654;2895;joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance in the role of Cash, even getting the accent right.
I:12654;2896;Reese Witherspoon, in the role of June Carter, also gives an electrifying performance.
I:12654;2897;The man in black was a dedicated musician and songwriter, and was totally loyal to his fans.
I:12654;2898;the concert scenes with Phoenix and Witherspoon on stage will make you crank your volume to the max.
I:12654;2899;I actually walked away with a greater appreciation for country.
I:12654;2900;western music and a newfound respect for Johnny Cash's musical legacy after watching Walk the Line.
I:12654;2901;This is an astounding movie and portrayal of Johnny Cash and his wife June.
I:12654;2902;that it's a beautiful love story.
I:12654;2903;The love these two people shared was incredible and amazing!
I:12654;2904;It's brought to magnificent life by Phoenix and Witherspoon who both deserve every award under the son for their performances.
I:12654;2905;which makes their performances even better.
I:12654;2906;i can't stress how great this movie really is.
I:12654;2907;This movie was well written and well acted.
I:12654;2908;It gives a lot of insight about Johnny Cash.
I:12654;2909;Joaquin Phoenix plays the role very well.
I:12654;2910;Reese Witherspoon portrays June Carter Cash as a very strong woman.
I:12654;2911;The movie really shows that Johnny Cash had a lot to overcome in his younger years.
I:12654;2912;He was remarkable for being able to work though his troubled childhood, and she was remarkable for being so strong and standing by him.
I:12654;2913;It's a true testament to the power of love.
I:12654;2914;I do recommend this movie.
I:12654;2915;I thought that what Sam Phillips said to Cash when they first met was the best part of the film.
I:12654;2916;Reese and Joaquin really set the mark for them.
I:12654;2917;What an amazing performance by these two actors and was dumbfounded when knowing that is was their actual voices singing.
I:12654;2918;Amazing and mesmerized by their performance.
I:12654;2919;They may have been loose with time frames and facts but the movie in and of itself was enjoyable.
I:12654;2920;Of special mention is the music and the acting.
I:12654;2921;The selection of songs is good and its fun to have them performed by the actors.
I:12654;2922;Overall the acting is good with Phoenix and Witherspoon shining.
I:12654;2923;Walk the Line joins such stand.
I:12654;2924;phoenix does a good job, though, and is even better at giving the character emotional depth than at singing (he's a very persuasive drug addict!)
I:12654;2925;"Witherspoon, for her part, is terrific at June Carter
I:12654;2926;I was also impressed with Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife.
I:12654;2927;On March 25th, 2008, Fox Home Entertainment released Walk The Line 2.
I:12654;2928;The new scenes range from a few seconds to a minute or two.
I:12654;2929;They range from featurettes about the movies production such as the music, casting.
I:12654;2930;But if you really enjoyed it then an upgrade is warranted.
I:12654;2931;Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job in his protrayal of Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon is transcendent as June Carter.
I:12654;2932;The film covers the period of Johnny Cash's life from his days of growing up during the depression on a cotton farm, to his service in the Air Force in the early 50's, his first records on the Sun label, to his prominance as a country music and American icon in the late 60's.
I:12654;2933;phoenix portrays Cash most appropriately as a simple man with a surprisingly complex edge.
I:12654;2934;Cash wanted to be married, wanted a family, yet probably never loved his first wife.
I:12654;2935;Their love for each other has to be one of the true great love stories of the 20th century.
I:12654;2936;the movie does a good job of capturing why Cash was so likable and became so loved by the public, and also why he was so unlikable and destructive to himself and the people around him.
I:12654;2937;i have to mention the music in this movie, Cash was a contemporary of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins at the dawn of Rock and Roll and often toured with them.
I:12654;2938;Something about a Johnny Cash song, the deep growling vocals and the incessant driving country beat just transcends labels, and the movie does an excellent job of making that point.
I:12654;2939;just a compelling movie about a simple yet complex man.
I:12654;2940;Great, well acted film with a good story.
I:12654;2941;It was powerful and so great!
I:12654;2942;I truly Loved the performances by Resse Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix they were definetly Oscar worthy, in which I HOPE they both win for their pending nominations!!!
I:12654;2943;I can relate to this movie too in a personal matter as well with my man having personal demons in his life.
I:12654;2944;And his singing is wonderful!
I:12654;2945;Witherspoon proved she can do more than play a ditzy blonde.
I:12654;2946;This is for anyone who loves good movies.
I:12654;2947;poor childhood, he struggles in the music industry until he finds his niche and releases on the world a new, incendiary sound that mixes genres and redefines boundaries, all while battling drug addiction and searching for a woman who will make him feel whole.
I:12654;2948;but enough about the Ray Charles movie, let's talk about Walk the Line.
I:12654;2949;foxxes all recent depictions of true.
I:12654;2950;Phoenix's portrayal finds strength in the actor's ability to pay just enough attention to looking and sounding like Cash without letting it overwhelm him.
I:12654;2951;In the song that leant its title to this film, Cash tells us he keeps a close watch on his heart.
I:12654;2952;He builds walls and drapes himself in black, keeping the world away.
I:12654;2953;The mysterious Man in Black loves.
I:12654;2954;Clearly, the film's central story is their love, told from Johnny's point of view.
I:12654;2955;Witherspoon brightens her scenes with a perky energy that masks an inner turmoil equal to Johnny's.
I:12654;2956;On stage, Witherspoon bests Phoenix (a major feat, as he is fantastic) and has a career in country music if this acting thing doesn't work out.
I:12654;2957;Phillips' first meeting with Cash provides the heart of the film, as he tells the young musician to sing as if he only has the chance to sing one song for the rest of his life.
I:12654;2958;Walk the Line has great ambitions when concerning the presentation of the material, but a lot of compromises are made on content.
I:12654;2959;Primarily, it wants to remain faithful to the love story of Johnny and June Carter Cash and present their lives' work in a way that will entertain modern audiences as much as the toe.
I:12654;2960;hard fan of Johnny Cash, you will likely enjoy this movie.
I:12654;2961;His life truly warranted a big screen treatment!
I:12654;2962;The music is terrific and Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give spellbinding performances.
I:12654;2963;"the basic, and a ""collectors"" version with all the great extras."
I:12654;2964;"Being a ""good movie"" and a ""good representation"" are not one in the same."
I:12654;2965;Walk the Line is a fine example of heartfelt movie making, but considering the subject matter, should have been a lot more painful.
I:12654;2966;"Synthesized music, MTV and ""American Idol"" made music more of a visual package and experience."
I:12654;2967;That's talent, raw, pure and clear.
I:12654;2968;Phoenix is a marvel, capturing the essence of Cash's intensity, ambition and pain.
I:12654;2969;"Phillip Seymour Hoffman was extraordinary in ""Capote"" too, and it's a tie as to who deserved the Oscar in 2005."
I:12654;2970;"Somehow, all the performances in ""Walk the Line"" seem credible, real, not as Hollywood."
I:12654;2971;"in ""Walk the Line,"" the chemistry between June Carter and Johnny Cash snaps and sizzles."
I:12654;2972;He's always admired her from afar and has followed her Carter Family career.
I:12654;2973;June is undeniably female, favoring dangling earrings, heels and dresses, but she's grounded, smart and confident.
I:12654;2974;certainly, there's the element that June carries qualities of his beloved older brother, the one who was tragically killed.
I:12654;2975;His older brother acted as a sane, gentle buffer, helping to soften a childhood of backbreaking labor and a harsh father.
I:12654;2976;"considering Phoenix played a calculating, spoiled emperor's son in ""Gladiator,"" he's spectacular as Johnny Cash."
I:12654;2977;She's got real dimension, flexing her acting muscles as an anal.
I:12654;2978;Her intelligence and perceptiveness shine through.
I:12654;2979;female relationships on screen, I prefer seeing a balance of power.
I:12654;2980;But she was his spiritual and intellectual equal, and over the years, he had to earn her trust and respect.
I:12654;2981;Partnerships are more than physical attraction, they're enduring and flexible, strong enough to withstand the stressors and heartaches of everyday life.
I:12654;2982;Johnny Cash and June Carter had that kind of special relationship.
I:12654;2983;The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.
I:12654;2984;this film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s.
I:12654;2985;June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him.
I:12654;2986;both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing.
I:12654;2987;It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent.
I:12654;2988;Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date.
I:12654;2989;As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real.
I:12654;2990;Bought it as a gift for my grandaughter.
I:12654;2991;"Despite a glossy ""Movie of the Week"" vibe that hangs over the proceedings, ""Walk the Line"" utlimately succeeds due mainly to the powerhouse performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who manages to capture Cash's paronoid, pill."
I:12654;2992;How two actors can transform themselves into country singers as convincingly as this is breathtaking, and to give such satisfying, spontaneous and riveting performances is amazing.
I:12654;2993;this is no romantic biopic, it is a gritty slice of real life, the lives of Johnny Cash and June Carter.
I:12654;2994;The acting in this movie was absolutely brilliant!
I:12654;2995;Joaquin Phoenix is probably doing the best role he has ever done.
I:12654;2996;The music itself in this movie makes it worth seeing.
I:12654;2997;I loved this movie and I am sure that you will aswell.
I:12654;2998;If you dont know enything about Johny Cash it is nice introduction.
I:12654;2999;It was entertaining and the music numbers were great, they were the best part of the movie.
I:12654;3000;"I liked Joaquin Phoenix better in ""To Die For"" and I liked Reese Witherspoon better in ""Election""."
I:12654;3001;I think Reese Witherspoon should have won an Oscar for that role rather than this one.
I:12654;3002;But she did a good job with the musical numbers even though she definatley does not have a genuine country voice.
I:12654;3003;"I was more impressed with the music ""bio"" about Ray Charles with Jamie Foxx."
I:12654;3004;It was a much better film than this.
