1;Look at my right eye twitchin'!
2;Eddie Murphy adds a beautiful foil character to the film, allowing us to grow to love a green, snail.
3;Shrek is about an Ogre and a talking Donkey on a journey to rescue a Princess from a fire.
4;there is so much adult humor in this movie!!
5;In all the times I've seen the movie .
6;There's even a song at the end with all of the fairy tale creatures involved .
7;This movie will keep you watching and laughing the whole way thru!
8;Gather friends and watch as a group.
9;the laughs will be even bigger!!
10;This movie is truly one of those rare jewels that comes along once every ten to twenty years.
11;It is destined to be a classic that appeals to both young and old.
12;I laughed and I cried.
13;My daughter and I enjoy this movie so much, we watch it at least twice everyday (We have owned the video since Thanksgiving 2001).
14;Moreover, this movie delivers a very strong message.
15;For me, this movie stands right up there with the classics.
16;I loved to see this movie.
17;This is Eddie Murphy's funniest movie.
18;I want to see it again and again and again.
19;There is a very cool suprise at the end.
20;nevertheless Shrek is a great Film a must see.
21;As a programmer I really wanted to see the difference it made.
22;If you thought Bugs Life is as good as it gets, go watch this.
23;The joy you'll get is worth every penny you pay for it.
24;remember,i said it 1st right here on amazon.
25;the kids eat it up for some reason,but still prefer a lot of other far better childrens movies.
26;Great fun for all of us.
27;I agree that some of the humor may walk the line (like the simpsons), but it is really funny.
28;Everyone in the theater enjoyed the matrix scene and the macarena scene and all the other references to other films.
29;I kind of think that this was the point of a lot of the humor in the movie.
30;For those that watched the movie and don't understand this or have a problem with it, rethink the music you listen to and the software you use.
31;if you're looking for some type of masterpiece movie, I would recommend watching eyes wide shut .
32;For a very good and refreshing laugh, watch Shrek.
33;I did like most of the characters and their voices, Shrek was one of the best.
34;The computer animation was fantastic, much better than Final Fantasy, I thought you could almost think the characters were people in rubber suits.
35;I expected this film to be clever and witty, more like Toy Story or Antz.
36;critics have given it high marks!
37;I mean donkey is the voice of Eddie Murphy and u know how funny he is.
38;the story line may seem childish but you will grow to like it as the movie goes by with funny moments.
39;But this is still a good movie to watch!
40;Shrek is a fun movie.
41;Of course kids will enjoy it because they see it as a cartoon and all kids like cartoons.
42;Shrek is obviously aimed at an older, more mature audience.
43;they aren't bad and Shrek even laughs at himself, a pretty good way to draw laughs.
44;It's the twist in the traditional story line.
45;This is a great concept for a film.
46;This is the best animated film I've ever seen.
47;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are extremely funny.
48;This is one of the best animation movies i've seen till date.
49;its not just cos of the animation that has been presented in the movie but the star cast was also very good.
50;the story is very sensible with some good humor.
51;A must see movie for everyone, kids and adults, cos there is something to learn from this movie .
52;shrek is Homecoming, a revisitation and feel.
53;toe warmth generated from all the twisted yet poignant fairy tales you believed in as a child.
54;The Girl has a dream.
55;and an intensive need for a good gum scraping and tooth whitener.
56;our Faithful Sidekick is an As*, but you gotta love him.
57;eddie Murphy is the Donkey, a babbling but good.
58;She's got her bags packed, her flight tickets checked and she's ready to go.
59;Dreamworks has created a significantly wonderful parody tale with tremendous graphics and a script that will keep you laughing from minute one to end.
60;Some of the lines go right over the children's heads but straight to your brains, and every adult appreciates when these tasty morsels are tossed at us.
61;When Shrek first came out in theaters it was instantly recognized as an animated classic.
62;The script, voices, and animation all combined to create a film that all ages could enjoy.
63;The humor caters to both children and adults, though there are times when the kids won't know why the adults are laughing.
64;And like every good animated fairy tale, Shrek supplies morals to the story .
65;Shrek, for instance, wishes people wouldn't judge him for his appearance.
66;Shrek is a great movie overall.
67;It has a cool plot and funny characters.
68;one strange animal is the Donkey, who knows how to talk.
69;What ensues is a hilarious and cute friendship that brings these two characters together to save the princess for the prince.
70;this movie looks great and is all computer animated.
71;They did a beautiful job making the scenes.
72;The dialogue is witty and interesting.
73;this is definitely a watch.
74;donkey: This jackass is a hoot!
75;Eddie Murphy plays the voice actor and he is as hilarious here as in some of his classic movies.
76;She wants to meet some imaginary prince who will be valiant, strong and handsome which we all know *they're* few, far and in between.
77;"She is pretty yet when dawn approaches she transforms into a ""hideous"" ogre like Shrek."
78;John Lithgow plays his role convincingly.
79;Great to watch with friends and family, too bad the sequel was less than impressive, stick with the original.
80;A fairy tale for everyone.
81;Witty, good natured humor for kids and adults.
82;If you don't own this movie, its definitely worth purchasing!
83;Shrek may well appeal to some adult's tastes but it is certainly NOT an appropriate movie for kids, for many reasons!
84;good story, funny lines, not too dirty for kids and a whole lot of fun.
85;Story line not too dissimilar from beauty and the beast but with a twist.
86;This is among one of the best animated films that I have seen yet.
87;It will have you on the floor.
88;Eddie Murphy was cast extremely well in this film as the donkey, who has incidentally taken on some of his charcteristics which makes the film even better.
89;unlike your usualy disney fairytale, Dreamworks have been able to create a film that has a contemporary feel to it as it combines action, adventure and romance as well as comedy.
90;It will be fun for the whole family!!
91;The animation I adore presents us with the vision of a world that is unaware of the viewer's presence.
92;They let you watch, quite uncaringly, absorbed in the drama.
93;And they can afford that attitude.
94;And in the real life these untall guys succeed in the task very often!The visuals are eerily unsettling.
95;the result was much more tasteful and still hilarious.
96;Shrek is, like, so darn funny!
97;As a matter of fact, it is my second favorite computer animated movie next to Ice Age.
98;It has all sorts of funny and vulgar moments in it, and the characters are well put together.
99;Shrek is both heroic, cool, funny, and everything a big, irritable green ogre should be.
100;"Oh, and the best part concerning Shrek himself(as far as I'm concerned)is the part where he is with Fiona, and she says: ""Wait!"
101;She is very beautiful as a human, and better looking than most ogres when she turns into an ogress at night.
102;She is very feisty and has terrific karate skills which I enjoyed seeing.
103;Finally, she has a good way of snapping when she needs something.
104;Then there's Lord Farquadd, who is an excellent villain.
105;Oh, and speaking of Dragon, here is my opinion on her!
106;She has always been my favorite of all characters in the Shrek movie(due to her power, beauty, grace, and of course amazing knack for being funny)and still is to this day.
107;The fact she's a girl makes it even better, for I love the ladies!
108;This movie is absolutely wonderful, and gutbustingly funny!
109;And for anyone who likes comedy, computer animation, or fairy tales, I recommend this movie to all of them.
110;Love this movie ever since I was younger.
111;So far the best movie of 2001.
112;It has great charm, wit and wall.
113;Eddie Murphy's portrayl of the Donkey is classic.
114;Mike Myers gives Shrek his usual fun, lighthearted and Scottish brand of talent.
115;Animation is excellent and raises the bar.
116;A must have for all ages!
117;Shrek is a great movie.
118;4 year old knows the songs and says Shrek when in the car and a song comes on.
119;They loved it and so did we!
120;The music makes them (and us) want to crank up the surround sound system and get up and dance, and we all laugh hysterically throughout it.
121;While amusing and colorful to watch, it also supports the underlying message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that everyone has feelings to consider.
122;I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to see, or even hear, a fun movie, or who wants to find themselves laughing repeatedly.
123;But it just adds to the attention captured from audiences of all ages.
124;The relationship that Shrek and Donkey have is very nice, funny, heart warming relationship.
125;Myers also did a good job as a big mean oger, I liked the way he made a mean tone in his voice to scare off people.
126;The best part of this movie is the moral of the story: Beauty comes from with in!
127;and most everybody is right!
128;Shrek excels in terms of technique, plot and satire.
129;When the human figures are in the background or blur out as they approach the camera lens, their motion is so realistic they do look like real people.
130;But since most of the inhabitants of this film are not human, they can look pretty much like what the animators wanted them to.
131;Kudos for Shrek, the mean ogre.
132;Notice, too, how marvelous the nature scenes are, especially meadows, forests and those magnificent sunflowers.
133;kids will enjoy the rescue.
134;Truly, this is a fractured fairy tale.
135;off humor made the trip worthwhile.
136;wonderful voiceovers, such as John Lithgow as the prince, Cameron Diaz as the princess, and my favorite, Eddie Murphy as the donkey, who's bouncier that a truckload of superballs and more hyper than a day's worth of Starbuck's.
137;This is a great flick to see even if you don't have kids.
138;This is a great movie for all ages.
139;Shrek was just an ogre that wanted to be left alone.
140;In a quest to regain his swamp, Shrek meets a fast talkin' side kick named Donkey, a beautiful princess, and a whole lot of unexpected surprises on every step of the way.
141;Obstacle after obstacle being conquered, Shrek finds that the biggest test he will face is to trust his heart, and follow it.
142;A hilarious film that will make you fall off your chair, and leave you wishing this most fabulous fairy tale never told didn't have to end.
143;A very disgusting movie, and very funny in the same time.
144;I was really pleased with that.
145;The item also arrived in good condition.
146;Shrek was the greatest time I've had at the movies in years!
147;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy did an astounding job!
148;The animation was ten times better than recent hits, including Pixar's latest works.
149;This is a HIGHLY recommended movie!
150;I never intended to watch Shrek, but when we received it as a gift, I felt obligated.
151;I must admit that I found it surprisingly good.
152;I think the more I watch it, the funnier it gets.
153;Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) is the perfect comic relief.
154;"While Shrek is quite crude at times and frequently is just downright vulgur, the ""moral of the story"" is driven home in a big way with a somewhat surprise ending."
155;Overall, I recommend Shrek to any teen or adult.
156;It turned out to be a wonderful movie.
157;Shrek is a mordern day fairy tale with a big, smelly, ugly orge as its hero, and a wise.
158;Lord Farquaad sends Shrek on a quest to rescue the beatiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Dias) from a castle guarded by a fierce dragon.
159;We love Shrek and could watch it over and over again.
160;The 1st movie is still my favorite.
161;When I first watched this, I thought that the all.
162;and was surprised to find a great animated film.
163;"Witty and warm are two cliches that deserved to be trotted out here
164;Like Disney's Emporer's New Groove , Shrek abandons the sentimental mush and goes for a smart retake on the traditional, Disney.
165;Shrek sets the bar very high for the computer generated film"
166;Michael Myers voices the ogre with a heart of gold using his familiar Scottish accent.
167;That quibble aside, I should say that Donkey is the most perfect marriage of voice and character design I've ever seen in an animated film.
168;Farquad's kingdom Duloc is, in a bit of inspired lunacy, envisioned as a wicked satire of Disneyland, from the huge parking lots (YOU ARE PARKED IN LANCELOT, reads a sign) to a hilarious parody of the Disneyland staple, 'It's A Small World.'
169;Dreamwork's co. founded Jeffrey Katzenberg must have loved it.
170;of documentaries and, maybe best of all, a precious two minutes of Shrek's Karaoke Music Swamp.
171;Shrek is an outstanding animated movie, which essentially spoofs all fairy tale stories, but eventually delivers much more as a heart.
172;warming and hillarious tale about an big green ogre finding his true love.
173;one of those rare movies that can be appeciated equally by a five.year.
174;old, it's just great, fun entertainment for kids and adults.
175;It also conveys important life lessons about the importance of friendship, and the importance of inner beauty over external looks.
176;it's best known however, for its side.
177;spliiting comedy, thanks in great part to Eddie Murphy's extraordinary comedic talents.
178;Shrek 4D at Universal is a real treat to see.
179;There's plenty to love about this movie besides the great writing and wonderful banter between Donkey and Shrek, the animation is superb and the story has lots of under lying humor and subtly.
180;i'd highly recommend this to any as one of the greatest family movies ever, it's worth owning and watching over and over.
181;Anyone will enjoy this movie.
182;Mike Myers brings out one of his funniest voices and teams up with the incredible humor of Eddie Murphy for an unforgettable movie.
183;There are two discs with hours of entertainment.
184;If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it.
185;My whole family saw it and loved it.
186;He, my son, and I laughed throughout the entire movie.
187;Granted, many of the jokes flew over my son's head, but he enjoyed the action.
188;My husband always liked John Lithgow in villianous roles and he and I both agreed that he was perfect as the voice of Farquaad.
189;Eddie Murphy did a wonderful job as the voice of the talking donkey.
190;I also liked the fact that they incorporated the Disney characters in the movie and it was funny watching the Disney Princesses fight at the end.
191;This is a must see movie.
192;though I preferred the second movie for its stronger surprises and twists and turns, the first Shrek holds quite a bit of charm that child and adult both can enjoy.
193;NO, it is not my connection, my connection is great.
194;i love this movie its so funny and its like a fairy tell ha i always loved watching it all the time my favorite character was the donkey who was eddie murphy anyways kids would love this movie even grown ups so this is a movie that you wanna get for the whole family.
195;With all the bodily function jokes and sexual overtones I am surprised it got the rating it did and that people let their small children watch it.
196;It has a few good moments as a fairy tale about love and not judging the book by its cover.
197;It has a refreshing ending but it most certainly does not live up to the hype.
198;Adults will enjoy this movie with it's vast array of stars.
199;With humorous performances by Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek, Eddie Murphy as The Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, John Lithgow as Lord Farquad and the supporting cast of Fairy Tale Things this movie was truly a funny movie.
200;It begins with the introduction of Shrek, an enormous green ogre who lives alone in a swamp.
201;Then through a twist of fate, Eddie Murphy as the hilarious talking donkey enters Shrek's life as his un.
202;Shrek then begins a journey to see Lord Farquad to remove the creatures from his property, who sends him on a journey to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona from the fiery dragon to be his bride so that he may become King.
203;stop as are the laughs in this movie.
204;The ending has the usual twist with hilarious outakes and a kareoke scene by all the characters at the end.
205;Overall, this film is a must.
206;see for children and adults alike.
207;Our whole family just loved this one.
208;My husband and I took our 2 kids to see this movie today and all of us absolutely loved it!
209;My husband and I laughed out loud more in this movie than in any movie, for kids or adults, than we have in years.
210;another pleasant surprise was the soundtrack.
211;All the songs are hits from when we were kids: a new rendition of Petula Clarks's You Belong to Me and ending with Eddie Murphy doing a great job updating The Monkee's song I'm A Believer to end the film.
212;Shrek is a wonderfully delighting humor movie from Dreamworks.
213;But Lord Farquaad has something else in mind.
214;Though the movie is great for all ages, the adults would find something that they like, as well as the kids.
215;Yes, true love's kiss still breaks the spell.
216;This movie will make you feel better about who you are than anything I have ever seen.
217;The message the movie gives, time and again, far outweighs anything else.
218;Every child cant be a princess or marry a prince or have a fairy godmother, but they can be loved for who they are.
219;This movie is funny and clever.
220;It is highly entertaining for children and adults.
221;The most entertaining of these are the technical goofs.
222;Always a great movie, no matter which Shrek!
223;The movie is hilarious as it pokes fun at Disney a lot and was found to be pretty funny.
224;The movie overall does deserves five stars as it lives up to the hype [lack of better word] originally put into it and was ultimately very enjoyable to watch.
225;I could watch this movie again and probably will a great deal of times as it is quite enjoyable.
226;It is a kids movie, but it offers entertainment for adults, too.
227;Without him the second half of the movie wouldn't be very etertaining, but because he is there it is very enjoyable.
228;I would recommend that you see this movie.
229;It's funny, fresh, entertaining and exciting.
230;In fact just about every scene is memorable and every character brilliantly crafted.
231;the story behind `Shrek' is that of Shrek, a grumpy, lonely Ogre.
232;When Lord Farquaad banishes all the fairytale creatures to the forest Shrek finds that his secluded swamp is now more crowded than ever.
233;`Shrek' has a lot of fun poking fun at the very characters and stories that inspired it and this leads to plenty of laughs.
234;helping to create some extremely memorable characters is the cast of vocal talents.
235;Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz tackle the lead roles of Shrek and Fiona and do so splendidly.
236;John Lithgow is hilarious as the devious Lord Farquaad.
237;He adds spunk and humor to every line.
238;"With quick wit and Murphy's signature attitude he creates the perfect companion, the perfect sidekick equipped with an amalgam of memorable and quotable catchphrases (""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!"")"
239;beautifully animated and magically brought to life `Shrek' is the animated film of this generation, a cartoon that paved the way for bigger and better animated spectacles.
240;There is rarely a treat this sweet so dig in and enjoy every last minute of it.
241;a great film as well.
242;I have seen this film so many times and have a blast each time.
243;The timing is perfect, the characters are very well played and the stuff is just funny!
244;This was a good movie, and I'm a teenager.
245;The animation is wonderful and the music is great too.
246;I just got this movie for X. mas, and I finally watched it today, and I thought it was awesome!
247;The voices are so funny, and I really liked the story.
248;The appearance of other fairytale characters was very interesting.
249;THe only good features are the Kareoke and music videos, besides that there is nothing else that is worth watching twice.
250;This is an unique movie.
251;the main characters show their special values and what really counts is inside.
252;i very rarely see a movie more than once but this is a very well thought one in which every time you see it a new perspective comes to your mind.
253;Shrek keeps you entertained from the moment you start to the moment you end.
254;Another great series for family entertainment
255;Great for a family night in.
256;My kids loved it, and it kept the adults laughing too.
257;I got this to complete the Shrek movies.
258;I loved these movies growing up and still enjoy watching it over and over.
259;Aside from the great cast and beautiful animation, the most fun was seeking out the next joke, most of which were made to make fun of Disney, which no one has really attempted to do so much.
260;It was a great film, and we can't get my four year old brother to stop saying, We can stay up late, and in the morning, I can make you WAFFLES!
261;This is by far the best of the Shrek series.
262;This movie is excellent and witty.
263;The best special feature is the Shrek Kariokke party.
264;year old son loves it, specifically Donkey, and makes me play the tape at least once a day.
265;this movie is hysterical, beautifully done, and touching, in it's own way.
266;Besides, all the flatulant humor is a riot!
267;the first two shrek movies are so good.
268;oh well at least we have 2 good shrek movies
269;This movie reminds us all that real beauty is in the inside.
270;Eddie Murphy is hilarious as the donkey sidekick.
271;This movie will make you laugh and feel good at the same time.
272;All kids will love it.
273;Thank you Dreamworks for the hidden adult humor so we can keep our sanity.
274;This movie is funny and entertaining.
275;It has the best actors(Mike Myers) and great animation.
276;Shrek is truly a wonderful movie, in all aspects.
277;The animation is excellent, the dts surround is awesome!
278;Young and old will enjoy this for sure!
279;It's just one of those movies that you can't resist.
280;did more adults or kids love this movie?
281;I know I love it!
282;i still love the movie
283;I loved this movie from the word go !
284;This movie will be liked by anybody who has a funnybone.
285;About the characters, Mike Myers is believable as a Ogre's voice.
286;John Lithgow as Prince Farquaad gives animated villainy a new dimension.
287;Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona's voice shows the spirit of the character so well that you might believe her to be a 21st century career woman.
288;coming to the most delightful character in the movie.
289;Eddie Murphy has us laughing like jackasses with his witty one liners and retorts.
290;After seeing this donkey, if you happen to see a real one, you might just be tempted to talk to it.
291;Shrek himself was pretty funny and Donkey was histerical.
292;But all in all it was a funny movie, worth seeing over and over.
293;(Early on Shrek tears out the and she was awakened by true loves' first kiss page out of his book in disgust and uses it as toilet tissue!)
294;He has all the genius for delivery that Robin Williams exhibited in Aladden, but brings with it his own style, a more direct and more connected sense, that one finds in all of his work.
295;"I hope he does lots of other voice over parts like this in the future
296;mike Meyers is the real surprise, at least to me.
297;Maybe CGI characters are his forte!One of the facits of the work I liked best was the clear message.
298;that happily ever after, love, and happiness do not come packaged in a pretty or handsome face.
299;Although the Disney movie pointed out that, as the old adage has it, handsome is as handsome does, it botched the works by changing the beast into a handsome prince as his reward for being a person worthy of love.
300;Shrek makes it clear that, while a person may not be what the rest of the world considers attractive, they are beautiful as long as the one they love sees them as so.
301;In fact, the movie makes several points important for adults as well as children to learn.
302;the visual effects of the film were impressive.
303;The hair, facial affect, and movement of the characters was very real.
304;Probably the most impressive innovations in the film were in environmental design.
305;Not unlike Beauty and the Beast, Shrek engages the viewer to know beauty is what is beyond the skin.
306;Your kid will play with them, exploring them once or twice, but the movie is the real treat.
307;The mock interviews with the characters are intriguing, and worth watching.
308;Cameron Diaz's princess character looks remarkably like her.
309;eddie Murphy makes a great sidekick.
310;top, but found his voicings to hit the tone perfectly, with great comedic skill.
311;the movie is packed wirth allusions to old great movies and cartoons, mostly Disney, and adults will smile everytime they discover a new line or sequence from a movie they grew up with.
312;Adults of all stripes will be impressed at the deftness with which adult and children's comedy is mixed into a family movie that isn't a sugar and syrup mess.
313;this is witty, sharp, romantic, and goofy.
314;This is a fair point, and I can see why some might object.
315;Shrek plays the role of world policeman, like America.
316;The designers of the wallpaper sure didn't mean there to be but if the will's there, you'll see what you want to see.
317;I watch Red Dwarf because it can be both intelligent and potty mouthed.
318;It's the contrast between the two styles that I like.
319;Funny to some, but not to others.
320;It's effective on diffeent levels, and I enjoy it for the laugh out loud humour and the visual feast of it's graphics.
321;This clever, quirky film allows children to have fun while allowing adults to be amused and not go into diabetic shock from cloying sweetness.
322;Children really do have raunchy humor and enjoy it when they are allowed to be crude and not get in trouble for it!
323;Well worth watching, I recommend it all the way.
324;I would give the movie 4.1/2 stars, because while I enjoyed the barbs and send.
325;You can watch the film with English, Spanish or French audio and subtitles.
326;scenes sequences, the director commentaries, storyboard pitches, games, outtakes, and so much more.
327;It's hours and hours of entertainment in itself.
328;as far as the movie goes, I generally enjoy this film.
329;Eddie Murphy is fantastic as Donkey, showing off once again his ability to successfully bring oddball characters to life.
330;John Lithgow is terrific as well, perfectly devious as Lord Farquad.
331;There are references and jokes in there that shouldn't be heard by younger children, this movie is best for older children, teens, and adults.
332;This is a wonderfully funny movie.
333;For once, there is an actual 'moral' to this movie.
334;The big ogre Shrek slowly opens his heart to everyone, especially the princess.
335;This movie is great for all ages.
336;Shrek is a great movie for kids and adults alike.
337;The humor in the movie is, for the most part, clean, and is great to watch at parties with friends.
338;I really enjoyed watching my 1 year and a half daughter's face when she first saw shrek.
339;she loves to watch this movie and it keeps her attention from begining to end!
340;The characters are so amazingly realistic they could be almost live.
341;In the very beginning, Shrek was a HAPPY loner who enjoyed leading his solitary life out in the swamp and Princess Fiona was such a cool, self.
342;confident young woman who could do some dazzling ninja stunts.
343;once a beautiful young human lady who can look out for herself, Fiona is now a dowdy old trollop with weight and self.
344;*shudder* So please, ENOUGH of the Disneyesque politically.
345;granddaughter is thrilled to be able to watch these movies at home.
346;subtle potty humor to appeal to the older children and a timeless story about a princess in distress, although with a bit of a twist.
347;Overall, a fun movie, one oyu can watch over over again.
348;The wife and I took our two 4 yr old boys to see this movie yesterday and we all loved it.
349;And he's funny all over.
350;The name is Shrek, and he and his movie are one of the best things to come out of animation in a long time.
351;I am kicking myself right now that it took me three years to finally see this magnificent gem of a film.
352;Animation has really taken great leaps and bounds in the last ten years.
353;The technology was more breathtaking and the imagery was as clear, precise, and beautiful as it can get.
354;It's animation was so detailed and rich, that sometimes you thought something looked real.
355;I was also astounded by the clarity and sharpness of the animation to this film.
356;Shrek The Ogre(voiced by Mike Meyers)lives alone in his swamp until one day he befriends a donkey(hilariously voiced by Eddie Murphy).
357;With the help of his new friend donkey, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad.
358;If Shrek finds and brings back Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz), so that Farquaad can marry her and become a king, then Farquaad will give Shrek back his peaceful living existence.
359;Then it's off for our two heroes to find and bring back the lovely princess.
360;What follows is a fun adventure that has our two guys trying to save the princess from a scary castle and fire breathing dragon.
361;The humor can get quite adult, as well as some of the dialogue.
362;I was quite surprised when I heard some things in the film.
363;This is what sets it apart from the pact, among a few other things, and it is it's riskiness in this area that makes the film stronger than most every other animation film.
364;The voice talent is well cast and brilliant.
365;Lithgow brings his usual brilliance to give a big voice to an evil character that is small in stature.
366;But it's Murphy that gives the best performance and gives the movie most of it's bite.
367;The characters, thanks in big part to the incredible cast, all have their own distinction and character to them.
368;It's kind of like """"Moulin Rouge"""" in that regard."""
369;The movie is so cleverly put together, intelligently written, and brilliant in it's artistic delivery, that it can't be classified as anything less than an animation classic and treasure.
370;This films appeals to all ages with it's animation, story, and dialogue.
371;If you haven't seen it, it really IS worth a viewing.
372;To start, he animation is good, and there are a few good visual jokes.
373;The unlikely pair, an ogre and his very funny and lovable donkey embark upon a quest.
374;the princess' secret, Shrek's change of heart and the lovable donkey are all potent ingredients to a very funny parody.
375;This unlikely trio run into a series of surprise snags and viewers are treated to something that is completely unpredictable.
376;the interaction will bring gales of laughter from viewers and the high.
377;tech animation will delight the eyes.
378;This is one fairy tale many an adult will love.
379;You'll love Eddy Murphy as the donkey.
380;he is soo cute and funny.
381;All age groups will love it.
382;(Of course, there's also a very funny riff on Disneyland when Shrek arrives to see Lord Farquar, but that's really it for pure Disney.
383;well, that sounds about right) and the nerve to say that the princess/Prince Charming fantasy so many fairy tales were built around is garbage.
384;Surprisingly, Shrek steers around the pitfalls and never becomes cloying or trite or gives up on its own cockeyed realist view of fairy tales and destructive fantasies (as opposed to the perfectly fine and rather sweet, in their own dim way, fairy tale creatures endangered by the evil pro.
385;while it's the writing that really makes Shrek work, John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy fling themselves into their roles, making what could have been fairly generic animated characters into memorable performances.
386;Shrek is that rarest of animated movies: One that's genuinely fun for the whole family.
387;See it with or without kids, but see it.
388;highly recommended for kids from 8.80.
389;I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes.
390;old girls infront of me found me amusing, if not bizarre.
391;Great lines, great characters, appeal for everyone .
392;well these don't fit the mold, which adds a twist you won't soon forget.
393;This movie is a classic that will be a classic forever after.
394;In this adventerous comedy, Mike Meyers portrays an independent and moody ogre with his own sense of humor.
395;He plays the part perfectly.
396;She plays the part very well.
397;Donkey, the funny, cute, and witty little donkey with a big mouth, it portrayed by Eddie Murphey and is perfectly executed.
398;this movie is very funny, and combines all types of comedy in one.
399;The graphics are very good for a movie as old as Shrek is.
400;This movie is an instant classic and is great for family movie night.
401;This movie hits the spot.
402;She and I love to watch this movie.
403;Shrek is a great film when you consider it has a lot of fun pop.
404;culture jokes and amazing animation (look for the scene with the grass hill and watch the grass)It's weakest element is the storyline .
405;a few holes are in it but it still manages to hold together.
406;The overall look, feel and laughter are infectious and you will enjoy this no matter the age, no matter if kids are in tow or not.
407;As the title says, this was cute.
408;There is 'potty humor' about gas and the like, and I caught one instance of a swear word (da.)
409;, but otherwise it was a fine choice.
410;Funny family movie that has a lasting legacy for decades to come
411;One can't really call this a children's movie, even with it's fairy tale charm and animated characters.
412;People of all ages will love the time.
413;honored tale of Beauty and the Beast .
414;with a twist, shall I say?
415;run by fairy tale creatures .
416;Lord Farquar and Shrek make a deal: Shrek and the donkey rescue the Princess Fiona to be Lord Farquar's bride and Shrek will get his homey little swamp back.
417;I thought I had ordered Shrek 3 from NetFlix but received the first one instead.
418;I had seen it earlier and since I truly enjoyed it, I decided to watch it again.
419;It was just as entertaining as I remembered.
420;Shrek is pleasantly surprised when he learns her secret, and I think you will be too.
421;I'm sure you'll enjoy this simple story that's brought to life by such lovable characters.
422;They'll have to be really good to be as good as this first one, but I hope they are.
423;I have seen this movie multiple times and continue to laugh as hard as my kids do.
424;Shrek is a refreshing taste of something new.
425;It had a surprise ending!
426;Every fairy tale now a days is the same as the one that came out before it.
427;The Princess is saved, everyone turns into a human all pretty and skinny.
428;It had wonderful actors that were just right for their part.
429;The plot was excellent and everything flowed into one another.
430;Mike Meyers was awsome and performed the way he always does, excellent.
431;Dreamworks Shrek may be one of the best animated movies of all time.
432;Many of todays animated features borrow from the Shrek formula.
433;Where else can one have an animated movie that appeals to both kids and adults equally?
434;What a fun movie where classic fairy tale creatures and characters get warped and turned inside out from their classically accepted and told tales.
435;I love Shrek, Mrs Shrek, the donkey and the pink dragon.
436;And, oh, how the grateful villagers celebrated!
437;animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers.
438;animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers, not a Disney production, and is proud of it.
439;"sHREK is unlike Disney in the sense that this story is a fractured fairy tale, while Disney has a more serious tone to its pictures
440;many of which are Disney.
441;Assisted by his crazy sidekick, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the story takes on some interesting twists and turns, infused with sharp wit and humor.
442;This is a funny movie, full of one.
443;the animation is similar to that of ANTZ, a very good computer.
444;This makes it a very entertaining film for all.
445;As for a moral to the story, there is one, and it gives meaning and substance to this fractured fairytale"
446;When you watch Shrek you will be amazed at the artistic genius that allows this computerized world to come to life.
447;Mike Myers voices Shrek and does a great job but from the first scenes we know Shrek in an Ogre who only appears mean to hide the low self esteem he harbors.
448;eddie Murphy voices the donkey, the trusty side kick to Shrek who always has a wise crack to make but is truly Shreks friend when it counts.
449;Parts of it are satire on Disney films, parts are satire on fairy tales, and parts are blatant morality tales.
450;This is a good movie, just not the best movie that was ever made.
451;THe Shrek Special Edition that was released today (Nov.2,2001)contains two discs: the movie itself on one disc and commentary and special features on another.
452;disc Special Edition)~ Guillaume Aretos (II) is a very good animated from SKG.
453;The storyline is amazing, the dialogue is quik and witty.
454;Some of the scenes are comedy at its best and like the entire dragon scene and the scene in the begining with all the faires.
455;But to my big surprise I love it.
456;The music is also very good even though some of the songs are a bit cheesy.
457;This movie I highly recommend.
458;In addition, Lord Farquaar has decided that Shrek's swamp makes a fine refugee camp for fairy tale creatures.
459;the bare bones of this story only hints at the wonderfully demented sensibility of this movie, and the delightful ways familiar fairy tales are turned on their heads.
460;liners and instances of potty humor.
461;hurts movie will entertain the entire family.
462;This is one of the best movies I have seen in ages.
463;It is rare treat finding a movie that is both as entertaining and intelligent as this one.
464;There is some potty humour, especially during the opening credits, but this is only a small part of the movie.
465;The rest of the movie is a wonderful satire of fairy tales, twisting around such common notions as ugly = evil and beautiful = good, and pokes fun at the capitalist power.
466;In order to get back his privacy, Shrek makes a deal with the tyrant to retrieve a bride.
467;Joining him on his quest is a talking mule voiced by Eddie Murphy who is, to my pleasant surprise, actually very amusing.
468;All of the voice talents pull off a wonderful job, and the computer animation is some of the best I've ever seen.
469;this film strongly appeals to an adult audience.
470;once again, Dreamworks has done an excellent job.
471;Forget exploding battleships, cheesey love stories and mummies, SHREK is going to be the movie of the summer!
472;It is the most hilarious romp I've seen for ages with what is probably Eddie Murphy's greatest performance to date.
473;up of every fairy tale you've ever loved including quite a few pokes at Disney!
474;It looks fabulous too, even better animation than Pixar's latest movies.
475;This is going to be a SHREK summer.
476;This is a Great Movie, especially the Donkey.
477;Everytime he opened up his mouth he busted me up with laughter.
478;and that's half the fun!
479;Eddie Murphy fills in the other half of the fun.
480;This was one of the funniest animated features I have seen.
481;There is some very adult humor in it, but it's good for kids too.
482;Princess Fiona is the highlight of the movie, and one of the best fairy tale princesses to date.
483;Shrek, voiced by Mike Meyers, was unbelieveably funny.
484;I would recommend this to anyone.
485;Each of the two discs (full screen and letterbox) had enough glitches to completely RUIN an otherwise enjoyable film.
486;I have probably watched this movie 10 times since i bought it last month, and I laugh out loud every time.
487;The animation is incredibly lifelike and fits the manner in which lines are said.
488;the script is incredibly witty, funny for little kids, all the way up to adults (even funny for teenagers like me).
489;You have to give this movie a shot, it is one of my all.
490;The Best part 9is when.
491;Like you can make re.
492;make the movie with your own voice!!!
493;This movie will suck you in early and never let go.
494;Eddie Murphy is the perfect role for the donkey.
495;The story is a great one with an even better message for children and adults alike!
496;The music is fantastic (check out the soundtrack) and the special features on this 2 disc set make it an extraordinary value.

498;Shrek is for older children and for us grownups.
499;shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a big green ogre with the temperament that goes along with the job description.
500;He's always been left alone because everyone is scared of him, and that's just fine with him, as we see from the opening scenes of exposition.
501;through a series of fairy tale turns, Shrek finds himself on a quest to release a beautiful princess from a dragon, where she (voice of Cameron Diaz) has been trapped by a horrifying dragon.
502;It's not giving much away to say that the story otherwise seldom resembles the tales inferred by those Rapunzel/Snow White/Sleeping Beauty trappings, but there is a familiar yet uniquely handled moral to this story that warms one's heart in spite of itself.
503;Shrek walks the tightrope very nicely between being a grown.
504;up take on fairy tales and still providing a solidly positive message.
505;If you loved Babe or Beauty and the Beast, you'll love SHREK.
506;Kids are going to love this movie, and adults are going to enjoy it just as much.
507;This movie WILL be one of the biggest of the entire summer.
508;This movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.
509;It is definitely the best one I've seen in the last year or so.
510;It is a very smart movie that will appeal to all ages.
511;In addition to being beautifully animated and well.
512;voiced, it is also extremely funny.
513;It is entertaining and deep enough to reach people of all ages.
514;In other words, Shrek is a MUST.

516;It is hillariously funny, musical great for all ages.
517;That is 5 times I've seen this movie and I know a great movie when I see one!
518;Perhaps one of the best all around movie out there, animated or not.
519;The chemistry between Donkey and Shrek is hysterical.
520;I laughed for days about that.
521;Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom.

536;The storyline (basically Beauty and the Beast) is timeless, and the comedy manages to stand on its own in a movie that pushes the outer.
537;Eddie Murphy is at his best playing the Donkey, and Mike Myers may also have put in his best cinematic performance to date.
538;Shrek is one of the few animated films ever made that should be seen by adults who don't have children (in other words, those who otherwise wouldn't bother to see an animated film).
539;My daughter (3) loves this video.
540;It delivers the multilayered story that characterizes many of the best animations.
541;As an adult, I loved the good.
542;the story steals from many fairy tales, including The Princess Bride, in a way that is derivative yet fresh, twisting old conventions for humor.
543;Yes, you can see where it's going, but the journey remains fun.
544;The computer animation is excellent.
545;See it with or without kids.
546;This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
547;The princess simply steals the show here, and in the Matrix scene.
548;libs also are worth good laughs.
549;adults and teens will get more from the humor, although I'm sure little kids love the animation.
550;Bought all 3 shrek movies for my grand children,grat kiddie movie, what can you say but great.
551;A great movie with clever writting, and a sarcastic tone.
552;The donkey curses one or two times, and Shrek says Jack*** a couple of times, played for laughs.
553;Watch it first without the kids.
554;emotional Impact:8/10The emotional impact was pretty good .
555;When there were funny parts , you laugh , but there were some parts I did not think were either sad , funny , or exciting .
556;i would highly recommend the movie to family and friends.
557;Very much enjoyable my children loved it.
558;Yes, the film was Shrek.
559;The film is simply remarkable, and boasts a fantastic script, beautiful animation, extremely humorous dialogue and some great twists.
560;With all this secured, it is a film that is sure to appeal to people of all ages.
561;Along with an outrageous and hilarious talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has squeezed in with the other squatters, Shrek decides to pay a visit to Lord Farquaad demanding answers and a reasonable conclusion for the squatters incident.
562;If the mission is a success, Shrek will be free to rule his swamp without any squatters.
563;The action begins, along with the humour.
564;The two argue all the time, but make a great comedy.
565;Mike Myers fills his role as Shrek with a determined effort that shines throughout the entire film, and makes you feel a range of emotions for the giant but gentle ogre.
566;The compassion he emits in his voice for Shrek is wonderful.
567;Eddie Murphy is equally successful in providing a simply triumphant voice for the donkey.
568;"Personality wise, the two have a lot in common
569;And while the donkey is not the central part of the storyline, he definitely provides the most laughs and has some classic scenes.
570;Princess Fiona is a brilliant character, but Diaz is the dull link in a chain of excellent and radiant aspects of this film.
571;DreamWorks takes advantage of Disney's recent slump, showing them how brilliant child's comedy films should be made.
572;Overall, this is a fabulous film that appeals to all ages, has a witty and charming conclusion, and is destined to become a future classic.
573;A film that is definitely worthy of a sequel, Shrek is a winner on all accounts!
574;This is a great movie for kids and adults (lots of adult humor that the kid will not get)!!
575;Donkey shows perseverance and unconditional love and friendship.
576;Lady Ogre learns to accept the beauty of who she really is and learns she can be loved for who she really is.
577;This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.
578;I agree that both are great funny family movies, but that's as far as the comparison can go.
579;Shrek has it's own original flavor.
580;I was happy with the mix of actors used for this movie.
581;They worked well together and made a fantasy have believable characters.
582;I was impressed with how well Michael Myers pulled off the Scottish accent.
583;As a highschooler I loved this movie, the humor and jokes were right on par.
584;Dreamworks studios again attempted to create the perfect balance with its animated feature """"Shrek."""""""
585;"I enjoyed the movie ""Shrek."""
586;I have been entertained each time I've watched it.
587;"There are elements of the film that children would enjoy, just like there are elements of drugs and alcohol that children would enjoy
588;As an adult, I have the cognitive ability to watch and enjoy this film.
589;I can filter out the jokes that are too crude or crass for my tastes and enjoy the finer aspects of the story, such as the emphasis on true beauty coming from within.
590;She is a child, and it is my responsibility to protect her until she is old enough to fend for herself.
591;Shrek is a movie that was created for adults and marketed to children.
592;This 'kid's film' is a winner.
593;Wish I'd done it ages ago!
594;I could write about how muc i loved this movie and probably also quote everything word for word, but I wont.

596;I enjoyed the little song.

600;Just when you think you've seen them all, Dreamworks comes out with Shrek.
601;New and impressive animation style to a wonderful story.
602;Recomend this one for all ages.
603;It is a great movie and most of the humor (although clean in general) is suggestive of things that only older people would get.
604;Movie was very funny, it had been a while since I had seen it but was still hilariously funny funny.
605;Myers is the voice of Shrek, the ogre, and he really gets into it and gives it all he's got.
606;The story is a fairy tale with Shrek going to retrieve the heroine to marry villain John Lithgow.
607;Shrek begins to fall in love with her himself but can a beautiful princess fall in love with an ogre?
608;There's even a surprising twist involving the princess and her great beauty.
609;If you are looking for a film which the whole family can see together, this is it.
610;This movie is really good, and my daughter was finally old enough to watch it.
611;Also invading his privacy is a smart.
612;But true love wins out in the end.

620;They'll be laughing right along with it.
621;No scratches or damages and a cute movie!
622;Full of humor at all levels.
623;Scathingly funny for adults and a total kick for kids.
624;This is one of my all time favorites.
625;I love this movie ever since it first came out so I decided to order one since my other one got messed up.
626;It's funny and though that my toddler would enjoy it as well.
627;Watching the movie again, I still laughed at everything (especially the gingerbread man and magic mirror scene.
628;possibly the best scene in the movie), something that is rare when watching comedies (i. e. Something about Mary.
629;It is something you can enjoy all year round!!!
630;This is a mildly entertaining flick that was released to capitalize on the newest animation technology.
631;John Lithgow, on the other hand, is hilarious with his deadpan delivery.
632;The funniest scene in the movie is between Lithgow's Prince Fahrquod and the Gingerbread Man.
633;Consider this: a movie which is enjoyable for children but also contains humor suited for adults.
634;Shrek flies over these borders with an excellent plot, good character development, and outrageosly funny laughs.
635;The music surrounding the film is top notch and the creativity is phenomenol!
636;The voices match the characters petfectly!
637;Great for kids of ALL ages.
638;Shrek deserves 10 stars in my book.
639;It's a movie for all ages.
640;Every character and every voice is played very well.
641;It's just plan out fun.
642;great movie for all to see.
643;It is funny and sad.
644;It has a special meaning for all to share.
645;It's got a great plot and is very creative with analogies to other movies and fairy tales.
646;But, you can read professional reviews to discover all that.
647;The extras on the disk are fantastic .
648;interviews with the stars, information about how it was made and so on.
649;Shrek is a fairy tale, a buddy picture, and a romantic comedy.
650;In short, this is a movie for just about everyone!
651;Aided by a talking donkey (played wonderfully by Eddie Murphy), Shrek journies to Farquand's castle and gets roped into a quest.
652;It even has a message (albeit one undercut by some of its own humor) worth hearing.
653;The dual disc allows you to see the movie either full frame or wide screen, and both are choke full of faux interviews with 'the cast', storyboards, games, music videos, and who knows what else (I haven't found any easter eggs, but I haven't looked).
654;SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike.
655;tale characters Shrek's peace and solitude is disrupted especially by the talkative Donkey.
656;Shrek makes his way to Farquaad's realm of Duloc, where the Lord promises makes Shrek and offer: He will rid Shrek's land of the unwanted visitors if Shrek will go on a simple quest to free Princess Fiona from her remote, dragon.
657;On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realizing that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be.
658;the Donkey's least likely love the Dragon keeps you smiling.
659;The Princess with her dark secret keeps you crossing your fingers that all will go well.
660;Shrek himself mellowing to the warmth of love.
661;Interesting for the romantic at heart and kids still into fairy tales.
662;The plot is cute, the characters and performances were outstanding, and the visuals were very impressive.
663;For that, I recommend South Park, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.
664;Great story, funny movie, funny characters.
665;Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
666;I think this is the best family movie I have seen in a long time.
667;I think the casting was perfect, and everyone was wonderful in the movie.
668;Everyone should go see this movie!
669;When I saw the first part of the show,my eyes sticked to the screen as it was very enthralling.
670;i especially liked the talking donkey which could flatter people as he makes me laugh.
671;the King Faaquad sends all these creatures to the ogre's place.
672;the dragon was so touched by what the donkey said until the dragon fell in love with the donkey.
673;that was the best part in the show.
674;on the wedding day,the donkey told Shrek what actually happened.
675;will Shrek manage to get his beloved love back?
676;Shrek is a wonderful fairy.
677;tale film exciting and funny enough for the whole family to see.
678;Mike Myers plays an adorable ogre with a friendly side.
679;The comedy in the film is, at times, over the heads of the younger audience but they will still laugh right along with the adults because the humor keeps rolling.
680;Her performance is just plain cute.
681;The movie has a strong story.
682;line, the animation is excellent, and the characters are played beautifully.
683;This is a funny, funny movie.
684;You should definitely go see it, but be aware that it has a satirical edge that makes it more like Wayne's World than Snow White .
685;for those of you who are recent fans of Mike Myers (post Wayne's World and Austin Powers ), you should definitely check out So I Married an Axe.
686;This is in part because his humor is really an extension of his stand.
687;served by the script this time, a similar fate to that which regularly befalls the hilariously funny Chris Rock.
688;(If you want to see Rock at his best, watch his comedy show on cable.
689;A small hint of his talent can be found in Nurse Betty where he is outstanding.
690;But check her out in Being John Malkovich a very funny (though ultimately rather dark)art.
691;This movie is a good example of what can be done with a reasonably funny (with the exception of Donkey) script and great comedic talent.
692;funny scene in this movie, where the gingerbread man cookie says eat me.
693;The film did win for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it was also Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.
694;One of the best films of 2001, an Instant Classic for the Young and Old.
695;I saw it, and I don't even have kids!
696;Eddie Murphy was awesome as usual, and Mike Myers of course was a treat.
697;It was a great movie.
698;great movie for the hole family!
699;Shrek is the perfect film for a not so perfect family.
700;This is what makes Shrek plenty of fun.
701;Everytime an eventual adventure approaches him, Shrek always reluctantly steps up to the plate.
702;That's brilliantly funny since Mike Myers provides a Scottish type accent.
703;Not too handsome and not too ugly, Shrek can somehow convince you that he can steal a princess' heart.
704;Princess Fiona boasts the best computer animation and Cameron Diaz provided a good voice for her.
705;The comic relief of this tale is Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy.
706;I'm sure it will for you too.
707;He is a villain filled with an egotistical mind and an eye for a dream kingdom.
708;The seamless computer animation and the talented voice actors.
709;All make a great story seem greater.
710;I kept hearing everyone rave about it, yet I still would not see it.
711;The way they incorporated other fairytales was wonderfully amusing.
712;I am such a fan of this movie, now.
713;The animation was absolutley superb, too.
714;Give it a chance, and you will love it.
715;Shrek is a movie that both the young and the adults can easily enjoy.
716;Rescue a princess he wants to marry, slay the dragon and the creatures will be removed.
717;the humor is both for adults and children, and hardly a minute goes by without the audience laughing.
718;This movie is full of fantastic action.
719;Shrek reminds me of Herman Munster with his strength, and Shrek is full of courage.
720;the movie is funny and has action that will put you on the edge of your seat.
721;check it out (especially if you want to watch a movie with your kids).
722;Quite pleased in the amount of time it took to get to me, although it wasn't in a bubble wrapped envelope.
723;I loved this movie before I had kids, and love it even more now.
724;My kids love the story of Shrek and Fiona!
725;Donkey is, of course, one of their favorite movie characters of all time!
726;All of the actors did a great job voicing the characters.
727;This movie has enough great one.
728;liners to make any one who likes to drop movie lines happy.
729;eddie Murphy is great as Donkey .
730;I especially liked the part where Shrek tells Princess Fionna that the only trick about his talking donkey is getting him to shut up.
731;mike Myers nailed it as Shrek, simply great.
732;But if you do, this would make a great gift.
733;Finally, someone came out with something fairly original in the fairy tale.
734;Funny jokes for adults and kids.
735;Nice animation (check out the bloopers), plot moves along to keep everyone entertained.
736;As always Eddie Murphy is genius(great cast).
737;I especially love the karaoke music video at the end.
738;Although marketed as a kids' movie, SHREK is one of those films with layers.
739;Our antihero is a reclusive green scary ogre (Shrek, voiced by the excellent Mike Myers) who lives in a swamp.
740;His sidekick, an enthusiastic talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has decided that Shrek is his best friend.
741;"On arriving in Duloc, Shrek finds himself caught in the middle of a competition of knights to see which one will earn the ""right"" to rescue a sleeping Princess Fiona from a castle."
742;It's a perfect example of how fond Shrek has become of his friend, although he would never admit it.
743;breathing monster comes after her and Shrek.
744;which she finds in the form of Donkey.
745;The Merry Men show up, of course, and do a bit of Riverdance.
746;And how could a beautiful princess like Fiona ever love such a hideous beast as him?But the beauty of this film is that these misfits .
747;It plays with the stereotypical fairy tale characters (lord, ogre, princess) and turns them on their head, while giving us a happy ending that tells us that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and that love and friendship are wonderful things to have.
748;So the moral of the story is . . . ogres are really lovely people, talking donkeys are fun to have around, and if you're an evil diminutive ruler of a kingdom, you might just get eaten by a dragon.
749;Finally introduced my 5 year old son to this movie, which I've loved for many years since I first saw as a college student!
750;This one ranks right alongside some of Pixar's best (though not Pixar!)
751;, and can be enjoyed by both children and adults.
752;Thank You Amazon for having such great real time reviews for me to read!!!!!
753;The voices were great .
754;don't judge a book by its cover, and everyone has qualities to love.
755;line language and bathroom humor .
756;but WE laughed at it all and were not offended.
757;When we left the movie, my husband and I both commented what a terrific movie it was and that we would not hesitate to see it again.
758;I am a big fan of CG.
759;Dear viewers, Just got back from seeing it and it was an excellent movie.
760;It was a very hilarious movie.
761;i recommend people that are fans of Eddie Murphy,Cameron Diaz,and Mike Myers will love it.
762;the graphics are very good!!!!
763;After I got finished watching this movie, I thought that movie was great.
764;This is truly a movie for all ages!
765;It will capture the hearts of all ages!
766;The little princess was beautiful and the talking mule was hysterical (thank you Eddy Murphy for being Eddy Murphy).
767;I personally loved the 3 little pigs break dancing and the little elves singing rap!
768;A hit for all ages!
769;I am sure this will be a treasure ranked up there with Snow White and the other classics.
770;But I am happy with my movie!
771;Everybody in my class had to see Shrek and we all loved it.
772;All the fairy tale characters are in it aswell as the Gingerbread man (who is funny).
773;This was a great movie fro all ages.
774;It was funny and touching.
775;It had good morals and good jokes.
776;This is a must see for eveyone!
777;The colors in this animated film are beautiful, just spectacular at times.
778;art artwork, which is what we are seeing more and more this century as animated films continue to do well at the box office and impress the public and critics.
779;There are lots of extras on the two.
780;By the third Shrek, the story had gotten stale but the animation continues to astound, especially with Blu.
781;It's a pretty funny movie and there're some moment that'll make you burst out laughing, but I felt that Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy's performancer her toned down.
782;These are two of the funniest men in hollywood and if given the freedom, they could have made one of the funniest films ever, but that's not the case.
783;John Lithgow is a wonderfully incomptent villian.
784;His role let him really strut his stuff and show of his comedi skillsThe graphics in this film are really nice.
785;They remind me of video game graphics in their style, but they're much smoother and more detailed In my opinion, the best part of this movie were the stabs towards Disney and the totally twisted takes on fairy tale character (the interigation of the ginger bread man in priceless)All in all, this is a good film to kill a couple of hours, it's fun and a decent film for the entire family
786;A fun and funny movie, Shrek delivers us with good fun!
787;This movie is a great family movie .
788;Entertaining and smart is what 2 say about this movie.
789;The characters in this movie is so funny.
790;hey, that's half the fun!
791;It's a good one from Dreamworks!
792;Everyone loved it, including all the chaperones and me!
793;It was great seeing fastasy characters out of the norm .
794;When a good lady friend insisted that I watch a movie.
795;and the friend's company was worth so very much more than a trivial period of discomfort, so I went with her.
796;ahh, the heck with that metaphor, they made a fine movie.
797;the movie Shrek both inhabits the fairy tale genre and sends it up without a trace of self.
798;tale kingdom, and Cameron Diaz is refreshing as the much.
799;I came away from the film with sidestitches from laughing.
800;when Spielberg sets himself a task, even as seemingly trivial a job as an animated feature, he almost always delivers a benchmark product, and this is no exception.
801;well, the ending is something special, and quite unexpected.
802;It's just a great ending, trust me.
803;generated viewing experience that is Shrek.
804;it's one of those movies you watch again and again.
805;This is the best one though in my humble opinion.
806;If you think all fairytales should feature a tender.
807;hearted, beautiful heroine and a handsome prince, both almost perfect and even their imperfections attractive to us (like Ariel's stubborness, for example) than this movie is not for you.
808;Our hero is an ogre who shuns people and eats eyes.
809;Our heroine is a princess who is well.
810;Also, it ridiculizes many other cartoons with its backwards humor, or movies like the Matrix.
811;the ever present funny character .
812;still, the movie IS funny and very, very enjoyable.
813;And the basic meaning of the story, that is that you do not have to be physically perfect in order to find true love, is a very, very welcome change and very, very true.
814;This movie is so hilarious.
815;Great for adults and Kids.
816;I loved the ending the most when all of Walt Disney World dances.
817;I love this film and I am not even a kid.
818;but still a great and very original and a first comedy for Pixar.
819;Good movie, not the best, but worth watching anyhoo.
820;This movie takes a modern look at classic fairy tales.
821;It is well done, if occasionally crude.
822;There is a great deal of subtle things worked into the background, making the movie interesting for children as well as adults.
823;I sometimes manage to be among the last individuals on earth to see a blockbuster movie, and such is the case with Shrek.
824;Having finally seen the film, however, I will certainly echo the high praises it has received from those who have come before me.
825;Shrek is visually stunning, continuously hilarious, and uplifting in its message.
826;It's fun for the entire family, appealing to adults and children in equal measure, and it just makes you feel good after the credits roll.
827;"the look of this film is amazing
828;first century, and the guys and gals at Dreamworks are forging the way ever onward and upward.
829;You really have to see the animation in Shrek to appreciate it .
830;I can tell you that it is in stunning 3.
831;d detail, that each character has more incredibly realistic and subtle facial expressions than I do, that you could sometimes swear (especially when watching Princess Fiona) that you are watching real people on the screen, and that Shrek transports you to a world unlike any you have seen before, but that barely begins to describe the animation magic at play here.
832;The real proof of the pudding is in the details, and you will be amazed at all the subtle nuances you pick up each time you watch the film: you can see the wind in the grass, leaves blowing, dust rising, clothes wrinkling and moving naturally in relation to each character's body movements, hair stirring characters' hair (except for Shrek, of course, who is quite bald .
833;The attention to detail is simply amazing, and I can't help but wonder why this film didn't cost about fifty billion dollars to make based on what I saw.
834;of course, the incredible animation would all go for naught without great actors supplying the voices of the characters, and you would have to look long and hard to beat the cast of Shrek.
835;Myers and Murphy will keep you in stitches from start to finish.
836;I won't go into the whole plot of the story here, as I'm sure that information is pretty easy to find hereabouts, but I will say the story is incredibly witty and is truly the stuff that all.
837;time classic films are made of.
838;While it turns the world of fairy tales on its ear, it does come bearing some important morals, the most important of which is the advice to not judge a person by his/her appearance.
839;In terms of pure entertainment, you also get the complete extended dance party ending of the film, the means to jump directly to many of the funnier or more visually stunning scenes, music videos from Smashmouth and Baha Men, and a number of silly little games to play.
840;So I thought now is as good a time as any to do that.
841;In this way, 'the other' is part of our mythologizing, whose identity is constructed by the dominant story.
842;tale characters, are bought, sold, and rejected.
843;He is a white male with a Napolean complex .
844;This is part of a very important theme: Farquad is a pretend king.
845;Notice his control of the authentic.
846;His power and glory are a fabrication that is established by a play of fear and of prejudice.
847;Most noteworthy and more central is his ongoing struggle to establish the """"perfect kingdom"""" ."""
848;"and so he attempts to capture the ""happily ever after"" for himself."
849;"Yet this ""perfect"" kingdom ."
850;with no ambiguity and perfect conformity to his liking .
851;is really a utilization of social construction with which he manipulates his reality.
852;there is a general understanding among anthropologists that we interpret our world through story, allowing our expectations to be shaped by them.
853;She learns that along the way.
854;Every classic horror film where a beautiful woman is victimized by a gothic creature serves to a particular perspective of good and evil through a particular construction of women.
855;defining its power in terms of defeat and conquest, and restoration of a well.
856;Both Robin Hood and Farquad need to fit themselves in a defining narrative whereby it is easy to manipulate their identity.
857;The Robin Hood scene nicely upsets the imperial/patriarchical assumption of chivalry.
858;Princess Fiona proves to be stronger than Robin Hood, revealing his weakness and deconstructing his facade.
859;It's actually as if her day.
860;tale depiction of a fair.
861;The Shrek story effectively deconstructs the fairy.
862;What I come away with is a sense that to live by a pre.
863;"scriptive narrative, and to mediate one's identity through it, is to be fake, inauthentic, and to transcend
864;in summery, Shrek is a commentary on empire.
865;The power of empire is its story.
866;telling of a society, and manipulates it in order to type.
867;cast itself into the heroic and the salvific.
868;Cameron Diaz' second best film (after 'Something About Mary'), Mike Myers' best, and could it be that Eddie Murphy has finally found his calling as the voice of animal sidekicks?
869;All around, a solid, imaginative, and genuinely funny .
870;An outraged Shrek demands that Lord Farquaard remove the creatures.
871;so off goes Shrek, with his noble steed Donkey.
872;The princess is rescued and brought back to Lord Farqaard.
873;A clean and wholesome film for the whole family.
874;Me and my girlfriend watched this cause we had seen the trailers months before and had an inkling to see the movie.
875;First of all, i saw Monsters Inc and thought it was delightful and very well done.
876;I saw this movie twice in a 2 week period and am still impressed by the story this is a great movie destinmed to be a classic passed from generation to generation.
877;This ranks with the top Fairy Tales that I grew to know and love as a child.
878;The clever moments are few and far between in this Dreamworks computer animated tale.
879;One of the highlights of the film was when they had bits involving other fairy tale characters, particularly the Gingerbread Man interrogation.
880;It became the first film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film.
881;This film is terrific for all ages to watch.
882;The three characters find their true selves and reveal secrets that change their lives forever.
883;The action sequences contain the entertainment to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.
884;Some action scenes have a little humor, namely tributing to The Matrix .
885;As with the plot, the actors offer their own sense of theme that adds to the thrills.
886;The wide range of personalities keep audiences interested.
887;Shrek is great film sure to please audiences everywhere.
888;Fans should also watch Shrek 2 as the two combined make a great viewing experience.
889;First off let me say, that I think Shrek is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
890;It even lets you dub yourown voice into certain scenes from the movie in place of the actor.
891;I have never had so much fun, and I'm still finding more things to do.
892;Yes, this movie is as funny as it is brilliant, in every sense of the word.
893;If you have a movie PACKED with jokes that aren't meant for children, and which children couldn't possibly understand, how can you reach this conclusion?Anyways, the movie is great, and so are the actors.
894;Eddie Murphy does an amazing job as Donkey, and Mike Meyers is wonderful as Shrek.
895;The animation is amazing and packed with details.
896;shrek is one of the best animated movies that dreamworks did, it's funny, brilliant and charming.
897;this is a must see.
898;This movie is funny, graphically stunning and full of adventure and bellyache laughs!
899;Because I'm a believer too!
900;An entertaining film with a bit of a mean streak which I, for one, appreciated.
901;It's a lot of fun to watch the familiar characters in a new context.
902;There's plenty of action and an uplifting message for the kids, as well as more adult humor to keep grown.
903;The music is also used well, contributing to scenes (particularly at the beginning and end) that just made me feel happy.
904;just one question: in a film whose message is supposed to be that we should look beyond appearences to appreciate the person beneath, why is it still okay to make fun of the little guy?
905;An instant classic, a ton of funny lines and lovely character development.
906;Great animations and genius irony.
907;Not only is the tale entertaining but I think it carries a strong message as well.
908;the animation is very interesting and the new computer generated techniques make the characters look so real that it almost seems that they are actual actors slightly distorted by special effects.
909;Dreamworks Pictures' wonderful, whimsical Shrek proves to be the latest family film to live up to its billing.
910;With its blend of high adventure, light romance, and double.
911;In fact, this movie is so good that adults unaccompanied by offspring can venture into a theater without having to dress up in a disguise.
912;goers"
913;generated motion pictures, Shrek has once more raised the bar .
914;and this one was already at an impressively high level in the wake of Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur.
915;Yet Shrek outshines them both, boasting the most impressive detail and most amazingly rendered creatures of any motion picture in its class.
916;shrek is essentially Beauty and the Beast with a few clever twists.
917;Fans of those two stories will find much to like here.
918;"And, both kids and adults can play a game of ""guess how many famous faces we can see""."
919;There, he makes a deal with the noble .
920;But what he doesn't count on, and what Shrek doesn't expect, is that the beauty and the beast will develop feelings for each other.
921;as impressive as the visuals are .
922;and they are very impressive .
923;As this kind of animation becomes more prevalent, the importance of choosing the right voices will need equal care and attention.
924;action actors can do vocal performances.
925;Fortunately, Shrek has four capable actors.
926;First and foremost is Mike Myers, who is known as a vocal chameleon.
927;Eddie Murphy shows that a real comic genius can get laughs without relying on his own facial expressions and body language.
928;Murphy's Donkey is one of the funniest characters he has brought to the screen.
929;(Here, he improves upon what he did in Mulan.)
930;She believes in true love and Prince Charming, but, like her Charlie's Angels alter.
931;the interplay between Shrek and Princess Fiona is sweet and tender, while the exchanges between the ogre and the ass are often barbed and subversively funny.
932;"time co. directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (he has worked as a visual supervisor on other films, including the two Joel Schumacher Batmans
933;Shrek is easily one of the year's most magical experiences.
934;Children will adore it for the plot and the characters, as well as for the animation.
935;Adults will enjoy it for artistic and thematic merits, which are voiced by the finest drmatic and comedic actors of our time.
936;Mike Myers utilizes a portion of his comedic talents while verbalizing a nifty Gaelic accent to his character Shrek , as opposed to Myers' rather banal, square British dialect for his Austin Powers character.
937;Eddie Murphy's vocal stylings are, well, Eddie Murphy's.
938;His vocal characterizations, although somewhat overplayed and overreptitious here, add a spicy and unique comedic element all their own.
939;As far as the animated artwork is concerned, it is in a class all by itself, complete with its worldly, English countryside nuances and themes.
940;There's one small detail, though.
941;Upon the initial viewing of Shrek , one will easily notice this feature was filmed with great artistic vision and expression, thus containing an element many of the claymation features are missing (a la Chicken Run .
942;in discussing the entertainment value of Shrek , as was previously mentioned, both kids and adults will truly find various elements of this artistic jewel to appreciate.
943;Plus, the kids will come out of watching Shrek learning a valuable life lesson, which they'll have to see and hear for themselves.
944;But, to truly appreciate all the glorious wonder of Shrek , you'll just have to view it for yourself.
945;Mike Meyers is great as sort of a Scottish ogre, and Eddie Murphy is fantastic as an annoying donkey.
946;A lot of the humor was a bit off color too.
947;Now I enjoy toilet humor as much as the next guy, but I don't know if being in the same league as Beavis and Butthead is really where they should be aiming.
948;For example, Eddie Murphy played an annoying dragon in Mulan, but the movie as a whole had a better story and was more enjoyable.
949;Those were older movies, but still their animation held up and their stories were far superior in my opinion.
950;I am a widower, and thought this movie would be enjoyable"
951;I recommended it to everyone I know and they all enjoyed it, too.
952;I think the story is just so universally enjoyable it has to be an all time hit!
953;have watched it many times and I still crack up at that smart mouthed Donkey
954;Oh what a great movie this was.
955;This great movie is fun for the whole family.
956;And, if you practice this you may be losing out on a lot of awesome people, and wonderful opportunities.
957;Chances are good that just about anyone in the Western world will find something funny here.
958;cheek attitude of the movie itself and are certainly worth going through at least once, if for nothing else but the info on how the movie was made and other details.
959;also, unlike another movie, the outtakes are genuine technical goofs, rather than contrived screw.
960;"ups
961;I found myself laughing out loud.
962;The story, animation and acting talents are superb!
963;It was a great movie for all ages.
964;Share a musical with your family.
965;If you liked Shrek the movie, the whole family will like this Broadway version.
966;All characters soar in their performances.
967;Share, laugh, Share, and you'll watch it over and over again.
968;This movie was VERY funny!!!!!
969;I am sure this movie will have great write.
970;This is one of my favorite movies I have seen, and most of my friends like it too.
971;She can fight and we find out she is an ogre too.
972;I like a lot of kid's stories and alot of fairy tales, and this was fun for me to watch because I recognized some of the stories I read when I was younger like the gingerbread man and pinnochio.
973;it comes in two discs, one for widescreen lovers and the other for those who somehow just cant stand the black bars on the screen.
974;the extras on this film are excellent as is the whole formatting.
975;Go to the special features disk on either disk one or two and highlight main menu.
976;after you click on it Donkey will fly in the air and you'll see all the characters singing abunch of songs!
977;It also comes up if you watch past the credits on disc 2)3.
978;To see a small but still interesting DTS clip on Shrek Disc 2, simply set your player to play Title 11.4.
979;Shrek is an entertaining twist on the old princess fairy tales.
980;Some good messages about liking and caring about people for who they are as opposed to how they look.
981;Shrek is a delight for children of all ages.
982;It will make you laugh and bring a tear to your eye.
983;It is cleverly written and expertly performed.
984;It is sure to become a classic.
985;I've seen it 3 times and it always makes me smile.
986;I recommend it for people who want to smile.
987;I have two children and along with them I've watched this movie about 10 times in a week and still interested in making it part of my collection.
988;There's comedy, romance, drama etc.
989;Everyone should love this one.
990;And lots of things for adults to laugh at also.
991;I still think Shrek 3 is the best.
992;I think I enjoyed this movie more then my kids.
993;Funny, cleverly written with puns all though it.
994;I was even surprised at the end.
995;This movie was such fun!!
996;Great characters, lots of laughs and even a moral to the story!
997;This is a must see for the whole family!
998;Children and adults will love it!
999;This was one of the best animated films I have seen in a long time.
1000;Mike Myers does the voice of shrek brilliantly and I thought Eddie Murphy was excellent as donkey.
1001;The jokes are new and plentiful and the storyline is a work of art.
1002;Cameron Diaz does the voice of the lovely princess Fiona who Shrek, with a little help (and hindrance) from donkey, has to save in order to get rid of all the fairytale creatures that have moved into shrek's swamp.
1003;The sub characters are also brilliant, one of my favourite being the gingerbread man.
1004;Also, the kareoke piece at the end of the film (after the credits) was hilarious.
1005;Watch it"
1006;The music is great and it is hysterically funny.
1007;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are hilarious in this fairy tale for both kids and adults alike.
1008;Like Disney sometimes does, Dreamworks throws in some adult barbs the kids won't understand but they'll love it anyway and so will you.
1009;In the process he learns a lot about himself, friendship, and love.
1010;one of the few cartoons I'd watch again.
1011;Pros: Lots of fun, Mike Myers in his great Scottish accent (remember 'Hed .
1012;is great as Shrek and Eddie Murphy knocks some rust off his humor in a movie where he is neither Disney'ed down nor allowed to play more than one part.
1013;After great work as a stright.
1014;This movie had me laughing most of the way through it.
1015;She just loved the movie, so I got one for her as well as for myself.
1016;I say this is just about perfect for any child from 5 to 105.
1017;Shrek has it to surprise and to enjoy each and everyone of your family or even none of your relatives.
1018;it is easy to see with every kind of company.
1019;It's plenty of laugh and plenty of love.
1020;Music is really a big part of the film and every tune is perfect.
1021;animated even to make the adults captivated.
1022;deep and that ugliness could be a form of tender beauty.
1023;Savagely touching and poignant, it transcends the boundaries of a mediocre fairy tale to bring truth and learning to accept who you are.
1024;tale characters that all of us can relate to .
1025;from Pinochio to the Gingerbread man, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is a rambunctious parody and a wicked satire which has all the elements of a good fable .
1026;Myers does an admirable job of giving Shrek a likable personality, despite the toned.
1027;I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I'd like to see more animated movies done on this level, without descending into the dreadful mire of childish musicals for which American animation is best known.
1028;The shrek series is great to have for that rainy day when the grand kids come over.
1029;Shrek turns out to be funny and thought provoking.
1030;It really dissed Disney which made it even more hilarious.
1031;Mike Meyers and Eddy Murphy were excellent.
1032;My children and I highly recommend seeing this movie.
1033;this movie was just wonderful and both my sons have totaly enjoyed it and are still enjoying it.
1034;This is one of my favorite animated movies.
1035;This is a good, immensely viewable movie, both for children and adults, which is no mean feat.
1036;The overall result is that of a very well polished cartoon depicting a fairy tale story world with a modern twist.
1037;There are a lot of nods to other movies, including the that'll do phrase out of Babe .
1038;In fact Shrek is evolutionary only, if you want to have a revolutionary visual experience, see Final Fantasy , a contemporary photo realistic computer generated movie.
1039;On the other hand Shrek is a polished, clever, entertaining piece of work and will probably become a classic.
1040;It is a great movie for the whole family!
1041;Shrek is a very funny yet touching movie.
1042;It is definitely one of the best this summer.
1043;hearted movie, this is the one to see.
1044;one of those fun animations that is enjoyable by both adult and child.
1045;sit down relax and enjoy this as well as a good parfait and you're well on your way to recovery.
1046;Shrek surpassed Pixar's previous movies and today, it is already a much.
1047;"Not only that , their movies have had the fun and welcoming atmosphere to appeal to younger audiences yet also have enough sophistication and dialog to win over the adult audience and ""Shrek"" is one of the shining examples of such movies."
1048;the story begins with a huge solitary Ogre named Shrek who has enjoyed most of his life in peace alone on his swamp/home.
1049;But from there, the so called fairytale is completely warped into a comedic adventure full of fun, laughs, and excellent storylines.
1050;"But not only those make this movie great, it also has a highly important message about what true love really is about that personality is far more important than physical appearance and I tell you, it is for this reason taht ""Shrek"" is in fact, not only a great and fun movie, but also an important must."
1051;It's absolutely worth every rusted penny!
1052;I now have all 4 of the Shrek movies.
1053;They are a joy for me and my children alike.
1054;I'll come right out and say it: Shrek is one of the best movies of the year, a nonstop laugh riot with a morality lesson and extremely likeable characters in tow.
1055;In fact, this highly unconventional fairy tale boasts so many winning voices performances and completely riotous humor that it's impossible not to be dazzled by its irresistible charm and tenacious wit.
1056;perhaps the most winning aspect of this delight is its successful ability to turn the clich d fairy tale into a fresh and inviting premise, where nothing is what we have come to believe it should be.
1057;Poking fun at the Disney franchise, the plot surrounds a lonely ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), who lives in solitude not so much because he wants to, but because he feels his physical appearance is appalling to others.
1058;and just as Shrek is characterized out of the ordinary, so is Princess Fiona, who becomes a witty, easily irritable kung.
1059;This new spin on the damsel in distress is frequently funny, showcased most notably in a scene in which a French Robin Hood attempts to win her heart, only to feel the heel of her boot (add this scene to the list of ongoing Matrix spoofs).
1060;these characters are some of the best of their kind, completely animated yet easy to get a feel for.
1061;The combined talents of Myers, Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow all combust to make these characters more convincing and humorous than most others of the genre.
1062;the layout of the film's script is amazing, a work of comedic art that transcends all comedy genres to become a good.
1063;The constant ramblings of Eddie Murphy will no doubt please kids and adults alike, while the various spoofs of fairy tales will induce fits of laughter.
1064;A few instances of toilet humor make this animated feature somewhat ambitious, but it knows its limits and complies with them.
1065;the film's morality lesson about the judgmental society is also one of its strong points.
1066;Shrek is seen as monstrous by various characters, though his winning charm and sense of humor provide the age.
1067;old lesson that it's what's inside a person that truly counts.
1068;The secret behind Princess Fiona also helps to advance this point, and by the film's end, it has succeeded in making that point splendidly.
1069;The film is a wondrous spectacle of animation, well.
1070;liked characters, and some of the most enlightening humor of any movie this year.
1071;It's ability to turn our vision of a fairy tale completely upside down is a rousing success, as is virtually everything else about this enormously entertaining treat.
1072;great movie a lot funny.
1073;The wonder and innovative rejumbling of fairy tale characters makes this an utterly delightful film.
1074;The big bad Ogre is a good guy and the princess is under a spell with an unusual twist.
1075;Her freedom, and transformation scene is clever.
1076;"Much like, ""ANTZ"", and ""A BUG'S LIFE."""
1077;In a monumental leap since the above average Prince of Egypt, Dreamworks unleashed Shrek .
1078;filled fantasy/adventure whose hero is, well, a little unorthodox.
1079;Along the way, they manage to have a lot of fun with the traditional nursery rhymes and bedtime stories that most of us heard when we were children.
1080;Rather, it is a cleverly designed tale which engages the minds of adults while tickling the visual senses of the younger generations.
1081;(The Gingerbread Man/Muffin Man scene alone makes this movie worth watching).
1082;The menus are incredibly interactive, and even entertaining.
1083;The several features about the making of Shrek are definitely worth watching, and the karaoke video (which appeared after the credits in the theatrical release) is available for viewing by itself.
1084;This is one of those movies which you can't stop watching or hoping will end in the way it does.
1085;Great for kids and adults who are in love.
1086;The best feel good movie I have seen in a long time.
1087;The ending even made my eyes moist with tears.
1088;"review:Great story with a solid script with good cohesion, flow and development
1089;And, a wonderful Filmakers' Commentary.
1090;mike Meyers shows himself to be a gifted comedian with lots of wonderfully creative ideas and a moral to tell in the end.
1091;Princess Fiona is obsessed with having """"loves first kiss"""" with her """"true love"""", and of course, cannot wait to be with her great Lord Farquaad whom she supposes is her true love."""
1092;moral:There may be much more to people than meets the eye!
1093;Shrek is a fast paced, funny, thrilling, emotional, roller coaster ride that will make you laugh, cry, and worry about the characters as they face a love sick dragon, a rather short dictator, and try to live in a world where fairytail creatures are being banned from their homes.
1094;He must open his heart, and his home to those who grow to like him.
1095;The donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is Shrek's likeable and laughable sidekick on the trek.
1096;With a series of quirky adventures, Shrek finds himself facing something that an ogre has never faced before.
1097;It is a good family film, one that everyone can sit down, watch, and enjoy.
1098;but I went with my family and we all enjoyed it tremendously.
1099;"Those with a very delicate temprament, allergic to bathroom humor, should probably stay at home, and people of less than average stature might be offended at one of the characterisations
1100;The story is clever, with a plot twist at the end that your kids will be proud they figured out ahead of time.
1101;The snappy dialogue is full of laughs, but with some important points to make, too"
1102;Mike Myers is actually subdued in the title role.
1103;Eddie Murphy steals the show as Donkey, Shrek's sidekick, essentially reprising his role as the dragon in Mulan.
1104;The animation is truly wonderful, but Final Fantasy really steals Shrek's thunder as the animation miracle of the summer of 2001.
1105;I loved 'Shrek' from the first time I saw it at the theater, and left thinking, 'that soundtrack was great.'
1106;I especially liked the track, 'Halleluiah' by Leonard Cohen.
1107;From the opening minute to the closing credits, this film is a delight .
1108;And that is why I consider it a perfect film.
1109;From beginning to end you will be thoroughly entertained.
1110;i love Mike Myers' voice as Shrek, and the animation gives him a real heart.
1111;Eddie Murphy as Donkey is superb.
1112;I guess Eddie might not appreciate this, but Shrek is a high point in his career.
1113;His constant prattle is hilarious.
1114;I still laugh outloud at his lines, and 10+ times later, I still cry when he meets Dragon at the stream.
1115;still seem very fresh to me.
1116;It's a very clever script, beautifully animated, beautifully execited.
1117;there's a sweet message in Shrek, and it touches the heart.
1118;it richly deserved the 2002 Oscar for 'Best Animated Film'.
1119;I just wonder, wasn't it the best film of 2002?
1120;This movie has many funny moments and some great references to other childhood classics and fairy tales.
1121;above 8 years old it is a good movie.
1122;year old son loved it.
1123;Shrek offers stunning animation, interesting characters, engaging voices, a classic storyline, even a noble moral to the story.
1124;based humor is desirable in a movie directed at children, nor was it necessary for this story.
1125;shrek gets a 4 .
1126;If one were to imagine a happy ending where 'Belle' from 'BEAUTY and THE BEAST' became a beast in the end rather than the beast becoming a Prince, one can get an idea of what Shrek is all about.
1127;"as with ""Ice Age,"" I found myself watching and re."
1128;watching this new, animated epic which has quickly become a favorite of our family .
1129;Part of what makes this film so good is the way it lampoons the usual cliches.
1130;"In Shrek, the ending is satisfying, although it would be much like ""Beauty and the Beast"" ending with Belle becoming a beast too (courtesy of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the K is Dreamworks SKG)!"
1131;SHREK is a real winner.
1132;This is one of the most innovative concepts to come out of Hollywood in some time.
1133;It's a production that combines animation with subtle adult humor.
1134;It parodies fairy tales, martial arts movies makes fun of traditional constitutions of behavoir.
1135;Somehow, it manages to not offend.
1136;the special effects and animation on this movie are absolutely stunning.
1137;They certainly pulled out all the stops.
1138;Visually speaking, this work is nothing short of spectacular.
1139;the talent pool displayed is also very impressive.
1140;Mike Myers is great as Shrek, Cameron Diaz is wonderful as the frustrated damsel.
1141;Eddie Murphy is a stupendous choice as the comic.
1142;here is a family friendly movie complete with some border.
1143;Shrek was like cotton candy.
1144;A fun film for children over 6 (some scary scenes including Mama Bear .
1145;Eddie Murphy turns in a delightful performance.
1146;John Lithgow steals the movie when he can.
1147;but I decided to give Shrek a whirl.
1148;I was so pleasantly surprised.
1149;Here's a quick rundown of what I loved about Shrek * Incredible graphics!
1150;I am a designer and I greatly appreciated the amazing attention to detail.
1151;The comic bits were really funny.
1152;* The characters were excellent.
1153;* It was a very, very sweet story.
1154;It had a hilarious story line with the combination of all your favorite fairy tales with the new fairy tale princess and her ogre knight in shining armor .
1155;The computer animations used to make this movie was one of the best I've ever seen (with the exception of Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within).
1156;I went to go see it, and it turned out to be a perfect combination of wonderful animation, terrific vioce.
1157;overs, comic brilliance, and a creative story.
1158;while the film offers animation that puts everything from Pixar to shame, the thing that shines through the most in this production is the cast, most notably Eddie Murphy as Donkey.
1159;Mike Myers was hilarious as Shrek, but the accent couldn't make me stop picturing his Fat .
1160;One of our Grandsons favorite movies.
1161;Love to watch him view it and see how excited he gets at the dragon part.
1162;This movie has so much heart and feeling, I never would have expected anything close to this.
1163;This is such a clever movie, even after seeing it so much, there is always something else to see.
1164;Shrek is absolutely hillarious .
1165;romance, fighting, humor and comedy .
1166;and it's something the whole family can watch together.
1167;And of course, the movie includes an important message for kids and adults alike.
1168;Great for young and old, original, funny, and just a greatanimated movie!
1169;Watch it, you'll love it too!
1170;Move over Disney because here comes Shrek!
1171;This was one of the best animated films that I had seen since Disney last great, The Lion King.
1172;Don't get me wrong there have been others as well (like TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2), but Shrek really stands apart from them all because, it's funny, witty and a great movie all together.
1173;It's a movie that'll make you laugh and your kids laugh too.
1174;this is a great film!
1175;It's very funny and a great story along with excellent animation and the comedy of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy will keep you laughing for hours.
1176;A perfect movie for anyone.
1177;shrek is the sweetest and most entertaining kids' movie I have ever seen!
1178;It ranks right up there with Toy Story on the adults.
1179;The story is great, pulling from many children's storybook characters, and delving into social issues through the simple story of good versus the not.
1180;I'll give a short list of the good and the bad (as I think the movie is great, but could have been even better):The good:1) The animation and artwork is phenomenal.2) The story is fun, interesting, and even surprising.3) The characters are well developed, and the voices are great.4) There is a message of good intentions.
1181;I say this with all good intentions.
1182;Anyone can enjoy this movie, but I can't help but wonder how good it could have been if focused on one specific audience.2) The green ogre versus the short little bad guy is misguided.
1183;It proves that the writer and director have little ability to recognize their own prejudices.
1184;I think Shrek was one of the most enjoyable movies to come out last year.
1185;If you're going to spend this kind of time making a movie, make it a masterpiece.
1186;donkey asks to stay with Shrek and after much resistance he agrees.
1187;shrek is a great animated film but I was expecting more then what I saw.
1188;some parts dragged and I found dull but I do recommend this film to anyone.
1189;the voice talents were amazing.
1190;shrek won an Oscar for best animated picture in 2002 and it does deserve it.
1191;see this animated hit Shrek.
1192;Great movie for anybody 2 see.
1193;If there were ever a movie to see and to own, Shrek was it.
1194;Okay, maybe it's not the only one, but it's definitely worth having.
1195;The movie has got to be one of the funniest, smartest satyres to be produced in the last 100 years.
1196;With Shrek, you get to take everything you thought you knew about fairy tales and see them from the other side.
1197;The movie puts fairy tale living in a new light and challenges the viewer to see things through childlike eyes.
1198;One of the best things about this movie is that it's great for kids and adults.
1199;Kids will love the general story and the animation.
1200;Adults will love the underlying messages and humor as well as the animation.
1201;I had wanted to see it because I have always loved animation, and it had a unique story and main character, SHREK.
1202;I thought the laughs were few and far between myself.
1203;Shrek was not bad at all, it was cute, and it had a great message in the end that was very endearing.
1204;okay, this was very funny.
1205;but true hiliarous films have you constantly laughing.
1206;And the ending was very funny.
1207;Probably one of the best animated films I have ever seen.
1208;This movie is definitely up there with The Lion King!
1209;I insist you watch it.
1210;And what I like best is that it pleases everyone!
1211;There's even a moral or two at the end for the littluns.
1212;this is a great family movie.
1213;With three sarcastic characters, a laughable antagonist, and a hilarious plot with a twist you won't see coming, Shrek has got the goods to please anyone between the ages of seven to seventy!
1214;Shrek is a neatly packaged fable, great fun for the whole family (unless you're squeamish about muted potty humor).
1215;technical marvels don't make a great movie, however.
1216;Fortunately, Shrek has plenty of soul.
1217;Myers Murphy play well off each other, bringing to life a fable about love, integrity, and acceptance.
1218;hard to imagine a more enjoyable picture.
1219;(If you'd like to dialogue more about this review or movie, please click on the about me link above and drop me an email.
1220;it's definitely worth a view.
1221;I watched this movie with my husband and we both really liked it.
1222;movie fan so I especially liked it because it was unusual and funny, but still a nice fairy tale and very well drawn and animated.
1223;The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience.
1224;Lord Farquar for example is maddenly realistic and yet not at all realistic.
1225;Anyone who has seen this movie can't help but be charmed by it.
1226;It's charming, funny, and filled with many positive messages.
1227;This is a great modern fairy tale.
1228;Shrek the Ogre with plenty of attitude was perfectly done by Mike Myers.
1229;And Cameron Diaz did a decent job with voicing Princess Fiona.
1230;A true keeper in the kid's movie collection.
1231;Still, it's fun to see the so called outtakes and the info on how they made the movie.
1232;The Gingerbread Man is your guide through a lot of the options, and his little statements are funny!I absolutely love how this movie takes shots at the giants of the family entertainment industry.
1233;My favorite part of this entire movie is the smackdown at the end between Belle and Snow White.
1234;The animation is great and fun, and the features will keep you busy and will spoil you!
1235;the movie's also terrific in that it does work at both the adult and child levels.
1236;The kids will like seeing some of their favorite fantasy characters in another context.
1237;While they may have less than pleasant personalities in this movie, I don't think that's going to emotionally scar our nation's youth, and the adults can enjoy the many zingers that get thrown in.
1238;but the familiar characters take a back seat to the brand new creations of this story.
1239;Eddie Murphy as the donkey is great, if standard sidekick material.
1240;But the animation of the Shrek character is more enjoyable with each viewing.
1241;How Shrek brushes his teeth, catches fish for dinner, and provides a candle to light his dinner table are done so well they may become the new way of polite society.
1242;But I think the Shrek character has a lot of potential for a string of movies.
1243;I anxiously await the next one.
1244;I watched Shrek with my 3 year old sone when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it tremendously.
1245;it is a masterpiece worth having in your video library even if you do not have kids.
1246;the story about the unfriendly ogre in search and defence of his privacy is very cute.
1247;home from the invasion of the fairy tales creatures, Shrek goes on a quest to save a princess.
1248;He meets a talking donkey who decides that Shrek would be his friend.
1249;The journey is quite funny and the happy ending quite unconventional.
1250;there are several things that make this movie superb entertainment:1.
1251;It is movie for kids and adults alike.
1252;The fairy tale story line is fun for the kids.
1253;The various puns, allegories and jokes are fun for the adults.
1254;On the contrary, it makes fun of features like that.2.
1255;detailed, bright and realistic (as realistic as an ogre can be)3.
1256;The voices of the actors are excellent.
1257;Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphie and Cameron Diaz do a great job giving the characters a life of their own.
1258;A great movie for everyone, very funny and a clever story!
1259;One that everyone should see!
1260;Great for the kids and adults.
1261;Changes you mood pretty quickly.
1262;Great movie, my 3 year old loves it.
1263;Simply put, 'Shrek' is an *amazing* movie.
1264;It has wit, humor, heart, intergrity, morales, lessons, positive messages, etc. 'Shrek' is a very unique comedy as it is enjoyable to both young and old.
1265;Kids get a fun and cute warped fairy tale, while adults get a deeper meaning about acceptance of one another.
1266;The humor 'Shrek' is just fantastic!
1267;'Shrek' mocks Disney movies, The Matrix, Riverdance, and more!
1268;The mocking isn't malicious, just cute and *hilarious*!
1269;Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and Eddie Murphy are amazing!
1270;Their voices really bring their special characters alive.
1271;The soundtrack is upbeat and fun with a few songs by Smash Mouth.
1272;The 'Shrek' soundtrack is defintely a personal favorite of mine.
1273;iMO, Monsters Inc. did a much better job with the genre and was funnier and much more original.
1274;Loved the music and the humor.
1275;Story line was simple and sweet.
1276;Would recommend to friends and family.
1277;Shrek is nice little story.
1278;I think the voice actor choices are excellent.
1279;Now I liked the Shrek character and seeing all those from the fairy tales.
1280;although it's not for young kids, it's watchable.
1281;I watch it all the time.
1282;And I hsve all the movies now.
1283;This is an extremely funny movie.
1284;Other than that it is a hilarious movie with a wonderful cast.
1285;How much better can you get?
1286;My 18 month old son loves Shrek.
1287;He loves movies with music and Shrek does not disappoint.
1288;Great choices of music and actors to play the cast of characters.
1289;Great jokes for all ages in this movie which is nice because you get to enjoy the movie as an adult and your children can enjoy it as well.
1290;This movie also was the first animated movie to win an oscar for best animated feature so you know it is worth downloading.
1291;hard Disney fan and yet I absolutely loved how this movie poked fun at some of the best Disney classics.
1292;This is a fabulous movie.
1293;I bought it used and it works just fine!
1294;The animation is hillarious, the characters are so real, each detail of the environment, character and mood is precise.
1295;Also it's very very funny.
1296;I can watch that movie ten times in a row.
1297;Wife loves to watch movie alot.
1298;The personality of each character is just amazing and the humor is not superficial.
1299;Even the little tributes to other movies are original and surprising funny.
1300;I hate this movie with a passion.
1301;music hits, and garnish with a monstrous amount of potty humor, and there you go.
1302;all of which incite powerful emotions and teach important lessons a child can actually learn from.
1303;For those of us who grew up in the 70s, 80s and 90s and can remember them, this is an excellent movie.
1304;The move is filled with allusions, and nuances that make you remember your childhood.
1305;Shrek would be the latter.
1306;If you're a fan of animated movies, this is definately worth checking out.
1307;Funny, very well done in all aspects, and as far as I'm concerned, safe for the kids.
1308;I highly recommend even if you aren't all that crazy about animated films.
1309;This one is one of the best ever made, for sure!
1310;Shrek goes on a quest to save Princess Fiona (voiced by Camron Diaz).
1311;Accompanied by Shrek is a donkey voiced by the extremely funny Eddie Murphy.
1312;This is a great movie for any age that will be watched over and over and provide a lot of laughs.
1313;Shrek is a cute movie, it's not as cute or as charming as Monster's Inc or Finding Nemo but it's quite good and as some funny moments.
1314;Shrek looked like a bad guy but in his heart he is so sweet.
1315;He helps many fairy tale characters to find their freedom but at the end he find his happiness.
1316;This movie its very nice and funny.
1317;My little girl loves Shrek.
1318;The movie is so funny!
1319;My kids and I just love it.
1320;The adult comedy in it really makes it fun.
1321;eddy Murphy was actually the funniest and better voice over.
1322;Secondly, when Shrek blows into a frog's mouth, inflating it into a balloon.
1323;The animation effects are outstanding though!
1324;I think I enjoyed them more than the movie!
1325;This ia great movie, and fun for all ages!
1326;My niece, less than 2 years, loves the music and seeing the lumbering Shrek.
1327;There is lots more to add, just wanted to stress the re.
1328;i ordered it so when my grandkids come we have a funny movie to watch .
1329;I am a big fan on computer animations films, such as Toy Story 1 and 2, and I thought it would be hard to beat them.
1330;the graphics are great, all the background details including the sunflowers, Shrek's house, the castles and other fields are greatly depicted.
1331;the dialogs are funny and eventough Shrek would be considered at first sight like an anti.
1332;specially by not including those boring songs in the middle of the scenes and definetly it is a movie for Children and Adults to watch and laugh together.
1333;The music selected throughout the movie, with a few exceptions, was brilliant and moving and was appropriate for the scenes.
1334;The music used at the end of the dragon chase was excellent.
1335;The movie's theme of not judging a book by its cover, and the aspect of falling in true love, and the meaning of true friendship, are strong themes throughout the movie.
1336;animated films to do as well.
1337;ride on certain music selections will turn this movie from a four star status into a five star movie.
1338;Dear Reader, Shrek is sometimes gross good for the whole family, kind of movie.
1339;Funny almost all the time, and a great cast that brings good voices to the humorous characters.
1340;Distributed by Dreamworks, who brought othe great animations like Prince of Egypt, and Antz.
1341;This movie gaining $250 million+ which is wonderful, this kind of gross would of been good for Titanic and any of the Star Wars (But they got more all of those films got like $350 million+ which is wonderful for them).
1342;i went to this film with a little girl, i believe her age is 5, she loved it and i loved it, exactly i think i loved it more than her.
1343;This movie has more humor for adults than for children, which i didn't expect.
1344;Recommend for anyone looking for a good and funny time.
1345;A very charming funny portrayal .
1346;both a spoof of fairy tales and a fairy tale in itself.
1347;there where some particularly memorable moments and this together with the great humour ,animation,acting and music is what makes it great , and provides so much originality that the simple plot doesn't matter in the least.
1348;all the characters where great .
1349;i loved the subplot of the romance between the donkey and the girl.
1350;i thought the dragon was a particularly delightful, character though she didn't actually talk.
1351;the music at the end was also delightful ,with the Who's Who of Fairy Tales participating in the singing and dancing at the end to some well known pop hits .
1352;"The classic fable ""never judge a book by its cover."""
1353;A good lesson for people of all ages.
1354;There is both humor along with the moral though and it is very funny however there are a few references that you will be thankful that your kids don't understand.
1355;This is a great one for Mike Myers and it is also the best Eddie Murphey movie in a long while.
1356;On the one hand, Shrek is indeed funny, and chock.
1357;Eddie Murphy as the Donkey is especially entertaining, although the entire cast is strong as well.
1358;princess plotline with an unconventional antihero and non.
1359;traditional heroine, the moral .
1360;Some of the humor may push the PG envelope a bit, but Shrek is one of the most warm.
1361;hearted and genuinely funny animated movies to emerge in a LONG time.
1362;It's offbeat and very winning, with superb voice acting by Myers, Diaz, Lithgow and especially Eddie Murphy, whose donkey almost steals the movie, and in THIS company, that's a major compliment.
1363;This is one of those very rare movies that can appeal to just about all age levels.
1364;Obviously, kids will love it because it is a cartoon, and extremely funny (that's why this adult loves it to!)
1365;"But there is more to this movie
1366;Our family ages from 2 to 50, and all love this movie.
1367;Its great for kids and adults alike.
1368;I recommend it to anyone.
1369;other than that, I thought that it was a great movie and had a good message.
1370;there he is talked into rescuing the lovely princess from the dragon.
1371;to rid his home of the fair tale critters he takes the job.
1372;On a final note if you listen too the music and songs they help tell the story very nicely and move it along.
1373;the piece Hallelhujah captures the entire story.
1374;here is another spot Dream works takes yet another crack at Disney:With the new and improved version of It's a Small World (lol).
1375;This light hearted tale will please both children and adults.
1376;Eddie Murohy's humor is funny without being overly crude.
1377;This is one of the funniest movie I have ever seen.
1378;The comedy just keeps comeing!
1379;The donkey comes with him and proves to be a big help.
1380;It's the kind of movie that 3 generations call all watch together and all love.
1381;Funny, heart warming, good story line.
1382;Shrek was an enjoyable fantasy adventure that will appeal to adults as well as children.
1383;i watched it with my nephew and enjoyed it more than he did.
1384;it was very funny and very well animated.
1385;There are games to play, documentaries on how the movie was made and a nice sing a long karoke feature.
1386;Shrek is well done as cartoons go, one of the best.
1387;This was a TRUE love story.
1388;Shrek is an absolute must.
1389;see for children that will give them a good upstanding idea how this world should really be about people may they be ugly or gorgeous all people should be treated and loved the same.
1390;definitely should be a contender for Oscar as best picture.
1391;A fun, predictable love story with a twist of an ending.
1392;Shrek is a hilariously funny love story that would be enjoyed by anyone age 1 to 100.
1393;like animation for the children, and wild humor for adults.
1394;Known for their riotously funny and naughty humor, it's incredible how Mike Myers, star of Austin Powers and Eddie Murphy, star of 48 hours pulled off a movie for kids.
1395;Murphy really delivers the donkey character.
1396;i laughed through the whole movie.
1397;I'm not one to watch a movie over and over again, but each time the kids wanted to see it again, I was right there with them holding my side from the laughter.
1398;Tagging along side of him is the sweet but chattery donkey.
1399;The game and music video is a must see.
1400;For those looking for morality, it sends a wonderful message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that God has a special someone for everybody.
1401;A spin on Disney princess tales.
1402;This movie is one of the best animated hits in history.
1403;Productions such as this one are tailor.
1404;made for the Digital Theater System sound and the widescreen format .
1405;It is great for both kids and adults.
1406;In my opinion, Eddie Murphy steals the show as the heart.
1407;He finds just that when the lovely Princess Fiona comes into his life.
1408;The two of them have many ups and downs, but in the end, their love for each other and their understanding of one another's pasts brings them together for life.
1409;it's got sensitivity, humor, action, adventure, and so much more.
1410;I grumbled about going to see this movie, but I took my goddaughter and had more fun than she did I think!
1411;There is a great moral ending to this movie especially in a society today when everyone has to be size 6 and perfect.
1412;It was just an all around good family movie.
1413;Dreamworks Shrek is one of the best technical by then in quite some timeShrek was not just a box office hit, but it was a hit among childrens and fans of all ages.
1414;Shrek's success lay on Dreamworks success formula of mixing in all their previous characters that audiences loved, along with making a great adventure that had audiences entertained.
1415;the movie Shrek also had a great number of musical songs used in the movie such as Smashmouth's ''All Star'', Willie Nelson's ''On The Road Again'', ''The Pina Colada Song'' by Robert Holmes.
1416;farquaad in a funny scenes tries to capture the big, loving orge, Shrek outside his kingdom of Duloc, but Shrek defeats the men in a hilarious display including a spoof of wrestling.
1417;the wrestling spoof done by Shrek is absolute hilarious is no doubt a shot at Pro Wrestling at it's best.
1418;fiona is the beautiful princess who is somewhat chained to Lord Farquaadbut who dreams of being rescued by a great knignt of course that's whenShrek comes in.
1419;the ending was a bit of a surprise but it was a welcome surprise, in factcompared to that garbage of a movie called ''Shallow Hal'' , ''Shrek'' actuallydoes live up to theme of the inner beauty within someone to find love.
1420;Good humor for kids, as long as you appreciate a little low brow.
1421;Also fun for the grown ups, and the music is good.
1422;I've always thought so, and I stand behind that.
1423;But Mike Myers is wonderful, Eddie Murphy is a delight, and my 13.
1424;Eddie Murphy is hilarious in this movie.
1425;The animation is a little wooden compared to some later movies, but it's still a fun ride.
1426;well, the movie itself is awesome.
1427;The picture is great, and the sound even better.
1428;This is perhaps one of the best movies ever written.
1429;It follows Shrek and a donkey as they try and rescue a princess so that the King can marry her.
1430;This movie is funny and entertaining from beginning to end.
1431;I especially liked the soundtrack.
1432;The over all message of the film is excellent.
1433;It also focuses on letting your self become vulnerable to others but shows that vulnerability is a key to developing a deeper relationship.
1434;I noticed all the great reviews and the fantastic trailer and the idea of spoofing all the Disney movies if fabulous.
1435;less a very good watch with fantastically developed characters and a storyline that actually works.
1436;Still, Shrek is clever animated entertainment with good adult humour and children will enjoy it too.
1437;Although I still remember pretty much all of the jokes in the movie, I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.
1438;SHREK is one of those rare animated films that really DOES have something for all ages, be it slapstick humor to a rather satiric look at fairy tales and how commercialism has made them too cutesy in today's PC age.
1439;dressing wolf, among other fairy.
1440;Mike Myers is solid as the Scots.
1441;Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow also add solid characters with their voice work.
1442;This film is a MUST see and I highly recommend it.
1443;It is one of my favorite movies ever!
1444;NEVER A DULL MOMENT:As with """"Ice Age,"""" I found myself watching and re."""
1445;watching this new, animated epic which has quickly become a favorite of our family .
1446;Part of what makes this film so good is the way it lampoons the usual cliches.
1447;"In Shrek, the ending is satisfying, although it would be much like ""Beauty and the Beast"" ending with Belle becoming a beast too (courtesy of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the K is Dreamworks SKG)!"
1448;In short, this film is a real winner.
1449;this is one of the FEW children's movies that held his attentionWOW!!
1450;This is a beautifully executed 3.
1451;The humor offers something for all ages.
1452;oriented humor keeps the kiddies giggling all the way through the film, too.
1453;We had to see it again, and caught even more sly and clever gags the second time around.
1454;For those of you interested in digital animation, this is a feast for your eyes.
1455;Being much more than pure eye.
1456;candy , the wit and wisdom of this ultra.
1457;modern forum for presenting a classic fairytale takes you on a wonderful adventure.
1458;You will laugh again, and again at this witty and beautiful movie.
1459;There are several extra features packed onto the 2 disc set, enough to keep children AND adults entertained long after the movie has ended.
1460;Lots of action and a great ending.
1461;I loved it from beggining to the end.
1462;I am so very thankful to my beloved for taking me to see this movie!Great for the whole family, but I think children over 10 will understand the humor much better.
1463;this is an awesome movie with lots of laughs.
1464;it's great because they don't swear in it, but they do fit in inside jokes for the older kids in your family.
1465;year old can enjoy this movie together!
1466;This is a really good movie for kids and adults.
1467;I thought it was really great that they didn't make it those movies where the people don't have to be good looking like other movies.
1468;It has a nice turn at the end of the movie that suprises me.
1469;It is a whole new twist of a fairy tale.
1470;(voice by Eddie Murphy DR. dOLITTLE 2) He was a funny character with really funny lines.
1471;She is like a karate queen!
1472;She has a big secret she can't tell anyone because it embarreses her.
1473;Then he meets up with Donkey, and soon they develop a friendship.
1474;Then as the story goes on it gets better and better.
1475;I definetly recommend this movie to all ages
1476;This movie just lifts your spirits with its dry humor.
1477;William Steig did a delightful job at depicting a fairy.
1478;tale world that we have known for ages.
1479;So to his immense disliking fairy.
1480;tale creatures captured by Lord Farquaa have flocked his whole swamp.
1481;(I found that totally hilirous!!
1482;As Shrek leads Princess Fiona back toward Farquaad's castle, adventure begin, which does introduce a blossoming romance of sorts!
1483;THe fun packed adventure will truly delight whole families!
1484;Family movie, animation, fairytale kind figures, a bit of romance.
1485;This movie is all but Disney.
1486;sure there is romance in this story, but it is spinkled with good humor.
1487;It could be a fairy tale yes, but it is a fun fairy tale.
1488;up of 90 this movie brings happiness into everybody's life.
1489;The donkey rides along with Shrek because Shrek saved the donkey's life.
1490;one thing is for sure, the characters in this movie are all very well played by the actors both animated and voice of the real actor.
1491;knowing that DreamWorks likes to toy whit its rival I was curious how the disney .
1492;They ended very well and in a very, very comic way.
1493;"I loved everything about it
1494;This video was a true pleasure to view.
1495;Very good computer graphics went into the production of this feature!
1496;Kudos to all those involved!
1497;Let me tell ya, this movie was so good I thought that it was a Disney movie.
1498;I would recommend this movie for kids who are at least ten years old and any adult.
1499;Mike Myers was perfect as Shrek.
1500;John Lithgow was good as Lord Farquaad.
1501;The muffin man scene was hilarious.
1502;I hope that it wins some awards too.
1503;Love the first two in this series, but the music in this one was top notch!
1504;This movie had enough love to make boys' skin crawl, enjoy fighting to make girls' turn their head and enough to make adults fall out of their chair.
1505;My son loves Shrek, the only movie we do not have is Shrek 3 which I'm sure Santa will be bringing for Christmas.
1506;I even find myself excited to watch these movies.
1507;i saw this movie in the theatre with a group of friends and it was hilarious!
1508;The jokes are wonderful it maked fun of everything Disney!
1509;One of the best movies of the year!
1510;SHREK has some appealing moments.
1511;It also has some nice things to say about how society focuses too much on external beauty and not enough about a person's soul.
1512;Believe it or not but this is a movie everyone will love.
1513;It's got some slight innuendos only adults might catch and funny moment kids will love.
1514;I highly recommend this video in everyone's collection.
1515;This movie was a movie you and your family would enjoy.
1516;itis a mixture of all of you favorite disney movies mixedtogeather in one grate heroic tale.
1517;This movie is very well done.
1518;It's hysterically funny, the animation is wonderful and you don't get bored for a minute.
1519;In this visually awesome movie, we visit the Fairy Tale world of Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey (played brilliantly by Eddie Murphy), and the diminutive Lord Farquad.
1520;obsession that people claimed to have was simply due to the superb graphics.
1521;i WAS WRONG!This movie is wonderfully witty and absolutely, 100% entertaining.
1522;I've got an 8 BALL for that, thanks.
1523;This is the movie that made me enthusiastic about computer animation.
1524;I think this movie is good for just about everyone.
1525;i liked the story, I liked the characters, I liked the cultural references, I liked the jokes.
1526;Much of it seemed to be funny without even trying!
1527;Most of the movies I own are dramas, or psychological movies, or science fiction, and I love them.
1528;It is just really hard to find a good comedy.
1529;And Shrek is a good comedy!Back to my first comment, I was especially impressed by the animation.
1530;(If I could have any career I wanted, working on movies like this would be my dream job.)
1531;The attention to detail was amazing.
1532;I love the three sequels and give them all 5 stars as well.
1533;A funny movie that kids and adults both will enjoyed.
1534;Its one of the best family movies.
1535;It's worth it, plus I got to see him light up.
1536;One of my most favorite movies.
1537;Shrek is packed full of gross out humor and voice talents of Cameron diaz, Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and John Lithgow.
1538;The movie was well thought out and splendidly animated.
1539;Even though Shrek 2 was better, this movie had some great spoofs and a funny rendition of the Monkee's classic: 'I'm a believer' Smash Mouth doesn't do a bad job.
1540;The karaoke at the end is hilarious.
1541;Eddie Murphy as Donkey steals this show.
1542;favorite line:Donkey: So where's this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?Shrek: Inside, waiting for us to rescue herDonkey: I was talking about the dragon, ShrekA lot of the jokes young children may not get, but they'll enjoy the music and the characters.
1543;this movie will be funny for years to come.
1544;I look forward to watching it with my kids when they get older.
1545;There are sooo many parodies in this film, and the humor is cleverly written for both young and old viewers.
1546;You AND your kids will love this one!
1547;Shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a cool digitally.
1548;It is a Dreamworks film.
1549;The animation is pretty good but the whole movie never really impressed me beyond that.
1550;I thought this was a good movie until I got me a REALLY expensive S. video lead to replace my previous expensive one.
1551;I'd previously rated this movie 4 stars but seeing (more sharply and colourfully than ever!)
1552;all the fine work that's gone into it made me give it top score.
1553;Plus, this is the best movie ever!
1554;I found this movie to be enjoyable from the beginning to the end.
1555;This story is so good with a great message about accepting people as they are.
1556;Shrek is one of the greatest movies that I have seen in a long time.
1557;A real winner, although the sequel may be a little disappointing.
1558;Shrek is easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1559;It's full of subtlties that'll keep the viewer in stitches for the duration of the film, but also has a strong, deep story behind it .
1560;My family has watched this one several times now and we still enjoy it.
1561;Great humor for both little and big kids alike.
1562;I've had to sit through it considerably less, but I must admit that despite the repitition, this is still one good video.
1563;I had a great time with this one.
1564;Thankfully, I had a great time with this one.
1565;Technically, the film looks sharp with great character animation all.
1566;cast movie with humor that will please both young and old, without going too over.
1567;And I knew I had a winner when I watched it again and the scene was just as funny.
1568;mike Myers is excellent as the title character and Murphy is a delight as Donkey.
1569;Desperate to have his home back, Shrek meets with the Farquaad and strikes a deal with him.
1570;Along the way is adventure, friendship, and hilarious Disney references.
1571;And that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.
1572;an old movie, but a new favorite of my grandbabies.
1573;Shrek was one of the best movies I've seen this year.
1574;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy were hilarious.
1575;I just saw Shrek last night with my three kids, ages 6, 9 and 12.
1576;All found this movie to be fun and engaging.
1577;The story was funny, moved well and had a GREAT ending.
1578;This is a truly unique movie in that it pleased all three of my kids and I paricularly enjoyed the jabs at Disney!
1579;Between the killer commentary from Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers, kids and adults will be kept riveted to the screen.
1580;In many ways, this movie was enjoyable the way Aladin was .
1581;Robin Williams jokes were funny to kids on one level but enjoyable for adults on another.
1582;Not a live film yet not quite an animated film, this flick was truly unique.
1583;Beside the amazing graphics, the story line was what you would expect without being overly predictable.
1584;But the real story is the characters.
1585;Mike Myers was a phenomenal Shrek.
1586;The voice, it's accent, and inflections really made the character both funny and endearing.
1587;This is an instant classic that you should be able to enjoy time and again.
1588;If you thought Antz was funnier and more hard.
1589;up humour of this film.
1590;This fantastic movie is about his delightfully fractured fairy tale.
1591;This movie is the right stuff for this computer.
1592;animated adaptation full of verve and wit.
1593;tale creatures (including the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and the Gingerbread Man),from there own home, they settle in Shrek's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad.
1594;The story is stronger than most animated fare, but it's the humor that makes Shrek a winner.
1595;Shrek is never as warm and inspired as both Toy Story films, but the perfect realistic computer animation and an pretty good soundtrack (Smash Mouth, Baha Men) keep the entertainment in fine form.
1596;Know I know what you are thinking, It has to be a famous Disney movie!
1597;It's is prouduced by DreamWorks, who does a spectacular job.
1598;This is a great movie.
1599;eddie Murphy was sooo funny as the donkey side kick.
1600;this one is a must see and I recommend this movie for the entire family.
1601;What a bloody fantastic movie!!
1602;This isnt even a Disney movie!
1603;Its a movie that will be liked from ages 5.500!
1604;its the funniest anamated movie ever made and with the fantastic cast involved you will agree!
1605;I've watched it numerous times and I am still enjoying it.
1606;A very complete package with both pan and scan on one disk and widescreen on the other.
1607;Funny and good for the whole family.
1608;Great tie in to most traditional fairy tales!
1609;The jokes are there for all ages, and will keep you laughing for the entire movie.
1610;All I can say after seeing this DreamWorks production is WOW!
1611;Shrek likes his privacy because.
1612;well, he's an ogre and ogres need their privacy.
1613;He sends the seven dwarfs, Pinocchio, a gingerbread man, and assorted other lovable creatures out into the cold, heartless world.
1614;The woman in question is Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lady imprisoned in an imposing castle watched over by a fire.
1615;Shrek grows fond of the imaginative Fiona, and she of him, but their physical forms seem to prohibit any possible romantic union.
1616;Will Shrek muster up the courage necessary to rescue his beloved from the evil lord?
1617;Most importantly, will the ogre take Fiona with him back to the swamp so the two can share his cherished privacy?
1618;You ought to know the answers to these questions before the film even starts, but seeing how everything turns out is the fun part.
1619;Shrek is quite possibly the most enjoyable animated feature, television or movie, that I've ever seen.
1620;First, the voiceovers are wonderfully full of energy and emotion.
1621;Moreover, the animators made sure to craft the main characters so that they look like their actor counterparts, i. e. Shrek looks like Mike Myers, Donkey resembles Eddie Murphy, and so on.
1622;Second, the CGI effects are incredibly detailed, so much so that it's almost frighteningly realistic.
1623;Third, """"Shrek"""" is contemporary while staying true to the old fairytale form."""
1624;The movie's loaded with great double entendres that little kids won't likely understand but will keep adults engaged.
1625;My favorite supplements included a look at Myers, Diaz, Lithgow, and Murphy doing the voiceover work and the behind the scenes stuff describing how the animators performed their computerized magic.
1626;This great movie follows in the tradition of other animated films like Toy Story , Ice Age , and Monsters Inc. where adults and children alike will enjoy it.
1627;Shrek wins a competition held by Farquaad to rescue Fiona on the condition that he gets his swamp back.
1628;"finally, Fiona is rescued from the dragon, but Shrek is experiencing a feeling he's never felt before
1629;Will Shrek get his beloved swamp back?I found this to be an excellent movie.
1630;I watched this movie with my two young children and they were captivated the entire time.
1631;The music in the film is good, too, especially the remake of the Monkees' I'm a Believer .
1632;Watch this movie and get a good chuckle.
1633;A fantastically fractured fairy tale that prods fun at every childhood story character and plot line that ever existed.
1634;Every year computer animation gets better and better and this movie uses it to the fullest extent.
1635;There is no better format for this movie either.
1636;The number and diversity of the characters is well played out and well displayed in computer generation.
1637;Out of selfishness, Shrek goes to see Lord Farquaad and ends up striking a deal to rescue a princess in order to get his swamp back.
1638;Along the way, Shrek finds more to the princess then he thought he ever would, strangely there is something of a soul mate in this beautiful fairy tale lady.
1639;She can very well take care of herself, fighting off bandits in Matrix style kung fu precision and keeping up with Shrek in a display of bodily functions.
1640;This all leads up to a nice morality play ending that doesn't push the issue and lends to nice surprise as well.
1641;All the actors do a splendid job of voicing their characters.
1642;Everyone is alive and flowing.
1643;Murphy is especially hilarious, topping his performance as the mini.
1644;Funny, satirical, playful and beautifully animated, this movie holds all the right cards for entertainment.
1645;I ended up loving it!!
1646;It is such a super movie.
1647;This movie is one of the better movies that has come out of Hollywood lately.
1648;The first time I saw it was with my five year old son.
1649;He insisted we see it again and again.
1650;like the square flower arrangements in Farquaad's mansion, or the realistic leaves blowing in the wind .
1651;This movie is appropriate for most age levels and almost all humor levels.
1652;This is one that I know my husband will sit down and watch with us because it is so funny.
1653;Shrek is a 'fairytale' with all the traditional ingredients .
1654;a princess locked in a tower, a hero on a quest to save her, a scheming villain, true love leading to a happy (if somewhat unexpected) ending, and a supporting cast including everyone from a delightfully French Robin Hood to the gingerbread man.
1655;And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud.
1656;All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect).
1657;the computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices.
1658;There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway.
1659;It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive .
1660;see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect).
1661;But as Princess Fiona ultimately learns, 'perfect' is an illusion and only once you accept who you are, can you live happily ever after.
1662;Got it the day after I wrote this.
1663;Still took longer than I would have liked.
1664;I first saw it with my friend, but I decided to go back a second time with my little sister.
1665;The movies has a good plot, and it is really entertaining!!
1666;A very funny fairy tale parody with a wonderful message .
1667;real beauty is found within.
1668;this is definitely PG .
1669;some body function humor, gingerbread man saying eat me!
1670;, very veiled comments about a small man compensating for the size of his sexual prowess , etc.
1671;I'll be honest"
1672;I was mostly successful in avoiding the DreamWorks marketing machine, so the movie was able to speak for itself.
1673;and I didn't leave the theater disappointed!Shrek is a very funny movie, which turns every storybook convention on its ear (or cone.
1674;He has also decreed that all fairy.
1675;tale creatures in the land are to be rounded up and sent to relocation camps so that his domain will be perfect.
1676;In order to gain some peace, and get back to his solitary existence, Shrek decides to pay a visit to this Lord Farquaad to demand that the fairy.
1677;Lord Farquaad decides that Shrek shall become his champion to free Princess Fiona from her prison (tall tower, fire.
1678;breathing dragon, enchantments, the usual), and return her to the kingdom, so that Lord Farquaad can marry her, and become a king.
1679;In return, Shrek shall get his home back.
1680;and so begins a wonderful fairy tale!
1681;Like all great family films, Shrek works on many levels.
1682;there is a moral, naturally.
1683;And there is True Love.
1684;The film always stays true to its roots as a fairy tale.
1685;I'll let you figure out what the moral is (so as not to ruin the ending), but suffice to say that it is an important thing for kids to learn.
1686;on technical grounds, Shrek is amazing.
1687;Now THAT is a testament to the skill of the filmmakers!
1688;The crew of Shrek is the same crew that worked on Antz, and they took the facial animations up another notch, by giving their humans realistic features.
1689;The characters' faces are so well animated that emotions are made possible by subtle facial changes.
1690;Combined with the excellent voice acting of the cast, the characters become 3.
1691;dimensional in emotion, as well as space.
1692;The filmmakers prove that Shrek is about more than just flashy eye.
1693;this film has a lot of charm, and it made me laugh consistently.
1694;It proves that a film that relies on technology can only succeed if it has a heart to support it.
1695;So please, take time out to see the ogre who is deeper than he lets on ( like an ONION! )
1696;who always lets you know how he's doing.
1697;This film is genuinely funny.
1698;The humor is perfect for kids and adults.
1699;This makes the film that much more enjoyable for adults because they are finally getting one over on the kids.
1700;The plot is great, the music is great.
1701;notch film that you can enjoy over and over again.
1702;I took my son to see it and was amazed that a kids movie could be so fun.
1703;Mike Myers is wonderful as Shrek and Eddie Murphy Is hilarious as the Donkey.
1704;cameron Diaz is also wonderful as the princess.
1705;a Wonderful story and the animation is outstanding.
1706;I would recommend this movie for anyone at any age.
1707;The king orders all of the fairy tale creatures out of his kingdom, so they end up at Shrek's.
1708;He wants them off his land, so he approaches the king to have them removed.
1709;without giving everything away, I will close now.
1710;just remember, this is a movie for everyone, not specifically children.
1711;This movie will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh.
1712;This movie is great and , unique.
1713;I absolutely love this movie, it has a little bit of humor for everybody in there.
1714;The whole family laughs the whole way through!!!
1715;The extras are cute and funny instead of being hokey or dull.
1716;I especially liked the dance party and the interviews with the actors.
1717;This is one I will watch again and again.
1718;I'm a gramma and I enjoyed Shrek as much as the kids did!
1719;It has some great, gross 10.
1720;He just wanted to be liked and accepted.
1721;The trailers sure looked humorous.
1722;"Alas, it showed all the good parts
1723;I'll stick with Monsters, Inc., thank you very much.
1724;Let's face it: Shrek is overrated.
1725;The opening sequence pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie, as it should, in case you have any doubts.
1726;Disc 1 contains the full.
1727;rOM stuff is great, particularly the voice.
1728;So good, really the best film of our generation.
1729;Amazing social and political commentary on 21st century issues.
1730;This is one for us to show our kids!!!
1731;Seeing it again I can now appreciate the humour of the character more, I suppose he's too frenetic at first impression.
1732;And poot humour is something that all kids find funny, like it or not.
1733;Yes, Shrek had cheered me up!Okay it's not really a kid's movie I agree.
1734;Let your kids see if they want, that's my view.
1735;Shrek is good escapist fun.
1736;I find the CG images astonishing, and it's a movies that you can watch many times just to savour the images and see what subtleties you missed the first time around.
1737;And whether it's the Gingerbread man saying """"eat me!"""""""
1738;Yet it's always done good naturedly.
1739;As a piece of good old fashioned feel good entertainment Shrek is a winner.
1740;The finale of the the entire cast dancing to The Monkees I'm A Believer should make everyone laugh.
1741;Shrek is a wonderfully animated movie with plenty of tonal shifts and ever.
1742;The donkey is probably the best animated character I've seen.
1743;I give it three stars on the strength of its dazzling animation.
1744;I was really interested to see it after all the good things I had heard.
1745;In fact what makes Shrek (and Shrek 2) so enjoyable is the quirky sence of humor as it pokes fun and paradies elements of not only fairy tails but all sorts of pop culture.
1746;There are references and tributes to other movies such as the Matrix and in the second movie, the Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Park.
1747;Shrek is a fun movie that pokes fun at other fairytales while being a fairytale itself.
1748;She was expecting a handsome prince but she.
1749;The script gives us a clever twist where she's cursed and becomes Ogar at night time.
1750;It has a heart, it's funny and the voice acting is great.
1751;Shrek and Princess Fiona are happily married and are on their honey moon.
1752;I have to say that this must be the best movie ever.
1753;And like Shrek, the ogre, Shrek, the movie, is like an onion.
1754;There is the first layer of animation, which is superb.
1755;The characters, although cartoony, are very detailed, and the voices are superb.
1756;The jokes are done very tastefully, and they are definetly much more decent than the way kids talk nowdays.
1757;Older kids(7.15) and adults will love the humor.
1758;Shrek and Fiona, and even Donkey too some extent are quite deep.
1759;Both Shrek and Fiona have their wishes, hopes and desires.
1760;set notions of true love , and has her life planned down to the last detail.
1761;Part of the story is how she comes to term with the circumstances, and in doing so, finds her true self.
1762;The realtionship between Donkey and Shrek as best friends is really beautiful and so realisticNext is the dialogue.
1763;The dialogue is full of humor, but it also at the same time manage to be quite deep.
1764;The conversation between Shrek and Onion on how Ogres are like onions is astonishingly simple and yet so descriptive of the character.
1765;The author must have given a lot of thought on how to represent the character in such a simple, clean, easy yet meaningful termsLast is the music.
1766;Kids, and even some adults will love watching it again adn again and again
1767;What an amazing movie experience.
1768;The most entertaining, hilarious, and magical movie to come around in years.
1769;Filled with eye popping animation and heartfelt performances from the entire cast Shrek is probably the best film of the year.
1770;The animation is so good I forgot I was watching and animated film.
1771;cameron Diaz is feisty, fun, and yes even sexy as Princess Fiona.
1772;shrek is a masterpiece and hopefully will not be ignored at this years Oscars.
1773;Shrek is fun to watch young or old!
1774;I am very happy with the movie.
1775;My husband and I wanted to take our 2 year old son to his first movie, and this is the one we chose.
1776;We loved it and it kept his attention.
1777;This movie is a MUST for this summer!
1778;"To start, the story is excellent
1779;The plot has been rehashed repeatedly here so suffice it to say that """"Shrek"""" is a """"fractured fairytale"""" in the tradition of the old cartoons by the same name."""
1780;The movie is also loaded with inside jokes, innuendo and oblique references that make it as much fun for adults as children.
1781;"It reminds me of Disney's ""Aladdin"" in its ability to contain a high level of sophistication while still being enjoyable as a ""children's"" movie."
1782;"the animation is also gorgeous
1783;The difference between technology and art is heart, and the animators clearly recognized this fact.
1784;The settings and characters all have a sense of whimsy and innocence absent from other CGI (Star Wars for example).
1785;it is the voice talent that really makes the movie, however.
1786;Mike Meyer's provides the voice for the gruff, but lovable Shrek, Cameron Diaz's spirit shines through as the princess, and Eddie Murphy is brilliant as the Donkey.
1787;The supporting cast is likewise outstanding, particularly John Lithgow as Lord Farquart.
1788;in the end, """"Shrek"""" is rightly being touted as one of the best movies of 2001."""
1789;The voice talent and animation are both superb, and the story is entertaining and has great messages about inner beauty and the importance of friendship.
1790;Shrek is a great movie.
1791;he loved it and asks to watch it everyday.
1792;It is funny and it teaches a great lesson on how not to judge others by their appearances.
1793;We enjoy watching it as a family and laughing together.
1794;It is a must have for movie buffs!!!
1795;Congrats Dreamworks on a job well done!!!
1796;Fiona is locked away inside a castle surrounded by a fire breathing dragon.
1797;Farquaad holds a tournament to determine the princesses rescuer.
1798;Shrek (Mike Myers) wins the tournament and makes a deal with Farquaad.
1799;Farquaad agrees and together Shrek and his loundmouth donkey (Eddie Murphy) set off on an unforgettable adventure.
1800;This is a great film for all ages.
1801;There is the perfect mix of humor for the younger and older audience.
1802;The voice overs by the actors is excellent and the CGI is just jawdropping(look out Pixar).
1803;These are major addons to a great movie.
1804;When's the last time you took your kids to a movie, and enjoyed it as much as your kids?
1805;family movies that the whole family enjoys!
1806;overdose of hilarity like Shrek.
1807;I laughed so hard I cried, and the weird thing is, my wife and my 3, 6, and 9.
1808;If they won't go, go yourself!
1809;It's totally computer animated yet has exceptional voice acting.
1810;The Voice acting is done by proven professional comics.
1811;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy bring their characters to life!
1812;All ages can enjoy this movie.
1813;Rarely have I seen a animated or computer generated movie that could keep the interest of both adults and children.
1814;Shrek takes place in a medieval.
1815;All you gotta do is make a kid's movie that adults will like too.
1816;Finding Nemo and a host of other movies.
1817;"this movie is very funny from the outset when the appropriately named ""Lord Farquaad"" banishes all of the cute Fairy Tale People from his Kingdom."
1818;Eddie Murphy is great as the voice of Donkey and this is the first movie where Mike Myers did not annoy me at all.
1819;something for everyone , very good story with knights in armer , dragons .
1820;princes , and a very likable guy called shrek .
1821;my family liked the movie from start to finish .
1822;I give it two thumbs up !
1823;1 to 5 stars doesnt give Shrek Justice .
1824;I give it a complet 10 stars .
1825;believe me , Once you see it you'll feel the same way .
1826;For anyone who works or worked at Disneyland, the movie becomes a bit more special.
1827;Shrek (Mike Myers) takes over with his witty cracks.
1828;The Disney shots are great.
1829;A classic story line with new.
1830;This is one of the classics we come back to watch again and again over the years.
1831;Shrek is the ideal family movie that pokes fun at fairy tale creatures like the gingerbread man with his gumdrop buttons (which still makes me laugh), the magic mirror, and Pinochio.
1832;Additionaly, it is totally hilarious.
1833;The style of animation is also very cool and unlike any other style I've seen.
1834;Best Movie of 2001, this outstanding and stunning piece of computer animation has been the most compelling one since Toy Story and Toy Story 2 .
1835;This movie succeeds on practically every level.
1836;In any case, Shrek has a stunningly detailed and beautiful look to it.
1837;The scenes are really breathtaking as well as creative and functional.
1838;Great voice talent all around, including Cameron Diaz, who suprised me with her commanding voice work in this film.
1839;This movie is a masterpiece and I know I'll enjoy it for all time.
1840;This movie is, by far, the Best Movie Ever!
1841;It speaks volumes towards those who thought they could never have a fairy tale (or any!)
1842;romance because of their looks, the social and media perceptions towards them, etc.
1843;I truly watching this movie with my family.
1844;There was something it it for everyone, and the music is great!
1845;theres a great extended ending where the characters sing some well known songs.
1846;When I went to Universal Studios I was TERRIFIED to see Shrek 4D.
1847;As for the movie (Shrek) it is one of my favorite movies ever.
1848;"as a Video Editor, I truly found this movie an unbelievable experience for the entire family
1849;I laughed so hard, I had tears flowing down my cheeks.
1850;This movies is a lot of fun.
1851;I think it is creative, and it is definitely clever.
1852;The only bad thing about this movie is that a good number of the jokes are poking fun at other movies, so they may not be understood by everyone.
1853;But it is well done, and the computer animation is excellent.
1854;I would definitely recommend this movie.
1855;This was a hilarious movie, Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers were perfectly cast, and did wonderfully.
1856;A lot of the jokes in the movie are going to go over the younger sets heads, but that's what makes the movie so perfect.
1857;this is also one of the best all digital fill I've seen, and to this point I've seen most of them.
1858;Just love animated films, especially when they are well written and animated.
1859;Great graphics, dialog and voices.
1860;Great choice of Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers for Donkey and Shrek.
1861;I can't tell you how many people have told me this is a great movie.
1862;Hollwood has finally killed all sense of taste and originality.
1863;Meyes, despite his confounding dialect, makes a terrific OGRE, while Eddie Murphey proves his mettle as one of the finest comedians of our time.
1864;Cameron Diaz is terrific, and John Lithgow shines too, but perhaps the film's finest moments are its toungue.
1865;Best of all are the Three Little Pigs, whose fey German accents will make you whoop with laughter.
1866;rom drive plus you can actually do voiceovers for the characters in the scenes.
1867;The movie is the best animated movie I have ever seen.
1868;They do a wonderful job and make the movie great.
1869;This movie is the funniest movie out there.
1870;With jokes all the way through it, it makes this movie the best.
1871;The end is the funniest.
1872;The whole way through they are making fun of other movies.
1873;About the film itself, viewing it for the first time makes the viewer astounded.
1874;Of course you might know about the I'm A Believer finale"
1875;Thank goodness this little treat was included.
1876;It'll have you singing along and laughing!
1877;There are more special features than those listed on the page.
1878;, interviews with the characters (neat.
1879;Wonderful music, neat scenery, and the humor of the loveable, memorable characters are such sumptious formulas.
1880;The scenery especially makes you want to be there.
1881;Shrek is such a fabulous movie for all ages.
1882;This movie is a great family movie to watch and you have to go see it.
1883;Then he meets donkey, a talking donkey that persuades Shrek to let him live with him.
1884;At the wedding ceremony she turns back to an ogar and the prince doesn't like it and tries to [get]her and Shrek, but of course the good guys always win.
1885;This is a movie for everybody, its short and sweet, and pretty funny at the same time.
1886;The story is quite simple and proceeds in a very linear manner.
1887;Shrek decides to see the Lord and set things straight.
1888;At first we see the Lord's men paying rewards for the capture of fairy.
1889;I personally do not feel this is appropriate for young children but you can make up your own mind.
1890;Eddie Murphy really makes the movie.
1891;I thought I would just watch a few minutes.
1892;"The short ""king"" was hilarious!!!"
1893;And I really enjoyed the fire breathing dragon falling in love with the donkey.
1894;One of the best movies ever made.
1895;Our family owns all three releases .
1896;makes for a great evening, rather than watching something not intended for children on TV.
1897;I love Shrek and my daughter does too!
1898;honestly, when i went to see TS2, i was like ok, it'll be cute like the first one.
1899;it was an absolutely marvelous movie.
1900;so please please PLEASE wake up!
1901;It's a good movie to watch the kids, and it is funny too.
1902;I will get all the shrek movies, because shrek is cool.
1903;This animation is in the realm of the surreal.
1904;it was done extremely well, in the sense that it was balanced between realism and a sense of cartoonish animation that make it light hearted and more relaxed.
1905;It's a movie for a wide range of audiences.
1906;Many of the jokes adults would find very funny.
1907;It has appearances from many of the traditional children's stories.
1908;I find the ReVoice Studio feature very entertaining.
1909;The lip sync is easily done with software, making it look very professional.
1910;I'm a fan of computer animated movies, and when I saw this one, I really got into it.
1911;Eddie Murphy did a really good job doing donkey.
1912;He is really funny, the way he talks is incredible.
1913;the movie is kind of based on the Once upon a time.
1914;beginning fairy tale, and has a lot of characters from all the fairy tales, like snow.
1915;it's very fun to watch.
1916;Pay attention to the donkey's face while Shrek talks.
1917;It was great to watch, just ordered and watch.
1918;I don't watch many animated features but I did watch Shrek and I thought it was an excellent movie.
1919;The actors brought the characters to life and I really liked the movie.
1920;People of all ages will surely enjoy this digitally enhanced animation.
1921;Aside from the humor, the romance adds spice to the fairy tale story of Shrek Princess Fiona.
1922;It is an insult to all the genuine 1.
1923;There are fantastic animated movies (Toy Story 1 2, A Bug's Life) and there are fantastic children's movies (A Princess Bride) and then there is this.
1924;Take a class in drawing and learn how to look at people.
1925;You'll see the beauty in people, even if they are 'round', or 'short', or even 'hairy'.
1926;Best animated movie of our generation!
1927;My nephew loves this movie.
1928;Shrek has a good heart.
1929;This is a very funny movie and i really loved it!
1930;What a great spin off of the old fairy tales from years ago!
1931;I think anyone with a sense of humor would enjoy this one!!!
1932;Shrek is a WONDERFUL surprise.
1933;It is so good you'll forget you're watching animation.
1934;The jokes are hilarious and they poke fun at many fairy tales and conventions of society.
1935;a word of warning however: some of the humor and language is a bit edgy.
1936;But even if they don't go, you're sure to love the lovable Shrek!
1937;its very funny and has some silly jokes.
1938;I like it but I liked Shrek 2 a little bit better.
1939;Very funny and a great movie.
1940;It's one of those movies that anyone can enjoy.
1941;the chemistry between Shrek (mike myers) and the goat (eddie murphy) is fantastic.
1942;Add a princess played by cameron diaz and you have the perfect trio.
1943;It's got some real funny parts and along with the ultimate leason that it doesn't matter what you look like.
1944;popcorn and a comfy couch and poof the perfect nite!
1945;I loved the film and it's great for all ages, but I have to pick a bone with the mixed message.
1946;It carries the story directly from the last frame of the original Shrek, and has some information that leads up to Shrek 2.
1947;before seen extended ending, Amazing Behind.
1948;before seen extended ending, Menus featuring brand new animation created by Shreks directors and animators, The Tech of Shrek: A fascinating look into the production of Shrek, Exclusive Shrek X. box game playing hints, Storyboard pitch of deleted scenes engagingly acted out in a real.
1949;Original, fantastic writing, awesome animation/graphics!
1950;I would recommend it to anyone.
1951;Kids will love it, and it's got humor for adults as well.
1952;Upon seeing reviews me and my friends agreed to check it out.
1953;Its a perfect movie to see with your family.
1954;Take the time to see and enjoy it.
1955;Its really worth the money.
1956;This is an intelligent, sly, witty computer.
1957;The animation is top of the line yet still life.
1958;The film pokes fun at fairy tale cartoons and has a sense of humour that adults will appeal to as well as children.
1959;It isn't your typical family film but it's an excellent original one.
1960;I did not expect much when I was started to watch it, but I was pleasantly surprised.
1961;This is a truly entertaining movie.
1962;The good guy wins, gets the girl and its truly funny and moving at the same time.
1963;Kids and adults alike will enjoy.
1964;No violence, nothing inappropriate, a classic fairy tale with a modern twist from voices like Eddie Murphy.
1965;All the characters do a great job, and the casting for voices was well done.
1966;Great fun, with more humor for adults than 99% of the live.
1967;Myers and Murphy make an excellent team and one has to wonder what would have happened had Dreamworks broken the tradition of having voice.
1968;Alone these two are great and possibly some of the best ad.
1969;A billion pop culture references color this film but more than that, seeing your old fairy tale critters put on the screen in a less than normal light is worth the price of admission alone.
1970;The interrogation of the Gingerbread Man is possibly the funniest thing I've witnessed in ages.
1971;i was surprised that the Ogre, Shrek, liked any one at all.
1972;john Lithgow played his character well.
1973;There is definitely no comparison of Shrek to other Disney movies like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast .
1974;Today, I took a group of kids to the movies, and saw Shrek.
1975;Afterwards on the car ride home, the youngest (almost 7 years), was parroting the burp scene and how much she loved it.
1976;I agreed with her, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie Shrek.
1977;I took my son and his two small daughters to see Shrek last night, and three generations had a wonderful time.
1978;The movie hits the ground running, with the opening sequence setting the pace for drollity, surprise, and outright bellylaughs.
1979;It gently lampoons fairy tales, Disney, the Matrix.
1980;And the dragon is FABULOUS!
1981;Last spring, I headed out to the movie theaters with my family to see Shrek.
1982;It tells the story of Shrek, an ogre who just wants to be left alone.
1983;star cast of voices in this funny fairy tale.
1984;It is guaranteed to make anyone laugh.
1985;I reccommend it to any movie.
1986;goer who is looking for a funny film that's not just for kids!
1987;Eddie Murphey as the voice of donkey, Mike Myers the voice of Shrek,Cameron Diaz the voice of princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the voice of Lord Farquaad.
1988;I think that this is most hilarious, facinating movie on earth.
1989;Donkey is anoying i admit, but he is very funny.
1990;Shrek the great green fright machine might be a little mean to donkey sometimes, but he's also funny.
1991;The sound comes out clear, the charaters are very well made, and well everything is perfect!!!!
1992;It's worth it I swear.
1993;Not that I was that big a fan of Fiona either, mind you.
1994;My 3 year old loves this movie.
1995;I couldn't find it in the stores, but I can always count on Amazon to have it!
1996;My nephew was so excited to get it!
1997;THis has to be the funniest movie since, since ever!It will appeal to kids from the age of three to adults as old as they can get.
1998;The characters are original and side splittingly funny.
1999;Sure to bring the whole family together with its wit, charm and high morals.
2000;The characters range from a sarcastic but soft hearted ogre (mIke myers) to a beuatiful yet streetwise princess (Cmaron Diaz) and a charming, loyal and jjust down right funny, talking donkey (Ediie Murphy).
2001;This is a great movie for everyone!
2002;You could be 5 or 95 and you would enjoy this movie.
2003;It is great and so hilarious.
2004;Now that I have the movie I watch it every day and watch my favorite scenes over and over again, I also enjoy watching the extras that came with it.
2005;If you like comedy I recommend you get this movie.
2006;what's great about this movie: The story line is awesome, the female lead [Princess Fiona, Cameron Diaz] is a phenomenal *strong* woman, the sound track rules, the animation is gorgeous, the movie is absolutely HYSTERICAL in many places, the sly takes on Disney are very entertaining, etc. [This is the best fairly tale *I've* ever seen or read].
2007;The potty humor is over the top [and, having a preschooler, I'm pretty tolerant of potty humor].
2008;Some of the situations are adult as well.
2009;this is a GREAT movie .
2010;bought it for our grandson and he is 2 yrs.
2011;we still enjoy it and our grand son loves it!
2012;The entire family loves it.
2013;The movie came in a decent amount of time and was in perfect condition.
2014;This item was greatly priced.
2015;New movie for my 2 year old.
2016;This is such a cute movie great for kids and adults.
2017;It's characters are curt, wholesome characters, the humor I found boring and undermining to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.
2018;Give me something like the presence of Paula Poundstone or Rodney Dangerfield, live.
2019;i think this flim was great and really funny and if you have not watched it yet you should because it will make you laugh so much the donky is the best charter well that what i think
2020;I will probably go see this movie again, and for me that is very rare.
2021;great for adults or kids.
2022;Utterly original, terrific animated film, with great voice performances by Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy,written with lots of adult wit and humor.
2023;Charming, sweet, funny and romantic.
2024;amazing, hip use of music (including John Cale's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.
2025;It can sometimes be found used for a reasonable price.
2026;update: The best version is the new blu.
2027;ray, which is really terrific looking.
2028;ray just adds to the depth and color of the images.
2029;Only teenagers and adults can truly enjoy this movie.
2030;If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend that you do.
2031;Somebody should take a fair tale and twist it around to make it funny.
2032;A delightful and funny combination of favorite fairy tale characters.
2033;* and some of the best animation I've seen in a while.
2034;Maybe it's not as flashy as Final Fantasy : Spirit's Within, but it's certainly a notch higher up the ladder than Toy Story (did I mention the .
2035;I LOVE this movie!Not only does this movie deliver exceptionally good attention to detail in its computer generated images.
2036;ewww)The storyline and characters are unforgettable.
2037;very creative plot and a great film that would appeal to both kids and adults alike.
2038;Shrek is a playful comedy is full of love, comedy, action, retrospection, and fairy tale creatures that actively flirts with the audience from the beginning to the end.
2039;The film tied me up with humor that was meant for young and old, lay and expert, men and women.
2040;No, the best characteristic of the film was the concerns of real life that were brought up with charm and seriousness, which was made easily digested with the humor.
2041;Some of these real life concerns was friendship, love, discrimination, intolerance, and greed.
2042;In short, this is the best film I have seen this year, and it is far better than any other computer animated film that I have seen.
2043;I really enjoyed this film.
2044;Not only was it really cool with the new type of animation, it was very entertaining and had a great message.
2045;I enjoyed the fact that all the fairy tales were used and that the Ogre was not that evil of a character.
2046;I thought that the plot was well thought out and enjoyed by adults as well as children.
2047;My 4 year old and 18 month old love this movie .
2048;it is fun, has a GREAT message about not judging a book by it's cover and some wonderful music.
2049;Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers do outstanding jobs with their characters.
2050;There is some body function humor (e. g., passing gas and burping), but it is done in a funny way and my kids REALLY find those scenes funny.
2051;There are a couple minor swear words and some scary scenes (when the dragon is chasing them out of the castle) but it is handled well and goes by quickly.
2052;Neither of my kids even noticed the words being uses (I think there are 2 instances in the film) and the dragon scene ends in a funny way.
2053;I really think this is a great film and highly recommend it for all families!
2054;I got this movie for my dad since its his favorite movie, but he said it won't play past half way through.
2055;This is the best feel good entertaining comedy for many years!
2056;The graphics are amazing and the story itself is captivating.
2057;The movie can be enjoy by kids as young as 3 or 4 and adults.
2058;The adult humor is above the kids' head but not confusing.
2059;It is a wonderful family film.
2060;What makes it all the more valuable is the original story and the voices and personalities of the characters.
2061;It is amazing how much personality the graphic artists can give these computer characters.
2062;I know I cannot hear the voices and tones, but I certainly got the humor and recognized the artists behind the voices (through the drawings and through the attitudes of the characters).
2063;the story is sweet and poignant, and is essential viewing for children because of the concepts it teaches.
2064;The writing is definitely geared toward adults, though my granddaughter at three was mesmerized for the entire length of the film!
2065;this will definitely be a family favorite.
2066;everyone from my 7 year old to his grandma has watched it and enjoyed this film.
2067;it cost we have certainly got our moneys worth.
2068;year old to see this movie, and let me tell you, I think I laughed more than he did.
2069;I hate to use the term family classic because it conjures up images of Chitty.
2070;But, Shrek does have something for everyone.
2071;subtle) adult humor mixed with a great story and fun for kids, this movie was great for Dad and Son alike.
2072;It was a well thought out idea with excellent casting.
2073;The voice performances were excellent and the animation incredible.
2074;We recieved Shrek and Shrek II, from the kids.
2075;Usually our taste in entertainment is miles apart from our kid's and grandkids, but this film hit a home run with me.
2076;I laughed so hard I hurt the next day.
2077;Mike Meyers is a genius with voices, Eddie Murphy's donkey was absolutely right on.
2078;Great story, great characters and a happy ending.
2079;SHREK was a beautiful, lovely, funny, and silly film for all ages, from kids to senior citizens!
2080;Shrek (Mike Myers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are a good odd.
2081;couple and there are some great jabs at Disney throughout the film's running time.
2082;"There are some fantastically funny moments in the film, especially the gingerbread man sequence and lines like ""In the morning, i'm making waffles!"""
2083;And the escape from the dragon's castle is a tour.
2084;force of fantastic animation and strange gags.
2085;realistic water and fur simulation is brilliant.
2086;generated cartoons have come a long way and it's impossible to deny that the CG is impressive.
2087;Watching SHREK in comparison to Pixar's competition MONSTERS INC, the latter is a more clever premise.
2088;Shrek gets 5 stars for animation, but it's a 3 star movie for laughs.
2089;Well, as you know, Shrek was one of the most popular films of 2001.
2090;"Well, every Friday in math class we have our ""movie day"", and Shrek was the movie chosen last Friday."
2091;Myers, Murphy, and Diaz do great voice jobs.
2092;this video selection warmes my heart every time I play it.
2093;After all, every one's a winner, am I right?
2094;The Shrek which started it all is an imaginative unique look at Fairy Land.
2095;some of which will go swooping over even today's jaded kids.
2096;So this is where all the good writers in Hollywood are .
2097;shrek is clever, imaginative, and a joy to watch.
2098;loud funny and you only have to get through a few potty jokes in the beginning to get to the real fun.
2099;This is truly a film for all ages as a lot of the adult humor just goes right over kids' heads.
2100;This movie was so good I went to see it twice.
2101;I laughed just as hard the second time as I did the first.
2102;Mike Meyers does a wonderful job as the voice of Shrek (using his infamous Scottish accent).
2103;While the movie is great for kids, it's also good entertainment for grownups!
2104;This is a good movie, for adults as well as kids.
2105;Just the karaoke ending is worth the whole movie
2106;Shrek was so funny when my mom, me and a bunch of her friends went to see it.
2107;Shrek is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.
2108;Even though there parts in the movie thst younger kids won't get they will enjoy it all the same.
2109;Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers did an awesome job in this movie.
2110;If you don't have it laying around anywhere this is the perfect way to get your Shrek fix.
2111;I loved the humor in it.
2112;Even though Shrek is an ogre, he is still kind and lovable.
2113;And there are pop culture references hidden in there (If anyone has seen West Side Story, etc.) Gotta love the animations, all around great movie!
2114;Oh, and the extras are awesome too!
2115;My 3 1/2 yr old and 11 yr old boys love this movie!
2116;It's got a little adult humor mixed in with the great animation but I think it's fine for all audiences.
2117;It's definitely worth owning and watching over and over!
2118;This is an adult size, animated, color movie, with the witty voice of Edie Murphy .
2119;The plot for this movie is taken from those childhood fairy tale characters and rolled into one humorous cartoon.
2120;The voice of donkey is the great comedian Edie Murphy.
2121;His character added to the character of Shrek, voice done by Mike Myers, is an enjoyable light hearted entertainment that can be enjoyed by the child in all of us.
2122;Shrek is one of those movies that if you walk into the room and it is playing you will just have to take a break and sit for a spell.
2123;Wonderful twists and turns and just a darn good time for all.
2124;An echanting treat for all ages.
2125;If you haven't seen it yet, RUN to see it.
2126;If you have seen it, grab some friends and RUN to see it again.
2127;I watched Shrek on the plane to Los Angeles from Philly with United.
2128;Based upon the book of the same name by William Steig, this is a no holds barred, fractured fairytale, laden with humor, superlative animation, a great script, and a surprising ending.
2129;It is simply a fabulous film that is sure to appeal to young and old alike.
2130;He lives a solitairy, sterile, and lonely life in a swamp.
2131;After making the acquaintance of a loudmouthed, infectiously funny, talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has muscled in on Shrek's swamp, an outraged Shrek pays Lord Farquaad a visit, demanding answers about the influx of the homeless in his swamp.
2132;In return for a successful rescue, Shrek will once again be allowed to reign supreme in his swamp.
2133;the adventures that the donkey and Shrek have in their determination to fulfill their quest are fun filled and funny.
2134;Shrek, who speaks with a soft Scottish burr, is an ogre whose size and fearsome demeanor is belied by his tender heart.
2135;Mike Myers infuses this gentle, green giant with a tenderness that makes the viewer fall in love with Shrek.
2136;John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad.
2137;Cameron Diaz, who probably had the toughest role of all, is fine as the fiercely independent Princess Fiona.
2138;As Ms. Diaz does not, however, have a distinctive voice, her characterization pales alongside that of the other characters and is the weakest link in this otherwise sensational movie.
2139;The film has a surprise ending that is utterly charming and novel.
2140;It is an appropriate one for this unique and fiendishly clever film.
2141;Shrek is simply a great movie, animated or otherwise.
2142;Shrek is an excellent movie because of its blatant flaunting of conventions.
2143;"I'm sure a lot of kids like this film, but it's really for older folk
2144;full of biting wit, and nothing is sacred.
2145;recommended without reservation for all adults, and many kids too.
2146;I saw this at the movies with my grandchildren and we loved it and now we can watch it again.
2147;It's a kid's movie that adults can enjoy.
2148;This is really a must see movie!
2149;Its both cute and exciting, and will be enjoyed not just by kids, but people of all ages.
2150;at times it is hilariously funny, the characters are individual, interesting, quirky and memorable.
2151;the whole muffin man scene still makes me laugh after watching it over and over again.
2152;i love this movie because it is rely funny i like donkey he is funny this is my favorite out of the set
2153;This is one of the most visually exciting, well written opuses I have.
2154;I will be one of the first in line to make sure that I get a copy.
2155;I just got this for my grandkids (ages 8.
2156;girl) We watched it and laughed and laughed.
2157;company came and They loved watching it the next day.
2158;Story had a great moral to it.
2159;Shrek was Mike Meyer and i LIKED him in this!
2160;There's a Dragon,princess,storybook charectors,& a nasy little wantabe prince.5 isn't high enough it's a 10!
2161;VERY FUNNY and all ages will like it !
2162;This is a really great movie!!!
2163;My grandchildren and I love it!!
2164;We love the entire Shrek series!!
2165;This movie is one of a kind!
2166;take the whole family out to see it!
2167;An outstanding animated romantic comedy, Shrek, brings to the screen the love story between, an ogre (Shrek), and a beautiful princess (Fiona), with all the ups and downs that that entails!
2168;In addition, the couple finds itself in the company of adorable characters from classic fairy tales, with the cherry on the cake being the hilarious talking donkey.
2169;it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
2170;mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!
2171;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
2172;The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.
2173;Strongly recommended along with Shrek 2.
2174;The beauty is a captive in the tower, held by a dragon who we find out also needs love.
2175;The beauty has more going on as we see when she goes into action, which is quite a surprise, who knew she had that in her?
2176;The donkey is adorable and I think every animated movie needs one character written especially for Eddie Murphy!
2177;Shrek is animated to the max and the animators outdid themselves on this one by completely capturing all of Mike Myer's facial expressions!
2178;So I think this fable tells an important story, that we all have more inside to share and once you get to know someone that is the beauty that captures our attention as we get to know someone.
2179;(smile) What a surprise ending!
2180;Better catch it to find out the beauty's secret .
2181;I saw this movie first in the theaters and I absolutely loved it.
2182;It is a great movie to own for kids and adults alike.
2183;It is funny and has some adult humor that kids won't get that I loved.
2184;This was a very cute movie by Disney!Not as good as the classics of course.
2185;but still worth it!I sat with children and adults during this movie showing and It seemed as though more adults were interested in the movie than the kids were.
2186;It did have adult humor,yes.
2187;but still kids would enjoy the Digital/Graphic effects *as in the characters,and cute voices* throughout the movie!
2188;It's a great movie overall a MUST SEE!
2189;I thought this movie is one of the best animated movies to come around in awhile and I've seen alot of kids movies!!
2190;This movie had humor, suspence and even touched on the emotional side for the star the Ogar.
2191;It had an unusual ending to it which I thought was great because usually the endings are predictible and without giving it away even though it dosen't end the way you think you are glad it does because it shows that beauty is only skin deep and it's whats inside that counts.
2192;It holds your attention for adults and children.
2193;My nephews who are 7 and 9 loved it and have seen it 3 times already.
2194;Shrek is a great movie for children, as well as, adults.
2195;I would recommend it to anyone.
2196;There is a lot of adult humor mixed in to make it fun for everyone!
2197;This is an incredible animated feature.
2198;In some scenes they actually got it TOO perfect and had to dial back the realism factor to keep it in a semi.
2199;There are certain scenes in there, the gingerbread man on especially, that get me laughing even after many, many viewings.
2200;We've shown this to kids, adults, oldsters, and everything in between and everybody has loved it.
2201;and the meaning of the story is truly priceless.
2202;This has so many great lines that you can't screw up!
2203;part of the reason I find Shrek so wonderful, is that this is a hero that we can all relate to.
2204;So maybe our table manners are a bit better, but we can all relate to some of the emotions that are expressed.
2205;Underneath the ogre is a prince with a very tender heart.
2206;The sly jabs to Disney and other pillars of children's entertainment kept both my children and myself laughing, and a sense of justice is held.
2207;I am 13 and i just loved it.
2208;in the beginning i was shocked to see that donkey fly.
2209;I am so shocked that they got everything so cool into the movie.
2210;I went on the opening weekend for SHREK and I just loved it.
2211;All the voices are done incredibly well, with Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz doing an exceptional job!
2212;I just recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good 90 minutes of solid entertainment.
2213;Oh yeah, and my 4 year old daughter loved it too.
2214;It came quickly and in perfect condition.
2215;the second sign is that Shrek would be on a version of Operation.
2216;the third sign that the world is ending is that the Shrek 2 disc special edition has an average of 4 1/2 stars.
2217;Not knowing much about the movie when we took our eight year old to see it, we were plesantly surprised by the wit and humor of the script.
2218;Some may consider the humor and wordplay mildly crude but it is delightful for youngsters.
2219;I personally enjoyed the earwax scene.
2220;The film's animation is superb and the soundtrack is alot of fun.
2221;Overall the film is very entertaining.
2222;SHREK is one of those movies that when you first see it amazing you on many levels.
2223;From the kids point of view it has characters and color and action and lot of slapstick cartoon humor.
2224;For the adults it has innuendos and under tones and a lot of intellectual humor.
2225;There is an ogar named Shrek who wants to be left alone in his area of the forest.
2226;ruler, Shrek is invaded by all the old fairytale character every created by the Brothers Grimm and all the other fairytales we grew up with and loved.
2227;the movie is best represented by the talents of Mike Meyers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (The Donkey), John Lithgow (The King to be) and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona .
2228;these are the people that make this humorous and touching.
2229;Extremely detailed and hours of things to see and watch.
2230;I would recommend this for every family.
2231;My kids, granddaughter and I love this movie.
2232;This is by far one of the best movies produced!
2233;Shrek is the movie to see this summer!
2234;Mike Myers is great as the title character, though my favorite was Eddie Murphy as Donkey.
2235;This film has it all .
2236;This is some of the best work Mike Myers has done.
2237;just enough scary parts to spice up the viewing w/o actually causing nightmares or anything and the humor is always there for the adults.
2238;compassion and empathy makes it a worthwhile viewing for people of any age.
2239;This movie is a creative milestone for animated movies, not only for the animation but for its warmth, charm and delightfully loopy dialogue.
2240;There are also underlying positive themes of forgiveness, acceptance and helping each other out that are refreshing.
2241;shrek is the story of an ogre who starts out on a quest to save his home and finds love and friendship along the way.
2242;His journey is told from a """"fractured fairy tale"""" point of view that keeps you laughing and engaged."""
2243;Every character from every fairy tale seems to be in the movie and that is part of what makes it so hilarious.
2244;"the interaction between the main characters is the main reason the movie is so funny: Shrek, the mean ogre who actually has a heart of gold and just wants to be accepted as he is
2245;All turns out well in the end.
2246;Recently saw Shrek the musical and wanted to rewatch Shrek the movie.
2247;I love this movie and the play was wonderful.
2248;In fact, it makes fun of all those Disney movies even though most of the inspiration for this film come from them.
2249;overall the film is entretaining and fun.
2250;The character animation is truly amazing as movements and speach are very belivable.
2251;This movie has to be one of the most overated movie's ever .
2252;i came into this movie thinking I would see a great movie as I had been told by masses boy was I wrong .
2253;The movie starts out great with many funny moments.
2254;The animation and acting was great"
2255;And with the second movie coming out, this is a good warm.
2256;I would recommend this movie to everyone, it is fun for all ages.
2257;it arrived In great condition,great price too.
2258;Great movie for visiting grandchildren.
2259;The movie was exactly as advertised and I received it a few days after placing my order.
2260;disc set, most of them great.
2261;as a movie, lots of fun and with a message that's close to the heart of those of us who aren't fairy.
2262;Yes, it is a children's movie, but it's really good.
2263;It's funny and interesting to watch.
2264;The movie itself is worth watching.
2265;This animation isn't only for kids as there are some very clever send.
2266;ups of Disney as well as other cartoon characters.
2267;Then there's the terrific animation, which is fun to see by itself.
2268;The real charm of the flick is the multi.
2269;level story line, making it appealing for both adults and children, and as I mentioned, the jibes at some of the more venerated cartoon icons are well done and very funny.
2270;I think Shrek is a brilliant film, and enjoy it even more than both of Disney's Toy Story movies (which I still think are very good).
2271;Also, even though the rapport between Buzz and Woody is great, the same can also be said of that between Shrek and Donkey.
2272;Fantastic computer graphics, excellent script, superb chemistry between Myers Murphy, great music score, hilariously funny, and just an all.
2273;Shrek tries desperately to be funny, in a Disney's Aladdin sort of way.
2274;The trouble is, however, that there are more witty insights and genuinely intellectual humor in a single episode of the Simpsons than in all of Shrek.
2275;It's fairly easy to see why.
2276;Shrek has the look and feel of an edgy film made by a committee of bankers.
2277;Again, there are clever moments here, but nothing great.
2278;It's simply too bad that this represents perhaps the best animated film in years.
2279;One can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to have Chris Farley voice the lovable green lump.
2280;"finally, the ""inside"" Disney jokes are okay, but just that."
2281;Put some bright teenagers to work and they could come up with stuff that is much funnier.
2282;And it gives some hope after seeing awful movies like Ice Age.
2283;See it once , see it many times.
2284;Awsome entertainment movie for the whole family.
2285;Looks like lots of fun, right?
2286;And while I have one that does, it's a Mac.
2287;There are two versons of the movie(formatted and widescreen) behind the scenes footage, and other interesting stuff.
2288;As many of you know by now, Shrek is great.
2289;This is why: not only does it entertain children and adults, but the animation is wonderful.
2290;Shrek has a wonderful soundtrack also, it brought back a lot of older music, but made it new for the younger generation.
2291;This is a wonderful family film that accomplishes soo much, keeping my two year old entertained for a couple of hours.
2292;Very good animation, to begin with.
2293;The details of Shrek and the donkey are remarkable!It easily qualifies as the funniest movie of its genre I've seen in a while, right there with Disney's 'The Emperor's New Groove'.
2294;Not that it's a slight detail: it's hard not to notice it, but it is highly enjoyable.
2295;in addition to this, there is a very original combination of contemporary pop/rock tunes with the scenes of the movie which takes it out of the traditional fairy tale genre.
2296;this brings home a warm and fun fealing to those who veiw it.
2297;me and my whole family enjoyed this movie so much we had to watch it 4 times.
2298;i found it not only just a great and entertaining movie, but a great learning tool as well.
2299;It was a hilarious movie with a cute story line, but I don't think I can consider it the best movie of the year.
2300;I definetly compared the two and I thought Monsters a more all around cute, hilarious, and great story line movie.
2301;Go see the 4D at Universal Studios and enjoy.
2302;But, deep down inside, I'm a rebel and a romantic, and very gradually I found myself cheering the lovelorn troll as he heads out on a quest to find someone else their one true love.
2303;so mule and ogre head of across their world to defeat a dragon and rescue the beautiful princess.
2304;If you've ever thought you were the ugly duckling, if you ever felt you weren't quite good enough, this film is for you.
2305;For once, the fairy tale is turned upside down, we are reminded that beauty is what's under the skin, and yes, that ogres need love too.
2306;And that it does very well despite it's declared preteen audience.
2307;Its message is universal, and it's reverse charm is infectious.
2308;the animation and music are excellent.
2309;This is a laugh and feel good film, and we don't really get enough of those.
2310;This is a great movie.
2311;Your kids will love it as much as you!
2312;I was relieved that Eddie Murphy's voice portrayal of the donkey character was good as I had heard.
2313;The young lady in the film is both personable and fun to watch.
2314;The ending is both fun and unexpected.
2315;I got this for my kids because everyone raved about how great it was.
2316;I admit that I laughed through most of it too.
2317;Good for kids of all ages.
2318;Adults and children will have a wonderful time watching this feature.
2319;Shrek was a laugh and thrill from the beginning until the end.
2320;Delightful, a movie that can be watched over and over and the one liners will definitely keep you laughing.
2321;The donkey and Shrek are a pair made in heaven.
2322;And everyone knows that you can't have a perfect kingdom with magical creatures around.
2323;So he makes a deal with Shrek .
2324;naturally, Shrek agrees to the deal.
2325;And she has a secret.
2326;All this makes the perfect fractured fairytale.
2327;this computer animated movie is a riot.
2328;There are also lots of great small gags, usually at the expense of a classic story.
2329;Along the way, the movie develops a great heart as well and subtly slips in a message about loving people for who they are.
2330;"The animation, while a bit rough on the ""extras"" is wonderful on the main characters."
2331;This is a fairytale for adults.
2332;I love it and Mike myers and Eddie Murphy gave real funny performances in this film.
2333;Cameron Diaz also gave a good performance as Princess Fiona.
2334;It's a feel good film.
2335;This is a great movie.
2336;The first disc has the games and fun special features .
2337;The second disc has the more technically detailed special features, as well as the full widescreen movie (the one you should watch, since it has the whole thing .
2338;it also has a superior soundtrack since there's a DTS soundtrack).
2339;It takes a miniute to get used it it being shrunk down to fit the whole thing on your TV, but it really is nice seeing the sides of the picture:)
2340;The voices were well cast and performed.
2341;It has both adult (clean adult) and kids humor.
2342;The writers plagerized just about everyone and it was hilarious.
2343;. . . There is a sticker on EVERY box saying it's a winner.
2344;Each box has eligebility to win a prize, from a Kia car to X. box game consoles to Baskin Robins Ice cream.
2345;If you like Austin Powers type humor you'll be happy.
2346;Take a fairy tale turn it around, add a pinch of homely hereos and heroines, a dash of great animation, 2 cups of great humor and you have Shrek!
2347;Must see, twice, must own.
2348;But the humor stayed through the whole thing.
2349;The fairy tale characters will make you lagh your heart out.
2350;Diaz and Myers did a fabulous job but Murphy was better than anyone.
2351;Shrek, although, is not for the very little kids.
2352;It has a bit of adult humor and a tad of profanity, but it's more for ages 6 and older.
2353;Well, I saw this movie last night, opening night, here in lovely old Seattle, Washington.
2354;this show starts out funny, and only gets better.
2355;Yes, it is an animation, full of Disney characters, but this movie reaches out to all ages in many ways.
2356;First and foremost, the animation and Disney characters and childish plot (save the princess!)
2357;i highly recommend that anybody interested go see this movie.
2358;child loves it and it was texactly what I ordered.
2359;This is an excellent movie for a child to watch
2360;I don't watch many family, flicks exsept for this I liked this funny movied combined all the classic, fairy tales well I think Eddie Murphy did a good job playing the donkey he talked a lot, well I do hope this comes out before Xmas.
2361;If you haven't seen Shrek, run out and do so right this minute.
2362;This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.
2363;Oh yeah, and he's green.
2364;All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn.
2365;subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound.
2366;Shrek brings a new millenium twist to animated fairy tale.
2367;The voice stars of the film, Mike Myersw as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the Prince were solid on the mark with perfect characterizations.
2368;A great film for kids to see for the animation and for adults, especially movie fans, for the Hollywood in jokes in the story.
2369;Packaging, cover and tape excellent.
2370;The first time I saw this movie it was funny.
2371;Then add Camron and John it was very funny.
2372;i rate this a five because even now I will watch it again and again.
2373;And I also garuntee that I will be one of the first 100 people to watch Sherk2 opening May 21st.
2374;subtle suggestive references to make even the most liberal of grandmothers blush.
2375;Shrek even has the nerve to try and rob children of their imaginations and love for classic fairytales as the movie continuously portrays timeless and wonderful characters like Snow White and Cinderella (the two Princesses, at one point, get into an argument which leads to a fist fight!)
2376;"up as well!That's really just about all I have to say regarding the movie ""Shrek""."
2377;I thought Shrek was 1 of the 10 best movies i've seen.
2378;Myers,And Murphy are the best comedy team.
2379;So, Shrek And Fionaend up getting married.
2380;Shrek dominated the animated full length feature category in 2001 (and some would say it still does) and the reasons why are clear: The movie moves at a good pace, with excellent painstaking animation and perfectly chosen voices for the characters.
2381;"There is much humor for both adults and children
2382;will do anything for Shrek's friendship.
2383;hahaha I thought that the donkey helped balance Shrek's irritable nature well into the film but perhaps the donkey could have been given a few more clever lines in the second half of the film.
2384;Some other interesting relationships develop along the way involving a dragon, Lord Farquaad, who wants to marry Fiona, the princess, just so he could be king, and the fairy.
2385;tale people of other classic fairy tales!
2386;GRINI was most amused by how the film pokes fun at classic fairy tales such as Snow White and Pinocchio.
2387;The most amusing lampoon was of Disney's Magic Kingdom which in the movie is actually the not too friendly home of Lord Farquaad.
2388;Watch it and see which famous Disney attraction is made fun of first!
2389;The sound is excellent, too.
2390;But the good news is this: DreamWorks went much further!
2391;There are some technical goofs which are good for another laugh and even a short featurette about the dubbing of the film for international audiences.
2392;You get to see how the drawing of each main character developed and there's even playing hints for Xbox Shrek games!In short, please get this movie and enjoy it!
2393;It's a pleasure for whole family!
2394;Thank goodness for Shrek 2!
2395;For many years, Jeffrey Katzenberg was his second.
2396;Katzenberg's most notable achievement was the revival of Disney's stagnant animated movie division.
2397;Under his guidance, the studio made commercially and artistically successful movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.
2398;That enterprise has been highly successful.
2399;Katzenberg is openly out to unseat Disney as the undisputed king of animation.
2400;Dreamworks had moderate success with The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado.
2401;Now comes Shrek, which is the highest grossing movie of 2001 so far.
2402;This all goes to prove that the American competitive spirit is alive and well in Hollywood.
2403;It operates on two levels.
2404;All age groups will have a great time.
2405;You might call it a revisionist fairy tale, one that manages to be smart, funny and thoroughly modern without once drifting into cynicism.
2406;Off Shrek goes to a dragon.
2407;the actors' voice talents are all quite good, but the one who is absolutely perfect is Eddie Murphy as the donkey.
2408;for the first time this year, there is an Oscar category for best animated movie.
2409;It will be a battle between Shrek and Disney's Monsters Inc. here's to competition!
2410;Follow the story of Shrek, an dissapointed Orge, who would be left alone.
2411;Shrek is highly original while spoofing several fairy tales and intermixing a lot of modern day jokes into the fairy tale background.
2412;Each of the main characters is extremely funny and they all interact well with each other.
2413;I loved this movie from the start and never grow tired of watching it.
2414;It's very very funny and kids and adults would both love it.
2415;This has got to be the best comedy of the summer!
2416;Although this animated tale might appeal to children, the humor is geared towards the adults.
2417;all I can say is that the punchlines are priceless, and the animation was excellent.
2418;It touches the heart in anyone.
2419;This is definitely a movie everyone can love, even a big green ogre!
2420;My one and two year old think that it is so funny and love watching it frequently!
2421;It is animated, but has the sutle humor needed to keep an adult entertained thoughout the show.
2422;I was particularly impressed by the marvellous facial expressions captured by the creators.
2423;The characters literally come to life on the screen!
2424;It is romantic, addresses moral issues in a manner that are not offensive, and includes a number of warm, beautiful songs that enhance the overall experience of this viewing.
2425;this region just happens to be Shrek's backyard.
2426;On a mission to clear his swamp of the excess baggage Shrek encounters a talking donkey (masterfully played by Eddie Murphy) an over romantic princess (played well by Cameron Diaz, even if her accent does tend to dissapear and reappear at the strangest moments) and a huge manage of other delightful characters.
2427;The computer graphics are so real that they jump off the screen.
2428;The characters emotions, expressions and mannerisms are so real that you can't help but get involved and find them endearing and loveable.
2429;The cast it perfect, from Mike Myers to John Lithgow and the script is genius.
2430;This is a movie that you and your children will LOVE, your children will love the fairy tale characters and the animations and any adult will find the grown up humor to be hilarious.
2431;The dialogue is very adult and sometimes raunchy and even the animation won't make the story clear for small children.
2432;This movie had my family and I in stitches I guarantee it'll do the same for you, it is a total keeper and a great film for your collection.
2433;Out of the first three Shrek movies, I have to say that this is the best.
2434;It's a fairly funny movie with a lot of great lines, though there were a couple of inappropriate (and in an entirely unneccessary way) jokes, but this movie has a nice mix of medievalism/fairy tales and modern.
2435;The movie was good and I've seen it a couple of times, but that question has always nagged at me.
2436;Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy providing the voices for Shrek and Donkey are the best comedic pairing.
2437;And Cameron Diaz is just as hilarious as Princess Fiona.
2438;but it's the little things like the Gingerbread Man being tourtured with milk, Robin Hood and his merry men dancing like there in Riverdance, the fairy tale characters being sold, it's insane and funny as hell!You want good laughs, minus profanity.
2439;think outside the box and get some good laughs at the same time.
2440;Shrek is a film I enjoyed watching just as much as my 11 year old and 9 year old children did.
2441;Accompanied by a witty donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), he outsmarts a fire.
2442;breathing dragon and tolerates a strong.
2443;When he falls in love with the princess he faces his greatest challenge and that is to feel worthy of her love.
2444;There's a transformation after they kiss which is the big surprise in this movie.
2445;From its Once Upon a Time beginning to its Happily Ever After ending, Shrek will warm your heart, tickle your funny bone and remind us all of the true meaning of beauty.
2446;Keep in mind that Shrek is rated PG and there are scenes that might be scary for young children.
2447;This movie leaves you feeling good about who you are.
2448;It was a good cut before we see the actual Shrek movie.
2449;Shrek is clever, straight forward, and just fun to watch.
2450;Very appealing to the eyes also.
2451;The voice acting fits perfectly, and the character designs are intriguing.
2452;Recommended to anyone in a Ogre mood, this'll cheer you up.
2453;The visual effects are amazing.
2454;the animation is nothing spectacular, and never had me """"ooing or aahhing"""" about any of it."""
2455;Just what we were looking for and we will truly get a lot of enjoyment from it!
2456;I love this movie because of the adorable little donkey.
2457;He is also the most underrated character in the movie.
2458;I say let's band together and give Donkey the respect he deserves.
2459;Some might say that it is just entertainment and doesn't ahve to mean anything but I think that movies can be entertaining for children and adults and be powerful.
2460;This movie was very funny.
2461;Overall, this movie was great for everybody.
2462;It was fun to watch it.
2463;I have to admit that I loved Donkey in this movie.
2464;He really ties things together.
2465;artistry and technology collide with brilliance!
2466;Shrek is one hour and thirty.
2467;The deal is the Lord Farquaad will clear out his swamp and return the swamp to its original beauty in return Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona.
2468;Shrek and Donkey arrive at the castle and rescue Princess Fiona.
2469;Shrek over hears both of them talking and he believes they are talking about him being ugly.
2470;Donkey arrives to tell Shrek that Fiona loves him and not Farquaad.
2471;Donkey has bought the dragon with him so Shrek can make it to the wedding and tell Fiona how much he loves her.
2472;Shrek is a very good movie to watch.
2473;The plot rolls right along and keeps you laughing at the right moments to laugh.
2474;A funny heartwarming story, hysterical humor for adults and kids alike, and visually stunning.
2475;Mike Meyers is hysterical as Shrek, a great choice IMO.
2476;And Eddie Murphy plays his most likeable character since Coming To America .
2477;for such a tall man in real life he portrays the Napolean little.
2478;as for the animation, it's mind.
2479;But in a few of the quieter scenes I made a point to check out the details, and the animation is truly amazing.
2480;"But the best part is the facial detail
2481;overall this was the most fun I've had in a theater in a long time.
2482;disc so. called full frame version, as opposed to the double disc, extras.
2483;It's interesting to note that, despite the version of Shrek it comes bundled with, Shrek 3.
2484;d for your collection (you can always sell the pan.
2485;d and just love Shrek.
2486;For example, Dreamworks partnered up with the computer animation studio, PDI, which is eerily familiar to the partnership made between Disney and Pixar Animation Studios just a few years earlier.
2487;Their first feature film together, Antz, was a modest success compared to Pixar's A Bug's Life, which was released nearly one month after.
2488;Now Dreamworks once again turns to PDI to create a full length animated film based on a children's book entitled Shrek.
2489;Mixing in the voice talents of rising stars Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz as well the famous comedian, Eddie Murphy, might make this relatively modest feature a big hit.
2490;But are Katzenberg's intentions more then making an entertaining family film?
2491;Bet Disney is real happy about that and they'll be even happier if it proves successful.
2492;the story for Shrek takes a twisted look at the classic fairy tales like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Pinocchio.
2493;tale animated films for much original ideas that worked.
2494;The best lines of Shrek come from Eddie Murphy's annoying talking donkey named .
2495;Cameron Diaz, who voices Princess Fiona, is decent but nothing extraordinary unlike John Lithgow who voices Lord Farquuad.
2496;overall, Shrek is a moderate film at best and doesn't even come close to living up to the hype that DreamWorks and the movie going public built it up to be.
2497;It's cute and insanely funny at the same time!
2498;The graphics in this movie are awe inspiring, especialy when you find out they had to dum them down to make them more cartoony!
2499;Also check out the extended ending!
2500;Thats all I can say!
2501;Lots of adult humor that the kids will laugh at because you are laughing.
2502;Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid.
2503;But you have to be awake to see it.
2504;For the most part I love this movie.
2505;Any age at all will definitely enjoy and absolutely love this movie!
2506;Fun happy movie that will leave you in a great mood every time you'll view this classic.
2507;I highly recommend this movie.
2508;Great, interesting witty script, awesome animation and voices.
2509;This is one of the best movies ever!
2510;Cinderella and Snow White fighting for the wedding bouquet.
2511;It's Shrek, a a wonderful animated film that, among his many surprises, mocks classic fairytales.
2512;guard castle so she can marry Farquaad.
2513;there's nothing sweet in Shrek, a fabulous parody of fairytales.
2514;But the best animation wouldn't have made Shrek a success if it wasn't for his original story and fresh characters.
2515;Shrek is now and will always be an all time classic years from now when my children have children of their own someday they will be watching shrek.
2516;The wonderful thing about Shrek he never changes his love for himself and for others will always be a message that he will send to people of all walks of life.
2517;The picture was perfect, and we enjoyed the movie.
2518;We really like Amazon instant video, we use it often, great service!
2519;Kids my age (8) will probably love it so next time you'll see some good votes!
2520;What in the world is so hilarious about passing gas, for crying out loud, besides it being utterly embarrassing?
2521;As for story, I've actually found the story in """"Final Fantasy"""" to be more touching and more involving than the story of """"Shrek""""."""
2522;It is hard to follow, but it introduces a level of intrigue that makes it more interesting.
2523;If you can actually understand the story clearly, then it actually feels far more powerful than what you would originally think.)
2524;Not exactly deep, but definitely a lot of fun.
2525;Good characters, good humor, happy ending, family friendly: overall good movie.
2526;This uproarous animated hit is an instant computer animated classic, bigger and better than Toy Story.
2527;Even adults will fall for this summer hit!
2528;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy add their voice talent to this pleasant surprise!
2529;Even if you aren't a fan of Mike Myers, this is a very cute and extremely hilarious film.
2530;And later you'll be humming On The Road Again.
2531;I've lent it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it and so far everyone loves it!
2532;The animation is superb,the story well.
2533;written and the songs are unforgettable.You'll crack up at the little jokes in the movie,and there's a good lesson to learn:Don't judge others by the way they look.
2534;this movie is a wonderful film that will continue to entertain young and old alike!
2535;Shrek is the newest animated film from Dreamworks Pictures and PDI animation studio.
2536;Mike Myers is the voice of the ogre misanthrope, Shrek.
2537;Shrek makes an agreement with Lord Farquaad to go and rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon so Farquaad can marry her and become a real king.
2538;human ability at one point.
2539;The film is full of anachronisms such as recent pop music tunes and numerous references to TV with applause and laugh signs.
2540;There are turnstiles and an abandoned Disney.
2541;Robin Hood and his merry men make an appearance and he's French.
2542;By doing so it only succeeds in illustrating how far superior the characters and story telling are in Disney's animated features.
2543;This is a fine moral to impart to youngsters but the characters in the film make fun of Lord Farquaad height every chance they get.
2544;It's beautifully animated and rendered.
2545;The scenic environments and main characters are great to look at but this is one of the few redeeming qualities that keeps the movie from getting an even lower score that I'm going it give it.
2546;Perhaps if you're a youngster you'll find this film more enjoyable that I did.
2547;This movie will be a classic.
2548;The story is great with incredible voice acting by Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.
2549;The visuals are are spectacular!
2550;wow, this movie is getting great reviews.
2551;A great kid movie is usually enjoyable for adults, too.
2552;This animated tale of a giant green ogre living in the swamps of Never Neverland remains one of my favorite films of the genre.
2553;"Joining ""Toy Story"" of a couple years earlier, animated filmmakers began to make movies that would keep the youngsters entertained as well as mom and dad."
2554;Aiding Shrek on his quest is Donkey (a very very funny Eddie Murphy).
2555;The kids will love this movie and there are plenty of inside jokes that will be recognized by the adults.
2556;"And where else will you hear a beautiful rendition of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" sung by John Cale?"
2557;This is such a cute movie.
2558;i must have seen it a zillion times and can continue to watch it again and again.
2559;I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, so did my husband.
2560;one scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess!
2561;It is a faboulous movie for the whole family and everything about it is cool!
2562;it is a great movie about anogre, Shrek(Mike Myers) who is sent by evil lord Farquaad(John Lithgow) to save fiesty prince Fiona(Cameron Diaz) It hasa large selection of bonus features (A Big fat 11 hours!)
2563;Shrek is without a doubt one of the most fresh and original films to come along in a long while.
2564;The thought of turning those classics on their ears with a comic twist is enough to entice many of us to see Shrek, even if only out of curiosity.
2565;the story, like most great animated features, is pretty simple, but with added intrigue.
2566;Because of Lord Farquaad, all the fairytale creatures have been banished to Shrek (the Ogre)'s swamp.
2567;(see the movie to learn more :.)
2568;Even the background characters such as the Gingerbread Man are a hoot.
2569;From the Fantastic computer animation that just makes you say WOW to wonderful Fairytale surroundings, Shrek is an instant classic that kids adults alike will be watching for decades to come.
2570;A very cute scene is added at the very end of the movie (after all the credits have finished) that is just hilarious!
2571;The Tech of Shrek: a small look behind the creation of the revolutionary visual computer anmimation, is quite interesting.
2572;Dreamworks should take a look at the fun games Disney has been giving us, namely Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, which is a lot of fun.
2573;It's still very much worth it!
2574;But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!
2575;It's been a while since I watched this movie at the cinemas, and I absolutely loved it then.
2576;Sure it's brilliant, but there are far better animated films out there, most of them including the words 'Toy' and 'Story'.
2577;however, let me go onto why this film is good!
2578;First of all, the voices are well chosen, with Eddie Murphy being completely hilarious in all of his scenes.
2579;There's also Mike Myers with a Scottish accent and the excellent Camerion Diaz, who just defies to be pigeon.
2580;On top of that there is superb animation, with the viewer being able to see every individual hair on the animals etc.
2581;The most important thing about this film though is the fact that it's very funny.
2582;It's even quite touching at the end, yet however much you might admire the ending, you can't help but wish that Cameron Diaz's character had remained pretty.
2583;however, definitely one to watch, for adults and children.
2584;And in appealing to both age groups it has certainly achieved something.
2585;Shrek is an excellent movie.
2586;it as great animation, funny jokes and keeps you entertained there was really no flaws in the movie.
2587;In the fine tradition of other great animatronic films like Toy Story, Antz and A Bug's Life, Shrek is another solid outing in this genre.
2588;This is such a great film from several perspectives.
2589;The story, while formulaic (beautiful princess that needs rescuing, an evil tyrant King, etc) this film combines all the elements of a great film: comedy (tons of it with Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy), action, and of course, the lovey.
2590;It also combines all the classic elements of a great fantasy (which this is): noble knights, dragons and other mythical creatures, action, adventure and yes, romance.
2591;Plus, the underlying theme of love, true love for that matter, is just such a great message.
2592;All in all, it's just a great story .
2593;"two elements that made this film so enjoyable for me was the open use of ""children's fantasy characters"" throughout the movie."
2594;These depictions alone made it a jewel for older people like myself who remember growing up hearing these stories.
2595;This also makes it a jewel for children of THIS generation.
2596;the other great element in this movie was the great chemistry between Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy.
2597;Murphy also seems to reprise his hilarity from his Mushu character from Mulan.
2598;It's a great way to spend a few hours, whether you're seeing it with your friends, your kids (definitely see this with the kids), your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse or your family.
2599;You'll be laughing the whole time.
2600;Shrek is at top notch entertaining film!
2601;The sequel is very funny too!
2602;I've been a big fan of computer animated films for a long time now, but I have to tell you that this movie blows it's predecessors AWAY!
2603;Toy Story 1 and 2 are fantastic!
2604;A Bug's Life is incredible!
2605;If you think it looks silly or ridiculous, or if you just don't like Mike Meyers or Eddie Murphy, PLEASE, I beg of you, DON'T let that keep you from seeing this masterpiece from a truly innovative studio .
2606;I consider this to be the best film of 2001.
2607;I took my nephews to see Shrek at the theater last summer and they absolutely loved it but much to my surprise I loved it too.
2608;This is the gift that everybody got for Christmas.
2609;"it is a beautifully written send up of Disney films, fairytales, and other movies, with so many clever visual and verbal jokes
2610;All of which adults (with a sense of humour) will love.
2611;It is a perfectly cast movie with Mike Myers voicing the mild.
2612;mannered ogre Shrek and Eddie Murphy in his best form for many a year as his sidekick donkey.
2613;It is absolutely the most amazing animated film I have seen since Snow White.
2614;The scene with Robin Hood in the forest is the best and the most hilarious.
2615;When I copped a look at the trailer for this film and gauged the humour would be thrown mostly at an adult audience, I thought great!
2616;all I need to do know is round up a few kids to go see it with, so my two watched and laughed so hard I had to tell my little bloke to keep it down.
2617;This fractured fairy tale was a delight from the beginning, it was constant whether you were laughing or just being amazed by the beauty of the animation, move over Disney there's a new crowd in town learn from this, it does not have to be all hearts and flowers to make a success.
2618;Lets have at least something based on life that we can all associate with, well done SHREK.
2619;Good for Movie night with Family or Friends.
2620;Very Nice Movie to have with movie if your collection with movies.
2621;On seeing the film I didn't find the first half very funny at all, but once the donkey is introduced with the hillarious voice over from Eddie Murphy the film actually is fun.
2622;Technically it's great no doubts there and the rest of the voice overs are good.
2623;but for me the stuff from PIXAR is still the best.
2624;The two Toy Story's and a Bugs Life are great to watch, very funny, action packed and overall great story telling.
2625;Shrek, an ogre, wants to be alone, or so he says.
2626;So he sets out to see Farquaad (the brilliant John Lithgow) so that he can have his home back.
2627;the voice work was just outstanding.
2628;I laughed at Donkey, fretted about the princess, and hissed every time I saw Farquaad, and cheered Shrek on.
2629;the animation is also spectacular.
2630;I was impressed by how distinct the facial expressions were.
2631;As well, the scenery was amazing.
2632;There's a great deal of adult humor in the film, actually.
2633;This film really is fun for the whole family.
2634;I truly enjoyed the film, could have done without some of the gross out jokes.
2635;Loved them making fun of Disney movies, even while being a Disney fan.
2636;Every time I watch Shrek I find something that I missed before and I enjoy the movie more.
2637;My 21 month old has picked Shrekn as her new favorite so I feel confident after 6 viewings in 4 days I can speak on this.
2638;this is a movie that pokes fun at Disney, has the fairy tale ending and shows that inner beauty is all that matters.
2639;i must say that the animation is wonderful"
2640;Shrek is a very nice animation that has very good effects.
2641;There are some musicals in this show that sound quite nice.
2642;I adored the animation, and found the graphics to be the best I've ever seen.
2643;What goes around, comes around.
2644;which brings you right back to the theme of the story, and ends with the orbital path of truth and love once again.
2645;Real life is tough enough.
2646;Unlike every other REMADE movie out there, Shrek is original and fun.
2647;Visuals and storyline (gee, what a novel concept, a story) are good.
2648;Clever script, great music, good moral message.
2649;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy bring these animated creatures to life.
2650;my husband, children, and I sit in front of the TV watching and I promise at the end when they are doing karaoke it makes me laugh like the very first time!This is one of the greatest animated movies out and anyone with children or kids at heart will enjoy this great movie!
2651;Now to the actual content of the movie.
2652;I saw it with her though, and was completely surprised!
2653;mill, and the actors seemed born to play their roles.
2654;Of course you know that Donkey is going to be quite a humorous character because of Eddie Murphy speaking him, but Mike Myers still becomes the real star of the movie.
2655;I enjoyed Princess Fiona because of her fiery self, and her independence.
2656;all in all this is a great movie, and I believe everyone would be better off seeing it.
2657;Lord Farquaad is handing out rewards to anyone who turns in a fairytale creature (i. e., the 7 dwarfs, the 3 bears, witches, talking donkeys.)
2658;While in the middle of dinner, Shrek has some uninvited guests, all of the fairy tale creatures.
2659;well, that's a good starter, anyways.
2660;Then it turned out to be an entertaining film that made me laugh at times.
2661;A good way to spend a few hours watching a movie!
2662;shrek will surprise you with its original story and memorable characters.
2663;Eddy Murphy, as Donkey is outstanding!
2664;Mike Meyers and Cameron Diaz contribute great performances as well.
2665;Very nice picture on our 52 television.
2666;The movie is absolutely flawless.
2667;It had kids and adults laughing.
2668;There are even adults eager to see this movie.
2669;Dreamworks did a great job with this movie, and could become the biggest movie of the year and surpass Pearl Harbor.
2670;If you havent seen this movie yet, you should see it.
2671;It brings back what moviegoing should be all about.
2672;what can i say about shrek?It's just a comfort movie and it's a good one at that.
2673;lovable and cuddly come to mind as adjectives.
2674;An imaginative tale has been given a surprisingly unimaginative treatment.
2675;Shrek is a nothing is what it seems at first kind of tale, with lots of delightful shredding of fairytale characters and conventions, so it may be worth the ticket price for that in spite of the director's failings.
2676;I loved this movie in English.
2677;Gearing up for part three, I decided to watch the original.
2678;This is an absolute joy to watch even after so much time has past.
2679;Great story for both young and old.
2680;Mike Myers is a comedic genius, Eddie Murphy is just hilarious and Lithgow is a priceless gem.
2681;I just thought the movie was great.
2682;Perfect funny love story line with mike myers and eddie murphy, great graphics, Just overall great movie.
2683;The spectacular animation, coupled with sharp wit and quick moving dialog, makes this feature a must.
2684;There are enough laughs for everyone, both young and old.
2685;Definitely one to take your children to see, but for the older child (over 9) only.
2686;Shrek is the best kind of a comedy.
2687;It rips on Disney big time, but that's one of its greatest treats.
2688;kingdom which bares a strange resembelence to Disney World, this movie understands the pleasure in a good ol fashion Mouse Bashing (and why not with the poorly made sequals Disney has been poping out with recently that insult their earlier masterpieces just to make some MORE money).
2689;"(well actually they touch on that joke again when the Donkey goes ""and I think Shrek means he thinks Lord something has a really small.)"
2690;Besides these jokes, everything else is perfectly fine for children who I'm sure have seen Disney movies and are perfectly capable of laughing at them.
2691;i personally found Shrek lovable.
2692;He's this old grouch, but it's so refreshing to see a hero in a animated movie with a temper.
2693;Many of his jokes would not be funny on paper, but are funny because Eddie Murphy is a comical genius.
2694;"Ex: ""I like that boulder."
2695;"That is a nice boulder"" The princess is sassy, and adds heart to this feature."
2696;The Lord guy has some great visual gags, although the gingerbread man really stole a lot of scenes from him.
2697;Shrek needed a plot twist.
2698;It concentrates on laughter, jokes and being a funny movie (which it is).
2699;"The look on Shrek's face after the ""It's a Small World"" number."
2700;as for Murphy and Diaz, this is the best movie from either of them in a long while.
2701;The eagerness of the Donkey fits nicely with Murphy's talents.
2702;the true joy for me in Shrek were the (fractured) fairy tale references and the subtle (and not.
2703;Shrek is a funny, funny movie.
2704;I know I'll be watching this one again.
2705;i give Shrek my heartfelt recommendation.
2706;But, this journey gives Shrek a lot more than he EVER bargained for: friends, introspection, and love!!!
2707;I love this movie and I love that my kids love this movie!
2708;during the day she is a beautiful princess .
2709;She is mortified by this and tries to keep it a secret, but by the end of the movie she realizes that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but it truly is what lies within.
2710;I love that the movie sends this message out to young girls .
2711;rom has a really fun feature for kids that lets them dub their voices to the characters lines exactly!
2712;It keeps kids entertained for hours!
2713;There aren't may films that are as entertaining as this one for kids or for adults.
2714;the kids will love the comic like storyline and will recognise the fairytale characters throughout the film, the adults will remember the nursery rhymes of old .
2715;and anjoy the satirical humour .
2716;If I dropped one donkey you wouldn't be living!This has to be one of the funniest and best made films of all time, a future classic.
2717;older kids still love it!
2718;For me the technical part was the most interresting but everything else was really entertaining and fun.
2719;What a great effort .
2720;not only cutting edge CGI with authentic hair (the holy grail of computer graphics, so I'm told by my techno.
2721;friends), but it's very very funny.
2722;Mike Myers manages to play it almost completely straight (super Scottish accent though!)
2723;And a great cameo from the three cockney blind mice.
2724;But it's so much fun, so energetic, and the computer generated animation looks so good, that I suppose it can be grudgingly forgiven a few excesses.
2725;but for all the snarky humor, the Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy antics, and the impressive technology, the most delightful irony is that movie ends up working because of the way it taps into classic themes.
2726;Together they learn timeless lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and the true nature of beauty.
2727;i very much like the poetic justice of the filmmakers retreat.
2728;The end did give a strong positive message.
2729;that was the best piece in the whole movie!
2730;It seems I was enjoying the movie more than her smiles.
2731;After all there is still that innocence, beauty or goodness in all our hearts.
2732;I downloaded this video to entertain my toddler while flying on the plane.
2733;Shrek is good, but when the cat joins the cast it becomes hilarious.
2734;A funny version of Beauty and the Beast whose the beauty and whose the beast.
2735;This movie makes me laugh so hard everytime I see it.
2736;The dancing sequences are the best.
2737;The Frist Shrek Movie is simply excellent and a lot of fun to watch.
2738;animation sure come a long way.
2739;so Life like and real with the characters as well as the background.
2740;the humor is simply funny.
2741;this 2 disc verison is a treat with one disc has Widescreeen while the other is full screen plus the bonus features are simply wonderful to watch and so interesting.You have a goodtime with this frist Shrek movie.
2742;Such a cute movie for all ages.
2743;One of the few words he can say.
2744;This was a great price so I got two copies.
2745;star cast is humor at its best, family friendly and one can watch over and over again, and still enjoy !
2746;This is a terrific movie to watch when life seems tough and you're feeling sorry for yourself.
2747;I also like the film's basic messages.
2748;Smart people roll with the punches and make lemonade from the lemons.
2749;Shrek has been hyped to death and won the first ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.
2750;Mike Myers is great fun as Shrek, the ogre with the Greta Garbo complex, whose quiet existence in his swamp is disrupted by Lord Farquaad, voiced in hissably evil style by John Lithgow, who has evicted all the local fairy.
2751;Shrek and his unwelcome new side.
2752;all well and good, and lot's of fun is to be had by all.
2753;also, a great deal of the humor in this film comes from the skewering of Mouse, Inc., not that there's anything wrong with lampooning Mickey and Co.
2754;"despite these flaws and cautions, ""Shrek"" is a whole lot of fun."
2755;Eddie Murphy steals the show as Donkey.
2756;Mike Myers gives Shreck a Scottish accent, and Cameron Diaz has fun with her role of Princess Fiona.
2757;"i reccomend this film despite the flaws, as the fun factor for ""Shrek"" is as big as an ogre."
2758;But its funny and cute for kids.
2759;It was Cinderella and Hunchback rolled into one with a happy ending.
2760;My little girls loved it.
2761;This is one of my favorite movies because there is so much humor like how annoying Donkey is to Shrek!
2762;The video was shipped and received as promised and in the condition promised.
2763;"Thanks for making my ""shopping"" experience a happy one."
2764;Well, I had the most enjoyable movie experience I've had in a very long time.
2765;The movie was clever and entertaining at all age levels.
2766;The moral of the story was a learning experience for everyone.
2767;Thumbs up for a future move classic.
2768;I was highly disappointed after hearing how wonderful this film is.
2769;The animation was wonderful, and the voices were superb!
2770;One last thing that is interesting: my 13.
2771;The animation is superb and the color saturation on this pressing is just great.
2772;The DTS encoded soundtrack is marvelous.
2773;And this just might be Eddie Murphy's best performance ever!
2774;Treat yourself, it sure beats Geraldo talking about Anthrax.
2775;Shrek strarted out really funny.
2776;The humans try and catch the donkey, but Shrek is right there and they are scared and run away.
2777;The donkey and Shrek eventually become friends ( even after Shrek repeated many times to the donkey that he wasn't looking for any friends).
2778;well the movie was still pretty good, and I recommend you to see it.
2779;Well I saw this picture with a 4 kids ages 7.15 and found it funny but kind of predictable picture.
2780;The animation is done quite well and the individual performances were all rather humerous.
2781;The plot was kind a very basic fairy tale with the basic fairy tale ending (with a tiny twist).
2782;The kids will laugh and the grownups (who this movie is really for.)
2783;will smile at the inside jokes.
2784;There's humor and a story for both the young and the old.
2785;The story is great for kids and the humor and references to old walt.
2786;It's a really excellent movie.
2787;yr old daughter likes it so much that she watches it almost every day since I brought her to the movie then bought a video of the movie for her about one month ago.
2788;A first viewing is pure entertainment.
2789;Subsequent viewings reveal how truly outstanding the screenwriters are with their sly presentation of story, characters, and settings.
2790;"I might have missed ""Shrek"" if it weren't an absolute favorite of my grandson, and am so happy that I didn't."
2791;I confess to watching it even when he isn't visiting and marvel at the fact that I find something new each time we watch it.
2792;"The actors voicing the parts are perfection, and Eddie Murphy was robbed when he didn't receive an Oscar for his ""Donkey"" role."
2793;But after that,you'll see it my way.
2794;This is a wonderful family movie with lots of laughs, action, great animation, cool soundtrack, and so much fun!
2795;This is a wonderful movie.
2796;Well I have seen this twice in the theaters and was good enough to pay for twice, and I'd watch it again because it has intelligent comedy.
2797;lots of references to things we know, things we've read, and fairytales we grew up with.
2798;Its a very funny movie when it seems that the only comedies being made are insult our intelligence like Corky Romano or Deuce Bigalow etc. so its good to see that there are some people out there trying to avoid the same 'ol, ha.
2799;ha slapstick and challenge the viewers a bit.
2800;and with superb animation and witty comedy, you get a great movie for everyone to see.
2801;i would recommend this for young children.
2802;The movie is mostly an original concept but there are striking similarities to Antz.
2803;overall a GREAT movie for the whole family!
2804;with true love right in front of shrek the big ogre doesn't know how to react.
2805;This movie was one of the best I've seen in a while.
2806;It was funny and it kept moving.
2807;The music was entertaining too, and it fit with the scenes, which doesn't always happen.
2808;"A few things to keep in mind
2809;All in all this is a great movie that I highly suggest seeing.
2810;There was so much comedy, and the story was so entertaining.
2811;The characters were memorable, and each had something to offer.
2812;For example, Shrek offered his loner personality, and yet, showed feelings for the brave and independant Princess Fiona.
2813;Donkey is yet another comical character that deserves a lot of credit!
2814;I think he is the best character I've ever seen Eddie Murphy play.
2815;The setting of the movie was interesting and original, too: A medieval fairy.
2816;Like I said, though, I think it's hilarious, and worth a watch.
2817;The added features, games, etc., have got to be the best I've seen so far!
2818;I love all the characters and stars who provided voice.
2819;overs for the animation but I have to say that the Donkey/Eddie Murphy definately made the movie!Great fun, great laughs and lot's of enjoyment!
2820;I highly recommended this for your collection .
2821;Shrek is one of the best animated features to come along in a very long time (and I say this as a huge fan of Disney).
2822;It provides excellent entertainment for all ages.
2823;Dreamworks did an amazing job of bringing together big talent for such a piece of animation .
2824;Mike Myers is outstanding as Shrek (as usual) and Eddie Murphy is a hoot.
2825;John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz are excellent additions to the cast.
2826;It is still possible to be funny without being vulgar.
2827;All the anticipation, the longing, it could never be justified by a movie, even one that looked as good as Shrek (usually they put all the good parts in the trailer).
2828;on the morning of the 18, as I took of work just to see Shrek at the earliest possible showing, I was overjoyed to find along with a tale for kiddies, Shrek was filled with humor itended for adults.
2829;this parody of all the wonderful Disney movies truly broke the mold, and I give it a full two thumbs up and a solid 10.0!
2830;This is definitely a MUST SEE!
2831;If you're looking for a good laugh, Shrek is definetly the movie for you.
2832;Mike Myers delivers once again with his hysterical scottish accent, and Eddie Murphy is his usual funny self.
2833;I found the movie very enjoyable.
2834;It's got just the right mix of disney.
2835;chock full of extra features for your enjoyment.
2836;This movie was so witty, and so smart .
2837;just make sure that you see it!
2838;It's fun for all ages!
2839;Besides being hilarious, the plot is actually pretty cute too, and all the fairy tale creatures living in a modern times kind of world was pretty interesting.
2840;In a few years High Definition widescreen TV will be a significant presence.
2841;Dream Works is is looking for a piece of he giant pie.
2842;The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs.
2843;I loved everything about this movie.
2844;It was by far the best animation that I have seen in a long long time.
2845;I will go back at least one or two more times to see it again.
2846;I love it and I hope that It will win next year at The Academy Awards.
2847;Eddie Murphy was as cute as a Donkey.
2848;Thanks so much for making such a wonderful movie, not just for kids, but for the adults also.
2849;This was an excellent movie.
2850;It was so hilarious and my kids loved it.
2851;I must agree some of the humor was a little potty mouth for some of the younger kids, but it was still a great movie.
2852;It was good to see a movie so funny and entertaing(from a computer animated standpoint).
2853;WARNING : I give away the ending of this film.
2854;so she and Shrek fall in love, he kisses her.
2855;If they really, truly love each other, WHY can't Fiona keep the face and form she was BORN to have.
2856;Adults are allowed to just enjoy themselves and have fun with 'eye candy' TV shows and films, or beach novels.
2857;and I think it is quite appropriate to question just what message it sends.
2858;We seemed to have lost ours and this was a good price so we got it.
2859;Hands down the best computer animated film ever made.
2860;You cared for the characters and it was very funny.
2861;this movie is, by all means, absolutely hilarious.
2862;there are numerous clever scenes, among them the evil Lord Faarquad's interrogation of the gingerbread man.
2863;this is a must see movie, and an instant classic that isn't too childish for adults to enjoy, and at the same time isn't beyond the grasp of children.
2864;but maybe I'll eventually be happy that we can watch it offline.
2865;I simply loved this movie.
2866;It's so well done that you forget that the heroes are not real but computer made !
2867;You'll laugh and even share a few tears with them !
2868;I saw it in French and will go back for the Original version.
2869;Good and funny clean movie.
2870;It is good for the whole family and kids.
2871;SHREK obviously has received a lot of praise from movie critics and audiences world.
2872;I have to say that as hilarious as it is, SHREK was not the best film I've ever seen.
2873;I have to say that I enjoyed exploring all the special features more than the movie itself!
2874;The computer animation of the film is pretty well.
2875;And the voice performances are one of the best parts of the film!SHREK stars Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek.
2876;a giant, friendly ogre, Eddie Murphy as the voice of Donkey.
2877;scenes to the world of Shrek.
2878;the fact that characters from various fairy tales kept appearing was highly amusing to both my husband and I.
2879;Finally, we found another movie we could both enjoy.
2880;In his attempt to get Lord Farquaad to allow the characters to return to their homes, he finds a new purpose and mission.
2881;the fact that this animation also included a dragon and a princess in a castle tower was just so perfect.
2882;Everything was spectacular as far as the animation went and I was especially impressed with the castles and molten lava.
2883;Shrek also has a wonderful Scottish accent.
2884;Pity, this could have been a really good family film and it brings out various aspects I thought could be great lessons for kids.
2885;My nephew brought this over one night and begged to watch it.
2886;This is a great movie that sort of throws all the other classic tales out the window.
2887;Involved in the story are Shrek, his donkey, a man wanting to be king, and a princess named Fiona.
2888;At the marriage ceremony, the secret is reveiled and Fiona and Shrek live together, happily ever after, of course.
2889;This movie is excellent sarcastic and cute at the same time.
2890;The Gingerbread man and Pinnochio are the best characters in the entire movie!
2891;Oh yeah and of course the rest of the cast were awesome"
2892;i thought it was cleverly crafted with fairytale tickles just go and see it a couple of times and have a good laugh
2893;This movie is the best Dreamworks movie.
2894;There is humor in this movie for all ages!
2895;This movie is visually appealing.
2896;I enjoyed watching it for not only its humorous story, but also for its music, and I am a big fan of Mike Myers!Children will love this movie trust me.
2897;I watched it 3 times in a row because they love it so much.
2898;"A fractured fairy tale if there ever was one, ""Shrek,"" directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is a highly imaginative, animated comedy that has something in it for everyone."
2899;It's funny, witty, at times gross, while at other times, poignant.
2900;besides the humor, the wide appeal of this movie is due in part to the many clever references to other movies, stories and cultural icons it incorporates so well into the story.
2901;There's a scene that fans of professional wrestling will get a hoot out of, and the scene involving Princess Fiona and Robin Hood and his dancing band of Merry Men is beyond hilarious.
2902;There is some bathroom humor, as well, but it's fairly brief and inoffensive.
2903;the actors supplying the voices do a great job, especially Mike Myers who brings Shrek so vividly to life, complete with a Scottish accent.
2904;Murphy has some great lines as the donkey and makes the most of them, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect, as is Lithgow as Lord Farquaad.
2905;The use of music in this film is exceptional, also.
2906;A number of familiar, popular songs are integrated into the story and the action to great effect throughout, and repeatedly, the filmmakers seemed to have an innate sense of knowing just the right song to plug into any particular moment or scene.
2907;As with virtually everything else about this movie, it all came together beautifully.
2908;"In the final analysis, ""Shrek"" is an innovative, entertaining movie for the whole family that is guaranteed to keep you laughing and smiling for a lot longer than the 89 minutes it's on the screen."
2909;It's the magic of the movies.
2910;Quite possibly the best movie of 2001.
2911;leather fairly tale will make you smile, laugh out loud, maybe shed a tear, and clap your hands together at the end.
2912;Mike Myers does the best job of voice since Tom Hanks did Woody in Toy Story .
2913;Instantly likable as the ogre Shrek .
2914;his wit and subtle humor is drawn out by the fast talking donkey (also played to a tee by Eddie Murphy).
2915;Check out all the Disney characters and listen to the funny remarks that are said about them.
2916;Donkey: I'm a donkey on the edge!
2917;the donkey had so many great lines .
2918;Also note a great time had by the entire cartoon cast singing I'm A Believer (made famous by the Monkees) at the conclusion.
2919;excellent widescreen visual effects, sound music.
2920;Great extras as well .
2921;film featurettes commentaries, interactive games, karaoke, fun facts and technical goofs.
2922;And as a Mom of course I love the children's movie and watch some of them more than they do.
2923;Yes there is adult humor.
2924;and yes it was a funny movie.
2925;First time I have watched it.
2926;It was a good movie that was pretty funny.
2927;The PG rating is appropriate and you need to make a good judgement for your children.
2928;GREAT WRITING, vivid characters, bang.
2929;formula story that hits home with viewers of all ages.
2930;'Shrek' is a fabulous movie.
2931;I found myself laughing along with my kids throughout the movie.
2932;It also contains a subtle subplot of accepting yourself for who you really are.
2933;She laughed watching the movie and laughed watching my kids laugh.
2934;This is the 1st great movie of the summer.
2935;Animation fans rejoice with this blockbuster from Dreamworks that is basically a re.
2936;work of Beauty and the Beast.
2937;It is a wonderful reworking without the Disney schmaltz (and also minus the incredible songs).
2938;The voice talent is amazing with Eddie Murphy (as the donkey companion to Shrek) practically stealing the show from Mike Myers (voicing Shrek).
2939;Cameron Diaz is wonderful as Fiona the beautiful princess (and a whole lot more).
2940;John Lithgow is splendid as the king wannabe Farquad.
2941;The film is awash in funny lines to fabulous jokes at the expense of Disney Films.
2942;It is also incredibly charming (if slightly predictable).
2943;Great for small children, older kids and the whole darn family!!
2944;If you want to watch this beautifully.
2945;I watched it again after enjoying it in the theatre twice when it came out and was pleased to discover that it not only looks remarkably clear but remains as funny today as the first time.
2946;"Amid the layered humor and references to various fairy tales, ""Shrek"" has a message about judging people based on their hearts rather than their appearances that works for kids and adults alike."
2947;If you haven't seen it in a while, see it again.
2948;This is great movie for the family, it has a wonderful soundtrack as well.
2949;The best of all worlds.
2950;Plot as good or better than any disney classic, but jazzed up to be a film for a new generation.
2951;the whole family enjoyed it and look forward to seeing the next one this weekend!
2952;Dreamworks does it great again
2953;Even though much of the humor is over their heads, it is appropriate for young kids and is something the whole family can watch together.
2954;It is a must see.
2955;In viewing Disk 2 of the Two.
2956;while I absolutely love the original Shrek, my great joy in viewing the widescreen version of any movie is seeing all of the image that was originally shot.
2957;It is my hope that IF they ever re.
2958;"It also has one of the finest endings in modern filmmaking, but by the time you get there, that's almost beside the point
2959;He's big, green, and scares the natives.
2960;Just combine the usual saving.
2961;prince fairytale (where your hero isn't Prince Charming) and you've got a good idea of what's going on.
2962;The ending, while somewhat surprising at first blush, is also pretty standard fairytale fare.
2963;What separates Shrek from the usual fairytale fare, and makes it equally palatable to adults and kids, is that preternatural combination of adult.
2964;friendly animation that, while still too rarely seen, is starting to become more common.
2965;Hopefully, it'll be this good.
2966;This is one of the best realized two.
2967;level films that I have seen, rivalling even that of Sesame Street and its wonderful double entendres.
2968;It is a masterpiece that will become a classic like Pinocchio.
2969;The hilariously perverse answer to the entire Disney fairy.
2970;Considering the fact that Jeffrey Katzenberg, the """"K"""" in the still."""
2971;"albeit one that is full of adult humor with a definite ""Saturday Night Live"" sensibility to it."
2972;Anyone who wonders how an ogre with a Scottish brogue ended up with the name Shrek, here's your answer: Originally, Shrek was a German.
2973;"with Smashmouth's hit song ""All Star"" playing in the background!"
2974;whose life he saves, and who is voiced by an irrepressable Eddie Murphy (who also gives one of the most inspired comedic performances of his own career).
2975;Chances are, you have probably seen this incredibly rude and hilarious film more times than I have.
2976;So have your kids, I'm sure.
2977;day opening record for any film.
2978;that's right, beating even the revered recent film made by Mel Gibson!
2979;It's an amazing film in its own right, but I'll get to reviewing it in a minute.
2980;Shrek is very funny, and is probably the best movie I've seen this year.
2981;"The extra features are also very fun including two short documentaries (together equal apx 1 hr)
2982;An added plus is disc 1 has the full.
2983;frame version, and disc 2 has the widescreen version.
2984;then you can have your cake and eat it too.
2985;While TOY STORY and the other Pixar films had been first rate and enormously entertaining, they were still primarily targeted at children.
2986;The humor appeals to kids, but has more of an adult sophistication.
2987;the movie contains more wonderful moments of parody than in any other animated film.
2988;The pastiche on Robin Hood (voiced by the French actor who played the bad guy in BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF) was superb, as was the brief take off on THE MATRIX during that sequence.
2989;Lord Farquaad's Dulac definitely is a parody of Disneyland, and there are scores of take offs on a variety of """"Fairyland Creatures."""""""
2990;And while the figures all move a little stiffly, their appearance is a huge leap forward for CGI animation.
2991;I'm sure they will fix it eventually, but the teeth need to look a heck of a lot more natural than they already do.
2992;over artists, or as well done by a score of other performers.
2993;Like many fans of the film, I am delighted that all four principles.
2994;This will definitely be one of the films of 2004 that I will be looking most excitedly towards.
2995;Shrek is a fantastic Movie!!
2996;Its great when she discovers that she toois a Troll.
2997;And it got two thumbs up from the two guys who rate movies!
2998;Shrek is a great movie .
2999;If you're looking for a fun movie (one that you'll enjoy as much as the kids), this is a great choice.
3000;Looking for a family film in the best sense of the word?
3001;"SHREK, the most successful film of the year (so far pre ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"") brings to life a surrealistic, three dimensional world inhabited by all manner of extreme but believable characters with their own, very human, problems and agendas."
3002;Eddie Murphy is consistently in the zone as the up.
3003;"But the most interesting thing that looms over this film about self acceptance is the personal war between Disney's Michael Eisner and DreamWorks' ""Shrek"" producer Jeffrey Katzenberg."
3004;The rivalry and bitterness between the two former Disney associates has resulted in several extraordinary animated products that are probably much better than they might have been.
3005;"Let's hope they keep competing on a personal level because ""Shrek"" is just about perfect."
3006;And that's the politically correct ending.
3007;I wasn't too sure that I was going to enjoy this movie, and I grudgingly went along.
3008;I was very surprised by it.
3009;It does a fantastic job of mixing humor for both kids and adults.
3010;The kids will enjoy some of the more obvious humor while the adults will get a kick out of the more subtle jokes.
3011;A vane Lord, who seems to have an unexplained problem with fairy tales, wants to become the perfect King.
3012;But a man of his stature can't do this, so he enlists Shrek, a local Ogre.
3013;Through all the jokes and fun, a simple love story appears, and the movie carries a very good moral.
3014;Casting was excellent, in both the major and minor characters.
3015;Kids and adults should have no problem enjoying this movie together, as evidenced by the fun and laughter in the theatre that I was in.
3016;shrek is a definitely best movie about love i ever see.
3017;burst of laughter came out of my mouth and i even f. d. yes shrek and princess will stay together.
3018;they will wake up to each other every day of their life.
3019;as for the film, Shrek is a funny, smart and wicked look at fairy tales, with the ocassional pun on Disney.
3020;check out the grass, the trees, the pouring of milk, the beer mud and the hair on the donkey, all truly amazing.
3021;the voice talent is also quite good, with an outstanding performance by Eddie Murphy.
3022;this takes up a lot of memory so two discs are needed.
3023;Finally, the documentary 'The tech of Shrek' is probably the best extra for the grownups or for people interested in the process of making such a film (check out the screen they had made up as a forest hut, with trees, rocks and whatnot, cool!)
3024;Shrek is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.
3025;"For while it is sardonic, ""Shrek"" is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one."
3026;The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily.
3027;Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.
3028;"it is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of ""Shrek."""
3029;Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.
3030;Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in.
3031;"Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in ""Aladdin."
3032;So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go.
3033;(The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).
3034;"despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, ""Shrek"" is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times."
3035;The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.
3036;In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter.
3037;fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.
3038;special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well.
3039;delineated animated characters to life on the screen.
3040;"in every area of the filmmaking process, ""Shrek"" excels like no general audience film since ""Toy Story 2."""
3041;"Like that earlier work, ""Shrek"" provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed."
3042;Shrek is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.
3043;Be sure to catch it.
3044;It wasn't as good as I heard it would be, but I liked it overall.
3045;Is there a good message?
3046;Oh, shut up and see it.
3047;It was in the really good shape and I received it in a timely manner.
3048;I was real pleased with the service.
3049;Mike Myers is Shrek, an Ogre who finds he has a heart of gold.
3050;Shrek strikes a deal with the would.
3051;shrek has a simple story, with a simple message .
3052;That said, this is a great flick because of the talent .
3053;"the kingdom of Du Loc bares a facial resemblance to Disneyworld, complete with gift shops and, my favorite bit, an automated info booth obviously patterned on ""It's a Small World""."
3054;Shrek is a fairy tale, good for kids (who may miss most of the references) but aimed at grown.
3055;The originality and the story is solid.
3056;Defying every cliche, and somehow still retaining the sweetness and goodness all good fables should have, Shrek is simply enchanting.
3057;The computer animation looks wonderful, and must be seen on a big screen .
3058;each created character comes to dazzling life.
3059;The story, which involved a disgruntled ogre, a tiny Lord, a donkey who talks, and a princess in need of rescue, takes more than a few knowing jabs at Disney characters/lore we have all come to know and love, and will surprise even the most sophisticated viewers.
3060;And kids will love the adventure of it all (though there are some truly frightening moments in the Dragon's Castle, for those younger, more impressionable tots).
3061;The voices, most notably the hilarious.
3062;loud Eddie Murphy as the Donkey, are wondrous, and are matched second.
3063;"This movie has more truly funny comic bits than any other release out there
3064;known pop music only adds to the charm and fun.
3065;The movie is sentimental and sweet.
3066;I loved """"The Princess Bride"""" and how it mocked the standard fairy tale in a way that both crucified the genre and honored it."""
3067;It made fun of the frivolousness of the tales, but still also offered an experience that rivaled even the best traditional fairy tales.
3068;"It was also a ""family"" movie and it managed at times to capture the grandeur of a fairy tale through the emotional attachment."
3069;A good story has to at least hit us on an emotional level.
3070;The score itself was moving enough to be worthy of a serious dramatic tale.
3071;"So ""Shrek"" winds up a mix of humor for adults with a (.)"
3072;my kids are pretty well grown now and I remember that we used to take them to the movies regularily.
3073;this movie at least is presented in such a way that its a pleasure for all to take a monet with the kids to watch and laugh.
3074;What a great story .
3075;And enjoy it I did.
3076;Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy are terrific.
3077;Set in a strange, colorful land populated by fairy tale characters, SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike.
3078;On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realizing that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be.
3079;Reinventing the traditional fairy tale adventure, SHREK features gorgeous computer animation, a unique sense of humor, and compelling characters.
3080;Still the documuntry is worth it, but the Karokee Dance Party were the cast sings varouis songs is great.
3081;One of the best films out there in theaters now!
3082;It's packed with laughs that would even entertain, not only a child, but an adult!
3083;He's fast, and has a big mouth, that might irritate you at times, or make your crack a large smile.
3084;Feeling excitement for this film, and finding out the truth of the princess at the end, makes everything worth your visit.
3085;I love this movie and my kids do too!!
3086;The best thing about this movie is how CHEAP it was!
3087;movie last night, and this is one movie I actually LOVE.
3088;it is simply amazing what they did with this movie.
3089;This movie must be rated movie of the year.
3090;I gave this movie 5 stars because it was a great film, very funny, and just all around pretty cool.
3091;Right now, and probably for a while, this is my favorite movie!
3092;It was fun to watch with humor for all ages and lots of feel good moments.
3093;It is a very creative story with wonderful characters!
3094;It is an awesome move that my kids enjoy watching over and over.
3095;He assigns Shrek the quest of finding Princess Fiona, and in return Farquaad will return the swamp.
3096;shrek was hilarious, and thought.
3097;It was enjoyed by my Grandmother, 71, as well as my friend Monica.
3098;Even adults can watch and enjoy.
3099;Some strong language if you sensitive to that with your kids.
3100;Finally a movie that is just right!
3101;This movie is funny and enjoyable while kicking animation stereotypes out of its way.
3102;This movie is THE greatest, with a oger hero instead of the villian.
3103;bent on having a perfect kingdom.
3104;This film is great in that it throws way to many fast ones and never bothers to follow the rules!!!
3105;The vocalizations really make this movie.
3106;He winds out with Donkey as his companion on his quest, and to sum it up, it is laugh after laugh.
3107;Shrek is a hilarious movie never intended to send an important message, it just silly and fun.
3108;The Karaoke tune at the very end is a riot!!
3109;Besides, a good fart joke is fun, because farts are funny.
3110;My mouth was open and everything!
3111;my sister works at PDI whick works for Deamworks the CO. that made the fimle.
3112;so a got to see it be for it came out hehe.
3113;The animation is a couple of steps beyond what we have seen in Ants and A Bug's Life , Cameron Diaz is as hot here as anywhere.
3114;Otherwise the film is exceptionally funny, and works for both adults and kids.
3115;This is absolutely one of the best movies I've seen.
3116;a great story, good characters, hilarious comedy, and everyone in the family can enjoy it.
3117;This computer animated wonder is a great send.
3118;Shrek is a very cute movie.
3119;Cameron Diaz was very good as Princess Fiona.
3120;The animation is excellent, rivaling that of Disney/Pixar's Bug's Life.
3121;quite frankly I didn't think the movie was that funny.
3122;it was great having them look at me, confused about the movie ending so early.
3123;The special features alone make this worth owning, but when you get crystal clear images from the great digital movie, there's no topping this hilarious family adventure.
3124;here's the bottom line: 2 discs of games, information, fun new interviews of the characters and a longer ending/party, it's an uplifting, wholesome film.
3125;Based on a book, coincedence!It was a damn fine movie.
3126;And Eddie Murphey was perfect as the donkey.
3127;love is all there is, and Cameron Diaz turns into a real hottie.
3128;The answer to the question is that Shrek is one of a kind.
3129;Mike Myers is the voice behind the best.
3130;Shrek lives in a secluded area of the forest, but when Lord Farquaad resolves that all the fairy creatures need to live in this area, Shrek's peace is seriously affected.
3131;One day, he sees a regiment from the kingdom of Far Far Away capturing fairies.
3132;She is held hostage in a castle defended by a fierce dragon and many have succumbed in their rescue attempts.
3133;You can take a guess as to who the lucky winner is.
3134;this is not your typical fairy tale, and it is definitely intended for an audience a little more mature, but it is an enjoyable one.
3135;There is one word that defines this movie to the T: humor.
3136;The actors selected to give voice to the characters of Shrek (Myers), Lady Fionna (Cameron Diaz) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are perfect for their roles.
3137;The writers also did an excellent job in picking the jokes and the funny comments throughout the production are something to cherish.
3138;there is also a wide selection of extra features in the two.
3139;My favorite extra feature was the one that discusses the technical aspects of the animation, because this is one of the most amazing aspects of this film.
3140;I thought good movies were only true in fairy tales, meant for some.
3141;My four year old loved and laughed with this movie as much I did.
3142;The humour was great, animation amazing and voice acting seriously impressive.
3143;I have never seen so many fairy tale references/parodies before, and I loved it.
3144;I would have loved this movie if it weren't for the occasional bad words and adult humor.
3145;Everything about it was great.
3146;It's perfect for both kids and adults.
3147;The humor of this movie fits all ages.
3148;A quarter of the way through the movie you begin to forget that it's animated, then you are treated to a close up of Shrek and you can see everone of his PORES!
3149;The story has a good message of not judging someone based on appearances, but looking inside them.
3150;The performances are flawless and the theatre was laughing almost the entire time.
3151;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy have such great chemistry together, and Donkey is one of the greatest characters.
3152;This is a funny movie, and short enough to stay that way.
3153;Still, as a screenwriter, I like to see all that stuff, and there's some good material included along with the feature here.
3154;My wife, who dislikes animation, likes this film.
3155;I thought it was a really funny movie.
3156;The plot was cute, the animation was fantastic, and it was absoloutely hilarious.
3157;I really loved all the characters, especially the donkey.
3158;I think the people who made this movies had a good sense of humor and kids.
3159;Overall, I loved this movie and I reccomend it for everyone.
3160;I thought it was hilarious, as well as a wonderfully animated.
3161;I loved the fact that it brought in all the story book characters for my childhood and made them all a little kookie to boot.
3162;This is a movie that an entire family, from a 5 year old to a 50 year old can sit down and enjoy together.
3163;My girls and I watch this movie night after night and still find the humor, the love, and the adventure in it.
3164;i still enjoy a number of moments throughout the movie.
3165;This has got to be one of my favorite animated movies, up qith Antz, Beauty the Best and Mulan.
3166;I look for movies with strong female characters, or at least strong individuals.
3167;He ends up saving a beautiful princess in a tower.
3168;She likes his sense of humor and seems to be pretty laidback herself .
3169;I left the theater with a big smile on my face .
3170;I got this for my grand kids and they love it, in fact I love it too
3171;It'll give you a laugh and is cute for the kids too.
3172;I'd recommend it to anyone
3173;shrek is well animated, well written, and very well acted.
3174;It's absolutely hilarious at times, and very touching at others.
3175;Well, I love the movie it gives you some funny moments as well as the understanding that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
3176;What a great message to give to kids and grown ups alike.
3177;If it weren't for the profanity, I'd have given it 5 stars because it is a riot!
3178;This was a great choice in movie and seller.
3179;My grandson adores this movie, as well as the rest of the household.
3180;as this movie is aimed at a wide audience, I found enough to engross many children and enough to also engage an older crowd.
3181;all, Shrek was a well done movie with creative dialogue, beautiful scenes and an entertaining plot.
3182;I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys computer animated movies.
3183;Shrek is one of the greatest films of all time.
3184;My family loved it so much, that we've passed it on to even my grandmother!
3185;The simple jokes and allusions (especially to Lord Farquad's height) are creative and sly.
3186;You must see Shrek, whether you are a kid or an adult.
3187;Pokes fun at Disney, lots of adult humor, but good for kids of all ages.
3188;This movie is one of those instant classics that appeal to people of all ages.
3189;For the kids you have the amazing animation and fairy tail characters.
3190;For adults there is a wonderful story, fantastic characters, and of course those wonderful allusions (made famous in the Simpsons and Toy Story 1+2) that just go right over kids heads but will have you rolling with laughter.
3191;then animation and attention to detail in this film are nothing short of breathtaking.
3192;There are many times you will forget you are watching a computer.
3193;The characters are all brilliant but the Gingerbread Man and Eddie Murphy as the talking Donkey absolutely steal every scene they are in.
3194;If you loved the Toy Stories, or you are breathing, or you even have an ounce of a sense of humor then this movie is absolutely a must have.
3195;I still remember the first time I saw this.
3196;The title character, played by Mike Myers, is funny and although he is not a nice person at the beginning (being a stereotypical ogre), everyone likes him.
3197;People take one look at me and go 'Aah!
3198;Although she begins as a typical fairytale princess, she proves independent, fearless and skilled.
3199;She turns out to be the perfect match for Shrek.
3200;the villain, the dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is also very funny.
3201;The jokes, as I said, are hilarious, and the storyline is perfect.
3202;It's a parody of a fairytale, and works extremely well.
3203;Out of the four Shrek movies, this is probably the second best, close behind the second movie.
3204;"what fairy tale didn't have some prince with a superiority complex wanting to be king, and spotting a beautiful girl from across the room, and saying ""She's the one."""
3205;You NEVER see Prince Wonderful courting Lovely Lady around, do you?
3206;Shrek completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.
3207;Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).
3208;this movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time.
3209;This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way.
3210;The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great.
3211;i don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart.
3212;"Another great scene was the ""Merry Men"" singing their song, which turns into the suspended."
3213;"kick"" motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time."
3214;this was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story.
3215;I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL!
3216;This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.
3217;"See ""Shrek,"" you won't regret it!!"
3218;Superbly executed, another excellent work from DreamWork.
3219;Very witty (you will be amazed), nice voice by eddie Murphy, and gratifying graphics.
3220;The main plot was just like all the other save the princess movies, but this one had many interesting twists, the whole theater was laughing so wild all the time, it made me feel dizzy even now.
3221;I would say it was the best Carton of the year, and you definitely should bring your whole family to see it!
3222;as well as being quite sweet it contains some very funny jokes (there are some digs at the Disney studio, and a great sequence which spoofs The Matrix ).
3223;This film will entertain both adults and children though, as it works on two levels .
3224;the charming story is in its` own way a fairy tale, while also being a parody of more traditional fairy tale movies, poking fun at established characters.
3225;overall, I think this is an excellent movie .
3226;a cute plot combined with some great humor proves that cartoons aren`t only for kids.
3227;Whereas Pixar always focused on good, clean family fun in its pictures, Shrek came into the spotlight because Dreamworks decided to skew the jokes a little more towards the older audience, while maintaing the basic family.
3228;It worked, and Shrek was the film that proved it didn't take Disney/Pixar to create animated box.
3229;this first movie in the series still holds up well.
3230;Some of the pop culture jokes are instantly dated (this was done when everyone had to do a Matrix spoof), but others like the jabs at Disney are still hilarious.
3231;It helps that at its heart, Shrek still has all the usual fairy tale elements, albeit twisted.
3232;Myers, Diaz, and Murphy turn in top performances.
3233;"And some of the dialogue is quite memorable (""Ogres are like onions"")."
3234;It's still not a really loaded set, but it's good for a family release and worth looking into.
3235;When I first saw previews of Shrek, I compared it with a Disney.
3236;I avoided it at all costs.
3237;From then on, I ended up interested in it, enjoying it.
3238;I've been a fan of Disney movies for a long time, but this was so fresh and new.
3239;And the voice actors were wonderful for their parts!
3240;Beauty and the Beast, but just who is the Beast and who is Beauty?
3241;That's what's great, they are both the Beast and the Beauty.
3242;Nothing but laughter from beginning to end for me.
3243;Received the movie on time and in good condition.
3244;So now I'm good to go!
3245;Shrek is a great film for everyone.
3246;Kids will adore it and adults will love it as well.
3247;It has a great cast, with a fabulously witty story, and the right music at the right time.
3248;For its day (2001) the state of the art computer animation was brilliant.
3249;Funny, entertaining, and with an overall good message, the whole family enjoys it.
3250;I am huge Disney fan, and went into this movie not expecting to enjoy it nearly as much as I would have a Disney film, but my son wanted to see it, so I of course obliged.
3251;I was pleasantly surprised, and had no trouble adding this film to the presents under the Christmas tree.
3252;sherk is a ogre and a loner to the highest degree.
3253;He doesn't believe in fairy tales, and that point is made clear within the first 10 mintues of the film by a very outrageously funny scene in the out house.
3254;this is a film that the whole family can enjoy.
3255;It is laced with adult caliber humor that is easily hidden from the children in your company by making them laugh at the same time due to a facial expression or action placed at the same time as the witty remark.
3256;Adult humor geniously hidden in a children's animated comedy .
3257;reminds me of the old political Bugs Bunny cartoons because both are great fun for children AND adults alike.
3258;Definitely a 5 star production!
3259;(When I took my family to see this film at the theatre, our ages ranged from 68 to 7 years old.)
3260;It was like a trip to an amusement park but even more amusing.
3261;This work of art is hilarious!
3262;I didn't know a thing about the story and was pleasantly surprised and enthralled with the magic.
3263;Shrek is one of the few family movies I've seen that I can honestly say is intended for both adults and children.
3264;There are several jokes for the adults, but just as many jokes for the kids, and the whole moral behind Shrek is a good one.
3265;Eddie Murphy brings in a lot of comic relief to Donkey, John Lithgow adds the right amount of lordly overtone to Lord Farquaad, a pint sized man wanting the perfect kingdom, and Mike Meyers and Cameron Diaz give depth to Shrek and Princess Fiona.
3266;the references to other movies are humorous and well done, and the animation is outstanding.
3267;In some places the scenery looks almost real, and all the characters move like real people and animals would move.
3268;This is one of the few movies I can say I really loved, and if I had the time, I would see it many more times.
3269;It's nice to see a movie that's both funny and has a moral of some kind that can appeal to adults and children.
3270;Even though the donkey can be a bit of a drama queen (king)sometimes, the characters are generally good.
3271;Overall, I think it's a good movie.
3272;We bought Shrek for our grandkids for Christmas.
3273;and I enjoyed listening and seeing it each time.
3274;unlike some of the others that kids will play over and over, this one made me smile, laugh and almost cry over and over and over.
3275;This is a wonderfully innovative film the whole family will enjoy!
3276;With a surprising twist on the tried and true fairy tale formula, this funny and occasionally touching story about an ogre who just wants to be left alone is visually stimulating (for the kids), and entertaining and clever (for the teens and adults) enough to hold anyone's attention.
3277;I loved this movie, and I'm sure you will too!
3278;good packaginggreat printit was as good as an absoulutely new onethanks
3279;This has to be the best animated movie of all time, better then the Lion King, better than Snow White.
3280;All of the inuendoes to fairy tales and movies are great, esp.
3281;Dreamworks also continues on its track record of making movies with great and heartfelt stories.
3282;You can see the persona and attitudes of the characters change with the mood of the movie, from the funny scenes to the scene where the mood turns incredibly somber.
3283;The Smash Mouth songs also add a lot to the beginning and end of the movie as well.
3284;Everyone must see this movie!
3285;Lots of allusions to other movies.
3286;I've seen good movies, and Shrek is just not a good movie.
3287;Let's make a movie starring a kind.
3288;hearted but misunderstood hero with a witty, flippant sidekick!
3289;Oh wait, it has, but that's ok, because we're satirizing Disney!
3290;I guess in the 21st century, jokes about bodily functions count as wit and attitude.
3291;But we have to make sure the movie succeeds: follow the standard cartoon movie story.
3292;Oh, we also have to make sure we don't offend anyone: Give it four or five passes through the political correctness machine.
3293;Restrained and subdued in a strange way, like the rest of the movie, but still funny.
3294;And Mike Myers does a decent job with the Scottish accent.
3295;"The Bourbon Chicken place at my local food court has a sign above it that reads: ""It's not spicy!"
3296;shrek is one of the best movies around.
3297;The spoofs create an atmosphere of fun, remembrance of youth, and fantasy of kid stuff that makes for a great family experience.
3298;The added bloopers of animation errors are hilarious!
3299;Eddie Murphy almost steals the spotlight in his highly entertaining voice of the donkey and Mike Myers does an equally good job of Shrek, an ogre, the main character of the film.
3300;The humour in this movie provides so many laughs and some of the jokes couldn't possibly have been aimed at children as they are often very mature and subtle!!
3301;The animation is fantastic and the cameos from favourite nursery rhymes/children's stories make the movie even more interesting for children!!
3302;"It has a wonderful musical repertoire of remakes of old songs as well as brand new ones including ""I'm a Believer"" by Smash Mouth."
3303;the music in this movie will have you up dancing and to have it sung and performed by animated characters will bring laugter all around!All up, this movie offers great animation of loveable characters, entertainment for both the kids and adults, catchy music that will have you dancing and humour that will being tears to your eyes.
3304;It was a wonderful story about storybook love with a twist.
3305;the best part about this movie is that you as an adult won't be bored with it.
3306;The children are entertained by the colors and the simple storyline, and you are entertained by the music and ALL of the jokes.
3307;IT IS HILARIOUS!It was so refreshing to see a cartoon movie ending in such a way.
3308;Love winning over appearance, you gotta love that!
3309;The movie tells you that happiness can be found no matter what you look like, and above all you should love yourself just the way you are.
3310;Something you WILL watch over and over again when the kids get a hold on it.
3311;The original Shrek movie is easily the best in the series and for a variety of reasons that are pretty clear to most of the viewers.
3312;Everything about the film from the fight scenes to the music and the gross habits of the ogre are all endearing.
3313;Mike Myers shines bright in this and comes off as a true original.
3314;shrek has a solid formula within the writing that doesn't take itself too serious.
3315;They also knew that they were targeting their audience somewhere between 3 and 13, but had hoped to make it appealing enough for adults.
3316;Well, they succeeded, because the film still stands up strong to repeated viewings and when you have a toddler, trust me, you'll be watching this movie a lot.
3317;All of the extras are interesting or fun and the movie is very kid friendly.
3318;best i've seen since i was nee high to a grass.
3319;a. thon treat for adults.
3320;The animation is more realistic than cartoon.
3321;my husband and I laughed till we cried and must see Shrek again in order to catch all the humorous tidbits.
3322;After so many years, still a great movie to watch with the kids, or on a date night.
3323;Story line is absolutely wonderful
3324;"The first time I saw ""Shrek"" I enjoyed it, thought it had some neat characters and really good animation."
3325;"But quite a while later they brought out ""Shrek 2"", and more recently the third chapter, and they both looked good, and I decided that instead of going right into the newer ones, I'd go back."
3326;even if there wasn't, it was pretty good the first time and would probably be a good refresher for the next ones.
3327;"So I stand corrected, it does belong up there in the same breath with ""Lilo and Stitch"" and ""Spirited Away"" and so on."
3328;Shrek is a big, green, powerful and occasionally bumbling ogre who isn't 'trying to be cranky while hiding his tenderness underneath' .
3329;he's sumltaneously a cranky lummox and a sweet.
3330;minded, noble creature of great heart (although that latter part is kind of a light hidden under a barrel for the first half of the movie).
3331;are brilliant characters who play great off of one another.
3332;The supporting cast is loaded with colorful individuals (the Gingerbread Man is a great show.
3333;stealer), and the movie is full of humorous fantasy action and some great, often wry, wit.
3334;"humor, but when it's got as much prime comedy and as much heart as ""Shrek"" does, who wants to quibble?"
3335;Shrek has got to be one of the funniest films that i have ever seen.
3336;From the start you are taken into an obscure world full of well known characters and adult themed humour.
3337;This film appeals to people of all ages as, it has the cute characters ans colour fot the youngsters and the hidden meanings for the adults.
3338;Mike Myers is fantastic as Shrek who is a green troll who everyone thinks is a savage beast, when in fact he is just a lonely guy who longs for someone to love himm, for who he is and not what he is.
3339;A must have and a great christmas present
3340;I am 14, and a huge movie buff.
3341;I see just about every movie that comes out every week of the year, and so far this is #1 on my list, and I'm willign to bet that it will make it into my top 5 at the end of the year.
3342;The character development is amazing for an animated film, and takes on such detail and feeling that you feel almost like shrek and his donkey are you and your best friend.
3343;Also, the humor is simply put, in great taste.
3344;Shrek is filled with non.
3345;stop, light hearted, good taste humor.
3346;I reccommend this movies to anyone looking for a good laugh, great time, and just some time with the family.
3347;It is hilarious and one of the best animated films ever made!
3348;Great story about judging other people.
3349;mike Myers commendably brings to life the green ogre.
3350;"When ""Shrek"" does try to be more modern by throwing in an occasional clever pop."
3351;There is little originality present here .
3352;They love this movie anyway so it was a huge hit.
3353;"It played fine and has a very extensive ""extras"" section on the actors who provided the voices."
3354;I just saw Shrek for the first time.
3355;I had heard tons of positive comments on the movie, but I'm that impressed.
3356;The best part of this film is Princess Fiona, which is not only one of the best animated characters in years, but also flawlessly captures Cameron Diaz' incredible repertoire of cute facial expressions.
3357;Worth the price of admission on her own.
3358;This is a movie we can watch with the kids and still find something new everytime we watch it.
3359;Shrek is such a cool movie.
3360;They are a lot of fun to watch.
3361;Shrek has a very cute story to it.
3362;I'll explain: For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI.
3363;up mother birds with high.
3364;I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting.
3365;"Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc. but why give the kids a head."
3366;I enormously enjoyed watching this movie.
3367;Its humor is well suited both for adults and children (mostly because children don't get the adult humor and reversed).
3368;Edie Murphy is the ultimate donkey .
3369;I think that this is his best role so far it fits him very well.
3370;Truly a delightful way to past some time.
3371;This was a fun movie!
3372;Great for family movie night!
3373;A good addition to family movie treasury section and good entertainment for sleepovers or playdates.
3374;This movie and Final Fantasy I think were the two best movies this summer.
3375;Both of them have amazing CGI animation, but the twisted humour in this one was absolutely enjoyable.
3376;there is a little bit of mild language in the film, and a lot of the humour I don't think is recommended for any children under the age of ten, however, they still may enjoy the movie.
3377;one of the things that makes this movie great has to be Eddie Murphy.
3378;I have to admit I did go to see the film twice and was sceptical if I would enjoy it the second time ,but I can't believe how many jokes I missed the first time, an excellent family film whith a great story and original characters
3379;Shrek is one of my favorite movies.
3380;Good comedy, and clean enough for the whole family to enjoy.
3381;The film is a good one, funny while sending a subtle message about not judging people by appearance, and self.
3382;Shrek got rave reviews over here, and everyone said it was brilliant.
3383;I quite enjoy kids' movies (no blood, guts or horror ^_^) and I enjoyed other CG movies such as the Toy Story films, and Antz.
3384;I also loved the idea of a movie satirising Disney fairy tales!
3385;So I was very keen to see Shrek and had high hopes for it.
3386;out humour and a slightly manic/nasty edge to it .
3387;Note the way Shrek picks her up and carries her away, humiliating her because she won't do what he wants.
3388;Farquaard is just as wicked as any Disney villain.
3389;there are some humorous parts to this movie, and some excitement, and some poignancy.
3390;once I got over being proud of myself for figuring out .
3391;I really thought about the movie.
3392;These are the finer points in the flick: 1.
3393;Whoever thought of the gingerbread man being tortured is a pure genius.
3394;I laughed so hard .
3395;An ogre's ideas of being clean are definetly unique.
3396;"comedy relief"" worked really well."
3397;"Shrek and Donkey constantly ""tease"" him about his size."
3398;the characters were funny and even though the movie was full of sarcasm and humor.
3399;"it still had its ""romantic twist""."
3400;I can honestly say that you SHOULD go see this movie.
3401;I never even heard first of this movie when it came out, and a friend suggested it and I loved it.
3402;It has a great cast of actors.
3403;Mike Myers plays Shrek and he does a wonderful job.
3404;Shrek saves the princess but something unexpected happens.
3405;This is a film definately worth seeing!!
3406;As an adult, I found this funny, but I doubt most kids would even get it.
3407;I only bought it becasue my kids loved it.
3408;It helps when we are I'm the truck or even when they are restless with having to sit still.
3409;This is one of my favs!
3410;So funny for all ages.
3411;year old, knowing it was good and funny already.
3412;I thought we could talk him through the scary dragon parts but he actually got scared of Shrek!
3413;Even in your teens this is a cute movie if you find it on TV or can watch it, I say you do!
3414;"Shrek has recieved much praise, primarily on three counts
3415;the computer animation in Shrek is impressive (though not as impressive as the recently released Monsters, Inc.).
3416;most 'tweens through adults will find the jokes very funny BUT pay attention to that PG rating.
3417;This is one of those rare gems of a movie that holds you from the first minute, presents immediately likable characters, and tells a very simple story and has fun doing it.
3418;What's most impressive to me is the care and compassion with which the filmmakers treat the characters while still making sure that this film is a blast.
3419;known plots and created exceptional characters with wonderful lines, and I find the same thing here.
3420;just enjoy this one, because that's what it was made for.
3421;I am 20 years old and I absolutely loved this movie.
3422;It is a hillarious comedy that makes even adults laugh.
3423;The computer generated animation is great and all of the characters are extremely funny.
3424;The movie adds a little mystery and a lot of comedy to the fairy tale love story.
3425;Princess Fiona is played by the charming Cameron Diaz, who does a super job portaying this character.
3426;This movie is a must see for the whole family.
3427;It will leave you and your children laughing at the edge of your seats.
3428;Shrek delighted and entertained our entire family.
3429;This is a wonderful, edgy love story about socially isolated people who find friendship and acceptance for who they truly are inside.
3430;The animation was terrific, the gags were hilarious, the scatalogical humor never went overboard, the spoofs of Disney and other popular films were outrageously funny.
3431;Recent animated movies like Shrek are wildly compelling to watch.
3432;Couple the amazing visuals with a very funny story and vocal cast, and you have the recipe for a great move.
3433;This is a great movie for grownups.
3434;The humor is timely and mostly clean.
3435;It's a great laugh and relaxing escape for the whole family.
3436;Shrek has made a name for itself in American pop culture as well as obtaining a place in cinematic history as being the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Movie.
3437;the plot was written mainly for children, but adults will love it as there are many adult.
3438;the movie went on to be one of the most successful animated movies of all.
3439;Newsweek calls """"Shrek """"smart and hilarious""""."""
3440;My favorite movie of all time.
3441;It takes me to my happy place.
3442;Whenever I need to be uplifted, I watch this movie.
3443;I bought this for my grandson and ending up loving it myself, so much so that I bought all of the Shrek movies.
3444;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
3445;It has everything: romance, adventure, comedy, drama, suspense, music.
3446;That pretty much sums up Shrek.
3447;"The audience was very diverse
3448;In particular, when the Matrix parody began every single person in the theater burst into huge fits of laughter, myself included.
3449;everyone in the cast did a great job voicing, but Eddie Murphy, with his talking.
3450;nonstop Donkey, and John Lithgow, with his deliciously evil Lord Farquaad, really stole the show.
3451;Shrek is a completely entertaining film.
3452;There are so many references to the Disney.
3453;All the vocal talents are spot on.
3454;I particularly liked the interviews with the cast members.
3455;And, along with Memento , the best thing I've seen so far in '01.
3456;I remember seeing a trailer for Shrek some months ago, and I knew at that moment that I would have to see this movie.
3457;This is the first in a great series of fairy tale parodies!
3458;iS A GOOD KIDS FILM.
3459;Shrek is on of a long line of growing computer animated movies that began with Toy Story.
3460;Each movie becomes more realistic.
3461;The characters almost look like real people and animals.
3462;He chooses the lovely Princess Fiona.
3463;But Princess Fiona is held prisoner by a fierce dragon.
3464;One funny scene is when Lord Farquaad tortures the gingerbread man (who sounds a lot like Mr. Bill of Saturday Night Live).
3465;eddie Murphy was his hysterical best as the voice of the donkey.
3466;Each movie is more realistic.
3467;Final Fantasy and Disney's Dinosuars are the nmost realistic to date.
3468;There are many software programs on the market.
3469;Some are very expensive but, a few are reasonable and are quite good .
3470;He is fine with his normal life of living in a swamp and being alone until Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphy)"
3471;This movie has been so long in the making that Chris Farley was originally intended to voice the role of Shrek but with his passing Mike Myers took the role and did a great job.
3472;From kung fu to singing at a pitch so high that a bird blows up, her character gets many laughs.
3473;"As for Eddie Murphy
3474;See this movie before the book is closed.
3475;it's one of the best Films I've ever seen.
3476;d, which is a great 4.
3477;d theme park attraction at Universal Studios.
3478;d. so see it at the theme park, in all it's glory.
3479;This is what makes the film popular with children as well as adults.
3480;The moral of this story is to see past his grossness and see the good person inside.
3481;The Shrek generation is going to be so messed up.
3482;If I ever see a book or movie or documentary, that uses the phrase, """"The Shrek Generation"""" I am going to sue you and demand royalties of some kind."""
3483;This state of the art movie is both enjoyable for kids as well as adults.
3484;Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy have great comedic chemistry.
3485;CGI is becoming a very popular form of animation and it is really nice to see DreamWorks step up and compete with Pixar.
3486;This is a great comedy for young and old,it is Smart and Hilarious.You have your action for the guys and your love story for gals,along with GIRL power fromFiona.
3487;a thrilling and entertaining movie for all,the sequels didn't get my votes.
3488;"then Shrek ""forever after"" came out and restored my hope of a great finish to thesaga."
3489;My three year old daughter loves it, as do my wife and I.
3490;There are dramatic moments, humor galore, and a great story.
3491;After the credits comes one of the greatest surprises.
3492;Dreamworks scores a great hit with Shrek!
3493;But the second disk rocks!
3494;The mix on the DTS track has greater dynamic range, more like the original theater sound track.
3495;"Turn up the volume and you realy hear what ""home theater"" can do."
3496;lots of good extras too.
3497;Tech of Shrek was interesting and even funny.
3498;just thinking about it makes me want to go watch it again!
3499;My whole family loves this movie.
3500;"Doesn't matter it its your first time or your hundreth
3501;This is the 2nd time seeing the movie for me, and I absolutely LOVE it!
3502;I thought it was extremely funny and enjoyable.
3503;I definitely recommend seeing it, though.
3504;Shrek is perhaps the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.
3505;Is it the funny Matrix .
3506;Actually, for me it's that wisecracking Donkey, who, done by Eddie Murphy, is hilarious for his comments.
3507;Perhaps it's the rendition of I'm a Believer.
3508;If you watch Shrek, prepare to laugh.
3509;But hey, that's more than you can say for TV lately.
3510;Some people absolutely adore this movie.
3511;I really wanted to like Shrek .
3512;The tale is a promising one.
3513;Beast (with a heart) meets Beauty (who has a secret).
3514;bub this movie was attracting and figured I'd check it out"
3515;it was a great movie!
3516;Even if you're not a fan of animation movies (as I really am not), the animation is spectacular and the story.
3517;thought out adventure, with life.
3518;d is alright on the television but much better on the computer.
3519;the movie is great too, the animation is excellant.
3520;This movie is absolutely a must have for any collector of movies.
3521;I'm just a big 'ole kid at heart, but even adults will love this movie.
3522;Then there are the innuendos that the adults will find hilarious.
3523;It's also a spoof on a lot of the fairy tales that we know and love.
3524;Combining the comic genius of Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy into one movie was a wonderful move and made for a great movie.
3525;I would recommend this to children and adults of all ages.
3526;I have to say I haven't laughed that loud and much for years!You could say children will be more addicted to it, I concede that, but also adults will find entertainment and enjoy a bit more than an hour of fine humor.
3527;the plot is really well thought and it makes fun of all those fairy tales you used to read when little (like Cinderella, Snowwhite and such).
3528;wish you could enjoy it as much as I did!
3529;This movie is cute and I love the digs on Disney and Fairy Tales.
3530;I recommend it for 5 year olds up to adults.
3531;From the viewpoint of adults, it was a great comedic fairy tale.
3532;This is one of the more entertaining films I have seen in a long time.
3533;the reason why it is so good is the plot density.
3534;anyway this is a classic film.
3535;All of the actors who do the voice overs, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Carmen Diaz are brilliant.
3536;Beauty and the Beast is probably as far as Hollywood had ever departed from the beauty and prince rule, but wait .
3537;Beast is *really* a prince!
3538;able, but at least we see an individual, full of life, with his own thoughts and emotions.
3539;Part of the movie's attraction is how it deviates from the cliches of the traditional romantic fairy.
3540;"In the romance that ensues between the two, we see the wonder of love in the characters: true emotions
3541;We see that love in fairy.
3542;much like the real world, actually.
3543;tale movie that is as inspired, three.
3544;warming, entertaining, and morally conscious all at the same time?
3545;Shrek, has it's good points but it is completely not suitable for children, there are noticable sexual jokes throughout the entire movie.
3546;I saw it with my 8 year old neice, and believe me, she knew what they where talking about, and the reason that she does is because she has seen it on TV.
3547;This movie was one of the 1st from Disney Pixar, in my opinion, one of the best carry on Disney Pixar
3548;It is literally packed with comedy.
3549;None of it is bad, most is a amusing and a good portion is down right hilarious.
3550;my favorite: Lord Farquaad (the voice of John Lithgow is perfect for th part) is interrogating The Gingerbread Man (how'd he catch him anyway?)
3551;the movie was definitely made for both adults and children.
3552;Almost all of the jokes have an adult slant on them, but there are so many quirky, cute characters that the kids are sure to be entertained.
3553;Eddie Murphy as The donkey was, like John Lithgow, perfectly cast.
3554;this is the best movie.
3555;the voice castings (especially for Shrek and Donkey), the dialogue, and the soundtrack are amazing.
3556;advised due to the humor (come on, you've got both Eddie Murphy AND Mike Myers together) it is the ultimate fairytale adventure for the whole family!
3557;bought movie for my son and he watches it almost everyday!
3558;This was a funny but cleaver movie and excellent to watch from the visual side that I have seen for a while.
3559;like Pokemon and then dragon ball Z, Shek has know toys here yet I hope to get one when they come and a copy of the movieso I can see it again Iknow I will enjoy It as much the jokes are just wonderful a must see.
3560;This movie fits the well worn cliche: Fun for all ages better than any other film before it.
3561;It is rare that you will find a movie that appeals to all these demogrpahic groups but in Shrek you have the answer to the family movie dilemma.
3562;Mike Meyers and John Lithgow turn in similarly professional efforts as Shrek and Lord Farquaad.
3563;the humour is razor sharp and there is enough witty sarcasm to appeal to the adults, as well as Shrek's disgusting habits to appeal to the little ones.
3564;Just the way I like 'em!
3565;Interviews with the cast AND Characters!
3566;And a Karaoke session that has to be seen!
3567;but I think the best bonus feature of all is the Shrek Voice Over that actually lets you add your voice to scenes.
3568;We loved this Shrek movie.
3569;it is very cute and funny.
3570;Dreamworks has finally found their way to the world of animation.
3571;Their past animations are far from good, but Shrek would definitely be a breakthrough for them.
3572;, and the backgrounds are spectacular.
3573;Although at certain places, you could still feel the characters moving like line.
3574;You can see all the classical fairy tale characters in the movie, and even more.
3575;Shrek, who was an Ogre was disgustingly funny.
3576;You could not accept some of his behaviours or abilities , but they would really give you a good laugh in the theatre.
3577;Eddy Murphy's voice dubbing really made the donkey alive.
3578;You could feel Cameron Diaz's superb performance in animated format.
3579;What a great, refreshing movie this is!
3580;I was so pleasantly surprised with it.
3581;It really is a hoot and great entertainment.
3582;I found it much more fun than anything by Disney or Pixar.
3583;Hidden humor for the adults yet cute and sweet for kids.
3584;If you haven't seen it I recommend you do, but if you've seen it you know it is worth the price
3585;SHREK is one of the best movies of 2001.
3586;Granted it's a CGI film.
3587;Shrek is an ogre who lives alone in his swamp and is quite happy there until one day he saves a talking donkey from a group of guards.
3588;Shrek and Donkey set forth to meet Farquaad and end up going on a quest to save the beautiful Princess Fiona (who happens to have a beauty secret).
3589;day fairy tale told using computer animation.
3590;That specific satirical cartooning is one of SHREK's biggest treats.
3591;The first Shrek is very funny and you should get it.
3592;notch, but it tells a compelling story.
3593;The story is one that eberyone can enjoy.
3594;Kids will love the adventure, while adults can enjoy the hidden jokes on topics ranging from Disney to the WWF.
3595;Myers is great as the voice of the ogre Shrek, who simply wants to be left alone.
3596;Diaz does a great job at portraying both the sarcastic side and tender and insecure side of Princess Fiona.
3597;The original Shrek was a CG classic or masterpiece.
3598;It's truly a work of art in the computer graphics field.
3599;The detail in the CGI was AMAZING for its time and it still manages to impress me today.
3600;the movie just has the word clever written all over it.
3601;It can definately satisfy a group of young children while also managing to get some adults to laugh hysterically.
3602;Some films have tried to make a great voice.
3603;So pretty much what makes this movie work is the talent, humor, and clever animation.
3604;It was a huge success because it was such an original and fun film.
3605;It was quite humorous and had many catchy songs in it that our daughter still recognizes on the radio.
3606;We loved the adult humor in it as well.
3607;It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy.
3608;it has so much content.
3609;I Like this movie I finally saw it I laughed threw it alot of funny moments to it and I say its one of the best animated movies ever made.
3610;I know it would be a great gift for my brother .
3611;I know he'll love it for Christmas.
3612;Some people found Shrek to be descriminatory and prejudiced.
3613;It literally brings me to the point of nausea to hear this called the best movie of all time.
3614;This movie is just well tought.
3615;You can be an adult, you can be a kid, you'll enjoy it
3616;I first saw this movie at the theaters, I(23 then) went with my dad(59 then) to see it, our first intention wasn't see Shrek, we were looking for something else, but find nothing better to watch than Shrek, well, we both loved it, that gives you and idea of how good this movie is, it has no age.
3617;Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are the best!
3618;Very good production values, very poor human values.
3619;Princess Fiona kind of gives me on my nerves and what is all this talking about LOVE in the end?????????
3620;Monsters, Inc was much better, more funnier, more enjoyable, much better.
3621;That is the movie of the feature and will always be.
3622;Watching a character that had trouble getting along with others was a great watch.
3623;The extended ending gave me belly laughs and the extras are worth 5 stars by themselves.
3624;I'd agree that Shrek lacks the sweetness of Toy Story but it more than makes up for that with its visual and verbal barbs aimed everywhere (The Matrix, Disney, Snow White, classic rock songs, fairytales, etc.).
3625;Shrek manages to spoof a number of genres all within less than two hours.
3626;The second disc has a director commentary that's both fun and enlightening.
3627;Including both the widescreen and full screen versions is perfect for this family"
3628;We're both kept happy in the process.
3629;The sound mix is great whether you're watching it on your television or in DTS.
3630;Kudos to Dreamworks for putting together another winner and for pulling out all the stops for this entertaining film.
3631;, this movie offers it all.
3632;Action and romance to keep the boys and the girls happy, and a very healthy dose of humour for the adults.
3633;That is a rare occurrence, be it with adult or children's movies.
3634;While the whole cast is excellent in the voice overs, Eddie Murphy's donkey is the key to the warmth of the story which is part road.
3635;tale.You've got to get it.
3636;It'll keep you laughing over and over.
3637;Shrek is a highly entertaining film, that will bring out the kid in everyone.
3638;It may just be another fairy tale, but with the clever dialog, fun characters, jokes, and great animation, Shrek is about as good as they come.
3639;And he seems to be happy that way.
3640;Now once Shrek get to the castle with the donkey ( and some well placed puns) we run into a love hungry dragon and the princess who has some set notions as to what needs to happen when she is rescued.
3641;i will add that this movie is full of action, fun, romance, humor, and drama.
3642;it is a must see for kids and adults alike.
3643;It is a totally awesome movie.
3644;The plot is great, the amimation is top notch, and it's hilarious.
3645;Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), and Camron Diaz (Fiona) are a perfect fit for this film.
3646;Their voices are superb for the characters that they portray.
3647;SHREK is an awesome film that will keep you entertained.
3648;thank you for your support
3649;Was funny and the livity of it all was uncanny and cool!!
3650;In a good and laughable way.
3651;This is just a fun movie.
3652;One of the few movies out today that the entire family will enjoy.
3653;Almost everyone loves this movie.
3654;It is a great story for the kids but there are a lot of quirky situations that will keep the adults interested and amused.
3655;At best, it's harmless for your kids.
3656;It arrived in brand new condition and was perfect and pleasing in every way.
3657;I ended up giving this to a homeless mother who had visitation with her child and it was his favorite movie.
3658;This is one funny movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3659;Eddie Murphy is great as the voice of Donkey.
3660;This movie also bashes the dominating world of Disney thanks to Jeffery Katzenberg.
3661;This movie will also remind you of The Naked Gun spoofs.
3662;Trust me, you will have a great time seeing this film like I did.
3663;As an adult, I actually really liked it.
3664;So if you're ok with a mild amount of cursing, the movie is fine.
3665;It ranks right up there with Cars and Toy Story.
3666;The Shrek movies are funny.
3667;He just smiles at the characters.
3668;This is one of the most enjoyable and halarious movies I have seen in a long time.
3669;We loved the movie so much we went to go and see it again the next day and enjoyed it just as much!
3670;Shrek is a very likable and reluctant hero who is well.
3671;His mannerisms and facial expressions are so detailed.
3672;Mike Myer's famous Scottish accent fits Shrek's personality so well.
3673;Donkey is so funny in the movie!
3674;john Lithgow was excellent as the prince with a Napoleon complex that does not escape the notice of Shrek and Donkey.
3675;Lithgow's voice fits the prince so well.
3676;His funny name will go over most kids head as will many of the jokes in the film( But there is still plenty left for them to get).
3677;shrek is a fast moving adventure that leaves you begging for more but doesn't drag on.
3678;There is lots of action and some fairy.
3679;tale romance that the kiddies will appreciate.
3680;goers will just ignore it and enjoy the show, especially if they realize they have never heard their kids laugh so hard.
3681;this movie is a funny and amusing movie but not more.
3682;"The voice acting was ok
3683;The animation is pretty good, though not as impressive as found in the movie Final Fantasy: Spirits Within .
3684;It is, quite simply, an all around good film that excels in every single category.
3685;Visually, it is, of course, stunning.
3686;life, but it lacked natural realism of living expression, something that Shrek exceeds at even in the most blatantly fictional species.
3687;Shrek himself is more convincing and more likely to jump from the screen than anything offered to us from Final Fantasy.
3688;if humor is the object, than Shrek no doubt appeals to all demographics, catering to the young, the old, and everything in between for a hilarious romp that never stops.
3689;The story is simple and inspiring enough to be successful, though admittedly predictable.
3690;and behind it all is some phenomenal acting"
3691;Great acting and great animation couple with an amusing story that collects into one of the greatest animated films of all time, certainly one of the best, and certainly one of the most unusual in film history.
3692;Shrek is well worth your attention!
3693;I was suprised that the film had a lot of adult humor and was very funny.
3694;You think it'll be like a normal fairy tale but in fact it makes fun of all the fairy tales that are very popular.
3695;this was a great movie which I have seen twice.
3696;oriented film that actually kept me awake.
3697;The storyline was tight, the graphics were amazing, and there were numerous hilarious moments in the film.
3698;I do recommend getting the short movie because it is a great Shrek movie but I don't recommend watching it in 3.
3699;I rated it two stars because 3.
3700;The movie is excellent though and I rate that 4 stars.
3701;He imatates shrek and the donkey.
3702;It's a movie that even adults can enjoy over and over.
3703;Thank you so much for your work on this wonderful movie.
3704;The donkey (Eddie Murphy) is the key of the whole movie and it's so funny.
3705;Also some execllent moment in the movie add more fun to it, such as the martial arts action of the princess, Lord Farquad's acting.
3706;pretty much poking fun at your classic fairy tale creatures.
3707;shrek, an ogre with a big heart, and a faithful side.
3708;it is a great film for both kid's and adults, with enough humor to keep both laughing through the film.
3709;i *highly* recommend this if you are looking for a good laugh.
