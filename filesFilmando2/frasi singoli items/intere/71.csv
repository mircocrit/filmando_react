1;Best horror movie ever even thought or made.
2;Still does gve the chills that it did a long time ago.
3;This is a definate for all hardcore movie buffs.
4;Linda Blair plays the role of the little girl and has a great performance.
5;the key element of this hallmark is that 'The Exorcist' is so convincingly real.
6;All of the inquiry gives the whole horror a plausible presentation.
7;As expertly as the sound and special effects are rendered, there is little for the audience to guess at what times terrible things will happen.
8;The presence of the demon inside of Regan makes its menace present to the audience as well.
9;She has three helpers, including two German immigrants, and her director, Burke Dennings, provides an important part of the plot's direction.
10;Merrin [Max Von Sydow]) whose determination and struggles give more meaning to the main plot and how it remarkably develops.
11;'The Exorcist' was directed skillfully by William Friedkin who has a host of classics under his directing belt, including 'The French Connection'.
12;Based on William Peter Blatty's modern bestseller and a screenplay adapted by him, 'The Exorcist' is still a masterpiece of modern horror meant to make one look for a reality beyond the senses.
13;ray Book packaging is one of the best collector's editions I have ever owned.
14;The package itself is simple, it is a hardcover book.
15;ray transfer is gorgeous, done personally by Friedkin and cinematographer Owen Roizman.
16;for any fan of this film or film and general this is worth the $45 that it cost.
17;com page so I will relax on that.
18;i think this one is best.
19;its pretty intense,many people get scared off.
20;every so often they redo this movie.
21;This will always be the greatest horror Movie of all time.
22;I'm an Exorcist fan since the 1973 release.
23;Now the new version is as close to perfection as a movie can be.
24;The most remarkable achivement is the remastered sound.
25;The subliminal images added to the film makes the house itself part of the possesion.
26;(Like the image in the kitchen when Chris arrives and the mother image in the window at the end) If you take one look at this film from Chris Mcneal point of view, you'll see the perfection of Ellen Burstyn performance and the terrifying experience she's going throug.
27;As a cinematographic work, is perfect.
28;The only But is the staircase scene, is great, yes, but is better in the deleted scenes in the 25th anniversary eddition.
29;The rest of the added scenes help to the continuity of the film.
30;william Peter Blatty's The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, starring Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, and the wonderful Max von Sydow.
31;All the principal actors, as well as the supporting cast, gave brilliant performances.
32;It won the Oscar for Best Sound and Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (it was nominated for 8 other Oscars, including Best Picture).
33;It's also a story of faith and redemption.
34;There are some horrifying images throughout the film.
35;So many things help to add up to create this movie in all it's horrifying glory.
36;This is truly one of the best films ever made.
37;Friedkin also has a commentary track, and a very good one.
38;He discusses the film, and he does a great job of it.
39;It's a great commentary (though I wish he had added a technical commentary track), one that is valuable for the fan of The Exorcist and even more so for the film student.
40;The Exorcist starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair is considered the best horror film of all.
41;The acting is excellent but overall this movie doesn't live up to the hype, sorry.
42;Simply put, the scariest movie ever filmed.
43;"personally, I prefer the ""on location"" effects, live in front of the camera."
44;"This film blends the credible with the incredible, and , this many years later, it is STILL the most terrifying film ever made, along with the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
45;This film has awsome special effects in it.
46;I was suprised on how good the movie was since it was made in the 70's.
47;While this film is infamous for certain scenes: projectile vomiting and rotating heads amongst them, it is actually an intelligent and disturbing film.
48;The cut between the initial dusty scenes in Iraq to Washington DC is an instructive culture shock.
49;Ellen Burstyn is a brilliant actress and shows a full range of emotions here.
50;Jason Miller as Father Karras is also convincing as the troubled priest.
51;Max Von Sydow somehow has managed to look 70 years old for the past 3 decades .
52;"The Exorcist, along with such movies as ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Shining"", and ""The Ring"" stand out to me as some of the greatest horror movies of all time."
53;"Not only were they great movies in and of themselves, but they ""broke the rules"" and treaded new ground."
54;When you truly watch the movie for the first time, you will truely be scared.
55;Like the other movies listed above, it used intelligent imagery, dialogue, and symbols to make its points.
56;The Exorcist truly deserves all 5 stars.
57;Hope my wife will someday have the guts to watch it with me.
58;This story gives people of all ages to see what's real and gives them a chance to test their faith.
59;Wether you want it to or not, this movie will scare you, shock you, or just creep you out, a lot.
60;The acting isn't bad, and there are some parts that are really actually quite funny.
61;The soundtrack fits really well with the film, and the visual effects, though cheesy, are pretty entertaining to watch.
62;The Exorcist Was a great movie.
63;Other scenes of the movie are'nt that amusing.
64;The oringinal plot was a great movie.
65;The deleted scenes in the book like The Spider Walk.
66;It is a great classic horror movie.
67;The special effects are amazing.
68;It looks and sounds incredible.
69;Thank you to the team at Warners who handled this for doing it the right way and treating it with respect.
70;Really good if your a fan of the original movie.
71;still a really good scare, even after all these years.
72;I remember her vomiting into the man's face.
73;I remember her floating into the air and her skin splitting open.
74;THE EXORCIST is my earliest memory.
75;Regan likes horses, she likes art and has a mini.
76;Regan is cute as can be.
77;Director Friedkin paints a picture of a very normal family, a very normal girl, innocent and cheerful and a joy to be around.
78;tHE EXORCIST is, hands down, my favorite movie of all time.
79;Part of its success is due to Blair's portrayal of such a simple little girl.
80;Part of its success is due to Blair's portrayal of the demon.
81;Even at 12 years old, Linda Blair made this movie what it is (earning herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the process).
82;Part of the story's success is due to author Blatty's way of avoiding a drawn out explanation.
83;This is the story's brilliance.
84;She's just, one day, possessed.
85;Nothing so far has even come close to matching the original.
86;THE EXORCIST is and always will be THE horror movie to beat.
87;Ok I loved this movie.
88;but in this case, since I am a video artist and I love film.
89;With director comentaries, I feel they are a great source of Information.
90;well I loved hearing about Friedkin talking about filming in Iraq.
91;But with Freidkin You got a since of his vision and not Blatty's.
92;this is a man who created something so profound.
93;he has yet to make something as Good as the Excorcist.
94;A superbly done classic and as scary as they come.
95;The exorcist is one of my favorite movies.
96;Still awesome even years later in the days of CGI.
97;No computer beats good old fashioned strong acting, scripting and directing.
98;Any fan of the genre loves this film.
99;Excellent movie, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
100;For a 1970's film, it was very well made, and the special effect were excellent, as well as a creepy score that set the tone of the film perfectly
101;William Peter Blatty wrote an excellent novel, and William Friedkin chose the right film to direct.
102;Horror fans should give this a chance, and hope to make this movies one of their favorites in their list of favorite horror movies.
103;Thought it was great back in the day.
104;This is one of the best horror movies of all time.
105;Nipsey loved it back in the early 70's when he took Jo ann Worley to see this flick.
106;And Nipsey still loves it to this day.
107;The Exorcist is a pretty good movie.
108;The Exorcist is very good movie.
109;What I got was a beautiful, masterful film of pure genius.
110;Great acting, cinematography, special effects, and storyline make this a disturbing, desciptive movie on the demonic takeover on a child's life.
111;The Best Scary Movie Ever!!!!
112;When he sees there is nothing else to do, he tells the demon to come into him.
113;It still remains the scariest movie I have EVER seen.
114;I'd give it more than five stars if I could.
115;Viewing The Version You've Never Seen in the theater in September 2000 marked the first time I'd seen The Exorcist on the big screen, and I loved the experience .
116;Still, I saw the movie two more times while it played in theaters and was gripped by the details every time.
117;More importantly, Friedkin helped fashion a soundtrack to the 1973 original that focused on subtlety and the rawness of the moment.
118;I'd rather just be scared on my own, thank you very much.
119;Though I really like this new movie and recommend it especially to the die.
120;hard fans like myself, I as an Exorcist buff found the added sound elements, as well as the video tricks .
121;I almost laughed myself seeing Chris MacNeil walk around in shawls and plaid skirts.
122;I recommend this movie, but keep in mind that the masterpiece was finished a generation ago.
123;It was a smooth feeling.
124;meanwhile, I was engrossed in one of the most fascinating books I have ever read.
125;The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty remains one of my favorite books of all time.
126;I especially liked Jason Miller's portrayal of the priest/physician/psychiatrist who ultimately tips the scale towards Good and God, and away from Evil and the devil, by giving his own life.
127;a complex movie which almost certainly has to be watched a few times to get a feel for all that is put into this cinematic masterpiece.
128;I enjoy watching it STILL, to this very day.
129;I have seen a thousand horror movies and The Exorcist is the greatest of all.
130;Even though it was made in '73, the graphics are excellent and the build up is just fantastic.
131;A true horror and excellent for curing constipation.
132;A priest who believes the daughter is actually possessed.
133;the special effects are quite impressing for the time and with the 11 minutes of extra scenes added since the first version, this movie is quite a classic and should be seen by anyone, no matter of what religious beliefs.
134;well, movie nicely shot and acted, though a bit slow, good transfer .
135;For real horror, dig into the history of the Roman church among others.
136;1973's The Exorcist is one of the best movies I've ever viewed.
137;I read the book, and the movie does a beautiful justice to it.
138;Jason Miller puts in an excellent performance as the troubled Jesuit priest.
139;I think The Exorcist III was based upon it, and it a very good follow.
140;Excellent acting all around, smashing special effects and stunts, and a terrifying storyline make this a must for any film buff.
141;fi: the greatest of its type.
142;have.you) was the glimpse into the invisible but very real world of Lucifer and his never.
143;equalled score by Mike Oldfield Tubular Bells plus the tremendously powerful script and direction.
144;A perfect storm of cinematic excellence.
145;I was more weirded out than scared but this was a fantastic movie.
146;If your Catholic as well like I am, your faith will increase because this shit is real.
147;The devil and demons are real in this world.
148;If your bored and want a good horror or thriller film watch this and the effects are so good that you won't believe it was made in 1972
149;The 70's was a good time for horror movies (not just because of 70's fashion either), with The Omen, Halloween, Carrie, and other great ones.
150;The Exorcist is easily the best horror film every made (it was also nominated for SEVEN ACADEMY AWARDS).
151;It is both immensely mature and intelligent in the way it deals with its subject and never plays its disturbing content for laughs.
152;That aside, the film is both the most frightening horror film ever made, as well the most intelligent and best made.
153;This is probably the best horror film to date, still an excellent movies even though the effects are dated.
154;I had a good week watching old favorites, among them The Exorcist .
155;Funny how we think we know the story well, but when we go back there's tremendous detail that was lost in the intervening years.
156;creepy!Somehow the movie feels dignified and restrained after 40 years of Hollywood horror excess, and that adds to its charm and ability to touch and move the audience.
157;I actually laughed when the possessed Regan grabbed the priest's crotch during the exorcism.
158;I know, it's only entertainment and opinions/tastes can be highly subjective.
159;Still an excellent movie that is based on a real possession.
160;It's still the scariest movie ever created by a landslide.
161;With the help of talented actress Mercedes McCambridge who provided the voice for the possessed Reagan, Linda Blair's performance continues to haunt audiences to this day.
162;The Special FX, especially the makeup, are iconic.
163;Many modern horror movies like The Ring and The Conjuring have copied the possessed look verbatim.
164;second flashes of Pazuzu the 1st time they see it.
165;both actors cast as the movie's 2 priests play their roles perfectly.
166;the Exorcist is a simple movie.
167;The underlying story is the quintessential Good VS Evil.
168;The best modern day horror film !
169;It portrays evil and demonic possession vividly.
170;The exorcism scenes are powerful reminders that God, Christ or whatever deity you believe in can save you through faith.
171;I bought this item few years ago!
172;played perfect and shipped very fast!
173;"Viewed: 1/04, 9/04, 7/05, 2/06, 1/13Rate: 107/05: ""What an excellent day for an exorcism."""
174;Well, The Exorcist is one of the finest horror films ever made.
175;It is chilling and eerie every time I see The Exorcist.
176;There are awesome scenes, especially the famous taxi stop in front of the house.
177;She is so scary that it is effective.
178;Jason Miller is absolutely phenomenal in his role: very real and attuned to the character of Father Damien.
179;made and an important landmark film in the world of horror films.
180;I am also impressed with the way the director set up the complex telling of a story and has the characters hide the centerpiece until it comes out very alive after about an hour.2/06: The Exorcist is truly a horrifying picture consisting of incredible special effects.
181;before is a lot better than the original, and it contains a much better yet more kind ending than the previous.
182;Two incredible performances are of Max von Syndow and Jason Miller in his stunning debut.
183;Then, of course, there is Linda Blair in a mesmerizing role.
184;It's a true horror film that remains to be perpetually memorable for decades.
185;Accolades are given for the direction by William Friedkin, the special effects team, and the actors.
186;It's still a great horror masterpiece.
187;Still, walking on it is an interesting experience.
188;All in all, William Friedkin brought the best out of everybody in The Exorcist.
189;based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, The Exorcist is a movie that will stay with your for a lifetime.
190;i love this movie without any questions im 13 and i still love watching this i paid for th 5.7 day shipping, and got it the next day THATS GREAT SERVICE!
191;this movie will chill your bone and leave you breathless and shocking!
192;watch this movie and you will know what I mean!
193;The Exorcist is one of the greatest movies ever.
194;it too will take you on a ride you will never forget!
195;having said that, it is entertaining.
196;As I'm sure you know a very young, very pretty Linda Blair plays the possessed child and Ellen Burstyn plays her actress mother.
197;They are both believable and lovable in their rolls before the demon takes over.
198;When the young priest who is a psychiatrist for the Jesuits agrees to go see the child, she gives what the audience understands to be convincing proof of her possession, including the famous head turning all the way around.
199;the exorcism is successful, the child is fine and remembers nothing of the possession, and she and her mother are returning to California, available for the sequel.
200;There are some movies made that go on to achieve epic like status and become permanently ingrained in people's psyches.
201;This is one of those films.
202;The two live in a nice Georgetown townhouse and all seems well.
203;The brilliant Max Von Sydow is Father Merrin, an elderly man of the cloth is called upon to perform the exorcism.
204;The film has an undeniable sense of fear and dread from the very beginning.
205;Linda Blair is fantastic as the put upon Reagan, and she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar.
206;Jason Miller brings a strong, intense presence to his role, and the camera eats him up in every scene.
207;The film also boasts one of the finest scary soundtracks captured on film.
208;Tubular Bells is chilling, haunting, and unforgettable.
209;up on little Reagan is some of the most chilling and frightening images caught on film.
210;"Her ""episodes"" and final exorcism are bone chilling and some of the most frightening and scariest pieces of film."
211;There are a few scenes here that are classic and just those images will always be remembered and stand the test of time.
212;I think a certain image of Father Merrin standing under that street light is the best.
213;Part 2 is one of the worst films/sequels ever, but Part 3 was decent enough to watch.
214;There is a reason this film is always at the top of every horror/scary movie list.
215;It is that good, and yes, it is that downright scary.
216;I love The Exorcist .
217;There is always a simple first question to be asked when an older film is released on blu ray.
218;I can gladly 1000% say that this one is handled with loving care.
219;Color and the black/white ration is amazing.
220;Close ups throughout will have you awestruck.
221;It honestly is like viewing the film for the first time.
222;And they so impressively left the grainy parts intact.
223;Audio is superb and your home theater system will have a field day with the dramatic audio here.
224;I was amazed at how my perceptioon of the film changed due to this amazing version.
225;I think it is a huge gift that both the original theatrical version and the later extended director's cut are presented here in blu ray glory.
226;It is so much more than this.
227;The Catholic Church plays a huge part and obviously represents the good and it works so well.
228;The priests here are good men, some troubled but all wanting to do their best.
229;Regan is perfectly displayed as an innocent without rubbing it in the viewers face.
230;In a world with such trouble this films clearly shows that there is good and evil.
231;And there are special effects galore.
232;There is a new 3 part documentary on the film's production and legacy plus a feature length 1998 documentary on the making of the film with so much more.
233;It is one of the best movies made of any genre and deserves to be in any film collectors library.
234;And this blu ray version does immense justice to a classic.
235;The music will haunt you for the rest of your life.
236;This was the first horror film I ever saw as a kid, and a Catholic kid at that, and it remains my favorite horror film to this day.
237;Spinning heads, spider walks, pea soup vomitting and using a crucifix.
238;well,in a very explicit way adds up to some extremely freaky scenes.
239;Linda Blair probobly still surprises the heck out of herself that this was her.
240;You just have to see this movie!
241;the year is 1973, this movie is released, and we're seeing a little girl possessed by the devil and stabbing herself in the you.
242;this particular segment may be over 20 minutes long, but it's the most heart.
243;pounding and captivating 20 minutes I've ever felt in a horror movie and makes it difficult for other movies to surpass.
244;star picture perfect horror classic.
245;For 1973, it's well ahead of its time and I can only imagine how controversial this movie was back then because it's incredibly graphic even to this day.
246;Still one of my favorites and never gets old if your looking for a good nail biting movie then this is it.
247;The use of music and silence are riveting, and the effects still do their thing.
248;it's the tale of an innocent pre.
249;and they both have their hands full as the demon proves to be more than a match.
250;This one is the original in tact and more satisfying.
251;This is one the best movies I've ever seen, this is real horror.
252;or how exactly she got possessed (there had to be a cause) just read the book, you'd love it) The new version, well, with the added scenes, I thought it was great, but a lot of people are like .
253;I think that this movie would be well worth it.
254;This is such an awesome movie.
255;I was VERY pleased with this movie.
256;To watch it all over again, with a few scenes added back in, was amazing.
257;"I watched this movie after dark
258;It is best to see it late at night with no lights on.
259;Cuddle closely with you loved one, hold them tight!
260;A great little update of sorts for The Exorcist, featuring a half hour documentary [Very intriguing, especially if you liked the movie] on the making of the movie with interviews from the cast and crew.
261;Now on to the movie itself, which is great of course.
262;the female leads are excellent, particularly Linda Blair in the infamous role as Reagan, the possessed child.
263;Mercedes Mcambridge is excellent in the horrific role as the demon's voice, and Ellen Burstyn gives a very believeable and respectable performance as the obviously distressed mother.
264;The priests as well, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are also excellent.
265;the famous parts of this movie are the effects [Spinning head, demonic face, flying vomit and then some], and the excellent score all around.
266;The effects still hold up well today, although the shock value has obviously been lessened.
267;The score itself is chilling, the best since Psycho.
268;Jack Nitzche does an excellent job with it and should have been awarded for his work.
269;The novel has been excellently adapted to fit the screen by Blatty, the screenplay is believeable and excellent, and the novel is another must for any fans of the horror genre.
270;This is one of my favorite movies, though I don't watch it that often.
271;While it may not be as terrifying compared to the horror movies of today, which are so heavily supported by CGI, it seems so much more believable because of it's simplicity.
272;This film depicts a successful actress whose daughter's body has been possessed by the Devil himself.
273;Ellen Burstyn plays a powerful role as the mother, Chris MacNeil.
274;She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and did Linda Blair for Best Supporting Actress.
275;The film holds intensity up until the shocking exorcism scene, performed by Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow.
276;The film is a true masterpiece of the horror genre and the best among the AFI's 100 Greatest Movie List.
277;It is truely rare for a film to transend its plot, its genre.
278;true but in grand context totally meaningless.
279;this was 1973, which is part of the reason the Exorcist works so amazingly on so many levels.
280;There were ambulances waiting out in front of some theatres, due to the shortness of breath, heart palpitations, etc. of certain audience members.
281;Ellen Burstyn is perfect as the moviestar mom, exhausting all options to get help for her possessed daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), who grows increasingly dangerous to herself and others.
282;Blair captures both the sweet innocence and vile demonic presence inhabiting her body.
283;She is an astonishing figure once the pea.
284;Jason Miller is great as the priest who thinks he's lost his faith.
285;He performs the rites of exorcism in a normal / natural way that makes it seem like a totally real event.
286;I read the book and found the movie to be every bit as jolting.
287;One of THE best horror films ever made.
288;Just watched it again on amazon and truly enjoyed it.
289;the story is simple, making the movie natural and believable.
290;This is and always will be the best.
291;Watch the film with 0 expectations and with the lights off, by yourself, and see what I'm talking about.
292;I wanted to watch The Exorcist for content and by a wonderful accident I got the the wrong movie.
293;george C. Scott (God rest his soul) Is outstanding in this film.
294;this film is directed, Acted, and Shot in a manor film directors should take a lesson from.
295;the special effects are great and the photography is super.
296;this is the one to watch.
297;The movie is very well produced.
298;After all these years, it is still one of the greatest horror movies ever!!!
299;What's it about?Regan is a healthy and happy 12 year old girl who lives with her actress.
300;All seems regular untill Regan abruptly becomes prone to unexpected fits and unusual behavior.
301;is it any good?It's amazing how after nearly 40 years this movie can still make you feel like a hampster in a lion's cage.
302;How Linda Blair never won the Oscar beats me, she manages to show innocence through constraint so well, while Ellen Burstyn's performance gives you that real feeling of isolation as a desperate mother unable to protect her child.
303;An exceptional script from William Peter Blatty coupled with great direction and top performances ensure 'The Exorcist' will always stand the test of time.
304;Alot scarier than those looser films like Halloween, The Shining, Silence of the Lambs, The Changeling, The Ring, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen.
305;I've heard it thousands of times, The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time.
306;He is the man who will later be the film's title character.
307;He has faced this enemy before, and he will have to again.
308;the idea that an unwanted spirit can invade someone you love and turn them into something hideous.
309;And it gets more scary every time, right up there with John Carpenter's """"Prince of Darkness,"""" from 1987."""
310;I highly recommend it for a night of edge.
311;seat thrills you won't soon forget.
312;I think that The Exorcist is a very good movie.
313;It is well done, well acted and written and directed.
314;Burstyn is a wonderful, talented actress and she played the role so well, it's like she's not acting!
315;Jason Miller as Preist/Psychiatrist Father Damien Karras is just great.
316;he's very convincing in this important role.
317;Max von Sydow, as old FatherMerrin, is also very, very good.
318;up to look older than he really was, and he still acted great.
319;Wonderfull job that I feel deserved an Oscar.
320;Lee J. Cobb, in a pretty much unimortant and gratuitous role, is still quite stunning.
321;He plays Detective William F. Kinderman, a fan of movies as well as a sly investigator.
322;It's the way she let herself go and just acted that made her performance unforgettable.
323;The directing on this film is quite good.
324;It's been reported that director William Freidkan beat up his cast and crew to get a good reaction on.
325;screen (he even fired guns to make people look surprised) but I beleive that's what made the acting so good.
326;The writing on this is also good.
327;William Peter Blatty adapted his bestseller book into a movie and I think he did a good job.
328;The film has a strong moral behind all the possesion scenes, but it's hard to find.
329;"The second release, the 25th Anniversary Special Edition, was very good, full of extras and a beautiful transfer for the picture and sound, but this ""Version You've Never Seen"" release is slightley better, yet slightley poorer."
330;The picture and sound on this one are far better than the previous release, much less film grain and brighter colors.
331;The sound is in a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack that is quite spectacular.
332;I won't tell you what happens, but it's quite a surprise!
333;There are also some new CGI effects that I feel add to the creepiness, also.
334;the movie, as I said, looks great.
335;Occasional grain comes, but not to often and the print is quite breathtaking (this movie was made in 1973?)
336;It's presented in its original widescreen format and it features a 5.1 track, a Mono, and French sub.
337;The Exorcist really knows how to get under your skin.
338;this happended repeatedly until I managed to see the entire thing in full on video several years later.
339;This movie is unnerving, complex and petrifying.
340;but wow, what a brilliant movie!P.
341;it certainly isn't just the special effects, which are quite good, because they can easily be outdone with today's technology.
342;"This ""Unspoken Something"" I'm referring to is perfectly captured in the opening prologue of the film, that moment at the archeological dig site in Iraq."
343;On a nearby mound stands a statue, a ancient representation of a powerful demon known to the Assyrians and Babylonians as Pazuzu.
344;The essence of this film is encapsulated in this brief moment of realization.
345;The battle for a human soul is about to begin.
346;This movie is very scary!
347;Instead, it relies on the viewer's intellect.
348;There is also an ACTUAL story to it (unlike most films these days)!
349;ized, with all the fun to go along with that), it is well.
350;If you have a Horror Movie fanatic, this one will definitely quench their appetite!
351;A great horror classic that everyone should see at least once in their life if not more!
352;This is one movie that will have beyond high standards if they ever re.
353;The Exorcist is widely known as the scariest movie of all time and I agree.
354;This film is both shocking and very cerebral.
355;The latter part of the movie shows their attempts at exorcism and eventual success despite their deaths.
356;In 2001 a new 'writer's cut' included 11 min.
357;according to me,this movie is kinda funny.
358;moving,But Other Than That It Was Great.
359;"This movie is a classic and for the price
360;The director's cut allows you to see it though the director's eyes.
361;i love this movie because how the story line introduce you to each character and their history .
362;Also, the great fight of Good versus Evil.
363;The acting was amazing and much creepier than some of these slasher movies.
364;I am an avid horror fan, this is a must have version for anyone that is serious about snuggling up with their girlfriend and watching and watching a good scare flick.
365;Alright, it's hard to give this film 5 stars for being a great film (in that I liked it, because I did not), but it is easy to give the film 5 stars because it was so well made.
366;There are a few misconceptions about the movie, the most notable being that many claim little Regan was possessed by the devil.
367;This is one of those rare occasions.
368;I have always said that the Exorcist (the first one) was one of the best horror movies produced.
369;The acting, directing, special effects, etc. are excellent.
370;I will definitely watch this one again, especially since they've added extra scenes.
371;All in all a great watch for horror fans.
372;right at the top of the list of the best of horror films.
373;good stunts that make the skin crawl.
374;The book is surely that good.
375;I'm sure that William Peter Blatty doesn't much mind"
376;"now, the acting in the film is fantastic for sure
377;If you watch the film multiple times, as I have, you will begin to notice some of the subtleties of his acting.
378;The scene where he is having tea (or coffee) in the kitchen with the Ellen Burstyn character in particular is amazing.
379;At any rate, I believe watching this film for Mr. Cobb's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
380;(Jason Miller was excellent as well, as was Max von Sydow, as was Ms. Burstyn, etc. etc.
381;A lot has been made about a potential remake.
382;Also, when something is so good, why redo it?
383;(Yes, I know that Mr. Eastwood is persona non grata at the time of this writing, but I will be a big fan of this American treasure forever.)
384;still awesome even in this day and age!!
385;can never beat an original!
386;When this movie came into the theaters it was one of the best movies.
387;I still jumped in some spots but it was an enjoyable experience.
388;i'm so happy we have come a long way in medicine because the suffering the poor child went through is minimized now.
389;I would definitely recommend this movie for viewing.
390;now, It's one of the movies that have scaried me more in my whole life, and for me, it's the best """"Exorcist"""" movie from all those out there."""
391;it's an almost perfect movie, because of the reasons I just wrote, and that's why I rate it 4/5.
392;But, as it costs only 10 bucks, it totally worth it.
393;I liked it because it was a classic horror movie but I guess after seeing all this new.
394;"My son and I watched it together and I wondered if it would scare him too much (just 11) but he enjoyed it, even the special effects which against today's standards aren't so ""special""."
395;oh we'll, right of passage, I guess!
396;An intense film this is, not so much because of the demon, but because of the horrors that this little girl must endure to ensure her safety.
397;The content of the film is bone.
398;chilling, and it will make you think deeply about God and the soul of every human on earth.
399;This scariest film of all time is entitled.
400;going Catholics to Church every Sunday, and it pretty much scared the living daylights out of every human being on this planet.
401;the face of Pazuzu, one of Satan's diciples.
402;Regan already knows how to work it, so she shows Chris how it's done.
403;school's Regan, who also leaves with Regan and Chris, joins the last few guests of the party around Chris' piano.
404;She arrives home and checks on Regan, where her bedroom window is wide open.
405;he comes back the next day to make sure that this possession is for real.
406;the two arrive at the house, to perform the ritual.
407;He grabs Regan and begins beating her, where he shouts.
408;The whole neighborhood arrives at the scene over Karras' body.
409;the next morning, Chris and Regan prepare to leave their house, for the exorcism is overwith and a complete success, since Chris' movie is now finished.
410;this, as I had stated, is the, if not one of, the scariest movie of all time.
411;This film will forever remaina cult classic.
412;This eternally shocking and sadistic masterpiece is a must.
413;Directed by true maverick William Friedkin, this film also has a great share of noteworthy performances, especially Linda Blair who was only twelve(!!)
414;The plotline also is representative of a common sub.
415;An interesting commentary on science, religion, and faith, as well as a genuinely scary movie even without new.
416;"I was also interested in his comments about how he, like so many writers, clearly experiences himself as a ""channel"" of the creative material that comes to him chiefly from outside himself."
417;After reading some reviews of this revision of The Exorcist movie, which includes extra new scenes and a new, improved soundtrack, I decided I'd like to see it.
418;particularly in light of the fact that the Catholic Church is making exorcism very available lately because of a greatly increasing need for it.
419;i thought the finalizing scenes between the priest who survived (don't recall his name) and Regan, and then between that priest and the policeman, were a very good addition which helped to give a proper closure to the story.
420;The atmosphere is loaded with suspense from start to finish with very artistic renderings of visual foreshadowing.
421;Plus the acting and character development is top notch.
422;The special effects are a bit antiquated but very well done for the time of the production.
423;this is a true American horror classic.
424;Although the effects are clearly a generation old, they are still every bit as effective as the new glitzy ones.
425;Yes, very good movie and scary!!
426;the film begins with the haunting chant of a middle eastern prayer in Iraq as Father Merrin (Sydow) unearths ancient ruins and something else, but what appeals to most is the build.
427;Ifn this is the scariest movie, then people are scared really, really easy.
428;One of the most classic horror stories of all time.
429;It is as frightening today as it was in the 70's.
430;Truly a masterpiece and timeless classic.
431;Based on the Novel by William Peter Blatty, who win an Oscar for Best Adapated Screenplay from his Novel makes this Horror Film an True Classic.
432;This film also Win an Oscar for Best Sound.
433;The Film was Oscar Nominated for Best Director, Best Actress.
434;ellen Burstyn, Best Art Director(Set Decoration), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture.
435;This film was Good Supporting Performance, including.
436;This is a real horror classic.
437;And, until this day, the scariest one.
438;I went to see the Director's Cut without any question, in a large theatre with TXS sound system.
439;The added scenes are really good.
440;my thoughts: Back in 1985, I was Christian.
441;on a religion based on Guilt, this is just natural.
442;Maybe they didn't love their God as much as I love my cat.
443;i just loved that film.
444;"Whatever, this ""new"" release with added footage to the original is still as gripping today as it was nearly 30 years ago (Linda Blair's cascade down the staircase is the strongest added punch)."
445;It's both, splendidly melded in a package of primal fear that also challenges the demons that everyone carries, the challenge being whether our own private faiths can survive the invasion of pure evil.
446;Ellen Burstyn is, as usual, exceptional in projecting her character's sheer desperation in rescuing her daughter from her satanic invader, and the late Jason Miller is perfect as the priest struggling with his own crisis of faith until he meets the devil face to face in this icy little bedroom.
447;"Max von Sydow balances the desperation of Chris MacNeil and challenged faith of Father Karras with the dignity and undeniable faith of ""The Exorcist."""
448;Incredibly, after dozens of viewings, the film still manages to impale its viewer with a fear of the unknown.
449;With all said and done, though, we do at least get the hope that divine goodness can save us.
450;I got this movie last night for Halloween.
451;For jews (unlike christians) the devil is one of god's powers and never works independently with his own free will.
452;As a horror film it isn't much (good thing though, since I don't think much of horror films).
453;As a psychological thriller though, it's excellent.
454;While it has some shock and scare value, the true force behind this film is its implementation of psychology and human weakness.
455;Herein lies the strong psychological aspect of the film.
456;The film deals with the forces of good and evil in a clear.
457;This quite simply in my opinion is the best horror if not the best movie I have ever seen.
458;the actors were tremendous to the point that I don't believe any other actors could have done better.
459;possibly the best horror film ever made, this film with its religious undertones, travels deep into our minds and stings the brain with excitement and suspense.
460;All the performances are incredible, as is the cinematography and the music score.
461;Keep that in mind and be prepared to be plunged into a horrifying journey.
462;all's well in a nice house in the States except one thing: a young girl named Regan is possessed by a demon.
463;Her odd demeanor certainly alarms her mother, an actress, as well as other housemates.
464;the film however shines in its acting with Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and of course Linda Blair.
465;When I finally saw it with a friend.
466;Linda Blair was amazing as the young girl who was possed.
467;Hats off for a spooky movie well done.
468;This is the kind of movie that messes with your head.
469;Kept me up at night.
470;I recommend this movie to anyone with a strong stomach, and doesn't scare easy.
471;the special effects still hold up.
472;the film does an excellent job of convincing even the most ardent atheist that demons do exist, that there really is a devil, and that he is not to be taken lightly.
473;That's the best and most complete version of this terrifying film.
474;After all these year's, The Exorcist is still the most harrowing film of all time.
475;And it will remind the younger audience of just what constitute's really great horror!!
476;The acting was great and done very well.
477;This adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel is nothing short of stunning and shows that multiu.
478;generated special effects here, although at the time of it's release the movie proved to be a real special effectds event.
479;It's sharp, forboding and builds an amazing sense of fear within the viewer as the story of a little girl's possession by an evil sprit is played out over roughly 80 or 90 minutes.
480;There is one scene in the movie called the spider walk you will have to see the movie to know what it is,but it is the best scene in the whole movie.
481;I would also not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18.
482;I surprised my boyfriend with it, and we watched it that night.
483;The payment and shipping was extremely easy!
484;I received it in the mail a day earlier than planned!
485;Minimal special effects and very convincing acting by Linda Blair.
486;This movie will stick with you for many years to come.
487;This movie has great writing, great characters, and cinematography.
488;First things first: This 3rd party seller was fantastic.
489;ray version of this film is beautiful.
490;"there are many, and such an excellent compliment to ""The Exorcist."""
491;For new and previous fans, these extras are fantastic.
492;i wish all of our classic films received this level of attention and care when transferred to Blu.
493;Watching this on a widescreen plasma television, lights down low, is an incredible experience.
494;ray/2250/In my teens, I bought the film on VHS.
495;"And now, after all of these years, this is the version that, without hyperbole, brings ""The Exorcist"" to life."
496;extras are important, and if they are worth it, as a consumer, I will happily add the product to my collection.
497;Best scary movie by far!
498;I envy those who find this film so remarkably frightening, as it really doesn't strike me as particularly scary .
499;The additional material brings the film much more in line with Blatty's original vision, and I find it a little strange that director William Friedkin seems to get most of the credit for this new version of the film when he was the one who cut the respective scenes in the first place and, in some cases, resisted their inclusion in this special re.
500;Linda Blair, in a truly remarkable performance, plays Regan MacNeil, the sweet and innocent twelve.year.
501;the Exorcist truly is a powerful movie experience, filled with several of the most shocking scenes to ever appear on film.
502;I was surprised that so many of the more controversial aspects of the story actually made it from novel to screen, especially in the original 1973 incarnation of the film.
503;"The demonic manifestations and exorcism are done extremely well in the movie
504;The movie adds several things to the exorcism itself that do not appear in the novel and, by and large, gives the exorcism itself more prevalence than Blatty himself did, yet it also manages to capture and express quite well the inner struggle and soul.
505;This inner struggle of good vs evil, of faith vs hopelessness strikes me as the heart of this story, and the movie communicates this surprisingly well.
506;the added scenes in this updated version of the film are crucial to the integrity of the story, though there are of course other fans who will argue that the new scenes do damage to the power and vision of the original.
507;I'm a fan of older horror movies, and honestly.
508;This movie definitely looked good!
509;One of the best horror movies, even compared to today's.
510;The Exorcist is my favorite movie movie of all time.
511;One of the best films of all time, The Exorcist on blu.
512;ray is a must for any fan!
513;this one,with deleted scenes restored,made seeing it seem like the first time.
514;i'm a fan of Linda Blair and I love her work,giving the movie some beauty to contrast the ugliness of the story.
515;great movie that gives a more in.
516;The added trailers and extra's on this version are great at helping us to remember it's only a movie, HOWEVER this is one age old story of good vs evil which I don't believe will ever stop frightening people.
517;This movie will continue to scare because the fear produced is rooted deep within our own psyche.
518;The movie leaves you with images and thoughts which have the ability to transform your moments alone into a living hell.
519;It is a fear that goes far beyond what we can see with our eyes.
520;beyond the ability of the movie to scare the hell out of you (or into you), the movie also seems to depict another basic theme of the human search for answers to life's big questions.
521;release to the big screen has also yielded successful box office figures proving it one of the classic horror films of all time.
522;This is easily the scariest movie ever made, but you actually have to have an attention span, to fully enjoy this film.
523;Scarier than The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, The Ring, The Shining, Silence of the Lambs, and The Evil Dead!
524;A beast of a movie!
525;Great acting,great direction,great effects(for their time),and of course,a great screenplay authored by none other than Bill Blatty himself.
526;coming Sept.22 to a theater near you with startling new footage.
527;Some members of the '90210 , I Know What You Did Last Summer generation might watch this film and laugh!
528;Where is the respect and appreciation for the classics?
529;this is it, and I didn't even see the re.
530;Still at the top of my list for scariest movie of all time.
531;top obsenity)where this film scares most is on a psycholological level.
532;The mood of the film is enhanced by great cinematography, particularly it's chilly, damp Georgetown setting.
533;There is a superb cast here led by Ellen Burstyn as the distraught mother, Chris MacNeil.
534;It is this character that adds heft to most of the film.
535;It's amazing how this landmark movie still holds it's power 30 years after it's initial release.
536;But I would like to touch on two things, the added scenes in the latest version are great.
537;Linda Blair just does such a great job in this movie, it's really a shame her career took such a nose.
538;It was like watching a """"new"""" movie with enhanced audio, and with surround sound """"Tubular Bells"""" has never sounded better."""
539;well the newest version is well worth the money.
540;The picture was good considering the source material.
541;The new 3 part documentary is amazing and show never before seen behind the scenes footage from stuff they filmed on set.
542;The Spider walk scene looks great in the 2000 version of the movie.
543;I hadn't seen this since it was released, and it really holds up.
544;the one thing that makes this film truly scary is the STYLE of the film.
545;the acting of the main characters especially Linda Blair as the little girl, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Jason Miller as the priest are exceptional.
546;the sound effects are amazing and the imagery is shocking in places eg.
547;the demon knows more than we do and can cause us to doubt our faith and can even read our minds and that is what makes it truly scary.
548;the degeneration of a beautiful little girl into a demonic beast is really well done.
549;finally the screenplay is also excellent and this is because it is done by the author of the book William Peter Blatty so it has not been compromised.
550;"Many people rank 1973's ""The Exorcist"" right up there as one of the best, the scariest, and the most disturbing motion pictures of all time."
551;It's a movie that possesses that magic combination of elements to unsettle almost anyone watching it.
552;I imagine even those who think they are immune to being scared by simply a movie find themselves getting a shiver or two during some of the classic and well.
553;remembered scenes that are in this film.
554;An eerie scene to be sure, as we begin to wonder what forces are lurking within this cute, innocent little girl.
555;disquieting element of the unknown that makes this movie so powerful and nail.
556;But, as things turned out, the protracted and grueling production schedule was more than worth it .
557;considering the outstanding final results on screen.
558;director William Friedkin did a masterful job of unfolding the plot in a natural and well.
559;this review is for the 25th Anniversary Special Edition Widescreen boxed set (VHS Edition), which includes a great package of neat stuff.
560;In addition to a nice.
561;"looking Widescreen (1.85:1) version of ""The Exorcist"", this deluxe set also includes the following collectible items:>> A terrific 52."

565;notch featurette that is well worth seeing, which includes the likes of cast and crew interviews, screen test footage, and some outtakes not previously seen.
566;"warner Home Video allows us to bring the terror of ""The Exorcist"" right into our homes via this attractive deluxe boxed set."
567;This is a most worthy addition to any horror.
568;It draws you into the life of this family and the story of this young girl, who gets posessed by a demon who claims to be the devil himself.
569;The great thing about the Exorcist is that it was made way before it's time.
570;This is an absolute classic one to watch at least 3 times a year.
571;Great story and gross/ alarming effects.
572;The presence of true evil is well conveyed.
573;The ancient Babylonian demon, Pazuzu, unearthed by a priest in modern Iraq, returns, this time to a house in Georgetown in which a little girl and her mother live.
574;This film, based on William Peter Blatty's novel, explores the battles between the physical and the metaphysical, between body and soul (cf: Lieutenant Kinderman in his conversation with Father Karras).
575;educated son, an oblate, a psychological eunuch, serves God and his dying Church, both ultimately leading to the priest's profound crisis of faith.
576;The added footage in the doctor's office is brilliant.
577;These very real scenes help build the suspense and horror later to be manifested.
578;offs(Abbey), and even spoofs (Repossessed,Scary Movie 2) The original 1973 thriller,The Exorcist is still the scariest movie ever made.
579;The family moved away from Mount Rainier, MD and converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism.
580;Still a hair raising chiller to behold with real acting and a great story line plus the surprise ending.
581;Great performances by Ellen Burstyn as a worried mother and Jason Miller as a priest with doubts.
582;I thought Max Von Sydow was truly great.
583;His performance was subtle but powerful.
584;Three friends and I went to see it, and I was one of the people you heard about on the news who came running out of the theater screaming bloody murder from sheer terror.
585;Lots of exorcism movies have been made since then and I've watched them, but not one comes close to this one.
586;It's very good, but very scary.
587;It is, possibly, one of the most demanding and disturbing films ever produced both on a visual and thematic level.
588;the agony of the mother, the doubt and inner turmoil of Karras, and the serene and hugely heroic Merrin.
589;the ritual exorcisim is verbatim and the movie examines spiritual problems, both in and outside the Seminary where some of it is shot.
590;Upon it's initial release the majority of movie goers thought that the devil actually won the battle, which both Blatty and Friedkin admitted shocked them at the time.
591;There is a close up of Dyer's collar, and even though Regan doesn't remember any of it, the significance is shattering and moving.
592;Jason Miller still shines in the role of Karras, the priest with all the doubts and anguish, but who finally finds his faith again at the expense of his own life.
593;The Exorcist will affect anyone that sees it but people of the Catholic faith more than any other.
594;"It's always interesting to see Syndow in this role and compare it to the role of Jesus he portrayed in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""."
595;"Indeed, Cushing himself stated that he could never have portrayed a part in the movie as ""it was too like reality"" He always viewed his films as fantasy or dark fairy tales."
596;If I had one quip to make it would have been the spider walk sequence, which seems out of place and breaks the concentration slightly, but otherwise it is as close as they come to a masterpiece, of terror, of darkness, but of the triumph of universal light over that dark.
597;"When compared with other William Friedkin films the gritty realisim is there, but ""The Exorcist"" will always stand alone from them, like a lonely but strangely noble figure, even though ""French Connection"", ""Crusing"" and ""To Live and Die in LA"", are just as matter of fact and treat their subjects with just as much sincerity."
598;"The complete version does say a lot more, but in a subtle way and the fact that it is 31 years old and still is the most provocative films ever, when all the movies once labelled ""infamous"" have led us to wonder what all the fuss was about, puts ""The Exorcist"" in the front rank of truely original movies, and one that will never lose it's power and effect."
599;Thank you amazon for having movies.
600;Director William Friedkin assembled an excellent cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn (Oscar nominated), Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller (Oscar nominated) and Max Von Sydow for this classic thriller.
601;The disc is close to perfection with just a few scenes there is some grain but overall one will be pleased with this transfer.
602;the acting of Linda Blair is wonderful, and the others do a great job as well.
603;nothing to dislike, this is a classic movie that will scare anybody that sees it.
604;While the special effects are not as spectacular as today's, the theme and the fact that it is based on truth makes it more terrifying.
605;Soon, she gets more possesed, saying a stream of swear words and doing supernatural things.
606;the Exorcist is very spooky.
607;"What chills me about that is the freaky ""music"" that you hear when you see it."
608;Very chilling if you turn the volume up.
609;even after all this time this movie holds its own with other horror movies.
610;and whats cool you get 2 movies.
611;so exorcist fans everywhere i recomend this movie.
612;a lot of the movie is just shock value.
613;There's no fancy CGI in this one, just good ol' special effects makeup, but the story line holds this one together well.
614;I was surprised when I saw how clear the picture was!
615;This is one of the all time scariest movies, in my opinion!
616;I know the movie content is great!
617;The Exorcist was notable for being one of the biggest box.
618;And it remains one of the few horror films nominated for Best Picture.
619;Roman Polanski's successful Rosemary's Baby (1968) played upon similar fears of devil possession.

622;inhabited girl, enhanced scenes with Father Merrin (played by the brilliant central actor Max von Sydow who based his performance on the real.
623;We thought it improved the film.
624;david: ***out of***I was very impressed with this film.
625;I consider it to be the scariest film ever made!
626;It's intense and extreme, and shouldn't be ignored.
627;He devotes considerable energy to the development of his characters, especially Father Damien Karras.
628;This role is portrayed perfectly by the sad.
629;"faced Jason Miller
630;Take it seriously and watch it alone in the dark.
631;I also consider it the scariest movie ever made.
632;gothic mannerisms of William Peter Blatty's novel, so effectively adapted to the screen by director William Friedkin, will provide an opportunity for a generation jaded by increasingly gruesome and gratuitous slasher flicks a chance to see how it can be done without sacrificing the crafty build up of suspense and subtle development of character.
633;One that absolutely must be viewed in the dark.
634;The special effects, which are key to creating half a dozen scenes that have entered film lore, retain every bit of their enormous initial impact.
635;In my opinion it is the scariest flick ever!This is a horror film that has stood the test of time and has scared audiences for generations.
636;Not only is it a great horror film,it is a great film period!
637;A good film about a 12 year old girl who is being possessed by a demon, and 2 catholic priests are called upon to try to save her.
638;It is a shocking movie in terms of content and certain physical attributes, but the real story that lies within the material is something much stronger than a simple tale of exorcism.
639;opening film experience as much as it is an eye.
640;known, but enough to throw expensive parties and afford some help around the house.
641;To watch the way in which Karras must resist these lies is compelling and masterful.
642;the movie is also not without its share of brilliant casting, boasting some stunning performances from Max von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn.
643;Von Sydow gives Merrin's character a stable and forceful demeanor, while Burstyn's Chris Macneil is emotional while never becoming too whiny.
644;she is able to sell us on her character's fear for her daughter's life.
645;Linda Blair, in one of the most challenging roles in history, perfectly segues from cheery to eerie, with help of a little make.
646;It is a psychological journey that is religiously truthful and revealing, while also dotting itself with small physical horror elements and twists.
647;Very good movie , good ralization, the girl was had a great performance.
648;very scary scenes and good actors I love it
649;I remember when this movie first came out and it was super and it still is.
650;The graphics and scenes were great and it was easy to follow.
651;Exorcist is a good cult movie.
652;Great extras and both common versions will please them.
653;Because this is what is really happens in real life the devil is real so take a look what I mean
654;Very realistic portrayal of a possesion.
655;The extra footage adds to an already great movie.
656;I saw on the big screen in 1973 and still enjoy it very much today.
657;Good one of the classic horror films you need to watch in order to call yourself a horror enthusiast xD
658;Ther are alot of great, unforgettable horror films out there that still burn in the back of our minds to this day.
659;What I really liked about it was that it didn't just jump to the possession of Regan McNiel"
660;It really never lets you go!
661;but still a great movie.
662;ellen Burnstyn was nominated Best Actress for The Exorcist(1973),William Friedkin was nominated Best Director, Linda Blair ultimately won for best supporting actress for her role as Megan,the young girl who becomes possed by satin himself.
663;a great film and one of my personal favorites.
664;the transfer is very close to the orignal source material,Warner Bros. comes through again in keeping their classic titles true to the film's origanal look.
665;both are excellent with plenty of surround activity especally in the rear surrounds this is a pretty beefy soundtrack for a movie from 1973.
666;the Exorcist is nicely packaged in a 2 disc digibook form with 38 pages of full color and b&w photos with tid bits on the movie the book has a beautiful gloss finish a nice edition for any Blu.
667;This is one of those movies that is so great you must own it, and yet you never watch it!
668;And that is a total testament to how powerful this really is.
669;yet also my least favorite to watch.
670;This new version is far scarier than the original, the updated, soundrack sends chills through your bones and the added subliminal effects with the added scenes will chill you right down to your core.
671;I think this movie will go on for years and years and always be the scariest movie ever made, because it's what you don't understand or your beliefs or what you don't believe about this movie that makes it scary.
672;If you plan on not sleeping for a while then this is the movie to see.
673;In my opinion it's considered the scariest movie of all time 33 years after it's initial release and can't wait until I have a copy of it.
674;I liked this Movie all over actors,casting Drama I recommend watching this movieIt was very realistic, and very scary
675;And it was produced without the benefit of today's super.
676;the acting and the direction still hold up very well.
677;As for the doubters and sarcastic disbelievers, this movie was based on a true event which took place in 20th century Baltimore.
678;But if you're interested in a solidly produced and directed flick, enjoy this movie.
679;and then, by all means, read the excellent book.
680;My grandchildren really enjoyed it, even if the small one was sort of scared.
681;It arrived on time and in good condition, I will recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies with a little excitement.
682;I love horror movies and this of course is one of my all time favoites.
683;Willim Freikin and the special effects crew take no prisioners with strong gore and a realistic feeling of evil.
684;To my supries the eleavation sceen near the end with the girl is very moving in my opinion.
685;Ellen Burstyn gives this her very best as the mother.
686;Max Von Sydow gives this his very best as the priest.
687;One of the classic films of our time.
688;Great performances by the cast.
689;Visual effects are frighteningly realistic and the dialog is superb.
690;It will have you on the edge of your seat.
691;as we tend to forget sometimes, the opening scenes of this film presage RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK in a stunning, excellent way.
692;What is familiar is this starts with hearth.
693;a. button girl who will wind up being the demon's plaything, and so much stunning, groundbreaking cinematography.Yes, even today it retains its shock value though it is, inevitably turning to schlock value (but we can still appreciate that, can't we).
694;What I found the most cinematically satisfying is in the details, but a detail in particular I have always loved so much I have tried to copy it in real life: Father Merrin's re.
695;entrance into the film just around a half hour before the end.
696;i bought one just like it and wore it for over a decade.
697;But that is what great cinema can do.
698;This is damned good film right down to its legendary soundtrack, end of story.
699;This is as personal as I ever get in reviews, but I will say it anyway: true evil in a very real form is portrayed here and kids ought not to see such things.
700;, this powerful film is referred to as if it were camp because the special effects cannot match those possible twenty years later.
701;i would recommend that one read the book in advance, because it has far more dimensions and character development than the film version.
702;Basic elements of the story are excised .
703;it remains an engrossing film, but I believe viewers would not have minded an extra hour's length which could have allowed the film version to approach the book's excellence.
704;This movie is best watched with the lights on and definately not alone.
705;Repossessed is a comical spoof of the original which (also starred a grown.
706;up Linda Blair who called the film cathartic, or so she had said) was probably the best one, but it's also lampooned in Scarey Movie as well as others.
707;The debate which raged after publication of Blatty's book gained even greater force following the movie: Does good triumph in the end, or did the Devil win?
708;"regardless of perspective, the movie still continues to provoke feelings of discomfort and terror, not the least since it is an ""innocent"" which is possessed in the first place."
709;"it is, perhaps, the emotional response to what one is witnessing, the villification of what is an innocent in all respects, and one's acceptance of that innocent and helpless child as evil incarnate to all but, perhaps, Marrin, who is ultimately destroyed by ""her"", that makes the film so horrifying."
710;Truly one of the first films to ever bring the concept of complete despair to modern horror.
711;It's a film about the mystery of faith.
712;well, everyone has their own opinion.
713;The acting is simply outstanding.
714;It is actually a very spiritual film.
715;"The music will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, the sound goes from loud to soft which really gets to you, and the scenes of horror will give you that ""roller coaster ride"" feeling that will stick with you for a long time."
716;This film is so realistic.
717;"If you have already seen this movie and haven't seen the new footage of the infamous ""Spider Walk"", you have to see it!One of the greatest movies ever made."
718;Brilliant, intelligent, spiritual, and shocking.
719;turn all the lights off and enjoy.
720;The horrific images of the possessed Regan McNeil forever seared into my consciousness aside, one truly heart.
721;William Friedkin's frightening, disturbing vision that is The Exorcist continues to haunt the dreams of a new generation of movie.
722;It is definitely one movie to watch with ALL the lights in the house on!
723;A Great Movie, Now On Blue.
724;AND THE ORIGINAL TRAILERS FOR THE FILM.
725;Many deal with zombies, ghosts, serial killers, classic monsters like Frankenstein, and mutated species.
726;While my favorite horror film of all time is actually The Shining, I can perfectly understand why The Exorcist is considered the best.
727;First of all, is has an unusual storyline (back in the 70's, at least).
728;so why is it that this is considered the scariest movie of all time.
729;The Exorcist, especially, is one that is truly scary because of its controversial subject matter.
730;I consider this a classic with great special effects, especially for that time!
731;Have watched it numerous times over the years and continue to enjoy watching it
732;This is a classic scare flick however, with possession being a real thing, should we really be entertained by this?
733;A highly original and grotesquely disturbing film that makes the unbelievable subject of demonic possession believable.
734;Regan (Linda Blair), the sweet and lovable daughter of a famous actress (Ellen Burstyn) is suddenly struck down with a rare, cerebral disorder.
735;Another frightening aspect of the film is the extremely well done make.
736;Regan's face, in the final stages of her possession is unsettling.
737;It's very easy for the viewer to forget that they are looking at a very young girl.
738;But as frightening as the visuals are, in my opinion the most disturbing aspect of the film is the sound effects.
739;At times, the voice is deep and masculine.
740;The star of the vocal effects is Mercedes McCambridge and she must be credited for the incredible work she did in the film.
741;also impressive are the performances from the cast, many whom received Oscar nominations.
742;acting and the characters are given an emotional depth and human element that is rare in horror pictures, at least the horror films of today.
743;But for those wanting to experience the ultimate in first.
744;Everything you'd expect from a first rate and unforgettable horror masterpiece.
745;I did think it was an excellent psychology thriller and it was so nice to see a complete and believable backstory in this sort of movie.
746;I think it's held up to the passage of time very well and it seldom felt dated.
747;for the time period, the effects and make up were extremely well done, particularly the age make up on Father Merrin(I believe the actor was in his 40's).
748;I kept reading reviews saying that even today it will keep you from sleeping well for weeks on end.
749;In fact , I took a nap right after watching it!
750;overall, I enjoyed the film a great deal and I'm glad that I saw it.
751;Every scene seems spooky and eerie, especially the priest's dreams of her mother.
752;This movie is a classic, and if nobody excepts it, they don't what good horror filmmaking is!
753;Good special effects for such an old movie.
754;All the lude remarks made by little Regan during the exorcism to the Priests is rather funny.
755;There is no doubt some of the visuals in this film will haunt you especially if you live in a house which has a second floor.
756;This is the beauty of this film that it takes place in such an ordinary setting where millions live thus giving the impression, it can happen to you.
757;The pacing also works well though after a few viewings it does get boring.
758;"The best part of this special edition is the movie trailor that comes with it
759;Its a classic no doubt about it and well done for its time but it has gotten old as well and movie goers have also gotten more sophisticated.
760;A classic this film, recommended.
761;good script, good direction and excellent photography.
762;a classic this film, recommended.
763;Like most stories based on truth (or maybe a version of truth in this case) the author took what he could find and exacerbated the situation to provide for a more exciting and terrifying read.
764;made in 1973 it is a wonder this film even made it to the big screen.
765;In this edition several more scenes are added, one of which is the impressive special effect of Regan walking down the stairs backwards on her hands and feet.
766;all in all the story is phenomenal, the drama and terror reigns supreme, and the fantastic use of special effects for the time period gets hearts racing and minds racing even faster.
767;I believe that this is one of the scariest horror movies of all time.
768;taking William Peter Blatty's rich and excellent screenplay, director William Friedkin takes it to the next level and delivers a powerfully tight and scary film.
769;this was helped, of course, by the wonderful performances given by Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Linda Blair, Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller and the rest of the cast.
770;Watch the movie and enjoy!
771;It makes you feel you are actually faced with real evil.
772;If you like to experience fear in the safety of your chair, this is for you!
773;My brother and three other friends finally get into the theatre.
774;William Friedkin is a genius.
775;Silence of the Lambs, another great movie.
776;I have watched this movie a dozen times and always find something new that I overlooked.
777;That is film making at it's best.
778;My brother and three other friends finally get into the theatre and the movie starts.
779;The Silence of the Lambs (another great movie).
780;I have watched this movie a dozen times and each time I pick up something new from.
781;Another beautiful scene that I overlooked was when Ellen Burstyns walks home and we get to hear that unfogettable music and see the nun's garments flow in the wind.
782;That is film making at it' best.
783;I now get to enjoy for what it is, a great piece of film making and yes I still jump when I hear that phone ring (if you haven't seen the movie you will not understand).
784;I think that this movie looks absolutely phenomenal, as opposed to the original version.
785;def collector', containing both versions (I personally think the original theatrical version is still the best), with a whole range of interesting extras and comments.
786;One of the best movies in this genre.
787;Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
788;This may well be the most satisfying blu.
789;ray releases will be like this.
790;The content is usually very informative and useful and it is certainly the case here.
791;But all in all if I had to choose between the two I'd say the Thearetical Version is good as is that is until my Reviewer's Cut is made :.)
792;It was very touching watching this transformation of Karas' character from the start of the film to the very end.
793;For me the most important and most memorable scene of the entire film was the one at the bottom of the stairs after the older priest sends Karas out of the room because he was not cutting it and when the mother asks if Regan was going to die and as if in a Garden of Gethsemane moment Karas steels himself and decides no way!
794;ray] this film is a great picture to encourage Christians everywhere.
795;All the demon succeeded in doing was to give yet another opportunity for Self.
796;very disturbing if you are seeing it for the first time and I can only imagine how much more of the case that was in the 1970s but if you pay attention to the characters and all the storylines it is also among the most rewarding film experiences that you are likely to have.
797;the Exorcist is a great story which will affect you for a brief time mainly because the location where all the story takes place is in a house thus suggesting that this could happen to your family.
798;It uses psychology to make its mark and it succeeds quite well.
799;On its own Possession/exorcism is quite an interesting topic but if this is an irrefutable phenomenon why haven't we seen a genuine case being reported about recently.
800;She would often smile at the camera when she thought she was in the clear.
801;Another thing one has to ask, is this the best the devil can do?
802;For those who believe without a doubt, such things are true then take comfort that there are forces to combat them.
803;When he read about the 1949 case and got his inspiration it provided an excellent springboard for him.
804;a+ due to the fact it's a classic I would rate it B. today.
805;Now, I love to watch fun horror films, the kind that scare you but also give you quite a bit of entertainment, and even some humor.
806;For those of you who love scary movies, even if they aren't intellectually stimulating and entertaining, see this movie.
807;But, for those of you who enjoy fun, suspenseful, intellectually stimulating and yet still horrific films, see something like """"Cape Fear"""" instead."""
808;This movie was good , i mean classics are always good.
809;they remake The Exorcist alot but the 1973 version is the best.
810;That the makers of this film managed to base the storyline upon religion, the most ancient and explored theme of civilisation, and produce this chillingly compulsive masterpiece with such an original feel and atmosphere is an achievement unto itself.
811;That it also manages to entertain at least in equal amount to the classic book from which the movie is derived is more remarkable still.
812;I also base this on the final conversation between the priest and the detective.
813;Suffice to say, it is a cross between the act of urination and two trips to a place they keep animals.
814;It's always on my top 5 favorite movies of all time list.
815;While others drop off this is always on it!
816;About 6 months later it made it to my local theater in Brooklyn and I waited on an enormous line to see it again.
817;ray edition is the best edition I've seen yet.
818;The picture and sound are obviously excellent.
819;It is interesting to see how young Max Von Sydow actually was when he made The Exorcist.
820;It is interesting to note that Blatty states his objections several times to labeling The Exorcist a horror film, he prefers a religious suspense thriller.
821;"(For the record, I still think ""Psycho"" is the scariest film ever made.)"
822;time classic is the one to get.
823;The expanded ending changes the tone and mood of the film and the digital retouches add some more subliminal Easter eggs.
824;But, It does compile a sort of interest to you, and I would have to say that this movie was very good!
825;For example, at the beginning of the book, Regan and her mother get out and tour around the area.
826;They should have added this part to apply the close relationship the two characters shared.
827;But, this is still a great movie, and I recommend you read the book if you enjoyed the movie(vise.
828;I thought this movie was very good.
829;I have no doubt that this is the scariest movie ever made.
830;This is a movie that will effect you emotionally in a number a horrifying ways.
831;Proof that the sound of a film can and will have just as much impact on you as the visuals will.
832;The bonus material is first rate.
833;I watched the movie 3 times in a row and I can still see all that happened even with the cuts they made it is and will always be a classic horror show that will never be beat by any other show trying to!!
834;and she always laughs and says, you wanted to see it.
835;One of the best, (if not the best), horror films ever made, period.
836;The special effects are really not as impressive as when I first viewed it.
837;If you've never seen this movie, I would recommend it, as it will probably give you a good scare, depending on just how sweamish you are.
838;It is considered a classic, even 40 years later.
839;It's terrifying, dramatic, compelling, edge of your seat entertainment.
840;Don't let the date it was made scare you off, this film is still amazing even today.
841;It is the most gripping film ever, a major roller coaster ride of a movie that once you get on, there's no getting off.
842;this movie brings out emotions inside you that have never been used.
843;When watching it, you feel your whole life revolving around the movie, swirling uncontrollably.
844;Even with the huge feeling you get to turn to movie off at extremely intense parts is overcome by your passion to keep your eyes glued to the screen, trying not even to blink.
845;these are the feelings I got while watching, and I'm guessing most every human would experience them too.
846;All else is fine, packaging, commentary, and other special features worth checking out.
847;don't consider yourself a brave person until you have seen The Exorcist.
848;See this.you won't be sorry you took the time you did.
849;But nothing has come close to the sheer terror created in this masterpiece.
850;Watch it alone, in the dark.
851;Tubular Bells will continue to play in your mind forever.
852;I truly, truly wish that I were around to see this movie when it first came out.
853;So, throughtout the movie, I kept in mind that back then, this kind of thing was very rare to witness, and it helped a little.
854;some parts DID make us jump, though, so it hasn't lost ALL of it's appeal.
855;Linda Blair does a wonderful job playing the poor girl that degrades from a innocent girl to the Devil himself, and the special effects are the best thing next to computer animation, so I give it four stars because it has good special effects, good acting.
856;and hey, it's a classic!
857;Now I can watch it and even laugh at parts of it.
858;it is a keep sake of acting especially for the young Linda Blair.
859;Thank heavens they ended up with the cast they did !
860;One of the wonderful things about this film is the cast, after all.
861;They all play their roles to perfection.
862;Linda Blair especially displays brilliance in the role of the sweet as pie pre teen girl who becomes possessed by a demon, wreaking havoc with her mind, body and surrounds.
863;even though the movie starts with a slower pace, it holds your interest, right from the opening scenes through to the nerve shattering finale.
864;This film was a masterpiece of special effects way before they were common place and still easily holds it's own today.
865;release with a few extra scenes.
866;overall, I recommend this timeless masterpiece to anyone not too squeamish to watch it.
867;Bound to stay a masterpiece forever.
868;It was and is one of my favorite movies .
869;scariness aside this was an excellent, powerful drama with incredible performances from all involved.
870;I myself thought the story flowed very nicely, and I actually cared about the characters by the end of the film.
871;Plus a decent bit of extras including a feature length commentary with the director.
872;The Exorcist still contains scenes that are undeniably shocking .
873;A sinister, economical score soundtracks a documentary style of direction that plunges the viewer into the very core of the insanity.
874;Luckily, I was wearing a strong shirt .
875;And that's exactly what they did.
876;which still holds up after all this time.
877;File Disc 1 with all your Eli Roth movies and keep the original version handy for a good scare!
878;The exorcist has been around for decades, and can still make adults who see it for the first time, jumpy.
879;a good cast, good acting, and a great story.
880;The Exorcist theme, Tubular Bells (Mike Oldfield), is just as eerie and mysterious as the movie.
881;Great way the suspense is built in this movie.
882;This movie has definitely earned its reputation as a classic among the horror movie community.
883;The Exorcist was able to fulfill my desires.
884;I was searching for a movie that left you with an uneasy feeling, excellent directing, was actually scary and so forth.
885;I still haven't found the perfect horror movie and I may have to make it myself.
886;Yet his mom actually loved the film in the end.
887;as for the actors, they all did fantastic jobs.
888;The person who did the voice for the possessed young Regan was amazing.
889;But then again, maybe that is the price of a masterpiece.
890;I'm going to give this Movie 5 stars because it deserves it.
891;Just keep in mind that if you are not the religious type this may not scare you, but you will be able to witness a great movie anyways.
892;There was talk that the story was based on the demonic possession of a Hollywood celebrity's child, we all knew who and we all believed it!
893;It was a glorious media .
894;Very powerful movie that scares to death.
895;"watch this movie
896;It is and always will be the SCARIEST movie ever.
897;I received fast arrival and it arrived in excellent condition!
898;:(This is this a well written, directed and acted REALLY SCARY MOVIE!
899;This classic is the main reason i bought my player.
900;The extra features are cool!
901;There's just one seen added and a remasterd sound and color job.
902;I have seen this movie at least 10 times, and still find it worth watching again.
903;This movie is so realistic makes one think.
904;Very scary thought that seems so possible , I know most would laugh , but u see this movie and anything seems possible.
905;excellent cast all had fantastic acting skills , good old school directing.
906;great screenplay, acting, visual and sound effects and music too!
907;Many films that get the big studio reissue treatment come and go with ad campaigns that promise pristine prints, new scenes or new sound treatments.
908;This past year, THE EXORCIST got the reissue only a true film classic deserves.
909;This 27 year old film outgrossed new movies that were up against it in it's rerelease.
910;My God, this movie is good.
911;The Exorcist is scary and disturbing, even by todays standards, and still a classic.
912;It is really a classic film so if you haven't watched it yet then What are you waiting for?!?
913;It's a classic, so I wanted to have seen it, but it's good by old cinema standards and I found it cheesy.
914;I would certainly rate this movie amongst my favourites of all time.
915;The whole movie is gripping and harrowing.
916;This is an essential view for anyone who loves a good gruesome shock now and then
917;Through the years, the popular superstitions have found countless episodes of apparitions and demons.
918;At last the girl was saved and the film too, from being awarded, thanks God.
919;Just the movie I wanted a very classic horror thank you so much for your prompt service and look forward to doing business in the near future
920;ray player and want to see the absolute best version of The Exorcist you've EVER seen.
921;this is simply THE way to view it!
922;Based on William Peter Blatty's novel, """"The Exorcist"""", William Friedkin's 1973 classic horror movie also know as """"The Exorcist"""" is without a doubt the most powerful horror movie ever made."""
923;"When it was released in 1973, ""The Exorcist"" literally shook the world with a very realistic take on the absolutely horrifying subject matter of demonic possession."
924;"Regardless of your position on that issue, the fact that ""The Exorcist"" is one of the elite horror films ever produced is just that, a fact, not an opinion."
925;"Perhaps what is so great about ""The Exorcist"" is that it is so multi."
926;layered, fascinating and literally gut.
927;"wrenching to watch, but more importantly, ""The Exorcist"" is also a great story, a horrifying and haunting story, but a great one."
928;Each of the main characters turns in such powerful performances and the possession of Regan is as realistically portrayed as such a phenomenon could possibly be.
929;His attention to detail in this masterpiece is truly amazing.
930;"there are many reasons why ""The Exorcist"" is such a great piece of film."
931;"One such reason is because it enables the viewer to suspend their disbelief and view the events in ""The Exorcist"" as hauntingly realistic."
932;"In some ways, ""The Exorcist"" is a metaphor for life, a metaphor of good versus evil, right versus wrong, life versus death and sin versus redemption."
933;"in my opinion, ""The Exorcist"" is one of the greatest movies of all."
934;"So many people say, well, you know, ""The Exorcist"" is getting old, I've seen it so many times, it's really funny when you think about it."
935;Maybe to try and laugh is what makes these people feel better after watching this movie.
936;"If I had a dime for every time I heard someone say, ""it really stays with you"", I'd be a rich man."
937;"It is what it is, like it or lump it, because if it's anything, ""The Exorcist"" is a very powerful and thought."
938;"amazingly unique to ""The Exorcist"" is its ability to present fantastic and unbelievable phenomena to the viewer, and make it seem so real, so powerful, and so intense."
939;speaking makes it even more brilliant than taken in the literal sense.
940;"I could go on and on philosophizing about this subject, but the fact of the matter is that ""The Exorcist"" is one of the only horror films that makes one think about the mysteries and the darkness in this life."
941;Across the world, a girl, Regan, played brilliantly by Linda Blair, becomes possessed by an incredibly evil entity, and her loving mother, played exceptionally well by Ellen Burstyn, struggles to provide her daughter with medical care to cure her of her seemingly incurable condition.
942;Another priest, Damien Karras, played exceptionally well by Jason Miller, (got a theme here on the acting) must deal with a terrible tragedy in his life while also struggling with his faith and, ultimately, both priests are called upon to perform an exorcism to save the girl's life, and to do battle with the evil of all evils.
943;"Each of these characters face incredible horror in their lives and all of the subplots come together brilliantly by movie's end to create a masterpiece in ""The Exorcist""."
944;"Exceptional acting is very rare for horror films, and ""The Exorcist"" has some of the best acting that you will ever find in a horror movie or in any movie for that matter."
945;"It all comes together eloquently in ""The Exorcist"" in a frighteningly real and surreal yet beautifully poetic fashion."
946;"This is yet another reason that ""The Exorcist"" is such a great movie."
947;the powerful performances given by each actor in his/her respective role is also a credit to the director, William Friedkin, who went to incredible lengths to make this movie as atmospheric and as realistic as possible, especially given the supernatural and paranormal subject matter involved.
948;"When dealing with the supernatural and the paranormal, one really needs to be able to sell it to the audience, and Friedkin does this exceptionally well in ""The Exorcist""."
949;"So many horror movies fail in this regard, but ""The Exorcist"" does this as well as any movie I have ever seen."
950;In fact, the cinematography of this film is second to none and the effects are brilliant and light years ahead of its time.
951;The production values are obviously top.
952;It is really quite amazing how great this film truly is.
953;It should also be noted that some groups of people, including the Catholics, maintain that possession by demons is a very real phenomenon.
954;"what is so truly amazing about ""The Exorcist"" are the many images that will literally stay with you for the rest of your life."
955;This is one powerful movie that you will never forget, and that makes this movie truly special.
956;The Exorcist is the epitome of what a horror movie should try to be and is the true masterpiece of its genre.
957;"Moreover, the supernatural elements are developed beautifully in ""The Exorcist"" and are done in such a dark and haunting fashion that the viewer is able to experience pure and unadulterated horror while also ascertaining and fully appreciating the evil that has taken hold of Regan."
958;"The haunting score that ""The Exorcist"" employs to compliment its action only works to accentuate the horror that this movie is brilliantly able to produce."
959;"This is yet another reason why ""The Exorcist"" is one of the scariest and best horror movies of all."
960;These are powerful films that make the viewer think about the evil they do not want to know and what they do not understand.
961;"While ""The Exorcist"" is a very dark film, it does leave a sliver of light and hope for humanity that stirs the emotions of the viewer by movie's end, perhaps not the kind of light that makes the average viewer feel comfortable, but it is clearly there."
962;"Once again, this is what makes ""The Exorcist"" such a powerful film, one that is very dear to my heart."
963;"finally, there's been a lot of talk about ""The Exorcist: The version you've never seen"" versus the original and I think both are great."
964;"In order to appreciate the horror genre, ""The Exorcist"", ""The Omen"", Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", and ""Halloween"" are the greatest films that the genre has to offer with the consensus being that ""The Exorcist"" is still the scariest movie of all."
965;After watching this movie yet again, I can certainly understand where the majority is coming from.
966;"Of course, ""The Exorcist"" receives HorrorMan's highest possible rating as one of the greatest and scariest horror movies ever produced and as the most powerful horror movie all."
967;"Simply put, ""The Exorcist"" is cinematic horror in its purest and finest form."
968;Yes I said it The exorcist is the best movie ever not just best horror movie but best movie.
969;This movie is great from begining to the end.
970;Every actor was terrific and that mad the movie even better.
971;this movie is wicked creepy.
972;i loved it, it paved the way for all these other excorsism movies, but this one is definitly the best.
973;the actors were great, the story was so believable, the makeup was good, and it was truly scary.
974;excellent story and brilliant idea.
975;from start to finish this movie was great.
976;The cast for the characters are great, especially Linda Blair, who was around 11 or 12 years old when she played the role of the demon possessed child Reagan.
977;Her acting really excels in this performance, some might think her acting might be too extreme and vulgar for a young girl.
978;That scene is chilling and spooking, thinking how is that possible.
979;overall the success of this movie is the reality of the story.
980;This event is based on actual experiences, written as a novel, and later adapted to the movie.
981;This is the most scariest movie ever and if you have never seen this movie, you have to because it will never go away.
982;Around Halloween every year, we try to find good scary movies to watch.
983;We can always count on The Exorcist to scare us.
984;The performances, the signs of foreboding, the music, the noises, the lighting.
985;everything adds up to just the right ingredients for a movie that is consistently voted in the top three scariest movies of all time over the last 40 years.
986;The Exorcist, the all too familiar tale of a young girl possessed by a demon, still stands, nearly 30 years after its release, as the greatest horror film ever made.
987;Though not nearly as well developed as the original book, the film is still a brilliantly executed battle between the forces of good and evil draped in an atmosphere that simply terrifying.
988;It is to the great work of [director] William Friedkin (the only good film he has ever made, interesting enough) that the films true source of power is that the characters and the situation they find themselves in come across so, well, 'believable'.
989;up FX of Dick Smith are still great and haunting and the cinematography is masterful.
990;Had never seen this version before and truly enjoyed the movie.
991;It kept stopping and I was still charged!
992;I have always loved this movie.
993;I have watched it so many times throughout the years and it still scares me.
994;time fan of Omen, and Shining is one of my favorite films.
995;many movies, like Shining manage to bury under one's skin without so much as special makeup.
996;This movie is a great one to have.
997;the acting is superb and the feeling you get while watching it is disturbing.
998;a great movie throughout though.
999;But ''THE EXORCIST'' is still a real good film.
1000;but make sure you see BAD SEED as well!!
1001;I liked it at first, but now, viewing it older, wiser and a lot more jaded I can't imagine why people took offense to this.
1002;Good detective work there!My main problem with The Exorcist is that it keeps cutting away to side.
1003;i appreciate it from a film.
1004;Well, let me first say that I was born in the 90's so I can't really say anything about the old times, but the movie was still pretty good.
1005;the graphics look nice to be a movie from the 70's.
1006;this is certainly a good movie to watch during the SD thunderstorms snuggled up with your honey.
1007;still the classic, all time, best.
1008;Classic confrontation of good versus evil.
1009;Father Damian Karras is outstanding in his performance.
1010;The Exorcist extended Director's cut is by far one of the best horror movies ever to come out of the horor movie section.
1011;It lives up to the hype of the scariest film of all time and the bonus scenes really added to the movie pace and endurence.
1012;"Two years after winning the Oscar as Best Director for ""The French Connection"", William Friedkin shoots William Peter Blatty's best."
1013;The result is a good movie, one of the scariest ever made, but for me it's a bit overrated.
1014;what's the real use of such plans?The film really starts .
1015;and we can wake up for good .
1016;linda Blair was only 12 when she played in this movie and her performance is amazing.
1017;up work on her of course played a great role in her performance but she really did great.
1018;I've never seen such a young actress acting that good, playing an evil character with such conviction and realism.
1019;We also can see Ellen Burstyn in her best.
1020;awarded' and Mike Oldfield's music are great, really fitting the rottening atmosphere.
1021;It is a good, classic film!
1022;Worth seeing if you never have for the classic nature on its own.
1023;Pretty great effects for the time it was created!
1024;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
1025;What I like about the movie is that in this movie you better brace yourself as one of the all.
1026;The result is an experience more gripping than ever.
1027;Now seen are moments deepening the impact of the performances by Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb.
1028;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
1029;I would recommend this movie to other people.
1030;her mother, a successful actress, divorced and on her own has to face the very real possibility that something very sinister is happening.
1031;in the woman's heart she knows her daugther has done this and begs the priest for the exorcism.
1032;That's the really new element, and even so, there had been some antecedents.
1033;moslem bias and it is absolutely unacceptable.
1034;Apart from that the film was well made and still is well made.
1035;The suspense and the progression of the plot are quite clear.
1036;That's why I will classify this film among the films that played an important role when they came out and even accumulated some fame because of it, but that have today aged tremendously and lost most of their appeal.
1037;"I'll admit, I'm a fan of ""slice 'em and dice 'em"" flicks, but even I thought this movie made the hairs on the back of my head stand on end!!"
1038;Some people that I have talked to weren't to impressed with the slow begining, but I found that it added so much to the film.
1039;The acting was excellent, the story line is an A++, and the special effects were haunting (who knew that a whole room had to be refridgerated an entire night so that they could achieve those special effects!!!
1040;This is a great movie for any Horror Fan.
1041;Thank for the great service!
1042;I must admit, I never have enough courage to watch this movie frequently, but when I do I see a movie that is a masterpiece even by today's standards.
1043;The new scenes the film company added on to here are amazing, such as the one where Reagan descends the stairs like a spider with blood dripping out her mouth, simply horrifying I'm telling you.
1044;But the reason for this, is that you will understand the film a little better.
1045;If your the type of person that enjoys getting spooked by movies such as these, I personally recommend you take the chance by picking up this movie.
1046;But this movie is good, even though some scenes are quite disturbing.
1047;Now if that's your cup of tea, you'll love this movie.
1048;Great performances, excellent atmosphere, and technically proficient, but very sickening.
1049;A good, strong story the Exorcist is about a young girl who becomes possessed by a demon (or something!)
1050;rate and makes the characters feel real where many movies like this would have made them 2.
1051;I find this movie to be one of the defining films of the horror genera.
1052;One of the best man!
1053;It is incredibly scary but at the same time deeply religious and philosophical.
1054;This is one of the best films of all time.
1055;This movie was winner of 2 academy awards and nominated for 6 in total.
1056;This movie acutally has a point and when you understand whats going on you realize how great of film it is.
1057;This is one of the greatest stories to a movie ive ever seen.
1058;It is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.
1059;Saw this film for the first time here in New York city on the big screen.
1060;bggest comedy of the year!
1061;Don't worry, just take your pills and you'll be fine!!
1062;Linda Blair as always gives a great performance .
1063;Still as potent today as when I watched it in a theater in 1973.
1064;very doubtful they could make this film today as it is, and get an R rating.
1065;ray looks and sounds great!
1066;There is grain in the film, but that is more to how it was filmed and it's age, than anything technological of today.
1067;Behind the Scenes, including the real.
1068;life story of the teenage boy who was possessed.
1069;up again in the comedy spoofRepossessed(1990).
1070;"He wants to do an ""Exorcist"" tv."
1071;this movie still make the hair stands the hair on the back of my neck stand up .
1072;Everything from the Actors to the below the line production (sound, visual effects, music, cinematography) this classic horror picture still stands as an important piece of what great storytelling, pacing and direction can do for a film!
1073;He frees a young girl possessed by a demon.
1074;He acted as if the incident were factual.
1075;I wonder how Linda Blair has managed to live with it.
1076;I recommend this to anyone and everyone who is in for a good thrill!
1077;This is the most frightening movie ever!
1078;But in the middle and end, it got really good.
1079;And everyone gets freaked out.
1080;I want to make clear that I love 'The Exorcist' it is a great film and is truly disturbing.
1081;probably my favorite movie and a very beautiful story, believe it or not.
1082;"Although ""The Exorcist"" came out in 1973 and although in the years since then I have seen many many horror films ""The Exorcist"" still remains to this day I feel the scariest movie of all times."
1083;The story line is very powerful with scenes and imagery that remains with the viewer long after the film has ended.
1084;The movie was certainly intended to shock and awe the audience.
1085;"That is how powerful an effect ""The Exorcist"" had on the movie viewers."
1086;"Because of its powerful theme ""The Exorcist"" has become such a film legend that pretty much anyone who has never seen the movie or was even born when the movie came out are still familier with the plot and some of the more memorable scenes."
1087;Even for those who didn't believe in an afterlife or of a force of ultimate good vs a force of ultimate evil still caused them to stop and reflect on the possibilities.
1088;Good verses evil has from the beginning of movie making been one of the most common themes pitting both sides to the ultimate battle.
1089;Watch this movie just once and it will stay with you forever that is how powerful the movie is.
1090;But the fact is it is such a well made film I find I never tire of watching it and have seen it numerious times over the years.
1091;Beautifully directed by William Friedkin to wring out every drop of tension and wonderfully acted with a cast including Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J Cobb and Max Von Sydow in the title roll.
1092;If you have never seen this movie then I do recommend this but be prepared.
1093;This will be I am sure the most intense movie you will ever see.
1094;I recommend this movie regardless of what your religious convictions may be or lack of it.
1095;What I got was something psychologically penetrating and ultimately far more haunting than any other film in recent memory.
1096;The extra footage is a nice touch, though none of it truly changes the plot in any signifcant manner.
1097;The acting in this film is ok, Linda Blair does an amazing job for a 12 year old in her first major role but the other acting isn't the greatest.
1098;Try checking out Zombie, Cannibal Holocaust, The Beyond, New York Ripper, Hellrasier, Hellbound Hellrasier 2, Dawn of the Dead.
1099;the Exorcist is a decent movie but in noway one of the greatest horror films of all time.
1100;My friend (with the horror anxiety) and I watched it to much delight (and hand holding).
1101;This film is still gripping today as it was 26 years ago.
1102;Great story, performances and directing.
1103;As far as the genre of horror goes, this is a cornerstone and landmark film.
1104;Movie received quickly, well wrapped and was in great condition.
1105;This to me is the all time greatest horror story produced.
1106;Still sends chills as it did when it opened.
1107;I usually watch it with the lights on.
1108;This is one of my all time favorite horror movies.
1109;I know for some people this is not an easy movie to watch but this is one of my favorites.
1110;hence this movie has a great charge of realism.
1111;and the book itself is a great literature piece.
1112;the acting is supremely good, and aside the green puke, the especial effects used on Linda Blair are creepy enough to still scare you 30 years after this movie was shot.
1113;the extra scenes are equally as scary.
1114;a great horror classic that will never stop horrofying us.
1115;It still scares me when I watch it, which I have seen many of times.
1116;It is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and still enjoy it.
1117;if you haven't you have gotta get it, if you have seen it you still gotta get it.
1118;I would recmmend this one for sure!
1119;This one about Reagan being possesed is great and the special effects are great as well as everything else about this movie is something else to see.
1120;So if you want to see something spooky, See this one.
1121;Sharpness and detail are pretty good for a film that's now 30 years old.
1122;This is certainly the best The Exorcist has ever looked.
1123;Colors are very good for a 30 year old film.
1124;The mix on The Version You've Never Seen is absolutely astonishing for a 30 year old film.
1125;This is very entertaining and informative.
1126;Next up is the excellent 75 minute documentary The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist.
1127;This is really a great documentary, and is one of the best I've ever seen.
1128;25th anniv: (5/5) Version You've: (3/5)Movie:The Exorcist is an excellent film.
1129;I'm a Christian, and I think that this is a very important film that has a deep and powerful message.
1130;I believe that this is an excellent, thought provoking film, and should be seen by every one, especially Catholics and Christians who have open minds.
1131;The extended dialog between Karras and Merrin is well done, and probably should have been there in the first place.
1132;Whichever way you choose to watch the film, it's still a masterpice, and the scariest film of all time.
1133;Just as good as when i watched at the movies.
1134;Always thought this was a scary movie.
1135;I think this one is the best.
1136;the added dialogue scenes are also essential.
1137;When one watches the original, one can't help but get the impression that Freidkin celebrates the triumph of evil over good.
1138;Father Karris's journey from doubt to sacrifice in the film is breathtaking.
1139;turning scene was revolutionary, and the crucifix, Let Jesus.
1140;But for me, the true beauty of the film is Father Karris and the victory of good over evil.
1141;Possibly the only film ever made that terrifies you and moves you, all at once.
1142;A superb soundtrack, Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for a start, and a very powerful performance from the young Linda Blair as the demon.
1143;possessed Regan, and set of petrifying sequences.
1144;"It is important to understand that there were many ""firsts"" for the horror genre in this film."
1145;The film was first released in theaters in 1973 and was nominated for 10 Oscars, including best film.
1146;It was, at the time, one of the highest grossing films of all times.
1147;Just as Dan Brown made the DaVinci Code seem real thru the use of actual facts and set locations, the story of the Exorcist seemed very real thru the use of specific and detailed references to Catholic traditions and medical treatments.
1148;The special effects, at that time, were actually special.
1149;To appreciate this film today, it is helpful to understand the historical context.
1150;have fun reading all the lore about the movie!
1151;but i have to say is was a good movie .
1152;Even though it did scare me I love it and I watch it when ever I get a chance!
1153;Nothing compares to this movie!
1154;I love horror films but I haven't liked any horror movies as much as this one!
1155;"One of the best ""follow the novel"" movies made."
1156;It is finely acted, and much like possessions are described.
1157;First of all i wont go into great detail about this movie as so many other reviewers have.
1158;and the spiderwalk scene is very wild.
1159;i have seen this many times and it is one of my favorite horror movies.
1160;Linda Blair and Ellen Burtsyn both should have won academy awards for this.
1161;the exorcist is a well made movie.
1162;it is also one of the most terrifying movies i have ever seen.
1163;also based on a true story, so that makes it even scarier.
1164;"My Wife and Son and I were treated to an interesting experience during the movie
1165;I very much enjoyed the directors commentary.
1166;And as always the widescreen/letterbox format is always the preferable way to view a movie.
1167;One of a few movies in Hollywood that comes in mind in terms of having every elements for a movie from horror,humor,suspense,mystery,e. t. c. i will always think of the """"Exorcist""""."""
1168;It's a very intelligent, thought.
1169;But for those that dare to understand the meanings in this film, the reality of it all leaves you shaken to the very core.
1170;Something that knows past, present and future?
1171;Something that is inside of you yet outside of you?
1172;Something that is part of you yet apart from you?
1173;The spirit is powerful, yes, but he does have his weaknesses but not in any human sense.
1174;He knows this and he seeks to make us despair about our humanity.
1175;In the end, we are sure of only two things and these two things we can never prove in any human capacity: Our faith in Jesus to love and forgive us for our sins and the gift that he gave us apart from his everlasting love: free will.
1176;She is fighting it barely.
1177;Knowing the biological tree of life: humans.
1178;He goes in to much detail about the stages of demonic posession and he explains wonderfully the very real relationship between Jesus, Lucifer and Humans.
1179;This is truly the scariest movie of all time and for good reasons.
1180;The film is pretty accurate in portraying certain aspects of posession although it has taken some creative liberties.
1181;It's a very real dilemma.
1182;But for those that do, it speaks directly to the faith and spirit of Man.
1183;Even if you don't think about this movie in any intellectual, spiritual or philosophical way, it still scares that heck out of you and keeps you awake for nights.
1184;Both procedures are usually performed with local anesthesia, but also occasionally light sedation or general anesthesia.
1185;A suspension of disbelief is required for the rational person to enjoy this movie.
1186;The Exorcist was amazing even without the deleted scenes.
1187;But if it's one of your favorites, the director's cut is a must see.
1188;each actor becomes the characters of the story making the film that more believable.
1189;The music is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.
1190;She floats off of her bed and her head turns around three hundred and sixty degress.
1191;Max Von Sydow plays his role of Father Merrin so well that we actually believe that he is a priest.
1192;This is better than the original, infinitely better, and I don't say that lightly.
1193;"It transforms that classic 1973 shockfest/bleak tale of an innocent young girl defiled by forces beyond science and beyond the most extreme of human assistance into a subtle masterpiece which transcends horror and most so called ""religious"" films in general."
1194;The face that appears momentarily speaks for itself.
1195;One of the best horror movies ever made and thought provoking about the most important questions in our lives.
1196;The picture is beautiful, and the sound is awesome.
1197;Besides the brilliant movie itself, the extras go above and beyond with this set.
1198;TWO commentary tracks (one by the director, and one by the author/screenwriter), interviews, The Making Of which is very insightful, storyboards,.
1199;there is so much it takes both sides of the disc!
1200;"You will get many hours of enjoyment from this
1201;to whom much of the film's success is owned.
1202;worked in more than 100 films both in Mexico and abroad up until 2004, less than a year before his untimely death, and `The Exorcist' is just one more example of his brilliant talents as an artist (in fact, sound effects are known in the Mexican trade as """"Gaviras"""", in honor of his creativity)."""
1203;That movie is truly frightening.
1204;Williams Friedkin's masterpiece is timeless and holds up quite well with time.
1205;Seen it 8 times over the years and it still has quite a effect on me.
1206;"The packaging is wonderful with it's hardcover ""keepsake"" aesthetic, and the additional bonus features alone make it worth the meager asking price."
1207;Seeing actual footage of Linda Blair (in full makeup no less) on the set is priceless and definitely trumps any extras from the previous releases.
1208;on to the important stuff.
1209;i have to say that this has become my favorite film of all time.
1210;It is a modern parable and is one of those rare films that truly produces it's intended effect in every frame.
1211;It's a spiritual drama, psychological thriller, and supernatural tale.
1212;all rolled into one.37 years later, it still holds it's own and is as relevant today as it was then.
1213;the fear and trepidation involved in all things metaphysical and spiritual.
1214;It's about the mystery of faith and it's capacity to ultimately triumph.
1215;It's incredibly well written by Blatty.
1216;like realism serves the plot well.
1217;The acting is top notch by a cast that could not have been more perfect.
1218;i was fortunate enough to see the Fathom screening on Sept. 30th and, while seeing this film on a big screen with digital sound was fantastic, I still have to say it plays better and provides more unnerving sensations when watching at home.
1219;That is the truly frightening angle within this film.
1220;The movie is very good.
1221;time favorite movie memories started with waiting in line to see THE EXORCIST while folks in surrounding office buildings yelled encouragement out of their windows.
1222;ray edition is the best copy I've seen, and I loved the booklet as well.
1223;It was interesting to see the Director's Cut which adds approximately 15 minutes to the original.
1224;"It's nice to have, and the extras are great
1225;What a great movie this is.
1226;This little gem of a movie .
1227;gave me and my family lots of warm memories.
1228;The audience reaction at this film was amusing.
1229;One of the best horror movies of all time!
1230;I stayed because I love horror movies.
1231;Not much on slasher films but love the suspenseful, scary ones.
1232;my main reasoning behind the success of this movie is simple.
1233;all aspects of the movie were excellent.
1234;every time that I watch it, it affects me.
1235;I'm 52 years old now and it still gets to me.
1236;turn out the lights, turn the volume up and enjoy, if you dare.
1237;The acting is phenomenal, very believable performances for a supernatural film.
1238;This film clearly started a whole new style of film making.
1239;All you will feel is utter dread, completely and in the most certain of ways.
1240;we see a gentle child, a girl no less, being possessed by sheer evil.
1241;even if you are a good Christian.
1242;proceed with extreme caution, this film will provoke you to dread and make you question your faith and your own view on the spiritual world.
1243;I avoided seeing this moview for years.
1244;It treats it in a """"real"""" manner."""
1245;The realism with which this is portrayed is one of the things that makes this movie so potentially frightening.
1246;There is, however, some good news that this movie brings out.
1247;It can be fought successfully.
1248;It disrupts what is good.
1249;another powerful lesson is that we as humans are given the authority to combat evil.
1250;It does and this movie is a masterpiece that depicts that fact.
1251;The 2010 transfer of both versions is excellent without jitter and containing superb detail with equally excellent restoration to eliminate any significant print damage.
1252;"Sounds very good with things still well centered on the ""center"" channel
1253;level and higher home 5.1 systems will deliver better audio with finer details to be heard than anyone ever experienced in any theater in 1973.
1254;Completely deserving of its R rating by the MPAA due to extremely strong language, a very disturbing scene with sexual content involving the girl (while possessed), and graphically violent death scenes.
1255;Blatty, the novel and screenplay author, was extremely upset with Friedkin for many years over this, in spite of the film's immense success and continued popularity.
1256;The ten Academy nominations including Best Picture, and seven Golden Globe nominations it received . . . unheard of for a horror film including being the first one nominated for an Academy Best Picture . . . should be telling.
1257;It still ranks as one of the """"scariest"""" films ever made."""
1258;from start to finishit is filled with heart stopping suspense and terror.
1259;the acting is superb and the storyline was groundbreakingfor this genre.
1260;the fact that the Exorcist did not win the Oscarfor best picture is somewhat puzzling.
1261;i give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like the atmosphere of the movie which is about all that it has going for it.
1262;The Exorcist is an entertaining, interesting movie, but not scary.
1263;The special effects aren't as sophisticated as today's CGI but the film still packs a wallop due to the clever editing.
1264;You're on an emotional roller coaster ride while the suspense ebbs and flows as the story gradually builds with each possession scene of increasing intensity until the final confrontation between good and evil.
1265;ray version still has too much grain but the overall picture is better.
1266;ray coming out in October '13 so I'll wait to see if the grain situation has improved.
1267;Meanwhile I'll keep this one and wait for the reviews.
1268;Director Friedkin's masterful adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best.
1269;Look for a solid late.
1270;this is still strong stuff.
1271;Still one of the scariest movies ever made.
1272;I highly recommend this movie
1273;from beginning to end this movie will keep you on the edge.
1274;It really makes you think about what is going on.
1275;That was a wild scene to say the least.
1276;Ellen Bursten and Linda Blair are amazing in their parts.
1277;William Peter Blatty created a real gem with this masterpiece.
1278;If you enjoyed this movie, also check out The Omen movies, which were also great ones.
1279;"I could do without the newly added ""nervous disorder"" scene in the hospital, but the ""spiderwalk"" scene is chilling, and should have been in the original cut."
1280;A wonderful directed, edited, scored, acted film.
1281;The best horror film ever.
1282;Damn, do I love movies.
1283;I have seen the Exorcist many times and I am surprised at how it still sends a chill down my spine.
1284;what makes viewing this movie in a theater such a treat is the clarity of the picture.
1285;this movie is still shocking, still frightening, and still a helluva lot of fun.
1286;this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made.
1287;Love the fact it comes with both director's cut and theatrical release.
1288;Nice behind the scenes extras as well.
1289;Consider for a moment the intrinsic shock value of thispicture.
1290;I first saw this movie when I was 16 and found the beginning of it absolutely terrifying.
1291;Special effects are great and the true feel of the demon Pazuzu does come through.
1292;Still, one must understand that this movie's overall appearance does borderline the documentary.
1293;Fairly good stuff all in all.
1294;An old movie that I have seen many times.
1295;I liked its musical background.
1296;This movie revolted, facsinated, and flat out scared the hell out of them, and most of them loved it!
1297;What a movie, and a stroke of brilliant filmmaking, to get an audience to behave as such.
1298;There are many subtle scenes that may escape those who only want to see head spinning and green pea soup.
1299;Regan eventually transforms into one of the most terrifying monsters in cinematic history.
1300;linda blair played the most famous and most realistic child endangered by demonic forces.
1301;a battle between good and evil at it's very best.
1302;Read the other 800+ reviews for a more thorough analysis of this classic movie and its plot, etc.
1303;A demonically possessed 12 year old girl who demonstrates increasingly bizarre, twisted behavior certainly is scary, but I find humor in a lot of her comments and scenes in general.
1304;I find her filthy language humorous.
1305;One positive to the movie is the fact that it's fall and it's late October (one scene shows some kids running along the sidewalk dressed in their Halloween costumes with the Tubular Bells song playing).
1306;A great musical score can make a movie scarier than it normally would be without the music.
1307;It can make all the difference in the world.
1308;A lot of nighttime footage, both indoors and outdoors.
1309;But it got buried as a result of The Exorcist's popularity.
1310;It does have its moments, though.
1311;I laughed out loud when seeing this because it shows the mentality of people.
1312;She's acting in a movie.
1313;She's in heavy makeup, basically a costume.
1314;do I recommend this movie?
1315;It's a horror classic with a memorable theme song.
1316;It's a brilliant mix of horror and religion.
1317;This movie is a classic, well made, good cinematography, has a memorable theme song, and has good acting.
1318;These two things average out to 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5, so it's a 5 star movie.
1319;This is a great movie it kinda reminds me of The Shining which whenI searched this title out it said to me that this movie was suggested for me since I like The Shining.
1320;Overall I think thismovie is great.
1321;The Exorcist is truly a scary movie, even almost 30 years after its release.
1322;It had just the right amount of special effects to comprise some truly gory scenes.
1323;An excellent cast and crew featuring Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair and Max von Sydow made the movie quite engaging.
1324;in another sense, The Exorcist is truly the scariest of them all.
1325;done movie I have seen!
1326;If you are scared of horror movies, then I recommend you NOT watch this, but if they don't bother you and you love them, then The Exorcist is the perfect movie for you!
1327;This film is pretty good I recieved it in just one week.
1328;i watched it as soon as I got it.
1329;this film is very good and it is very scary,this film makes you think if these types of things happened to you.
1330;great film must watch blu ray
1331;The movie is a classic.
1332;All movies keep stopping and you end up waiting for for it to load.
1333;Everybody talks about how it makes you THINK!
1334;It's a good flick, in its day it was a great one.
1335;The Exorcist had some class.
1336;As a Christian drama about demonic possession it's nearly a masterpiece, but like my pastor said, you can take a 76 Chevy, paint it, and it'll still be a 76 Chevy.
1337;But still I liked it as a Christian drama.
1338;The Evil One is capable of using such a fascination as a means to ensnare us .
1339;We can be absolutely assured that only God is All Powerful, and He is absolutely victorious over the devil!
1340;In surrendering to God, who loves each and every one of us limitlessly, we find absolute fulfillment and untold happiness.
1341;this movie is one of my favorite movie of all time.
1342;it looks fantastic on blu ray i recommend it.
1343;One of the first horror films i ever saw and it's still great today.
1344;I guess it is a bit slow by today's standards, but I think it's still very effective.
1345;ray master is very well done.
1346;The Exorcist has justifiably been called one of the scariest movies ever made, and it is a testament to its enduring power that a rerelease twenty.
1347;this film is directed perfectly by William Friedken from an Oscar.
1348;winning screenplay by William Peter Blatty.
1349;Friedkin makes the movie visually haunting, and creates many scenes of exceptional power that still have the power to disturb.
1350;The performances in this movie are some of the most intense that I have ever seen.
1351;deserved Oscar nominations for their labor.
1352;"On the whole, though, I highly recommend ""The Exorcist."""
1353;It deserves its high reputation.
1354;I just saw The Exorcist for the first time last night and I loved it.
1355;This is a classic Horror movie with all of the right elements.
1356;This movie shines in the character development of all the major players.
1357;This movie is best viewed in the dark around mid.
1358;Great special effects for time period made.
1359;Love paranormal movies and this one does it very well.
1360;One of the best thriller, horror and suspense series.
1361;Classic but still the best so far!
1362;a tour of the iconic locations where the film was shot (Blu.
1363;A good, scary film about demonic possession.
1364;This is a horror drama with realistic charactors portrayed by wonderful actors.
1365;The story builds and takes its time, so don't expect some cheap.
1366;The original cut was best but this is still a great film.
1367;"If the ultimate question in our life is, ""is there life after death"" and since this movie is based on actual cases of possessions of evil spirits then if you believe then this is a very important movie and answers that question."
1368;Yes at times its dated and a visual assault but is so intelligent, well made with excellent acting, shocking and highly religious.
1369;But I really enjoyed watching it with adult guests.
1370;Wanted to see the modern redo.
1371;Has always been one of the best horror movies of all time!
1372;Be sure you dont ever watch it alone
1373;As a huge fan of the movie I found this box set to very informative!
1374;The documentary The fear of God goes into the background of the story and the making of the movie.
1375;The posession scenes are brilliance in filmmaking.
1376;An excellent movie, and a pioneer in scary films.
1377;this movie is awesome .
1378;The Exorcist has to be one of the scariest movies ever made.
1379;This elevates the surprise factor and makes the whole experience nerve.
1380;It is nothing short of genius and it is absolutely bone.
1381;chilling (what black and red make.
1382;A perfect illustration of evil.
1383;The spider walk is scary and is a good addition.
1384;This is a timeless horror movie.
1385;Lots of things to notice even after viewing it in the past.
1386;This sense of discombobulation is quite effective, more so than the rather silly second half of the movie.
1387;Linda Blair, utterly without talent, is hidden behind some (admittedly) great make.
1388;feeling first half of the movie is worth seeing again and again.
1389;In any event, the mark this film has made on popular culture has been enormous .
1390;The rewards are uneven, but it's still worth checking out.
1391;"[By the way, the extra footage was fine
1392;That's all I have to say about that.
1393;standing legend as one of the best horror films ever made.
1394;The movie is one of the best adaptations of a novel that I've seen.
1395;Though there weren't many scenes added to this version of the movie it is fantastic because of the remastered sound.
1396;The Dolby 5.1 digital sound is so good you really hear chilling effects from all directions.
1397;I really enjoyed this new version.
1398;If you are an adult longing to be scared again like you were when you were a kid, this is your movie!
1399;A great film that packs a scare like no other!
1400;This is how should all movies special editions look like.
1401;This has to be one of the most frightening films ever made, and the added scenes only made it scarier.
1402;see for anyone, whether you're a long.
1403;Other than that, it's an excellent film.
1404;step with the movie, but I thought it was chilling.
1405;This movie is the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life.
1406;If you like scary, this gives a whole new meaning to the word.
1407;later, I appreciate its importance in film history and in our culture.
1408;It's also just a good story.
1409;I especially like the conflict within the doubting priest and how he stays true to his calling in the end.
1410;It is good to go back and see something that you saw a long time ago.
1411;Seeing this again made me realize that a good scare is always a good scare.
1412;I would recommend watching it again.
1413;I am a movie connoisseur and I love THE EXORCIST.
1414;The main reason the movie scared me is because I am a deeply religious person and I know that that is possible.
1415;Reguardless of what people say, it's possible and it touched a sore spot in my psyche.
1416;Nowadays it's all about blood and guts and don't get me wrong, I love a good blood.
1417;It was a delight and true onor to watch them both on screen.
1418;USA Today nominated this movie the scariest ever made, and I have to agree with them!
1419;If you like The Exorcist, please check out my blog post!
1420;Fun insight onto this classic horror movie.
1421;In 1973 William Friedkin created a screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel The Exorcist.
1422;The film earned ten Oscar nominations.
1423;the way in which The Exorcist presents its characters and allows each of them to develop in this horrifying predicament is what sets the stage for the horror to seem so genuine.
1424;It is their duty and they are the film's heroes.
1425;Merrin makes it clear to Karras that the demon is a masterful liar and that they must not listen to him no matter what.
1426;It is almost as powerful and horrifying as the earlier stages of the film where we see the gradual manifestation of evil in young Reagan.
1427;the shift from normal little girl to full blown demon in the Exorcist contains, at least within the context of this compelling drama, the scariest images ever portrayed on film.
1428;Part of that is nostalgia but it is an incredibly compelling movie as well.
1429;You should enjoy the excitement and hold your arms up in a roller.
1430;set to enjoy a film like the Exorcist should be similar.
1431;That is what makes the experience an unforgettable one.
1432;There are so few horror films that can do that but the Exorcist delivers every single time.
1433;That is what makes it so exceptional.
1434;Could definitely see where other movies got ideas.
1435;back then with no cji fake affects so forth this movie is the one to learn from u can without all that CJI animation make a great and scary film.
1436;This is a classic film with incredible special effects for its day, excellent acting, editing, production design, cinematography and sound design.
1437;mastered version as I remembered how all these elements created such an incredible story and disturbing experience.
1438;their guilt and humanity are elements that tie into this story so well and make you feel that a normal young girl could have this experience.
1439;I don't know but my favorite films are from the 70s .
1440;i recommend watching with someone else not on your own if you have a good imagination!
1441;I have that version, and, even though it's interesting (especially with the creepy demon face that flashes every so often, which is really cool) I'm looking for the first cut that came out in the theater in 1973.
1442;the original cut is very special to me in many ways.
1443;Boy, did I see an eyeful!
1444;But we did see those films together back then as well.
1445;It's what Friedkin does best.
1446;I'd rather watch Al Pacino question his sexuality over a 'feel good' musical any day.
1447;And being an only child, in my own little world, without any siblings to set me strait, only made these fantastic thoughts more stronger and believable.
1448;To those that pointed me in the right direction, thank you.
1449;What makes this movie so terrifying is that it's a true story.
1450;Some scenes are added for shock factor and suspense.
1451;The movie is definitely scarier and more powerful than the 1973 release.
1452;I was surprised when Warner Bros. actually re.
1453;If you have never seen this movie, it will probably scare you.
1454;I have always loved The Exorcist.
1455;he then knows that he must confront a great evil.
1456;but,hey,anything's possible.You'll love this chiller/thriller/horror/suspense flick that I call sensational.
1457;I also have an excellent book on the making of the film.
1458;Amityville was great, but let's face it.
1459;The Exorcist was so well written, expertly researched (based on a true story), and brilliantly directed.
1460;She never matured into a great actress, but what a job she did in this film, and she was only 14!
1461;The movie was so well cast.
1462;It doesn't scare me any more due to the hundreds of times I've seen it, but I still revisit it because it is an achievement beyond any other film.
1463;The job these guys did with what they had is beyond words.
1464;The mind games that the demon plays with Father Karras, while Karras is trying to prove genuine possession are riveting.
1465;I highly recommend the original novel.
1466;I also recommend the book on the actual TRUE case this story is based on.
1467;You'll see things in great detail for the first time.
1468;ray comes with both the original version and the updated 2000 version with added scenes, and a booklet.
1469;fans of the film are welcome to e. mail me at NolanKevin7@aol.
1470;It's clarity is far superior to VHS tapes.
1471;Many of the film's shocks still hold up well today, thanks to Linda Blair's unnerving performance of 12.
1472;This movie will make my mother laugh for sure when she opens it this Christmas.
1473;I know this is a classic, so my fiance and o decided to watch it on date night.
1474;Ok to start off, this movie was good.
1475;The movie was good, especially being made quite a long time ago.
1476;It's a classic to see!
1477;I don't find it very scary, but it is very suspenseful (to me at least).
1478;It truly stands as the scariest movie of all time, and is also the best movie of all time.
1479;Bravo to performances by Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Kitty Winn, and a cast of others.
1480;And a wonderfully demonic voice done by Mercedes McCambridge.
1481;This is the scariest flick ever made PERIOD!!!!
1482;Friedkin's scare flick still has legs.
1483;but other than that, the film works.
1484;et al. make for a solid cast.
1485;i think William Friedkin is one of the finest directors around, if not the best, when it comes to creating atmosphere and using extras.
1486;Furthermore, one of two (yes two not three ) trailers is actually a trailer from the 1978/79 rerelease!
1487;Originally, this face contorted and showed the gastly vision for quite a few moments.
1488;anyway, watching this as a regular movie is fine.
1489;The documentary was excellent, and I finally got to see the notorious spider.
1490;I think it was a great idea to re.
1491;master the sound, as the sound is one of the most frightening aspects of the movie.
1492;It rightly deserved the 1973 Academy Award for best sound.
1493;( if you are easily shocked I would seriously recommend either fast.
1494;liked by most of the actors who have worked with him, and you will find out they have good cause for this.
1495;But I have to admit, he got results, and this is one HELL of a great movie.
1496;I am pleased with the movie and will watch it again and again.
1497;Thanks to Amazon you can bring back vivid memories of when this one was in theatres frightening all who saw it.
1498;This is a scary,bloody,freaky amazing film.
1499;I love it this is so amazing it ranks on the same list as The Usual Suspects which is obviously the best film ever made.
1500;It's so great an amazing film.
1501;Great movie to watch although it was made in the 70's.
1502;This still has to be one of the best all time horror flix.
1503;The Exorcist is a classic scary movie in my opinion.
1504;The Exorcist is a timeless masterpiece that never gets old.
1505;For a movie that was in 1973, Picture and Sound was good.
1506;This movie is the best horror movie ever made.
1507;Once you have seen it, you will have to see it again.
1508;The whole R rating is a must view.
1509;I watch this at least once a momnth.
1510;when my kids are old enough I will share the hauntings with them.
1511;It is still as good as the first time I saw it.
1512;Ive seen the entire Exorcist series and in my opinion, the first one is the best.
1513;Any true fan of The Exorcist should have this in their collection.
1514;The Special Features are good, this is one of the few movies that Ive actually watched features for.
1515;I loved seeing the Behind the Scenes footage with Linda Blair, also, the interviews with the cast, director and writer are well done.
1516;overall: Im so glad they finally put everything altogether in one great collectors edition!
1517;The scene: a fifteen year old boy walks into his local retail store and sees The Exorcist.
1518;this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.
1519;The plot is amazing and the acting is just as amazing.
1520;William Friedkin did a really good job, better then he did with French Connection (that's still a good movie, but this ones better).
1521;really, really scary and good!
1522;Every time i sit down to wacht this movies it gives me the creeps,I really enjoyed this version.
1523;Even though the director put back in some of the missing """"carpentry"""" (as Blatty refers to) in the """"Version You've Never Seen"""", there are still a great deal of unexplained questions."""
1524;Therefore, we end up with a movie that is entirely humanist, but no less fascinating (and superbly entertaining, in my opinion, at least).
1525;Every extra that any sane person could wish for is here, and the picture and sound are superlative.
1526;shakingly good effects, sound design, etc.
1527;I was fortunate enough to see the 2000 extended cut at a local theater a couple of years back on Halloween night, and the experience of watching a good classic movie like this one is always more rewarding than watching these simplistic newer movies that we have nowadays.
1528;I enjoy the expanded cut more so because to me it is, in a sense, the most complete version (despite some silly effects shots that really shouldn't have been added).
1529;This movie is deservedly a classic, but to me it's one of the great comedies of all time.
1530;There are films I find really scary, most of which my wife is too afraid to watch (Hitchcock's Psycho, Jaws, Halloween, Alien), but The Exorcist always makes me laugh.
1531;In retrospect, this has to be considered one of the top 25 American films of the second half of the 20th century.
1532;The reason I am citing here in particular is the overt and powerful emphasis on the external.
1533;Let's see what that means.
1534;"american culture has always had a practical, ""can do"" orientation."
1535;a perspective that has consistently (at least since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, if not before) emphasized the accomplishment of goals through work.
1536;It's a potent drama that slams the viewer in the face with just how embedded we are in this Protestant/Judeo.
1537;the Exorcist succeeds both in scaring us because of its relentless insistence on the external vs. the internal, and in providing a cinematic work that does not rely primarily on jolts (though it certainly does have its share of those), but on the emotional depths to which those affected by this extreme of external influence can sink.
1538;who gives a powerhouse performance.
1539;is, in fact, the real star of the show, running the gamut of eomtions from exuberance to complete despair.
1540;max von Sydow and Jason Miller as the priests are also great, and in an uncharacteristic role.
1541;a remarkable piece of work that is still fresh in 2005, The Exorcist is a film to add to any collection of best American cinema in the last 50 years.
1542;, it is an incredible film, sure to put the fear of God in you!
1543;this has to be one of the scariest movies of all time, but one of the best I have ever seen in the horror genre.
1544;the main suggestion that I want to make is that you do NOT watch this movie alone!
1545;This film is by far the most scariest of all time.
1546;even though i loved the dreaded sequel this is by far something that seems so real its true.
1547;In fact this movie is based on true life something like this happened.
1548;A Classic all the way and remains one of the greatest horror films ever made.
1549;That's why I recommend this version: it has new remastered sound and images, but it doesn't add any new fancy shots, leaving you the experience perfect as it was.
1550;"in the words of its director, William Friedkin, ""The Exorcist"" is so scary because it looks very real."
1551;He definitely hit the jackpot with William P. Blatty's awesome screenplay, as well as great performances by Jason Miller and Linda Blair (whose acting career never recovered from this role).
1552;if you're a fan of this movie, this edition is THE ONE for you.
1553;If you are one of the few that never saw it (personally, I wasn't even born when it was released), then this should be a good opportunity for you to view a classic in the horror genre.
1554;Took another look at this classic movie and still thought it was well made.
1555;The movie deals with the ancient subject of exorcism and should be viewed by adults or young adults who have done their research.
1556;Remember this movie is based on a true story.
1557;The Exorcist is a masterpiece!
1558;I particularly enjoyed the BBC documentary on the making of the film, which is featured on this 25th anniversary edition.
1559;In addition, director William Friedkin offers an impassioned commentary, revealing the vision and spirit of a true artist.
1560;Years later, I finally got a chance to watch famous horror The Exorcist (1973).
1561;the movie is perfect in every aspect.
1562;Creepy music score, good plot development, eerie atmosphere, interesting characters, not to mention special effects, which for its time are very appealing.
1563;the movie deals with a young girl who gets possessed by Satan, and her actress mother who tries everything to help her daughterfree.
1564;The young actress who was only 14 years old when she played the possessed girl did a remarkable job at portraying one crazy f. b. she should have been awarded with an Oscar for that performance.
1565;I have seen this movie numerous times.
1566;This is an excellent horror movie in every sense of the word.
1567;The 25th Anniversary Edition was especially excellent due to the fact that there was a documentary on the making of the film.
1568;One to watch for a good scare every now and again!
1569;If you have never seen this before, the opening seems an odd place for the movie but it sets everything up perfectly.
1570;whether you want to watch this movie for the horror, the possession or for the acting (without CGI) that accomplished some of its nostalgic scenes, it is a must see!
1571;The images of Regan being consumed by the demon are unforgettable and still vivid in my mind after almost 40 years.
1572;after seeing the movie I read the book by William Peter Blatty, and was pleased to see that the movie followed the book fairly well.
1573;In fact, because of the amazing visuals, the movie was actually scarier than the book in many ways.
1574;Even things that aren't really explained very well just add to the tension.
1575;In fact, almost no one in the film is having a very happy life.
1576;J. Cobb, who is intrigued by the murder mystery of the dead director and is delighted to be able to get Burstyn's (who plays a famous actress) autograph.
1577;I went to it because a friend of mine said, oh, it's about a priest and it has to do with religion and it's supposed to be scary.
1578;A perfect horror movie, still scary after all these years, has been enhanced with this very beautiful Blue Ray copy.
1579;When she finally calls on a psychiatrist/priest to examine her, he concludes that she does meet the criteria set by the Catholic church to receive an exorcism.
1580;this is as realistic as a horror movie can get.
1581;Maybe the best horror film ever made.
1582;If you got a party at your house and everybody is just smalltalkin around and you can't take it no more, just put in the EXORCIST and after 5 Minutes everybody will be quite with their eyes wide open.
1583;the story is so believable and the atmosphere is so convincing that it is impossible not to be frightend by this movie.
1584;"This is one of my two favorite horror movies (the other one is ""The ring"", please don't judge me for this)."
1585;If you have catholic beliefs, maybe you will be touch even more.
1586;the setup works like this: a twelve year old girl (played by Linda Blair in one of the most brilliant and controversial performances in horror movie history), estranged from her father, lives instead in Georgetown with her actress mother.
1587;for the scariest movie ever made.
1588;If you havent seen the Exorcist then you should see it already.
1589;This is one of the best horror movies of all time.
1590;I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great Blu/Ray set!
1591;This is one of my favorite movies.
1592;I just know the person loved the gift.
1593;I came look new, so because of that I will give a good evaluation.
1594;My God, Satan, here me you slime, stay away from my daughter!
1595;"The most powerful words to describe this type of movie is, "" the goodcan triumph over evil""."
1596;Over the 1800's, God won the battle in thegood vs. evil war with Satan himself.
1597;in which that means, always takeGod's side.
1598;Your posession is in the palmof your hands,and it's up to you to a rid of it once and for all.
1599;I love old horror movies.
1600;I love this movie from beginning to end.
1601;Well acted with some pretty damn believable special effects.
1602;Anyway I offer a HIGH recommendation for this one.
1603;Remember to hold on to your hats!
1604;This version's added footage explores the characters a little more, in particular the mother.
1605;Because it is happening to a little girl, and we see how much that hurts her mother.
1606;The scariest movie ever made?
1607;That is open to debate.
1608;What is for certain is that this is a nice piece of filmmaking that manages to be fun and disturbing at the same time.
1609;On one hand I think it is a great film about relationships with some brilliant performances .
1610;it's scarier than the entire film.
1611;In my book this is the most frightening movie I have ever seen, in a genre I love and dig deep into.
1612;The images and sounds, the multiple voices, and the uncredited dear Ms. McCambridge chilled me.
1613;ray, with absolutely no intention of viewing it, well maybe with a roomful of friends.
1614;now about the film: beautiful to look at, and I'm sure the blu.
1615;Great detail from a 35+ year old film, however.
1616;Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells theme is as haunting as ever, and the image of Merrin in the street light outside of the home is as classic a shot as they come.
1617;thank you Fathom, for a truly great event, and a chance for one person to revisit a nightmare of childhood, and remind me that.
1618;Even though I didnt get scared that much I still give it a ***** star rating!
1619;As I had read William Peter Blatty's book prior to the release of the movie, I remember the anticipation I felt knowing the film version was in the works.
1620;And thinking that if the producers / director could manage to make a film that was just a fraction as good as the book, they would have an incredible movie on their hands.
1621;The build up to the possession and the evil embodied by the possessed Reagan was done so beautifully as director William Friedkin ever so slowly provided small clues of what was to come.
1622;And finally, that incredible shot of Merrin stading on a rock facing a demonic staue and his knowledge that it's a premonition of things to come.
1623;"he created this incredible sense of tension that was allowed to build and build until it finally just ""exploded"" and when it did, it was absolutely riveting."
1624;"the ""story"" about the priest who has doubts about his own faith was also a very strong one as well."
1625;in a sensory world where we have difficulty believing in anything we can't see with our eyes / microscope / telescope, perhaps there are things that are beyond our understanding and comprehension.
1626;regardless of your religious beliefs, this is a film that can be appreciated and possibly enjoyed by everybody.
1627;is that it actually happens and is making a comeback!
1628;Despite some excessively, and unnecessary, indulgent visual trickery, Friedkan's mid 70's masterpiece about evil incarnate stands as one of the finest films of its respective genre.
1629;"especially from Von Sydow and MIller
1630;Basically, if you like the film, you are going to love the box set.
1631;The Box itself is well made and looks wonderful.
1632;Plus an introduction by William Friedkin, the director.
1633;from the film and the original score, plus a film frame and 8 lobby cards.
1634;Anyway, it is still well worth having.
1635;Just keep it at the same level as the theatre viewing experience, to appreciate those numerous and genius scene transitions.
1636;The movie is even better than I remembered.
1637;So The Exorcist will always be the most scariest f. g movie of all time.
1638;Blatty did his homework for the novel and Friedkin brought it to life.
1639;When the film THE EXORCIST was released in 1973, the huge sales of the Peter William Blatty novel guaranteed an equally smashing film success.
1640;Friedkin wisely allows the possession to encroach on Regan by degree.
1641;When I saw, this for the first time I was scared, I own the 25th edition the making scared me, well if you like horror films this is the, one.
1642;My daughter and her friends (ages 13 ~ 15) wanted to watch it, so I watched it with them.
1643;I mistakenly thought this was that addition.
1644;ray of The Exorcist is perfect.
1645;The new documentary included includes a ton of never before seen behind the scenes footage.
1646;This new hi def transfer shows off every detail of Dick Smith's brilliant make.
1647;The opening scenes in Iraq have so much depth and scope.
1648;I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it and I was only twelve.
1649;This is the best horror movie I have ever seen!
1650;It's is a very scary film and will no doubt give you nightmares for months after seeing it.
1651;up, acting and great effects.
1652;it is truly scary/disturbing and chances are you won't be able to get to sleep for weeks after!
1653;One of the men working there is a 70.
1654;The film then jumps to the other side of the world, in Georgetown (Washington D. c.) A famous actress named Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) lives there with her pre.
1655;Regan is a very loveable child, but suddenly she starts to show strange behavior.
1656;He finally agrees to review Regan's condition.
1657;With the evidence he can collect, he may be able to get approval from the Church.
1658;cOMMENTS: In my honest opinion, this is the scariest film of all time.
1659;I had the pleasure of seeing this film in the theater when it was re.
1660;William Friedkin's directorial style was brilliant.
1661;The film also boasts a fine cast with great acting.
1662;William Peter Blatty wrote the screenplay based on his own 1971 novel, and it's fantastic.
1663;Not only is this a great horror film, it's a great character study.
1664;He knows that he has an on.
1665;Blatty's novel was actually inspired by a true story.
1666;Robbie was able to make his bed shake without touching it, as well as move several other objects without physical contact.
1667;I would recommend this film to anybody.
1668;It is a timeless classic.
1669;The Exorcist is one of those rare finds.
1670;It is a superbly crafted film with a great story and top.
1671;notch acting and it also manages to scare the you know what right out of you.
1672;They are still some of the best effects created in Hollywood.
1673;You'll be missing one of the best films made in the 70's and without a doubt the greatest horror movie of all time.
1674;Theexistence of evil and everything that it upholds sends chillsdown my spin and possibly to those who believe.
1675;ager Linda Blair possessed is one that is neverunforgettable.
1676;Excellent directing and great commentationon the new version.
1677;ray edition has two disks: the 1973 classic and the 2000 director's cut.
1678;The director's cut disk also has a three part documentary about the actual filming of the movie, the neighborhood that it's set in, and the movie's ongoing legacy.
1679;You will see how director William Freidkin set up the shots, moved the camera, motivated his cast, etc.
1680;I found it to be fascinating, and if you love this movie like I do, you'll eat it up.
1681;as for the actual movie, it remains a geniunely chilling experience to this day.
1682;Her progression from that little girl into the monster that she becomes is one of the most chilling stories in the history of movies.
1683;its an awesome movie every single minute you will be really scared.
1684;This in my opinion is the best horror film ever made.
1685;This movie has dated quite well and one thing I love about this film is that is doesn't rely on heavy handed special effect or computer produced creations.
1686;Overall a great film .
1687;It is amazing that a movie from 1973 can still have the effect it has today.
1688;The New Director's Cut, while having a superior sound mix, falters in comparison.
1689;going public)he bashes you over the head with it.
1690;It is simply amazing to me how well this film has held up over the years.
1691;For my money, it is still one of the most effective movies ever made.
1692;It is intense, serious, thought provoking, and hypnotic all at once.
1693;a great story, great writing, and great film editing.
1694;There are certain scenes of exorcism, with Max Von Sydow and the great, nearly forgotten Jason Miller, which are the most powerful in screen history.
1695;lee J. Cobb (another great actor that is slipping from public memory) is memorable as Lieutenant Kinderman, and Ellen Burstyn seems to be living the movie more than acting within it.
1696;so many advances in the technology of filmmaking and even ways that we view or think of a movie.
1697;A human soul is possessed by the Devil.
1698;It had some great scenes and a good story line.
1699;And the book goes into more detail so you will still have more to look forward to.
1700;If you do end up liking it you will have found a great horror story, if you don't you will have something to make fun of later.
1701;Apart from minor roles in one of the sequels to The Exorcist, and a reporter role in one of the Scream movies, she'll always be known for playing Regan.
1702;They're both equally interesting, and are done to milk you of your hard.
1703;If I see the other one at a decent price, with the extras, I'll be getting it.
1704;The best (and hardest to notice) being the faint image of the demon Pezuzuu (sp?)
1705;They are just trailers that we've seen last month on, yeah, the tv and radio.
1706;its because of the images it shows you that disturbs you so deeply.
1707;even today, The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie ever made and one of the greatest american films ever and it lives up to that excpectation.
1708;the film tells of an actress who calls upon two priest to save her daughter who is possessed by the devil.
1709;every performance in this film is flawless but the true star is Linda Blair as the possessed girl, she brought so much force to a demanding role and she did it so well she has made Regan McNeal one of the biggest baddies in history.
1710;Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller also give some great performances to boast this film that if it wasent up against The Sting it definantly would have won the oscar for best picture.
1711;The Exorcist is one of my all time favorite films and i have recomended it to everyone who hasent seen it.
1712;Best filmmaking and it was the seventies!
1713;I remember first seeing The Exorcist years ago.
1714;I applaud the use of brilliant special effects, superb acting, and a screenplay that takes all the best elements of the novel to create a tightly wound, disturbing and see.
1715;this is in the top 10 of my all.
1716;It is powerful with vivid images, dialogue and characters.
1717;At the heart is a basic good vs. evil tale.
1718;Anyone who appreciates good cinema should check this out.
1719;this edition of the film features behind.
1720;scenes footage as well as interviews with the actors and crew members.
1721;The documentary is fascinating just by itself.
1722;This is one that continues to captivate audiences, and it belongs on the shelf of every horror fan.
1723;Thirty years later and I still find The Exorcist a powerful, disturbing, and amazing work of art.
1724;William Friedkin's direction is superb, the score including Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS still one of the best, and the whole project an exercise in terror.
1725;Let's go beyond the obvious special effects and the frightening possession of Regan McNeil, and look at the stunning performances Friedkin elicited.
1726;ellen Burstyn is outstanding"
1727;ridden role of Father Karras is mesmerizing.
1728;Tormented and doubting his faith, he nonetheless conquers these and propels the movie's grueling climax.
1729;max von Sydow as Father Merrin is brilliant in his subtle performance of a man near death faced with the unbelievable task of exorcising not just a demon, but the devil himself.
1730;linda Blair's performance is all the more amazing in that as everyone knows, Mercedes McCambridge mouthed the demon's voice, but Linda was there physically and her agony (especially in those awful hospital tests) demonstrates what potential she had, that was unfortunately never fully tapped in later films.
1731;kitty Winn as Burstyn's personal assistant was also very good in a supporting, almost invisible role.
1732;a true classic in any genre.
1733;There's few horror films that you can return to, and still find something genuinely frightening each time.
1734;"One exception, is 1973's ""The Exorcist"", based on the best selling novel by William Peter Blatty (who directed and wrote ""The Exorcist III based on his novel ""Legion,"" which represents the true sequel to the original novel)."
1735;a feeling of hope, and faith that goodness can prevail against evil, no matter how sinister in nature.
1736;The acting is supurb by all those involved.
1737;Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, and Lee J Cobb are so convincing, that every word they utter rings true.
1738;Honestly, there's not a bad performance in this entire cast, and the dialogue is simply fantastic.
1739;Freidkin is a skilled director, and the film has a documentary.
1740;This film takes itself seriously, and we are drawn into the horror because everyone is convinced that this is real.
1741;echoing the homeless man's words precisely.
1742;Surely, the demon has the ability to see beyond the confines of Regans bedroom.
1743;Ah, it's the unanswered questions such as these that makes this film so intriguing.
1744;Watch it once, then watch it again.
1745;The sound is just as masterful as every other aspect of the film.
1746;Times have changed, and horror films have become increasingly violent and gory, but this wonderful film from 1973 has never been duplicated in the sheer amount of terror it delivers.
1747;I suspect that it will continue to haunt the minds of its viewers for years to come.
1748;I still rate it high enough, simply for being ahead of its time.
1749;releases is still quite scary!
1750;I saw this film as a young man and it still is one of the only movies that sends chills up my spine.
1751;For those of you that like The Exorcist and wondered if you should have seen the movie in the theaters *just* becuase it has some new scenes I can tell you it's definataly worth it.
1752;the soundtrack is radically reworked as well, employing newly scored music that adds to the mood of the movie.
1753;it was great to see this in a theater and see people jaded by cookie cutter slasher flicks respond to this movie so well.
1754;the possessed girl is probabaly one of the scariest faces in movie history.
1755;It's incredible that all that was really done to Linda Blair's face was to add a few asymetrical cuts, cover over her eyebrows and darken her sockets (giving her eyes a skull like look).
1756;The crowning feature of the scariest face was the unhuman look of the eyes, done with contact lenses.
1757;The face can pop up at any moment in you life and that is scary.
1758;it is the scariest movie because what movie can still scare you years later by just remembering the face of thedevil on that child's face.
1759;One of the best movies of all times.
1760;When I was young, it was the effects and the shocks.
1761;that incredibly sinister prologue for one.
1762;That is truly great film making .
1763;it gets you right where you live.
1764;My friends and family think I am so strange for saying that this is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen.
1765;The lines that Linda Blair has to say to the priest and others are soooooo funny.
1766;At the same time it can still be very moving.
1767;I was incredibly excited when I found they were releasing the re.
1768;This has been one of my favorite movies for years, and it will probably always remain that way.
1769;from the middle of the movie on, WOW!
1770;I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was nine years old.
1771;For the first time, people are able to come face to face with The Devil himself.
1772;I saw it last night and let me tell you.
1773;this movie deserved best horror film in '73.
1774;so you be the judge.
1775;It is definitely scary :) would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch scary movies and actually be scared!!!
1776;inducing) is a must see.
1777;info on the true story behind the film.
1778;is startlingly good all around.
1779;the documentary is one of the most well.
1780;theme is a great peice of work (the story on Fredkin's choosing of the composition is in the documentary).
1781;nOTE: Best if viewed with a group of friends (who haven't seen it before), in the dark, at night.
1782;saw it, wanted it, had a fit, now own it,.
1783;The acting in this movie was simply phenomenal, and the story of an innocent child being taken over by diabolical forces is so unsettling.
1784;Other than that, the added scenes really give more substance to this film.
1785;Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made.
1786;After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.
1787;"linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan
1788;All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice.
1789;She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid.
1790;Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary.
1791;The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying.
1792;According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater.
1793;The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute.
1794;Everytime you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat.
1795;The actors"
1796;Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.
1797;tHE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life.
1798;Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time.
1799;This is the most realistic and most documetary.
1800;William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness.
1801;The scary thing about it is, is that this movie is based on a true story.
1802;So all of you people who say this is a great movie, you just make evil seem so good.
1803;This 40 year old movie has held up well.
1804;why is it still considered one the the sacriest films of all time??
1805;friedkin is a very talented director, and was at the prime of his art when he did the Exorcist2.
1806;It was one the the first films to tackle the supernatural in such a style, as opposed to vampires, draculas, zombies and giant tarantulas that was the staple diet of the horror genre.
1807;most crucially, using the innocence of a young girl, (played so well by Linda Blair, her first role and most important to date), as a platform for evil.
1808;the music is an integral part of the mood of the film, and using Mike Oldfield's 'The Sentinel', added a lot to the scary atmosphere.
1809;and the acting is all excellent, esp.
1810;If by chance you believe in Heaven and Hell, this movie is spooky!
1811;Excellent film, even after over 40 years!
1812;An excellent addition to my horror collection!
1813;The special effects still hold chilling value, the acting is still top notch, and the atmosphere still packs a mighty punch.
1814;I am a big fan of the movie in general and the additional footage enhances the film.
1815;It does not have the additional footage but it has a fantastic 78 minute documentary about the making of the movie.
1816;In fact, the documentary is almost as interesting as the movie!
1817;the film is beautifully photographed and acted.
1818;The mood is chilling and the music effective.
1819;I'll stick to the old.
1820;The Exorcist has a most unique story as far as demon possession goes.
1821;It's not exactely the scariest movie of all time but it does keep you glued to the screen for most of the movie.
1822;This film might scare little kids but teens and adults will find it interesting.
1823;Apart from that, a fantastic performance from Linda Blair as the possessed girl and lots of very grusome and disturbing effects that are very convincing.
1824;OK This is not only one of the scariest movies ever made, it's also one of the best!
1825;If you keep that in mind while you watch this movie .
1826;so sit back, open your mind, and prepare to run to church .
1827;I can watch over and over and still get goosebumps.
1828;Max Von Sydow a favorite of mine.
1829;The locations in Exorcist are great.
1830;after considerable introspection and healing.
1831;i still find this movie engaging and shocking.
1832;what were once cutting edge 'special effects' or plot lines now seem quaint and detract .
1833;I love that this was based on a dozen (or more) true stories too, that makes it even scarier than it already is.
1834;I recommend this for the experienced horror fan/critic ONLY.
1835;From beginning to end, this is the best horror film ever made.
1836;The story is chilling and REAL, maybe too real for alot of people.
1837;The performances are outstanding,especially JASON MILLER as FATHER KARRAS, still, in my opinion, one of the greatest dramatic performances I have ever seen from a Supporting actor.
1838;This film challenges you, shakes you to your core, and will keep you awake for nights on end.
1839;It truly ranks up there with the best films ever made for so many reasons.
1840;It will lend insight into the making of such an awe.
1841;Horror films have gotten progressively worse as the years have worn on, maybe the reason is that they had this masterpiece as the measuring stick.
1842;best and first evil movie, plus also the original and still scariest of all demon movies.
1843;Great acting, a little scary, and plot was perfect.
1844;This film is also shear genius and an art onto itself.
1845;The green pea soup and head spinning has become synonymous in our every day vocabulary that is associated with this masterpiece of a horror film.
1846;We are given glimpses into the holiness of the Church, superstition into the unknown, fear of the inevitable, the monsterous and supernatural power that is potentially in each and every one of us, and the doubt of all that is good in this dark world.
1847;This is THE scariest movie I have ever, ever seen.
1848;The story is decent, and what I liked best about the film is that they pulled out all the stops.
1849;This is a classic, and the 5 stars I give this one too is directly related to the fact that this is too terrifying to watch.
1850;One of the few religious stories that has had a profound effect on all aspects of life outside of people's religous lives.
1851;After over 30 years of being made it still gives people chills and frights that will last for hours after watching this film.
1852;this movie is one of the most bone chilling horror movies ever made.
1853;A must see for everyone.
1854;Now I am surprised even more that the Exorcist still remains quite original and unique in its own kind.
1855;As director Friedkin puts it in his intro to the film, he wanted to do a realistic movie about extraordinary events .
1856;And it works out just like that,which makes it gripping in a peculiar way.
1857;Worth the thrill for any movie lover.
1858;It features a refreshing balance of drama and horror.
1859;The horror builds very gradually, almost seeping into the lives of the main characters.
1860;the best horror movie ever made.
1861;in fact this is the ONLY movie that still scares me to this day.
1862;the story,acting and effects all came together just right right to form a horror masterpeice the likes of which hasnt been seen since and might never be seen again.
1863;A Hollywood interpretation of a true story.
1864;Damn, this film scared the heebie.
1865;20 years went pass before I was able to watch this movie again and add it to my movie collection.
1866;None of these options presents the film in a completely satisfying edition, though the 25th anniversary disc comes close.
1867;Contrast levels are sometimes quite good while black levels are rarely deep or solid.
1868;however, the 25th anniversary edition contains a BBC documentary on the film, the inspiration for the novel, and, a thoroughly engrossing back story on exorcisms.
1869;"Minus the documentary, I recommend the 25th anniversary edition over ""the version you've never seen before."""
1870;Good classic American horror that will surely leave you with chills, perfect for a late night date movie to curl up with someone special
1871;old girl who becomes manifested by a truly malevolent spirit.
1872;william Friedkin brilliantly directed, and Blatty adapted the screenplay (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced.
1873;The cast gives extraordinary, sensitive performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair were all nominated for Academy Awards) and the special effects are breathtaking and still pack a punch, with veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the evil entity.
1874;(The film also won for Best Achievement In Sound).
1875;The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is evident, his philosophy being, if there's all this evil out there, why is there so much good?
1876;sacrificing moment, Karras finds his faith again and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child.
1877;A truly terrifying, engrossing and ultimately touching film dealing with faith and human frailty.
1878;Still a classic horror story without unneeded excessive gore thanks to a great script and excellent acting!
1879;The movie is great what with the direction and editing, but I'm glad I could get this version as opposed to something gratuitous.
1880;And man, did I get it at a great deal!
1881;I bought it for three dollars, and it's basically new.
1882;the only way to exocise the Devil is with fearless, relentless, gut.
1883;drenched courage, courage in the face of all the demons of Hell.
1884;tHE I'm OK, HOU'RE OK cHUFCH, THE Churxch that says, it's ok to sit, don't have to kneel, don't have to fast, you should always be happy, you have a right to be hapy, and, best of all, we are ALL going to Heaven.
1885;shaking courage, foubned in a 2000 some year oldfaith that has sustained much of mankind for two millennium.
1886;Still, this is a 12 year old girl, daughter of an American actress at her wits end and somewhat convincing, via Ellen Burnstyn's acting.
1887;moving and touching scene, with the two churchmen suiting up, displays the reverence the men of the Church used to show their office, especially when no one was watching.
1888;A must see and a good movie with lots of popcorn and the lights OUT.
1889;I have seen many horrormovies, and I am a big fan of the Genre.
1890;But nothing have ever made me cry of pure fear like that night I watched The Exorcist, and that alone makes it the perfect movie ever.
1891;They all bring this movie to such an reality that has to be seen to believe.
1892;The acting are superb, the sounds, the filming, everything is dead on.
1893;For those who are interested in religion, it is certainly interesting, and for those who love the paranormal, it is too(I am an atheist, but I study the paranormal).
1894;but dont ever dare make fun of this movie.
1895;the Exorcist is the greatest horrorfilm ever, and possibly one of the greatest FILMS ever too.
1896;love it how can u not the original.
1897;what have I missed?So I eventually got the tape and watched it and while I agree that it's a great movie, I can see the building on purpose, the tricks that make it great.
1898;Blend that with mood and stellar acting and you have a first rate movie.
1899;Its good for completionists but in no way advances the film or adds a new dimension.
1900;Exorcist, is the first movie applying such technique to increase the horrific effects, and also it brought the subliminal issues to the attention of the public.
1901;Certainly fans will enjoy that.
1902;the premise is quite cerebral.
1903;He goes to study the girl and discovers something diabolical at work.
1904;The nut grabbing scene has an extra facial demon effect inserted along with new sound.
1905;A long period of blackness is added to the film after this scene.
1906;The tape recording sequence has some additional scenes of Karras listening to the tape.
1907;The exorcism scene has been mostly reedited with additional sound effects and special effects.
1908;Dyer and Kinderman have a new reedited conversation in the end.
1909;in short this is a whole new version of the Exorcist and is certainly worth watching.
1910;Just make sure that you read the book too!
1911;Even though over time the major scare scenes have become known, the film itself is so well put.
1912;together and the performances so compelling that it holds up remarkably well and it's still a hell of a movie.
1913;I'm a great fan of this movie since i have memory, and i know every detail of it, and i can say that with the blu ray version, i could see the diference in sound (amazing) and in the image, included i could see the thin ropes in the levitation scene.
1914;one of the best movies ever made, you can watched again and again .
1915;and still enjoy, great movie.
1916;scariest movie ever made,huh,yeah right.
1917;The idea of a movie that focuses on the demonic possession of a little girl is innovative to say the least, but The Exorcist took the concept to an entirely new level not just in its special effects and shocking visuals and language, but also in its religious, philosophical, and psychological pondering as well.
1918;what is great about this plot is how is moves deliberately and slowly towards its conclusion.
1919;another benefit to this pacing is that it creates an ensemble of believable characters.
1920;In fact, she gives an absolutely convincing performance as time goes on and her daughter gets worse and it makes the viewer sympathize more for her dilemma.
1921;but it's the possessed Regan that steals the show.
1922;Most of the most memorable parts of the movie are involving Regan, some of the dialogue is delightful, and of coarse when we get to the exorcism, the special effects really kick into overdrive.
1923;They are really well done and add a convincing element of creepiness to the possessed Regan, but you have to see them to really appreciate it.
1924;aside from the makeup, the camera work is also spectacular in the way all the scenes are shot.
1925;It is also worthy to note that it takes the appearance of a demon to inspire faith in Chris and Karras rather than the word of the Lord, but it is so often the case that people's faith is not inspired by good, but rather by the bad in life.
1926;perhaps the best aspect of the film is its utterly chilling atmosphere.
1927;the Exorcist is a great blend of ingredients that makes a spectacular film.
1928;This is why The Exorcist is still so effective and why it is simply the greatest film dealing with the subject of possession to this day.
1929;Brilliantly acted, you almost swear that Jason Miller (Father Karras)is a real priest the same goes for Max Von Sydow (Father Marin).
1930;Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair hold their own beautiful acting performances.
1931;The thing I really liked about the Excorcist was its really great sound effects, truly an audio marvel in 1973,1974 movies.
1932;This movie will have you thinking about it well after you have watched it.
1933;A timeless film that has lost some of its shock value but has and will stand the test of time.
1934;The Excorcist won a 1973 Oscar for best adapted screenplay by William Peter Blatty.
1935;The movie was suspense, very scary and great actors!
1936;Thank you, I will watch it often.
1937;ray disc because ever since I got my Blu.
1938;the Exorcist is one of My favorite movie's and I think it's also a very important movie.
1939;I guarantee all the good reviews are from older people who grew up to this movie.
1940;Them good ol days , haha makes me laugh.
1941;I saw it once and that's going to be it for a while.
1942;It has a great story and a real ending.
1943;i have never seen this version but the origonal was a very good and spoky.
1944;Few movies had resulted in such a heated cultural debate and reaction.
1945;some of those scenes made it onto the Anniversary Edition, in the excellent attached documentary made for British television by Mark Kermode.
1946;"off the ""discovered footage,"" to see if any more profit could be squeezed from the movie, which had already enjoyed several successful theatrical re."
1947;"It is an uplifting and illuminating moment, and it is very interesting that Friedkin lied about the scene's existence, although at one time he was quoted as saying it was like ""stopping for a commercial."
1948;"If there simply is not enough of ""The Exorcist"" to be had, this version is of special interest to the collector."
1949;It is an actual re.
1950;cutting of a classic American movie.
1951;For the diehard fan, at least watching it once is necessary.
1952;This continues to be the scariest movie I've ever seen.
1953;I believe it's due to the excellent character development and great story line .
1954;it helps me relate to the characters.
1955;In terms of a MOVIE this is clearly one of the best ever made.
1956;Only the Godfather I and II compares to it, in terms of performances, (not a single bad one) Special effects and plot it is incredible.
1957;It slowly builds up until you just can't take it anymore.
1958;All the people involved in this movie should be rightly proud.
1959;I know Linda Blair's career has paid a price for this but very few great actors have ever made a movie as great as this one.
1960;I would rank it in the top 10 of all time easy, maybe even top 5.
1961;this movie not only scares me it is the ONLY movie that still does.
1962;Will he have the faith to keep up, to do the rite again and again and again.
1963;With they have what it takes to outlast the demon.
1964;He willingly accepts the devil into himself and thus gives Satan the actual win he is looking for.
1965;i bought this and was very satisfied.
1966;i saw the exorcst years ago and this is the extended version makes it even better than the original film.
1967;This film created quite a stir when it was first released.
1968;"I've seen ""The Exorcist"" numerous times now and still enjoy it."
1969;The special effects and shock factor may seen mild by today's standards but the fact is it is a very well.
1970;made film with excellent acting, production values and music.
1971;Ellen Burstyn should have won the Best Actress Oscar for this.
1972;The films takes time to develop characters and develop a realistic feel.
1973;I think that is why it is so successful.
1974;warner always does an excellent job with their catalog titles, and The Exorcist is no exception.
1975;Both versions of the film look and sound great.
1976;the extras here are really something special.
1977;Scares me every time, Classic my favorite movie bar none I think I will watch it again right now Smiles
1978;Director William Friedkin perfectly combines all aspects of horror from the psychological to the gross.
1979;Ellen Burstyn is marvelous in the role of Chris McNeil and Linda Blair gives the performance of her life as Regan McNeil, the possessed girl.
1980;Both Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are excellent as the priests brought in the perform the exorcism.
1981;The film was a major triumph, becoming at the time the all time highest grossest movie in history.
1982;The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture, Mr. Friedkin for Best Director, Ms. Burstyn for Best Actress, Ms. Blair for Best Supporting Actress and Mr. Miller for Best Supporting Actor, but only took home two awards, one for Best Sound and the other by William Peter Blatty for Best Writing, Screenplay based on another medium which he adapted from his own novel.
1983;After watching this you'll likely reclaim your faith.
1984;If you've never seen THE EXORCIST, or haven't seen it in a long time, this is a great opportunity to add this classic horror film to your library!The acting, directing, cinematography, sound track and special effects all stand up well to the test of time.
1985;"Of special note is that both the special effects and the Tubular Bells music are still wonderful, not at all ""period."""
1986;Max von Sydow is also particularly memorable as Father Merrin.
1987;It's as chilling and realistic as you remember.
1988;this was still top notch.
1989;True, it is based upon a real account of a young boy who was legitimately possessed by a demon according to the Catholic Church which gave permission to perform an exorcism resulting in such similar occurrences of supernatural and blasphemous phenomenon that is so meticulously portrayed in the movie.
1990;"selling novel) the role of the young boy has been switched to a young girl (the sweet and oh so young Linda Blair) who, after playing with a ouija board, develops a friendship with a spirit named ""Captain Howdy"" who turns out to be none other than the Devil himself."
1991;The epic final scenes are unbelievably nerve.
1992;But the problem I have (as a Christian) with the movie isn't the unremitting blasphemies of the Devil (he is, after all, the Devil and it is an accurate portrayal despite the in.your.
1993;This is one of my all time favorite films.
1994;I remember it when it was first released and still regard it highly as a brilliant piece of cinematic art.
1995;Even though I loved seeing the additional footage, I thought the subliminals and the added musical score took away from the uniqueness of the film.
1996;The ascetic way that Friedkin originally presented the film was one of the main reasons the film was so incredible and effective.
1997;I agree with Friedkin and feel the original film is just fine and I don't think that the ending leaves one with a negative feeling.
1998;This film is an incredible piece of work and is one of the top 10 films ever made, regardless of what AFI may think.
1999;That documentary also showed footage of Ellen and Linda walking around town and sight seeing.
2000;This new version was good, but there's still another version we've never seen out there.
2001;Maybe we'll see it one day.
2002;Still, this movie is one of my all.
2003;The cast is amazing, with Ellen Burstyn providing some good dramatic moments.
2004;It is truly a great film.
2005;The acting is first class, and the basic idea is extremely original, and quite disturbing.
2006;Because it was simply not scary.
2007;however, it is still an absolutely superb film in it's direction, topic, acting, and all other things.
2008;Was very happy with the speed of delivery and packaging.
2009;This version with the extra scenes and extra images of the demon Pazuzu in some scenes is really great.
2010;An excellent movie, in its own respect.
2011;Should definitely be seen by (open.
2012;With 75+ minutes of interviews (not including the commentaries), it is worth owning this classic.
2013;It is in the top 20 grossing films, for good reason.
2014;When the movie came out I already heard a lot of the advance publicity but I was still deeply engrossed when I watched it for the first time.
2015;It is a movie that will challenge you in many ways yet it is also a movie that has the potential to reassure you are well.
2016;made movie complete with great writing, acting, directing, and, above all, great special effects.
2017;Even after all of these years, they still are impressive.
2018;The theatre was fairly full when we went in.
2019;There is a strong element of hardcore Christian good versus demonic evil and you can get caught up in this.
2020;Okay, this film deserves 5 stars.
2021;It is, after all, still the most shockingly frightening film EVER.
2022;This one still gives me the chills.
2023;Of course, there are new scenes.yes, yes, yes, the famous spider.
2024;walk scene is fantastic (and chilling).
2025;I'm afraid the director's commentary isn't enough to keep me satisfied, but this is still worthy of your money . . . and a place in your collection.
2026;The Exorcist is a movie that has drawn my curiosity ever since I was a kid.
2027;the interesting things that I found in the movie were Max von Sydow's acting and the use of sound in the movie.
2028;I found it interesting how von Sydow plays the exorcist Fr.
2029;I must admit I think Max von Sydow's performance in both movies was remarkable.
2030;"A simple restored scene from ""The Exorcist"" that I think demonstrates Von Sydow's film presence is when he (as Fr."
2031;"Merrin) says ""What a lovely name"" in response to finding out Regan's middle name."
2032;It is Max's unique voice and acting that gives presence and credibility to his role as a priest and exorcist.
2033;Merrin all the more likeable and credible.
2034;Karras believing that Regan has multiple personalities).
2035;She states that she has no religious beliefs and yet she continually uses the Lord's name in vain.
2036;It is a brilliant scene because it delivers the message to the viewer that anything associated with the devil is unnatural.
2037;I believe the movie's power to frighten can be attributed to 2 factors.
2038;What a difference a few minutes of footage can make!
2039;The extra footage adds an even more solid, subtle base to the overall tale, and yes, the 'spider walk', brief as it is, is a welcomed sight.
2040;The director simply tells you what you already know as far as the story itself as it moves along.
2041;ons behind the film you see.
2042;He scarcly mentions much about the new scenery added, and while talking about the scene in the doctor's office, there's a fun 'echo' as he says exactly what the characters are saying, but he's telling it like it's supposed to be informative for the listener, haha!
2043;To this day, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.
2044;Unlike many horror movies, it actually has a story to tell, which is brilliantly written by William Peter Blatty.
2045;Starring a very young Linda Blair, who took on a really big role at a very young age, and did a fantastic job with it.
2046;This movie will get into you.
2047;She said it was one of the chilling and scariest movie she ever saw.
2048;Linda Blair did a great job portraying the role.
2049;As if this horror flic isn't scary enough, the Exorcist was actually inspired by the authentic, nearly two.
2050;month long exorcism performed in 1949 on a 14.
2051;well after watching this movie, I was so impressed that I decided to read the novel, written by William Peter Blatty.
2052;"I must say that ""The Exorcist"" truly does justice to the text it is based on."
2053;they can all be explained away by modern psychology (well.
2054;in fact, up till the novel's conclusion, the author (Blatty) does such a superb job of describing the psychological aspects of Regan's behavior that I was continually caught between the belief that she was truly possessed, and the notion that she was mentally ill.
2055;What's more, I highly recommend reading the novel.
2056;I thought that this movie was pretty good.
2057;It was the scariest and coolest horror movie that i've ever seen.
2058;This movie got me interested in horror movies.
2059;i am telling you this is the funniest movie ever made for horror.
2060;I think it was a good movie but it was very funny.
2061;I especially enjoy the scene in which Linda Blair pretens to be and airplane.
2062;A down angle shot that includes all of them.
2063;this is by far the scariest movie ever made.
2064;The acting in this movie is brilliant, the story is great and it was well directed everything that happens in the movie is for a reason and fits well together.
2065;He comes across something ancient that has the face of a demon.
2066;Her mother wonderfully played by Ellen Burstyn is an actress working on a movie.
2067;Some of these scenes are the scariest I have seen in any movie.
2068;the last 1/2 hour of the movie is very gripping and scary.
2069;This makes for more intense scenes.
2070;I highly recommend this movie if you really want to get scared!!!
2071;Often voted such, The Exorcist deserves it, nearly in its own class.
2072;movies like The Blair Witch project , The Others and Ringu invoking memories of such classics as Don t look Now and The Shining .
2073;Look closely at any of the more recent critically acclaimed Horror flicks and you'll see a common trend .
2074;Just solid acting, excellent direction and excellent production.
2075;Real Actors with Real Characters to portray in settings that are.
2076;"The Exorcist falls firmly into this category
2077;For that reason alone the excellent performances, beautifully shot direction and exquisite scoring are allowed to shine through, and the movie is today, a whopping 31 years after its original release, and every bit as compelling and powerful as it was back in 1973.
2078;it is a strong testament to the superficiality of the modern Academy Awards system that Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar.
2079;Here is a performance with depth, truth and believability .
2080;she is a Mother, she is on the Edge.
2081;Burstyn's remarkable talent shines through in this picture and the fear and tension she herself creates is alone worthy of praise.
2082;Blair as Regan is good, she is a perfectly sweet and innocent creature as Regan, and in the scenes where she is being taken over by Pazuzu (the Demon), she displays a rare talent in child actors .
2083;the ability to create drama without histrionics.
2084;Miller as Karras is similarly excellent as the tortured, moody priest wrestling with his faith, and the scenes between him and his elderly Mother are simultaneously tender and grim.
2085;Von Sydow does a good job with the role of Merrin, but he's somewhat peripheral to the central core of the story.
2086;William Friedkin has used a sharp, choppy style of camerawork to suggest violence born out of normality, and it works beautifully here.
2087;The opening scenes in Iraq and the Exorcism itself draw some interesting parallels .
2088;monochromatic and stark, they compliment each other nicely and, in and of themselves, are excellent 'ends' to the movie.
2089;the score is perfect, animal voices and sharp strings (as well as Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of Pazuzu, check her out alongside Joan Crawford in spaghetti western Johnny Guitar ) add an aural tension that's rarely been matched, and the whole production screams of professionalism.
2090;the extra material is good, the 'Spider.
2091;It was well written and entertaining, though I questioned the subject.
2092;the rest of us will just laugh at it.
2093;I guarantee you it will be scarier and more entertaining!
2094;This is certainly a great made Horror movie, but honestly .
2095;Still, a good, worth watching movie, I love the first scenes and the music at the beginning.
2096;Still the Granddaddy of scary films.
2097;A bit dated, but as I watch, I am struck by the incredible sound effects throughout the movie.
2098;Kudos to Mercedes McCambridge, for a vocal terror fest.
2099;There has YET to be a Wide.
2100;This movie still rocks though.
2101;this is what a great.
2102;This two disc set features much to enjoy.
2103;well ridiculously good, better than they ever did and the note included from Director William Friedkin speaks to that work.
2104;The NEW bonus features are really truly the mother lode.
2105;containing not only new interviews with the main contributors in front of and behind the camera but loads of exciting behind the scenes footage showing just how all these incredible effects and make up etc were achieved.
2106;This is housed in a classy book with great photos and bios and all for about $25 .
2107;and they DID carry over the excellent British documentary and bonus interviews from the 25th anniversary edition.
2108;this was a landmark film and this is a definitive and spectacular presentation!!!
2109;Picture and sound is superb and I reccommend it to all who want to know more about evil in this world.
2110;It is compelling on its own account.
2111;christian who believes in God and the palpable existence of his fallen angel, Satan, will find this film profoundly disturbing and at the same time spiritually uplifting.
2112;Perhaps it has to do with the fact that it appeals to my Roman Catholic heritage and the fear of the Devil that countless nuns instilled in us.
2113;So when I heard that a new version of the film was being released with added footage I was quite excited.
2114;Fans of the original version will most likely enjoy this one as well.
2115;Much of what is added serves to make the viewer even more sympathetic to Regan's plight.
2116;In the orignal we see Fr.
2117;Dyer wave as the car pulls away with Regan in it.
2118;I saw this for the first time as a young schoolboy and it made a powerful impact on me.
2119;It really is a deeply religious movie with the overlaying theme of good versus evil.
2120;Especially mesmerizing is the scenes with the possessed Regan and Karras and their conversations.
2121;This is one of the greatest thriller/horror movies made and I'd strongly suggest reading the book for additional flavor.
2122;It's still shocking even today.
2123;Oh boy it truly scares me a lot!
2124;if you're brave enough to viewed this film go ahead.
2125;It's always tempting to say, """"Those effects were great."""
2126;but I am happy to report that in a very recent, pre.
2127;halloween viewing, THE EXORCIST has withstood the test of time nearly unscathed.
2128;The clothing is often hilariously tacky.
2129;Technology is primitive.Yet William Friedkin's classically styled direction of William Peter Blatty's effectively unsettling novel still has the uncanny ability to give us the creeps today.
2130;Often (VERY often) imitated, but not yet equaled, THE EXORCIST is simply brilliant.
2131;But they are presented as a loving pair.
2132;"soon, though, Regan begins to exhibit strange behavior, including rather vivid tales of her talks with ""imaginary"" friends she clearly believes are real."
2133;Yes, that scene has been made fun of MANY times over the years.
2134;These scenes also have a matter.
2135;It's the CONTEXT in which they play out that works so well.
2136;And even though I knew the outcome, I was riveted to the film.
2137;stunned that I was still able to be creeped out even on my 4th viewing.
2138;The film is constructed so well and with no hint of irony.
2139;best of all, we've got a cast of fantastic actors playing their juicy roles completely seriously.
2140;Linda Blair is fearsome effective.
2141;even with the help of makeup and the voice of Mercedes McCambridge, she is a striking figure.
2142;His Det. Kinderman is a small role, but he brings a touch to it that gives the film a whiff of humor.
2143;he's done many, many great performances since.
2144;Finally, Jason Miller is dead perfect as Father Karras, who to me is the true heart.
2145;It is HIS personal journey that most gives this film gravitas.
2146;Miller was a very talented actor and writer.
2147;His performance ranks right up there with other greats of that era of the `70s when Method actors like Pacino and deNiro were making their big marks.
2148;by all means, see THE EXORCIST again.
2149;I believe you'll be as pleasantly surprised as me.
2150;There's a reason this film is deemed a classic.
2151;plus a VERY brief but unforgettable shot of Regan coming down some stairs in a very unconventional way.
2152;The opening sequence in Iraq looks nice and bright and it's a great contrast to the rest of the film.
2153;The sound is phenomenal and makes for a great cinematic experience in the comfort of your home.you're going to need that comfort!
2154;After some amusing attempts at medical treatment of demonic possession, Karras gets involved.
2155;It is, in fact it's a great film.
2156;In other words, had they kept the development and left out the painted face flashes, they'd probably have an excellent cut here.
2157;After 40 years, still holds up to terror.
2158;"The audio track commentaries also put the entire movie into its proper perspective
2159;The movie is actually a profound statement in support of faith in God and the ability of love and honor to overcome the powers of darkness.
2160;This is some pretty powerful stuff, particularly to non.
2161;Saw it in theater way back when it was first released.
2162;Although it does not share the same psychological suspense as The Silence of the Lambs , The Exorcist is a very tense film, as well as a horrifying look at pure evil.
2163;top demonic posession horror, the story is brilliant, and the movie is very tasteful in the way it represents itself.
2164;Some added scenes, such as the opening shots really added to film, and others [such as the highlights of the demon face] did not seem to really add much, but were still interesting additions.
2165;The 25th Anniversary has an excellent 74 minute documentary The Fear of God: The Making of 'The Exorcist' , full of interesting tid.
2166;It also has a commentary track with both the director William Friedkin and the writer/producer William peter Blatty.
2167;like commentary the rest of the time.
2168;The sound is finnally worth listening to, and there deleted scenes that are not to be missed!
2169;The movie is great, deservers 5 stars, this new version is cool, a bit longer but cool.
2170;This movie was great .
2171;It really was the scariest movie for its time.
2172;its a good movie .
2173;The best horror films effect us by being closer to what we believe to be true as opposed to being off.
2174;The closer a film comes to our own beliefs or experiences, the stronger its ability to move us emotionally.
2175;on a purely visceral level, the pacing of the movie is pure genius .
2176;This movie didn't scare me, but it was well made and I like the original version best.
2177;tubular Bells score is simply awesome, even now!
2178;By general consensus, this is the scariest of all mainstream films.
2179;one solid in his faith, the other doubt ridden .
2180;There are two commentaries, one with director William Friedkin and the other with writer/producer William Peter Blatty.
2181;There's hardly a word about the directing process, the subliminal shots, the brilliant sound design, behind the scenes events or even the spectacular effects.
2182;One gets the notion that Friedkin pretty much made this film by himself.
2183;This is the best movie ever made!From beginning to end it's as scary as hell!
2184;Great actors, great special effects, GREAT MOVIE!
2185;The very original possession movie!
2186;the director said it best when he said, a person brings to the exorcist what they are as a person and leave in the same fashion .
2187;this is a moving film on how people view this movie is what your opinon on good vrs.
2188;the movie's outline is more on faith vrs.
2189;and a wild ride into the closest thing your going to get to hell.
2190;The Exorcist is more then just a movie, it is an event, transcedent, powerful, but more importantly scary .
2191;william Friedkin, a masterful filmmaker, takes horror filmmaking to a new level.
2192;With its deliberate pacing, solid performances, and startling visuals, the Exorcist remains a powerful film some 25 years after its original theatrical release.
2193;this truly is the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none!So turn off the lights, turn up the sound, and shudder at the only horror film worth watching .
2194;what more needs to be said, great movie and ahead of its time, great effects both sound and visual.
2195;The performances are uniformly superb, from Ellen Burstyn's harrowing actress.
2196;And to top it all off, the story, a fantastical demonic possesion thriller dressed up like a faith diatribe, has an undeniable power, and makes you think.
2197;We are spiritual beings having a temporary human experience and spirits of all nature, including evils ones, exist.
2198;On top of that I like horror stories with a good story line and script, I do not enjoy the stupid blood and gore typical zombie, Jason or Freddie type of trash that is often put out.
2199;This movie, along with Exorcist III are movies with excellent acting, plots and scripts and deal with a real occurrence, the presence of malevolent spirits.
2200;This movie is a classic and should be watched again every few years.
2201;Even though this move shows its age it is still one of the scarier horror movies ever made.
2202;Horror is the right word to describe this classic confrontation of good and evil.
2203;He has battled with this nemesis before and now he has come to the end of his life with the battle unresolved.
2204;it won't be long before Chris seeks out the help of Father Karras with a problem she is having with her 12 year old daughter Regan, played wonderfully by Linda Blair, who won a Golden Globe for her performance.
2205;whatever the beliefs of the viewer, it is certain that the film is exceptionally well written, directed and acted.
2206;The author of the best selling novel (which I also recommend), William Peter Blatty, was unsure that he could adapt his novel into a first.
2207;An Academy Award for best screenplay in 1973 answered his question.
2208;Thirty years after this film was made it still has the power to chill us with its realistic portrayal of the ultimate horror, being possessed by the devil.
2209;the newer exorcist movies are much better, and more interesting.
2210;Let alone the best horror film ever made this film is a classic.
2211;If you haven't seen this movie already please do so soon, especially in the dark.
2212;Like I had said before this film definitely is a classic.
2213;but, I did watch it again today, 38 years later, and all I can say is that, it's not so scary.
2214;it is a movie that needs to be brought back to the big screen.
2215;it is a movie that will leave an impression on your life one way or another.
2216;it can still stand on it's own today.
2217;a movie that everyone needs to see at least once in there life.
2218;It's scary, but I laugh at certain parts lol .
2219;if you've only seen the original version and don't know what that is, the Director's Cut Extended Edition is a must see.
2220;definitely in my top five all time favorite movies.
2221;Definitely the greatest horror movie of all time!
2222;Still stands up after all these years, unlike any other horror movies and definitely quite a few regular movies as well!
2223;this film is extraordinarily well.
2224;the really chilling element that I have found bugs some people out , is that the Director uses some REAL audio from an actual exorcism to beef up the presence of the demonic sounds.
2225;if you are going to do a film on this genre, general topic area, then using the right material makes a big difference.
2226;however much the Director has to beef it up with cool ideas :.)
2227;also , get the 25th Anniversary edition for some great , and insightful extras.
2228;This is my favorite horror film for several reasons, though primarily because it is the only film to have truly frightened me.
2229;A large studio budget allows for a first rate production from top notch talent, which lends credibility and effectiveness to the film.
2230;In order to be effective, it is essential that a movie dealing with a subject such as supernatural phenomena be earnest and believable because if any single facet is done less than professionally, the viewer loses respect for it.
2231;By this point, the viewer is scared enough to deem this a wise decision on the part of Father Karras.
2232;It is also a compelling film because a higher power for good is invoked to combat the evil.
2233;While the film contains some fine performances, the one that stands out among them is Linda Blair's.
2234;She certainly earned the nomination she received for best actress in a supporting role, though she did not deserve all the ensuing adverse repercussions from appearing in the film.
2235;Mike Oldfield's """"Tubular Bells"""" provides a suitably eerie soundtrack for the film as well."""
2236;When one is young and has yet to form one's own viewpoints concerning faith or a belief system, the film can be quite terrifying.
2237;This film has been popular among people of the Catholic and even Christian faiths, though it is understandable why it might not appeal to those of other faiths.
2238;Regardless, this film stands well above most other horror films and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror film.
2239;Chances are pretty high that you will find it chilling.
2240;I saw the added footage version of the Exorcist in the theatres for the sole reason that I had always wanted to see it on the big screen.
2241;established the Exorcist's placement on the top of all horror movie lists.
2242;After all this film is a classic horror movie with creeping suspense, wonderful makeup effects (done by the ever so wonderful Dick Smith) and deeper sense of meaning then just a horror movie.
2243;I think what makes it so good is that while it uses make up and special effects in the movie it does not rely on them for popularity.
2244;I recommend that all horror fans check this out because it is really fantastic.
2245;This is my all time favorite horror flick.
2246;The Excorcist is probably one of the scariest movies ever made, with some of the most unforgettable scenes ever cought on film.
2247;I can't give away the ending but this movie will raise many a question as well as hairs while being viewed.
2248;truly this is a timeless classic and would make a great dating movie, this movie hopefully would chase the girl or guy for that matter into your arms, it is that scary.
2249;I have yet to try it out, but hopefully i can convince her to watch it.
2250;See my listmania list and other reviews for other great movies.
2251;Indeed, it was included and also that made it easier to understand it better
2252;This is indeed is the scariest movie of all time.
2253;at a time when all special effects are done by computer manipulation, this movie is filled with many actual effects, which brings a certain reality to this movie and makes every scene seem like it was actually happening.
2254;I believe the genuinely horrific effect of The Exorcist on the viewer (at least, on this Catholic boy!)
2255;is best explained by Blatty himself.
2256;at least, I believe it is.
2257;It's frightening but quite real.
2258;Its power to frighten derives from its credibility.
2259;Newsweek, in its review of the novel, said: 'The Exorcist is obscene in the highest possible sense.
2260;When you are made aware of that, it's laudable.
2261;The actors,Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, (all recieved Oscar nominations) are at thier best.
2262;It is a scary, powerful, movie.
2263;released and it was just a powerful.
2264;It is an exploration of faith, a complex struggle of good versus evil that stems from the conflicts that are present in each of our lives, combined with a theology lesson and the belief in something greater than ourselves.
2265;the story works on a number of levels.
2266;The visual experience of the film is horrifying, as Regan is transformed from an innocent little girl into the demon that possesses her.
2267;But what makes this film far more frightening than the visual images is the psychological effect it has on its viewer.
2268;This movie transcends the screen, and plays out like a literary work, giving incredible depth to each of its characters, making them very believable and easy to relate to.
2269;by the end of the story, the movie examines everything from the power of faith, to the power of darkness, and leave the viewer with an experience that will effect them to their very soul.
2270;It is an important film, and not one to be taken lightly.
2271;this film was written and produced by William Peter Blatty, based upon his best.
2272;This film was also widely acclaimed by film goers and film critics, alike.
2273;the film story is basicaslly simple .
2274;i have always loved watching THE EXORCIST and to my surprise in 2000, THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN was released theatrically in September of that year, with 11 minutes of extra footage and I was quite impressed after watching this film.
2275;i really enjoyed THE EXORCIST .
2276;"I am veryglad that the ""Williams"", made the right move by releasing this film, again, to the masses."
2277;This film will leave you possessed.
2278;After all these years it's still one of the scariest most shocking movies of all time.
2279;This one and Last House On The Left I had to sneak to see as a kid and boy was I in for a big suprise.
2280;An now as an adult I rank it up there as one of the scariest horor movie classics of all time.
2281;Max von Sydow is great in this movie.
2282;Not only a classic because it will last forever as being the scariest movie ever.
2283;I finally got to see this masterpiece, you see i first saw Exorcist the beginning which is just as good in my opinion, and i liked it alot so i wanted to see the original.
2284;They both have smart stories that are well done, they both are shocking and scary throughout, they both are dramatic, they both have outstanding performances, and they are both true masterpieces.
2285;I give them both a 9 out of a 10, if you have a brain and a good eye for great cinema you can easily see they are both amazing and should not be missed.
2286;Go see a real horror film with real atmosphere.
2287;For real Scares see a Dario Argento directed movie or just see Henry: Portait of a Serial Killer both are superb in atmosphere and suspension of disblief.
2288;It stands up to the test of time very well and sets a standard for a much maligned genre.
2289;The story of a possessed child and the exercise to roust the devil from within is actually done with a bit of class.
2290;Although I have seen the movie several years ago, last week when I saw the movie at midnight, it was still so eerie and made me tremble so much.
2291;But I still wonder how excellent this movie was, and it was never out of date.
2292;I appreciate it's classic scenes, the spider.
2293;In my opinion, this movie is one of the greatest and scariest horror films ever.
2294;For those who have home theatre Hi Fi systems, the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is excellent, considering that this film is almost 30 years old.
2295;They did a very good job remastering the video and audio.
2296;"The short scene of the infamous ""Spiderwalk"" is for me the scariest footage I have ever seen in a film in all my life."
2297;I am glad that we can now enjoy this new version of this classic at home and at night.
2298;This is one of those rare films that captures the essence of the book.
2299;It features make it what is.
2300;The Exorcist (the original) is one of the scariest movies ever produced.
2301;It's as scary today as when I watched it all those years ago.
2302;A good depiction of how evil works, insinuating itself into seemingly innocent places and sometimes hard to believe.
2303;The characters are believable and develop through the story.
2304;This is a 5 star movie, but the issue here is the added scenes.
2305;I was curious, being a fan of the original, but I can't help but feel the original cuts were justified.
2306;More dicy is the flashing of Father Merrin's face at the window before Karras jumps, which adds a spritual clarity where ambiguity has long been the established tone for the film.
2307;This is one of my favorite movies, and the Blu Ray picture is gorgeous and it comes with both the 73 original release and the Director's cut.
2308;It is also loaded with great behind the scenes footage that teaches literally how the whole movie was made which is great for filmmajors like me.
2309;Not only that there are documentaries that are fascinating too.
2310;If anyone really believes this stuff happens, well that is up to the viewer, not to mention the ideas of Roman Catholicism.
2311;Definitely, 2000's medical procedures have improved in 33 years!
2312;The special effects are excellent, if you don't mind some rather disgusting bodily excretions!
2313;Also some interesting Georgetown,DC scenes.
2314;Worth a look if you can hold your nose, and forget reality for about 90 minutes!
2315;I do however, find that it is a good suspense building film with a lot of excitement that inspires wonder and curiosity as to whether or not a real spiritual world exists.
2316;The very best of the slasher films with all their bloody shocks and thrills never remotely approach the much deeper layer of profoundly disturbing, soul scorching horror that The Exorcist masterfully conveys.
2317;"For decades this film has easily topped the vast majority of ""greatest horror movies of all time"" lists."
2318;It is fun to watch movies that are scary, but have some comical or entertaining moments.
2319;I'm a Catholic, and I have read in the Bible that this has happened.
2320;Horror movie fans should absolutely have this one in their collection.
2321;That much and the fact that Friedkin's direction was impeccable adds to the charm of this timeless masterpiece.
2322;They have the stocks so it should be pretty easy.
2323;amazon executives, I deeply trusted you until now.
2324;constructed and thoughtful movie it is.
2325;A story about grace and hope, and an important movie.
2326;The best horror film ever made!
2327;It is the most sophisticated and nuanced.
2328;It will set your brain cells on fire as well as give you the heebeejeebee's.
2329;The cinematography and script for those who love film is enough to make this a classic.
2330;Its brilliant and a monument to film making.
2331;The irony in the story has to do with the split between psychology and science as opposed to faith and religion.
2332;It is by far one of the best, if not the best, horror films ever made.
2333;This is simply a wonderful film.
2334;Everybody knows about the head.
2335;one ever mentions the brilliant direction, fabulous use of sound and stunning imagery, such as in the first 12 minutes of the film.
2336;Ellen Burstyn is outstanding, and should have won the best actress Oscar in 1973 for this film rather than Glenda Jackson.
2337;There are great supporting roles from Max Von Sydow and Lee J Cobb.
2338;claims this as the greatest film of all time.
2339;Second, this movie is a cult classic.
2340;I watched this movie at a cast party, and we ended up pausing it on the face of 'the evil one.'
2341;One of the great older horror films.
2342;I watched the special features first, which helped, but this movie remains one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen.
2343;the special features are excellent, as they take you behind the scenes to show how many of the visual effects were achieved.
2344;"As the adult Linda Blair says, ""I don't think anybody knows how much I had to go through to make this movie"", referring to the contact lenses, intense make."
2345;"the extra 8 minutes or so are interesting and add a bit of filler to the story
2346;ray sound and picture and the extras make this classic even better, and if you like horror movies done well, you'd have to go far and wide to find one better than this movie, but don't watch it late at night!
2347;The Exorcist, acclaimed as the """"Scariest movie of all time."""""""
2348;The acting was good throughout.
2349;All in all, a must watch, because of it's history as an incredible horror movie, but don't expect to be actually scared!
2350;I must admit that for a 1973 film, the special effects are outstanding.
2351;Linda Blair, as young as she was, actually did a wonderful job portraying Reagan, a young girl possessed by the devil.
2352;When I finally saw it as a teenager, I laughed at the incredible special effects.
2353;Now, after watching the movie for the fifth time, I thought William Friedkin's movie was a stunning masterpiece.
2354;Probably the scariest movie ever made.
2355;released 27 years later, one of the greatest horror films of all.
2356;seen footage detracts from the original rather than adds.
2357;It's simply one of the best films around.
2358;Without a doubt, the Exorcist is the the greatest horror movie ever made.
2359;This is a must see movie for anyone who never had the opportunity to see it.
2360;This is true movie making genius unlike most of the crap that is made today.
2361;Still feels fresh and scary.
2362;I would recommend this to anyone who is younger than 35.
2363;This might've been scary back then but I laughed a few times and that's not the reaction that should happen in a horror movie.
2364;I enjoyed the omen much more, I thought that was a scarier film.
2365;Let me just say that i loved this movie.
2366;Although made 9 years before i was born, i enjoyed it greatly.
2367;aside from this though, it is a great movie.
2368;My best advice is watch it yourself and make up your own mind on it.
2369;After all, its been nearly 30 years since it was first released and for it to survive that long, it surely must be considered a classic.
2370;But since I'm here I'll give you my opinion on the whole movie.
2371;The wait is definately worth it.
2372;This movie is hands down the best horror movie ever made, period!
2373;Each time I watch it, it causes me to shudder because of the graphic evil nature of the story and the amazing realism of the movie.
2374;All I can say is if you totally want to be frightened and shook up by a movie with a tremendous storyline and great acting, watch The Exorcist!!!
2375;The remastering is perfect, the menu and all the crap on it is a full days worth of entertainment.
2376;There is so much information, that one can see how much blood sweat and tears went into every aspect of this film from start to finish.
2377;The adaptation from the book is great too.
2378;I recommend reading the book too.
2379;This is truly the scariest movie/book ever made.
2380;When I finally saw it, I thought it was a pretty good horror film, well acted, good score.
2381;but this one, while it is certainly one of the best, falls short of the excellent reviews and attention it is given.
2382;The theme is interesting .
2383;possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings .
2384;and the movie is filmed pretty well .
2385;the best of all horror films.
2386;loved it when i saw it as a kid and still creeps me out.
2387;Now, without a doubt, The Exorcist is one of the greatest horror films ever made.
2388;I find this to be one of the finest the genre has to offer, but I'm not so sure about the new version.
2389;Well, like I said, I could deal with the extra dialogue, spooky phantom flashes and the hint of CGI, but that spider walk has just got to go.
2390;This is the best film ever produced.
2391;upEVERYONE involved with this project, including those NOT involved with the score, are to be credited for placing such a superbly acted/crafted film into history.
2392;William Peter Blatty's novel was the screenplay for this superb film.
2393;5 STARS to this exquisite film.
2394;I was a junior in high school, and a few weeks previous, my super liberal literature teacher had screened footage of the film in our creative writing class.
2395;The week after, I saw the restored print in a packed theatre, and spent most of the time viewing the film from behind my fingers, while gradually sinking lower and lower in my seat.
2396;It is one of the most disturbing experiences that I ever endured at a movie theatre.
2397;The story of Reagan, a 13 year old girl whose body is possessed by the Devil himself after playfully tampering with a Ouija board, is still a powerhouse of the horror genre.
2398;the film caused quite a stir upon its initial release.
2399;There are moments that are definitely repellant, and the obscenities which spew from young Reagan's mouth are undeniably shocking.
2400;It is an exploration of faith, of the triumph of good over evil, and a film that embraces the existence, as well as the power, of God.
2401;who both claim to be devout believers, as they stand behind the film's timeless message.
2402;technically and artistically, the film is a marvel.
2403;Linda Blair is fantastic as the young victim of possession.
2404;Her performance is extremely physical and emotional, and must have been difficult.
2405;Ellen Burstyn is perfect as usual, and is the emotional core of the film.
2406;Both Jason Miller and the great Max Von Sydow are compelling as the two priests.
2407;William Friedkin's direction is taut, and you can detect shades of Bergman here and there.
2408;notch, and the dialogue is sharp.
2409;if anything, the film causes the individuals who see it to confront their faith, and as a result, it should be praised.
2410;'The Exorcist' is rated R, and is definitely for mature audiences.
2411;ray DiscsDigibookThe Exorcist's iconic cover claims that it's the scariest film of all time, but the makers of the movie prefer to label it as a theological thriller.
2412;I mention those three because they represent the best that 'horror' has to offer, whether you label them as such or not.
2413;In those terms, The Exorcist deserves to be rated among the best 'horror' films ever made.
2414;regan is a pretty, playful 12.
2415;Regan's sweet nature gradually erodes and we see her lose her temper more and more frequently.
2416;She's eventually referred to doctors and shouts obscenities at them.
2417;Denial is a powerful thing in this story as doctors continually try to rationalize the things they are seeing and hearing.
2418;If you allow yourself to be drawn in to the story and consider how you would react if your own child underwent such changes, you'll feel the power of this film.
2419;A model was made to enable the illusion that her head turns 360 degrees.
2420;Visually, it's nothing compared to effects achieved by modern techniques.
2421;The acting is strong throughout, with the whole cast performing well.
2422;Friedkin tells the story simply, but effectively.
2423;The final solution is extreme, but convincing.
2424;like Psycho, this film was original and startling in its day.
2425;It has an important place in film history.
2426;It's certainly a strong presentation and the film benefits most of all from the audio upgrade.
2427;Dialogue is always easy to understand and some of the louder scenes, such as furniture moving or glass breaking, carry added weight.
2428;special Features 4.5/5:There's plenty of background information included in the special features for anyone who is interested.
2429;page booklet with pictures, cast details and background informationThe Exorcist is an important part of cinematic history.
2430;Nominated for 10 Oscars, it won two, and that's unusual for this genre.
2431;The audio upgrade is huge, making the experience a lot more intense.
2432;The visual upgrade is probably the best that could have been managed considering the dark setting and the director's original intentions.
2433;I would strongly recommend this definitive version for any fan of the film or of cinema in general.
2434;I still consider The Exorcist the most influential movie I have ever seen as it had me question, as those involved intended, what it is that I believe.
2435;i viewed The Exorcist on its re.
2436;In addition, I bought many scientific books as well to see what they had to say on certain religious themes.
2437;I am thankful for such an influential film as The Exorcist which began a five year journey for me to discover what I believe in.
2438;The very fact that after 30 years this film still has the power to move us speaks volumes to its importance and influence.
2439;Classic film with a few nice, extra scenes that enhance it.
2440;Still scary after all of these years.
2441;Good picture and sound, great price.
2442;"William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"" is a landmark."
2443;It is a masterpiece that will continue to endure long after many horror films of today are forgotten.
2444;While Linda Blair deservedly receives much of the attention for her fine work, the equally powerful performance by Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked.
2445;He gives the film an important human component that keeps it grounded.
2446;"Truly groundbreaking, ""The Exorcist"" is a stunning work that dared to test the limits of filmmaking."
2447;and funny at the same time.
2448;Warner did a wonderful job restoring this film .
2449;the image and sound are stunning.
2450;The soundtrack is unsettling throughout the film underscoring the nervous nature of all the characters.
2451;Most frightening is how accessible a battle between good and evil can be: right in anyone's bedroom .
2452;Turn down those lights and enjoy.
2453;Oh yeah, a word to those who challange this film to scare and say things like at the end, I laughed!
2454;The Exorcist is my favorite scary movie, although I think it's more of a disturbing one.
2455;What's scary about this film is the story.
2456;They are real, unforgettable, and thought.
2457;This, to me, is her best role in a movie ever.
2458;released Director's Cut in theaters, but I perfer to see the original 1973 film.
2459;The documentary on the 25th anniversary of this movie is fascinating, as well as the terrifying theatrical trailers.
2460;This is a must for any serious fan of horror films.
2461;Still a great film and will still scare you to death even after 25yrs.
2462;The acting is terrific and just exceptionally entertaining.
2463;I definitely recommend this movie!
2464;So hubby bought this movie for me.
2465;It is interesting to watch in the beginning.
2466;I wish I got the chance to watch the original version.
2467;Great job on this version.
2468;Some parts I admitt were entertaining
2469;worth it package of the best film of all time.
2470;Awesome remaster of the scariest film of all time!
2471;This is such a good movie, I loved it !
2472;After watching it I can for sure say that it is a classic and worth all praise it gets.
2473;I remember watching scenes from this movie when i was around 9 years old and closing my eyes really tight and plugging my ears.
2474;We're adults now and it's a bit funny thinking back on it, but this film is one of my brothers favorites .
2475;He still gets a kick out of it, although it was a good laugh for everyone.
2476;This movie will keep scaring you many times over.
2477;What once seemed to be exploitation now fits comfortably into the overall narrative.
2478;i feel that The Exorcist is as faithful to the novel as can be expected in a cinematic adaptation, and the acting and direction elevates it well above most of the subsequent entries to the genre.
2479;I enjoyed the inclusion in this version of previously deleted scenes, most of which add depth to the storyline without interrupting its flow.
2480;The new ending certainly changes the way the viewer is left to feel about the film, and some may object that this lessens its overall impact.
2481;I can only say that I found the new ending to be an appropriate and enjoyable change that did not diminish my experience in any way.
2482;The other twenty percent of Friedkin's input is interesting, if just a bit lightweight.
2483;He does mangage to convey his sincere intentions in making this film, and his affection for the project and the people involved in its creation.
2484;For those who are light hearted or don't take the subject matter seriously, it will still make your head spin.
2485;The Exorcist touches parts of the psyche that challenge religious faith, and make mental stamina a very personal issue.
2486;Upon opening their eyes, they discovered (to their great relief) a family of moose.
2487;His beautiful wife eventually filed for divorce.
2488;This true life example illustrates the dramatic impact The Exorcist can have on certain fragile personalities.
2489;got to see the version i never seen.
2490;good to see some of the interesting clips that hit the cutting floor, actually helped me understand the movie better,
2491;This was a spur of the moment pick but we enjoyed this classic!
2492;the makeup and overall goreyness of regan's face scares you and she provides constant shocks3.
2493;"Highly regarded by critics and fans as the best thriller ever made, ""The Exorcist"" tells of a true story in which a 12 year old girl is possessed by satan."
2494;The movie is also one of the best movies ever made, with amazing performances by all the leads, especially Ellen Burstyn who plays the mother, and Linda Blair who plays the little girl.
2495;The movie also won 2 Oscars, one for sound and the other for the screenplay.
2496;The movie is about the forces of good and evil in the world and the eventual outcome of that battle.
2497;If you can find that edition grab it as the documentary is informative and interesting.
2498;"also, Ellen Burstyn's autobiography called ""Lessons In Becoming Myself"" is a wonderful read and she goes into detail on how she got the role of Chris McNeil and the trouble the cast and crew found themselves in while making it."
2499;Then I encouraged her to read the book which was also excellent!
2500;one of the best horror flicks of all time.
2501;One of the best horror movies ever made.
2502;I have a VHS tape of this movie and I wanted to upgrade because I love this movie.
2503;After all these years and so much competition in the horror movie category,The Exorcist is one of the most entertaining.
2504;This film is even better than.
2505;a recommended film for those who are craving a good scare.
2506;You will always remember this movie because it will always comes back to haunt you.
2507;It is great to watch it every so many years!
2508;Although imitated many times, it still remains a one of a kind film.
2509;Can anyone name a single film, other than The Exorcist, that was aimed for a mature audience, giving us an intelligent presentation, all the while bombarding us with shocks and gore at a level that's rarely been reached in cinema.
2510;"It's amazing that a film that ""didn't scare them"" gets the most deep conversations going."
2511;From what I've observed about recent horror films, I truly believe these young people's kids and grandkids will be admiring the The Exorcist when their time comes.
2512;"I prefer the original version, but the ""new"" version is also great."
2513;Ellen Burstyn is Chris MacNeil, a successful actress living in a swanky house in Washington, D. c. with her 12 year old daughter Reagan (Linda Blair).
2514;They have the perfect mother/daughter relationship, and everything is hunky dory until one evening when Chris throws a party for a group of her friends.
2515;It pressed spiritual buttons and made some people ponder the validity and depth of their own faith.
2516;Director William Friedkin does wonders as he brings to life William Peter Blatty's novel and extracts solid performances from Burstyn, as well as Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller as Father Merrin and Father Karras respectively.
2517;released with additional footage and special effects, and while they don't hurt the movie, they do take away some of its effectiveness and dramatic subtlety.
2518;The version to get is the 25th Anniversary edition, which has the movie in its pure and original form, as well as an excellent documentary with interviews from the cast and filmmakers.
2519;i saw this version in the theatres when it was released and still enjoyed it.
2520;this is still the greatest horror film ever made.
2521;The film builds and builds to its shocking conclusion.
2522;As powerful today as it was 40 years ago.
2523;"I bought this ""classic"" expecting to be at least mildly frightened."
2524;The Exorcist is by far the most frightening film ever made .
2525;To watch every facial movement and reaction of Linda Blair's performance is incredible.
2526;They IMMEDIATELY sent out a new one that worked perfectly.
2527;Kudos to them for great service.
2528;Well, this is the extended version of the Exorcist and having seen this and the theatrical version I have to recommend going with this one.
2529;Though it only has ten mintues of extra footage, the additional scenes are worth it.
2530;I strongly recommend seeing Exorcist Beginning before watching this.
2531;I suppose a true exorcist fan would have both though I prefer the extra footage over the bonus features.
2532;If you find films about demonic possession entertaining, the Exorcist is recommended.
2533;Excellent cinematography, production, direction, script, and acting.
2534;I actually wanted to leave right in the middle of it, but my friends held me back.
2535;It did inspire a really cool Angel episode.
2536;by the way, I know I am committing horror movie blasphemy here but I really liked the sequel with George C. Scott and Brad Douriff as the demon.
2537;I still say Linda Blair should have won an Academy Award for her performance here.
2538;First, the flashes of demon faces is a brilliant touch and manages to make you feel quite uneasy.
2539;The infamous spider walk scene truly takes you off guard the first time you see it.
2540;exorcist is one of the greatest horror movies, not because of how scary it is, but simply because its a good movie.
2541;so worth it if u want a scary movie night but sleep with a light on!!!!!
2542;An enjoyable but still scary movie to watch after all these years.
2543;I am from a generation that remembers this movie as one of the all time greatest scares, so it brought back a whole thriller feeling of being scared.
2544;The Exorcist is one of the most infamous and well known horror films ever made.
2545;She's portrayed at first as a normal, innocent girl.
2546;Her age leads me to believe that Regan's budding sexuality is being repressed through this story of possession.
2547;The goal of the film is to transform Regan back into her pure, virginal state to reinstate the status quo.
2548;even Regan's mother, who seems strong and successful, is undermined through the course of the film.
2549;At the beginning of the film, she is a world famous actress who successful raised her child on her own.
2550;despite my misogynistic interpretation of the film, I did enjoy the film.
2551;The acting is impeccable from the entire cast, but especially in Linda Blair as Regan.
2552;The effects are amazing and don't lose much of their effect even today.
2553;The director and actors went to great lengths and were even injured on the set in order to create real emotional responses and realistic supernatural effects.
2554;The musical score is made up of eerie modern classical music by Penderecki and portions of George Crumb's string quartet Black Angels.
2555;Either way, it's a very well.
2556;known and often times feared film that will live on in infamy.
2557;Great movie, one of the best horror movies ever done.
2558;This movie still scares people to this day!
2559;Well written, acted, and the special effects were ahead of its time.
2560;Worth having in your movie collection.
2561;It keeps you glued to the screen and wanting to know what will happen next.
2562;The Exorcist is certainly a scary movie, with its unforgettable images of a girl possessed by the fury and its accompanying special effects.
2563;Visually, this movie leaves a lasting impression.
2564;Musically, it's powerful and dramatic, and psychologically, well, that's what this movie is all about.
2565;This movie is a must.
2566;There is frightening directing by William Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION), a very short by haunting score by Jack Nitzsche, and great performances by Burstyn, Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow.
2567;made thriller that has somehow managed to tap into the collective unconscious in a way that few movies ever have.
2568;still, there are a couple of good jolts, though.
2569;This is the original version of the film that appeared in theaters, and in my opinion the best, as the directors cut has all the things in it that the director originally felt.
2570;it's a classic film, not just for it's horrific scenes, but because it's a perfect storm of a movie.
2571;great script, superior casting, ace cinematography and editing, and amazing sound.
2572;jason Miller, in his first movie role, is particularly engrossing as a troubled priest, and Ellen Burstyn is believable and effective as the tortured mother of Regan.
2573;It truly is a classic.
2574;It's a mind blowing scary film.
2575;Wow is all I can say.
2576;A beautiful, loving young girl is turned into a horrific monster by a deamon that posseses her.
2577;raising story with amazing special effects.
2578;the best film ever made it has every thing a good movie needs a absoululty scary plot a brilliant screenplay an expert director and brilliant acting.
2579;it still scares me and thats after seeing it six times.
2580;Although some are worth viewing.
2581;turn out the lights, 'watch on a stormy night, if possible,' sit back and enjoy this great movie.
2582;Steam emitted from characters mouths, making it genuine.
2583;With an estimated budget of $10,497,444, Director William Friedkin mortified and disturbed teens and adults so severely that The Exorcist is known as the scariest movie ever made.
2584;"The opening scene of the movie takes place in Iraq at an archaeological site where Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) is working
2585;Regans Mother is an actress"
2586;Chris takes her to the doctor where they believe that she just needs to take a medication, Adderall, and she will soon be better.
2587;The possession really takes hold of Regan after the scans.
2588;although The Exorcist was released in 1973, it displays excellent use of special effects.
2589;Music played always matches the type of scene.
2590;For example, suspenseful music is played during suspenseful scenes.
2591;The iconic Exorcist theme song, Tubular Bells, is played right before some of the strange things with Regan happen while Chris is walking home.
2592;Another interesting use of sound is the many voices that Regan has when she is possessed.
2593;"She takes on the voice of the demon (Mercedes McCambridge) as well as some other voices, one of which is the voice of Father Damians Mother (Vasiliki Maliaros)
2594;The sun would always be very bright yellow on a very red sky.
2595;the makeup used is very convincing.
2596;There wasnt any makeup that wasnt perfectly executed.
2597;the actors in The Exorcist performed very well.
2598;Everyone does an excellent job expressing the emotions that you imagine someone would feel in the situation that they are in.
2599;I am especially impressed with Linda Blairs performance, she was very young when she portrayed the possessed main character of this movie, she had to take on multiple personalities for her character and she did so flawlessly.
2600;some people may argue that The Exorcist isnt really the scariest movie ever made or that it really isnt as good as I think it is"
2601;When I see The Exorcist I see amazing effects for its time and an incredibly scary movie psychologically.
2602;Of all the horror movies that have been made, The Exorcist has to be one of the most classic and most compelling of them all.
2603;This is one of the greatest horror movies ever.
2604;This is always my go to thriller.
2605;I watch a couple of times a year.
2606;It is a classic of it's era!!!
2607;Great movie still holds up to one of the best horror movies ever.
2608;In an era when many movies compete to scare the devil out of you, The Exorcist remains one of the few able to successfully scare the devil into you.
2609;This is one of the great horror movies.
2610;the end result is a film that feels much longer and slower but still eventually grips.
2611;Aside from the overlength, the strengths and weaknesses are much the same: the at times almost documentary style of film.
2612;few extras, but the widescreen transfer is good.
2613;I have seen this movie and all its sequel and none of them are as frightning are as good as this.
2614;the movie is known as the scarest movie of all time for sure and the new 11 minutes are great and a very intense scene with regan walking down the stairs backwards.
2615;the picture is clear and the sound is excellent but the special freatures are slim with only 2 trailers, 4 T. v. previews and a director commentary but I found the main menu had errie music.
2616;all in all the movies great but the special features are slim.
2617;This is about a riveting supernatural experience that is full of suspense with a corresponding ominous build up.
2618;Simply a classic, basically in a realm of its own.
2619;was the exorcism successful or not?Still gives shivers.
2620;i will admit that the acting is done well and some of the special effects are pretty cool.
2621;i saw it in the theaters like 2 years ago i went home with chills.
2622;for religious people please dont see this.
2623;i thought the spider wlak was great.
2624;this is with out a doubt the best horror movie!
2625;The new transfer of The Exorcist kept me awe.
2626;struck through the whole thing, a showcase of brilliant clarity and detail that no generation has ever been able to experience at home.
2627;Also, it's great to see that it includes both the original theatrical edition and extended director's cut.
2628;Blu Ray gives this nearly 40 year old movie a glossy, young look that is just as stunning in appearance as any recent blockbuster.
2629;I will say, however, that if you really want to experience the complexity and brilliance of the story in its full glory, you should look into reading William Peter Blatty'soriginal book.
2630;This is a classic, scary horror movie.
2631;The film is, of course, a classic.
2632;I sneaked into a theatre when this flick was re.
2633;I remember watching this movie from in between my fingers and being absolutely scared silly but riveted to my seat by my fright,man did I reget seeing that movie.
2634;It is scary, funny, and based on true life which shocked me.
2635;So maybe it is not the scariest film of all time, but it defintitely comes close!The acting is superb and terrific.
2636;For those who love thrills and chills, this is a true classic.
2637;Its more the way the story slowly creeps into your mind and grows strong in its horrifying way.
2638;So what is it about The Exorcist that not just gives us the chills, but literally tears into our bodies and minds and threatens the well.
2639;It is a humbling experience for both the characters and the audience.
2640;obscenities are enhanced, and the infamous spider.
2641;walk (they hired a contortionist) is added to satisfy the moviegoers whose motivation is to enjoy the sheer horror.
2642;It is good to know that it is not jacked.
2643;overall, a very well done revision of the original film, (writer William Peter Blatty said that he had been waiting for this version to be released for over 25 years) and a fantastic and beautiful story about faith, while exploring serious and important concepts of this age.
2644;"For true fans of this magnificent film, it is necessary to own both the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" and ""The Version You've Never Seen""."
2645;They did a great job remastering the picture and sound.
2646;ray version at a friends house, and I thought it was fantastic.
2647;Easily one of, if not the best horror movie of all time.
2648;The special edition here is worth it, if only for the brief shot of Regan's staircase decent, and if you are a freak like me and actually watch this repeatedly.
2649;And as well as the off shots during the possession (beside the door, look close, there it is).
2650;Saw the movie when it first came out in 1973 and watching it again was a exciting and scary as the first time I saw it.
2651;The movie stands the test of time as a classic.
2652;A masterpiece, though the first act runs too long.
2653;It's a powerful film that still resonates due to brilliant performances by everyone (particularly a young Linda Blair and the late playwright Jason Miller who gives a vunerable performance in his debut).
2654;"While exploitation horror flicks have always been around, director William Friedkin (""The French Connection"", ""Sorceror"", ""Cruising"", ""To Live and Die in L. a."") and writer/producer William Peter Blatty tucked elements of those films into a film examining the issues of faith, science and the cost of redemption with ""The Exorcist""."
2655;"ray gives us both the original theatrical cut and the 2000 ""Extended Director's Cut"" that Friedkin reworked adding in a couple of scenes, shuffling the order of a few scenes and editing out a few others in his pursuit of perfection."
2656;As to which you prefer, that'll be your call.
2657;"As much as I enjoy the addition of the show stopping ""spider walk"" sequence (and it does, indeed, stop the movie cold as the screen briefly goes to black)and some of the editing/digital tricks up Friedkin's sleeve, the original film resonates more for me and allows our imagination and the psychological terror a bit more free rein."
2658;the sound is marvelous throughout with a 5.1 mix that adds a wallop to the impact of the film.
2659;scenes and production stills as well as a one sheet with thoughts on the film by the director.
2660;warner has done a fine job of transferring the film to Blu.
2661;ray (although some may quibble a bit with the choices by Friedkin and his DP in regards to color saturation.
2662;"is ""The Exorcist"" the scariest film ever made?"
2663;"friedkin and Blatty managed to make a horror film that touched on our deepest, darkest fears AND also managed to deal with a number of major themes all while giving us complex, interesting characters an accomplishment that very few directors have managed when creating a horror film (Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" also does much the same thing) that is psychologically claustrophobic."
2664;I've seen this movie hundreds of times, and I still get a jolt out of it.
2665;Powerful acting by a perfect cast, deeply moving subject matter, and more psychological scares than onscreen gore make this movie stand out as one of the greatest of all time.
2666;turn out the lights for best results.
2667;The years went by and I decided to give it another look and I actually found myself enjoying it much more than my first viewing in the theater.
2668;It's still not a great work by any means, but it beats many movies being made today.
2669;And when it's viewed that way, it is still quite an enjoyable piece of entertainment.
2670;The acting is decent and there's actually some good character development and something like a plot.
2671;all, The Exorcist has earned and deserved it's classic status quite well.
2672;The scariest part of this movie is that it is based on reality, unlike many scary movies which are impossible in real.
2673;This film is based on a real supernatural condition.
2674;fest, I figure I'll end this countdown with one of the absolute most well.
2675;, this movie nevertheless has the power and terror that basically defines the horror movie genre.
2676;I don't want to dwindle on this part too much, but also regarding that I'm Roman Catholic, this movie definitely hits home with me.
2677;Starting the movie like this is an interesting idea, and a concept that hasn't been done too much by other movies, even though it works here.
2678;The acting throughout is phenomenal, alongside the special effects, which goes without saying.
2679;As dark and terrifying as this movie is, it most certainly still packs a brilliance, alongside talented writing and directing that makes it worth the watch.
2680;"in short, ""The Exorcist"" is a film that's just as horrifying as it is both groundbreaking and vastly interesting."
2681;Such a movie deserves to go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and considering I'm a guy who's seen countless horror movies, I agree with that statement.
2682;stirring movie yet, this is very highly recommended.
2683;Thanks for the time, and peace.
2684;Greatest horror movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2685;full of special features, and beautifully transferred in anamorphic 16:9.
2686;A real treat is the included BBC documentary The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist, which contains a wealth of information on the genesis of one of the truly great films of the 70's.
2687;and presents it as honestly as possible.
2688;It understands the nature of faith.
2689;And like the rest of us, their faith is sometimes severely tested.
2690;He is a modern Jesuit .
2691;trained to believe that good science and good religion are not contradictory.
2692;more so even than Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist towers as an example of the legitimacy of the horror genre as potentially great cinema, not merely a great thrill ride.
2693;The Exorcist's biggest strength and what makes it such a great film is in how seriously it takes its subject.
2694;the filmmakers are more interested in giving us real characters, drawn from real life people rather than from other films.
2695;It is very easy to sympathize with them.
2696;the movie is technically brilliant too.
2697;The camera work, the lighting, the sound are all superb.
2698;The script is beautifully written by WP Blatty.
2699;the Exorcist is no doubt the scariest film ever made for the simple fact that it takes its subject as seriously as Spielberg treated the Holocaust in Schindler's List.
2700;This is powerful, exciting, and brilliant filmmaking.
2701;This movie was actually based on a best.
2702;"I don't exactly know what the scariest movie of all time actually is
2703;By early 1970s standards """"The Exorcist"""" IS a technical masterpiece, and established a benchmark for horror movies well after the film's theatrical run."""
2704;it's amazing to get this collection .
2705;very scary look this movie .
2706;great transfer with a luxury edition make me happy.
2707;this is still the scariest movie i've ever seen ,when i fist seen it year's ago, i had nightmare's!
2708;it's amazing what the devil can do to someone!
2709;the reason it is so scary is that it hits right near home.
2710;it asks the real questions.
2711;The Exorcist succeeds on every level.
2712;This film should have swept the Oscars.
2713;The acting, and direction was beyond top rate, William Freidkin coaxed masterful performances from all of his actors.
2714;This film chilled audiences in the 70's to the bone, and I can see why.
2715;Freidkin uses subliminal images, and horrifying make up to tell a tale of demonic possession that strikes a raw nerve.
2716;I was very terrified when i watched the movie and it really imperssed me with it's filming and and production.
2717;I have seen it's documentery,and compering it with the film, very fascinating.
2718;It is a movie that brought up a true story of the unixpected.
2719;this movie will be remembered as one of the scariest of all time.
2720;Though its not that scary (at least in my opinion), it _will_ be remembered as a classic and is definetly worth your time and money.
2721;ray makes it seem like it is happening right now, all over again.
2722;but none of that gets in the way of a great story and awesome acting!
