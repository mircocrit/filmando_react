I:885;1;This 1998 movie starring Keifer Sutherland, Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Conelly and some other people I don't remember is a great movie.
I:885;2;It is one of those movies you see where you need to watch it with an open mind.
I:885;3;Because that is the best way to enjoy it.
I:885;4;It might be hard to grasp for some but for fans of Science Fiction movies this movie is one of the best Sci Fi movies in recent memory.
I:885;5;Also if you are expecting action galore, then you are in for a suprise because there is very little action but the plot is very rich.
I:885;6;I know it has a decent following but I find it to be very underrated and I think it will be a greater cult classic in time.
I:885;7;I bought this title based solely on reviews here, and had to remark how much I loved it.
I:885;8;i loved how it was filmed, and will test the black level ability of any TV.
I:885;9;It even looked amazing on my 480p plasma.
I:885;10;last, but definitely not least, the audio was amazing.
I:885;11;It is detailed, complex, and will rock your house down.
I:885;12;a real triumph, and I can't believe I just watched a movie that came out in 1998.
I:885;13;It could have come out yesterday and it would still be heralded as great.
I:885;14;Will keep you spell bound like THE MATRIX for days after the film is over.
I:885;15;I remember waffling something fierce on whether to see this movie.
I:885;16;I rather enjoy seeing things that you don't normally run across.
I:885;17;i was captivated by the scenery instantly as well as the quirk of the characters.
I:885;18;Still, I have to give this movie 5 stars, just for the intense feeling of WOW!
I:885;19;"He has to question everything he's ever known
I:885;20;There are great sets and good cinematography coupled with a compelling storyline.
I:885;21;The movie is a psychological thriller .
I:885;22;about what happens in one's mind, and to this end it's not necessary to develop deep characters, the plot is what's being showcased and it does a great job at that.
I:885;23;If you're one who has thought that there must be more to the game than what's presented, on *any* level you'll enjoy this movie.
I:885;24;and the subtlety with which it is attempting to do it.
I:885;25;it is the whole idea of finding one's soul, being true to it, and fighting to keep its integrity against the demonic forces and effects of the world around it.
I:885;26;a beautifully poetic and highly symbolic (with secret symbols) allegory.
I:885;27;an allegory is a double layered work in which one level seems to be the surface level of the literal story, but the other level is inviting you.
I:885;28;psychological, spiritual, philosophical, hidden knowledge levels.
I:885;29;but rather, nobly enlightening and spiritually stengthening poetry.
I:885;30;which is psychologically and spiritually profound.
I:885;31;so that they wake up in new identities and new circumstances .
I:885;32;and the ending where the hero, by using the power of his mind and will, is able to raise the symbolic lighthouse from the sea.
I:885;33;what do you think that brilliant sunlight.
I:885;34;and that wondrous, profoundly moving music mean.
I:885;35;knowledge and the light?And what is the meaning of his extraordinary focus and mind power?
I:885;36;that Shell Beach (in Dark City ) and New Zion (in The Matrix ) cannot be achieved until the hero believes in himself, takes on his responsibiity, and starts to set things right.
I:885;37;to face the wondrous light of Truth.
I:885;38;and in one of the most beautiful and moving scenes in film, John's love.
I:885;39;heartening to hear people talking of The Matrix .
I:885;40;the deeper, hidden message flew right by them.
I:885;41;Despite the hype that came in the packaging, this is a work of art.
I:885;42;Dark City does all of this well, drawing on those same assumptions of reality we all have to create the tension that makes the message all the more striking.
I:885;43;As a cinematic creation, this is a work that deserves study, paying tribute to all that came before and deriving a new genre as a result.
I:885;44;For those of us who are fans of Bogart, the Black Dahlia, British depression, Hellraiser, and Roger Rabbit, this is the culmination of all of our obsessions.
I:885;45;maybe because it defies easy genre classification.
I:885;46;however Dark City is a very compelling film with a terrific premise and a well plotted story.
I:885;47;the effects in this film are universally impressive, but what's more, refreshingly integral to the story.
I:885;48;Both the sound and the picture are fantastic.
I:885;49;For example, the Comparisons to Metropolis feature is a wonderful idea, but is executed here with about as much thought as goes onto the back of a cereal carton.
I:885;50;of the two alternate voice tracks, Roger Ebert's is actually the more insightful.
I:885;51;You realize pretty quickly that the director, writers, production designers, and photographer recorded their comments separately.
I:885;52;A brilliant film from Alex Proyas, that expertly mixes noir, science fiction and themes of existentialism.
I:885;53;A lot has been written about this great film (go read Ebert), so I won't repeat.
I:885;54;* The disc will carry both the theatrical and director's cuts of the film .
I:885;55;This was more of a 3.5 star movie but I rounded up.
I:885;56;True, it is a beautiful looking film.
I:885;57;I disagree this film is a send up of my favorite genre of cinema.
I:885;58;IF you truly love film noir every in.
I:885;59;joke in this film you will catch and the city inside a city idea is brilliant and the Matrix owes it's box office to that fact.
I:885;60;And I love the look of this film, which comes across great on Blu.
I:885;61;If you haven't seen this movie before, here's an excellent opportunity to know it.
I:885;62;fi movie, and I think this is really what makes it unique in the genre.
I:885;63;The first time that I saw this picture, I was very entertained, yet somewhat disoriented.
I:885;64;the second time that I saw this film, I picked up on things that I had initially missed, and enjoyed myself thoroughly.
I:885;65;he named DARK CITY the best picture of 1998.
I:885;66;It's very interesting to listen to.
I:885;67;Whatever, the film features a terrific supporting performance by William Hurt as the detective and a creepy Kiefer Sutherland performance to good effect.
I:885;68;At any rate, it's a classic of escapist sci.
I:885;69;That we can change the world to fit our own desires, which are to the benefit of the entire world would be a goal that anybody would have.
I:885;70;I believe Dark City to still be one of the greatest sci.
I:885;71;fi movies around, and despite having seen it innumerable times, I still find new ideas and concepts emerging from the rich material.
I:885;72;ray editionDark City (Director's Cut) [Blu.
I:885;73;Somebody must have realized that the potency of a good cerebral thriller largely consists of its ability to tease, to keep the viewer constantly on edge, guessing.
I:885;74;the best and most entertaining aspect of Dark City is the art direction.
I:885;75;There are a few good ideas, such as John's recurring attempts to find his way to Shell Beach, a resort spot everyone seems to love but doesn't know the way to.
I:885;76;If you like 'Matrix' then this will be a movie you treasure because it is the first, the true one.
I:885;77;this movie is so fantastic.
I:885;78;all of the actors are great.
I:885;79;eyed and strong with ease.
I:885;80;The extras as a whole are pretty good the commentary from Roger Ebert is odd but as a movie enthusiast he adds a lot of intellect to a movie chockful.
I:885;81;The director and writer have a seperate commentary that is engaging and informative.
I:885;82;adding this to your collection will make you look cool.
I:885;83;It makes a good cinematic introduction to Buddhism,superior to the Buddhism/Taoism lite of Star Wars.
I:885;84;Dark City even leaves the viewer with questions,making the shiny happy ending bittersweet.
I:885;85;hearted performance from William Hurt, and the mad stuttering scientist Dr. schreber,expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland.
I:885;86;Her role is primarily to be a double agent damsel in distress.
I:885;87;however,the movie brings up intriguing ideas,especially Buddhist ones.
I:885;88;"Sutherland's character brings up reincarnation (""you have lived many lives""),that reality is an illusion,and that it's a person's responsibility to create their own world."
I:885;89;Concentration is important to all forms of Buddhism.
I:885;90;"Was he hallucinating due to his insomnia?Where were the people of the Dark City from before they were abducted?Was it all John's dream?When John reunites with his wife,is he still within the Dark City,making memories that are only an illusion?While the movie has its cheesy aspects (the Strangers floating around,having hilarious names&menacingly
I:885;91;it makes for fun viewing.
I:885;92;Dark City was an excellent film which plays on a feeling that each of us has experienced at one time or another, that feeling that we believe we lived another life.
I:885;93;Rufus Sewell as Murdock is excellent, supported by Hurt and Connelly in their respective roles.
I:885;94;Sutherland overdoes his role slightly, but is overcome by acting of Richard O'Brian as one of the Strangers.
I:885;95;This is the best sci.
I:885;96;fi film ever made and one of the greast films.
I:885;97;This is a must for the genre movie collectors.
I:885;98;An interesting movie which sparked the Matrix series of movies.
I:885;99;A must see for a unique perspective.
I:885;100;The great vision of this movie is enhanced with the Blu.
I:885;101;def and a big screen.
I:885;102;Wow, this movie is great.
I:885;103;I definitely recommend this movie for those that like thinking out of the box.
I:885;104;This is the dumbest sci.
I:885;105;what an excellent, mind bending film.
I:885;106;Director alex proyas really knows how to create futuristic visions that are not only stylized but also clever and has a lot of inner logic into them.
I:885;107;The movie is much more colorful than I remember.
I:885;108;Even though most of the movie is dark, it looks phenomenally great.
I:885;109;"All of this is on disc one
I:885;110;*The movie itself has some good action and special effects.
I:885;111;Moreover, it has a very slick and interesting tech.
I:885;112;"noir style and production design (overall, it's like a retro version of ""Blade Runner"")."
I:885;113;"*Pretty good writing
I:885;114;*Kind of slow at parts (but if you like the style, it'll be interesting all the way through).
I:885;115;I specifically wanted the director's cut because it, unlike the theatrical release, contains Jennifer Connelly's actual (and gorgeous) singing voice.
I:885;116;Dark City is one of my most favorite films.
I:885;117;And includes both the director's and theatrical cuts!I had to watch the film many times to truly understand it.
I:885;118;memorable scenes for me: the beginning scene along with the main titles sequence, The Strangers arriving to get John who escapes, Mr. Hand questioning the whereabouts of John before putting the man to sleep, John's first encounter and fight with The Strangers with saw Mr. Quick's death, Mr. Hand and the doctor (who is in the pool) discussing John, among other scenes.
I:885;119;The movie sucked except for the opening scene (minss Johnny Cage's death) but the Dark City trailer, which was better than the MK film itself, was well worth the price alone!
I:885;120;Beautifully brought to life by the entire cast.
I:885;121;What can I say, everything is perfect.
I:885;122;Top director, superb camera work, great lighting, good actors.
I:885;123;fi genre with a philosophical twist, this one is for you.
I:885;124;although the film mixes in a science fiction plot with some imagery of that genre, Above all, this film is a tribute to the classic American Film Noir style of the 40's and 50's.
I:885;125;"Turn your ""Tint"" control to the red spectrum, usually to the right to give the the classic feel."
I:885;126;Little did I know at the time that this greatly added to my enjoyment of it.
I:885;127;"This immensely reduced the ""twilight zone"" suspense and eeriness of the work."
I:885;128;Watching the mystery unfold gradually is much more enjoyable.
I:885;129;Glad I held through it.
I:885;130;story, filming and acting all first rate.
I:885;131;enhanced viewing experience on a widescreen TV.
I:885;132;William Hurt's performance is one of my favorites.
I:885;133;The film's dark atmosphere is strong and all.
I:885;134;Roger Ebert named this movie the best for 1998.
I:885;135;It's a work of art.
I:885;136;tightly made, great, fresh performances, big picture special fx, has the feel of an epic movie developed through one special character, akin to but better than Matrix.
I:885;137;Don't get me wrong now, the movie is amazing, and I wholly agree with Roger Ebert when he says that this is one of the few original sci.
I:885;138;they make it even darker in the transfer, so that most of the scenes consist of a disembodied face or faces floating on a uniformly BLACK background!
I:885;139;This movie is an engrossing rendition of the sci.
I:885;140;moreover, it exhibits the irrationality of collective minds and the like.
I:885;141;The plot is revealed well, and doesn't have too many holes in it.
I:885;142;Certain scenes when John starts to figure out what's going on are really chilling.
I:885;143;And the movie manages to have a happy ending that's not stupid!
I:885;144;And of course, the cinematography is beautiful.
I:885;145;Dark City is a far better movie.
I:885;146;It always bothered me, being one of the few discernible flaws in an otherwise masterful neo.
I:885;147;All in all, a great value for one hell of an underrated masterpiece.
I:885;148;"I saw the movie twice at the theatre when it was released back in the 20th century 
I:885;149;Plus the commentaries are instructives and the interviews very informative.
I:885;150;But I love the new director's cut that was released for the blu.
I:885;151;ray system it give a more thrilling and more mystirious look.
I:885;152;ray disc is worth getting and i promises that once you see the DC version you will not see the original again even though the original was good.
I:885;153;what a visually stunning film from a director of one of the best movies of all time, The Crow!
I:885;154;An incredible story packed with visually stunning cinematography, special effects and an original story.
I:885;155;I honestly never thought Alex Proyas would be able to top The Crow on a visual level but he certainly did, although I cannot compare The Crow to Dark City on a story based level, Dark City was more visually stunning than the crow but we also have to keep in mind when The Crow was made.
I:885;156;Don't get me wrong, The Crow is one of my favorite movies but the Dark City also deserves a lot of credit for it's originality, visual triumph, and ability to let the mind wonder away into the world of unknown during the movie.
I:885;157;i will definitely watch this movie over and over again simply because it is just that good.
I:885;158;Seeing that is came out in 1998, it still puzzles me how this movie did not become a cult classic just yet.
I:885;159;If you are a fan of Blade Runner/The Matrix/The Crow or any other movie bordering these three, you will enjoy Dark City.
I:885;160;it's the first time I watched this film since I saw it in theaters 9 years ago and it still left a huge impression on me.
I:885;161;"Just remember this
I:885;162;It is worthy of ownership so don't be afraid of ordering it from Amazon.
I:885;163;my son and I discussed many questions about this film at the end.
I:885;164;creation of Earth or is it the real Earth we now know?This film just works on so many levels that it leaves your head spinning.
I:885;165;Others have mentioned the film noir element and the movies it has influenced since its release.
I:885;166;I liked everything about this movie except for the plot, the script and the acting.
I:885;167;It's like they showed a bunch of high school kids a cool opening scene from a film.
I:885;168;The special effects are amazing!
I:885;169;The plot line is original, with no easy answers.
I:885;170;It's a mystery which reveals itself bit by bit, with many plausible answers.
I:885;171;strongly recommended for those who like dark, forbidding, intelligent sci.
I:885;172;They could have done so much more to develop the characters to their potential, and turn a good movie into a great one.
I:885;173;Nevertheless, I bought it, as an example of true imagination.
I:885;174;ing it up in movies like Mirrors.
I:885;175;and just perfect, judicious use of special effects.
I:885;176;A seamless, surreal thriller that never gives us a detail too much.
I:885;177;John Murdoch is my new hero!
I:885;178;I saw this film during its somewhat belated release in Turkey in November and was instantly struck by its great look and ideas.
I:885;179;It's a genuine fantasy classic whose real value will only be realized in the years to come.
I:885;180;This stunningly visual film pays homage to Blade Runner and foreshadows aspects of The Matrix.
I:885;181;It tells it's story vividly, innovatively and with style.
I:885;182;Those who say it's plot is derivative are right to a degree (elements of the storyline echo an early Twilight Zone episode among others), but the look and feel of the movie, coupled with superb performances, makes it all fresh.
I:885;183;this one is definitely worth owning.
I:885;184;It's almost a magical feeling.
I:885;185;Lots of action and suspense, a great sci fi thatprovokes unrest.
I:885;186;This video goes on a lot of peoples lists as unknown which is a crime if you love Sci Fy and great love stories you need to watch this movie it has a great cast script and direction this is also a great family movie I'm purposely not trying to tell you much about this movie to pique your curiosity you will not be disappointed I want you to watch it and judge for yourselves
I:885;187;I've always loved this movie, and when I saw that it was available in Blu.
I:885;188;ray I jumped at it.
I:885;189;I was interested that it contains both the director's cut and the original theatrical version, and have watched, and enjoyed, both.
I:885;190;conceptions, I prefer the theatrical version.
I:885;191;anyway, a great movie, wonderfully rendered in Blu.
I:885;192;ray, and at a great price.
I:885;193;The visuals gothic in feel and style will hold you long enough to allow you to enjoy the slow unfolding of the story.
I:885;194;Extremely well written and well acted.
I:885;195;provoking plot,always surprising and fun.
I:885;196;Suprising combination of history and future combined with science.
I:885;197;This is a brilliant story on the theme of visualisation.
I:885;198;Great allegory, great visuals (like Batman meets Terry Gilliam).
I:885;199;Nice to see some UK actors (playing baddies as usual).
I:885;200;Great entertainment, and thought provoking to boot.
I:885;201;Its hard to find a movie with an original and unique concept but this one does it.
I:885;202;More importantly, it holds an intriguing edginess throughout the movie.
I:885;203;They control everything, making the entire city sleep, so they can rearrange buildings, erect whole new cityscapes, and inject whole new lifetime memories / experiences into the minds of their subjects (the populace).
I:885;204;The ending is positive without being sappy.
I:885;205;This movie reminds me of the same city like landscape that the Matrix holds.
I:885;206;This movie is really good and the story is worth watching the movie and finding out exactly what is wrong with the town.
I:885;207;The main character is excellent at portraying his innocence when he is the one with the true power and starts unlocking deep secrets held in the most darkest places of the town.
I:885;208;Cool movie and worth the pick up!
I:885;209;First off, the visuals are spectacular.
I:885;210;There are some inventive special effects during the tuning of the city which are wonderful.
I:885;211;The opening bathroom scene was gorgeous.
I:885;212;This movie is likely to end up as one of those classics that is studied in every cinema class.
I:885;213;The story is unlike any I have seen in the movies.
I:885;214;It keeps you guessing right until the end.
I:885;215;If you look up the word underrated in the dictionary, you'll find a still from this sci.
I:885;216;fi masterpiece that nobody seems to notice.
I:885;217;If director Alex Proyas ever wanted to do a Batman movie he's got my vote .
I:885;218;Kiefer Sutherland is good as a scientist who gets roped into events beyond his ability to fight, and Jennifer Connelly.
I:885;219;That she's perhaps the most beautiful creature God ever placed on this Earth?
I:885;220;I read a lot about this movie and it seemed like the type of movie I would enjoy (I love Blade Runner and The Matrix).
I:885;221;pQ and AQ are great.
I:885;222;You will need to see this movie in a dark room so you can see all the details of the great set.
I:885;223;"viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP."
I:885;224;i'd recommend the director's cut of the movie.
I:885;225;Nightmarish figures, and likable characters portrayed by Rufus Sewell and William Hurt.
I:885;226;Give this movie a shot.
I:885;227;You may have a new favorite on your hands.
I:885;228;The confrontation between John Murdoch and Mr. Book is terrific.
I:885;229;fi, this flick is for you: it mixes all those genres.
I:885;230;on a technical level, meaning cinematography, special effects, film editing, directing, and especially acting, this film excels, is worth rewatching.
I:885;231;"The pictures look much more solid
I:885;232;Is there something deeper that we do not see?The answer, I believe, is a surprising: Yes!!
I:885;233;"Eventually all is revealed
I:885;234;once you make the true connexion.
I:885;235;"then rewatch ""Dark City"" with a fresh awe."
I:885;236;An awe that few modern movies of any genre supply.
I:885;237;one of my top ten movies of all time, this movie is breath.
I:885;238;"But if you're a newcomer, you'll need the opening narration and everything else the movie provides you because, to paraphrase Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE, ""it's going to be a bumpy ride."
I:885;239;DARK CITY is a thrilling head trip from start to finish, a tale that gives you just enough to stand upon and then every so often yanks the rug right out from under you.
I:885;240;He makes it out just in time for us to see that those who are coming for him virtually float on air.
I:885;241;THAT at least makes sense, but it's what they can DO, and how it affects the citizens of Dark City, that makes all the difference.
I:885;242;And a detective hot on his trail (William Hurt).
I:885;243;Within every film there is a moment in which society faces a monumental coming to terms with a supremely metamorphic moment.
I:885;244;And it is that which lies at the heart of this movie .
I:885;245;and that, in a nutshell, gives us our insight into this bizarre and wonderful movie.
I:885;246;one that the recently late Roger Ebert called the best film of 1998.
I:885;247;and has an even gloomier visual style than The Matrix.
I:885;248;The visuals are stunning, the acting is superb (biggest revelation, Kiefer Sutherlan CAN act) and the ending is quite satisfying.
I:885;249;If he survives what lies ahead he just might see the world as it truly is.
I:885;250;It is also a movie that elicits a strong emotional response from the audience at both ends of the spectrum.
I:885;251;Leave a light on if you must.
I:885;252;This film is a real find.
I:885;253;Its a good, solid Sci Fi.
I:885;254;The logic of the scrpt is a little fuzzy, but its a pretty nifty film.
I:885;255;Yeah, yeah, yeah, the title is Dark City but it is hard to see anything on screen at times.
I:885;256;I'll keep it short and sweet.
I:885;257;i like the original ideas in this movie, and I think it is entertaining and well made.
I:885;258;I really enjoyed Dark City.
I:885;259;I was drawn into the story and it held me there until the very end.
I:885;260;This is great science fiction.
I:885;261;First of all much older great films like The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds, as well as more recent fantastic films like, The Matrix, Momento, and The Others already exist so one might assume from the rehashing more recent amnesia/who am I films that keep coming out that all the good ideas are already taken.
I:885;262;After watching Dark City you will know that it is possible to tell a unique amnesia/ who am I story with a strong protagonist and still be original.
I:885;263;This propels his actions and choices.
I:885;264;With a dark mixture of the Gothic grandeur in METROPOLIS, the eerie make.
I:885;265;up of NOSFERATU, and the alternate realities of THE MATRIX, DARK CITY borrows from several sources to create a masterful horror fantasy world with its own unique set of laws and identity.
I:885;266;Though elements of the production may feel borrowed, the plot itself is creative and original, acting as both a murder/mystery and Sci.
I:885;267;The cast selection fits the film very well, with Sewell, Connelly, and Friels capturing a nostalgic Film Noir.
I:885;268;One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the incredible set design paired with excellent computer FX, giving the cold city an organic life as it shifts and molds to The Strangers sinister designs.
I:885;269;This gives it a modern epic feel, while the sepia tones and color palette deliver a throwback to classic Sci.
I:885;270;"provoking science fiction, and to admirers of ""The Prisoner"" TV series."
I:885;271;the sad part is that there were some really good ideas here.
I:885;272;"The central theme of the movie was an interesting twist on a ""Matrix""."
I:885;273;like concept, and in the hands of a director less obsessed with special effects, this could have been a fascinating and exciting movie.
I:885;274;I remember how much I loved this film when it first came out.
I:885;275;You will enjoy this if you are into suspenseful mood.
I:885;276;Keeps you on your toes, so to speak.
I:885;277;Everytime I am left speechless by the sheer originality and vision of this picture.
I:885;278;Mark my words five years from now this will be hailed as one of the best sci.
I:885;279;The Roger Ebert commentary is very informative.
I:885;280;"A new approach as far as I know in the ""we are being controlled"" genre."
I:885;281;Fresh enough to seem new.
I:885;282;This is a great movie filmed in the tradition of film noir, great cast, and acting.
I:885;283;Would recommend for those who enjoy sci.
I:885;284;Another great movie to sit down and watch.
I:885;285;I liked The Crow, and love Blade Runner and Matrix.
I:885;286;These all had interesting stories that took place within well.
I:885;287;Every day the Devil shows up and tortures Guy with some hip, CGI.
I:885;288;fi story line with good solid twists.
I:885;289;I loved the cinematography .
I:885;290;A unknown force wants to make itself immortal and thinks it can find out by discovering what makes us tick and why we are the way we are.
I:885;291;This is freaky stuff but very cool and acted superbly.
I:885;292;it twists, it turns and you are, for better or worse, pulled along with it.
I:885;293;The end is even more cool because its sad, but happy.
I:885;294;new and inventive, the film never fails to thrill and is a beautifully done piece of work.
I:885;295;something you'll enjoy alot, but little known in the world of film.
I:885;296;It has already become my favorite sci.
I:885;297;fi story, because of the great writing and artistic nature of the film.
I:885;298;From a technical POV, the filming was incredible with sweeping city shots, fantastic cuts made in the editing room, and wonderful set design.
I:885;299;The movie gives us a great setting.
I:885;300;And what a setting it is!
I:885;301;the Strangers are involved in a great experiment.
I:885;302;This is a potentially very interesting concept, and ripe for inventive exploration.
I:885;303;And before the wheels of the plot take over, it succeeds.
I:885;304;we are drawn by the potential of, say, exploring the core nature of humanity stripped of context.
I:885;305;that is, well within their assigned noir archetypes.
I:885;306;lower class, they act hammy, upper class, they suddenly become east.
I:885;307;despite my disagreement with Roger Ebert on the merits of the film as a whole, I find his commentary track to be among the best I've ever heard.
I:885;308;He postulates on the decision making processes of the director, and points up scenes that he thinks work well, and decisions that he likes (most of them he likes.)
I:885;309;It is clear that he loves this movie and his enthusiasm is great fun to listen to.
I:885;310;I really watched this because Jennifer Connelly, because watching her for an hour plus is always good and because Kiefer was a hair metal vampire from a movie in my teens that is still in my memory.
I:885;311;fi and this looked interesting and a little bit of a mind screw kind of flick.
I:885;312;I didnt think it was a five star the first time I watched it, not sure I really got it, but a buddy or two of mine really raved about it so I thought Id give it another try.
I:885;313;It really was a lot better in the second viewing.
I:885;314;Much like other movies that have the your reality isnt real premise the character grows as does your understanding of the world around him.
I:885;315;its just kinda exists and wasnt that special on any level.
I:885;316;"it's great to have both versions of the movie on 1 disc while I am not sure I'd recommend ""The Director's Cut"" to those first watching the movie."
I:885;317;well, I guess it would be.
I:885;318;Audio is great!Would I recommend that you get it?
I:885;319;Lastly, pay attention to all of the characters, detail and the overall movie.
I:885;320;It had all the makings of a great science fiction film: top notch acting, an original plot, spectacular visual effects, clever dialogue, and tension so thick it deflects bullets.
I:885;321;"And both ask the question, ""What is real?"
I:885;322;The aliens are the last survivors of an immensely ancient and dying race.
I:885;323;"The only way they believe they are able to save themselves from extinction is to learn to be ""human""."
I:885;324;"Being a wanted man, Murdoch is able to ""tune"" a little himself when his life depends on it."
I:885;325;Could there be more to him than that?As I said earlier, this is one of the most underrated movies from the 1990s, and one of the greatest American science fiction movies ever made.
I:885;326;the cast is also brilliant.
I:885;327;Rufus Sewell does a fine job capturing the essence of Murdoch, an average man who finds himself in circumstances that are anything but.
I:885;328;wife is Jennifer Connelly, one actress who is just as talented as she is good looking.
I:885;329;William Hurt gives us another fine performance as the cop that is pursuing Murdoch, but he also believes that there is more going on than what sees.
I:885;330;His character is not very realistic, but is enjoyable to watch.
I:885;331;And are memories a true reflection of our souls?But don't spend too much time thinking about that right now.
I:885;332;The movie has great sets, and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner.
I:885;333;s7100 7.1 surround sound system is totally immersive into a surreal world.
I:885;334;That this film is not better known and rated more highly is a crime!The movie manages to combine the style of 1950s science fiction and film noir in one package.
I:885;335;It then sets this in an atmosphere of the 1940s, while making use of up to date special effects.
I:885;336;The visual artistry of the movie is stunning, the story gripping, and the music score right on target.
I:885;337;i really like everything about this movie, and to top it all the director's cut blu.
I:885;338;Really cool movie, I was waiting for this edition long time ago, great sound and footage never seen before, got the director's comentary and some good extras as well, is a sci.
I:885;339;fi movie that you must own!
I:885;340;This flick is as the name implies rather dark, both literally and figuratively.
I:885;341;As whole how do all of the cuts add up.
I:885;342;The film is still a good one and thankfully the additions weren't as bad as to hurt the film like Appocalypse Now Redux and its great seeing them reinserted into the film.
I:885;343;of course the film itself has recieved a newer transfer that is brighter and more colorful.
I:885;344;You never really notice the added scenes like you do on some other films.
I:885;345;On the first it has the general making of where filmmakers and actors talk about the film itself.
I:885;346;in the end this is a great disc for fans of the film.
I:885;347;It also has a feature I really liked in the fact track that provides a little window to explain the difference between the theatrical and directors cut as well as background information on inspirations.
I:885;348;This was a neat feature especially for this fan of both cuts, and highlights a lot more scenes I missed on my first viewing.
I:885;349;It always happens in cinema: a film comes out that wows critics and audiences love.
I:885;350;Oh well, it's a great film anyways and shows The Crow wasn't Alex Proyas' beginner's luck.
I:885;351;I don't want to spoil the rest (because that opening narration would do it for me anyway) but it's a great film with some familiar scenes with a unique twist, including one twist late in the film that caught me off guard.
I:885;352;It's a really cool looking film, including one scene where we have a chase while the city goes through a little change.
I:885;353;Chase scenes have been done before but this at least makes it unique.
I:885;354;the special effects, such as Roger Ebert's slightly I'm.
I:885;355;But still a very good movie.
I:885;356;On first seeing this film at the cinema, it was clear that the writer and director had clearly set out to create a dream environment.
I:885;357;"If you like film noir, ""art house"" films, moody, evocative, bone chilling, science fiction ala' Fritz Lang ""Metropolis"", ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Crow"", then you will enjoy this film."
I:885;358;Rufus Sewell is a highly gifted actor, classically trained British stage star .
I:885;359;In other films, I've seen Rufus Sewell perform, he usually turns out flawless, heartfelt performances.
I:885;360;"most of his scenes are ""emotion"" reaction shots ."
I:885;361;and in that element, it is an outstanding artistic accomplishment.
I:885;362;William Hurt is masterful and gives a powerful performance.
I:885;363;sexy Rufus Sewell at the beginning of the film, but that is in very good taste .
I:885;364;"not a ""full frontal"" nude, just a tasteful shot from his side ."
I:885;365;Visually stunning with phenomenal set design, cinematography, a technical achievement .
I:885;366;ray director's cut is definitely something to look for.
I:885;367;Dark City is a film that will only grow with time, for not only is it a bottleneck work of art, but it's a transcendent film.
I:885;368;Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it transcends the limits of sci fi.
I:885;369;But the film makes use of imagery from sources few have ever noticed.
I:885;370;the scene of Murdoch on The Strangers' wheel is highly derivative of the flying death scenes in Logan's Run, and the early scenes of The Strangers causing the city to sleep for a tuning, with cars in the middle of traffic jammed roads, is a steal straight from the opening scenes of Federico Fellini's 8.
I:885;371;Great films, and works of art, like Dark City, transcend their natal genres, and join a higher club, for they have more in common with the great films of other genres, than they do with lesser examples of their genre.
I:885;372;And, the bottleneck status of Dark City also proves another point.
I:885;373;new, and this is the essence of an artistic bottleneck.
I:885;374;presented in new ways, mixed with new things, and, most of all, made better.
I:885;375;And in these areas that define what makes a work of art work greatly, Alex Proyas's film Dark City transcends to that rarest circle, greatness, even as, within the limits of its genre it stands alone.
I:885;376;When it comes down to it, a large part of who we are comes from our collective experiences, from our past, from our memories.
I:885;377;Soon he comes face to face with a startling realization: every night, at midnight, the world stops and time is frozen.
I:885;378;He utilizes his strong sense of visual direction but also creates an intriguing tale of identity.
I:885;379;The issues touched upon are timely.
I:885;380;What makes Dark City so unique is that it raises serious questions but, for the most part, leaves the answers to the viewers.
I:885;381;It's interesting to note that this film came out about a year beforeThe Matrixpopularized thought.
I:885;382;Regardless, it's obviously a misunderstood film.
I:885;383;wise, it's the usual alien nonsense but with some interesting twists you certainly haven't seen in other movies, like the city re.
I:885;384;because of that, the set designs and special effect are unique.
I:885;385;The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.
I:885;386;it draws you back for multiple viewings.
I:885;387;There is a magnetism to this film.
I:885;388;This is one more fascinating films of past decade.
I:885;389;A remarkably well done story and a giant in it's genre.
I:885;390;one of my favorite parts was the ending,which was a good one AND came off well for a change.
I:885;391;my favorite scene:when shown exactly where the city existed in space .
I:885;392;"It has a good (somewhat dark) score, the highlight of which is a lovely version of ""Sway"" (sung in the movie by Jennifer Connley's character)."
I:885;393;The best piece of advice I could give you, was given to me before I viewed this movie.
I:885;394;It is a great movie, and destined to be a cult classic.
I:885;395;I loved this film from begining to end.
I:885;396;It definitely had underlying meaning.
I:885;397;This is an amazing movie that wound up being my own Christmas present since the person it was intended for decided to go shopping for himself 2 days before Christmas and bought this.
I:885;398;ray from moving around and possibly being damaged!
I:885;399;Once again, my experience has been wonderful!
I:885;400;The fact that the events take place almost entirely at night benefits from Blu Ray's ability to let you see deep into the darkness with remarkable detail and clarity.
I:885;401;Discover this gem of a film and you too will know the way to Shell Beach.
I:885;402;I can say, without hesitation, that this is one of the best sci.
I:885;403;Not THE best, but ONE of the best I have ever seen.
I:885;404;An amazing story, great characters and a vision that is pure genius.
I:885;405;Only a man who has nightmares as a child could dream up such an incredible movie.
I:885;406;alex Proyas, the film's director summed it up best when he said I think being afraid of the dark is a very basic childhood fear.
I:885;407;The bald men (the villans) chasing the hero in this film is also from Alex's childhood imagination .
I:885;408;a film of dark noir that reminded me a lot of an episode of the Twilight Zone, yet completely fresh and original.
I:885;409;I love this movie and I think you will too.
I:885;410;Rufus Sewell, a virtual unknown to American audiences is fantastic.
I:885;411;Jennifer Connolly fits this role to a T and William Hurt is great as well.
I:885;412;Keifer Sutherland could have toned it down a bit, but he does a good job too.
I:885;413;Watch this film and you'll find out why .
I:885;414;Dark City opts for film noir, which is what this type of story is really best suited for.
I:885;415;"The main difference between the two movies is that ""The Matrix"" seems to have been created as a showcase for outstanding new special effects, while ""Dark City"" creates its special effects to accomodate the story."
I:885;416;Rufus Sewell's performance in particular is outstanding, as he slowly moves towards self.
I:885;417;style that they can't imagine both co. existing in a modern thriller.
I:885;418;"This movie does have a lot of style, yes, most notably the influence of Fritz Lang (Sewell's face, in fact, vaguely calls to mind Peter Lorre's child murderer in ""M"")."
I:885;419;But the movie is very substantial, too, and Murdoch's quiet final encounter with one of the Strangers, in a dark corridor following the climactic battle, is handled with perfect delicacy.
I:885;420;"I have a feeling ""Dark City"" will have a second wind."
I:885;421;A new film has entered the pantheon of my all.
I:885;422;time favorites, and it zooms right into the top ten.
I:885;423;fi/fantasy fans enough to see this film any way they can.
I:885;424;fi with the vision of Alfred Hitchcock, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, and Fritz Lang.
I:885;425;"His only possessions are the clothes he is wearing, a piece of luggage, and a postcard from ""Shell Beach"", a place that stirs childhood memories."
I:885;426;think a swarthy, young Christopher Walken) finds that he also has a beautiful wife (the lovely Jennifer Connelly .
I:885;427;Dark City is a master stroke.
I:885;428;The special effects are outstanding and do not overwhelm the film.
I:885;429;hollywood production is evident in the concept and its realization on screen.
I:885;430;"The latter film is one of the few quibbles I have about ""Dark City""."
I:885;431;The villains' costuming in their underground city is perfect,.
I:885;432;Otherwise, the production values are superb, creating a world and mythos that seem entirely plausible.
I:885;433;and that is the power of this film.
I:885;434;"Its dystopian vision, plotline, and fully realized production make it totally unique despite its ""where have I seen this before"" elements."
I:885;435;"interestingly, ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"" are remarkably similar in their basic outline."
I:885;436;"It's a more gripping film than its rival, depending more on dialogue, characterization, and sense of utter foreboding that ""The Matrix"" counters with more physical action and its groundbreaking special effects."
I:885;437;kudos to the writers, who in keeping with the timeless nature of the setting, avoided ALL profanity!
I:885;438;Still, this is a film for adults.
I:885;439;This is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile.
I:885;440;Few directors have succeeded since 1896 in presenting their imaginary world into a movie.
I:885;441;fiction genre since the seventies let directors like David Lynch create a fantasy world with the OK of the Hollywood moghuls.
I:885;442;dARK CITY is a masterpiece, a unique world invented by director Alex Proyas and he succeeds where Luc Besson, with THE FIFTH ELEMENT, failed.
I:885;443;"terrestrial battle scenes and expensive special effects 
I:885;444;dARK CITY is a movie sci.
I:885;445;In fact, you can recognize one of the themes of TOTAL RECALL in the way the Others steal and manipulate the memories of the humans they control.
I:885;446;at last, DARK CITY is full of visual ideas only a genuine movie director can have and reproduce on pellicle.
I:885;447;So let's wait with great impatience for Alex Proyas's next movies.
I:885;448;This film is a masterpiece of story, mind.
I:885;449;A must see if you like finding your identity films that have a fantasy.
I:885;450;Dark City is such a work of art, that other talented directors have based their movies on this one.
I:885;451;Like when Murdock, the main character, goes into a dinner and makes a display of his talents.
I:885;452;i have to say , I got I Robot, also directed by Alex Proyas, and Dark City is a better film by far.
I:885;453;, originality (can't say that for the Matrix trio) and it does have a secret twist at the very end, which gives us kind of a Butterfly Effect (another great movie with Asthon Kutcher, where memories also play a crucial role) totally unespected.
I:885;454;it was the kind of movie that comes around on a rare occasion.
I:885;455;Great movie if you are interested in having your thoughts provoked.
I:885;456;An excellent film, good picture and superb audio.
I:885;457;Great features and a great film.
I:885;458;This movie (without voice over spoilers) brings us to wonder about our world and our place in it.
I:885;459;And if we are careful, we notice that even our memories of the past subtly shift to explain what we encounter now.
I:885;460;the commentary by Roger Ebert was wonderful, filled with depth we seldom get in a commentary .
I:885;461;but then again, the movie has real depth.
I:885;462;obviously important in his mind, but not really informative to me.
I:885;463;It's a spectacular world, a noir setting and the kind of attention to sets, shadows, and sound that make a good movie a great movie.
I:885;464;It's really an experience and the blu.
I:885;465;ray helps make it happen.
I:885;466;It is a hauntingly realistic movie, and the special effects have mostly aged well.
I:885;467;if you loved the Matrix, then you'll love this!
I:885;468;good suspense and goodspecial effects strange plot people who like the strangei've seen this before wanted it for my collection
I:885;469;Good Science Fiction depends fundamentally on how completely believable it is.
I:885;470;It must be meticulous in the way that its world of fiction is constructed, or the fissures will be blindingly obvious.
I:885;471;Because they share a hive mind, they tap into and rearrange human memories, to learn what it's like to have individual minds.
I:885;472;congratulation: The Soul of Man will always elude capture.
I:885;473;It will always triumph over knife.
I:885;474;wielding Nosferatus and their exploitive schemes.
I:885;475;There are elements which could have come together gloriously: our hero creates a giant moat around the floating city at the end of the movie.
I:885;476;Let me start by saying that I love this movie.
I:885;477;It is dark and atmospheric, with a storyline that is compelling.
I:885;478;"Now cue up the same scene on the so. called ""widescreen"" version and you will see that most of the woman's torso is gone
I:885;479;great movie, with fantastic production values and decent acting.
I:885;480;feature with The Truman Show, also released in 1998.
I:885;481;I typically really like this type of movie, but this one got so dark that the happy ending, wasn't.
I:885;482;This movie is so visually stunning, words cannot describe!
I:885;483;I found it pleasantly subtle and thought.
I:885;484;"But that's the extent of the ""thriller"" aspect to the movie."
I:885;485;"if you have an appreciation for the ""classic"" style of movie."
I:885;486;making, you'll love this movie.
I:885;487;when watching, you'll be on the edge of your seat throughout.
I:885;488;like many good movies, Dark City's plot walks a knife.
I:885;489;i deeply enjoyed this movie.
I:885;490;It is visually stunning, thrilling, and it is so pleasant to see a healthfully.
I:885;491;budgeted movie turn into such an uplifting departure from the usual Hollywood .
I:885;492;this film gives us hope that for all of the major studio's failures, we can still occasionally spend the seven bucks on something worthwhile!
I:885;493;Many people, including professional critics, compared Dark City to such classic and modern masterpieces as Metropolis and Blade Runner, to name two of many.
I:885;494;Rightly so, since Proyas used cinematographic quotation several times in this tale of a man caught up in a world run by mysterious alien beings, known as Strangers, who lurk beneath the city surface and have the ability to shape their laboratory maze any way they please.
I:885;495;What IS original, and what sets this movie apart from many others is the direction and the acting.
I:885;496;The director, Alex Proyas (The Crow), does an excellent job of keeping this movie walking the fine line between familiarity and originality.
I:885;497;I thought it was unbelievably well acted.
I:885;498;As an individual, our personalities are determined by many of the events that helped shape our lives.
I:885;499;They are a part of us, our memories, and we have had a lifetime to consider them.
I:885;500;What this does is help put the viewer into the frame of mind of the characters.
I:885;501;They woke up and suddenly they have memories and they see things they didn't know existed a moment before.
I:885;502;We see some pans as we really come to understand, along with the characters, the full scope of the world in which they live.
I:885;503;this movie will really draw a viewer in, and for many people that can be uncomfortable.
I:885;504;I gave it four starts because the direction simply shines, and the attention to every tiny detail should be rewarded.
I:885;505;this is one of the greatest films ever made in the genre, with an end.
I:885;506;This is an interesting movie that has wonderful performances by Rufus Sewell, Keifer Sutherland, William Hurt, and Richard O'Brian (Riff Raff from Rocky Horror).
I:885;507;Good special effects considering it was made almost 20 years ago.
I:885;508;This is a visionary SCI FI movie that will be a cult classic in years to come.
I:885;509;And this movie showcases that talent well!!!
I:885;510;With a good supporting performance by Kiefer Sutherland in an understated, bumbly doctor role that is far from the mad scientists of the past, the movie takes you on a journey that shifts, twists and reshapes itself .
I:885;511;The effects aren't bad and the storyline is interesting, if not very plausable.
I:885;512;Futuristic with a hint of social commentary.
I:885;513;I highly recommend this film
I:885;514;A story that is worthy of classic science fiction, the movie the Matrix should have been.
I:885;515;This movie draws the viewer in with its masterfull visial depcitions, and allows the imagination to run abound.
I:885;516;Like most great science fiction, this movie is driven by an idea, and that idea is what makes the story turn.
I:885;517;To enjoy this movie the veiwer has to place onself within this world, and come to understand all of the things that this implies.
I:885;518;this movie is directed in a style of film noir.
I:885;519;This results in a city that is darker and more moving than Batman , and gives the movie more of an edge than Blade Runner .
I:885;520;This is a movie that can be easily mis.
I:885;521;This is what makes the movie so great.
I:885;522;This movie is one of the best science fiction movies ever made.
I:885;523;Such as the humans being prisoner, another world, strange beings, and The One who has the power of the beings.
I:885;524;Funny thing is, this movie came out before the matrix, and is much more satisfying in my opinion.
I:885;525;if you want a great acted and detailed science fiction movie to watch, pick up Dark City.
I:885;526;First off, I'll say that this was entertaining enough at first viewing, and visually it was indeed very good.
I:885;527;Certainly worth a watch on a slow Saturday night, if you're prone to such things.
I:885;528;futuristic piece fundamentally concerned with the question of a soul, and it's relationship to memories.)
I:885;529;finally, after the movie establishes that human identity is easily maniuplable via altering memories, Murdoch gives the old holier.
I:885;530;This is completely unsupported by the movie .
I:885;531;First off, it is gratifying to see such a high, collective rating for this film.
I:885;532;Eventually I was rewarded for my patience with a superb plot revelation.
I:885;533;As for the acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent, almost single.
I:885;534;All of The Strangers are memorable, particularly the lead characters who bring a seriously evil feeling to these nightmarish beings.
I:885;535;William Hurt is good here, adding a slightly cynical perspective and depth to the grand mystery.
I:885;536;As for the visual effects, some are outstanding while others need a little more work.
I:885;537;The look of the movie, from the costumes to the dark city.
I:885;538;All in all, this is a worthy edition to the Sci.
I:885;539;Dark City is an interesting scifi film with a twist ending.
I:885;540;It was a very enjoyable film, and I am surprised I never heard of it until I saw it here on Prime.
I:885;541;It's extremely watchable, and I enjoyed the special effects and the story line.
I:885;542;Taking that into account, the presentation is original, and it is well worth the watch.
I:885;543;The rest of the cast does very well, and the story line is pretty fluid.
I:885;544;The story is believable, and I would recommend it to many of my friends, even to the point of watching it again.
I:885;545;ray brightens the heart of the viewer with crisp images and full sound (LOVE that soundtrack!)
I:885;546;And this came with the Digital Copy, so I can enjoy this movie on the road on my PSP as well.
I:885;547;Original concept and great special effects will keep you entertained.
I:885;548;Very interesting plot and wonderful acting.
I:885;549;It was really pretty cool.
I:885;550;"Visually, it's stunning
I:885;551;day humanity as a pawn to advance their own agenda.
I:885;552;And in both films, the main character is a unique man who has the ability to transcend the illusory game he's been plugged into and create his own destiny.
I:885;553;DARK CITY beautifully and effectively combines elements of science fiction and film noir.
I:885;554;Humanity, as he discovers, has become the subject of an experiment by an alien race.
I:885;555;Not only is this a brilliant, original, and awe.
I:885;556;The sound and picture are great even if the people seem soft in a few scenes.
I:885;557;It also comes with a free download of the movie in standard format.
I:885;558;This is, in my opinion, One of the best filmed stories of science Fiction.
I:885;559;When it first opened it was not shown in my city, so when the video tape first came out I bought it.
I:885;560;the theatrical release is great but to really understand the film you need to see both versions of the film.
I:885;561;Anyone steeped in the dark Mysteries of the 40's, American experimentalism and German Expressionism will feel right at home in this well.
I:885;562;done derivative of these fantasy's in Black created in the Shadows of The Great War and World War II.
I:885;563;One could say that is part of the style of the film and fits the plot, but this seems to go beyond that.
I:885;564;Sutherland seems to have fun in his role.
I:885;565;But all in all a fun movie to watch with some interesting visual effects.
I:885;566;"The ""widescreen"" format is simply the fullscreen format with the top and bottom of the picture cut off so as to create an apparency of widescreen."
I:885;567;The shadowy and dark sets really help to carry the story.
I:885;568;Overall this is an outstanding film because of the actors and the story line.
I:885;569;The first few minutes are great.
I:885;570;A man wakes up without a memory.
I:885;571;I heard about this movie several years back and it looked pretty interesting and I was fairly impressed by the large amounts of positive reviews it got, and luckily for me, I found the whole movie on YouTube, so I didn't even have to invest one dollar at the local Family Video.
I:885;572;uNDERSERVED PRAISEFor reasons I can't comprehend, droves of people are calling this one of the best movies ever.
I:885;573;fi masterpiece that people are claiming it to be.
I:885;574;I guarantee that it'll be much more entertaining than Dark City will be.
I:885;575;Rufus Sewell is excellent, and the story keeps you engaged.
I:885;576;Interesting to see Keifer Southerland in the role he plays.
I:885;577;This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.
I:885;578;Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City .
I:885;579;"They deal with an illusionary ""real"" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys."
I:885;580;"But ""Dark City"" is very much unique ."
I:885;581;but it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy.
I:885;582;"All the dialogue is well written (""You know something, I don't think the sun even."
I:885;583;It adds to the dreamlike feeling.
I:885;584;suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers.
I:885;585;Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub.
I:885;586;Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.
I:885;587;"like Kafka on acid, ""Dark City"" is a unique and compelling sci."
I:885;588;fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot.
I:885;589;It is superb at translating theme through the use of the moody visuals and music.
I:885;590;A heady approach to the future of filmmaking.
I:885;591;saying I did in the theatres playing the Dark City trailers, but I gladly eat my words and look forward to seeing another like this from Mr. Proyas.
I:885;592;sci Fi that questions reality and existence, and it's got Kieffer.
I:885;593;this movie is as influential as the Matrix, and will stand the test of time (The Matrix may not).
I:885;594;"Great acting, beautiful set design, and ""a splinter in your mind"" theme runs throughout."
I:885;595;, and the answer is profound, if slightly disturbing.
I:885;596;The expanded Roger Ebert commentary is nice and should be listened too.
I:885;597;I love the aesthetics of the film, the photography and cinematography in general.
I:885;598;It really captures that noir element that it's going for, there's, mystery, insomnia, paranoia, vertigo, amnesia, detectives, and hookers.
I:885;599;it's all good, it's all there, it's all noir.
I:885;600;captre my attention over and over, again, because the mystery and visuals are so engaging, so effective I can't help but to keep watching the story.
I:885;601;Needless to say the performances and actors are superb, great cast.
I:885;602;"human theme, its references to men in black, it did indeed inspire films such as the great ""Equilibrium"", ""Men in Black"", ""The Matrix"" (which I'm almost tempted to call a poor ""Dark City"" remake attempt)."
I:885;603;It created a new genre then poked fun at its own noir elements.
I:885;604;It poked fun at the men in black, showing in its fun twisted way what the men in black might really be.
I:885;605;may I add: this movie is one of the best time travel films I've ever seen.
I:885;606;switching, the playing with human life and emotion?
I:885;607;"this is definitely a film to be filed among the ""classic sci."
I:885;608;"fi"" section of your home library, and more to the point, it is a film to be studied in all its glorious silliness, seriousness and spectacular special effects."
I:885;609;"It will show you deeper things than you ever saw in ""The Crow"" or ""The Matrix"" series."
I:885;610;I have always found this movie to be somewhat fascinating.
I:885;611;Obviously the suits at New Line wanted people to go see this because they liked The Crow.
I:885;612;It invented it's own ballpark.
I:885;613;It's much more complex and interesting than it sounds.
I:885;614;After seeing this film again, I can now look back on it and know it was ahead of it's time.
I:885;615;Now, in 2004, after seeing 'The Matrix' films, you will see MANY similarities and will probably enjoy the picture quite a bit.
I:885;616;Just remember, that 'Dark City' came out first.
I:885;617;It's actually the other way around.
I:885;618;fi films in the vein of Blade Runner, you will dig this movie.
I:885;619;It's got a couple commentaries.
I:885;620;One is from Roger Ebert, which I found quite interesting.
I:885;621;The actors did a good job of bringing a sense of realizim to the film.
I:885;622;Direction calls for a good note and special effects were tastefull and well placed (most of the time).
I:885;623;Minus 2 stars for story telling and the Dolby digital sound track.
I:885;624;If you stick with it, the story line will catch you.
I:885;625;Dark City is a masterpiece.
I:885;626;Fortunately Amazon's customer service is excellent.
I:885;627;This is one of the greatest Sci.
I:885;628;Nonetheless, I loved it when I viewed it.
I:885;629;This masterpiece of science fiction is about as dark as they come.
I:885;630;The visuals in the film are some of the most stunning I have ever viewed.
I:885;631;Truly original and breathtaking in its vision.
I:885;632;Detective Bumstead (William Hurt) was great in this film.
I:885;633;"With his former detective partner and friend going insane
I:885;634;But it is the alien beings themselves who are most intriguing.
I:885;635;"His ability to Que, as it is called, gives the rest of the humans hope
I:885;636;If you have not seen the film, I highly recommend it.
I:885;637;This is one of the greatest sci.
I:885;638;Any movie that starts with a man waking up in a bathtub minus a memory, but plus a mutilated body is bound to catch your attention.
I:885;639;Especially if that man is dark, mysterious Rufus Sewell (Murdoch) and the body has interesting designs carved into it.
I:885;640;Visually it is sumptuous, with its moody,1940s film noirish landscape.
I:885;641;And given their amazing powers, why can't they protect themselves from Murdoch?
I:885;642;But if you don't think too much, you can have a good time.
I:885;643;if you want to watch a movie that will keep you guessing right up till the final minutes, then this is for you.
I:885;644;a stylistic masterpeice, no wonder it got such high praise from siskel and ebert.
I:885;645;the movie fills you with a genuine sence of anxiety that you would get with any good action sci fi flick but the charaters are so well developed that you can really understand and identify with what they are going through emotionally.
I:885;646;but my god what a fun ride it was.
I:885;647;Based on the extremely positive reviews on amazon, and my love for sci.
I:885;648;Kiefer is outstanding, he controls the screen.
I:885;649;the cinematography and effects create the true aurora to this film.
I:885;650;It is one of the best visually stunning movies I have seen in a very long time.
I:885;651;dARK CITY is worth adding to a collection, especially in blu.
I:885;652;Movie is fun and the pre 2000 effects are great.
I:885;653;Movie inspired other great films like the Matrix.
I:885;654;I concur with the opinion that, though fun to see, the added footage is underwhelming.
I:885;655;Though I'm pleased I bought this version so I could experience the new footage, my yearly viewing of Dark City will be the original cut.
I:885;656;It's been a while since I watched this, but it left a good impression.
I:885;657;I mostly remember the acting being decent.
I:885;658;Dark City has been my favorite movie since I saw it in the theater in 1998 and this director cut version is better.
I:885;659;"With Mr. Shannon saying ""Dark City"" has precious little heart and soul,"" it makes me wonder if he watched the same film I have."
I:885;660;i would definitely recommend this film to anyone, particularly Sci.
I:885;661;It is strangely compelling, visually extraordinary, and an unbelievably rich experience from beginning to end.
I:885;662;A film that has almost been forgotten, it has achieved a well earned cult status.
I:885;663;Dark City is the finest film of its decade, one of the best of its genre, and one of the greatest ever made.
I:885;664;Fritz Lang proposed a challenge with his astonishing 1927 opus Metropolis.
I:885;665;Dark City has accepted the challenge, has risen to the occasion, and succeeds in every imaginable way.
I:885;666;Dark City takes the best visual elements of Metropolis and builds upon them.
I:885;667;I still can't believe it took seventy years for another science fiction film to pass the bar set by Metropolis, but I'm happy it finally happened.
I:885;668;expressionism, and the ways in which it echoes films like Metropolis, M, Mabuse, Pandora's Box, and Caligari are unmistakable.
I:885;669;The city itself looks amazing, and the lighting is exquisite.
I:885;670;This is a city I can look at for hours, and notice more and more detail the more I watch the film.
I:885;671;And in the end, taking Expressionism as a jumping board is one thing, but to pull it off so well is another, as it takes a great deal of imagination and creativity to be fully realized.
I:885;672;I am still taken aback by the creative wonder and virtuosity of the filmmakers, especially Alex Proyas, and how they so efficiently created a world so vivid in a visual style so difficult to manage.
I:885;673;The end result is an artistry that rises above that of Lang or Wiene.
I:885;674;As an audience, we are rarely treated so nicely, and catered to so thoughtfully.
I:885;675;the Film Noir touch compliments the Expressionism beautifully.
I:885;676;I think it adds up to a remarkable result.
I:885;677;Adding layers to the visual feast, and allows for far more detail and far more interesting characters.
I:885;678;The man from nowhere, the sexy lounge singer, the lonely detective.
I:885;679;as far as the cast is concerned, I thought everyone was just fantastic, especially Rufus Sewell as the Hero, John Murdoch.
I:885;680;The empathy he brings to his character here is telling of a truly gifted actor.
I:885;681;Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as well as the desexualized film noir heroine.
I:885;682;Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful, and reminds me personally of Dwight Frye's portrayal of Renfeild in Tod Browning's Dracula.
I:885;683;Richard O'Brien of Rocky Horror fame appears as one of the 'Strangers', and turns in very solid performance as Mr. Hand, by far the most interesting of the villains.
I:885;684;This film inspires me to be creative, and to believe in an idea no matter how nonsensical or weird it may seem to other people.
I:885;685;This is one of the few cult films that can really stand on its own, and be perfectly fine without a legion of followers giving it street cred.
I:885;686;If you have never seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and watch it.
I:885;687;the blu ray is wonderful.
I:885;688;Both theatrical and director's cuts are worth watching.
I:885;689;Lovely commentaries by Roger Ebert.
I:885;690;Performances and effects are quite good, but the basic premise is a little too tricky for its own good.
I:885;691;"This darkly telling of suspense and mystery has the perfect period piece
I:885;692;The entire plot concept is something described as explosively imaginative.
I:885;693;But this movie, even though it broke even at the box office, is a rare gem of gems in the world of sci.
I:885;694;This movie deserves it's own genre.
I:885;695;Call it dark revelation cinema.
I:885;696;This film is a treat for your eyes and ears and for your mind.
I:885;697;This is as much about characters as it is about the plot and the actors do a wonderful job making the characters exist for us.
I:885;698;The great work of Rufus Sewell should have garnered more notice.
I:885;699;He gives a performance that makes us aware of our own humanity and identity.
I:885;700;And the beautiful and underrated Jennifer Connelly is perfect as Murdoch's wife and love interest (not necessarily the same thing.)
I:885;701;Connelly always looks delicious but here we get to see her really do some fine acting in a difficult role.
I:885;702;The great work of Keifer Sutherland is surprising also because it's like nothing I've ever seen from him.
I:885;703;The film looks wonderful in widescreen and sounds very impressive.
I:885;704;If you haven't seen it, see it now!
I:885;705;cannot see how this is one of the most important films of our times.
I:885;706;In fact, what's perhaps most remarkable of all is I'm starting to get the impression even the actors and directors/producers of this movie don't realize what they did with this movie!Still today, people think of science as just info gathering and pointing at say the moon and saying . . . ope, there it is!
I:885;707;the discovery of the solar system is the classic example how scientists/mathematicians have to look behind the curtain to see the underlyin truth.
I:885;708;Just taking the immediate observations of the heavens(facts?)
I:885;709;Humanity is born without answers like the Dark City folk and slowly and maybe/hopefully enough hero's can wake up to see what's on the other side of the walls of ignorance we are all born in!
I:885;710;Very odd, kind of interesting, but I wouldn't watch it a second time.
I:885;711;The film is true to it's title and very dark making many scenes difficult to see while streaming.
I:885;712;It probably worked better in a theater.
I:885;713;It is very nice to see Rufus Sewell play something other than a villain.
I:885;714;Great cast and special effects and you are always in suspense.
I:885;715;But it won the award for the best sci.
I:885;716;This movie is my second favorite sci.
I:885;717;It's orignality is sure to keep the viewer's interest.
I:885;718;He puts on a very strong acting role, one of his best.
I:885;719;arrange people and give them new identities.
I:885;720;fi fan, I've often wondered how good this film was.
I:885;721;The story has an interesting concept and I believe that it could have been delivered much better than the cheese seen in this movie.
I:885;722;In twenty years this will be on mystery science theater.
I:885;723;Of course, it's best to have both, and 'Dark City' does a better job of combining bravura style with compelling plot and characters than almost anything else that I've seen.
I:885;724;This is a truly great flm, and at only 10 bucks you've simply gotta check this out.
I:885;725;This may not sound terribly exciting, but they work a lot of good stuff out of this setup, and it allows for a number of revelations which I found quite effective.
I:885;726;(though more astute viewers will likely see them coming) Perhaps most significantly, I find it quite personally involving, and think the major positive characters to be extremely symphathetic.
I:885;727;This is largely because I find the major thematics elements behind the film to be quite important.
I:885;728;the acting is generally excellent, and those who may suggest that some of the characters are a bit to cliched are missing the point entirely.
I:885;729;(though I will say that I think Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Schreber a bit too affected, but the film is strong in general.)
I:885;730;Also, the casting is absolutely perfect, particularly Connelly, Hurt and O'Brien as Emma, Bumsted and Mr. Hand respectively.
I:885;731;(And this is exactly as it should look) The shots are beautifully composed, with a strong sense of harmony and balance.
I:885;732;Fortunately, the denoumont is quite strong.
I:885;733;But what can I say, I want things to turn out well for John, and it's just an absolutely great moment when the sun finally rises over the city.
I:885;734;well, you just have to see it.
I:885;735;I was surprised when I saw it.
I:885;736;This movie has incomprable visual beauty.
I:885;737;This may very well be the most visually amazing movie since Kubrick's 2001.
I:885;738;At the heart of the movie is a very thought.
I:885;739;Blade Runner (the director's cut is great, the original is worthless) takes this question much further and really explores it, and it doesn't posit it with such obviousness.
I:885;740;Simply, there's a lot more to Blade Runner as a philosophical journey than Dark City.
I:885;741;movie philosophical discussion with your friends about the movie comes up a bust.
I:885;742;Dark City is one of my top 10 movies.
I:885;743;I love it's dark mystery and special effects.
I:885;744;as a sifi buff I am very pleased and it was well worth watching.
I:885;745;This movie is truly a master piece.
I:885;746;The dark atmosphere makes it in a way scary and unpredictable.
I:885;747;Jennifer Connely did a great job in acting in this movie.
I:885;748;I love aliens and this movie has them in it.
I:885;749;It was exciting to, a great thriller.
I:885;750;An addendum to the other reviews.
I:885;751;For example, take some one whose primary reality verification source is the Internet.
I:885;752;"Somehow, its more successful successor ""The Matrix"" did not (at least for me)."
I:885;753;It also stands out as an interesting, unusual, and well.
I:885;754;I tried twice, and got it this time.
I:885;755;This movie was a sleeper ,I never remember even hearing about it when it first came out but I really liked it !
I:885;756;I enjoyed the Matrix but I think Dark City is a much better film that's better directed, almost to perfection.
I:885;757;Roger Ebert's commentary on this explains a lot about the meaning of the spiral, the importance of lighting and the power of film noir.
I:885;758;He compares the fantasy world and the set designs to Metropolis and Blade Runner.
I:885;759;Ebert absolutely loves this film and named it the best film of 1998.
I:885;760;The theatrical trailer is awesome and the chapter menus are cool with actual scene bits you can watch with sound without actually playing the movie.
I:885;761;There is also the full screen version on one side of the disc so you can compare the two versions and see just how much picture is really taken out.
I:885;762;Dark City is a rare visual feast that will open your eyes to a world you have never seen before.
I:885;763;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:885;764;Don't think too much about this film.
I:885;765;A little darker than it's predecessor this film from a special efffects standpoint will keep you moving and wondering why the entire time.
I:885;766;this film could be watched without a soundtrack and still be a lot of fun.
I:885;767;The acting by Mr. Sewell was great as usual and his supporting cast held their own.
I:885;768;The twists are fun and inventive (however predictable if you know the source), but an interesting watch nevertheless.
I:885;769;Maybe our friends at the Criterion Collection will get their hands on the original and provide us with a brilliant rendition.
I:885;770;This movie truly is a psychological thriller with a sci.
I:885;771;In this guise the movie is very expertly written because we never learn something too soon.
I:885;772;It's actually a very deep film and if you pay attention to what's going on it asks very human philosophical questions.
I:885;773;While the film doesn't precisely answer these questions it does help us understand the antagonists called The Strangers.
I:885;774;despite the strong performances from Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connely (John's love interest), I think that Keifer Sutherland's performance was the most impressive.
I:885;775;He played sort of the mad scientist kind of role.
I:885;776;I just felt this was kind of out of the norm for Keifer and was impressed that he pulled this off so convincingly.
I:885;777;The film is so strong and so well written that these details can easily be overlooked as well.
I:885;778;If you like delving into bizarre worlds with a science fiction element then this is definitely a movie to watch.
I:885;779;I picked this up on a whim because it had an interesting cast and an intriguing synopsis.
I:885;780;Amidst all this complexity it maintains a very strong and dark 1920's mystery feel as well.
I:885;781;It's a very bizarre film, but also very well done in my opinion.
I:885;782;This is a complex film of alien mind control and matter control versus the strength of humanity.
I:885;783;In look it is remeniscent of Bladerunner, the aliens are straight out of Hellraiser but all together the film comes out as unique.
I:885;784;Dark City is an intelligent and enthralling film, and after watching it you will be a fan for life.
I:885;785;It is an interesting blend of sci fi and film noir, and a beautiful film to behold.
I:885;786;It is not a perfect movie, and has some flaws, but all in all it is a unique and interesting movie.
I:885;787;This movie stands as a classic all on its own.
I:885;788;One of the greatest strengths of Dark City is the slow unfolding sense of mystery which exists for the opening few acts of the film.
I:885;789;alex Proyas, a cult icon, directs the film with all the resources at his disposal when the film was produced in 1998, and the elements of solid production design remain.
I:885;790;"Buildings shift, time change and the viewer begins to question what the strange beings behind the city's movements question, ""what is the nature of the human soul?"""
I:885;791;It is one of the most intelligent, engrossing Science Fiction films to come out in recent years.
I:885;792;The film's visual style is stunning and the acting is first rate.
I:885;793;The story, about a man searching for his lost identity who begins to unravel a conspiracy involving everyone in the city where he lives, is very well presented.
I:885;794;I recommend this movie to anyone, not just Sci.
I:885;795;fi at it's best story.
I:885;796;The buildup of the story was most interesting, it had the who is he?
I:885;797;great acting on the part of the, at that time little known, stellar cast.
I:885;798;Jennifer Connolly, as usual, does a fantastic job as supporting actress in this movie.
I:885;799;fi movies then in other types of movies like Extreme Ops and A Knight's Tale.
I:885;800;a highly recommended love story.
I:885;801;`Dark City' strikes a chord in my disturbed soul.You are asleep and talking to yourself in a voice that sounds like you're breathing your last.
I:885;802;Nobody will listen to you.
I:885;803;welcome to your very own parallel universe.
I:885;804;it is a really good movie, almost entirelly filmed during the night (hence the name).
I:885;805;Kiefer Sutherland is wonderful to see as a psychiatrist that would make any patient loose sanity, just visiting him.
I:885;806;fan and liked Matrix, I don't think you should miss this.
I:885;807;When your grandchildren are talking about what created cinema from this decade they will mention this film.
I:885;808;It's in a class with Citizen Cane.
I:885;809;The story line is strong.
I:885;810;fi fan and like dark and visually stimulating stories.
I:885;811;I already own this movie and bought another copy for a gift.
I:885;812;fiction, I recommend this movie to add to your collection.
I:885;813;Good story, script, and acting with well.
I:885;814;I honestly believe that he actually did not lose it, he just liked the movie so much that he decided he would keep it.
I:885;815;i love this movie and have since the first time I saw it.
I:885;816;Not only for the adult themes, but also for the fact that it is a very interesting mind.
I:885;817;if you like fantasy and things that mess with your mind, this is definitely the movie for you!
I:885;818;Fascinating movie with the Blade Runner type darkness and horror that makes it so captivating.
I:885;819;This is a highly rated film.
I:885;820;its video and sound presentation are quite impressive.
I:885;821;fantastic anamorphic widescreen picture that looks almost like a high.
I:885;822;This is especially important for this movie because so many scenes are, well, in the dark.
I:885;823;The blacks are deep and clear and the colors are rich and natural.
I:885;824;The sound is also quite good (Dolby 5.1).
I:885;825;The movie looked and sounded great on my large.
I:885;826;It also helps if you have a high.
I:885;827;There isn't a lot of action whatsoever or not even that much suspense, but the movie is very interesting, exciting and unlike anything else that you've ever seen before.
I:885;828;this movie is visually stunning and has a very powerful score that goes along with everything that's happening in the movie.
I:885;829;this movie is definitely one of the best that I have ever seen.
I:885;830;i don't want to give away anything else about the movie so that you can discover this amazing movie on your own!
I:885;831;Believe me, this is one movie that everyone should see.
I:885;832;The plot and story of this movie is so remarquable and is probably the best and most interesting plot ever in a movie.
I:885;833;This is a movie that you don't want to miss out on and is a treat to the audience thanks to its stunning visuals, remarquable plot, excellent music/score and great acting!
I:885;834;This idea is extremely interesting .
I:885;835;the metaphor leads to brilliant reflections.
I:885;836;the stunning special effects are first rate as well as William Hurt acting , though the story deserved , to my mind , a major and best treatment .
I:885;837;"the time is the body and place of the history 
I:885;838;"top ""Disaster"" movies that are 99% fiction and 1% science."
I:885;839;"in contrast, `Dark City' is a rare beast
I:885;840;it's best to go into this movie without knowing anything about the plot, since unravelling the story is a key element of the film.
I:885;841;This is a complex and intelligent film, and requires some concentration to follow.
I:885;842;"the cast do an excellent job
I:885;843;stated, sympathetic performance as Bumstead.
I:885;844;Jennifer Connelly as Anna and Richard O'Brien as the sinister Mr Hand are also good in their roles.
I:885;845;winning performance as the creepy, enigmatic Dr Schreber.
I:885;846;the production and direction are top.
I:885;847;it's best to get the Director's Cut over the original release now that it's available.
I:885;848;estimated the intelligence of sci.
I:885;849;Trust me, this is one film you will enjoy working out for yourself instead of having it spoon.
I:885;850;really, this film just clicks.
I:885;851;indulgent storyline is made tight and entertaining because the casting, production, script and direction work so well.
I:885;852;"fi"" blockbuster then don't bother, but for those of us who were crying out for a return to ""real"" science fiction, `Dark City' is a masterpiece."
I:885;853;Top film this, one can't help having flashbacks of it.
I:885;854;This movie about shifting reality raises questions about identity and the world we can create for ourselves.
I:885;855;It has such an unusual story even for scifi.
I:885;856;Though this movie is not for everyone, anyone who appreciates a well thought out script that has you guessing until the end will love this movie.
I:885;857;it screams genius all the way with amazing set design and a completely of the wall story.
I:885;858;i watched this movie with a girlfriend and was very surprised at the end to find out she loved it as much as i did!
I:885;859;I guess you can tell I enjoyed it alot.
I:885;860;It's tense all the way through, but the best part of the movie is the very beginning.
I:885;861;The film starts to get a bit confusing later on though, but still a good watch.
I:885;862;People who say that the story has holes are absolutely right.
I:885;863;It had all the aspects of a great movies.
I:885;864;The filming was some of the best I had ever seen.
I:885;865;It was excellent, I loved it.
I:885;866;It is one of my favorite movies, it is out there, yet it keeps one imagining.
I:885;867;the plot works here for several reasons, unlike much in this genre.
I:885;868;Give the writers credit too .
I:885;869;and the sound track featuring a ton of brass, bass, drums and weeping violins fits.
I:885;870;a good chaser of this genre after watching the last couple of Matrix films.
I:885;871;"While ""The Matrix"" told its story in the world we know today, ""Dark City"" chose a film noir setting of the 1940's and stays true to it, with every single frame almost resembling a Hopper painting."
I:885;872;An example of excelent castings, art direction, thoughtful cinematography, and special effects, the film never ceases dazzling the eye and intriguing the mind.
I:885;873;It was a film far ahead of its time and looks like a film that could have been made with today's digital efects technology, and remains one of Roger Ebert's favorite films of all time.
I:885;874;Well worth watching if you're a fan of the Wachowskis, Christopher Nolan, sci.
I:885;875;"fi, ""Metropolis"" or ""The Crow"" the director's prior film."
I:885;876;The plot takes us to a super doomy/glommy always.
I:885;877;But if you like Matrix where ''external'' creatures are toying with humankind destiny and make you think what reality ''really'' is about then I highly recommend this to you.
I:885;878;Go and get it, I did it and believe me, I am a sci.
I:885;879;This movie is a work of cinematic and creative genius.
I:885;880;the movie is very consistent in even its most minscule features.
I:885;881;"How the Strangers do everything in circles (reminds me of the Ramans and their ""3"" rules), then when you look at the actual shape of the city itself, it's a perfect spiral (the rat maze in Dr. Shrieber's office is actually a ""map"" of the city."
I:885;882;Compare it to the Strangers' city map for their next experiment .
I:885;883;It captures the dark, gloomy essence of the movie's atmosphere, and also gives just enough to be able to see the actors' faces.
I:885;884;the characters are very well portrayed (especially Richard O'Brian.
I:885;885;all the way through, the film has a genuinely creepy feel to it.
I:885;886;The movie was amazing when it came out and the transfer was spectacular!
I:885;887;Mixing elements of film noir with bits of allegory, mythology and religion thrown in for good measure, Dark City is one of the most original and amazing sci.
I:885;888;It is a film that is destined to grow through closed circles until it reaches the level of a classic.
I:885;889;Some films transcend their meager box office totals to live long lives on video shelves and TV: this is one of those films.
I:885;890;He steps into the next room and dresses.
I:885;891;"this is the opening scene
I:885;892;I'd tell you more about the movie, of what it's about, but you'll enjoy it so much more if you discover it for yourself.
I:885;893;Imagine that all this is done by some extraterrestrial species that is testing the human race to see how they live and react.
I:885;894;The discovery of the extraterrestrials is that some humans can resist this process and then they stick to some dream of sunlight, a beach, the ocean, etc.
I:885;895;And this dream will lead these human beings into breaking the bubble to go beyond this selfcontained city.
I:885;896;It is interesting but it remains rather superficial : a real human being always wants to escape a limited space or time that is imposed onto him or her.
I:885;897;It is one of the finest homages to film noir that I have seen in awhile and it is a beautiful film filled with details and extreme craftsmanship.
I:885;898;Questioning of what is real and a certain underlying dread in the everyday.
I:885;899;It uses dialogue to provide movement and subtle, internal rhythms.
I:885;900;this is an important film and I think that time will give it burnish.
I:885;901;You will watch it more than once so you will get your money's worth.
I:885;902;I can see now why people compare this to the Matrix.
I:885;903;aliens using humans for their own purposes, dark Film noir elements, unique special uberhuman that saves the rest of humanity from the aliens, love interest of main character major part of movie , love playing large part in defeating aliens, etc. only thing is that the Wachowski brothers seem to have done a way better job and combining all the above elements that it makes this movie pale in comparison.
I:885;904;it's worth watching but Matrix is the movie you will remember!Who will forget all the memorable lines from the Matrix like the following:You take the blue pill .
I:885;905;you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit.
I:885;906;that you are a slave, Neo.
I:885;907;Think of a day you suddendly realize that.
I:885;908;breaking visual effects, terrific acting, heavily atmospheric, crisply paced and written.
I:885;909;it just works on every single level and it works brilliantly.
I:885;910;"Seeing this in the cinema the first time, my mouth was agape for a goodly portion of the film, particularly the ""tuning"" of the city sequences and the very memorable climax."
I:885;911;fi films of all time, and also goes into history with films like DARKMAN and THE MATRIX as the best comic.
I:885;912;And, there was nothing spectacular about viewing it on Blu.
I:885;913;A film drenched in atmosphere, a unique story, wonderful villains, great sets and solid acting: a superb film.
I:885;914;schizophreniac detective who knows exactly what's going on, a beautiful woman caught in the middle of everything, the never.
I:885;915;a beautiful film, brought down only by a rediculously out.
I:885;916;Rufus Sewell's performance is reminiscent of Peter Lorre's in the classic M , and the set decoration and production values are also a throwback to Fritz Lang's Metropolis , considered to be perhaps the grand.
I:885;917;Kudos to Roger Ebert for having the good conscious of naming this the best film of 1998!
I:885;918;dC is stellar in BD, and carries the reputation of fine digital mastering over to a new media.
I:885;919;one can watch the movie multiple times and see something new.
I:885;920;This is a truly great movie.
I:885;921;While the requisite special effects are present (especially at the end) it is the acting that shines through.
I:885;922;this film along with Gattica are some of the few true Sci Fi classics of the 1990's.
I:885;923;One of the reason I love this film is it dares to be a true Sci.
I:885;924;In the Matrix we have style for style's sake.
I:885;925;Dark City gave us a brief view of the aliens true form and it really got outside the box.
I:885;926;Again this is brilliant (I will admit the animation / CGI is substandard even by 1990's standards)A final note, if you will excuse the pun, about the music in this movie.
I:885;927;The main theme is a luscious bit orchestration that can be listen to on its own merits and Trevor Jones nails each and every scene with the right music.
I:885;928;DARK CITY is a rare gem and the director's cut elevates it from great to sublime.
I:885;929;I'm glad that Roger Ebert has championed the film and it has developed a following in the last ten years.
I:885;930;There is some softness occasionally but this rendering is superior to any that have preceded it.
I:885;931;"this BD has a nice selection of extras though I couldn't play the ""Director's Cut Fact Track"" along with audio commentary."
I:885;932;dARK CITY has my highest recommendation for everyone and this BD is the best way to watch it.
I:885;933;the costumes, the sets, the acting, all of it, is good or great.
I:885;934;i watch it least once a year, and I always enjoy it.
I:885;935;I like the additional material for the Director's Cut, as well.
I:885;936;"there is an interesting story about the name of Kiefer Sutherland's character, ""Dr. Daniel Paul Schreber"", which can be found inMemoirs of My Nervous Illness (New York Review Books Classics)I thoroughly enjoyed this captivating, darkling science fiction."
I:885;937;if you liked the original Dark City, I am quite sure you will enjoy the Director's Cut added footage and features, even more.
I:885;938;Movie arrived on time in perfect condition at a great price.
I:885;939;very interesting exploration of human cognitive ability in creative sci fi context.
I:885;940;Dark City has always been one of my favorite films since I started to seriously watch movies.
I:885;941;In the tradition of Blade Runner, which had equally abysmal elements that were perfected in a home video version, Dark City Director's Cut ditches the narration and immediately drops you into this fascinating world.
I:885;942;fi themes, an interesting post.
I:885;943;modern art direction, and pulp detective fiction, Proyas has created a sci.
I:885;944;fi film distinctly his own and one I feel everyone should watch.
I:885;945;The remastered presentation makes me look at the film in a whole new way.
I:885;946;It makes me appreciate the subtleties of Dariusz Wolski's amazing cinematography.
I:885;947;The black levels are excellent and there's plenty of that to see in this film.
I:885;948;Detail is extremely also high.
I:885;949;the film also sports an immersive 7.1 track.
I:885;950;The mix gives you a great sense of environment, highlighting the excellent score of the film.
I:885;951;packed with excellent bonuses also.
I:885;952;Some notable ones include:3 new commentaries for the director's cut version (including an excellent must.
I:885;953;A brief but informative intro with Director Alex Proyas.
I:885;954;A great behind the scenes doc about production and the film's reception.
I:885;955;There's also a sort of interesting doc on post.
I:885;956;anyone who enjoyed The Matrix deserves to also give Dark City a try.
I:885;957;This is by far better than the Matrix.
I:885;958;Better story, better acting, better special effects, better stars.
I:885;959;Rarely is the cinematic audience treated to something so fantastic.
I:885;960;The whole story accelerates towards a terrifying and fantastic climax, leaving the audience with plenty of questions, and thankfully the special effects are not the true stars, just props as they're supposed to be.
I:885;961;This has been a longtime favorite of mine.
I:885;962;This is a must see if you are a sci.
I:885;963;It's a great story .
I:885;964;The characters are unique and interesting (Sutherland's character has some very strange behaviors).
I:885;965;It has a mix of alien intrigue, mind.
I:885;966;esque and telekinesis) and good.
I:885;967;It's a fun and interesting watch.
I:885;968;You'll discover new nuances that make the movie even more special.
I:885;969;"I had the pleasure of seeing one of the director's previous films ""The Crow"" which is another great movie."
I:885;970;"now back to ""Dark City"" the movie has a very nice gloomy feel to the film and instantly it begins with mystery."
I:885;971;The plot was well written and the film has a nice surprise towards the end.
I:885;972;fi type of movies, then I recommend this movie to you.
I:885;973;"And if you are a fan of the director of ""The Crow"", then check this masterpiece out!!"
I:885;974;Screen writer David S. goyer ( Blade, Batman begins) Hits big time with a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing and has another great story line that is similar to the Matrix in the way that these people of dark city are oblivious that they are puppets in a bigger picture.
I:885;975;The look of the movie is a combination of a film noir crime story and a great American science fiction film that has roots in gothic euro style of science fiction.
I:885;976;The film has a great climax and ending that leaves you wanting to watch it again and again
I:885;977;Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is perhaps the best.
I:885;978;known (and certainly the most beloved) attempt to blend science fiction with gritty film noir flourishes.
I:885;979;courtesy prohibits discussion of the plot, the unfolding of which is crucial to viewers' enjoyment of the film, but suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems in Dark City, keeping with the best tradition of film noir.
I:885;980;the visuals in the film are terrific.
I:885;981;The setting is appropriately dark and menacing, and the lighting is evocative of all those wonderful 40s and 50s movies which so obviously served as the film's inspiration.
I:885;982;The acting is terrific, with Kiefer Sutherland taking an appropriately slimy turn as a mad scientist who may hold the key to the nefarious dealings in the city.
I:885;983;Jennifer Connelly is at her gorgeous best here as the endangered femme fatale.
I:885;984;day noir films such as Body Double or Chinatown , I guarantee you'll love Dark City , a truly unique film.
I:885;985;I appreciated its wonderful visuals and its oppresive atmosphere, but I came away feeling vaguely dissatisfied for some reason.
I:885;986;It's common to compare this movie to the Matrix, and while I would agree that I liked the Matrix better the first time around, after that first viewing I had very little desire to watch it again.
I:885;987;"Not so with Dark City
I:885;988;I wish Proyas had found a way to settle things psychologically rather than physically, but that is a small quibble, and the conclusion of the film still takes my breath away.
I:885;989;"Fast forward until you get to the ""Dark City"" title screen, and watch from there."
I:885;990;I would agree with almost anyone who says that Dark City is one of the most visually arresting cinematic efforts made in the last few years.
I:885;991;Fans can point to the devilishly clever plot, the casting of well.
I:885;992;To reveal more could very well spoil the whole movie, as Dark City utilizes each and every one of its scenes to build to a shattering conclusion.
I:885;993;This movie reminds me of Memento in the way that you need to pay close attention to what is going on in order to arrive at the ending fully informed.
I:885;994;the special effects are the best aspect of Dark City.
I:885;995;The floating Festers who appear from time to time and talk in a strange lisping accent work as well, especially when we discover exactly what these creatures are and what their relation is to the humans in the city.
I:885;996;A good question, and one that very few of the people in the city think about let alone can answer.
I:885;997;regrettably, I thought the characters in the film often took second fiddle to the special effects and eerie plot.
I:885;998;Dark City, while failing to fire on all cylinders, is still an enormously entertaining science fiction film.
I:885;999;In fact, the producers of Dark City even draw comparisons between their effort and Fritz Lang's monumental epic Metropolis.
I:885;1000;I wouldn't go that far, but Proyas's film is amazing on many levels and certainly makes for a couple of hours of great amusement.
I:885;1001;Visions of The Strangers , beings who can stop time and alter reality, also haunt Murdoch's mind.
I:885;1002;Kiefer Sutherland and Jennifer Connelly give fine performances along the way.
I:885;1003;i felt that this was a good , but not great movie.
I:885;1004;I did enjoy the computer animation, and the acting is good throughout.
I:885;1005;I would recommend this movie to sci fi and film noir fans.
I:885;1006;If you enjoyed The Thirteenth Floor, The Matrix trilogy and even The Truman Show, you will like this one.
I:885;1007;"In fact, this film inspired ""The Matrix""."
I:885;1008;This film has great performances, great directing, great sets, great special effects, and a great plot.
I:885;1009;fi mystery with some great action scenes added into the mix.
I:885;1010;The plot is very thought provoking, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:885;1011;These changes greatly add to the film.
I:885;1012;which brings me to the most important advice on this movie.
I:885;1013;fi, it's a lot more intelligent.
I:885;1014;ahah, i actually saw this in the movie theaters.
I:885;1015;it was very good, iliked the plot, i liked the acting and i liked the special effects.
I:885;1016;overall it was a very good movie.
I:885;1017;Great extra features and commentary.
I:885;1018;Amazing price so I simply had to get this one.
I:885;1019;After all the fighting he's done, John Murdoch is perfectly content to live in his (FAKE) city by the sea.
I:885;1020;On top of that he is wanted a for a series of murders.
I:885;1021;They switch people's memories and create new ones as well.
I:885;1022;fi movie, amazing special effects, good acting.
I:885;1023;If it does come out I will deff.
I:885;1024;be purchasing it, well worth the extra money.
I:885;1025;fi film about a man with no memory trying to unravel his past while being pursued by strange beings through an ever changing city is a visionary triumph.
I:885;1026;director Alex Projas went on to make the more mainstream I,Robot but this is his masterpiece here.
I:885;1027;it's inteligent inspires a sense of wonder and is the most visually inventive film since Blade Runner.
I:885;1028;admitedly the Matrix may have more explosive action but Dark City is full of terrific atmosphere and creative visuals.
I:885;1029;fi fans from discovering this film that Roger Ebert and I(though not in the same room)called the Best Film of 1998.
I:885;1030;and like any classic it's as good today as it was back then!
I:885;1031;some people would have you believe that this is better than the Matrix and that the ending somehow raises important philosophical questions.
I:885;1032;One human guy resists the aliens, overpowers them, and takes control of the spaceship.
I:885;1033;Oh yeah, he also gains god.
I:885;1034;like powers and can make the spaceship create stuff.
I:885;1035;ray made it feel like a whole new movie.
I:885;1036;This movie is definitely one of the best science.
I:885;1037;To call it the same thing as the Matrix is thinking with a simple mind.
I:885;1038;It doesn't follow a generic formula, and the acting is very good (despite many people's problems with Sutherland's job).
I:885;1039;The movie's use of grotesque images and special effects is skillfully done and never becomes tacky, which a lot of movies tend to suffer from.
I:885;1040;If you are, you will appreciate this movie for its uniqueness and great execution.
I:885;1041;This was a very interesting movie, the premise of a superior race playing a grand simulation game while trying to figure what makes humans human by swapping their memories.
I:885;1042;Some magnificent sets, with moody lighting.
I:885;1043;It was visually incredible, and the effects they pulled off in this movie (given that it came out in the late 90's) were jaw dropping.
I:885;1044;The movie is the freak child of film noir, mystery, scifi, and many more.
I:885;1045;The story is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who has patience with movies (you'll be very confused at the beginning).
I:885;1046;they could have done more with the special features I guess, but what you get is still great.
I:885;1047;This is one of my favorite science fiction movies.
I:885;1048;I first saw it in Mexico in Spanish and despite some comments you might read about it from some folks in my opinion [and of some critics I admire] it is a much underrated film.
I:885;1049;It is one of those films I can watch more than once and get something out of it each time.
I:885;1050;I'll have to look that up one day.
I:885;1051;Dark City is an inspired film.
I:885;1052;Rufus Sewell is always worth watching and delivers a thoroughly believable performance within the incredible world of Dark City.
I:885;1053;John Hurt is a good hard.
I:885;1054;The sets, the special effects, but above all the storyline keep one guessing and fascinated.
I:885;1055;A definite cult classic, which leaves lingering questions and a vague, but enticing disquiet in the viewer.
I:885;1056;I view this movie as a classic.
I:885;1057;brilliant and criminally underrated Sci.
I:885;1058;fi horror fantasy film noir combination from director Alex Proyas (The Crow) puts all those genres in one amazing cocktail that leaves you on the edge of your seat.
I:885;1059;The film is smart and visually stunning at the same time with a clever original storyline, This movie has always been a dream project for Mr. Proyas.
I:885;1060;William Hurt with Richard O'Brien with sexy Melissa George co. stars in the labyrinth of a movie that keeps you thrilled, entertained and even brain.
I:885;1061;teased that predated The Matrix only i think this is superior.
I:885;1062;The Matrix is excellent but this one is even more brilliant as i enjoyed loving this movie since i saw it in theaters at age 15 turning 16 since i've always been a Sci.
I:885;1063;This offers an even better director's cut version that improves on the original movie as well as the original theatrical cut, five commentaries, director's cut fact track, Text essays, featurettes, production gallery, Neil Gaiman review of Dark City and trailer.
I:885;1064;The same soundtrack is used in the film, but the beat and harmony is altered slightly and in a positive way.
I:885;1065;The Director's Cut version of Dark City has additional scenes included within the movie.
I:885;1066;The added scenes are a much welcomed improvement to the film as a whole.
I:885;1067;The trailers for Dark City suggested a film so complex and impeneterable to leave the viewer rather confused at its conclusion, yet in execution the film makes far more sense than the intriguing montage in the trailer.
I:885;1068;helped along the way by a woman claiming to be his wife (Jennifer Connelley) and a pendactic psychiatrist (Kiefer Sutherland), Murdoch learns that his pursuers are a race of aliens with the power to warp reality with their minds who continually change the city and the memories and even lives of the people inhabiting it in an experiment designed to save their lives.
I:885;1069;Murdoch has developed their same power to tune and save humanity from the aliens' machinations.
I:885;1070;carried across on two levels as both human memories are manipulated and the physical world itself changed on a nightly basis.
I:885;1071;is done fairly well if somewhat less successfully than the in the Matrix.
I:885;1072;replete with dark imagery suiting the film noir genre and quite at home in Blade Runner, the movie makes for a stunning visual performance.
I:885;1073;The aliens are masterfully done as frightening and eerie outsiders.
I:885;1074;The video and audio transfers are crisp and clean.
I:885;1075;I'm not sure which movie was better, but they're both worth watching.
I:885;1076;That's the kind of movie it is.
I:885;1077;The latter is a great movie and one of my favorites, but I suspect the Wachowskis watched _Dark City_ while they were turning their storyboard into a screenplay.
I:885;1078;"delightful as his wife
I:885;1079;Ignore this obvious poor performance, and the film is excellent.
I:885;1080;fi kinda stuff, you've found it.
I:885;1081;Some pretty good actors and acting in it too.
I:885;1082;I like weird movies, so I liked it.
I:885;1083;i went to see Dark City because the trailers sold it as a film noir with stunning visuals.
I:885;1084;It delivered on the noir, the visuals, and so much more.
I:885;1085;alex Proyas, after directing the hypnotic comic.
I:885;1086;Free to create as he pleases, he concieves a film that references such varied sources as Fritz Lang's M and Metropolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.
I:885;1087;The city itself is one of the most fully realized of all fictional cities, taking shape as a character as important as any of the humans.
I:885;1088;if you love cinema that makes you think, pulls the rug out from under your feet, has amazing visuals and a compelling story, look no further.
I:885;1089;Dark City combines the best of detective noir with a journey to the heart of what makes a man, within a framework that has just enough science fiction to take it beyond our normal experience.
I:885;1090;I will keep this short: excellent dark, mysterious movie and looks AMAZING on Blu.
I:885;1091;Yes, Dark City is my favorite movie ever made, and while this Blu.
I:885;1092;Many great special features and generally everything you could ask for.
I:885;1093;ray is the best way to see it.
I:885;1094;As a film it stands with the best of dystopian Sci.
I:885;1095;This is by far one of the best movies made in 1998.
I:885;1096;I was glad to see that in the shadow of the Hollywood blockbuster, a movie with such incredible style and originality could be created.
I:885;1097;A classic example of an overlooked treasure.
I:885;1098;Okay, so there are lots of reviews here, you pretty much know the story.
I:885;1099;this is no hyperbole: this is the greatest film I have ever seen.
I:885;1100;The film is a reflection on what and who we are.
I:885;1101;i love the visual storytelling.
I:885;1102;And I still do nearly every time I see that scene.
I:885;1103;Add to that a striking score, and you've got loads of non.
I:885;1104;verbal story going on here.
I:885;1105;Kiefer Sutherland did a great job in this great movie.
I:885;1106;For me this is a huge statement.
I:885;1107;I've been a fan of the film since I first watched it in 1998.
I:885;1108;In Dark City, Proyas creates something special and memorable.
I:885;1109;dark City's cast is amazing: performances by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt are dry, depressing, and spot on.
I:885;1110;Dark City is also one of the best written science fiction movies from the late 90's.
I:885;1111;In some of those rare instances (Blade Runner), a proper choice of cut can absolutely make the movie.
I:885;1112;ray version, the transfer is spectacular.
I:885;1113;The picture and sound are absolutely crystal clear and stunning.
I:885;1114;if you enjoyed the original I would highly recommend that you pick up the Director's cut on blu.
I:885;1115;"while it is an intriguing idea
I:885;1116;"They are a dying race, they need a new place to live
I:885;1117;phobia but they plant the idea of a beach resort in everybody's memories.
I:885;1118;Worthy film on the style alone.
I:885;1119;The movie works even if you are not comic book aware.
I:885;1120;This is a fantastic movie.
I:885;1121;that said, if you haven't seen the movie, definitely watch it!
I:885;1122;It was pure chance that I watched Alex Proyas's masterpiece back in 1998.
I:885;1123;I won't spend more time discussing the merits of the movie itself, let's just say it ranks in my top 3 as a stunning work of art and philosophy.
I:885;1124;the changes in the Director's Cut are actually quite significant, and watching it I repeatedly raised my eyebrows and even gasped at a few of the scene changes.
I:885;1125;Watching it on my friend's Pioneer Plasma was a fantastic experience.
I:885;1126;As you can imagine, black levels are extremely important in this movie, and Proyas's excellent cinematography can really shine in this format.
I:885;1127;The surround sound is equally amazing.
I:885;1128;i haven't checked out the extras but this is a great movie in a great presentation.
I:885;1129;The film is very well done, with very good fx, but most important, with an excellent plot (probably where new films mostly fail).
I:885;1130;and lots of additional features.
I:885;1131;ray version is absolutely stunning!!
I:885;1132;the finest BD I've to date.
I:885;1133;This is Alex Proyas' best film.
I:885;1134;fi that it beautifully rendered with fantastic story, set design, music, and cinematography.
I:885;1135;2 stars because, for an older movie, it LOOKS amazing on blu.
I:885;1136;I received it and I watched it immediately on my PS3.
I:885;1137;It worked perfectly, the picture and audio were amazing.
I:885;1138;The picture is still as amazing as it was before, but the audio is HORRIBLE.
I:885;1139;"screen ""graphic otherworld"" genre, and DARK CITY fits the mold quite nicely.Yes, there are flashes of Fritz Lang throughout this visually satisfying cocktail of sci."
I:885;1140;I watched this movie about six years ago and loved it.
I:885;1141;The concept is both novel and well written, but the special effects have not aged well, and they're almost distracting.
I:885;1142;fi fans should definitely watch this with an open mind, though, its worth a viewing.
I:885;1143;I love science fiction and I love film noir.
I:885;1144;The visuals are very nice.
I:885;1145;Actually, they're the best thing about the movie.
I:885;1146;So let's put a star in the visuals box.
I:885;1147;"William ""Cardboard Man"" Hurt actually almost works as the hardboiled detective, until you realize that his name is Bumstead."
I:885;1148;I'll be kind and say she's just wrong for the part, but she does manage to sing two songs fairly well.
I:885;1149;But compared to the headliner, Rufus Sewell, she's a dream.
I:885;1150;the plot is very meticulous, so I'll only reveal a part of it: John Murdoch wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is or where he's been.
I:885;1151;The acting is great, Rufus Sewell especially, and the effects and set design evoke both creepy and beautiful images.
I:885;1152;if you haven't yet seen this movie, you must be absolutely crazy.
I:885;1153;It is hard to give this movie a star.
I:885;1154;If you like some of the good older scifi movies this is definitely following that and I got to say this is as far as I know the newest movie that completely plays on the older ways of making a classic scifi!Definitely worth watching for those who enjoy a good movie a dark night!
I:885;1155;Makes a great puzzle to assemble when you don't know what's going on.
I:885;1156;ray addition as well for those who prefer that version.
I:885;1157;In my opinion, this is a compelling movie.
I:885;1158;The screenplay was very good and the cinematography was amazing.
I:885;1159;If you watch it with an open mind, you will see that it gives the viewer the impression that they are watching someone's private nightmare.
I:885;1160;DARK CITY is full of computer.
I:885;1161;Handsome, intense and as sexy as they come, he would have been enjoyable even with the sound off.2.
I:885;1162;The ending reminded me of the Matrix, but it was very interestingly done.
I:885;1163;This film had absolutely terrific special effects, and featured some good performances of an interesting theme.
I:885;1164;As everyone knows, cinema is very much a visual medium, capable of conjuring up some of the greatest feats of the visual imagination.
I:885;1165;It's probably why we love the movies so much.
I:885;1166;some of the greatest ones have the ability to touch upon our imaginations and perceptions just as effectively as other artforms (like literature) can, but movies do it through visual means.
I:885;1167;alex Proyas' DARK CITY is a film that takes advantage of the visual possibilities of the medium and creates a world of dark.
I:885;1168;toned but spellbinding visual splendor.
I:885;1169;With the help of startling special effects, first.
I:885;1170;rate art design, and the widescreen cinematography of Darius Wolski, Proyas truly gives us a feast of awe.
I:885;1171;inspiring futuristic visuals that thrill you with its sheer imagination.
I:885;1172;There is a visual energy and grandeur here that is certainly not to be gainsaid.
I:885;1173;fi films, it's a bonus if we get a good story to go along with the awesome visuals.
I:885;1174;DARK CITY stands above the pack because it has a compelling (or, at least, compelling enough) plot to support the epic.
I:885;1175;changing realities, but with ideas about what truly makes up the human soul (is it the mind or the heart?)
I:885;1176;proyas and editor Dov Hoenig do a good job of driving the plot along and truly involving us in it nearly every step of the way.
I:885;1177;DARK CITY remains, above all, a triumph of awe.
I:885;1178;inspiring visual imagination and special effects that almost helps compensate for the thin characters.
I:885;1179;This is a movie that reminded me of why I love the movies so much.
I:885;1180;"Just wanted to write a quick ""I loved it"" piece."
I:885;1181;"If you liked ""Brazil"" and other movies like that, you will love this movie."
I:885;1182;"Try it
I:885;1183;this is a 1 disc set and comes with both the original and the directors cut.
I:885;1184;there are also a wealth of extras on the disc including many audio commentaries and documentaries.
I:885;1185;but rich in content and good plot.
I:885;1186;Original and creative, if not a little gruesome.
I:885;1187;Well acted and written, with good special effects.
I:885;1188;This is a really cool movie.
I:885;1189;Its has an original story great cinematography and some pretty good actors.
I:885;1190;This is a great gothic sci.
I:885;1191;It's definitely one of a kind.
I:885;1192;This is one of the best sci.
I:885;1193;It is visually unique, suspenseful, intelligent and surprisingly romantic.
I:885;1194;It's up there with the matrix and very eye opening
I:885;1195;This is a film that screams originality!
I:885;1196;One of the great things about the movie is that you discover all the secrets throughout the film.
I:885;1197;This movie always gets compared with The Matrix .
I:885;1198;The Matrix sets its world in modern day while Dark City goes into an unknown world with 1950s qualities.
I:885;1199;But The Matrix only teases us with ideas of a great science fiction and falters in the end to another action film with an action flim ending while Dark City delivers with a plot that is science fiction to all the action films.
I:885;1200;I liked how they made it faster because it set up the film to be better on more viewings.
I:885;1201;I do assure you that there are great performances in this film especially by Kiefer Sutherland in his supporting role.
I:885;1202;"i had seen the great price and thought ""hay I may like this."
I:885;1203;Well because it was so cool I felt it was already worth the great $9.99 price and I wanted to watch the whole thing in blu ray format.
I:885;1204;all the actors did a fine job as well as the backdrop of the city and the stile in witch it was filmed.
I:885;1205;the clues are all there and placed at a good pace up to the reveal.
I:885;1206;it received 4 stars from me.
I:885;1207;if you like sci fi and a good ride.
I:885;1208;All the performances are great especially the underrated Kiefer Sutherland.
I:885;1209;The extras are all informative.
I:885;1210;now if the director would have taken the talent he shows here up a notch with I, Robot instead of going down a level.
I:885;1211;"I love how dark this movie is and it's from the director of""The Crow"" you can't go wrong with this movie check it out."
I:885;1212;The movie brings to us the idea that we can't go anywhere from where we are, and we don't now where do we came from, and we are nothing more but a sum of our memories.
I:885;1213;I bought this movie because I LOVE unique,weird sci.
I:885;1214;The cast was awesome and the effects were cool.
I:885;1215;The movie was an original work of art.
I:885;1216;This is a classic sci.
I:885;1217;I've really likes this movie for a long time.
I:885;1218;It did seem this director's cut really changed the story quite a bit from the original.
I:885;1219;I may also get the original, but this one is still good.
I:885;1220;there is some stylish production values in the oddball city where it is always night and rainy, and there are many famous actors in the starry cast.
I:885;1221;This Director's Cut gives a clear understanding of this fantastic movie.
I:885;1222;One day you are a family guy, totally devoted to your wife, and in another day you become a serial.
I:885;1223;I really enjoy the story and the production.
I:885;1224;The director's cut is even more interesting, and the blu.
I:885;1225;in my honest opinion, this is a flick that will impress those that will let it.
I:885;1226;In the opinion of of a casual movie fanatic (If that makes some sort of sense), this is a movie that deserves at least one viewing from even the most casual of viewers.
I:885;1227;This movie is a breath of fresh air for sci.
I:885;1228;Very good movie that makes you think.
I:885;1229;Also keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:885;1230;Acting was very good and convincing.
I:885;1231;I knew it would make the perfect Christmas gift.
I:885;1232;even though my bf has yet to receive this gift, I'm quite positive he will love it just as much as I love my copy.
I:885;1233;So, I've given it 5:5 because, 1) it's a great film and 2) I know he's going to like it.
I:885;1234;because it's the best possible version of the film.
I:885;1235;Loove movies that give you food for thought!Very well done, great cast, I had to watch twice to get most of it!some violence on the body level.
I:885;1236;A must see mind bender!
I:885;1237;This is a fantastic film.
I:885;1238;fi horror overtones will get under your skin and give you chills.
I:885;1239;This movie is one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time.
I:885;1240;Seldom does a movie keep me guessing right up to the very end but when all is finally revealed it is the most one of the satisfying cinematic experiences you'll have in a long time.
I:885;1241;a true mix of Film Noir and science fiction unlike any other.
I:885;1242;inch Sony Bravia it is still a masterpiece.
I:885;1243;An escape from reality with a surprise twist at the end.
I:885;1244;Must see movie for sci.
I:885;1245;This movies strength comes not from costly special effects but rather a good story line, acting, cinematography, art direction, and set design.
I:885;1246;fi movie and an enjoyable way to spend an evening.
I:885;1247;This movie is very fascinating to me, it has great special effects and the story is very captivating.
I:885;1248;"Since the first time I saw ""Dark City"" It became one of my top Fiction movies."
I:885;1249;a) Direction: Proyas gives a cool example of new Science Fiction.
I:885;1250;noir cinema with shady visuals and Gothic sets.
I:885;1251;The manage of the main characters is very good and never too predictable.
I:885;1252;b) The actors: I love Jenniffer Connelly with all my heart and I loved the scenes when she sings (dubbed of course).
I:885;1253;Rufus Sewell and William Hurt are good as usual but I loved the Sutherland character as a scientist with no memories.
I:885;1254;c) The plot: The premise of having no memories and changing who you are night after night is so cool.
I:885;1255;"And then the ghostly aliens using death people's bodies and dressed like a ""Matrix"" buddy are very good designed."
I:885;1256;"d) The production: Wonderful special effects
I:885;1257;The pulsating music, the misterious passages and the Final triumphant bombastic conclusion is Trevor in one of his best works.
I:885;1258;Good for him!The movie is a full circle and I simply love it.
I:885;1259;dark City is one of the most outstanding movies.
I:885;1260;Not onlyrich in plot, great visuals, and very stylish, but you've gotspace aliens!
I:885;1261;He has to solve a mystery while he hides from police and his wife.
I:885;1262;Dark City is a great film with lots of twists and turns.
I:885;1263;The original theatrical cut and the new director's cut is included.
I:885;1264;Of you like modern film noir this movie is for you.
I:885;1265;Great story line, dark and unpredictable.
I:885;1266;This is dark, strange and oddly attention holding and entertaining.
I:885;1267;A friend recommended it, and I don't regret getting it.
I:885;1268;Completely unique, imaginative, stylish, and an atmosphere that is not going to be easily surpassed.
I:885;1269;This movie is a classic.
I:885;1270;The effects are absolutly beautiful, the acting is superb (and in my opinion the characters are by no means flat as others will try to have you believe) and the story and developement are intensily smart.
I:885;1271;This movie is more than a movie.
I:885;1272;The fact that we are actually the rats in the maze is great.
I:885;1273;Characters have been expanded further and the pace was tightened up on what I considered to be an excellent movie to begin with.
I:885;1274;Once past the abbreviated beginning the story now has a bit of extra time to develop the details further.
I:885;1275;Three documentaries (totaling 82 minutes) help to flesh out an already spectacular thought.
I:885;1276;It's a cut which has the fans of Dark City and neo.
I:885;1277;so sort of movie, so I ended up seeing a lot of other movies before finally watching this one.
I:885;1278;this movie has a lot of sharp images, and a fair amount of special effects, but for once, the effects were an integral part of the story, and didn't seem like they were just tagged onto the movie because they were able to do them.
I:885;1279;For me, everything was weaved together to create a strong looking, and strong feeling, movie.
I:885;1280;the basic plotline behind the movie is that an alien species, with the ability to distort time and reality(what they call tuning), has come to our world, and is trying to see what it is exactly that makes humans human.
I:885;1281;There are two commentaries, but I recommend putting on Roger Ebert's of the Sun Times.
I:885;1282;I don't always agree with him on his movie reviews, but his commentary is very insightful, and I learned a lot of things, and found out a lot more things about the movie that I didn't catch on my first viewing.
I:885;1283;This is a great science fiction movie.
I:885;1284;Keeps you going until the end and great special effects.
I:885;1285;I watched the entire thing on You Tube and really enjoyed it.
I:885;1286;This movie kept me guessing until the very end.
I:885;1287;They did a great job leaving me in question as to what was happening.
I:885;1288;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:885;1289;But you can trust the filmmaker.
I:885;1290;for me, this film has great rewatch value.
I:885;1291;"The sets, colors, writhing landscapes (yes, ""writhing"") and well."
I:885;1292;"crafted story all contribute to an unusual cinematic experience that has put ""Dark City"" into the quasi."
I:885;1293;"While Blade Runner is an all time ""pure"" Sci."
I:885;1294;fi great, Dark City really transcends the Sci.
I:885;1295;Its stunning visual effects are loads of fun (especially watching what happens when the aliens get killed) and the film is short enough to facilitate repeat viewings without becoming tiresome.
I:885;1296;Highly recommended and sure to be a cult classic if it isn't already.
I:885;1297;Some cliche moments but overall a really good movie.
I:885;1298;The special effects are cool, the plot is interesting, similar to that of The Matrix.
I:885;1299;and it has some amazing reveals throughout.
I:885;1300;If you like clever science fiction with a dark twist, you'll like this.
I:885;1301;this film does a great job of mixing Philip K. Dick.
I:885;1302;The result is a slick production that admittedly is not for everyone, but fans of either genre will almost certainly like it.
I:885;1303;That's just personal preference, and others may be more satisfied by the pay.
I:885;1304;Even then, I'm willing to overlook these (and a few other flaws) and enjoy the holistic effect: the total of enjoyment was greater than sum of individual parts.
I:885;1305;scheduling, a slightly unattractive cast.
I:885;1306;Beyond that, it featured a really cool trailer.
I:885;1307;the movie is actually JUST LIKE THE TRAILER.
I:885;1308;This means you pays your money and ya' gets what you pays for.
I:885;1309;Trevor Jones's awesome ambient score is his best since THE DARK CRYSTAL and MERLIN as we are told the story of a city inhabited by total and indefinite darkness.
I:885;1310;The four main(human) characters are integral to the movement of the plot.
I:885;1311;Rufus Sewell plays his character, John Murdock with a brilliant paranoid edge.
I:885;1312;murdock later discovers that he has a wife played by the strikingly gorgeous Jennifer Connoly and that he was seeking treatment from a seemingly whacked.
I:885;1313;kinetic power that allows him to move, destroy, or create objects.
I:885;1314;homage sets are something to admire.
I:885;1315;This is one of the coolest sets since Tim Burton's BATMAN.
I:885;1316;Another track features Trevor Jones's brilliant score.
I:885;1317;The rest of the disc features a cute little game where you get to find Shell Beach , set designs, the trailer for the film, and news.
I:885;1318;The movie also comes in Widescreen and Pan.
I:885;1319;The picture is perfect and as always, New Line does a great job with the sound.
I:885;1320;fiction classic in my book and has what so many sci.
I:885;1321;Let's hope that director Alex Proyas(THE CROW) can keep his winning.
I:885;1322;The film:Dark City is one of the standout science fiction movies of the 1990s, along with Gattaca, The Matrix, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers.
I:885;1323;the sense of claustrophobia and dread are well developed, and the setting, which uses evocative period details, especially art deco and 50's modern styles, is eerie and cool.
I:885;1324;This is a film that rewards multiple viewings, and the DC is the way to go to get the most out of it.
I:885;1325;But digital noise reduction has scrubbed away some detail, especially in faces.
I:885;1326;"Brightly lit scenes fare much better in terms of detail, which is part of the issue in a film called ""Dark City."""
I:885;1327;**********For the price, any fan of science fiction with a Blu.
I:885;1328;It's a very strong science fiction plot with a lot of good creepiness and a few mind twisting themes.
I:885;1329;It is instead, film noir, scifi, and even thriller all packaged into a unique style of film.
I:885;1330;Consequently, there is very much a theme of salvation about the movie.
I:885;1331;and when he rises again overthrows the most powerful of them.
I:885;1332;This is followed up with a resolution that offers a new life to everybody in the floating city.
I:885;1333;While there are allusions there, Proyas has intended to make a darkly entertaining, and thought provoking film.
I:885;1334;It is a film that will stand up against close scrutiny, and so can be watched more than once, with new insights discovered each time.
I:885;1335;the Strangers are very communisitic in nature, borrowed undoubtedly from Fritz Lang's classic, Metropolis.
I:885;1336;Because of this, the film serves as an homage to many sources .
I:885;1337;scifi classics, film noir classics, and so on.
I:885;1338;"Yet the twists and plot developments are unique in their own right
I:885;1339;Because of this, Dark City can be enjoyed simply as a piece of entertainment, while at the same time connoisseurs can enjoy a more cerebral challenge.
I:885;1340;Not all scifi fans will enjoy this movie!
I:885;1341;But those who don't mind having their brain cells stimulated are likely to enjoy this.
I:885;1342;I was surprised to read the editorial review at the top.
I:885;1343;The idea itself behind this movie is enough to make it interesting.
I:885;1344;It is a weird but interesting story.
I:885;1345;This movie has an original plot that is reminiscent of film noir with it's dark scenes and crime background.
I:885;1346;fi movies should see this one.
I:885;1347;My childhood moments paint a brilliant picture, but I am left alone in the dark.
I:885;1348;The movie is well directed and the story is original and very interesting.
I:885;1349;First let me say I did enjoy this movie .
I:885;1350;it was entertaining if you accept it for what it is.
I:885;1351;I read a number of reviews saying this movie was superior to The Matrix, which came out a year later.
I:885;1352;The Matrix presented a slick, high tech fantasy world filled with ultra cool people and it had great, cutting.
I:885;1353;edge (at the time) special effects.
I:885;1354;Dark City is basically a film noir and that aspect of it I liked, but then it mixes in a sci.
I:885;1355;William Hurt is very good as the police detective but Keifer Sutherland's character comes across like a spoof of a mad scientist including a strange, stuttering voice.
I:885;1356;this version was worth the wait, despite the special features being disappointing.
I:885;1357;It generally has a sharpened look with sometimes obvious halos and faces often look waxy due to grain filtering.
I:885;1358;It's overall ok and quite watchable.
I:885;1359;The first time I saw this, I figured out most of it before the mystery was solved (but I usually read further ahead than most people), so I cant say it is particularly brilliant, but I enjoyed it.
I:885;1360;Dark City is a combo of Metropolis and Kafka: it sheds its skin and repeatedly reincarnates.
I:885;1361;Sewell sports noir to match director Alex Proyas's relentless gloom and stunning visual intrigue.
I:885;1362;it begins good and ends satisfying.
I:885;1363;its about this men who stop time and rearrange the city like people playing with dolls and one man finds this out as he goes and trys to find the truth and that is that hes in space in a made up place.
I:885;1364;Alex Proyas makes another great science fiction movie alongside his 1994 classic The Crow .
I:885;1365;the end where Sewell gets all the superpowers is great.
I:885;1366;Sutherland is wacky as the doc and Connelley has never been so gorgeous.
I:885;1367;Dark City was a refreshing and brilliant movie that really had me in awe.
I:885;1368;"This is a visionary experience that shouldn't be missed
I:885;1369;this film cleverly mixes sci.
I:885;1370;fi with film noir and pays off by telling us a magnificent story and showing us the most stunning visuals that special effects has to offer us.
I:885;1371;altering and surprising that you really can't comprehend what you are watching.
I:885;1372;This film is also very fast.
I:885;1373;paced, but the length of the movie is perfect.
I:885;1374;The acting was outstanding and really enriched the movie.
I:885;1375;It was also brilliantly written and directed.
I:885;1376;I know that Roger Ebert absolutely loved this film, but he was the only critic I heart talk about this movie.
I:885;1377;It's up to us to make sure that this movie gets all the recognition that it deserves.
I:885;1378;Dark City is a wonderful film that really opens the imagination.
I:885;1379;This is a movie that shows us movies can still be creative, yet loaded with special effects.
I:885;1380;This is a great film and I look forward into watching it again very soon.
I:885;1381;classic with fans of Sci.
I:885;1382;and for the most part, it delivers.
I:885;1383;The pacing is good, and plot development proceeds nicely for the most part, although the end may not be terribly satisfying to fans of films like Blade Runner, with which Dark City has been compared.
I:885;1384;William Hurt and Ian Richardson are the real standout players, and Richardson in particular does a brilliant job of delivering some pretty silly lines and making them sound not only serious, but dark and forboding.
I:885;1385;Most of the supporting cast deliver similarly strong performances.
I:885;1386;Rufus Sewell is a classic Hollywood pretty face.
I:885;1387;affected performance reminds me of a high school student attempting to play someone in their 70s.
I:885;1388;and yet despite my complaints I think it's still well worth seeing.
I:885;1389;A good choice to round out an evening of noir Sci.
I:885;1390;fi viewing on a more upbeat note.
I:885;1391;About Jeff Shannon's review of Dark City:I've been a fan of this movie since I first saw it on cable in 1998.
I:885;1392;all provides a completely satisfying sci.
I:885;1393;This is a film best seen more than once .
I:885;1394;"is Dark City ""a triumph of production design?"""
I:885;1395;"If you stop and think about it, no small part of what makes Blade Runner a ""classic"" is a terrific cast which includes Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer."
I:885;1396;"While Dark City doesn't boast that star power, Rufus Sewell, a young Jennifer Connelly, and William Hurt are ""just right"" in their roles."
I:885;1397;"com allows people to write their reviews who have ""precious little heart and soul"" when it comes to recognizing an outstanding example of a genre and giving credit where credit is due."

I:885;1399;ray version enhance the special effects.
I:885;1400;If a film that can be easily watched multiple times just to watch the effects.
I:885;1401;With the addition of the unbalanced doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland, the serious police detective played by the always powerful William Hurt and the confused wife played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly this movie really has a powerful punch.
I:885;1402;This is a testament to how AWESOME this movie is
I:885;1403;minute movie, a two hour and ten minute masterpiece is trying to get out.
I:885;1404;Just as the characters on screen have a sense of vertigo every time they awake, so should the audience.
I:885;1405;You'll get a pretty good idea of what the action scenes feel like.
I:885;1406;Proyas can then concentrate on explicating, in usually subtle ways, the fascinating idea that makes up the core of the film.
I:885;1407;the film's biggest strength, and I'm not the first to point this out, are it's dazzling sets.
I:885;1408;fourths of the leads are solid and watchable.
I:885;1409;Connelly, always watchable if only for her unchallenged beauty, manages confusion and pathos as the wife of a man accused of serial killing.
I:885;1410;I think Sewell's anonymity, at least to my eyes, works well for him.
I:885;1411;This greatly helped the film's suspense.
I:885;1412;"But if you look close, and I mean real close, you'll see that ""Dark City"" is indeed a flawed masterpiece, hampered by outside circumstances, desperately trying to bust open its seams and reveal it's true nature."
I:885;1413;"Example of ""outstanding visual effects"": A guy puts a fish in a sink."
I:885;1414;That wins the award for the Single Dumbest Idea in Modern Film.
I:885;1415;Other than that, it's a great movie.
I:885;1416;"coveted ""Best Films of 1998"" category."
I:885;1417;In some ways it feels a bit dated but it's a fun enough piece for sci fi fans with the visuals being the main attraction, I suspect.
I:885;1418;the main character, played by Rufus Sewell, has amnesia, is pursued for murder charges and is trying to figure things about amidst demigod beings also tracking him as there is something very special about him.
I:885;1419;Chosen One anybody?The cast is impressive even if at times they feel underutilized: William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly and Richard O'Brien.
I:885;1420;Inspector Frank Bumstead ( William Hurt) is a skilled cop that never gives up.
I:885;1421;Dark City is one of the best Sci.
I:885;1422;All of the costume and building designs are outstanding.
I:885;1423;Next, the story is extremely original.
I:885;1424;The idea of being able to alter reality, and keep it from an entire city is actually interesting.
I:885;1425;Alex Proyas did a great job with how he worked the characters into the story.
I:885;1426;All the main characters play an important part, and help to further develop the plot.
I:885;1427;Rufuss Sewel was outstanding as John Murdock.
I:885;1428;His determination to find out why he's so special is unreal, and when you find out why the Strangers are targeting him, you will be very surprised.
I:885;1429;Jennifer Connelly is great as John's wife.
I:885;1430;The emotion that she shows is very realistic.
I:885;1431;Nice chemistry between her and Sewell.
I:885;1432;Kiefer Sutherland gave my favorite performance.
I:885;1433;He is the wild scientist that helps The Strangers with their mission.
I:885;1434;William Hurt was great as Frank Brumstead.
I:885;1435;The Strangers themselves were excellent and actually frightening.
I:885;1436;Dark City is one of my favorite films.
I:885;1437;What can I say, I love this movie.
I:885;1438;Alex Proyas has truely brought the vision of this dark land with its ominous overlords to life.
I:885;1439;The script and story line were perfect, and the acting talent delivered it flawlessly.
I:885;1440;Kiefer Sutherland played the perfect mad doctor and William Hurt was just eccentric enough to bring the odd detective to life.
I:885;1441;THE REASON i got into acting, Peo0PLE!
I:885;1442;"When i got done watching this movie years ago, way before people knew who she was, knew her as a ""house hold name"" I said to my friends that acctress is going to win the academy award someday."
I:885;1443;winner of teh academya ward for A beautiful Mind from one of my favorite diretcors ron Howard.
I:885;1444;So if you wnt to be an actor (or actress) watch this movie and be moved by teh newances of Jennifer C. as Emma Murdock.
I:885;1445;One man shines as a beam of hope for the victimized humans, but only another man can show him the way.
I:885;1446;"Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, the miracle man with the ability to ""tune"" the world around him the same way ""The Strangers"" do, and who has suddenly become aware that something about his world is just not right."
I:885;1447;fi film noir at its best.
I:885;1448;"Rufus Sewell is excellent in the lead role, but Kiefer Sutherland is the man that steals the show with his creepy portrayal of a ""Peter Lorre meets Claude Rains"" scientist walking the line between good and evil."
I:885;1449;Jennifer Connelly, back when she looked more stunning than weary, is fantastic as the sultry nightclub singer who holds the glazed look of someone unfamiliar with her own life.
I:885;1450;William Hurt is equally superb as a man thrust into the role of a classic noir detective trying to figure out what is real and what is madness, even from the mouth of his now disturbed partner, played wonderfully by Colin Friels.
I:885;1451;The filmmakers have done a wonderful job here of blending various 20th century decades to create a world that seems very familiar, but somehow is not.
I:885;1452;This film on its own is a work of art that belongs in every film buff's library!
I:885;1453;This movie is one of the most under.
I:885;1454;rated films I have seen in awhile.
I:885;1455;This film bursts with creativity.
I:885;1456;In The Matrix the world around you is a fabrication, in Dark City you are the fabrication.
I:885;1457;While I love The Matrix, it is first and foremost and action thriller.
I:885;1458;Dark City is a cerebral work , the implications of its ideas are fascinating, thrilling, sad and frightening.
I:885;1459;The film does what the best science fiction should be able to do, it provides us with an entirely new world.
I:885;1460;Perhaps the best Science Fiction film I've ever seen, but can you handle it?
I:885;1461;This is a very cool film.
I:885;1462;A dreamlike movie with it's story of amnesia and surreal set design.
I:885;1463;It can get a bit confusing at times, but I thought it was a very bold attempt that succeeds on many levels.
I:885;1464;A director's cut that actually improves on the original!The 1998 version of Dark City was a fantastic film (apart from the studio enforced opening narration), very inventive plot with lots of good 'reveals' throughout, also, the cuts were very fast (I don't think a single 'shot' lasted longer than five seconds) which propelled the story along at a blistering pace.
I:885;1465;the new edit has an improved 5.1 soundtrack and the re.
I:885;1466;The picture has also had a major clean up that reveals plot as well as detail.
I:885;1467;But in this movie, just like The Lost Boys, he finds the character that fits his personality.

I:885;1469;When you first put it in you hear something .
I:885;1470;wow I thought I was going crazy until I read the reviews and other articles on the internet.
I:885;1471;The story, the cast, the movie and the musics are all a masterpiece.
I:885;1472;There are a lot things to talk about the movie.
I:885;1473;It is not boring, rather it is delicate and deliberate in every sense.
I:885;1474;Ahh the good old days.
I:885;1475;I love this movie and its very hard to find.
I:885;1476;It was really nice to watch it in like 1 point 2 seconds on Amazon.
I:885;1477;fi noir features a great cast, striking, dreamlike visuals, and plays out like a nihilistic nightmare.
I:885;1478;Dark City is one of the great sci.
I:885;1479;It has a great plot with a twist that modern movies seem to copy, great acting, and great visuals for its time.
I:885;1480;style movies, or Keifer Sutherland, give this movie a shot!
I:885;1481;Alex Proyas, the man who brought us the movie adaption of The Crow (the first and only good one), returns with his latest incarnation, the fantastic Dark City.
I:885;1482;Alex Proyas has a very vivid sense of direction, the sets and cinematography are like none I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention the storyline was the most original story at it's time (The Matrix takes a page from it), add that to great performances from Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, and William Hurt, and you have a very special movie that only comes along not very often.
I:885;1483;The special effects are a very nice touch too and add to the experience even more.
I:885;1484;In my view Dark City is the greatest sci.
I:885;1485;fi movie ever made, it beats The Matrix, Star Wars, Star Trek, and every sci.
I:885;1486;fi franchise in great measure.
I:885;1487;The ending will haunt you for a while and leave you breathless when the climax unfolds.
I:885;1488;fi classic that should be seen by everyone whether they love sci.
I:885;1489;Thank you Alex Proyas for making a truly legendary film.
I:885;1490;This movie it a trip!
I:885;1491;If your feeling crazy though and throwing around money is cool with you, hey, take a chance on this, it's a good film.
I:885;1492;so kind of a movie.
I:885;1493;One of the most pervasive cinematic formulas is film noir.
I:885;1494;There's something intriguing about a dark urban landscape, about characters who pose and speak profoundly, about plots that always involve murder and mystery, and of course, about beautiful women.
I:885;1495;I think Dark City also shows that science fiction captures the imagination much like noir.
I:885;1496;It's rare for a film to be working on so many levels.
I:885;1497;"if you aren't interested in the genres Dark City is working with, you might be missing a good chunk of the film, but you could still enjoy the variation on the ""last man alive"" plot."
I:885;1498;The movie does an excellent job of placing the viewer in the position of the protagonist.
I:885;1499;my only complaint is that Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the mad scientist is a bit over the top.
I:885;1500;Dark City is a movie that takes place, sometime in the future.
I:885;1501;The most important thing everyone should consider while watching this movie is .
I:885;1502;Nonetheless, watch Dark City and enjoy its great story and superb filming.
I:885;1503;A good antihero who is given the opportunity of a lifetime.
I:885;1504;For the me, the strongest thing this film has going for it is it unique setting.
I:885;1505;ish) with the new (future.
I:885;1506;for the most part, the script is strong.
I:885;1507;MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSIt's intriguing to watch the nostalgic city transform and its citizens switch roles.
I:885;1508;William Hurt's performance is spot on.
I:885;1509;fi part of the story is okay, and Kiefer Sutherland's speaking is a bit distracting, but all in all Dark City is entertaining.
I:885;1510;First, I LOVE the sets and the visual effects .
I:885;1511;feel free to watch it with the lights out and a lightening storm outside.
I:885;1512;I rarely give anything 5 stars, reserving taht for the truly spectacular, the things I would give as gifts or put on a top ten list.
I:885;1513;The intracacies of plot and character, is stupendous and theset designs are amazing.
I:885;1514;William Hurt does an amazing job as someone who doesn't believe and then comes to both believe and understand.
I:885;1515;What and who everyone is, and ultimately where they even are is a truly magnificent tale.
I:885;1516;perfect film deftly blends a fusion of times and genres into a spellbinding movie.
I:885;1517;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the unusual and unique and with lot in.
I:885;1518;This movie came out before the Matrix and is better than the Matrix.
I:885;1519;It has some similar ideas and is a very symbolic movie in a dark Noir Environment.
I:885;1520;This movie is also much more emotionally powerful and engrossing.
I:885;1521;In Dark City, Alex Proyas conjoins Ridley Scott's vision of Blade Runner with his own saga of The Crow to present clearly the greatest movie ever made.
I:885;1522;From the opening sequence of a world falling asleep to the final apocalyptic battle and aftermath (a visual parallel to the Biblical story of Revelation), the movie is sheer greatness.
I:885;1523;In short, an entertaining, dark, poetic vision of human plight with a heavy concentration of questioning of established beliefs.
I:885;1524;fi movie that stays with you, years after you first saw it.
I:885;1525;"But other movies are still clear in my mind, like ""Blade Runner"", or the first ""Alien""."
I:885;1526;Dark City definitely belongs to this second category.
I:885;1527;The movie is a visual delight.
I:885;1528;It's the kind of movie that draws you in, lets you experience its world on a very physical level.
I:885;1529;The level of detail that director Alex Proyas packed into each scene is stunning.
I:885;1530;Proyas is known for his attention to visual detail.
I:885;1531;"His more famous (though not half as good) movie ""The Crow"" was another example of fanatic attention to detail."
I:885;1532;"Fortunately, ""Dark City"" has an excellent soundtrack."
I:885;1533;Anita Kelsey's smoky voice is perfect for that noir feel.
I:885;1534;rufus Sewell is excellent as Jack Murdoch, the amnesiac who wanders through the dark city, trying to figure it out.
I:885;1535;William Hurt is the perfect 40's style detective.
I:885;1536;realistic, like a vision of film noir seen through alien eyes.
I:885;1537;The Matrix ripped this movie off, but this movie has much more style and heart.
I:885;1538;If you like NOIR style, then this is for you.
I:885;1539;sLEEEEEP!Kiefer Sutherland delivers his usual low.
I:885;1540;real fun movie (he says tongue.
I:885;1541;He has to be one of the poorest casting choices ever made.
I:885;1542;fi film that presents some utterly stunning and unforgettable imagery.
I:885;1543;A decent script, but at times it feels that it's held together only by the force of the actors who bring it to believable, forceful life.
I:885;1544;I love the dark brooding feel of this movie and it was one of my favorites as a kid.
I:885;1545;Cool plot and great characters.
I:885;1546;Thought this movie was great!
I:885;1547;I thought the acting was great and the plot was strange enough to make it interesting without going overboard.
I:885;1548;Good to sse this come out in a director's cut.
I:885;1549;This is a great movie.

I:885;1556;fi story with wonderful performances by Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland.
I:885;1557;alex Proyas directs a suspenseful story on the meaning of reality in a dark, foreboding dream world.
I:885;1558;Fleeing the crime scene, he finds himself pursued by not only the police, but also a mysterious cabal of cloaked men.
I:885;1559;the feature actors all give strong performances, as a confused Murdoch and a supportive Jennifer Connelly as Emma.
I:885;1560;Keifer Sutherland is impressive, especially when you contrast the cowardly Dr. Scheber vs. his characters from The Lost Boys or 24.
I:885;1561;The sets are as compelling as the actors, and credit is due for the deliberate retro look of the city.
I:885;1562;Making of movie of this style look creative guts, and it paid off.
I:885;1563;either way, I really wanted to see it again and again.
I:885;1564;In a city covered in perpetual darkness a group of strange beings known as The Strangers attempt to understand what makes us human and identify what the soul is.
I:885;1565;These strangers change the city and erase peoples memories and assign them all new lives, but one of their specimens also has this unique power.
I:885;1566;Roger Ebert called it the best movie of 98.

I:885;1568;Schreber knows that Murdoch (Sewell) has the ability to tune where he can change things around him by concentrating.
I:885;1569;The strangers also have this power and use it to change the city and imprint the inhabitants with all knew lives to see what makes us tick.
I:885;1570;But they must first take care of Murdoch who they in the process of imprinting with the life of a serial killer.
I:885;1571;dark City is a movie that's hard to forget, not only for its visuals but its great story and acting.
I:885;1572;Proyas delivers visuals with a flare and style all his own.
I:885;1573;Proyas and his writing team also delivered an original and brilliant story.
I:885;1574;Throw all those elements together into an exhilarating comic book type flick and you have Dark City.
I:885;1575;what you've heard about this flick is true.
I:885;1576;A brilliant and beautiful film that you won't soon forget.
I:885;1577;Its a film about what makes us human.
I:885;1578;Although we are surrounded by darkness, the human spirit will triumph and that's just what Dark City is.
I:885;1579;dimensional, (I mean Keanu Reeves wasn't exactly Gielgud in Matrix), because the dark vibe of the film is compelling.
I:885;1580;Sure, a lot of the performances (by Hurt and Sutherland especially) are mannered and actorly, but that actually works well with the general otherwordliness of the movie.
I:885;1581;How can a movie with a story like this possibly even warrant a good grade?Well, Dark City does, and it does so with ease, thanks to the visionary directing of Alex Proyas, the art style, some fine performances, and execution.
I:885;1582;Director Alex Proyas was responsible for that turd Knowing, but I always thought that the directing was very good in a sense.
I:885;1583;however, Dark City really elevates itself to it's execution, from it's acting to it's sound, and most of all, it's visual style.
I:885;1584;The acting is reasonable as it makes the characters believable and somewhat likeable even though they don't develop much (but actually works because of the plot), but it's the two senses that make Dark City a great movie to behold (inspired by German Expressionalist Films) Borrowing from such movies as Metropolis (1927) (though I really can't see much of the influence of M and Nosferatu, to be honest).
I:885;1585;A special note is the effects, which are great to see.
I:885;1586;Dark City may not have many mindblowing secrets, but it sure is a place worth visiting again and again.
I:885;1587;It also adds fifteen minutes of footage to the movie (and movies) Whether or not you get the director's cut or not, the trip to Dark City is worth it.
I:885;1588;Dark City combines stunning imagery and an incredibly imaginative script with absolutely awesome sets.
I:885;1589;The acting by everyone is superb.
I:885;1590;This is a definatey film you'll want to keep.
I:885;1591;Dark City is a wholly unique world with its own visual eccentricities, emotional archetypes, and a twisted set of repressive rules.
I:885;1592;this movie is true science fiction in that it posits a technology and attempts to explain how humans would react to that technology and the totalitarian world created by the effects of its use.
I:885;1593;Yet, to me, the revelation of what is actually happening to the characters is what sets it apart.
I:885;1594;"keifer Sutherland is brilliant as the twitchy doctor who helps perpetrate the mining of human minds for the ""Strangers"", but who, ultimately proves all too human."
I:885;1595;the final shot of that world makes clear what the movie is all about.
I:885;1596;When Empire Strikes Back is the most well.
I:885;1597;crafted film of the Star Wars series, yet has the lowest box office, you will understand that many people do not want to contemplate how technology and creatures without emotion might affect their world.
I:885;1598;Yes, that's part of the message.
I:885;1599;He defined it as a cult classic.
I:885;1600;I really enjoyed Roger's professional career.
I:885;1601;So when I read his review of the Matrix he mentioned this movie and raved about it.
I:885;1602;The Matrix or for that matter the 5th Element are by far more beautiful to watch with amazing messages for reflection.
I:885;1603;Its great just like the original.
I:885;1604;Just better picture and sound.
I:885;1605;I really enjoy this movie.
I:885;1606;'Dark City' is pure science fiction noir and a visual feast: a gloomy metropolis encrusted with bristling Gothic ornament, redesigned and reinvented in impressive FX sequences night after night.
I:885;1607;It is complicated and mysteriously complex, all to the point where, if you take your eyes of the film for one second, you can get lost.
I:885;1608;Films like Dark City are the pinnacles of imagination and visual style.you look at them and wonder, how any human being could possibly create such breathtaking scenarios and stories.
I:885;1609;This film will surprise you with its genius.
I:885;1610;This is simply one of the best films ever made.
I:885;1611;The more you watch it, the more you'll appreciate the detail put into every scene.
I:885;1612;Everything about this movie is great .
I:885;1613;the style, cinematography, acting, plot, script .
I:885;1614;This movie is awesome and awe.
I:885;1615;Watch the Director's Cut, watch the story unfold with John, and have a wonderful ride!
I:885;1616;It's the movie that, if you see it more than a decade after it came out, makes you re.
I:885;1617;one of the best sci.
I:885;1618;great story with some surprise plot twists.
I:885;1619;for anyone who likes good sci.
I:885;1620;theatrical Viewing:This it the greatest film I've seen.
I:885;1621;I experienced it the first week it came out in the theater, and on my way home was filled with giggling, weeping, and joy .
I:885;1622;I was so happy Proyas hadn't compromised his artistic instinct enough to destroy such a vision.
I:885;1623;The rushed, abbreviated version was a truly great achievement, but this a mind.
I:885;1624;It had that elegance before it was tampered with.
I:885;1625;A true triumph of Science.
I:885;1626;The love everyone involved in this project had for it is evident in every splendid scene.
I:885;1627;For fans of intelligent fantasy, it would be difficult to over.
I:885;1628;recommend this dark, disturbing trip.
I:885;1629;The mystery unfolds gradually, continually surprises.
I:885;1630;Way back when, I liked Hurt in BODY HEAT, thinking he played a pretty good pretty boy/dupe, in kinda the same way I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger did a pretty good acting job as a robot in THE TERMINATOR (only to realize from subsequent films that he always acted that way).
I:885;1631;Painfully bad movies (thanks largely to Hurt) like THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST are bafflingly considered to be good.
I:885;1632;take a good look at William Hurt people .
I:885;1633;Ok, I have an excellent system, new Sony Blu Ray, Onkyo amplifier and a Vizio TV.
I:885;1634;This movie has a good premise and an excellent set, but crappy writing!
I:885;1635;The movie felt more like a trailer.
I:885;1636;rated, that sums it up!
I:885;1637;I like the old movies and I watch as many as I can.
I:885;1638;That is why I joined Amazon Prime, the variety of shows and movies will ensure me of have a pleasurable viewing experience.
I:885;1639;I saw the original and in the director's cut, they cut the most important scene.
I:885;1640;Though I am a huge fan of the genre, it is extremely rare when it is well done.
I:885;1641;It seems that Blade Runner, with about the same two or three soundstages, created a world far more unique and captivating.
I:885;1642;This story had a great influence on the Matrix, but it developed unnaturally fast even to be comic book plausable.
I:885;1643;This is truly one of the best sci.
I:885;1644;The background has a familar, yet odd look to it.
I:885;1645;You can see how it must've inspired the Matrix.
I:885;1646;good movie, entertaining cast, should be a cult classic by nowreally has you pulled in to cheering him on
I:885;1647;Very creative futuristic noir Movie!
I:885;1648;Loved everything about it including the way that it looked!
I:885;1649;A bit of a whodunit but told in the most interesting way
I:885;1650;This was a great movie and has become a cult classic .
I:885;1651;I'm not usually much into moody, dark sets and script, but there is a magic in this story that requires that setting much of the time and yet keeps things moving kind of fast too.
I:885;1652;Its an amazing feat to do both at the same time.
I:885;1653;The first time I watched it, the surprises came flying in one after the other and were amazing to watch.
I:885;1654;The surprise was gone on subsequent viewings, but the magic is still there with the human spirit rising above the opposition both literally and figuratively.
I:885;1655;The setting is from the 40's and is well done, but from there it goes all over the place.
I:885;1656;Sutherland is excellent as the doctor, his acting is on a par with Sean Penn.
I:885;1657;Rufus Sewell is very convincing, but who is this masked man?
I:885;1658;Hurt is always very good and he did not disappoint this time.
I:885;1659;I enjoyed it more than Blade Runner.
I:885;1660;"I needed to watch it twice
I:885;1661;The fantastic transforming city is incredible to watch.
I:885;1662;The way this is filmed is mesmerizing.
I:885;1663;I liked the original theatre release better.
I:885;1664;terrific FX and some nice touches (the aliens' names, for example).
I:885;1665;it was good ambience though :.)
I:885;1666;Dark City is a beguiling movie for its first half .
I:885;1667;it's one of those movies that looks great until it hits a point at which it has to start telling its story, one which never quite matches the almost literally absorbing location.
I:885;1668;Dark City is as much a place as a moment frozen in time.
I:885;1669;Daytime memories are invented and inserted by the city's true masters .
I:885;1670;But Sewell proves uncannily immune to the Strangers and their machines.
I:885;1671;The city is the star of the movie, fluid yet consistently beguiling .
I:885;1672;"and most of the juiciest performances belong to ""The Strangers"" and Kiefer Sutherland's mysterious Peter."
I:885;1673;There's always room for improvement otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
I:885;1674;The acting was captivating and the edge of my seat was worn just hoping the strangers would die a terrible death.
I:885;1675;If you see it once, I think you'll be hooked.
I:885;1676;This is a great movie and it's fantastic on blu.
I:885;1677;I've seen a lot of movies and it takes a tremendous achievement in film making for me to say that I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MOVIE!
I:885;1678;, the effects were worthy of an Academy Award.
I:885;1679;Great direction by Proyas (same guy who brought us The Crow) and a terrific script (which, by the way won a Bram Stoker Award).
I:885;1680;You'll love yourself in the morning if you do.
I:885;1681;A good story and the right touch of darkness makes this a favorite to all fans of science fiction.
I:885;1682;Dark City has always been in my top five favorite movies ever since I saw it in the theater.
I:885;1683;Also, the removal of the intro voice over is a welcomed change.
I:885;1684;To all you curious movie goers I will sum up this movie in two simple words for you:Well Done.
I:885;1685;this is a great film to watch, and like all of Alex Proyas's work I know of, it is a very fulfilling story.
I:885;1686;all the actors are well crafted in their roles, and fulfill their acting roles in superb form.
I:885;1687;both visual and ( not in a pretentious manner) literary in a good way.
I:885;1688;I am a fan of David S. Goyer's work and had the pleasure of meeting him in person quite some time ago.
I:885;1689;time favorite movies and finding the Blu.
I:885;1690;ray version made my day!
I:885;1691;I also like the added footage found within the director's edition.
I:885;1692;"If you like suspense and sci/fi then this version of ""Dark City"" comes highly recommended!"
I:885;1693;Excellent story, acting and the Blu.
I:885;1694;I definitely liked it, wasn't the best movie, but was entertained the whole time.
I:885;1695;Its dark atmosphere surrealistic imagery contain murky allusions of dread and foreboding, making a visually stunning treat for the eye.
I:885;1696;The Strangers have the ability to `Tune', shift the shape of any material matter, and Dr. Schreber has discovered that John Murdock has mysteriously developed this ability also.
I:885;1697;fi/fantasy fan will appreciate the atmosphere and spectacular special effects in this edgy, creepy film.
I:885;1698;Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt give excellent performances, Sutherland performing especially well as the lazy.
I:885;1699;eyed, limping, breathless, haggard looking Dr. Schreber.
I:885;1700;With The Strangers all having names like Mr. Book, Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Sleep, Mr. Rain.
I:885;1701;(chuckle)Overall, Dark City is great movie for horror or sci.
I:885;1702;fashioned visualization, interwoven with some nice action scenes and great effects.
I:885;1703;Definitely an epic masterpiece that is over most heads.
I:885;1704;Also I enjoyed the commentary of Roger Ebert, which in itself is quite surreal.
I:885;1705;This is by far one of my favorite sci.
I:885;1706;I even liked this movie more than the matrix.
I:885;1707;I also think that keifer sutherland was brilliant in this movie and I don't care what anyone says.
I:885;1708;"i loved his ""out of breath"" voice."
I:885;1709;if you haven't seen this movie I beg you to see it right now, you'll thank me for it.
I:885;1710;thankfully, this new version omits the voiceover and adds a few other minor edits to restore the director's original vision.
I:885;1711;this underrated movie deserves to become a genre classic.
I:885;1712;"As a more personal creation by writer/producer Proyas than his later ""I, Robot"" and for several outstanding performances, particularly Kiefer Sutherland as the tortured Dr Schreber."
I:885;1713;But this version is PERFECT!
I:885;1714;You can understand all the dialog, the music and background sounds balanced and best of all, the story makes perfect sense now.
I:885;1715;I hold the hope as we see in this film, that somehow the captives will be set free thru coparticipation from above and below.
I:885;1716;"reviewers often consider movie's end as ""happy."
I:885;1717;but creates the past he whats it to be.
I:885;1718;What do The Larry Truman Show , The Matrix , Hypercube and Darkcity hold in common?A twist of new reality!Deforming ones paradigm of the world can make a very interesting storyline.
I:885;1719;Popular science has just begun to explore new dimensions like hypersapce and this makes a very good inspiration for moviewriters.
I:885;1720;Great story, great effects, I wish it had a sequel or something, the spin off could go on for a very long time.
I:885;1721;this is a hugely stylish film with a definite sense of what it wants to look like.
I:885;1722;makes Batman movies seem bright and cheerful in comparison.
I:885;1723;Things are moving so fast, that while one might sympathize with them, we are never given any time to know them.
I:885;1724;As close as we get to peering into any character's inner life is that we do realize that the main character John Murdoch loves his wife.
I:885;1725;All hook and punch in order to get you to go see the movie .
I:885;1726;An hour into it, one yearned for just one long establishing shot, or a bit of dialogue where the camera puts the actors in the same frame for 15 seconds or more.
I:885;1727;there is a great deal to like about this movie, which is a near masterpiece visually.
I:885;1728;you don't need to see a lot of special effects in this highly cerebral tale of realistic terror.
I:885;1729;the psychological fear in the film is far more powerful than anything you actually see, but the two (visual and psychological) exacerbate one another.
I:885;1730;you will be on the edge of your seat through out.
I:885;1731;"length audio commentaries
I:885;1732;Don't let the comparisons with The Matrix fool you, this is a film and genre in its own right, but you will see some parallels once you've seen both movies.
I:885;1733;The film has been more closely tied with the epic Sci.
I:885;1734;well worth the money and a treat for those who love movies that entertain by stimulating the mind.

I:885;1738;If you haven't seen it, you're in for a dazzling treat.
I:885;1739;It is really difficult to do this movie justice in a written review because it is such an amazing piece of work.
I:885;1740;It is also the kind of movie which can be watched again and again and you will still find something new in it every time.
I:885;1741;Visually it is brilliant and very detailed and it is truly impressive how they can show a city submerged in eternal night without it becoming monotonous or too dark to make out the bits and pieces.
I:885;1742;The acting is also very good, with Kiefer Sutherland as my personal favourite in a cast full of very capable actors.
I:885;1743;I particularly found Connellys laid.
I:885;1744;William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead is definetly not far behind though, and does a wonderful job as the lonely accordion.
I:885;1745;At the beginning of the movie there is a voice.
I:885;1746;Nevertheless, this movie is an incredible journey through the heart, soul and mind of the Dark City and some of its inhabitants, and is in my opinion the best movie of 1998.
I:885;1747;"His previous work in ""The Crow"" was excellent, but Dark City really shows his full potential as a director."
I:885;1748;From an aesthetic point of view his attention to detail and utilization of light, shadow, and camera movement is astounding.
I:885;1749;all of the actors give great performances, especially Sewell and a suprisingly amusing Sutherland.
I:885;1750;City of Lost Children had some great visuals, but the goofiness of some of the characters in the film really detracted from the atmosphere and mood.
I:885;1751;The audio commentaries by Proyas and Roger Ebert really help you understand the movie on a higher level and makes you really appreciate the artistry of the film.
I:885;1752;There is the dark, gritty city, film noir all over, with superb costuming and sets.
I:885;1753;You've got mysterious people, who are not us, but are very much like us.
I:885;1754;There's human experimentation, and wriggly.
I:885;1755;There are the bigger artistic/philosophical questions of identity, purpose, and ultimate direction.
I:885;1756;There's all of this and more in Dark City.
I:885;1757;"right away it looked like ""The Marathon Man,"" with stark dark bathroom and the dark apartment beyond."
I:885;1758;"I detected plenty of ""The Matrix,"" with the sets, costuming, and the ubiquity of the ringing phone."
I:885;1759;"There was plenty Blade Runner"" in this film as well, and ""Metropolis."""
I:885;1760;"I got quite a few ""City of Lost Children"" twinges as well, especially the scenes in the lowest parts of the city, on the water."

I:885;1762;fans of Kiefer Sutherland will enjoy his Dr. Schreber character, about as far as could get from the superhard uber.

I:885;1765;Ultimately, the film was satisfying.
I:885;1766;And the film came through on that.
I:885;1767;And the end, it fit too, just right.
I:885;1768;He achieves this using the Strangers' technology.
I:885;1769;The bio information on the crew is a bit more interesting, but is one.
I:885;1770;The set design is interesting, but is a simple collection of drawings.
I:885;1771;bottom line: This is a film I enjoyed very much, and will add to my personal collection.
I:885;1772;Pretty good movie, great cinematography etc, but I think the plot is a bit of a stretch.
I:885;1773;Pros: Talented actors, great story (Matrix before there was a Matrix by several years)Cons: Worst performance of Kiefer Sutherland, very dark, a bit low budgetI really liked this movie when I first saw it, years before the Matirx came out.
I:885;1774;I'd recommend this movie, but keep in mind, it was panned when it first came out, though seems to be liked by many.
I:885;1775;the heavy use of practical effects and miniatures help create abelievable world.
I:885;1776;It looked like a million bucks, had outstanding art direction, set design, and special effects.
I:885;1777;The fact that the plot unfolds in front of you gradually in this film.
I:885;1778;Alex Proyas made a winner in this movie.
I:885;1779;It does so by allowing you to realize this as John Murdock, the main character, does.
I:885;1780;I just see this one aspect as limiting compared to Dark City).
I:885;1781;the acting is superb all around.
I:885;1782;The special effects are very impressive for its time, especially with the budget they had to work with.
I:885;1783;The script is unique and very well laid out.
I:885;1784;All in all this is an excelling science fiction film that plays out like a mystery and holds onto you until the finish.
I:885;1785;The big bonus feature back then was the director's commentary and it's still the sign of a good special edition.
I:885;1786;Alex and the production team go into some real fine detail on the movie which makes the commentary that much more special.
I:885;1787;You also get a commentary from Roger Ebert that feels more like an analysis, but is actually a good analysis.
I:885;1788;this is where I discovered Jennifer Connelly and thought her so beautiful.
I:885;1789;Keifer Sutherland plays his part beautifully.
I:885;1790;the villains are odd and interesting.
I:885;1791;if you like science fiction you'll probably enjoy it.
I:885;1792;Masterpiece Science Fiction whose incredible inspirationalism and spirituality make it also a Drama in esscence if not in definition, and whose darkness and terrifying concepts make it also a Horror movie in esscence if not in definition.
I:885;1793;wise, vulnerable but utterly radiating her usual air of class, sensuality, intellect, beauty, and 'niceness'.
I:885;1794;One of the most essential Science Fiction movies, an all.
I:885;1795;time great of storytelling and film.
I:885;1796;fi mysteries, then this is worth a look.
I:885;1797;Loved Kiefer Sutherland's mad doctor character, helping the aliens' experiments with human subjects by rearranging their memories and the shape of the city landscape nightly.
I:885;1798;The transfer looks phenomenal (compared to how I saw it prior .
I:885;1799;"Virtually every frame looked excellent, especially the scenes with Jennifer Connelly singing
I:885;1800;a worthwhile Blu addition and I did not see too many failings in the grain reduction/transfer issues I had read about.
I:885;1801;We all truly enjoyed this movie!
I:885;1802;After sleeping on it for the weekend, I finally came to the conclusion that this movie was indeed a triumph.
I:885;1803;I do not agree with Roger Ebert that Dark City was the best movie of 1998, but I do admire director Alex Proyas' efforts to dare the audience to actually use their brains.
I:885;1804;ambitious ideas that force us to question the very nature of reality.
I:885;1805;Dark City also functions as an exciting movie in its right by combining the best elements of sci.
I:885;1806;fi and film noir into an engrossing mystery.
I:885;1807;Released in 1998, Dark City is a stylish noirish delight.
I:885;1808;for a start its visually stunning, considering its limited budget relative to its thematic cousin The Matrix, released a year later, and, since it appears to be permanently night, appropriately noirish.
I:885;1809;like Mr Hand, renders the film a visual treat.
I:885;1810;I guess you could say 'The Matrix' got its inspiration from this movie.
I:885;1811;An interesting movie to say the least.
I:885;1812;Very weird and has a rather satisfying ending.
I:885;1813;Try to spot the changes.
I:885;1814;Also, great movie only greater on the Blu!
I:885;1815;fi this is a must.
I:885;1816;I injoy this film and the way the story unfolds, right till the end.
I:885;1817;I gave this movie one star for the incredibly freaky, yet artistic setting of the movie.
I:885;1818;In short, this dedicated and eclectice sci fi enthusiast says this is one of the BEST movies of all time, and Keifer Sutherland steals the show.
I:885;1819;On many levels, a stunning movie, which deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the best science fiction ever.
I:885;1820;It keeps you guessing and wondering the entire time and you hope for a payoff in the end, and it delivers in ways few films do.
I:885;1821;I have to say I loved the direction and the movement of the film.
I:885;1822;Rufus Sewell is very good as the main character John Murdoch.
I:885;1823;William Hurt is fine as the inspector and Jennifer Connelly I thought gave her best performance ever.
I:885;1824;After another viewing, I came to enjoy his performance.
I:885;1825;This movie is an intelligent movie and not for someone who likes to be barraged with pure action.
I:885;1826;Already a cult favorite, it will be so much more than that in the years to come.
I:885;1827;The sound is gloriously full and weighty.
I:885;1828;The corresponding picture is beautifully rendered.
I:885;1829;The many shades of brown that form the color scheme of the city are painstakingly laid out for the eye.
I:885;1830;mr. Proyas' vision, as manifest on the screen is quite magnificent.
I:885;1831;The story is layered, so that the audience believes it is watching a routine but quirky film noir who.
I:885;1832;Underneath there is a much deeper and complex story that questions our very definition of reality.
I:885;1833;Copying Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil or Fritz Lang's ambitious Metropolis to add legitimacy, throw in something retro like brimmed fedoras or giant gothic buildings hundreds of stories high.5.
I:885;1834;Make damn sure she's sultry.
I:885;1835;Though blondes are generally more popular these days in Hollywood, here dark brunettes work best.
I:885;1836;Our hero should have had, if possible, a happy childhood that turned tragic.
I:885;1837;metropolis, Caligari, even Frankenstein will do nicely.
I:885;1838;In The Matrix, the explanation for what was going on was a lot more convincing and practical.
I:885;1839;Some viewers of Dark City may be confused during the first half hour or so of the film, as it is not clear what is going on, as well as being turned off by the dark Gothic imagery, but it is worth sticking with to the end, when Murdoch realizes who he is and what he is capable of.
I:885;1840;The creation scene is visually stunning and contains a beautiful background score.
I:885;1841;dark City borrows heavily from other sources (the Gothic imagery, the fim noir atmosphere) but manages to repackage it into something fresh and new.
I:885;1842;It is definitely worth seeing, particularly for sci.
I:885;1843;Interesting to see Jennifer Connelly at a young age.
I:885;1844;Instead, you will find an interesting, imaginative dark tale that slowly unfolds like a mystery.
I:885;1845;I enjoyed the imagination, and the soul behind it.
I:885;1846;What is first evident upon watching Dark City is that it is one of the coolest looking films ever concieved, a monumental achievement in production design.
I:885;1847;The film blends science fiction and film noir so seamlessly that they become one and the same, a new category unto itself.
I:885;1848;In my opinion, the film is worth watching based on its visual merits alone.
I:885;1849;when the elements of Dark City are viewed as a whole the end result is a very good film that succeeds in exploring such issues as free will, perception vs. reality, and the human spirit.
I:885;1850;Kudos for having both theatrical and directors cut on the same blu.
I:885;1851;This is an unusual film.

I:885;1855;A fine film, and one worth a repeat viewing now and again.
I:885;1856;Dark City is the best example I've ever seen of bringing a comic book sensibility to the big screen.
I:885;1857;the look of the film is tremendous.
I:885;1858;It's a highly stylized, art.
I:885;1859;And the effects are well.
I:885;1860;Add in a murder mystery, and you've got yourself an alternate reality worthy of exploration.
I:885;1861;the performances are uniformly good, if a little mannered.
I:885;1862;He's creepy and belongs completely to the world of the film.
I:885;1863;if you surrender to the conceit of the film, you'll enjoy this immensely.

I:885;1873;This is a very well done film from an art direction standpoint and I would not doubt that it has influenced others.
I:885;1874;Good movie and Im super glad to add it to my collection.
I:885;1875;There are some good special features.
I:885;1876;Great special effects and decent story line.
I:885;1877;An absolutely brilliant and nightmarish movie.
I:885;1878;Dark City is an enriching and surreal experience, full of beautiful images and powerful symbolism.
I:885;1879;The effects are well done and the story will have you captivated.
I:885;1880;What makes you human.Dark City kicks off with a classic film noir premise .
I:885;1881;Yet despite the heavy ideas, Proyas makes it an impressively visual experience, the constant `tuning' of the city proving surprisingly spectacular despite the comparatively modest budget.
I:885;1882;He also shows a truly inspired use of the widescreen space, for once using it not to emphasise width but for depth, emphasising the claustrophobia with interior sets that are narrow and deep, more like corridors or alleys than bedrooms or diners.
I:885;1883;The colour scheme is also surprisingly successful, using a potentially disastrously limited palette of blacks and greys that doesn't fall into the kind of visual clich s of so many derivative orange.
I:885;1884;But more than the technical achievements, he manages to make it an involving and enthralling experience that carries you along even on subsequent viewings when you know the answers.
I:885;1885;office success and with bigger action set pieces, but while this never managed to break out to a mainstream audience it's still an exhilarating experience.

I:885;1893;the plot is NOT compelling.

I:885;1910;It was interesting and I enjoyed the movie.
I:885;1911;A friend recommended this flick.
I:885;1912;I bought it , played it, then played it again.
I:885;1913;Haunting, get it and see if you like it.
I:885;1914;I enjoyed the dreaminess of it.
I:885;1915;The film itself is brilliant with a story that will blow you away.
I:885;1916;One thing I will give away is that they have removed the opening voice.
I:885;1917;over which, together with the music, makes for a tense, eerie opening atmosphere that I liked quite a lot.
I:885;1918;All in all, I much prefer this Director's Cut version to the theatrical release.
I:885;1919;Mr. Proyas says in the special features interview that this version represents more closely what his original vision was for the film and I think he did an excellent job.

I:885;1923;While it didn't catch on at the box office the same way, it did earn critical raves including Roger Ebert naming it the Best Film of 1998.
I:885;1924;a terrific film gets its due even if the video isn't perfect it looks stunning at times (although there is a signficant amount of edge enhancement througout the film to compensate for the DNR).

I:885;1928;Led by Mr. book (Ian Richardson) and Mr. Hand (Richard O' Brien), the Strangers steal the inhabitant's memories, which they believe contains the human soul, and mix memories around citizens while observing the results.
I:885;1929;But it seems that John, who resisted their attempt to imprint him (give him new memories), can now tune as well.
I:885;1930;And he may also be the champion of humanity, destined to bring about the salvation of mankind.
I:885;1931;The special effects, on the other hand, are spectacular, and are more story.
I:885;1932;"The sense of atmosphere is the best thing about this movie
I:885;1933;It has its thrilling sequences (the final battle is dazzling) as well as its calmer, sensitive moments between John and Emma.
I:885;1934;As for acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent at conveying the disorientation and subsequent understanding that Murdoch goes through.

I:885;1940;This is a gorgeous demo disk with uncompressed 7.1 sound.
I:885;1941;It is the ultimate science fiction/fantasy/horror movie.
I:885;1942;The story is so surreal and so huge that at times my jaw dropped after a humungous explanation.
I:885;1943;The special effects are great, as are the sets, the acting, and the execution.
I:885;1944;This is one of my top ten movies.
I:885;1945;This movie leads the viewer through a maze of incredible imagery.
I:885;1946;The Strangers redesign that city above, every day, in amazing scenes of rubbery, expanding skyscrapers.
I:885;1947;The city below is filled with dark, cavernous spaces and monumental icons of unknown meaning.
I:885;1948;The story has that Kafka feeling about it that is blatantly fictional, but still sounds true to that frightened little voice in the back of the mind.
I:885;1949;All of the past has been changed, switched onto a new track .
I:885;1950;it's quite amazing how, with such a strong start, the movie falters so badly.
I:885;1951;The Strangers never managed to make much sense .
I:885;1952;In the end, the incredible visuals carry the movie.
I:885;1953;i like this one for its imagery and for the Twilight Zone sense of its beginning.
I:885;1954;fi flicks I have yet to watch on NetFlix, I read stunning reviews regarding Dark City.

I:885;1958;If you have friends who say this is better than the Matrix, should should call your local phone company ASAP and have their number blocked.
I:885;1959;Dark City is truly one of the best sci.

I:885;1965;fi fan, but Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head when he proclaimed this the best movie of 1998.
I:885;1966;Some of these screenwriters need to find more inventive ways to end a movie.
I:885;1967;The best way I can describe Dark City is ominous.
I:885;1968;"As other reviewers have mentioned it is stylish with Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt turning in excellent performances, Sutherland's portrail as the erie psychiatrist and his pronouncement of being a ""traitor to his species""."
I:885;1969;the world of Dark City is Fritz Lang's Metropolis meets film noir 40's grit.
I:885;1970;the special effects are beautifully rendered with entire city blocks remaking themselves.
I:885;1971;The existential nihilism is striking.
I:885;1972;The acting is striking because it is convincing.
I:885;1973;William Hurt's sad but stoic detective character is nicely played because he is subtle.
I:885;1974;The main characters do their jobs well to advance the plot.
I:885;1975;But Kiefer Sutherland steals the film every time he is in a scene.
I:885;1976;fi way which is at times brilliant but sometimes hackneyed.
I:885;1977;Still, they are entertaining and the philosophy behind this Kafkaesque story makes one wonder about what reality is.
I:885;1978;Atmospheric, inventive, stylish and sexy but most importantly worth several viewings.
I:885;1979;one of my favorite films.
I:885;1980;This film does an absolutely incredible job of blending science.
I:885;1981;book narrative structure, and noir atmosphere for a spectacular piece of entertainment.

I:885;1984;The mystery and drama blend well in a mix of stunning landscapes, creepy villains (the alien Strangers, who have abducted humans to search their souls.)
I:885;1985;, confused and ambiguous memories, and climactic excitement.
I:885;1986;This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and obviously highly recommended.
I:885;1987;Picture is seamless, sound is superlative.
I:885;1988;See this and find how much the better known movies have stolen.
I:885;1989;The movie examines conditioned experiences expressed through drama as we Co. create.
I:885;1990;This was a very dark film as the title implies, but a surprising one.
I:885;1991;I liked the actors they chose too.
I:885;1992;This was a good sci.
I:885;1993;The sense of isolation and claustrophobia are well conveyed.
I:885;1994;"Rufus Sewell is fantastic in this
I:885;1995;Dark City is an excellent film .
I:885;1996;one of the most interesting in the sci fi genre.
I:885;1997;While the movie suffers in the acting department and there are certain stylistic issues, it is definitely a great movie to watch and a return to good genre film moviemaking that has been missing for quite some time.

I:885;2000;The movie explores what it means to be human and touches on cognition, the individual's relationship to society, psychological illnesses, and genuine human emotion.
I:885;2001;for the rest of us, this movie explores interesting themes in a new way.
I:885;2002;It should keep you watching until the end, and then bring you back another time to really understand it.
I:885;2003;I had an opportunity to watch this interesting film again, which often reminded me how good it is.
I:885;2004;It's a story of a hero whose memories being manipulated by an alien race for their own purposes and how he was able to fight back for his true identity.
I:885;2005;fi film, but it sure is artistically rich in symbolism and themes.
I:885;2006;"And, it has that dark atmosphere as similar to the ""Matrix"" and the ""Crow"" films."
I:885;2007;what I personally liked about this film is the fact that everyone's memories can be manipulated and changed.
I:885;2008;This film can remind one that our memories or our experiences can be contributed to our identities and how easily they can be changed.
I:885;2009;The main reason that we actually trust our memories, our experiences, is because they match with our living situations.
I:885;2010;Indeed, it's quite an extraordinary film in that regard.
I:885;2011;Slowly the story of Dark City is revealed to us.
I:885;2012;But it is definitely worth watching this film to see this secret.
I:885;2013;Its got a very noir tint to it, as well as a comic influence, this film.
I:885;2014;This film brings up many issues about humans, their memories, and soul.
I:885;2015;In the end it will be worth it.
I:885;2016;They are very insightful to the making of films, directing, and what shots mean and are meant to convey.
