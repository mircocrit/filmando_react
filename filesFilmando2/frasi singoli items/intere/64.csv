1;A classic family movie that I never tire of seeing.
2;I would highly recommend it to anyone.
3;Graphics may seen a bit dated by today's standards, but still very good.
4;A nice family friendly movie that bother kids and adults will enjoy.
5;Also a great way for kids to move up from the movies like strawberry shortcake.
6;diesel's best performance to date, and one of the most beautiful endings to any movie ever made.
7;The Iron Giant will go down in history as one of the best animated film in the latter half of the 20th century.
8;With beautiful animation and powerful storytelling, director Brad Bird and his team create a tale that will resound not just with children, but the whole family.
9;I have just loved The Iron Giant after seeing it in theatres 5 years ago.
10;With it's heart, wit and engrossing story, it far surpasses anything to come out of Disney or Dreamworks.
11;this kid finds a gigantic iron giant in this one.
12;but has to keep it a secret.
13;This movie is one of the best I have ever seen.
14;It's going to be GREAT, and the cover art is incredible.
15;*THIS is the kind of homegrown animated feature film American audiences have been waiting decades for!
16;varying ''Disney Standard'' with their own ''in house'' productions and choosing, instead, to merely acquire the American rights to popular established Japanese anime features like ''Mononoke Hime.''
17;Warner's ''THE IRON GIANT,'' by contrast, breaks with the tired and worn American tradition and presents a very beautiful animated feature with a very beautiful story.
18;the animation for ''THE IRON GIANT'' still reflects a strong American artistic style .
19;"But as the story unfolds it immediately begins to sink in that this is NOT some typicical ''kiddie cartoon'' movie
20;Also, the marriage of traditional ''cel animation'' with ''CGI,'' as used in this film, flows very smoothly and believably .
21;(Rintarou's ''METROPOLIS'' is the ultimate example of a ''cel/CGI'' wedding gone bad!)
22;Playing it straighter than most American animated features geared toward a younger audience, ''THE IRON GIANT's'' real beauty is in its storytelling .
23;Not only is it a delight to watch for its warm and touching ''lighthearted'' moments, but it is also a very powerful and thought provoking experience, revisiting some of the old morality play standards such as friendship, acceptance, personal responsibility, and the freedom to decide one's own life course.
24;Kent Mansley, a fiery and relentless ''Commiephobe'' is dispatched by Washington to investigate and eventually comes to suspect.
25;theme (just go with it), the entire movie plays out very well, right down to its heroic, tear.
26;''THE IRON GIANT'' would, without question, be one of my first picks for a ''Top Ten'' favorite movies of all time list (.
27;My only regret is that I never got the chance to see it on the big screen when it played in theatres.
28;simultaneously humorous and dramic, I strongly recommend ''THE IRON GIANT'' for adults as well as for its younger target demographic.
29;it has to do with the writing.
30;The script is crisp, smartly.
31;paced, intelligent, and emotionally satisfying.
32;It introduces real, likable characters worth caring about and rooting for.
33;It's the kind of story with the power to engross 6.
34;The filmmakers responsible for The Iron Giant, particularly director Brad Bird, recognize that the best animated features appeal to a wide variety of audience members, not just the pre.
35;In fact, there's a good possibility that you've never even heard of it before now.
36;presented tale of a boy and his robot, and the power of friendship.
37;Easily one of the five best animated films in the last 20 years.
38;Iron Giant is a modern fairy tale that will delight and entrance everyone from age 10 to 100!
39;This is a surefire hit!
40;my kids love the film.
41;The Iron Giant is easily my favorite movie of 1999.
42;Be that as it may, it stands firm as a shining example of the limitless potential of animated storytelling.
43;full of nostalgic nuance and attention to detail, The Iron Giant tells the story of a young boy, Hogarth Hughes, and his adventures with a new and unlikely best friend.
44;As the giant struggles to understand who he is and Hogarth struggles to conceal the giant, both end up learning more than a little bit about true friendship.
45;The anthropomorphism of the Giant is remarkable.
46;he is very humanlike, and easy to feel for.
47;notch, with a nice retro feel.
48;The computer animated Iron Giant merits mention as well.
49;it's a wonderful film, albeit a tad predictable, and sometimes the message is pretty blatant.
50;in telling my friends about this gem, it's hard not to choke up in remembering some of the more touching scenes .
51;Hogarth telling the Robot I love you is one of the most powerful cinematic moments I've ever experienced.
52;for my money, Iron Giant should win the Oscar for best film of 1999.
53;A great movie for all ages.
54;Your children, or inner child, will relate to the excitement and wonderment of playing with a 70 foot tall robot.
55;This is one of those masterpiece films that for some reason never ever got the recognition it deserved.
56;The story is well told and the characters are very easy to relate to.
57;As an adult I STILL appreciate this film for what it is.
58;The plot offers such sweet irony you don't get from any other animated movies.
59;lately, not even Disney can craft a story so touching.
60;This is a family favorite, well loved movie.
61;Great story and animation in this one.
62;This one is just like the honest movies they used to make, with a good story that touches your hearts.
63;My 6 year old loves it, I love it.
64;I wanted to see this movie at theaters when it was first released because, it got generally favorable reviews.
65;Excellent transformation sequence towards the end which would put The Transformers to shame.
66;This should appeal to all ages who are young at heart because, it appeals to our forgotten childhood innocence.
67;brad Bird does a great job with the writting and directing.
68;a classic to always remember in movies.
69;I have read all the 69 previews I found here.
70;But Warners is taking it's first steps in full.
71;length animation and of course quite eager to make a name for itself at the market.
72;Warner is ready to earn less but make it's presense felt in the market, to back up it's ambitions with something worth mentioning.
73;So the superbly creative team got the adequate funding and now we have this rare gem.
74;a lot of reviewers mention the Cold War relics making the film ring true but I see another All.
75;It's a Western in all it's archetypal splendor!
76;The Iron Giant is laconical, galant with the ladies and children .
77;When you see the great chunk of metal you expect him to creak and limp but what really happens takes your breath away.
78;characterization is above all praise.
79;The people are really alive!
80;Every one of them is worthy of Oscar nomination.
81;They look more real and endearing than the majority of Hollywood's flesh and blood progeny.
82;the movie got the highest rating from my 7.
83;Nevertheless, The Iron Giant is amazingly powerful and very believable.
84;naturally, the government is quite displeased with the robot.
85;This story, on the other hand, has quite a few adult.
86;Both stories interweave quite frequently, so a rather mature.
87;The art is quite grand, and the frequent use of perspective is very effective in conveying the giant's size.
88;The Iron Giant is a great movie with a great message (you are who you choose to be).
89;This movie is fun for the kids and the adults.
90;They have plenty of adult humor and the soundtract is very good in this video.
91;The Iron Giant is the story of a young boy who befriends a great mechanical beast, that is somehow able to learn and feel emotions just like humans.
92;It is refreshing to see an animated movie that actually treats its audience intelligently.
93;As a matter of fact, FORGET THE KIDS: This movie rivals any live.
94;This movie deals some great fantasy themes with some strong realism added.
95;Vin Diesel is GREAT as the voice of the tender Giant.
96;My son who is four years old is obsessed with this movie.
97;This was one of my favorite movies as kid (and even still today).
98;I've actually been looking for this movie and this was honestly the best deal that I could find.
99;I bought this because I had the VHS, so, I bought it and my nieces and nephew LOVED it.
100;i still love this movie no matter how much i watch it, shipping was fast, and the price was good.
101;This is one of those heartwarming animated features you get to see only every now and then.
102;True, the story might be appear to be a children's tale, but it also takes place in a time when the US was suspicious of anything and everything that appears foreign.
103;The Giant is definitely foreign.
104;A government agent soon comes to town asking about any strange occurences that might have happened recently.
105;this film is a touching story of friendship, protection and loyalty.
106;The Giant begins to understand that it can't just go around eating and destroying everything in its way and trusts the boy to do the right thing and keep it safe.
107;Later on, and perhaps in the most touching part of the story, the Giant learns that friendship means protecting the ones we love.
108;i highly recommend this as a family film.
109;There were moments of huge laughter, followed by tears.
110;wonderful life lessons, and kid fun.
111;This wonderful animated classic is based on a children's book by the late British poet laureate, Ted Hughes (who drove two wives to suicide.
112;ups who see this film need know about Hughes, or the Cold War, during which Hughes created this allegory to demonstrate the evil of war.
113;nevertheless, the plot and fantastic cartoon art and music will draw kids and adults alike into this tangle of fantasy.
114;The film, in a way, even reproduces some of the book's poetic language, in pictures.
115;Hughes wrote of the music of the spheres.
116;The film also recreates the wind, which Hughes wrote, sang through his iron fingers, and his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but big as a bedroom, slowly turned right, then slowly turned left.
117;The film does not end the same way as the book, but it's fun, anyway.
118;but one important point, for grown.
119;dragon, the erstwhile pacifist poet Hughes also created a vision of evil incarnate.
120;Within the movie and entertainment business, however, it is highly regarded as one of the best animated films of all time.
121;Such wonderful story, characters, art direction, plot development, and heart.
122;A beautiful tale about a curious, lonely boy who discovers a friend when he's most in need of one.
123;It's about friendship, humanity and the choices that make us who we are.
124;A hardworking single mother, a frustrated yet imaginative young boy, a dreaming artist turned apathetic, a narcissistic and bulldogged CIA agent, and an unexpectedly 'human' robot giant make up this cast of interesting characters.
125;Love this movie and so does both my little ones, absolutely awesome.
126;My 5 year old grandson loves this movie.
127;Whenever he's over he asks for this particular movie.
128;He's watched it a few times.
129;My three year old grandson loves this movie.
130;He's watched it so many times he can narrate the whole thing.
131;He tells us what is happening next in every scene.
132;This film is one of the best!
133;With a strong plot and great animation, this film presents great lessons, wonderful entertainment, and an overall good time.
134;This is an incredible film.
135;The story is flawless, the emotions powerful and honest.
136;This was my daughter's favorite movie when she was a child who is now 14 .
137;I will be able to give her back a small piece of her childhood .
138;The best of all the price was really unexpensive about $4.
139;It really is an excellent movie.
140;As I see it, the underlying message of The Iron Giant is: """"Greater love has no man than to give his life for a friend."""""""
141;"This is probably one of the very best animated films I've seen since the classics of my childhood
142;First of all, its set in a time and a world (Cold War 1957) into which I was born, and it captures that atmosphere flawlessly.
143;It is emotionally true to both the time and the events of that day.
144;I loved this movie so much I saw it three times in the theatres so that I could bring friends and family to see the most wonderful movie ever.
145;feely disney movies or animated movies in general but this was just a great story.
146;Intelligent dialog, great voice acting, great direction, music and all.
147;An excellent movie for the whole family.
148;Love the animation and the characters.
149;It is great when the story gives a message that the kids recognize immediately.
150;This neat little film is a bonafide classic.
151;The characters are both well.
152;drawn and very well performed by a cast of fine actors.
153;moving and sprinkled with lots of subtle and occasionally, suprisingly adult humor.
154;And 'The Iron Giant' has a spectacular and dramatically pleasing climax that is neither too bleak nor too sentimental, which is always a delicate balance to reach.
155;I highly recommend this warm and witty film as a treat for all ages.
156;It crosses the barrier of children's films to become a classic for everyone.
157;I still cry at the end, and it's a cartoon!
158;My 2 year old loves it as much as my 12 year old does.
159;I couldn't give higher praise than that, it's truly for the whole family.
160;Everyone who sees that we have this movie on our Kindle Fire remarks about how this movie is one of the best.
161;I took my 11 year old daughter and 14 year old son to see this movie.
162;My son is at the age where he is starting to sneer at 'kiddie' fare, and was a bit reluctant to come along, but afterwards he couldn't stop raving about the film and how wonderful it was.
163;I was also equally mesmerized, and I liked the subtle adult humor in it as well.
164;It has a sincerity and depth missing in many other children's fare.
165;A timeless work of art that appeals to both children and adults, with the maturity most films of its kind lack.
166;There are better animated movies, but this one isn't horrible.
167;It's a good story and well worth watching more than once.
168;The Iron Giant's highlight is the dramatic and satisfying (though not entirely original) ending.
169;This movie is a classic.
170;My son loved this as a child and still enjoys watching it!
171;It's a Must Watch , in my opinion.
172;Love a story with a moral.
173;This movie has always been a favorite inn my house.
174;My family has watched this movie for years and were excited to see it on Prime for free viewing!
175;Just as good now!So in response to some of the other reviews:""""Not appropriate for small children."""
176;They watched this at around 6.8 and loved it!
177;They are perfectly normal children .
178;the eldest accepted into a very competitive university film program.
179;We thought it showed compassion, understanding and friendship.
180;She is now 18 and she was the one who ordered it because she can not find the old copy.
181;made movie, with a message.
182;by the way, this movie swept the Annie (animation) awards which put it up against Tarzan, Prince of Egypt, A Bug's Life, and Antz.
183;"I remember it being a good movie, and it was definitely a film I enjoyed watching, but I don't recall thinking that it was ""anything special."
184;It is a really great movie!
185;I don't think I could fully appreciate the story when I was a boy, but 10 years later this movie really touched me.
186;the animation is great, the voice actors are pretty good, but what stands out is the wonderful story.
187;written script and has so much heart that I would easily put it in the running for one of the best animated films ever made.
188;An outstanding movie, for adults as well as kids, with a heart as big as the giant himself.
189;This movie perfectly captures the atmosphere of the 50's .
190;"if you liked ""Tin Men"" for the depiction of the times, you MUST see this."
191;Great fun, and something rare these days .
192;"A ""kids"" movie, which adults will want to watch more than once."
193;My son loved this movie as a young boy and watched it on video cassette.
194;My kids love this movie!
195;It teaches kids good morals and is just all.
196;around a great and fun movie!
197;i think of it as a classic.
198;Now that I'm an adult I found it and Hey!
199;I love this movie even more!
200;As a graphic designer and illustrator, I naturally have an eye for any type of creative element.
201;This is something that I share with the people that I work with.
202;A collection of artists and creative types, who share a love for our work and for fine pieces of animation.
203;few films can be defined as great, if not perfect.
204;This film belongs on that list.
205;The animation, color palettes, storyline and characters made this film truly memorable.
206;A fine balance of artistry, technology and storytelling, and at its center, the Iron Giant himself.
207;This film stands out to me as a wonderful example of what can be done both artistically and humanistically.
208;The story, like its characters, are of significant substance and value.
209;Illustrating the need for humanity and compassion both in the arts and life itself.
210;For the Iron Giant himself illustrates the warmth and human love that is needed from all of us.
211;I certainly hope that more people give this film a chance.
212;For it is deserving of our appreciation, respect and memory.
213;For in the end, the key affect of any film is how it makes us think, dwell and appreciate not only the art within the matter, but its heart as well.
214;The whole family can watch.
215;A wonderful and heart warming movie the whole family will watch over and over again.
216;Now I enjoy watching it with my grandson!
217;as always, seeing the world through the eyes of a child, unhindered by pre.
218;All I can stress amonsgt the myriad of reviews is I sincerely hope the animation and production team responsible for this movie bless film.
219;goers with more films like it.
220;This movie is resonant, beautiful, and displays genuine humanity.
221;It's great and part of my collection.
222;This is the best animated work I've seen in a long, long time.
223;"The story is beautiful, encasing a vital life lesson
224;thank you to Brad Bird, his vision and his commendable crew of artists and engineers for this incredible film.
225;Brad Bird's delightful directorial debut is a heartwarming tale of a boy and a gentle giant robot that fell from the sky.
226;The characters feel like real people.
227;The script is hilarious and it has a great message about choice vs destiny.
228;This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
229;Well worth making a part of your permanent collection!
230;I love this flick even more now that my kid enjoys it, too.
231;My 16 year old son had this movie years ago in VHS format and still loves the movie.
232;Fabulous story, plenty for anyone to like, it's just the best.
233;Consider the line by the government investigator who threatens the boy by saying he can do anything to him (and his mom) in the """"people's interest"""", and they can't do anything about it."""
234;It is about an absolutely powerful being, taught to see life through the eyes of a child.
235;wonderful film, best of the best, multiple views, gotta see it!
236;I have seen this over a dozen times, thanks to my toddler who loves it and recites the script as it unfolds.
237;actors inflection, timing, and intonations are absolutely superb, and I love every character, and would not be happy if they were destroyed.
238;Thus, if a production is filled to the brim with indespensable characters, you've done a marvelous job!I watch animation all the time, mostly Japanese, since most American stuff is rubbish.
239;i shed tears at the end of this movie, and am genuinely touched by the endearing moments that are so honestly human in their nuance, simplicity, and tangible ordinarianess.
240;the team who created The Iron Gian did a truly commendable job, and considering my viewing fodder is usually such things as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Hayao Miyazaki films, that is a real compliment (if I do say so myself).
241;This movie is so seamless, well.
242;designed, and perfect that it strikes me as a work of love.
243;This is one of the very best movies I have ever seen, hands down.
244;It is a nice story and rated P for the little ones.
245;My son loves this movie.
246;it shows this giant actually has a sensitive side.
247;one of the best animation movies, as good as any disney movie pree 2000.
248;The Bunny Works has REALLY came a LONG way ever since the last animated film and a very medicore one, King and I .
249;Now this dazzling new movie finally comes up with wonderful, well.
250;developed characters, very professional animation, lots of fast.
251;Yet this mechanical monster turns to be a very gentle creature who is quite full of innocence and love.
252;And along comes a sharp.
253;a great work of art that will win the respect of the collective audience who had been unfortunately conditioned to consider animation as sugar.
254;coated fare for tiny tots.
255;this medium can be a very powerful storyteller as a truly sweeping proof like The Iron Giant will definitely prove!
256;and have been giving it away as gifts ever since I discovered it.
257;Wish I could see it on the big screen .
258;I loved it for its teaching of not judging a book by its cover lesson.
259;My grandson laughed through the whole movie just like his father years ago great kids movie
260;It was a perfect way to get them to settle down and rest for a few minutes.
261;Could be, and the special edition is superb.
262;The picture itself, in widescreen and a new digital transfer, looks better than I have ever seen it on previous releases or television showings.
263;scored montage of animation art, pencil tests and finished scenes, sure to bring a smile to the face of any animation fan.
264;"documentaries"" are as lovely as anything else on the disc."
265;I especially liked hearing from composer Michael Kamen, now sadly deceased.
266;This 'cartoon' comes from some of the minds that would later form Pixar, and it shows!
267;notch voice acting, writing, and art direction.
268;Humorous without feeling cheap, and proves that even an Iron Giant can have a heart.
269;The Iron Giant is a magnificent animated movie about a boy who gets in trouble a lot, and one night while alone because his mother had to work late, he hears strange noises outside and decides to investigate where the sounds are coming from.
270;the movie had some really funny lines, and the story was really good for both children and adults.
271;Some of the animation was a little strange (the voice acting didn't always match up to the moving mouths on the characters) but the storytelling is what matters the most, and the honest emotions and overall enjoyment from the characters made this movie one I highly recommend watching with your children.
272;It is pretty funny and sad too.
273;The best part that I like is when Hogarth is trying to hide the Iron Giant because he is huge.
274;I also like the story because it is about friendship.
275;I will recommend it to my friends and family.
276;Perfect for both young children and adults looking for something both fun and meaningful/ thought provoking.
277;This was my 13 year old's favorite movie as a kid.
278;It's a wonderful story about a little boy who finds a giant robot during Cold War days.
279;It's one of those movies with so many every day heroes that you can't possibly pick a favorite character.
280;It's a great message to kids about believing in those you love and believing in yourself.
281;My 4 year old grandson likes it as much as I do.
282;It is a hopeful story that is relevant to us today.
283;My grandson (2) and my granddaughter (12) both loved this movie.
284;Thank you for having it and selling at a good price.
285;In 1957, Sputnik was launched by Russia and a wave of quiet hysteria gripped the nation that eventually launched the Space Race and this is the climate of this particular movie.
286;Awesome family movie,,kids love it ,,,and it's not hard for adults to sit through ,, good price too,shipping was ok
287;A truly wonderful movie .
288;for kids and kids at heart adults of all ages.
289;A because it has action, fun and the biggest hero there is.
290;Characterisation is great and despite some headline names for the voices, they are never out of perspective.
291;This was one of my kids' favorite movies when they were little.
292;The story is sweet, a boy and his best friend, who just happens to be a giant robot from outer space.
293;This is one of the best movies.
294;"Brad Bird or ""Big Brad Bird"" as he likes to be called, really only puts out amazing movies."
295;It's also a very funny movie and, if you let it be, even heartwarming.
296;"There are a few of the ""lesser curse words"" in case that is an issue, and one slightly blasphemous part
297;I highly recommend this movie, and if you've read all of my review then I suppose that is what you wanted to hear from me.
298;This is a finely crafted movie for all ages and is one to be watched over and over.
299;Wonderful story told succinctly and well.
300;But I wanted to acknowledge one of Brad Bird's really great pre.
301;pixar movies and to add my voice to the chorus proclaiming what a gem this underrated and often unknown little film truly is.
302;This movie is the best movie.
303;The image is sharp and the colors are true.
304;This is especially appreciated when viewing some of the more spectacular animated sequences, such as the storm at sea at the very beginning of the film, or the combat scenes near the end.
305;My ears heard sound from all six speakers, and the sound is very nicely done.
306;There are not a lot of extras on this disk, but it is better supplied than most family films.
307;This movie was a huge part of my childhood growing up and I just had to own it.
308;i got so emotional (Im a sap) and just the best feeling of nostalgia.
309;I was really surprised at how good it was.
310;The Iron Giant works at many levels: as an amazing piece of animation, as an entertaining childrens' story, as a family movie, but also as deeply moving addition to an already rich trove of Catholic Eucharistic theology.
311;The image of a great man from above coming to the earth, learning to love the creatures he meets, being touched by the death he sees around him, with a great power to save others from their own sins inside him but he sets it aside.
312;I've seen it a dozen times and still get a lump in my throat.
313;forget """"one of the best animated films ever""""."""
314;This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
315;"It's a surprisingly moving story about friendhsip and loyalty with additional subtext regarding such ""grown up"" issues as patriotism, intolerance, fear and our gun culture."
316;Yet at its big, beating heart the film remains an engrossing adventure story that will resonate with viewers of all ages.
317;The giant is befriended by young Hogarth, an inqisitive boy who teaches him what it means to be human, to have a soul and to do a cannonball into a lake, although not necessarily in that order.
318;but politics aside, The Iron Giant is a fun and fast paced story that is ultimately about the friendship between a young boy and a misunderstood creature from another world.
319;That is where its heart lies and what makes it so endearing.
320;These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999.
321;more interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers .
322;"The words ""Superman"" are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words."
323;but there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones.
324;set in the 1950's this family adventure is one of the best film by director Brad Bird, (The incredibles, Ratatouille, and MI4: Ghost Protocol) being both extremely Funny and Deeply Moving., it is a can't miss for all lovers of animation, Syfy, or Superman.
325;Grandkids loved it Anything with robots and giants they love.
326;THE BEST animated film in years!
327;A truly unique and wonderful story, great characters, and flawless animation.
328;Full of wonderous imagination, side splitting humor, and genuine human emotion.
329;This is as close to perfection as animated movies get.
330;The product was brand new .
331;This is one of my favorite animated films ever.
332;It shows Brad Bird's true genius as a filmmaker, and I wish I had seen it sooner!
333;A lovely lesson in loyalty, helping a stranger, and a reminder of how a good thing can be considered bad until it is better known.
334;It's a very fun visit to an interesting time, has great characters and really nice message.
335;Pop up some popcorn, turn the lights down and enjoy!
336;I thought it was a great film.
337;I really like the animation style, my kids liked the movie a lot and it kept them very interested.
338;There were some great laughs in the trailer, but I wondered if this film could succeed for Warner Bros' family entertainment where the last two failed ( Jack Frost and The King I ).
339;Then one good review after another appeared for The Iron Giant and I decided to give it a shot.
340;I was entertained from beginning to the end, and I cared about these characters.
341;I thought the animation was extremely well done.
342;It has an important message to kids about guns and killing.
343;I felt that the message is delivered in a simple and effective way.
344;And it comes at the right time, with all of the school massacres that dominated the news all year.
345;But maybe it will find the audience it truly deserves, thanks to home video.
346;And this film chooses to be incredible.
347;I was so moved by the display of friendship between Hogarth and the Giant that the ending brought a couple of tears to my eyes.
348;This present worked out well!
349;The recipient loved it and has enjoyed reading it immensely.
350;Thank you so much sirs!
351;, so I sat in the theatre curiously eager!
352;, I had no real expectations, so the full impact of the movie was wonderfully unexpected!
353;hogarth a young boy, discovers a Giant Iron man in the forest while hunting, it is our first introduction of a friendship that will lead them to many adventures both hilarious and sad.
354;I left the movie appreciating its simple message, and glad to have seen this hand drawn masterpiece, I highly recommend this movie to both Adults and children, you will laugh you will cry (like I did!)
355;and you will most definately enjoy this lovely movie.
356;This is an excellent movie through and through.
357;Either way, the great equalizer (home video) has stepped up to give everyone another chance at what has to be one of,if not THE, best animated features of all time.
358;Set in the 50's, the Iron Giant is the story of young Hogarth Hughes, a lively and likable little guy who's mother works in the local cafe.
359;much the whole town in general.
360;This he manages by forming a new friendship with Dean, the local beatnik metal sculpturist who agrees to let the Iron Giant hide out in his scrap yard temporarily.
361;The Iron Giant is an incredibly sweet movie with genuine heart.
362;Drawn in a style that is sort of a cross between Hank Ketchum (Dennis the Menace)and early Warner Classics, it's clean lines and rapid.
363;fire humor make for a movie that is equally enjoyable to both kids and the adults that sit and watch with them.
364;The animators have done a fantastic job of emphasising the Giant's formidable proportions while also making him instantly likable.
365;pint of chocolate milk, Iron Giant is simply a great movie.
366;Surprisingly, WB surpassed Disney this year!
367;First of all, The Iron Giant has its own artistic style.
368;d artworks were outstanding and brilliant.
369;Most importantly, The Iron Giant has a very touching story.
370;You would have the sympathy for the big metal guy , but you will also laugh at some plots.
371;The Iron Giant is the best animation of the year undoubtfully, and I recommend it with enthusiasm.
372;My grandkids received this for Christmas and they love it.
373;It is a really sweet movie.
374;It's a good story that makes me weepy.
375;My 3 year old grandson loves this movie, he would watch it every day if I were to let him.
376;His 7 year old brother likes it too, and is entertaining for adults.
377;I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
378;My kids loved it, and I enjoyed it as well!
379;Now what makes this animated story stand out is the animation, music, and soul of the story.
380;"If you enjoyed this, catch ""Robots"" and ""The Robinsons""."
381;I got this to watch with my grandchildren who thought it as great.
382;It is a really good coming of age story set during the cold war.
383;The traditional animation is well done.
384;Great visuals, story line, and suspense.
385;This movie is an all time favorite for my kids .
386;A sweet and memorable story.
387;Sweet and funny aren't the usual words to describe a giant alien, but they are for this particular giant.
388;I watch this movie several times a year, and my children are grown and out of the house.
389;none one of the greatest animated films of the last generation.
390;My kids loved this movei and now I can pass it on to my nephews to enjoy .
391;It's great to have a password to connect to the Wi.
392;This movie was surprisingly touching.
393;I loved the animation and characters but most of all, I loved the story.
394;Sacrifice, love and friendship were the over.
395;riding themes throughout this touching story.
396;Highly unpredictable, it showed how we all are capable of reacting toward acts of kindness and acts of fear, which lead to violence, which in the end, always makes a 360 degree turn.
397;It was smart, funny and dealt with real human emotions in a very real way.
398;A movie to cherish with children for ages to come.
399;"My 3 year old loved this movie from beginning to end, (once he got over being afraid of the ""iron man"")."
400;"A rare, ""boy"" movie in the truest form."
401;With a great star line.
402;This movie is a classic!
403;I have seen it before and I did enjoy watching it again.
404;It is an ode to friendship.
405;I like it, my 18 year.
406;old daughter likes it, my wife likes it, and most importantly my almost 6 year.
407;The ending continues to bring a tear to my son's eye each time so very sensitive young viewer's may need to be consoled lest they miss the uplift at the end.
408;rethinking of what compassion, peace, tolerance, understanding, friendship, and all those other wondrous .
409;i loved it as much, if not more, than my small children.
410;This was a great movie.
411;My son and I really enjoyed it.
412;old Grandson loves this movie!
413;A co. worker (her kids are 3 and 4 loved it so I bought it!)
414;Wonderful kids movie with enough of a story line or plot to make an adult not mind watching it 100 times.
415;Both of my sons began watching it at around 3 years of age and enjoy it immensely.
416;Anyway, after watching it I could see the magic that Brad has brought to the Pixar movies evident in the movie.
417;It is essentially a below age 13 movie but I enjoyed it too.
418;When i am watching this video, this video is greater than i thought!
419;This movie is better to watch with family!
420;The product arrived sooner than was posted and it was in excellent condition as well.
421;the outside is a bit beat up but other then that it was great.
422;given all that, I say without reservation that THE IRON GIANT is easily one of the most genuine, wonderous films I have ever seen.
423;I absolutely love this movie.
424;The special edition made it (if I can say) even better, with all of the extras and insights.
425;Amazing movie for a great price.
426;Highly recommend for animation lovers!
427;My 3 year old daughter loves this movie.
428;appropriate, but we enjoy watching it together.
429;This is movie my son loved in his younger years.
430;Was pleased to find it !!
431;Nevertheless, The Iron Giant just shines on its own.
432;set in the 50s when the Red Scare had its paranoid grip on the public, The Iron Giant uses all the cultural nuances of that period to its advantage.
433;Of course, the secret friendship between the boy and the giant do not last long, and what ensues is masterful storytelling and great animation.
434;It's fun, it's touching, and it's definitely worth the price of admission.
435;This is a brilliant film, and one that is as pleasing to adults as it is to kids (I watched it with my 5.
436;old nephew, and he loved it as much as I did).
437;the film is otherwise delightfully original in all of its details.
438;"the characters are humourous and the plot meaningful, with a really emotional climax(""You are who you want to be!"""
439;Want to see great animation without sitting through singing and goofy animal sidekicks?
440;The Iron Giant will be a dream come true for you.
441;One of the great animated films of all times.
442;BUT, somehow when they are all integrated, an amazing little film pops up.
443;This is THE PERFECT Grandfather/Grandson movie with a wonderfully hopeful ending.
444;It has framed our relationship and become a warm blanket tradition we can share again and again.
445;I am SURE he will watch it with HIS children and grandchildren and remember our times together with each showing.
446;There really aren't many films that can create such wonderful memories.
447;A great movie for any age, so I bought it for my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter
448;It is very rare that I enjoy cartoon movies that are directed at younger kids.
449;a beautifully animated movie, with plenty of laughs along the way, and with an sad, amazing ending.
450;This movie is enjoyable for both young and old, my teenage son and my 5 year old granddaughter loved it, as did I.
451;A lot of people know Brad Bird's name now because of Pixar's 6th film he directed, the Incredibles.
452;To animation geeks, he did the Family Dog segment from Spielberg's Amazing Stories and he was a creative consultant/director on Simpsons.
453;One night during a storm, something from space crash lands in the ocean and makes its way to a port town in the forest.
454;It's a more mature story that happens to be animated so most adults will probably bypass it.
455;what makes the film work is the film's heart and its tone.
456;It's also got a great ending which gives you a sense of closure without being a cop.
457;story and characters are important and the story's great enough but the characters shine through as well.
458;And Eli Marienthal gets a high.
459;five for his great timing and voice inflections.
460;THE IRON GIANT is here to tell the world that the old art is alive and well.
461;This is such a well made and touching film, with humor and heart, and superb voice overs.
462;It resonantes like E. t., tackling childhood innocence, danger, death, and rebirth with the same funny and touching aplomb.
463;Let them see what a real family film is all about.
464;This has been one of my all time favorite movies since I was young.
465;"This film is a ""sleeper hit"" and did not get a lot of marketing or attention when it was released but I tell you it is one of the best animation films ever made."
466;"In fact, this was an early film created by Brad Bird who also created the phenomenal Pixar film, ""The Incredibles""."
467;ups should learn and keeps your interest from the first to the last scenes.
468;My husband and I both adore this film, and our 7 year old just loves it.
469;In my opinion, one of the finest animated films of all time.
470;The plot, the direction, the characters, the actors, and most of all, the message .
471;everything about it is perfect, purely perfect.
472;this is a film that everyone should own, and everyone should watch, whether they have children or not.
473;You'll fall in love with it, because this film is perfect .
474;It is one of those rare animated films that both adults and kids can appreciate.
475;It is also a nostalgic ode to the '50s that is thought.
476;This is a very informative, if slightly technical track.
477;Teddy Newton `The X. factor' is a five.
478;minute look at storyboard artist, Newton.
479;Duck and Cover Sequence features Newton again as he talks about the creation of the old educational film that Hogarth and his class watch.
480;It briefly examines Vin Diesel's work on The Iron Giant.
481;Behind the Armor allows you to watch the movie and at certain points access behind.
482;"the Iron Giant is one of those rare animated films that not only appeals to both children and adults
483;In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching story about tolerance and compassion.
484;pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film.
485;in an honest and heartfelt way.
486;From all indications, The Iron Giant was clearly a labour of love for those involved and this translates into an enjoyable film for everyone to enjoy.
487;This is an excellent story for kids with mild violence.
488;In the end the iron giant gives his life to save the young boy's town.
489;like giant that we get to know through out the film with the violent battle robot it transforms into toward the end.
490;This was quite a schock to most of the kids in the theatre.
491;Despite this, The Iron Giant has a great message about passivisim and non.
492;I have seen it twice with my son and the ending still makes us both cry.
493;Watch the movie WITH your child so you can explain and answer any questions.
494;I LOVED this movie when I was younger.
495;See boys, now they understand.
496;It is an intense movie but their little minds don't absorb just the 'guns' and bad things that others have reviewed.
497;The first few times, they just laughed at the little boys antics, the cartoonish funny scenes and wowed at the giant.
498;Watch it, enjoy it, try not to read to much into it and you will find a beautiful movie for adults, with tons of laughs for the kiddos.
499;and there IS a happy ending.
500;When a young boy in 1950s America, with a penchant for befriending animals and other non.
501;take a good dose of Frankenstein, stir in an even larger dose of E. T., and sell the idea to Walt Disney and you end up with the best animated film in years where Warner Brothers tops Disney at its own game!
502;The animation is fluidly gorgeous, the story totally engrossing and (as a bonus) it's completely bereft of the often.
503;it's also one of the feel.
504;good movies of the year, in a year that is proving once again that great films can be made with ratings of PG (this film) and even G (as evidenced previously by Toy Story 2 and The Straight Story) which means it's highly recommended for the entire family.
505;Great film and funny but touching too.
506;you will tear up at the end
507;The headline says it all: this is one of the best animated films you will ever see.
508;town Maine setting is beautifully rendered using traditional animation, combined subtly with digital techniques for the giant and other elements.
509;The story is fairly simple, but carries powerful messages about the nature of fear, violence, imagination, and community.
510;Great movie to watch with the whole family.
511;1999's The Iron Giant is one of those truly outstanding films that never got the attention it deserved at the time of its theatrical release.
512;While it may not have the glitzy look and feel of a Disney film, this Warner Brothers animated movie is of the highest caliber.
513;The Iron Giant has a heart and a natural home.
514;spun appeal that make it a great film for children as well as adults.
515;The animation is solid and impressive without any over.
516;it is 1957, and the Soviets have just launched Sputnik, giving rise to a sense of concern to the American people and its government.
517;The giant gets a poignant and sad bird's.
518;As might be expected, the giant eventually has to prove himself in a way that will convince even those who fear him of his kind and generous soul.
519;In essence, the giant becomes the most human character in the film.
520;By and large, the movie is humorous on a number of levels, exuding obvious appeal to young and old alike.
521;This movie has something for everyone.
522;It has a great plot, good character developement, and unbelievable animation.
523;It deserves a look by anyone who has ever dreamed of things and wished they were true.
524;fun for all ages and Highly recommended!!!
525;But it has well known actors and actress.
526;I love it for the kids it sends a good message about life.
527;I do believe this is a child's movie"
528;But in the Iron Giant it is not the detail that is so powerful, it is the attention to the subtle movements and the tender story that unfolds between Hogarth and the Giant.
529;There is plenty of what I'd call The Charlotte's Web element in this movie.
530;The viewing of the world thorough the eyes of a child.
531;The simple truths and uncorrupted morals of 'guns kill' and 'be who you choose to be' are touchingly brought up and presented to the viewer without making everything overdramatic.
532;Additionally, the cold war mentalities, fears, paranoias, school drills, and such are quite effectively presented and yet in the midst of all of these mature topics, you'll find yourself rolling with laughter during some very funny sequences.
533;And not only will the story's elements of friendship and sacrifice remind you of a classic feature like Charlotte's Web, there are awesome action sequences that really push the excitement level several notches.
534;That's what I'm going to do!
535;this is one of the best animated movies of all time.
536;storywise, one of the most touching films i have ever seen.
537;Everyone who has seen The Iron Giant loves it.
538;But The Iron Giant is a truly great film.
539;It's just a great movie.
540;Adults enjoy it as much as anybody.
541;It will make you laugh, cry, and love the people you're with.
542;Would recommend to all people with small children.
543;For an older movie it is great.
544;This is one of the most underrated, well acted movies of last year, and one of the top animated films of all time.
545;Funny, warm and VERY family friendly, this belongs in every video collection.
546;My kids loved this movie when they were little.
547;An ET like story, which is timeless.
548;Even though animation has progressed past this movie the story is engaging and the artwork is very good and the actors voicing the movie do a nice job.
549;But monitoring him carefully, and considering the other standards and rules we have in our home, I was impressed to see him empathize with the sad parts, frighten when it was scary, and laugh at the many funny moments.
550;my opinion is that the animations and visuals are beautiful, the voice acting is top.
551;It's a little more violent than I would like, but my son loves it.
552;The story is very cute.
553;gun/war/whatever you want to call it message, but I can see that some might.
554;Big Fan of two grandsons age 5 and 6 and even though I had watched it years and years ago with my daughters now I enjoy watching with grandsons.
555;Best animated feature Warner's done in decades.
556;It has easily become one of my favorite movies of the 1990s.
557;Genuinely wonderful family viewing, and it completely avoids almost all the Disney stereotypes for animated features.
558;Any child of almost any age should love it.
559;Their family watched it 3 times the first two days after receiving it!
560;And believe me, they are FUSSY!
561;They absolutely loved it so we bought this movie so they can watch it when ever they want!
562;i watched the movie with him and enjoyed it thoroughly.
563;The storyline is excellent, well.
564;paced and animated with a gorgeousness and gorgeouscity I didn't believe possible (''real'' movie makers take note).
565;Really good movie for the whole family!
566;It made us both tearful that it affected him so.
567;This is a really good powerful movie in its seeming simplicity.
568;This is by far the best Non Disney movie I've seen.
569;First seen as a kids story, but interesting enough for adults to watch too.
570;Good story line, characters, and animation.
571;loved it when it first came out and still holds up.
572;what a fun and touching movie for all ages.
573;watched it with my 8 and 9 year old niece and nephew and we we're all laughing and crying!
574;My four grandkids LOVE this movie.
575;Entertaining, funny and a good message.
576;there's plenty of action and laughs for kids.
577;the animation is wonderfully done, and the music meshes well with the action yet is unobtrusive.
578;Both do a good job of expressing emotional nuance.
579;This is an excellent movie made possible by the man who brought you The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Batteries Not Included.
580;He is a brilliant man with an aptitude for film making.
581;the up side: Pretty much everything else.
582;pixar animation is beautiful (it will look primitive to those raised on digital animation, but the drawings are lovely).
583;The human characters are adequate: I wouldn't say I particularly care about any of them, but the robot is what really matters and the humans.
584;do well enough in supporting roles.
585;boy element will appeal to older children and the more complex elements will appeal to those of us who are old enough to remember the Cold War.
586;While there is plenty here for them, there is also an abundance of witty dialogue and comic situations that adults should love as well.
587;"Hogarth saves the robot, thus making a friend of him, by pulling down on a huge ""on/off"" switch at the town's power station."
588;style animation and computer animation melds surprisingly well, and is both inventive and extraordinary.
589;This film is great for both kids and kids.
590;A great story with a marvelous ending.
591;This is the kind of movie that people who enjoy family movies should have in their libraries.
592;My son watches this movie over and over again he loves it!!!
593;It is really really cute!!
594;This one was fine and worked well.
595;Action packed excitement from start to finish with a Love story thrown in for good measure.
596;And that includes everyone in our family of five, from age 3 to 42.
597;The characters are well done and memorable,such as, the cool Dean, the deplorable Mansley, etc.
598;This is a very nice movie for young people.
599;My husband likes this film as much as they do.
600;Iron Giant is film that my 10 year old son and I equally enjoyed.
601;now it's one of his favorites.
602;This movie was a work of art.
603;Most animated movies are sanitized for kids but this was a real movie.
604;I thought the animation had a refreshing style that showed that the style common of most of todays animated features is not the only way to draw.
605;My 3.5 year old son and I love this movie.
606;I would recommend it to anyone with an adventurous little boy.
607;My five year old son loves this movie.
608;This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to.
609;"now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause
610;To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family.
611;warming,"""" or even """"cute"""""
612;Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are.
613;I'll start this review saying that the technical aspects of this film are fantastic.
614;The animation is top notch for American standards, and the computer generated Giant is blended in seamlessly.
615;The Iron Giant is easily the best American animated film from a studio other than Disney.
616;The Iron Giant takes place in 1957, during the early years of the Cold War.
617;The final act is so emotional and heart.
618;Very few animated films have this kind of impact these days.
619;Warner Brothers has got to improve on the way they advertise and package their films, because this and many others have done so poorly.
620;I hope that you enjoy its many levels as much as I have.
621;layered disc, with widescreen on one side and full.
622;There should be a new special edition (possible 2.
623;Others have talked about the amazing technical aspects of the film.
624;making and how it's just a really, really well done piece of beautiful, thought.
625;provoking and entertaining art and narrative.
626;People of all ages can find meaningful and humorous things to enjoy from this movie.
627;"this movie was great in the theatres when i saw it with my kids several years ago
628;sweet story of love, acceptance and friendship!
629;As a mother and teacher, I look for movies, stories and other entertainment that can convey positive messages and this one does that.
630;Its message of each person choosing to be the villain or hero in their personal life is well written.
631;This could be the best animated movie I have ever seen.
632;This movie includes maybe the best voice cast animated movies ever had.
633;In fact, one of the most impressive things of this movie are the voices provided by Jennifer Aniston and Eli Marienthal.
634;The picture and sound qualities are outstanding and the bonus features actually entertain.
635;Very well developed characters, an amazing story and a masterful directing are only a part of what will leave you wanting to watch this movie again, and again.
636;This a joy to watch and contains something rarely encountered in even live action films.
637;The editorial review above refers to this work as """"unpopular""""."""
638;It is funny, dramatic and heartfelt.
639;Do yourself a favor, show this film to your kids, and sit down and watch it with them!
640;I would recommend this for both kids and adults.
641;the animation and characters, the judicious use of computerized technology, the sophisticated humor yet works for the whole family, all perfect and the script could have been done at a billion dollar budget live.
642;aside from the stunning look of an old Disney.
643;level animated film, which this of course has even better than Disney, there is a crisp, no.
644;vertigo kind of animation here that shows LOVE.
645;All I can tell you is, any film that shows that much love is automatically the best there is.
646;but I'd still enjoy a LOT more Brad Bird.
647;I enjoy this movie a lot.
648;It's a story that I trace back to my childhood and I love it for that.
649;It's a great movie, kind of cheasy, but such a significant meaning behind it as well.
650;The plot and pacing are spot.
651;Everything fits and flows well, and it ends on a profound note of sorrow and hope.
652;I often don't expect animated films to mean much, but in many ways this one is as heartbreaking, hopeful, and beautiful as a film like The Shawshank Redemption.
653;It is also gorgeously drawn, combining traditional and CG animation seamlessly.
654;I wouldn't show it to really young kids, but for those who aren't too sensitive to a couple scary images it's a great film for introducing topics like death, fear of the unknown, unlikely friendship, acceptance of difference, using one's abilities for the good of others, love, and sacrifice.
655;This film is for everyone.
656;This is definitely a classic!
657;Touching and humorous, but with an important message.
658;Something in it for everyone, young or old.
659;i've watched it with my son and my mother and they both loved it.
660;set during the Cold War, this is the story of young Hogarth Hughes who is not only cursed with that awful name but a gifted mind that has popped into an older grade where he is tormented by bullies.
661;His single mom works as a waitress, so Hogarth is pretty much on his own until an adventure leads him to discover a giant robot that happens to have no idea why he is there.
662;My 3 year old really likes this movie.
663;Great fun for all ages.
664;time best animated movies, with excellent animation, voices, and direction.
665;"Doesn't preach or pander to any one audience, but has moments that are fun for adults (check out the ""Atomic Holocuast"" movie."
666;year old's favorite movie as well, and I suspect it will remain so for years to come.
667;This is the type of feature film that illustrates VERY clearly why animation is a viable medium for storytelling.
668;It also shows us why it is good to have major studios taking serious interest in feature.
669;Disney is good, but they SHOULD take this movie as an object lesson in how to present a story honestly.
670;The Giant has got to be the best fantasy.
671;This movie is so awesome.
672;It's a great movie about the communist scare of the 50's
673;We just loved this movie and will be watching it again and again.
674;Just came upon it when wanting to watch something and I glad we did.
675;Great for kids, but has kind of an agenda.
676;The animation is superb, the characters are likable, believable and compelling, there are no wacky talking animal side.
677;kicks, no syrupy top.40 songs, the Giant himself is one of the most complex characters in any movie I've seen lately . . . I could go on and on, this film succeeds on so many levels.
678;I literally laughed and cried.
679;*Do yourself a favor when you watch it, keep your eyes peeled for the wonderful cameo by legendary Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.
680;The likenesses are great and, yes, it's their voices.
681;It's a nice tribute to two great and influential animators, and it isn't even a Disney picture!
682;I recently found out this was a big favorite of his.
683;This movie is a classic, always a must watch.
684;My kids love it and are always real focased, entertained and quiet while the movie is on.
685;Movie came on time and in good shape.
686;Its perfect for lil boys who really like robots.
687;The Iron Giant has become an instant classic in our family of two 30.
688;fleshed out plots and sub plots, and the great voice talent.
689;The Iron Giant is the story of Hogarth, growing up in the 1950s with a single, hard working mother.
690;Hogarth is an outcast poindexter in school and a wild, imaginative handful at home.
691;plot issues are great) and animation (just watch how the Iron Giant imitates how Hogarth sits down) that take this way beyond any of the recent Disney movies.
692;Harry Connick Jr.'s character (an art building beatnik) is fantastic with deep.
693;appropriate for young kids and a *must* see.
694;This is one of the most underrated animated movies ever.
695;"Make sure to watch it with your kids
696;I bought it for my grandchildren so we're now at the 3rd generation since I consider myself the first.
697;This is a movie for those people that like a good story.
698;Love , courage, sacrifice, hope, it's just something you don't see coming.
699;This is a great movie.
700;He finds the robot and keeps him.
701;Something having to do with Region .
702;A great movie for the entire family to watch.
703;Our grandson loved it and it had a rating of almost 5 stars!!
704;A must see for the entire family, very well done.
705;It's got adventure, comedy and drama.
706;I must confess that it made cry but we absolutely love this movie.
707;Both my son and my daughter consider this their favorite movie of all time and continue to hope for a sequel.
708;and over and over and over again my daughter even likes it
709;A great, simple story with incredible animation.
710;True emotion and grit are the standard for this incredible animated film.
711;A must see for ALL fans of animation.
712;THe Iron giant is a film that is set in the late fifties.
713;This is the best american animated movie of 1999.
714;There are very few animated films by american animators that adults would actually find entertaining.
715;This film will appeal to young, old, male, female, and even teens.
716;They had a great time.
717;old did not think it was too scarey (he's a boy) and his older sisters thought it was a fun and exciting movie.
718;They are dying to get this video and it will make a great Christmas stocking stuffer.
719;And its got a great story line.
720;My kids and I absolutely loved this movie.
721;I had never heard if it when I ordered it and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.
722;Seems simple compared to a lot of other animated films today, but that made it sort of refreshing.
723;When the storyline is so good, you don't need a lot of high tech graphics or hype.
724;We have watched it several times and I could watch it again right now!
725;One viewer thought that it was noble for the robot to seek to give his life for the sake of a community.
726;A good entertaining movie, that every family should add to the classical collection.
727;The film's trailer initially brought it to my attention.
728;Needless to say, I liked the film very much.
729;I consider it one of my favorite films.
730;All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it.
731;It is a film for everyone.
732;I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, """"That was a good one."""
733;I thought I was alone in my reaction to this film.
734;After I got hooked up to the Internet, I found that there were literally thousands of people who were also moved by this film.
735;The closest I can come to saying why I liked THE IRON GIANT is that it somehow made me reflect on my life's experiences in a very nostalgic and endearing way, yet it did not let me forget that we still grow and learn new experiences every new day.
736;This isn't just a great animated movie, or a great kids' movie.
737;This is one of the best movies of the 1990s.
738;This is an excellent overlooked animation from Warner Brothers instead of the usual Disney or Pixar.
739;The movie works very well with both an adult and children audience with one word of warning.
740;Great movie and fun to watch.
741;Also has a good message.
742;This movie is for everyone, young and old alike.
743;the animation is a curious and compelling mixture of traditional 'Disney' type characters (big eyes, big heads, etc.), sci.
744;this is the most emotionally entertaining and engaging film of the year.
745;You'll laugh AND cry AND cheer when watching it.
746;It's destined to become a classic.
747;It was entertaining for my grandchildren as well as the adults.
748;It should be interesting to all.
749;And the voice of Jennifer Aniston is amazing.
750;First of all, the animation is great.
751;The characters are likeable, with the exception of the sterotypical paranoid government agent.
752;The story line for the first two thirds of the movie is both funny and touching.
753;after throughly enjoying the first two.
754;This films is one of my all time favorites.
755;This is a great movie for all ages.
756;I'm 29 and I enjoyed it greatly.
757;This was a gift for my Best Friend and she also loves it.
758;It was in great condition when i got it.
759;This movie is fun for the whole family, perhaps a little frightening at times for the under 5 crowd.
760;My two boys who are 5 and two love it, but always watch it with my husband or I.
761;This movie has a lot going for it .
762;decent story, good characters, clever use of CG (the comic books and the Giant, for the most part).
763;Finally, another movie this summer worthy of five stars!
764;, this has to be one of my favorite movies of the summer.
765;Great story, great animation, great voice acting . . . a movie that tries to, and successfully does, recapture the gee.
766;whiz feeling of all those sci.
767;Otherwise this is one of the greatest films ever made, live.
768;The movie has a great message for kids.
769;Kids loved it right away and wanted to watch it again and again.
770;My girls love this movie.
771;It's a sweet movie and I think it appeals equally to boys and girls.
772;It is laugh out loud funny.
773;Even my sons, ages 27 and 30, loved it and lauged all the way until the end.
774;This is one the whole family can enjoy, we watched this with my 7 year old nephew and we enjoyed it just as much as he did and it taught good values that are missing from much of today's youth entertainment.
775;Great family show, watched it with wife and kids.
776;Themes are of interest to kids.
777;Amazing for any age I. e. for the whole family.
778;Gets better with every viewing.
779;I'm 16 now but I used to watch it multiple times a year around 8, 9, and even 10 years ago.
780;this movie has never failed to make me cry, and the story is fabulous with humor that both adults and children will enjoy.
781;Will always be one of my favorite movies.
782;A timeless masterpiece, proving that the big D isn't the master in story and animation.
783;There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun.
784;but the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero.
785;It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic.
786;i think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1.
787;Warner did a great job with this movie.
788;The giant also being a gun is depicted as having a choice between good and evil.
789;this movie was so good i wanted to watch it again.
790;it was well made and a great story.
791;it had a good storyboard.
792;fashioned animation, with a message.
793;I enjoyed it as much as they did.
794;One of my Favorite Pixar movies is The Incredibles.
795;he knows how to tell a good story.
796;It is a heartfelt story about a boy and his robot, and it touched my heart as well as my kids'.
797;it even has a segment on Vin Diesel, who was the voice of the iron giant).
798;Great movie for the young and old.
799;The movie The Iron Giant is terrific, my 4 year old loves it.
800;The movie was in great condition, although part way through there was a few places where the movie messed up.
801;The Iron Giant remined me of a line from the movie Interview with The Vampire, in which Louis (Brad Pitt)is described as A vampire with a human soul.
802;Our Iron Giant is A gun with a soul.
803;In some way, this movie tells us about the human nature.
804;The message is encouraging as we can choose who we want to be.
805;Besides all the frolic and fun, there are so many lessons in this movie: friendship, love, loyalty, tolerance, curiosity.
806;This is seriously one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.
807;If you like a good story, and well done animation I highly suggest this movie for you!
808;It deserved far more attention than it got.
809;Part a magical children's story, part glimpse of 1950s anti.
810;communist hysteria, this movie is wonderfully rendered, especially in terms of animation, characterization and dialogue.
811;This movie is funny and far more meaningful than the usual tripe Disney dishes out these days.
812;"The core of the film is somewhat of an ""E. t."" type of story in the sense that a kid befriends an alien."
813;The story has a logical flow, the animation was well done, and there is genuine emotion witnessed before us.
814;Just keep in mind that this is a kid movie that challenges kids to think and ask questions about issues that MAY be complex to children.
815;and really, that's what makes this so refreshing to watch.5 STARS
816;This film has a great plot and is beautifully done.
817;All set during the 1950s this one is really great to watch.
818;It tells a story with good acting and some beautiful art that is incredibly loaded politically.
819;The topics, and their method of address, in this film range across those listed above, and none of them are given a fair shake.
820;And none of them are viewed positively in this film.
821;i felt betrayed by this movie.
822;the art is amazing, and the message is a joke in poor taste.
823;If you want to view this film, please do so with an open mind, because if this is what certain people want to teach my kids, then I understand home schoolers WAY better.
824;Perhaps in part due to the fact that the film bombed at the box office, The Iron Giant has developed quite a cult around it in recent years.
825;Some of the enthusiasm is justified.
826;the animation is quite impressive and the story appealing.
827;witty animated remake of E. t. Think about it.
828;all things considered, The Iron Giant is probably not a waste of time or money, but it is also not the brilliant work of cinema that many of its supporters claim it to be.
829;Story, above all, is beautiful, thoughtful, promotes compassion, hope, and peace!
830;Voicings, especially Harry Connick Jr's, are exceptional.
831;Just enough action, just enough humor, a virtually perfect film for child and adult alike, and CERTAINLY the alternative to the mindless, action.
832;Gotta see it to get it!
833;when I started watching this movie I forgot that it was animated and was completly sucked into the story, and for me the story is the best part of this movie.
834;I expected a cute little buddy movie about a boy and a robot, but what I got was a story about friendship, and being whatever you want to be.
835;this really is a great movie for kids, but not just kids for adults as well.
836;the characters are nice, and well developed.
837;and if all that wasn't enough to make it a good movie, the movie is really funny.
838;please do yourself a favor, pick this one up and watch it with your kids.
839;Great animation, character design, time period.
840;Just discovered this animated movie with my grandaughter and we both loved it so much that she wants to watch it everyday.
841;in the dawn of the Cold War, a 9 year old boy named Hogarth, forms a strong friendship with a gigantic metal.
842;rated family film contains a well written story, memorable characters, great humor and a strong morale message.
843;a truly treasurable family classic.
844;The ending was simply breathtaking.
845;This is something that all kids should watch.
846;It has much more depth than any Disney film has.
847;I can honestly say that the movie rekindled that sense of wonder we all have as children.
848;The film is deep and involving and will have you glued to the screen.
849;The film comments on the time period (1950's) with a wink to the older, wiser adults.
850;The kid is an outsider with a huge heart.
851;The other character so richly drawn is the Giant.
852;dimensional than most characters in live films.
853;It's scary folks, but it's true.
854;The plotline is beautiful and flows from one scene to the next.
855;The picture is superb and the audio is excellent.
856;It has a few features including the Making of.
857;and a music video, but they are secondary to the beautiful artwork so abundantly present in this wonderful piece of work.
858;This is a movie that will be enjoyed on many levels.
859;This movie is guaranteed to warm your heart.
860;A film that can be enjoyed by the entire family, but adults will get so much more than the tots.
861;Set in the Fifties, the film captures that time in American history with a sharp sense of accuracy.
862;"Hopefully the popularity of ""The Incredibles"" and this new release of ""The Iron Giant"" will draw additional exposure to this underrated film, because this is probably the best traditionally."
863;"animated film released since ""The Lion King"" (and will surpass it in the eyes of some)."
864;It manages to be funny, dramatic, tender, action.
865;packed, AND original in one tidily wrapped package.
866;Your kids will love it (although some parts might scare the little ones), you'll love it, and for $14 your budget will love it!
867;the story is wonderful, and the the production is amazing.
868;"I join them
869;The Iron Giant more than merits a place, not only as a masterpiece of animation but as an example of just how good a film can be.
870;i love the fact that a boy can have a friendship with a machine
871;One of the best movies of all time (& definitely Vin Diesel's best).
872;Can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
873;It is has great animations, story lines, and life lessons.
874;Prove to the movie industry that audiences aren't comprised of dolts and watch this superbly crafted tale.
875;This film is rich, moving and humorous.
876;Feast your eyes on the Iron Giant and you'll be glad you did.
877;It's always cool to see movies you're dying to see and not be disappointed.
878;Although when you see a movie you're not expecting much out of and it turns out to be one of your favorites, you can appreciate it that much more.
879;Of course it still has some great comedy bits and lines.
880;as for the animation, it's excellent as well.
881;The Iron Giant character may be computer generated but he's digitally colored to fit in with his surroundings and it completely works.
882;One scene where the giant is shot out of the sky and crashes into the ground is extremely well done.
883;The characters are very likable and Kent Mansley is one of the best """"villains"""" in any animated movie."""
884;It ranks just behind Princess Mononoke as my favorite animated movie of all time.
885;I'd put this movie in with the best of the year so far.
886;Right up there with American Beauty and The Sixth Sense.
887;It is easily one of the best animated movies of all time.
888;It's very easy to forget that you're watching a cartoon, but the charaters are both sophisticated, and witty.
889;This movie will remind you how great it was to be a kid.
890;if you see one animated feature film before you die, this is it.
891;my favorite animated feature of all time.
892;styled story is entertaining for the whole family.
893;Enjoy this movie more for the nostalgia of childhood days gone by and the wonderful innocence of being a kid.
894;The pace and level of action is much better for younger kids than many more recent movies.
895;The animated take on Ted Hughes' book Iron Man is a well done, entertaining version.
896;While the movie story line differs considerably in spots from the original story, it still does a great job of conveying the message.
897;My boys are 5 and 8 and really enjoyed it.
898;One of my favorite movies of all time.
899;The animation is breathtaking, the story is wonderful and the characters are alive in this tale set in the 1950s.
900;The comic timing is wonderful and, (unlike the recent movie Final Fantasy.
901;My favorite scene in the movie is the kitchen scene.
902;It always makes me laugh.
903;"This movie has all the things that makes a movie great
904;I predict this timeless film will be around a LONG time, touching hearts and bringing smiles to generations to come.
905;This is such a creative movie full of imagination.
906;Such a sweet well done film.
907;Can watch it over and over and the whole family enjoys it!
908;I never got a chance to see this little gem in the theaters because it was pulled so quickly.
909;I really wish I would have, because now it's one of my favorite films of the year!
910;The story is wonderfully written with plenty of action, humor and heartbreak.
911;Don't let all the E. t. comparisons distract you, this story was written a good twelve years before Spielberg's film.
912;Its refreshing to see an animated film without any silly musical numbers and annoying sidekicks voiced by the comedic flavor.
913;This film should be rewarded for treating kids with respect and not pandering to them like a certain special effects blockbuster of this past summer.
914;The animation is simply superb.
915;It harkens back to the great early Disney cartoons of the 40s and 50s.
916;The robot was beautifully designed and rendered by these very talented artists.
917;Eli Marienthal played little Hogarth Hughes with the right amount of spunk and intelligence.
918;Harry Connick Jr. was one cool beatnik, Daddy.
919;o and Jennifer Aniston was wonderful as the young caring mother.
920;The supporting cast was also great, but what would you expect from the likes of M. Emmet Walsh and John Mahoney?The Iron Giant was another in a long line of great overlooked films in 1999.
921;Good entertainment with a surprise ending.
922;And it is something to be seen.
923;The Iron Giant is one of the best animated features to be released by any major studio in the recent past.
924;A good story, great characters and excellent animation assure this film a spot in the libraries of all fans of animation or movies in general.
925;The rest of the bonus material is pretty much fluff but it's still worth having.
926;Just tell a good story and tell it well, a feat the Disney studios mastered for a while there but, as of late, seemed to have forgotten.
927;This movie is a great movie for kids and adults alike.
928;It was put together very nicely and I would recommend to any one especially since it is included for free with you amazon prime membership.
929;there are a lot of good animated films out there.
930;BUT this is a great animated film.
931;This was one of Brad Byrd's earlier works (better known for The Incredibles and Ratatouille)and the love he puts into his work really shows.
932;Get your Baxter Bunny toy with your happy meal!
933;This movie has a rich plot, great voice acting, beautiful animation and most importantly, heart.
934;You actually care about the characters and root for them.
935;this is a great movie for all ages.
936;This movie may have heart, but it also has dark moments.
937;It deals with both death and the choices you make.
938;It's a safe kind of dark movie for kids, but be aware that it is more than a lighthearted tale of a boy and his giant.
939;Very kid friendly and adult funny as well.
940;This movie was a really well thought out movie that every age can enjoy and appreciate with a message intented for everyone!
941;We really enjoyed this movie as a family.
942;The way the 'actors' move arround in this movie might really impress you on the level of natural movement.
943;This movie was a favorite of my son, who is now 23.
944;It was wonderful to watch it again and remember how wonderfully done it is.
945;Just clean, funny, and worth the time!
946;It's a wonderful classic and probably one of the most heartfelt movies of all time.
947;A definite must see movie.
948;This is a wonderful movie for boys and girls.
949;It has good story line as well as good lessons to be learned.
950;This is a wonderful movie that can actually make you laugh and cry!
951;This is one of those movies that did not do well at the box office, but everyone must see it.
952;the key point this movie makes is that a person chooses their own path and their own destiny.
953;The Iron Giant was born a gun yet he chooses to be so much more.
954;If all of us would only learn this one lesson, the world would be a more pleasant place to live.
955;Maybe in some small way this movie can help them to make the right choice.
956;Instead this film shows the pressures and feelings the robot has in a comical and sometimes moving way without ever feeling like it has a message.
957;I recommend this movie wholeheartedly and it is in a prime place in my movie collection!Jim
958;The Iron Giant is about friendship betweena boy and a Iron Giant from outerspace and the result is a funny,warm hearted family film that grown ups and kids will enjoy.
959;I lovedthis movie, it's the best Science Fiction family movie since E. t andleaves you feeling just as good when it's over.
960;As stated in the title this is the kind of film we need for our children, films that leave a good message the kids may follow.
961;it's the story of Hogarth Hughes, who lives with his single Mom in Maine of the late Fifties.
962;the basic subtext of the film is the love between a boy and a weapon with a heart.
963;but powerful and incredibly well written.
964;the voice talents include Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr., among others.
965;In my opinion, this film ranks right up there among anything Disney has ever offered and far superior than anything Dreamworks has ever done.
966;incredibly powerful, funny, moving, and just plain wonderful.
967;This is a great family movie!
968;We have movie night every Friday and it makes a perfect fit for young to old.
969;It's a good one and I would have flipped over this movie if it had come out when I was a boy.
970;but the story holds the interest of a wide range of ages.
971;It is interesting to compare the versions for what is left out and what is changed.
972;Brad Bird has taken a story by Ted Hughes and crafted it into a beautiful movie that is somehow incredibly deep while being very simplistic.
973;He has created one of the few movies that is truly perfect for the entire family.
974;There are no annoying Disney sidekicks, only themes that adults and children can appreciate, excellent animation, and a story that will enrapture all who experience it.
975;Mr. Bird and his team has created a movie that is funny and fascinating, and that has one of the most satisfying endings since The Shawshank Redemption.
976;this is a movie for everyone.
977;all will be glad they experienced it.
978;This movie was just amazing and fun to watch.
979;Absolutely great animation, and no cheesy kid parts of this movie.
980;Iron Giant won the Golden Reel Award for the Best Sound Editing.
981;The sound on this film is incredible!
982;The animation is cool and sleek.
983;a great combo of old.
984;The story is moving and beautiful.
985;I think this item is very well put together and I find it very intertaining.
986;I first saw this movie in my early 20s and thought it was great.
987;I have 3 sons aged 9, 7 and 4, and we viewed it as a family recently.
988;The two older boys loved it .
989;my oldest said it was epic.
990;old liked it but thought it was a bit scary.
991;Populated by the voice talents of Harry Connick, Jr. and Jennifer Aniston (among others), this movie's chief assets are its sweet nature, and a refreshing simplicity and restraint in both script and direction.
992;Warm, nostalgic flavoring helps too.
993;fashioned but welcome change of pace to most over.
994;But can Hogarth prove that the giant is a gentle creature that means no harm or will it be destroyed?Co.
995;starring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, M. Emmet Walsh and John Mahoney this is a lavishly animated and well thought animated Sci.
996;The animation in this movie is truly outstanding especially with the art direction and the giant himself and contains excellent voice acting by the cast.
997;What also makes the movie great is that it contains great deal of emotion and heart, it originally bombed in theaters but now has turned into a cult animated classic that has been called one of the greatest animated movies ever and it has to be seen to believed.
998;delivered movie with bits and pieces of humor in it, but mainly seriousness.
999;The animation varies from subtle to stunning and Michael Kamen's score is a perfect accompaniment to the visuals.
1000;Support this great work to make up for the stupidity of Warner Brother's marketing.
1001;and after some initial fear, so does his super cool adult, artist friend Dean.
1002;If he can only confirm this, he can really live his ultimate fantasy.
1003;Hogarth just wants his friend, the robot, to live, be happy, and not be harmed or cause harm to anyone.
1004;His character is a nice refresher for us jaded adults and our thousands of issues.
1005;all of the above aside, it's a very entertaining movie which couldn't be safer for your children to watch, and adults will be thrown back into how they thought as children.
1006;That's the question asked in The Iron Giant, and this 1999 animated film, now a true cult classic, is probably one of the most intellectually and emotionally moving science.

1010;and one to share together with your kids.11/20/2012
1011;This movie is one of my favorites for kids.
1012;You will love the emotion the Giant shows as he learns from the boy.
1013;it's far better in my opinion.
1014;"The Iron Giant was Brad Bird's debut animated feature, several years before he created ""The Incredibles"" (which happens to be the best animated movie I've ever seen)."
1015;Bird, however, is one of the very few animators who can write and tell a story with a genuine human touch.
1016;fi/Cold War thriller with some gentle humor added.
1017;The main character, a friendly red.
1018;driven Giant make for a nice transition between the classic Disney.
1019;style look and the flashy CGI era.
1020;The character mix is also interesting and not typical '50s white.
1021;for animation, and a few well.
1022;style pastiche, and it shows.
1023;fi tribute, but a thoughtful fable with a central theme of friendship and self.
1024;Its surprising, and touching, finale, like the entire movie, is life.

1026;What it is, though, is one of the nicest family.
1027;friendly movies I've seen in a while.
1028;One of the few American animated movies with real depth and meaning.
1029;and a crackling good tribute to, not to mention send.
1030;What a wicked bit of humor there.
1031;Those with the late Michael Kamen, who wrote and conducted the score (in the Czech Republic, oddly enough) are especially interesting.

1033;"time great animation talents for ""Iron Giant"" alone."
1034;It does accomplish the requisite jerking of tears, but it's actually much more than an animated kid's movie.
1035;but this still deserves consideration as a great movie.
1036;I loved this move you laugh then you cry, it keeps you glued to the move to see what happens next.
1037;Has a great message of peace and compassion.
1038;This movie relates very well to that.
1039;I recently watched it for the second time and it now qualifies as hands down one of the greatest animated movies ever made.
1040;The story of Hogarth Hughes and the giant robot he befriends in the middle of Cold Way USA 50's is unbelievably touching.
1041;Brad Bird has created a film that makes you feel good to be alive.
1042;Witty, charming, funny and heartwarming, The Iron Giant is a moral story in the best sense of the word.
1043;It is a story of honesty, courage and redemption.
1044;And more importantly than that, it's one heck of a fun movie.
1045;This movie speaks to you at your level.
1046;my favorite movies are the Godfather movies.
1047;The iron giant is one of my favorite animation movies of all time!!
1048;It haves everything from a nice history, an emotive ending, and very enjoyable characters.
1049;"One of the things I admire most of this movie is the animation of the Iron Giant, it really looks impressive, and the sense of ""big"", tall, metal, robot, is really well accomplished."
1050;Movies like this, really makes me feel like I'm a child again :)I really recommend this movie!
1051;As far as I'm concerned, I could scrap all of my Disney movies and I'd be happy with just this one masterpiece!
1052;The animation is absolutely flawless, the characters (especially the Giant) are just fabulous, and the voice.
1053;This is the perfect family movie, it reflects a lot of good values without shoving them on you, and .
1054;is a perfectly decent film!
1055;And the comedy is absolutely halarious (I commend the person who wrote the screenplay!)
1056;fi as masterfully as this one does.
1057;In the day where stories are made from a girl's point of view, this is great for boys.
1058;Recently, his mother was complimenting him on what a nice human being he was, always taking the high road in disputes.
1059;My eldest son loved it as a boy.
1060;My youngest is fond of the movie real steel so decided to get this movie for him and he loves it too.
1061;Once you see the movie you will wonder why.
1062;Everything about the film is great.
1063;The animation, the voice work, and the story is outstanding.
1064;Its kind of a hidden treasure that is only recently getting discovered by new fans.
1065;Amazing visually, a thrilling story, and genuine heartfelt emotion, everything a good movie should be.
1066;Very entertaining for me AND the kids!
1067;Gotta love Harry Connick, Jr. as a beatnik!
1068;"I watched this movie as a child numerous times and I can assure you the ""political"" and ""anti."
1069;"gun/war"" message that some reviewers feel are in this movie will go right over any kids head."
1070;This is a very touching story about a boy and a robot who become best friends and try to protect each other.
1071;As an anime fan, I found this movie mildly entertaining but the kids love it.
1072;This is a great movie for young children, but maybe an even better movie for pre.
1073;teens/teens and the whole family to discuss.
1074;Her high recommendation was well.
1075;This movie should become a classic.
1076;My husband and I also enjoyed it, as did my 17.
1077;old still brings it up.
1078;I love that it's a great, simple story without all the hoopla, glitzy stuff that typically comes with kid flicks (imagine.

1080;the Iron Giant is complex and sophisticated enough to be a live.
1081;action movie, indeed more complex and sophisticated than the movies that trounced it at the box office (I'm talking to you, Inspector Gadget).
1082;It is a remarkable achievement of all the elements of a movie working at their very best.
1083;The script is funny without resorting to cheap laughs.
1084;The voice talents are ideal, from the Giant's rumble to Hogarth's wide.
1085;eyed wonder (for a welcome change, a pre.
1086;most interestingly, the movie makes such a dynamic, empathic character of the titular hunk of metal that we genuinely care about his fate.
1087;anyone over the age of 8 will love this film.
1088;If you love all types of animation, see it NOW.
1089;One of the best cartoon movies.
1090;Little kids to old timers will enjoy and appreciate this animated story.
1091;Good for the child in all of us.
1092;My son had been looking for this movie, his son loved and he wanted to give it to him for a surprise.
1093;we were thrilled to find it and grandson was thrilled, of course, when he opened
1094;Good for the young at heart too
1095;I love watching kid movies from time to time.
1096;We got this movie years ago for our kids(VHS), so yes, years ago.
1097;As did I. I got it now for my two young nephews.
1098;When my boys saw that I got it for their cousins they just said they will love it, and great movie.
1099;I would recommend this movie for any kid.
1100;Of all the great animation films to ever grace the movie screen, the Iron Giant is possibly one of THE best kept secret ever.
1101;Although the animation is not as technically stunning as some Disney films, the story is simply moving, bravely written, and imaginative.
1102;A must for boys and good for children in general, a great story and stunning animation.
1103;"All I can say is if ""The Incredibles"" is a wonderful as ""The Iron Giant"" I may not be able to stand it!!!!"
1104;"It's much better than lots of ""live."
1105;There's everything I love in a movie .
1106;laughs, a few tears and a story that has a point.
1107;I recommend this movie to adults .
1108;in a very enjoyable way.
1109;My youngest grandson told me that he loved this movie and could I get it for him.
1110;He was very happy when the package came to him in the mail.
1111;Great lesson in life: You are what you choose to be.
1112;The message was wonderful as was the movie.
1113;It is really a must see.

1115;clean 1950's) roots can be seen in the placing of Top.
1116;it's all here for everyone .
1117;I still bawled my eyes out at the end, surprised, saddened and hopeful at the message of the movie.
1118;I have the old VHS version and love the story.
1119;This is a wonderful, family friendly film that teaches the value of true friendship.
1120;Bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he loves it.
1121;This is an amazing movie and quite under.
1122;The characters are well developed and the message is important.
1123;It appeals to both children and adults, more sophisticated than other cartoons.
1124;It is a movie that everyone will want to watch multiple times.
1125;It's a fantastic story, with a hero's ending.
1126;A must see for adults as well as children.
1127;The Iron Giant is a favorite of my children.
1128;It makes us laugh and cry every time.
1129;My kids and I LOVE this film.
1130;It is so under appreciated!
1131;IT is a MUST see for the whole family!
1132;A couple of sad parts but overall a great movie.
1133;Superb animated feature with a touching anti.
1134;Everyone has a chance to be who they choose to be.
1135;The kids loved it and my 8 year old son asked when he could see Iron Giant 2.
1136;iRON GIANT has the very rare, special magic that invokes wonder, warmth and whimsy.
1137;There is mystery,, adventure, imagination, drama and awe.
1138;brought together by some talented people that put a lot of love into making this.
1139;and after you've seen it, tell your friends and family about it.
1140;They liked it, so a 5 it gets.
1141;One of those movies that I love going back and watching again whether my kids are watching with me or not!
1142;But unlike many other films that have faded into obscurity, this film has found its niche through the home video market and become something of a classic.
1143;and quite deservedly so, as it's one of the most heartfelt animated films I've ever seen.
1144;lands in the ocean and wanders into the woods around town, bereft of his memory and seeking food (metal) and a safe place to stay.
1145;the animation in this film is fantastic.
1146;shaded CGI, it manages to combine both elements very well for being a '90s animated feature.
1147;rendered, highly detailed and not clashing horribly with the 2D characters and backgrounds.
1148;And the 1950s setting of the film actually benefits it .
1149;the characters are also well.
1150;done, and in most cases quite likable.
1151;Hogarth is a typical young boy, energetic and hungry for adventure, and while he can be a bit of a smartmouth at times he didn't come across as obnoxious .
1152;he had plenty of kind and heartwarming moments.
1153;The giant himself is .
1154;adorable, somewhat nave and innocent but endlessly curious, with just as much heart as any of the human characters.
1155;Dean serves as a foil for the two main characters, sarcastic and something of a realist, and provides some of the film's funniest moments.
1156;Hogarth's mom, the general, and various townsfolk .
1157;Yes, the army serves as one of the antagonists in this film, but the film is careful to show that the military is acting in what they see as the best interests of the people, and that they are willing to back down when necessary.
1158;That's a message I can fully get behind .
1159;this film brought me close to tears.
1160;It manages to grip the heart that much, especially with its lovable robot character.
1161;an underrated animation classic, this is a must.
1162;Probably best for kids 10 and older due to some violence and language.
1163;I have to say out of all the movie's this was the best choice for my family of 5 to sit down and watch together.
1164;It is such a good movie that it keeps my husband and 3 children entertained, which means I can sit and relax.
1165;This is one of those movies you constantly change the volume from one extreme to the other.
1166;The Iron Giant is a wonderfully told story about a boy who finds agiant metal robot who eats metal.
1167;the tale takes place in a New England town during the Red Scare of the late 1950's.
1168;The director, Brad Bird, has created a film that captures the paranoia that was sweeping our country at that time.
1169;The boy, Hogarth, develops a touching relationship with the giant as it tries to discover why it came to earth.
1170;the movie is a joy to watch and is a future classic.
1171;It makes for excellent family viewing.
1172;A must for the video library!
1173;It was one of the greatest films I have ever seen.
1174;And I do mean greatest.
1175;This movie will make you laugh, cry, and is surely a great movie for your movie collection.
1176;I think adults will enjoy this movie more than the kids because of the more adult humor and story.

1179;The Iron Giant towers over the competition in its genre, and I believe that it will be around much longer than many of its modern counterparts.
1180;It is full of heart, wonder, and amazement.
1181;It has emotional twists that keep you intrigued.
1182;It is definitely worthy of five stars.
1183;first of all, the giant is great.
1184;There is a charm about the giant that I have seen in few Disney or Dreamworks characters.
1185;He is such a wonderful little character to watch on the screen.
1186;the voices in the film are brilliantly cast.
1187;Vin Diesel voices the giant.
1188;He manages to evoke tons of emotion, even though most of his lines have fewer than three words in them.
1189;There is a genuine love between her character and that of Hogarth's that is missing in most animated features today.
1190;"Considering that he plays Stifler's brother in the ""American Pie"" films, he does an amazing job in capturing the wonder inside of Hogarth."
1191;There roles aren't as big, but they are great in the movie.
1192;"From the forest and countryside to the little town that is ""terrorized"" by the giant, it's all brilliantly done."
1193;the story is one full of emotion.
1194;I'll be honest and tell you that I shed a few tears near the end of the movie.

1197;there are a couple of curse words in the movie, but the story is so great that you can look beyond this.
1198;It has a powerful story and never gets too sugary for anyone.
1199;It will hold the attention of all viewers, no matter what their age.
1200;It is worthy of multiple views and definitely worth purchasing.

1207;there's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and someterrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom moreinteresting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a localwanna.
1208;i love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there'ssomething wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they doa great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metalcreature.

1224;Warner Brothers made several mistakes in the advertising plans and released the movie in the middle of a blockbuster summer.
1225;My toddler son adores this movie.
1226;Very interesting messages about warfare and life.
1227;Aside from that my 9yo son loved this movie .
1228;That aside I still do not think the story or the animation was that great.
1229;Set in 1957 the Iron Giant is a fun movie for all who enjoy a good story with lots of imagination.
1230;The stoy of the friendship between a boy and a robot seems to mirror the friendship he finds with the local beat.
1231;One has a giant dream of greatness and the other is great giant with simple dreams.
1232;It's entertainment and worth watching over and over.
1233;So take a trip back to a simple time and smile with the joy of knowing a happy ending is coming your way!
1234;This movie is a timeless classic and can be enjoyed by all ages.
1235;I would recommend this to anyone.
1236;After watching it he told me he liked it, asked to watch it again, and also asked if there was another Iron Giant movie.
1237;I don't think it's worth your time.
1238;It was a really great family movie.
1239;the boy's basically fighting to save his friend and he's really strong willed and doesn't give up.
1240;This is one of those movies that I initially watched with a sceptical eye.
1241;This is one of the coolest movies ever made.
1242;I've watched it since the kids were really little, and still love it!
1243;This movie is very funny and has just enough moral message to make it worthwhile.
1244;It's just really, really good.
1245;This is an amazing movie!
1246;It proves that children's entertainment CAN be intelligent, respectful, creative and heartfelt.
1247;Yes, the animation leaves something to be desired, but the story still shines through.
1248;It is my niece and nephew's #1 choice every time they visit me and is a movie I happily will watch over and over again.
1249;It is even great for adults.
1250;But everytime I play it, it will have a still picture with 15 min.
1251;This is a great family movie.
1252;I bought it for my grandson who loves any and all robots.
1253;Great, classic movie at a fabulous price.
1254;teaches all of us that we can chose what kind of people we want to be!
1255;I can honestly say it was ADORABLE!
1256;It was very well written, well animated, and well done.
1257;It's a great movie no matter what your age!
1258;and I must say I found it refreshing to watch an actual animated movie, rather than a computer animated one!Great movie for kids and adults!
1259;Movie is still awesome, great redo of original story, perfectly crafted characters.
1260;This movie is so underrated.
1261;Amusing, smart work by Brad Bird before he became known for The Incredibles.
1262;Such a beautifully done movie with a great message.
1263;This is such a great movie, I cannot recommend it enough.
1264;Do your whole family a favour and see this!
1265;I just hope it finds its audience on video.
1266;Great movie for the whole family.
1267;the kids and the wife and I enjoy it.
1268;thanks Amazon for a well sercices done.
1269;This is a beautifully done movie, to begin with.
1270;It is one of my favorites.
1271;The kids loved it, because they saw that the cartoon they had seen as little kids actually had a whole other level of meaning.
1272;Many of these blase teens were actually quite moved.
1273;This film, adapted from a Ted Hughes children's book called the Iron Man, is actually a better story in the version offered here by the brilliant Brad Bird, who later directed The Incredibles.
1274;The moral lessons here are subtle yet powerful, as well, and this film could also be used with youth groups.
1275;It provoked some wonderful discussion.
1276;It was $5.00 for a neat gift that is good for family viewing.
1277;My 5 year old son has a new found love of robots and I searched unsucessfully for her movie.
1278;I bought this movie on Amazon and he absolutely loves it.
1279;My daughter loved it as well and was still willing to watch it again with her brother.
1280;is great, I think I paid $[.]
1281;"The characters are likable and believable, the messages of friendship and trust shine through, and the movie doesn't have a soundtrack full of catchy tunes blasted at full volume
1282;That, in my opinion, is one hallmark of a well.
1283;I bought this for my niece and she watches it everyday.
1284;I believe there is a small wonderful message in this video that could benefit all children and maybe even a few adults !!
1285;An amazing movie that is witty, funny and will even make you cry.
1286;So I came this movie with a heavy dose of skepticism.
1287;I came away wiping tears from my eyes and returning that day with my kids and some of their friends to see it again.
1288;It reaches children and adults equally without dumbing it down for adults, and by respecting children's intelligence, and never pandering to them.
1289;This is my sons favorite movie the product worked perfectly at a great price.
1290;the Iron Giant is a fine movie.
1291;Instead of staying shackled to convention, The Iron Giant eschews all the faults associated with other animated films, and simply delivers a charming film that anyone can enjoy.
1292;Pardon the clich , but in this case, it is absolutely true.
1293;the Iron Giant's story is delightfully captivating in all its exquisitely crafted facets.
1294;The script is irresistible, tastefully witty, and profoundly moving.
1295;Time and time again, I marveled at how a single scene could be better than entire movies.
1296;The iron giant himself succeeds in being the ideal non.
1297;human character with a very important human element, and that's one of the greatest merits of this movie's story.
1298;from a technical standpoint, the animation is simply breathtaking.
1299;He is rendered with computers graphics, but with a special cel.
1300;shading technique that makes him look hand.
1301;This allows him to seamlessly blend in with the hand.
1302;drawn environments and other characters.
1303;They'll return to their Disney flicks .
1304;It's a ride through a timeless story and human emotion that few movies match, much less animated films.
1305;Lofty praise, certainly, but every word of it is sincere and true.
1306;Watch it, and you'll agree.
1307;This is one of the best animated movies of all time.
1308;Heartwarming story that still brings tears to my eyes and even my 15yo sniffs a few times.
1309;A family classic thats also funny and amusing.
1310;Sure to become a favorite with your family as well and best of all.
1311;Already more than 300 excellent reviews are here for that.
1312;I just feel it is my obligation to write a recommendation as a true admirer of this animation.
1313;so, whoever you are out there new to this movie, please watch it and join the group of admirers of it!
1314;This gives Hogarth plenty of time to explore and develop his imagination.
1315;There is a crash nearby in the woods and rumors start about some giant creature.
1316;This way we can share it with friends.
1317;So many people will never see this masterpiece because it will most likely be in the kids section at video stores.
1318;Great ending, and overall, a great family movie.
1319;This is a sweet, funny, poignant, great story.
1320;Definitely takes one back to a simpler, safer time in America, and I love the ending.

1335;Nevertheless, the film was able to convey this simple wish.
1336;One of the best movies ever.
1337;My grandkids loved the movie of a alien robot landing on earth.
1338;The Iron Giant has some of the SINGLE best animation in ANY film.
1339;the way the trees move.
1340;everything is fantastic to look at.
1341;A real piece of eye.
1342;The story is wonderful, especialy towards the end of the feature, about a boy and a giant, and how they come to understand one another, and things like death.
1343;It's touching, and maybe a bit sad.
1344;This is a beautiful story, wonderfully told, with humor, pathos, and soul.
1345;So there is a nostalgic feel to it.
1346;The voice actors are terrific as well.
1347;This was a favorite movie for my son when he was 7 years old.
1348;When he turned 16 I bought it for him as a surprise.
1349;He said it was the best gift he got cause it reminded him of being a little kid again.
1350;I really enjoyed watching it with my children.
1351;Outstanding movie that my family and I really enjoy.
1352;I bought it on the basis of the strong reviews I saw on year.
1353;"It relies solely on the strength of its characters to tell the compelling story of young ""Hogarth"" (yes, Hogarth!)"
1354;The real strength of this film is that both adults and children will enjoy it because it works on several levels.
1355;handed), an exciting adventure film, and a comedy that has humor for adults and kids.
1356;My son and I have seen this movie 6 times this summer, and we would have gone more if it had stayed at the theatres longer.
1357;This is honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1358;This is not just a great movie for kids, it is for all ages.
1359;My three year old just loves it.
1360;An amazing wonderful heartfelt movie.
1361;My children loved it years ago and now my grandkids love it.
1362;The lesson that not everything appears to be what it is, very inspirational and filled with love.
1363;the giant is an interesting character.
1364;huge, dangerous but at the same time almost human.
1365;My son loves robots and this was a great movie for any kid who loves robots.
1366;It's a feel good movie any toddler would love.
1367;my kids love this movie.
1368;Along with Stuart Little and Toy Story 2,this film is one of the best 1999 films.
1369;The next day he belives that he can capture the giant.
1370;old son has been absolutely obsessed with this movie for two weeks now.
1371;If it were almost any other animated film, I'd be pulling my hair out by now, but this movie is so well.
1372;I have a ton of respect for the people who made this film and was sad to read that it was a commercial flop .
1373;A frightened sailor sees it and swears that it is a giant made of metal.
1374;rarely has a movie for children .
1375;It also shows how clever we can be at overcoming the most unexpected obstacles.
1376;Perhaps best of all, The Iron Giant examines these and other issues in the guise of a wonderful story that should hold almost anyone's attention.
1377;Most of the voices are good, especially Harry Connick, Jr.'s as Dean Cooper, a hip young artist.
1378;rated PG for a couple of spooky scenes and a few mild profanities.
1379;The Iron Giant is one of those movies that comes along and reminds how good of a storytelling format traditional animation can be.
1380;Instead of getting a standard Disney formula (Male and Female lead characters, with animal sidekick, with a politically correct message) we get a film that pays homage to 1950s B. movies, a McCarthyite villain, and a tale of a boy and his friend trying to learn from each other what it really means to be friends and to have a soul.
1381;in addition, we get the pleasure of an uncredited Vin Diesel role as the voice of the Iron Giant.
1382;I don't cry much, but the ending of this movie was both heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.
1383;One of the most underrated animated movies of all time.
1384;Great characters and a great storyline.
1385;Fantastic movie for both children and adults.
1386;My older children (a boy and a girl) loved this movie when they were younger and my new young ones (both girls) love the movie as well.
1387;Ages as young as 3 can understand the movie and older adults will appreciate the humor as well.
1388;Great story of character and morals.
1389;We just love this movie!
1390;This is a movie I will definitely recommend!
1391;It will make you cry at the end, but there is always a happy ending before the credits rolls out!
1392;We just love this movie!!!
1393;"the story is good, not great
1394;This film has a retro feel because the design and setting is 50's inspired, including the robot itself.
1395;Overall a fun film, and good for kids and adults alike with a believable story surrounding said 'Iron Giant'.
1396;There's a fantastic score by Michael Kamen, and the good thing is there a definite lack of songs, which you might normally find.
1397;it's has a lot of incredible laugh out loud moments, and scenes that you need to watch over and over.
1398;The look on his face was unforgettable, and then he tries sitting on it, and then he starts smashing it to shut it up!
1399;The following scene is hilarious, where you see a racoon desperately trying to swim, or Dean ending up in the middle of the road, soaking wet.
1400;it has bits of ET in it, but the sentimental, tear.
1401;Which was a neat touch I thought.
1402;I got choked up by the end.
1403;I demand you see this movie, and just make sure you have a box of tissues somewhere.
1404;This movie is a classic that everybody has to have in there collection.
1405;I bought it for my 3 year old who loved it.
1406;A majority of time the """"Iron Giant"""" is a gentle giant romping around the forest with his human pal Hogarth."""
1407;His relationship with the young boy is heartwarming as well as heartbreaking.
1408;Harry Connick, Jr. as a beatnik sculpture is great.
1409;It is a wonderful movie with a little boy main character who finds a robot that has crash landed on earth.
1410;there are some pretty strong themes.
1411;the boy tells the robot about souls and being a good person.
1412;i enjoyed watching this movie with my son, it gave me a chance to talk to and get feedback from my son on some issues and he LOVED the movie.
1413;the animation is fabulous with a vintage Disney look to it which goes along with the movie being set in the 1950's.
1414;The Iron Giant is a beautiful, eloquent story.
1415;bursting adrenaline through you, to insightful, deep moments between the all.
1416;I hope Brad Bird Co. are able to bring more magical animations to the big screen in the years ahead.
1417;This is probably my favorite movie of all time right now.
1418;That is a lot to say, but just the creativity, and underlying meaning of this movie I absolutely love.
1419;It is a movie I can watch on a bad day to make me happy again.
1420;I love this movie, and feel that for anyone it is at least worth a try.
1421;This movie is in my top favorite movies list of all time, in fact, It's something I've wanted to own since I first watched it.
1422;I've roped most of my family into watching it with me, and also have seen it with friends.
1423;I love the blend of comedy verses heart in this movie, and I also found the bonus features pretty fun.
1424;I had never heard of this movie but read the reviews and thought it was worth a try.
1425;Quirky and fun, worth watching.
1426;Wonderful animation seamlessly blending hand.
1427;generated artwork, a talented vocal cast and a great story revolving around Cold War fears combine to make an exceptional family film.
1428;The movie itself is proof positive that hollywood can crank out a good family movie.
1429;To tell a story which is both joyful and dramatic,full of star.
1430;eyed wonder and narrative tension, isthe mark which distinguishes the finest authors inany field.
1431;there can be no doubt that THE IRON GIANT stands on itsown as a masterpiece in any genre.
1432;This time, it's Gort's tale, as we marvelat how a skyscraper.
1433;As a talefor all ages, THE IRON GIANT is irresistible.
1434;"ponder its precious moments with a deer in the forest, orits many pointed observations on the fragile nature ofTrust and Responsibility, and you have a tale for the ages
1435;Bearing the commentary of Bird and many of hisassociates, the film has many informative extras whichgreatly enhances one's appreciation for the enormoustask successfully accomplished by director, cast, andcrew.
1436;ups and character play of Warner Bros. cartooneryat its finest.
1437;inspiring, THE IRON GIANT is a phenomena to beexperienced by each and every one of us all.
1438;Really, a great animated film equaled only by Bird's other films, the Pixar oeuvre, Miyazaki, maybe the occasional Disney film, and perhaps a few stray features here and there.
1439;But I predict it will become a cult classic along the lines of many of the great anime flicks from Japan.
1440;this movie has everything .
1441;it's a great movie and my grandsons love it !
1442;Which, now that I think about it, encompasses the whole experience of anything viewed in a theatre or on a television, so I guess I do have something against it.
1443;I'm sure that the fans of it all have great reasons for watching it, and they all obviously love it to bits.
1444;the type that's dissatisfied with everything he sees.
1445;it still rises head and shoulders above almost everything else in its path, like the 50.
1446;Every single frame of film has been put together with the most meticulous of skill and detail, every single snippet of dialouge is perfectly suited to the situation and character, and every joke, every plot twist, every event grows organically out of the premise.
1447;The smoothness and clarity of CGI combined with the warmth and simplicity of hand.
1448;a movie everyone will enjoy, and a technical achievment any animator, from ANY country, could learn a thing or two from.
1449;The Iron Giant is a well made and satisfying animated film that both children and adults can enjoy.
1450;All my grandchildren ages 5.16 loves this movie .
1451;this was a very good story to the end.
1452;This video was surprisingly well done.
1453;It's a great story and the animation was wonderful.
1454;it can be a wonderful film with a real heart that looks at a serious subject and considers it in a thoughtful and even.
1455;It can present a leading character who is thoroughly human .
1456;It can be a film set in a period of paranoia and suspicion that was still a simpler and quieter time, and it can perfectly capture that time.
1457;It can have scary moments and funny moments and moments of pathos and of love and warmth.
1458;headed and actually thinks before he shoots.
1459;It can pay tribute to the wonderful cheesy films we all loved in the Fifties (especially the original Invaders from Mars and The Day the Earth Stood Full ).
1460;And that's how it could be a great movie.
1461;One of the best kids movies ever!
1462;Excellent story with an excellent ending.
1463;This is a great movie for kids and adults like.
1464;I laughed out loud at many scenes!
1465;You will enjoy it as much as we have.
1466;year old son absolutely loves this movie.
1467;I think he relates to the young boy who is the protagonist, but mostly I think he is fascinated by the gentle yet powerful iron giant.
1468;he watches this movie over and over and it has displaced Sesame Street, Pixar films and Disney films as his favorite.
1469;It has a great storyline and it's a great family friendly movie.
1470;I am a huge animated movie buff and this is a definate keeper.
1471;I went to see it in the theater with my then 4 year old niece and we loved it.
1472;When it came out on video we bought it right away (so I have the little action figure).
1473;I have recommended this movie to all my adult friends who appreciate good animation and every one of them has thanked me for it.
1474;One friend, a big burly macho kinda guy, even admitted to tearing up when the Iron Giant says """"Superman""""."""
1475;You just gotta see it!
1476;I saw it in the theatre with my little brother when it first came out and I have always loved it since.
1477;My son loves robots and the iron giant is a cut above all other robots.
1478;i have to say that, compared to the silly pictures and cheapquels Disney was churning out during the same time period (except for the excellent Fantasia 2000), this is really good.
1479;packed animated movies, some might find this movie kinda slow and underwhelming.
1480;I don't usually get so caught up in a movie, that I will shed a tear for the character, but the characters in this movie are so effective, you can't help, but love them.
1481;Most Disney movies are not this genuine and heart.
1482;Disney does turn out some good films, just not in this calibur.
1483;Everything in this movie was perfectly woven together, the story the characters, the animation.
1484;This is a gem of a film, and one that I will hold closley to my heart.
1485;classical animation's swan song with a strong message.
1486;The relationship that develops between the boy and the robot becomes very strong.
1487;This movie cannot simply be brushed aside as a cartoon, it is an incredible movie, and you may even forget that's what you are actually watching.
1488;kids love it, adults love it.
1489;great movie with a great message.
1490;You will be handsomely rewarded with an excellent experience.
1491;With the voice talents of Vin Diesel, Harry Connick Jr., and Jennifer Aniston, this movie attempts to introduce an element of Science Fiction, but with a heart.
1492;I will not ruin it for you, but will say that the presentation is spot on, and it has a happy ending.
1493;Excellent for all ages and genders.
1494;My son loves this movie, and I did, too, but there are two instances where adult language is used.
1495;"My son loves the ""Giant"" and there is a great storyline, so we'll watch it again, and again."
1496;I do appreciate that, and it's done very well.
1497;Geez as a four year old I loved it.
1498;It's a great movie for almost all ages, and I think it'll surprise you.
1499;it is a cute movie and the grandson liked it.
1500;All my children love this movie.
1501;My family LOVES this movie!
1502;It's a favorite in our house for sure!
1503;My daughter loved the movie.
1504;It is a step up from regular cartoon.
1505;This is an outstanding cartoon, feature.
1506;It's set in the 1950s during the Sputnik period and tells a delightful story of a boy that befriends a giant, metal alien form outer space!
1507;The story line and graphics or very good.
1508;I'm a teacher and have shown this film to kids and they love it.
1509;Yep this is indeed one the of the best American Animated films ever.
1510;Surely the best this year.
1511;It's just the Disney name that keeps them alive.
1512;This is one of the best American animated films of all time, but not generally one of the best animated movies of all time, no way.
1513;It's going to be the first of it's kind.
1514;Sure this is a great animated film, but it just can't compare to Japanimation/Anime in particular.
1515;I mean this is still a kids movie, just like all the other American animation.
1516;This movie is really good.
1517;My 3 year old buddy Preston loves this movie, he calls it Hogarth.
1518;Cool Movie, animations is old school Disney with a cool story.
1519;Great for kids and adults alike.
1520;A classic movie in the sense that it connects on various levels with the movie.
1521;Hands down one of my favorite animated movies of all time.
1522;hopping after seeing Star Wars: Episode One.
1523;Years later it has become a staple of family entertainment.
1524;Enter Hogarth Hughes who lives alone with his single.
1525;Trust me: once you watch The Iron Giant once, you'll watch it again and again and again!
1526;This movie truly Rox!Dig it!
1527;A wonderful emotional childrens' story about relationship built with a robot that actually has a soul.
1528;It is a touching story with a surprising end.
1529;What I want to say is that there is a reason this story is so affecting.
1530;This is a powerful retelling of a world.
1531;It is not my personal myth, but it is a profoundly spiritual story.
1532;And unlike more pretentious movies, and especially, novels, the mythic or spiritual aspect is not obvious.
1533;I laughed and cried, and that is unusual for me.
1534;Ted Hughes is a fine poet, but this movie is, for once, much, much better than the book.
1535;"While there isn't as much action as there was in ""The Incredibles"" (though there is some), the film is both funny and moving, and the strong story, great voice performances (especially by Eli Marienthal, who plays the boy), and beautiful 2."
1536;"d animation result in what is my favorite animated film of all time (a distinction which is impressive considering I'm a huge Disney fan and ""The Iron Giant"" was released by Warner Bros.)."
1537;town somewhere in Maine during the 1950s.
1538;Anyway, this movie has good animation and a decent story that left room for a sequel at the end.
1539;It's SO GOOD it's brings a smile to my face every time I see it.
1540;It makes me enjoy good story telling.
1541;With great voice acting and a touching message that can make you cry.
1542;the Iron Giant is one of the best animation movies heck movies ever!
1543;This is an excellent story for kids with mild violence.
1544;In the end the iron giant gives his life to save the young boy's town.
1545;The Iron Giant is just a really feel good movie with real values that don't get instilled in any of those lame Disney cartoons about murder and death in the family.
1546;This is a happy movie that everyone should watch because it's truly enjoyable and suitable for everyone.
1547;I really enjoyed this movie even though I'm well pass the age it was targeted for.
1548;And so do my kids.
1549;My son has loved this movie since he was born!
1550;in the film, set during the Cold War, and presenting a wonderful portrait of the 50s atmosphere, the enemy is US .
1551;I think that this is, in the end, more profound.
1552;In the film, the robot is just a cool robot from outer space, that human beings can choose to make a friend or to establish as an enemy.
1553;in any case, this is easily one of the best animated films to come out of the United States in the last decade (and one of the others is by the same director, Brad Bird).
1554;The story and animation have aged well, thankfully, and the story of friendship is timeless.
1555;If you're looking for a pretty decent animated movie for the kids, look no further.
1556;disc Collector's Edition)is a winner!
1557;The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films to come out of the US, it's a must see for all fans of animated cinema and movie making in general!
1558;When one thinks of studios that specialize in animated movies, Disney, Pixar, and to a lesser extent Dreamworks comes to mind.
1559;Surprising then that one of the best animated films of the past 30 years was a non.
1560;Starring Vin Diesel as the voice of the title character, this movie takes place at the height of the Cold War somewhere along the eastern seaboard.
1561;The movie features both comedy and tragedy, and includes some subtle commentary on politics, pop psychology and other features of American society.
1562;But overall, a good movie.
1563;Truly one of the greatest animated films of all time (not Lion King)!
1564;This film has it all and more: A robot who found out there's more to him than just defense.
1565;a sensitive child who befriends the robot with true loyalty.
1566;There are pleanty of good gags in this movie to keep adults laughing with wit and insight (some that mocks our country's past with the Cold War).
1567;I HIGHLY recommend this movie to ANYONE!
1568;Anybody wanna see a movie with great humor, a touching story, and some good animation?
1569;It is my favorite animated movie and although a few good ones have come along since then, I can't see anything else ever topping this one.
1570;I owned it many years before my son was born.
1571;My four year old son and I watch it together and he loves it as much as I do.
1572;It's a good wholesome movie with a lot of heart.
1573;The story and lesson are fabulous, it is entertaining and endearing.
1574;It transcends age groups well, with something for everyone.
1575;What a way to capture children's attention than a giant robot, and what a way to please mom, with a message and an endearing mother figure.
1576;It also somehow manages to be humorous without vulgarity or inuendo (imagine that!)
1577;I would have been so dissappointed if I could not have gotten my 2 year old to watch and enjoy this, he is prone to really only like the super computer animated movies, but thank goodness he loves it too, he's now three and a half and we watch it all the time and are in the process of teaching his one and a half year old brother to love it too!
1578;"Additionally, it is great for school, social or church groups or centers, as it is a true ""G"" rated movie."
1579;I'm sure he'd give it 5 stars.
1580;I bought this for my kids, but my wife and I enjoyed it as much as they did.
1581;This film explores the idea of a machine having a soul.
1582;Everything is outstanding: the animation, the music, the plot, the voiceovers.
1583;An old but always great movie for the entire family.
1584;My children and their friends enjoy watching this movie over and over during the holidays.
1585;My grandkids love this movie!
1586;This movie is very much worth watching.
1587;I thought it was funny as a kid and I still think its awesome as an adult.
1588;characterization, drama, plot all vastly superior.
1589;Excellent movie for children 6 and older as well as teens and adults.
1590;This is my childrens and grandchildrens favorite movie.
1591;This is probably the most pushed aside movie of 1999, and one of the best animated films out there.
1592;It has a wonderful story that will appeal to people of all ages.
1593;It's a story about friendship, when a young boy finds a giant robot a befriends him.
1594;Even though the robot is made of metal, it has a soul, and the young boy will do anything it takes to protect him from people who don't understand.
1595;One of the best animated films ever.
1596;Whoever designed the robot did a fantastic job.
1597;from beginning to the end, it is funny, witty, entertaining, moving, and powerful.
1598;A Thanks to the geniuses who created this movie.
1599;I bought this to show to my students during the last few days of the school year.
1600;There were some misty eyes, but they loved it!
1601;This has got to be one of the best Disney movies ever.

1621;The film is full of humor.
1622;The scene where Dean has to unzip his pants to let out Hogarth's new pet is hilarious.

1624;The animation was superb and the soundtrack was full of 50s gems.
1625;A great film with a great story.
1626;It was a really good movie with many important ideas.
1627;I would recommend it to both children and adults to broaden there way of thinking about issues.

1629;This movie touched me on levels that most don't.
1630;wonderful animation and voice talent.
1631;Vin Deisel has NEVER been in a movie THIS good.
1632;if you like The Lone Ranger,Mighty Joe Young and of course SUPERMAN(the Giants Idol),you'll love this.

1678;My kids (girl and boy, ages 8 and 6) love this movie.
1679;I'm also impressed with the creative ideas and artwork.
1680;Animation and story line enhance the original story.
1681;Message of moving past fear and war is a strong incentive to view.
1682;It's extremely well crafted, fast.
1683;As I have a small child, I have seen this film perhaps thirty times, and I look forward to the next.
1684;This movie is entrancing for the children because of the connection between the iron giant and Hogarth, but the emotionally realistic story line and characters is captivating for adults.
1685;This is the most emotional animated film since The Land Before Time .
1686;the animation is superb, plot, and morals are great.
1687;this has to be one of the best, if not THE best film of '99.
1688;This is the finest animation on the North American Continent.
1689;The animation is truely fantastic in.
1690;This movie is great for young people and older people.
1691;People who knew the 50's Cold War will really enjoy the way this movie pokes fun at how bad the propaganda used to be.
1692;I bought this movie for my boyfriend because it is his favorite movie.
1693;It is so cute and you just fall in love with the characters.
1694;This is an ok movie at best.
1695;Great movie and I am very glad to add this to my superhero and animation collection!
1696;The Iron Giant looks fantastic, is well written, and even packs a wallop in the soundtrack department.
1697;This movie is intelligent and provides the viewer with important questions to ponder while simultaneously avoiding the trap of soap.
1698;There is violence and death, but both are dealt with in a graceful and instructive manner.
1699;How often does that family find adventure, soul, and meaningful friendship so skillfully presented?
1700;This movie is as good, if not better, than any other film that has come out in the last year, bar none.
1701;It is very entertaining for adults and children alike.
1702;The end could be upsetting for very young children, but watch it with them so you can talk to them afterwards and it will be ok.
1703;You will be glad you did, and you'll want to see it again.
1704;This is a movie for all to enjoy.
1705;But this is a far better movie in content and design than anything Disney has produced in the last several years, perhaps the decade.
1706;All of the characters were well done.
1707;And it is a breath of fresh air to have a (very, very) funny kids movie WITHOUT forced, saccharin.
1708;The characters displayed emotions that were convincing (even.
1709;The ending made my eyes water, my girlfriend cried, and my cynical, sourpuss brother whispered wow!
1710;That is powerful, powerful knowledge for the Iron Giant, as it is for everyone.
1711;"That message is what makes the movie a true ""must see"" for all ages."
1712;You are who you choose to be is an empowering statement of personal freedom to be the best we were meant to be.
1713;But with the will to do so, it can be done.
1714;friends can help us see our true selves and potentials.
1715;At his metallic heart, the Iron Giant is a gentle, sensitive creature, and when Hogarth extends the hand of friendship, the Iron Giant truly blossoms.
1716;"Hogarth's faith in the Iron Giant helps the metal man have faith in himself and helps him hold the image of himself as a ""good guy"" and not a programmed ""gun."""
1717;The Iron Giant and Hogarth are tremendous role models for self.
1718;The truly is a great story, giving you the feel of the 50's .
1719;My daughter loved this movie.
1720;It is a must have, its just a great story.
1721;Kids really enjoyed this movie and I was so excited that it was on the instant view list for Prime members!
1722;Just wish Prime offered more good kids movies!
1723;My whole family loves this movie!
1724;The story is great, even brings a tear to my husband's eye!
1725;I loved this when I was young and after all these years I still think its great!
1726;The story, for the most part, was well done and the voice acting was top notch!
1727;Forever a child at heart!
1728;This is a highly underated film that deserved alot more theater time than it got.
1729;It's got great satirical comments on the atomic age paranoia, a cute sense of humor that would make even adults snicker, and a truly touching ending that would make even the souless shed a tear.
1730;Jennifer Aniston makes a great vocal actress as Hogarth's mom, Eli Marienthal does a superb job on his performance as the wide.
1731;eyed kid, Hogarth, and Harry Connick Jr makes the cool cat, Dean, look cooler.
1732;It was a decent add.
1733;Night scenes and space scenes were very sharp and crisp.
1734;This is one feature that should be in everyone's collection.
1735;we had already seen the Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
1736;ray edition is available from Amazon.
1737;hopefully you'll enjoy this film as much as we did.
1738;Nice story about friendship and loyalty.
1739;This is a very good heart warming family movie.
1740;I really love this movie.
1741;I loved the start with the WB shield in the old cartoon cirlces.
1742;The story was pleasant and not preachy.
1743;I also loved the fact that even though the story was set in Maine there weren't any phony accents.
1744;What an absolutely amazing animated movie.
1745;This has to be one of the best animated movies of all time, right up there with Toy Story and others like it.
1746;the balance of humor, character depth, a budding romance between Hogarths mom and Dean, the sweet innocence and humility of the robot itself and how he CHOOSES to be more like Superman and sacrifice himself for his friends and loved ones is a classic and all to rare trait today, whether in a human or a machine.
1747;All my brothers in their 30's and 40's were deeply moved by the sweetness, action, comedy, suspense and great animation in this movie.
1748;Other than that this movie is absolutely perfect and one that I enjoy watching over and over again.
1749;For someone in their upper 30's who never watched cartoons much to say that is a testament to how good this movie is.
1750;"Director Brad Bird (The Simpsons and The Incredibles) surpasses some of Disney's finest with the highly entertaining animated adventure ""The Iron Giant""."
1751;In the dawn of the Cold War, a spirited New England boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) forms a strong friendship with a gigantic metal.
1752;"Based on the 1968 children's book, ""The Iron Giant"" is a superbly enjoyable animated treasure."
1753;Though the animated movie failed in theaters, it received great critical praise and a good cult following upon home video release and television airings.
1754;The underrated family film contains a well written story, memorable characters, great humor and a strong morale message.
1755;The Iron Giant Special Edition is a notable improvement over its previous release.
1756;Cute kids movie for all ages.
1757;Our son, neices and nephews enjoy it.
1758;helped by his beatnik friend Dean who creates art at the local junkyard, Hogarth pits his skills against this agent, who wonderfully captures every shade of prejudice humankind can show .
1759;"Everyone loves watching ""helpless"" kids being pitted up against ""older, wiser"" adults, and in this case the conflict doesn't disappoint ."
1760;"the final message ""You are what you choose to be"" is beautifully worked up to when the Giant realises that he reacts defensively to any attack upon him, and when the military is called in, he is devastated at the thought of being merely a gun."
1761;The climax is something I can't give away, but it is a beautiful ending to a powerful story.
1762;Voice acting is good on all fronts, from the adequate Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr as Annie and Dean, to the then.
1763;And you care about things.
1764;Full of wonder, warmth, heroism, humor and sadness.
1765;Great opening with sputnik (what do the beeps mean? )
1766;good flotsam, I was delighted to discover a brilliantly conceived and animated film with great subtlety and nuance.
1767;If you have dry eyes at the end of the film you are not human, which speaks to the power of really good animation and filmmaking in general.
1768;the voices (Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, John Mahoney, etc.) are all perfect for their roles, and the animation is truly breathtaking.
1769;This is better than anything Disney has made in the last twenty years or so, and Warner Brothers should be proud of this film and use it as a model for what a truly good animated picture can be.
1770;Although children will enjoy the film, expect it to generate major questions from them.
1771;Some of the humor will slide right past younger children, but never fear, the adults will love it.
1772;i highly recommend this film to children and adults alike.
1773;This is a truly brilliant production, and I enthusiastically give it five stars!
1774;We bought this movie for the kids, but after watching it the first time, we knew that this was one my wife and I could enjoy just as much as the kids.
1775;The basic plot of the movie is this: The Iron Giant, an alien robot of tremendous size and power, crash.
1776;written, with a lot of absolutely hilarious comedy as well as some real tear.
1777;an EXCELLENT movie, which everyone can enjoy.
1778;The movie is terrific and is worth 5.
1779;It is incompatible with Windows!
1780;THE IRON GIANT (1999) is so wonderful, so full of magic, so heart.
1781;Academy, please take note when you cast your ballot.
1782;Those people who did see THE IRON GIANT were touched by it, thrilled by it, BLOWN AWAY by it.
1783;Brad Bird, please take a bow.
1784;This was an early Brad Bird film, and it's a testament to the magic that the director weaves into his movies.
1785;Everything really comes together in this movie.
1786;I just love this movie!
1787;It does a great job of revealing that A. He's a Good Guy and B.
1788;this is a good movie .
1789;I'm surprised at how many film and animation buffs have not see this movie.
1790;It is a must own instant classic, because you will watch it again and again.
1791;The irony about this film is that the reason it is so well done, is a result of it not getting adequate advertising and promotion when it was released.
1792;this film is one of my top 3 films of all time, and not just animated films.
1793;It has emotion, heart, drama, tension and wonderful characters along with tremendous animation.
1794;great film and was well done for the time period when it was produced.
1795;Great movie for the whole family.
1796;the animation is lovely, the characters interesting and entertaining and a very good story which gets the viewer involved right away.
1797;Children as well as adults will love this movie.
1798;They should make a sequel to it.
1799;Recommend it for all age groups.
1800;transcended age, genre, and form to establish animation as a viable medium through which to convey deep philosophical truths.
1801;I just love the jazz loving metal artist junkyard operator.
1802;This movie is excellent and has a really good message.
1803;My wife and I love to watch it with our son.
1804;The animation and story are excellent!
1805;I first watched this movie on netflix, i have to say my kids love this movie, it was a great price for the movie.
1806;The Iron Giant is quite a charmer in its own right as well.
1807;It is a rare pleasure to see an animated film so rooted in the real world.
1808;So many of them take us to such exotic places .
1809;By setting this film in the recognizable world of 1950's America, the makers establish a tone of unfrenetic charm and tranquility that plays well as a background for the sci.
1810;The film also becomes a beautiful reflection on the strange coexistence of scientific idealism and trepidation that took hold of the imagination in that early era of space exploration and nuclear gamesmanship .
1811;the dialogue in the film enhances the gentle tone of the story without resorting to either maudlin sentimentalilty or sardonic cynicism.
1812;Hogarth, the boy, is simply a curious, well intentioned young lad, a bit smarter than most perhaps but not a budding genius (one of the wittiest lines comes when he bemoans the fact that other boys tease him because he is so much smarter than them when really the only difference is that he STUDIES).
1813;The Iron Giant manages to instill a number of such subtle life lessons as these without straining the point or becoming pedantic about it .
1814;the use of widescreen yields a number of tremendously beautiful moments of visual splendour, and the giant himself is especially impressive.
1815;but it is definitely a film well worth seeing, an animated film that will indeed appeal to audiences of all ages.
1816;What a pleasant surprise this film was.
1817;We still love to watch it and were thrilled that it was on Amazon for us to stream.
1818;i liked it , and the picture was great.
1819;I think there is something really cool , bout the way it is made as well.
1820;Also the fact it is about the 50's adds to it, as to how innocent we once were.
1821;I love that the movie's messages (guns kill people and you are what you choose to be) are blended into the story so well that my son understands them.
1822;It is an excellent movie for all ages.
1823;Great movie for both kids and adults!
1824;This has got to be one of the funniest kids movie I have seen in a long time and it never gets old!
1825;she loves everything about it.
1826;shes 2 years old and all she talks about is this movie
1827;All 10 of my grandchildren absolutely love this movie.
1828;It has a great message for them.
1829;I reccommrnd it for all ages
1830;This movie has something for everyone.
1831;A sad climax coupled with a happy ending.
1832;Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece.
1833;That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation.
1834;the story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET.
1835;The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had.
1836;What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice.
1837;In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder.
1838;It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling.
1839;Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment.
1840;The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps.
1841;"Hogarth is an optimistic young man
1842;And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the """"duck and cover"""" instructional in school every year of his short life."""
1843;The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.
1844;along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent.
1845;Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination.
1846;Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant.
1847;"The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War
1848;And the main story itself is also simple.
1849;What makes this movie terrific is its heart.
1850;It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non.
1851;My daughter loves it and has watched it over and over again.
1852;It's something even her older siblings will watch with her.
1853;Both my 15 year old step daughter and my 3 year old son love this movie.
1854;Good message and beautifully done.
1855;:) He'll be so excited!
1856;This movie was a big hit for my 3 and 5 year old boys.
1857;I was initially concerned the theme of the movie might be too advanced or portions of the movie too scary, but both seemed to understand and enjoy it.
1858;the lil guys really enjoyed it!
1859;They watched it without interruption, and that is a good thing!Thanks Amazon, you are the best!!
1860;I thought this movie was excellent for ages 3 on up.
1861;I recommend it over a lot of the recent Disney movies.
1862;The art, emotion, care, near obsession with detail, show just how brilliant, the drama, light and shade, in a story context can be crafted into a superb masterpiece.
1863;Whilst it is a very family friendly film, the adult accessibility for this film can resonate on many planes.
1864;There are so very many layers in the project, that it is just magical"
1865;The various characters behind the film, the commentary, the featurette series, and the whole set of extras make the package a brilliant piece.
1866;I love The Iron Giant and I was happy to find it in the same price range that I did at the previous mentioned store.
1867;Inspiring look at understanding and believing in the beauty of humanity through the eyes of an adolescent robot, the Iron Giant.
1868;What a great story and a thrilling ending.
1869;I believe that decades from now when film school students study the history of American animation, the Iron Giant will be seen as perhaps the last great example of traditionally hand.
1870;drawn animated movies, before the switch to computer animation a la Finding Nemo.
1871;this movie is an example of what animated movies routinely accomplish in Japan, but rarely do here in the U. s. It's well written, visually impressive, and works for all ages, not just children.
1872;The climactic battle sequence features a potentially scary transformation of the Iron Giant.
1873;This is in the latter category: it's a keeper!
1874;friendly animation set in the '50's during the cold war.
1875;The voices for the characters are perfect, and the story is plausible and heart.
1876;We can all learn from each other that love and kindness can go a very long way.
1877;This is an amazing film.
1878;One of the best animated films ever.
1879;The characters stay true to their personalities.
1880;Jennifer Aniston puts in a great performance as does Harry Conick Jr.
1881;The entire cast was fantastic.
1882;If animation has a hope it is in stories like these.
1883;You will love this story.
1884;I take issue with both of these counts because they are story appropriate.
1885;If you can see the morals, the true value(s) of this film will give you something enjoy and share with your loved ones.
1886;"It's so well made and the story is beautiful
1887;my favorite thing about The Iron Giant is the way the relationship between the boy and Giant are portrayed.
1888;A refreshing and intelligent change.
1889;pace from the usual Disney fare, this provocative adaptation of Ted Hughes' work represents a landmark in animation history.
1890;The Iron Giant transcends the medium to make a timely pacifist statement.
1891;Honestly one of the most boring films of all time, nothing amusing or funny about it, do yourself a favor and watch a Disney movie instead
1892;Great film for kids and adults.
1893;The story is told very well and the """"cinematography"""" is wonderful."""
1894;YES, I would recommend this to family and friends and anyone else!
1895;If you or your kids love animation/cartoon, this is a movie for them!
1896;Thank you again for everything!
1897;great until it got to it's anti.
1898;The story is a sweet tale of a robot/rocket/warrior that crashes into a forest.
1899;for years I made fun of the hubby for both, so it was a big surprise for both of us after seeing this movie and me actually sobbing uncontrollably out loud!
1900;But this Iron Giant does just that and incredibly well .
1901;the animation, the voice, the story, all done so well.
1902;I was touched by this movie like I've never been and I never thought I would be able to sit through an animated kiddie movie.
1903;This one's a definite must see for everyone.
1904;I laughed, I cried, I must see it again and again!
1905;My grandkids watch it over and over again.
1906;Even my hubby and myself enjoy watching it.
1907;There are some parts that are a bit frightening for really little children but they turn out well in the end.
1908;This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1909;"It is a great movie for the ""whole"" family."
1910;My girls and I have seen this movie numerous times and it remains a top request in our family.
1911;fashioned (as here) or CGI, and I do love this movie despite my reservations.
1912;"The iron giant himself is a very moving character
1913;This movie really surprised me.
1914;I'm 16 years old and it was my younger brother who received this movie for Christmas.
1915;You fall in love with Hogarth and the Iron Giant and I even shed tears at the end!
1916;My whole family loved the movie and I would definately recommend it to anyone who wishes to see a truly well made movie with classic music, and a plot that isn't predictable.
1917;Do yourself a solid and pick this movie up somewhere.
1918;iron giant is the best animated feature film since jungle book,this is in comparison to disney and warner bros films made after jungle book.
1919;the good thing is that the animation in the film is not unnecessarily rubbery like most animated features today,but its perfect for the story,the 3.
1920;d robot is superbly designed to blend in with the 2.
1921;it shows since all the hands drawn for the characters are much better than what exists in contemporary animation art.
1922;the character designs are very slick and add to the story.
1923;if youre a layman this movie will move you .
1924;The film that vanished from theaters in 1999 faster than you could say """"best reviews of the year"""" has finally been granted special edition status."""
1925;On the other hand, it's quite a coincidence that the release coincided with the appearance of his latest project, the also well.
1926;Everyone knows that it's a great film, but how does the new deluxe version hold up?Not so well, I have to admit.
1927;That should make fans happy, and it's long overdue (the story of Warner's unwillingness to fund the project from day one is well.
1928;And like I said, it's a brilliant film that.
1929;is as timely as timeless.
1930;Looks like Warner Brothers is still committed to pinching pennies with this one, but The Iron Giant is a movie that will only gain status with the passage of time, and it's dynamite viewing for children and adults.
1931;five stars for the film, which is a bona fide American classic of animation that is as entertaining as it is educational.
1932;This may be a film for kids, but it's certainly for adults as well.
1933;this is definitely a classic and a keeper!
1934;I had great reservations about seeing The Iron Giant considering the very poor job Warner Brothers has done on other feature length animated movies.
1935;But this is the best animated movie I have ever seen.
1936;Hogarth is such an amazing and endearing boy.
1937;A great example to my sons.
1938;He has humor, charm, daring and a big heart.
1939;Tragically, that happened with The Iron Giant this year and it's a motion picture that is deserving of any number of awards.
1940;a friend and I howled with laughter and cheered throughout our first time with The Iron Giant and we're two 30 year old guys, so you can easily imagine a child's eyes lighting up.
1941;just a very special story about a young boy and his new friend growing up a little.
1942;I loved it as a kid, and still do.
1943;Brad Bird is a genius!
1944;Feel that it is a good family movie.
1945;Brad Bird is one of my favorite directors.
1946;He captured the time period perfectly.
1947;This is a family movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children.
1948;hogarth is an imaginative little boy being raised by his single mother.
1949;Hogarth develops a friendship with the metal giant but soon realizes he has a dangerous side.
1950;But it has such a beautiful message at the end.
1951;The animation is just superbly done.
1952;The emotion is captured so well in the characters and I love the 1950's feel.You will not be disappointed in this movie regardless of your age.
1953;This was just a really neat, cute movie.
1954;Not fabulous, but still worth watching.
1955;The storyline was unique and imaginative.
1956;I didn't know that this movie was all cartoon, however, it is very endearing and sweet.
1957;The good guys win and the bad guys get their just desserts.
1958;I love this movie and now my son does as well!
1959;It's such a good movie!
1960;I enjoyed this film so much I'm probably going to watch it a second time in the same day.
1961;It reminds me of the fantasy and wonder that I had as a child exploring the woods of my neighborhood, and really made me feel like a kid again.
1962;If you enjoyed this story, I'd recommend the animated film How To Train Your Dragon.
1963;Both movies that really bring out the kid in you.
1964;This film, based on a children's novella by the late Ted Hughes, is a beautifully rendered, thoughtfully written, carefully assembled cinematic gem.
1965;hogarth Hughes is an imaginative pre.
1966;He befriends Dean, a beatnik with a big heart, who lives in and runs the local junkyard.
1967;in the end, thanks to some great voice acting by Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., and Vin Diesel (nearly unrecognizable as the giant), along with some very wonderful production design and masterful direction by Brad Bird, this film brings a marvelous message with it.
1968;If you see it, I hope you choose to listen.
1969;This is the type of wondrous film that I yearned for as a kid.
1970;I still enjoyed it as an adult.
1971;Yet it still gets to you, and makes you wide eyed and young at heart.
1972;In a time when so much pap and so much garbage is being cranked out by Hollywood, along comes a real gem.
1973;It is touching, funny, exciting and altogether delightful.
1974;Despite it's poor box office returns, The Iron Giant is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.
1975;The animation is top notch and voice performances are some of the best in an animated feature.
1976;Every time I watch this film I notice another subtle detail.
1977;Everyone knows the close bond that can form between a boy and his dog.
1978;"Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant"" is a chronicle of such a bond ."
1979;"What results is a charming film full of wit and clever political commentary that outshines everything Disney has put out since ""Beauty and the Beast."""
1980;"With the inclusion of G. men, B. grade monster films, Cold War paranoia, beatniks, Sputnik, Superman comics, and nuclear bomb drills, ""The Iron Giant"" is also a loving tribute to the bygone 1950's."
1981;"the one element that elevates ""The Iron Giant"" from other recent animated fare is its sophistication of story."
1982;This film is an ambitious attempt to educate viewers who were not even alive in the 1950's about that decade and an entertaining nostalgia trip for adults who actually lived through that unique period.
1983;The Iron Giant is a worthwhile film experience for young and old alike.
1984;The greatest kids film ever.
1985;Better than ziploc divided lunch containers.
1986;I saw this movie a few years ago and forgot about it.
1987;I saw that Amazon had it for a great price so I ordered it for my nephew and he loves it.
1988;He is going to be 8 years old and my sister called me the other day to tell me that he loves the movie and has watched it many times already.
1989;I think this is nice for the kids.
1990;I got it for my grandchildren in Texas and Washington.
1991;I don't often call a movie perfect.
1992;It is subtle, elegant, luminous, and completely satisfying, for members of the generation who grew up in the 50's especially.
1993;If you are an adult, treat yourself to a movie which will make you laugh, cry, and spark your soul.
1994;Thanks to the director for this real work of art and heart.
1995;This is one of those films that comes along once in a great while.
1996;A film that captures the imagination no matter how old you are.
1997;This film is for everyone.
1998;They love it because of the robot.
1999;I think I enjoyed it more than my kids (5 and 3).
2000;A refreshing change from the old Disney formula.
2001;I definitely want to own this film.
2002;This is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.
2003;The 1950's setting is well realized from the Cold War fears to the kids' obsession with superhero comic books.
2004;Several important themes are examined including the value of non.
2005;"Despite the sometimes serious ideas presented there are many scenes that are ""laugh out loud"" funny."
2006;the movie is welled voiced with Harry Connick Jr. perfect as Dean the beatnik/artist/scrap dealer and Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's attractive mother.
2007;Hogarth is fully developed as a smart kid missing his dad, and enduring resentment from his less intelligent peers.
2008;Now my grandchildren (3) watch it and love it.
2009;It is a wonderful story and truly heartwarming.
2010;In fact this is my son's (who is now 18) favorite movie of all times.
2011;My boys, 3 and 4, both loved The Iron Giant.
2012;We had a good experience ordering from Amazon, as always.
2013;And I was pleasantly surprised to rediscover just how sweet, lovely and entertaining this charming should.
2014;All are well drawn (literally and figuratively), fully realized characters that bring this lovely tale to life.
2015;I found myself crying at the end and we've watched it several times since.
2016;I even bought this extra copy for the car.
2017;this is one of those rare kids' films that you won't mind watching again and again, and can feel good to have them re.
2018;around winner that really should be better known!
2019;The animation is as good (or better!)
2020;d flick, and the Giant himself is a CGI 2.
2021;If you like comic book films, sci.
2022;fi films, animated films, or extremely well.
2023;It has it all: smarts, heart, artistry, humor and a powerful message.
2024;Co. adapter/director Brad Bird (The Incredibles/Ratatouille/Mission Impossible III) is his own brand of genius.
2025;My 5 and 6 year old children love this movie.
2026;and that's all that really matters.
2027;the movie is inspiring to the young and old.
2028;We love the characters and find it to be a sweet story.
2029;Hogarth is a fun main character.
2030;The Iron Giant offers something for everyone and sends a powerful message on our ability to decide right from wrong.
2031;Children will identify with the relationship between Hogarth and the Iron Giant while getting a strong dose of right versus wrong.
2032;Adults will appreciate the movie's moral message, excellent animation and humor.
2033;This is by far the most entertaining animated film ever made.
2034;One of very few animated films I actually like.
2035;The action around the end absolutely rocked and the characters were believeable and just simply great.
2036;I truly hope for a sequel.
2037;I have to admit, I really liked this movie myself.
2038;It has a good story line and character base.
2039;It is really a wonderful heart.
2040;The whole family in my house loves this movie.
2041;Set in the cold war 1950s, The Iron Giant is a beautifully animated movie that has heart, humor, imagination, action and adventure.
2042;The voice talent is top.
2043;notch, the storytelling original, and the picture and sound superb.
2044;It's the kind of movie adults and kids can enjoy together.
2045;A favorite of mine as a kid, picked it up to rehash some great memories with my brother and it still is just as sad as I remember!
2046;Such a good movie with so many good messages, a must have for anyone, kid to teenager to adult, pick this one up!
2047;I admit that I love these movies but would still like to see something slightly more original.
2048;Iron Giant has broken this mould and given us one of the best animated films ever.
2049;The answer to that is simply everything!
2050;"The story is far more intelligent and involving than most others
2051;The films characters are also great and the interaction between them provides many great moments.
2052;Films rarely make me cry but this one definately brought a tear or two to my eyes.
2053;It offers amazing 5.1 digital sound which picks up the tiniest of detail in the movies stunning soundtrack, giving an enjoyable assault on your ears.
2054;This is an all round great film, perfect for those family evenings .
2055;So well done Warner Bros"
2056;this film is for everyone and i think everyone should see it.
2057;i highly recommend this cartoon that has laughs and a great message.
2058;My son and I wanted to watch a movie and this one was recommended on Amazon Prime.
2059;I absolutely love this movie!
2060;Great story and strong message.
2061;Great movie for the entire family.
2062;Definitely recommend adding this to your movie library.
2063;Like the best children's movies, equally entertaining to adults.
2064;This is such a good movie that more people should share with there kids.
2065;RJ: I have seen alot of animated movies before but this one is one of the best.
2066;the story is really good,the characters were all fun to watch,voice acting was exellent and the moral is a very good one.
2067;i would recommand this movie to all ages it is a movie worth watching and worth having in your collectionRaymond:Its a good movie,great for the family,all time favorite.
2068;The Iron Giant is quite a unique cartoon.
2069;The first time I watched was in 2000, and at that time I viewed it on VHS.
2070;The plot is quite intricate, as a boy named Hogarth finds a giant tangled in a power station.
2071;The themes presented at the end of the movie are thought.
2072;Lots of stars doing the voices.
2073;Its an older movie, but my son loves it!
2074;My kids really enjoy this film.
2075;I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie.
2076;Brad's gift for writing and directing is evident here in what I believe is his first full length movie.
2077;It has a touching family.
2078;oriented story line, fleshed out with the voice talents of Aniston and Connick.
2079;My 6 year old son is into everything to do with robots.
2080;In fact, it is the first time I saw my son have tears in his eyes at the end of a movie and that was not a bad thing because the tears are due to the amazing sacrifice of the robot.
2081;I think many adults will enjoy it (as most action movies out there are much more childish than this film).
2082;It is a story of how things are not necessarily completely evil or good, that a person set up for evil can become good, and in the end self.
2083;This can be a great conversion starter about the important issue of true heroism, about willing to sacrifice even your life for your family and for others.
2084;The ending of this movie has a lot of meaning and therefore is something many children will enjoy but will get a good message out of.
2085;It is a surprisingly anti.
2086;killing movie for a movie full of action and battle scenes worthy of any good superhero cartoon.
2087;Rare to see a cartoon these days which kids can enjoy and also be taught about virtue at the same time.
2088;But these are very rare indeed.
2089;Great for adults, and children.
2090;I have a child 9 years old and 16, I was surprized that both enjoyed it.
2091;Great meaning and lessons on life.
2092;My daughter loves this movie!
2093;"He loves the ""Giant Robot"" movie as he calls it."
2094;It is set in the 1950s we believe.
2095;Vin Diesel voices the robot!
2096;It is a bargain movie for such a great entertainment for them!
2097;It was the best animated movie because it had a good lesson and it was non.
2098;it does have a few bad words which effects the movie, but the movie was so good that I rated it five stars.
2099;Loved the fact that I could watch the movie before I received it.
2100;This film is proof that a good story, and great animation can really make you appreciate kid's movies .
2101;One nice thing is that this film does not include a song and dance number, or any talking animals voiced by semi famous celebrities.
2102;This film relies only on its own merit, and succeeds beautifully.
2103;Put together very nicely with an epic story line.
2104;Completely touches and warms the heart.
2105;My son as well as the whole family, thoroughly enjoyed it.
2106;My 8 yr old son and I watched this movie on a snow day.
2107;This is by far the finest work of animation/storyline that has ever come out of Warner Bros.
2108;This is a wonderful tale that transcends the genre!The sound and animation truly make you feel this movie!
2109;It is enough to take your breath away.
2110;The deep story in the film will keep adults cheering all the way through!
2111;brave, etc. you will like this movie despite the old.
2112;The story more than makes up for the traditional animation.
2113;I just enjoy animated pictures.
2114;I also enjoy watching this one a few times too.
2115;my little one lives this movie as he is very into robots right now.
2116;Well done animation that is engaging and period appropriate.
2117;Good film for the whole family, you'll want to cheer them on!
2118;I can`t believe i haven`t watched this incredible movie until now!
2119;I am really into all sorts of animation and with no doubt, this is one of the best.
2120;I especially liked the giant to identify himself with Superman.
2121;Actually, this movie offers a lot more than most live.
2122;I first saw Iron Giant when it came out on VHS and I've loved it ever since.
2123;"Ask anyone who's seen the movie about the ""Suuuuperman"" scene, and you'll know why it's one of the greatest moments in cinema."
2124;In 20 years, this movie will be considered a classic along the lines of It's a Wonderful Life.
2125;My 3 year old son and I love this movie.
2126;It is exciting enough to keep both his attention and mine.
2127;"Director Brad Bird, behind the Disney and Pixar's masterpiece ""The Incredibles"" directed Warner Bros. 1999 2D animated film ""the Iron Giant"" the touching story of young boy named Hogarth who befriends an innocent giant robot from outer space in 1957, the atomic age."
2128;"An extrodonary and touching movie, an animated E. t. but with a robot, a underrated masterpiece, if you like animated films see ""the Iron Giant"" featuring the voice talents of Jennifer Aninston, Harry Conick Jr."
2129;Like most young boys when they come across a giant robot is to make friends with it.
2130;This is one of the most heartfelt movies I have ever seen and it's not even a Disney movie.
2131;The characters are so well made and voices chosen really allow them to connect with the viewers.
2132;I loved how the movie really depicted the time of the innocent 1950's with all the pop culture references as well.
2133;Still the bond between Hogarth and the Iron Giant is heartwarming and real you will want to watch this movie again and again.
2134;The Iron giant is basically a scifi movie but has great heart and lots of morality and soul to it as well
2135;This superb work of film making art indeed brought tears to my eyes as well, with the touching depth of the soulful story that this film so wonderfully tells.
2136;i can only hope that more people have the opportunity to share the wonderment and feeling that this incredible work can evoke.
2137;share this film with someone you love of any age, there are two strong messages that you'll be sharing: the magic of still being able to touch the wonderment that lives inside each of us, and the concept of love itself.
2138;Amazing what a timeless classic this movie is.
2139;Small story the gets me every time I watch it.
2140;This was a sweet movie, with enough good and bad guys to keep it interesting.
2141;This is such an amazing movie that makes me cry every time I watch it.
2142;A definite must have for any animation fans, concept/design fans, robot fans, and fans of great stories.
2143;This movie absolutely exceeded every expectation I had for it.
2144;It is a wonderful and beautiful expression of all the parts transcending the art form.
2145;A truly touching and moving story, likeable and believable characters, and GREAT animation .
2146;from the seamlessly intergrated CG Giant to the expressive and dynamic pen ink characters.
2147;I've created a website for the movie with lots of articles, interviews pictures.
2148;This is a great movie to share with children and adults, and can be used to open a dialogue about violence, friendship, souls, death, identity, and most importantly.
2149;It's thrilling, funny and pulls on just the right heartstrings without being manipulative and condescending.
2150;And thank you.You'll love this movie!
2151;This movie is a beautiful piece of art(something Harry Connick Jr. s character would love to hear).
2152;I prefer to see hand.
2153;My whole family LOVES this movie.
2154;, laugh, smile, and look in awe.
2155;This is a classic and always will be, something Finding Nemo, Bugs Life, and Toy Story will not be!
2156;It deserves more than 5 stars, it deserves a million!
2157;Rarely does an animated movie appeal to anything but children, and rarely does any other studio besides Disney put out anything worth viewing.
2158;You can add all the humor and CGI effects in the world, but you can't fabricate heart.
2159;boy finds giant, giant turns out to be good, giant is misunderstood by everyone but boy, problem resolved in climatic hero sequence, everyone lives happily ever after.
2160;on of entire decades worth of history during the 87 minutes of this clever and engaging film.
2161;That's why it is incredible.
2162;It satisfies all ages but in an intelligent, classy manner.
2163;The boy, Hogarth Hughes, is instantly loveable for his wide.
2164;eyed enthusiasm, impish charm, and quick wit.
2165;Hogarth's mother (Jennifer Aniston) is an amazing addition to the movie because she offers a dose of reality that stereotypical cartoon moms do not have.
2166;even the villain in this movie is likeable (because great villains should be).
2167;"Calling Hogarth everything from ""Champ"" to ""Slugger"" in attempt to him win over into confessing his knowledge of the giant, Kent Mansley is the epitome of a charming, yet calculating numbskull."
2168;true cartoon love story, and it may not be an extravagant tale of adventure and magic.
2169;"What the ""Giant"" has is genuine, real, and is worth more than a thousand cookie."
2170;The army general, (John Mahoney), is a great supporting character.
2171;my daughter's loved this movie when they were young and now my grandson loves it maybe even more.
2172;Great movie with a wonderful message.
2173;My grandson and I watched this movie on TV and he wanted to watch it again so I ordered it so he could watch it when he wanted.
2174;Just a fun movie, great for kids and adults alike, insprirational message in love and trust that we can all learn from!
2175;Adults will enjoy this as much as children.
2176;It tells a great story about friendship and taking care.
2177;actually good values, nice conflict resolution situations, etc.
2178;My seven year old loved seeing it again after so many years.
2179;It is a film so expertly crafted that you frequently forgot that it was even animated.
2180;What they meant to say was come see a timely story about a bright young mind growing up in a world filled with cold war fear and pessimism who learns that hope for peace and the future comes from understanding those around you and making them understand the value of their own lives and that of those close to them as well.
2181;In this the Iron Giant was exceedingly successful.
2182;His adoption of the local beatnik as a surrogate big brother is perhaps the true connection story in this film.
2183;The characters here, as did each of us, must find hope for the future in their own, personal ways.
2184;All this is beautifully realized with animation clear, fluid and dynamic and a script that would have played just as well in live action.
2185;And while the film seemed to be frightening to smaller children, I still feel that is an important film for children to see.
2186;The final film provides laughs, tears and fears and more than being a film we would all WANT to see I believe that it is a film that we all NEED to see.
2187;Far from being just family entertainment, it is a film that completely engrosses the entire family.
2188;I also enjoyed the movie very much,i highly recommend this movie for family viewing,thumbs up for Don Bluth.
2189;All the moments are good ones, and Hogarth is a kid I can empathise with.
2190;The Giant has a few good lines, too.
2191;in weaponry, he also has a mind that can choose.
2192;Perhaps it sounds simplistic and shallow, perhaps because it is, but that moment of choice has huge meaning in my life.
2193;I really want kids to see it so that, when the question comes up, they know what it means.
2194;this is a light movie, but one worth seeing.
2195;A few of the visual gags are very clever, too.
2196;"It was difficult to return it
2197;IG has a powerful message about peace and friendship.
2198;The animation is great, too.
2199;Best of luck to Brad Bird with future releases.
2200;This is a superb animation movie.
2201;Compared with a animation movie from Disney or Dreamworks ( Prince of Egypt ) it is even as good and even better as some.
2202;The story of the movie is very good and will certainly be fascinating for young and old.
2203;And the animation is perfectly done also the effects in the film are very good.
2204;The voices are very good and fix perfect with the characters.
2205;By my opinion this is a instant classic that everyone has to see.
2206;By example it contains a """" Making of documentary"""" which is certainly worth a look."""
2207;All the extra features are also very well done.
2208;"terrestrial"" where also a young boy befriended an Alien like creature ""THE IRON GIANT"" is a heart warming story between a smart quick."
2209;notch Animation, beautifully painted backgrounds and stylish character model designs along with stunning Animation Effects, all masterfully put together to make this Gigantic Android and his Eathling friend the most unique and unusual couple you could ever encounter.
2210;A terrific Monumental experience you will always Remember
2211;it's all we deserved all along.
2212;This truly has to be one of the best animation movie of the 90s.
2213;the movie captures a beautiful story line, alpine setting from Maine and an animation that captures a detail which envies any animation movie made to date.
2214;I got this as a gift for my mom because she absolutely LOVES this movie(I do too) so i can't wait til Christmas, this is a great family movie
2215;iron Giant is a magnificently touching and non.
2216;This is one of our classic favorites.
2217;It has the classic Disney feel to it and is a fun story!
2218;The best kids movie ever made.
2219;My boys loved it and now my grandson loves it.
2220;I saw this for the first time nearly 15 years ago, and I remembered liking it more then than I do now, but it is still a fun show with which I can relate well.
2221;The director and voice actors are terrific and it clearly comes through in this film.
2222;There is definitely enough adult humor and political commentary to keep adults interested while kids will fall in love with the innovative storyline and clean animation.
2223;I would probably recommend this movie to anyone I would even watch a movie with.
2224;this is an incredible, intelligent and thought provoking film that transcends genre.
2225;The animation is top notch, with a seamless blend of computer images and traditional cell animation.
2226;There is a style to this film that I have not seen in an American animated film since Sleeping Beauty.
2227;The whole picture is a 50's pulp magazine cover come to life.
2228;Authentic period music supports the scenery.
2229;the story is entirely deserving of the elegant animation.
2230;as can be seen from the avalanch of customer reviews, this movie is REALLY good.
2231;It's definitely worth a place in anyone's movie collection.
2232;It's a beautifully animated work with a heart.
2233;felt story that has a great balance of drama and comedy.
2234;The characters are well thought out and multi.
2235;"I would recommend this movie to anyone
2236;It's a lot more than it seems.
2237;The Iron Giant was a fantastic movie.
2238;I cheered for the boy"
2239;4 year old loves it, I love it, dad loves it, toddler loves it.
2240;despite the fantasy premise, there is just something so incredibly genuine and heartwarming in this story that appeals to me, even after all these years since its release back in '99 and I was so happy when my 4.5.
2241;old liked it too, which goes to show this is an animated feature that can appeal to a broad range of ages.
2242;it's an evergreen classic that I believe will stand the test of time.
2243;a great adaption of the book.
2244;and a great movie in itself.
2245;Not since Disney's Beauty and the Beast has a film given a lot of heart.
