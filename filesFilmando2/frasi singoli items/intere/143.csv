3;The Great War has an affect on Salinas.
4;We see the carnival that entertained people in simpler times.
5;the ending seems incredible to me, however necessary to this particular story.
6;The novel must be much better than this film.
7;They could have done a much better job.
8;It was just as I remembered, fantastic movie.
9;Probably the best of the three pictures that Dean made.
10;and the second disc was very informative.
11;"It's a shame that James Dean died so young, he was a great actor, and ""East Of Eden"" is a good example of that."
12;"East Of Eden tells the story of a family in California, in the World War I period
13;So Cal starts a mission to win his father's love and comprehension, with disastrous results, that end up with a Cain and Abel kind of situation.
14;He is, of course, the soul of the movie, sometimes he seems like a young Marlon Brando.
15;But the rest of the cast is good and the movie is a classic.
16;The movie began halfway in after the Trasks moved off of their ranch, leaving out a huge amount of detail.
17;damn, life has definitely been tougher since the `fall'.
18;Read the book and see why we, even the best of us, are now all living just East of Eden.
19;i feel the James Dean movie to be superior to the newer one with Jane Seymour.
20;i bought two to give one as a Christmas gift to a young friend reading East of Eden for the first time.
21;This film gives an excellent look and insight into what a brilliant actor he was.
22;Watch this movie then movie is good
23;I have enjoyed East of Eden several times over a time span of some forty years"
24;no director has ever surpassed Kazan in capturing intense emotional confrontations between individuals, and the focus this requires is diluted and diminished by the widescreen format.
25;Restoring films shot in this colour format is quite a herculean achievement and they never equal the vibrancy of older films recorded in three step Technicolor.
26;east of Eden is still a terrific cinematic achievement, but it would have been more powerful still if it had been shot in black and white small screen.
27;winning director Elia Kazan, East of Eden was James Deans breakout big.
28;screen performance, one that will forever be remembered in Hollywood history.
29;The emotionally charged film tells the story of lonely youth Cal [James Dean], who vies for the affection of his hardened father [Raymond Massey] and favoured brother, Aron [Richard Davalos].
30;The film received four Academy Award nominations, and Jo Van Fleet won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Cals wayward mother.
31;going public this is one of the greatest of Kazan's accomplishments, who was at his absolute best with this masterpiece.
32;He helped to bring forth Dean's electrifying performance, which to this day still stand's as one of the best debut performances by an actor in a feature film.
33;Yet I find this story mesmerizing and profound.
34;Abra, who at first seems to dislike Cal, eventually grows to feel attracted to him.
35;This scene, set by the backdrop a beautiful field of golden flowers, is one of the most affecting and profound of the film.
36;Jo Van Fleet won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
37;the conclusion of the film is one that unfolds with brilliant pacing and some of Elia Kazan's most impressive framing of the characters.
38;east of Eden is a genuine American classic.
39;When you think of films with great performances this is a film that easily comes to mind.
40;Dean is so fantastic and so unafraid to be emotionally resonant, that it's shocking to recognize it as a film debut.
41;The supporting performance are so powerful as well, especially the supporting part by Julie Harris, which is so distinct when it's compared to her other performances.
42;it's one of the first films that was influential on my growing love of cinema and the power of filmmaking.
43;It is a fine work of accomplished art that is worth cherishing and remembering for all of its immense worth and contribution towards the craft of filmmaking.
44;It is truly an amazing tour.
45;The scope ratio effectively helps Kazan create a larger sense of the 'mood' in many of the scenes, especially when he makes things topsy.
46;the CinemaScope format preserves the film as accurately as possible.
47;This is one of the first films to use the widescreen technology of the time and in that regard it should be considered a pioneering effort.
48;This is not a fault of Warner Bros or the restoration team at MPI, but it's nonetheless something that has an impact on the visual finesse of the presentation.
49;This minor drawback aside, East of Eden looks stellar in an authentic and well.
50;ray transfer which dramatically demonstrates the importance of film restoration and 4K scanning when preserving films.
51;The way the sound materials were utilized in this moment (and to a lesser degree some other parts of the film) made it a slightly less enveloping experience.
52;I found it a bit distracting to my viewing.
53;The music score by Leonard Rosenman sounds beautiful and very haunting when it needs to be but also uplifting when the story and performances are in need of some emotional grace.
54;His primary contribution in the commentary is an evaluation of the performances and direction.
55;It includes informative interviews with Steinbeck's son, Thomas, and Susan Schillinglaw of the Center for Steinbeck Studies, as well as Schickel, Kazan, Harris and others (many via archive footage).
56;Its a decent titbit, though its too bad we dont see some of the other existing screen tests as well.
57;Nothing revealing appears in the party scenes, but the chat between Cal and Aron works well.
58;The cinematography and the colours look tremendous in the presentation MPI have created in restoring the film.
59;James Dean is fantastic in this first big.
60;"What is also odd is how director Kazan created such a sensitive and compassionate movie with incredible depth of understanding when he regarded both James Dean and main character Cal as ""self."
61;But then nothing about the phenomena surrounding James Dean makes sense, and so the underlying irony of this film, and the obvious tensions it brought to the production that enhanced the emotions onscreen, is perhaps to be merited.
62;dean's first, and greatest, big screen outing is a masterpiece of intrigue, emotion and style, in which our heart breaks as often as the chief protagaonist's, misunderstood, unloved Cal.
63;realised element that is as powerful as it is heart.
64;Dean plays the archetypal rebel with much more soul than he would later bring to the role of Jim Stark, and our empathy with the character as he tries to win his father's affections despite knowing he is bad is what makes this movie so remarkable.
65;With Cal we feel the hope and expectation, the suspense and anxiety, and with him we feel the hurt and confusion as good.
66;natured brother Aron steals his father's love time and time again.
67;It is perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of any Classical Hollywood film, and most certainly Dean's finest moment in his unfortunately short career.
68;reaching novel, but it is a tight, concise and infinitely moving adaptation.
69;"Dean's portrayal aside, the acting all round is incredibly strong
70;Added to this, an emotive score, an involving story, high.
71;This is my favorite James Dean movie.
72;It was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it.
73;Effortlessly cool, the essence of counterculture, beautiful, attractive to both sexes, and a phenomenal actor, James Dean had a long and lustrous career ahead of him, but tragically left us only three films.
74;But they are three brilliant films.
75;though East of Eden is less than the sum of it's parts, though it would lose half it's power if the brilliant Dean did not act in it, it is a classic among film because of the figure that strides it like a colossus: James Byron Dean.
76;His stage presence, his emotion, his tough exterior but complex mind mark him as one of cinema's truly great actors.
77;And East of Eden, directed by the incomparable Elia Kazan (On the Waterfront) is truly amazing classic of a film.
78;This film is a modern retelling of the Biblical tale of Cain and Abel.
79;Two brothers, one good and one bad, vie for the love of their father.
80;old story of sibling rivalry achieves new dimension through the brilliant direction of Elia Kazan who intended the evil brother to the more appealing one.
81;Dean's anithero is indeed appealing, in scene after scene of his amazing big screen debut.
82;wrenching pleas for love, his emotional performance as the black sheep of the family makes it clear why James Dean will forever be America's legendary rebellious teen.
83;The rest of the cast is exceptional: Raymond Massey as the father, Julie Harris as the ideal girl who loves both brothers, Richard Davolos as the good brother, Burl Ives as the family friend, and Jo Van Fleet in her brief but Academy.
84;winning performance as the mother.
85;james Dean was great along with the other actors.
86;I liked the acting and the production values.
87;What a wacky, unlikely family.
88;John Steinbeck's moving novel (last section) of the Cain and Abel story brought dramatically to the screen.
89;It was also James Dean's (as Cal) debut on film, and as this misunderstood and tormented youth he captured a lot of attention, with much comparison being made to Marlon Brando .
90;though Brando mined this field with much more bravura, mesmerism, and talent.
91;spouting father, full of what's right but incapable of showing love or compassion, and Richard Davalos is Aaron, who takes after his father.
92;Dean, of course, is the actor who made the biggest sensation here, but Davalos is also excellent and Jo Van Fleet took an Oscar in her role as the mother, Kate.
93;An excellent production, and a great job by director Kazan.
94;sometimes it's just best to leave a book alone.
95;A classical piece of cinema by Mr Elia Kazan.
96;I have to say this is his greatest work.
97;I had read the book many years ago, and loved it.
98;An astonishing example of literary cinema reaching the greatness of the original text.
99;The script is written to perfection, absolutely matching with the atmosphere of the moment.
100;loved the movie what great memories looking for other old ones like that Such a good bad boy!!!!!
101;love it, the classics are the best.
102;Film started off fine during the overture.
103;ray to watch the way it was ment to be seen.
104;I was going to order this one from the U. s., but discovered it in a local shop here in Sydney.
105;dean is great,maybe overly so.
106;it is a worthy project to introduce Dean.
107;I watched the movie with my sister the first night I got it in the mail and it is now one of her favorite movies.
108;I love that it is the Special Edition because now I can learn a lot about James Dean and East of Eden.
109;Wow, what an impressive screen debut for a 24.
110;the most impressive person connected to this movie, however, was director Elia Kazan who not only excelled directing this film but .
111;Now, that's not a bad year of work!Overall, it's a solid drama with complex characters who make you reflect about them long after you view this.
112;This film is an excellent learning tool for any modern.
113;uS History class learning about America's involvement in World War I.
114;german riot are so spot on.
115;One of the best lines is during the parade when Cal says to Aaron: """"Your own Wodrow Wilson's gonna' make the world safe for democracy."""""""
116;It is chillingly stark, shocking, and brutal at times.
117;"In addition to its other qualities, the movie is authentic
118;The performances of all its actors make this more than an interesting film and unlike Steinbeck's other great novels making their way to the big screen, James Dean and the cast tell their own version and interpretation of a classic.
119;John Steinbeck could take pride in this film yet feeling a bit short of its true value.
120;This was a gift to myself and was pleased.
121;It was almost like brand new and played great.
122;I'm very pleased with the company that I bought it from.
123;I really liked this film b/c of Dean's performance, watching him move and range of physicality to interpret his wild nature was fascinating.
124;surprised we got a lesson on the basics of vehicle down to the crankshaft!
125;but this works out unexpectedly quite well for Abra, if u like caring for someone who doesn't blink.
126;and using a COAL SHUTE to convey fresh produce, major YUK!
127;high recommend for Dean devotees, brother love, and how to really succeed in business!
128;that's James Dean at his quirky best in East of Eden .
129;Here he's in a dynamic face.
130;Massey seems genuinely perplexed by the eccentric Dean whose off.
131;Fortunately, this combination deepens the movie's core, resulting in an uncommon emotional powerhouse, driven by Dean's intense expressive yearning.
132;Often overlooked but contributing greatly .
133;Leonard Rosenman's fine dramatic score, alternately lyrical then jarring in the manner of the movie itself, and Jo Van Fleet's commanding turn, her scenes the only ones Kazan's camera does not allow Dean to dominate.
134;Despite the latter, it's an intensity that endures.
135;A must see for James Dean fans.
136;He really is Cal Trask, so moving.
137;I happened to read a few JD books and of course wanted to see his performances and watching it now in 2013 it's very entertaining.
138;East of Eden is a movie I always wanted to see.
139;The movie is great, but the special edition disc is even better.
140;It tells about the man, his passions and his life growing up.
141;My niece is absolutely infatuated with Jimmy Dean.
142;this is one of his earlier movies so I bought it for her.
143;EAST OF EDEN is truly, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.
144;this is filmmaking at its height, acting at its greatest, and writing at its most subtly exceptional.
145;time favorite novels, and so I approached this movie with the fear it could not live up to my expectations.
146;Nevertheless, some great reviews and a stellar cast gave me hope.
147;righteousness, and he lets this bitterness harm his relationships with his brother and his brother's girlfriend.
148;the acting is superb, although some of the music and drama feel a bit overdone by today's standards.
149;And the woman who plays Kate, Cal's mother, does well in her role.
150;These performances make it an interesting film, but they cannot overcome the liberties it takes with its source material.
151;hour spectacle to capture even half of its depth and content, but it seems odd that some of the most effective elements Steinbeck delivered.
152;adam's early and latter confrontations with his wife"
153;It is sliced Steinbeck at best.
154;James Dean's performance is one of the best I've seen.
155;Every actor should watch his performance in the film.
156;His performance with Julie Harris was great.
157;Elia Kazan had a great vision as a director.
158;This is in my view Dean's best film.
159;it's so hard to find this version of the movie, but thankfully i found it here!
160;This is James Dean's first big picture.
161;Definitely a classic, directed by Kazan who essentially gave James Dean his first big break, taking a chance on him.
162;The girl, Julie Harris, for some reason gets top billing here.
163;But James Dean obviously makes this film work.
164;I have been waiting ten years to see this film, and finally we can see it the way it was meant to be experienced.
165;"although as ingenius as he was in ""Rebel"" and ""Giant"", here we really get the chance to experience a more in."
166;"He does everything he possibly can to prove to his family and himself that he is unconditionally human
167;the rest of the cast is brilliant, Julie Harris to name names.
168;I don't know what it is about this movie, but I simply can't take my eyes off the film for even one minute, and it is a true gift that we can now experience it the way it was truly meant to be envisioned.
169;See it now while you still have the chance.
170;With his performance Dean brings alive the character who is himself an allegory for Cain.
171;Julie Harris, Raymond Massey, and Jo Van Fleet all deliver good performances that play off Cal.
172;Overall this is a classic adaption of a classic author.
173;so that was authentic drama between them becuase you knew they were real brothers.
174;sam Bottoms played Aaron the good boy.
175;you torment your brother and so on.
176;This is a classic film that tells a compelling story about a rocky relationship between two brothers.
177;It is also an interesting look into thedevelopment of the produce industry in the Salinas Valley of California.
178;It is a modern tale of Kane and Abel.
179;while the film is certainly fantastic, probably its greatest claim to fame is that it was James Dean's first film.
180;It is rare, today, that we see a novice young actor (remember Dean was only 22 when this movie was made) secure a leading role in a high profile drama .
181;and then nail it so well that critics everywhere fell under his spell.
182;Prior to this film, Dean had only made a handful of commericials, television appearances, and one or two worthwhile theatrical roles.
183;While the acting often can seem over the top, no one has ever been able to capture the lightning in a bottle that Kazan did with his amazing cast in this truly classic film.
184;James Dean first Movie, EAST OF EDEN, is based on the book, i liked this movie because James Dean gives a really good profomance and its a good story.
185;this is one of my alltime favorite films!
186;that would be very interesting!This film is still very powerful today and the scenes that stand out the most for me are the scenes with the lovely Julie Harris.
187;julie was the perfect choice to play Abra and her innocence and tenderness toward Dean's character in the film really drove the film for me.
188;the chemistry between the two actors was amazing and I keep thinking if Dean had lived this could have been a great screen pairing!This film showcased the talents of a wonderful actor and influenced generations of actors to come.
189;dean was amazingly gifted and was fortunate to catch the eye of Elia Kazan who knew talent when he saw it.
190;what do you expect from James Dean the talented man cud do it all, and if he were still alive he'd be walking all over these hollywood's stars
191;This movie is absolutely wonderful!
192;I have found it to be very emotional and extremely well done.
193;James Dean is an instant favorite.
194;I will always enjoy this movie, it is a true classic.
195;NO DAMAGES, artwork is flawless and the picture is beautiful and stunning.
196;This film is a classic because of James Dean who is probably at his best here"
197;Elia Kazan is here the main culprit and should be brought to court.
198;But the greatest changes are with the characters.
199;The film even gives her some positive side since she lends the five thousand dollars Caleb needs to start his bean business with Will Hamilton and we don't even know what's the connection between the Trasks and the Hamiltons since it goes back to the first two thirds of the novel.
200;And Lee plays a central role in that twist in the fabric of the novel.
201;this film with a tremendous young actor who could have done a career if he had not been frustrated to the point of dying in a speeding car is unluckily a complete betrayal of the novel and the phenomenal message Steinbeck was levelling at our blind and vengeful society.
202;Although this may be the least known of Dean's three major films, I think this is by far his best performance and the one that most fully explores his talent.
203;Richard Davalos is Dean's brother, and he has his father's love and the love of a sensitive young girl played by Julie Harris.
204;The rest of the cast is also excellent, with Jo Van Fleet giving an edgy portrayal of the boys lost mother.
205;The struggle for approval and the feeling of not fitting in is one that we can all appreciate, and it is sensitively and dramatically presented.
206;The Steinbeck story is a classic, and in the hands of director Elia Kazan and his terrific cast, so is the movie.
207;generational saga have been omitted here, but the film, which parallels the biblical rivalry between brothers Cain and Able, is quite powerful when judged on its own merits, and not in comparison with its literary counterpart.
208;the movie is set in Salinas, California, during WWI.
209;james Dean, in his starring debut, gives a riveting performance as Caleb Trask.
210;The scenes which feature Dean and Jo Van Fleet are electrifying in intensity.
211;It deserves its title as a great American classic.
212;Well worth purchasing this classic.
213;The information dtata on the film very interesting.
214;Director Elia Kazan allowed his budding star to improvise with terrific results, especially in the tear filled breakdown scene, clinging to Massey's lapels.
215;This classic with James Dean actually covers the last 25% or so of the famous novel by John Steinbeck.
216;the stern father, the rebellious son, the good son and his perfect girlfriend, and locks them in a classic tale of sibling rivalry.
217;The wonderful character of Lee from the book is absent, as is the wonderful sense of the country these settlers tamed.
218;On its own, though, it's a fine film with a star cast.
219;Samuel, an influential character in the book is only mentioned by name.
220;while the movie has it's flaws, it also has it's positive points.
221;The scene where Cal and Aron fight, is one of the funniest and most enjoyable parts in the movie.
222;Landmark Elia Kazan's film features vibrant color and atmosphere, top.
223;flight performances and a dazzling screenplay adapted from the Steinbeck novel by Paul Osborn.

226;The themes of this movie still have relevance, so one can stay engaged in the plot while enjoying the performances.
227;in sum, this is worth any Dean fan's time.
228;Great drama and a must.
229;see for James Dean fans.
230;The acting in this movie is top.
231;Unforgettable movie, well adapted from a masterpiece novel.
232;I loved the novel East Of Eden and had high hopes for the movie which is like the last fourth of the book.
233;There were important elements to this story that were left out.
234;It is a million times better.
235;He finally gets that respect and love when his father is dying.
236;James Dean played to character well.
237;Truly one the the best dramatic movies ever made and wonderfully restored by Warner's.
238;Keep up the great work on your oldies.
239;This was hard for me to find, so I was delighted to order it.
240;It's a fine copy with worthwhile extras.
241;Great move to discuss after viewing.
242;James Dean and Julie Harris are totally extraordinary in this movie.
243;James Dean was superb, and the creative camera shooting was exquisite.
244;A bizarre and fascinating storyline held my interest to the end.
245;"I just finished reading the novel ""East of Eden"", so thought I'd watch the movie."
246;fest and so unlike Steinbeck's world view.
247;And it started at the end, leaving out most of the gorgeous story.
248;Beautiful film with one of film's best scores.
249;Excellent performances all around and a stunning ending.
250;This is one of the great films.
251;The drama is so stirring I have the most pained look on my face at the end of this film as I try not to cry before I inevitably do.
252;James Dean made three films and all were great but this one is the best.
253;He was truly a great actor and a great loss.
254;This disk contains not just a great print of the film but several terrific special features.
255;The commentary with Richard Schickel is absorbing enough to keep you glued to the television set for another two and half hours.
256;I highly recommend this product.
257;It is a great movie, great cast and stands the test of time.
258;This is one of my favorite movies.
259;They really don't make movies like they used to back in the day, and this is a fine example of that.
260;Plot aside, gorgeous James Dean aside, the cinematography ALONE is breathtaking.
261;The color pops, you can SEE that whoever coordinated the lighting and color schemes and clothing really put thought into it, to showcase every detail and let it POP.
262;I think that is why I love the older films so much more, we used to care more about the details.
263;Now a days it is all about the famous actor, the fight scenes, the intricate and interwoven plot.
264;It could be pinned down as a chick flick, but it can also simply stand as a life story.
265;The tale of two brothers, the good and the bad, the true simple things in life that in themselves are yet so intricate.
266;Yet, I was still gripped by the sheer beauty of the whole piece.
267;Beautiful, love it, I'd watch it again and again.
268;Have to thank amazon prime for offering it on free stream as well, hats off to you!
269;I've lately been reading great novels of the twentieth century and I'd just finished John Steinbeck's East of Eden.
270;Certainly Steinbeck's best, the novel expands on the Biblical story of Cain and Abel through three generations of a family, more true to the Biblical text than most preachers ever could be, and philosophically ahead of its time.
271;generational theme into a few months of a wayward teen's life.
272;I highly recommend the 1981 mini.
273;And, my favorite character, Sam Hamilton.
274;I loved how the way James Dean did his person very well in this movie.
275;Eli Kazan did a great job of directing it.
276;like his others he creates a character we all want to hate or love or appreciate and he does it in a fantastic way.
277;many movies from back in the 'golden age 'are considered classic cinema,but 'east of eden'is the real deal.
278;i remember in 1955 everybody had to see this movie,an it still 'holds up,,.
279;fantastic performances by james dean an Julie harris are just the beginning,but the blu/ray transfer is gorgeous,,.
280;the movie has aged beautifully.
281;because this film was, in my opinion, the most intense and most powerful of James Dean's short.
282;"Nothing is fair about the circumstances of the characters and a seemingly ""certain"" situation can change from day to day
283;Relying on what documentaries have informed us about Dean's own life, portraying a character who is constantly attempting to please his father must have brought Dean face to face with his own demons.
284;which he was able to utilize to his advantage and for our enjoyment.
285;This movie is definitely one of the best!
286;James Dean's best role I thought.
287;He is powerful and commanding.
288;And it is set in my part of the world.
289;one seems to undertake a new production of this brilliant story.
290;Disc Two offers some fun bonus features, such as wardrobe tests, a fan.
291;friendly documentary and some newsreel footage (yes, that is CABARET's Joel Grey.
292;the movie itself is wonderful.
293;Great performances all the way around and you will barely notice the Fifties styles thrust into 1917 California.
294;the story, the acting, the cinemtagrophy are all wayyyy too rich and sumptuous.
295;excellent collection for film buffs and, especially, James Dean admirers.
296;East of Eden is a wonderful adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel.
297;Elia Kazan directs a visually and emotionally moving piece of cinema with the help of performances from James Dean, Julie Harris, Jo Van Fleet, and Raymond Massey.
298;the extra features on the second disc are wonderful, including a long deleted scene with the brothers Kal (James Dean) and A. aron (Richard Davalos) talking together in their bedroom.
299;the other features include a well written documentary on """"East of Eden"""" with interviews from Elia Kazan, Julie Harris, film historians, and Steinbeck's own son."""
300;Tragic story and tragic real life .
301;so many future great actors who met a tragic end.
302;the extra features were very interesting and well done.
303;It is my wife's favorite movie, and she thinks of it as a modern day form of Romeo and Juliet.
304;Movie will break your heart.
305;Julie Harris is wonderful, Raymond Massey excellent, and James Dean perfect which is why your heart will be broken.
306;Makes you remember this great talent did so little before his death and gives us a short legacy on film.
307;The Bottom Line:This adaptation of the second half of Steinbeck's epic novel isn't a great piece of storytelling but it succeeds in being interesting because setting the method acting James Dean against old.
308;school Raymond Massey (who genuinely disliked the young Dean) electrifies their scenes together, generating enough tension to keep the viewer engaged despite the less impressive secondary players and plot.3/4
309;Since the majority of viewers meet these criteria it is easy to see why the film finds a new audience with each generation.
310;And it is easy to understand the tears that are often shed by both first.
311;Which is why the film was so timely and contemporary when it was released.
312;"originally I ranked it a distant third in the James Dean film pecking order but over the years it has somehow passed ""Giant"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" IMHO, and I now find it to be clearly his best and more enduring work."
313;It is a real actors/director's film, with just six significant characters and with especially good performances from Dean and from Julie Harris.
314;She struggles sometimes with reining in her sophistication but that could just be the subjective perception of this viewer.
315;here are some random points to appreciate in this great film:Don't misinterpret Cal's (Dean) motivation, he is not doing things to win his father's love but because he loves his father (communicated by the early scene where he watches his father working in the kitchen).
316;Aron represents everything she understands that she should be and Cal represents everything she has been denying herself.
317;"it is really a coming of age story for both of them, with Abra slowly embracing new areas of human experience and Cal moving from adolescence to manhood
318;kilter nature of this family's dynamic.
319;screen friction between Dean and Massey"
320;watch for the stunning sequence late in the film when Cal slowly moves out from under the tree branches (his menace reinforced nicely by the score).
321;loved the movie, enjoyed it and it arrived as described and have seen it several times.
322;the picture and sound is outstanding.
323;James Dean has become a legend, both because of his amazing talent and the fact that he died so young.
324;He, Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando all appeared at the same time, with the same soul searing magic.
325;Of course we don't know, but fortunately we have these records of the few films he made, to enjoy.
326;Add the wonderful actors, (besides Dean,) Julie Harris, Raymond Massey and Jo Van Fleet.
327;and how can you miss?The story is deep and universal with fundamental human problems.
328;"We see the ""good"" man, Adam, who has ideals and standards, who wants to make a contribution for the next generation, who sincerely tries to do what he believes is right, but who has no idea that his very ""goodness"" is crushing the life of his son, Cal, just as he crushed the life of his former wife."
329;We were on the brink of the 60's in which all hell broke loose and a whole new generation of young people would rise up and re.
330;He embodied the spirit that was ready to burst out.
331;"Dean's talent, good looks and charm dressed this new rebellious spirit in a very attractive package
332;He gives us a fully formed, deeply felt and emotionally satisfying film that should please every sentient being on the planet.
333;It was a perfect film for that time, and, come to think of it, a pretty good film for now!
334;East of Eden by John Steinbeck is without a doubt a dramatic and suspenseful novel, with many themes evident and presented by the handful of characters introduced throughout the entire story.
335;Kazan produces his own perspective on the novel, and, from my opinion, does an adequate job, ranking possibly a 6.
336;the film begins with Cathy, the wicked, cold woman of the novel, wandering around, and eventually being spotted by young Cal, her son.
337;The viewer is able to enjoy the movie, (hopefully) catching on to the story and hints of the past, which earns Kazam major points.
338;One thing that can make or break a movie spin.
339;Kazam's tweaks in the novel change many things creating an interesting new flow in the story for non.
340;overall, the movie does include the main plot, and some important main events of the esteemed novel, and provides many dramatic and entertaining screen action.
341;This film is absolutely amazing.
342;All the performances were so incredibly well done.
343;Elia Kazan directed this with a great sense of trust in his actors (especially Dean), allowing them to delve deeply into character.
344;If you don't know anything about James Dean, this is the film that got him famous.
345;Yes, Rebel Without A Cause is the most popular, though East of Eden was his breakthrough performance.
346;If I had to rate Dean's three major pictures: East of Eden would probably be the best in terms of directing and acting.
347;Rebel Without a Cause would likely be his most popular and iconic, and Giant would be his greatest performance out of the three films.
348;Colors are vivid, there's a nice clean picture all around, and the overall remastering seems like it's been released with great care.
349;Dean's emotionally driven acting style (this was, of course, made during the height of the Method acting years) is truly refreshing to behold, even during screen tests of films made several decades ago.
350;Many actors today still hold Dean as inspiration.
351;Also, the box art/cover art is designed so beautifully for all three films.
352;I thought the entire cast were great.
353;The screen tests from the bonus features were really cool to see.
354;my favorite role however of James Dean is from the film Giant.you should check that out too.
355;Superb acting and adaptation from the Book.
356;It is a pleasure to have this as part of my library of greal films.
357;In this case, the 2nd disc actually has stuff that is interesting, regarding casting, background info and wonderful commentaries from some remaining cast members (mostly Julie Harris) and Kazan himself.
358;The amazing debut of James Dean, of course, is the #1 reason to have this in your collection.
359;His performance is often improvised, much to Kazan's surprise and delight.
360;This is a true original.
361;As you already know, this film is based on the last third of Steinbeck's novel.
362;Jo Van Fleet, in her first film role, plays Kate with fierce conviction, with generous hints of her meanness.
363;The relationship that develops when Cal finally meets Kate is the catalyst of the first part of the film.
364;His ongoing alienation with his father pretty much covers the second half, some great improvisation and a bewildered Massey.
365;I'm sure it's subjective"
366;Massey was wonderful as the father who loved the one son and had no use for the other, which made Cal work harder for that affection.
367;The father/son alienation is very well established.
368;Richard Davalos was great as Aaron, and I'm not sure what happened to his career.
369;"kate's barmaid/servant
370;His integrity was challenged in Hollywood after that, but he stil received a nomination for this film.
371;His body of work is most certainly respectable and deserving of recognition, but many remembered and it was an embarrassing Academy moment.
372;This creates a great argument about when art should be separated from politics.
373;One interesting thing about James Dean, which was a """"Jeopardy!"""" question a few years ago."""
374;It's so beautifully photographed, and presented so well by Mr. Kazan.
375;Kazan mastered the new medium perfectly.
376;superb color and detail in lovingly restored set.
377;adam grows lettuce and has come up with an idea for refrigerating the product during its long trek by train,so as to keep it fresher until it reaches the markets.
378;after one attempt in particular gets him tossed out bodily,he returns and is finally able to walk along the road with her side by side.
379;the day arrives and the crop is packed with ice and shipped out on the train.
380;"cal wants the occasion just right and he presents his father with the grand surprise
381;aron,on seeing his father,laughingly puts his head through the glass window,as the train pulls out.
382;his father has a debilitating stroke right on the spot and is bedridden.
383;abra has a heart to heart with Adam beseeching him to ask for Cals help,as it will show him Adam needs/loves him.
384;this film sports a host of powerful performances.
385;jo Van fleet who played Cal's mother got the best supporting nod from the Academy for her performance.
386;chest father,Julie Harris is great as Arons girl,and eventually Cals, and of course Dean pulls in a solid performance as the second fiddle playing brother Cal,full of resentment and angst.
387;kudos also go to Burl Ives as the town sheriff in his small but good supporting role.
388;technically,the film print has been struck using the original film and sound elements,som it looks and sounds great.
389;extras include:commentary by film historian Richard Schickel,a 50th anniversary documentary on Dean,the documentary Forever James Dean,Screen Tests,deleted scenes,wardrobe,costume and production design film tests,the trailer and footage from the March/55 premiere of the film.
390;all in all this is a highly recommended film for not only Dean fans but for all students of the cinema.
391;the drama may appear to some as kind of melodramatic in this day and age,but make no mistake,these are solid performance almost to a man here.
392;a must have,and it's done up right!
393;His was a compelling presence in each of only three films and especially so in East of Eden in the role of Cal Trask.
394;Aron is """"the good son,"""" complete with a girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris) whom his father obviously adores."""
395;Over time, they develop mutual respect and affection.
396;the acting throughout the cast (with one exception) is outstanding.
397;Van Fleet received an Academy Award for best actress in a supporting role and Dean was also nominated for the award as best actor in a leading role.
398;Burl Ives and Albert Dekker are noteworthy in their supporting roles.
399;As for Massey, he does the best he can with the role of Adam Trask, recycling elements of his earlier portrayal of John Brown in Sante Fe Trail.
400;She gets followed by a stranger who turns out to be her lost son of days gone by.
401;They reunite, by his intrusion, and they get to know each other and she finds he has a dilemma.
402;"That get to know each other scene in her small ""office"" makes me a big believer in top notch acting that can leave one breathless, without technical effects."
403;It is a well filmed scene that leaves two pros to do what they do best.
404;Timeless piece of work that will live on forever in movie history.
405;His narrow focus provides little historical enlightenment to the film.
406;"East of Eden (""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" are certainly in this same category) was a powerful explosion of raw emotional purism on the screen rarely explored in earlier cinematic efforts."
407;An actor must be truthful to each moment of a scene.
408;James Dean's haunting outburst stands as a testament of the Acting Method's stylistic honesty.
409;It should be noted Kazan was thrilled with Dean's interpretation so please trust the director not the jaded critic.
410;I watched this film with a determination to like it.
411;James Dean's performance is fascinating, given the fact that he was only 22 at the time, in his first major role, which he nailed.
412;salinas area, which is is a wonderful, atmospheric part of the country.
413;some classics are overrated, this is one of them.
414;Watch it for James Dean's performance, but that is about it.
415;Natalie who wanted to be the girl liked by especially the gang of bullies soon turned to the true affection from Dean and Sal.
416;much has been written about Dean as an actor and what is certainly true is that when he is on screen, you can't take your eyes off him.
417;the scenes with Dean and Van Fleet are the highlight of the film and a treasure of American movie making.
418;Both actors are electric with Dean drawing from his inner uncertainty and fire and Van Fleet, the consumate professional, using all her skills and intelligence.
419;These scenes are wonderful to watch.
420;east of Eden, released in 1955, justly takes its place in a small list of fine American films, not just because of the great performances of James Dean and Jo Van Fleet, but also because it dramatizes timeless themes in a most convincing fashion.
421;Those viewers who love the film and like to read will almost certainly enjoy the novel on which the film is based.
422;"james Dean (Cal) absolutely carries the movie
423;Steinbeck gives a depth and understanding to his characters.
424;with the exception of the excellent James Dean.
425;Adam Trask is a religious man, a believer in all the good of the world as he sees it.
426;He believes his son Aron is a good person"
427;james Dean is amazing as Cal, by far the best part of the film.
428;He is misunderstood, quiet at times but rambunctious at others, blunt, wild, tortured, and absolutely gorgeous.
429;He's such an intriguing character and such an intriguing actor, it is hard to take note of anything else going on.
430;The story is unstructured like Dean/Cal is so although it could be boring with anyone else, it is very watchable.
431;She is Aron's girlfriend but is fascinated with Cal and finds herself in love with him instead.
432;She is great in the final scene.
433;east of Eden is a good film, thanks largely to the legendary James Dean.
434;It is hard to find any movies in the modern age that are as well acted as this one.
435;James Dean obviously used Method Acting to create one the best performances ever seen on film.
436;Although the movie is only a loose adaptation of John Steinbeck's masterpiece, it captures the spirit of the novel.
437;The scenes between James Dean and Jo Van Fleet, who plays his estranged mother, are especially good.
438;It is impossible not to me moved by the son's desperate attempts to win the love of his father, who favors his fraternal twin brother.
439;This is an excellent study on the dynamics of a troubled family.
440;I soon found out: he was so unbelievably natural in his acting technique that the audience is captivated by his brilliance.
441;This was Dean's film debut and he burst like a thunderclap in the public's ears, not to mention staid Hollywood, which came to both fear and admire the handsome, rebellious youth.
442;Aron (Davalos, in another powerful debut) is the well.
443;Many people will feel empathy for BOTH brothers during this powerful scene: it shows us that Cal is, if anything, REAL while his brother is somewhat sheltered and idealistic in comparison.
444;The performances are all splendidly colourful and absorbing: Dean is unforgettable as Cal .
445;Julie Harris is fine as Abra (she succumbs to Cal's raw sexuality) and Jo Van Fleet is excellent as the tough yet essentially tender.
446;"hearted tubercular Kate who likes her boy Cal because he ""has sense"" as she believes she does."
447;Raymond Massey is fine as the puritanical father, Adam.
448;Burl Ives is memorable as Sam: he quotes the Biblical passage which includes the picture's title.
449;night sensation who acted with a unique naturalistic style and died a legend at the tender age of 24.
450;The movie is an excellent movie and portrays James Dean at his best.
451;Hollywood movie making at its finest!
452;The rumors prove to be true and he returns to Salinas with the secret.
453;hour bond is formed between the two men.
454;nominated performance is both amazing and amateurish at the same time.
455;Julie Harris is absolutely wonderful.
456;Van Fleet deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
457;The stories of how Kazan stoked the personal antagonism between Dean and Massey to augment their performances are legendary.
458;Burl Ives always plays a good part.
459;East of Eden was filmed in CinemaScope and Kazan created some remarkable wide.
460;He was nominated for Best Director and Paul Osborn's script was nominated for Best Screenplay.
461;east of Eden was extremely successful especially among teens who related to Cal's fractured relationship with his father.
462;It was the very first film to capture 1950's teen angst.
463;Also included are additional scenes, screen tests, wardrobe tests, and footage from the New York premier.
464;And it's the first time I've ever seen the screen test between Dean and Richard Davalos.
465;This is good, solid, revealing footage.
466;What a rare, precious gift that would have been to those of us who've only read about these rarefied treats.
467;This is the first film that James Dean starred in, and I consider it to be his best performance.
468;The entire cast is outstanding.
469;it is one of the greatest movies ever made.
470;This film will entrance you.
471;I think you will love it like I do.
472;page novel, has cast it with excellent stage actors then largely unknown to movie audiences, and has used the new (at the time) widescreen camera for the first time as a daring artistic tool.
473;"By no means are these the only reasons why ""East of Eden"" remains one of Kazan's greatest achievements and a classic of American cinema."
474;But they do help to explain why the picture endures today.
475;this is the movie that famously introduced James Dean in the finest of his three film performances, one that defined a generation and how youth is now depicted on screen.
476;His raw emotion and feral soul are unforgetable.
477;"winning role as his madam mother (Kazan was later to cast her in ""Wild River"")."
478;In other roles, Burl Ives, Richard Davalos, Lois Smith, Albert Dekker and Barbara Baxley make vivid impressions.
479;credits overture and haunting love theme, is still lovely.
480;He rates it very high but his remarks throughout often disparage the film.
481;Schickel, whose biography of Kazan has been published, wants it both ways.
482;based story is quite compelling, and all the actors make it worth watching.
483;some nice scenery of what is purported to be the Salinas and Monterey area.
484;Overall it achieves a blissful state of realism with its acting (Kazan's always had a way with actors) featuring multiple stand.
485;out performances, including a haunting Julie Harris and an Oscar.
486;"The story about the complexities of what is ""good"" and what is ""evil,"" based on John Steinbeck's novel of the same name, is classic, ringing true and even alluding to the Bible."
487;Dean brings something more unique, more youthful, and more innocent to his performance than Brando would have if he had been cast as planned till age became an issue.
488;"wise Dean is liberating, allowing a cinematic ""tough male"" persona to exude femininity and sensitivity, maintaining the character's independence without acting brutish or rebellious in a stereotypical sense."
489;One of three films the epic James Dean starred in, the films direction and and script from a Faulkner novel provides real viewer attention, your attention held as the book was one you couldn't lay down.
490;Nothing as good as the novel, too many significant moments and details left out, but if you enjoy James Dean films, it's worth watching.
491;The mivie is in fabulous condition.
492;delighted to have it!Best,Zena Wiener
