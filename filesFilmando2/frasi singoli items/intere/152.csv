6;It is uncanny, the physical resemblance.
7;And on top of that Jones perfectly captures the voice Gore Vidal described as sounding what a Brussels Sprout would sound like if it could talk.
8;He was as they say, born for part.
9;But as many have said, they serve as great companion pieces .
10;What a unique and interesting situation to have two very well made films done at about the same time and on the same fascinating subject.
11;and at least as well acted film.
12;'Capote' is an absorbing and fascinating ride through the life of Truman Capote.
13;It does draw a lot from the power of 'In Cold Blood' without being redundant to the classic movie chiller reinactment of a heinous heartland murder of an innocent family.
14;The film is focused, but it does retain the personal life of Capote.
15;it exposes the man's vulnerabilities as well as his duplicity.
16;The movie shows a man of compassion with some strong human frailties to boot.
17;nominated prowess by Katherine Keener).
18;The best scenes are when Capote interviews the killers.
19;The Capote story and the killer's story are well represented in this very fascinating movie biography.
20;Great movie, held my interest.
21;The plot unfolded well and the story line was deep.
22;On the one hand this was very hard to watch, Philip Seymour Hoffman was incredible as Capote, a great performance.
23;On the other hand it makes you all the more sadder he is gone, what a great actor.
24;growing up watching Capote on TV, Hoffman nailed this, amazing.
25;The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences may as well just serve up Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar now, for without a doubt, his performance in Capote is the finest of the year.
26;"But the film itself is absolutely mesmerizing, a beautiful, subtle, and beguiling tale, of love and art and journalism
27;He's now become part of the intellectual and artistic elite, a doyen of the salons and private parties of the Upper East Side and secure in his world and reputation as the New Yorker's best and brightest author.
28;Something about the gravity of the murders captivates him, and Capote decides the topic is perfect for The New Yorker magazine, an article in which he will show the effect of such a brutal murder on the inhabitants of a small town.
29;He must find out exactly what happened on that night in 1959, and he does such a good job of manipulating Perry's trust so that Perry believes he has a friend who will fight for his life.
30;director Bennett Miller, writer Dan Futterman, and most of all actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman capture this process with exquisite accuracy and with the smallest of flourishes.
31;The genius of the film, besides Hoffman's stunning performance, is that it knows exactly how much is enough.
32;the dialogue is intelligent"
33;capote is a stunning film, and a superb drama, as it mines one of man's darkest moral dilemmas .
34;that of gaining and using another's trust for mostly selfish motivations.
35;the supporting players are exceptional, particularly Keener as Harper Lee and also Bruce Greenwood as author, Jack Dunphy, who was also Capote's partner and lover.
36;Truman Capote was a complicated, competitive and totally driven man, a literary genius who had many demons, and Hoffman conveys all sides of him to perfection, letting you see the man behind the glasses, the effeminate voice, and the pouting often arrogant humor.
37;This was a very smartly made movie.
38;An egotist, that struggles with constant hints at homosexuality, as well as an insane genius.
39;"the basic plot of of the movie is that after great success from his novel ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" he is onto his next great venture."
40;In doing so, he creates one of the greatest non.
41;"fiction novels to date, ""In Cold Blood."""
42;This movie uses great characterization and you really begin to understand what motivates each character in the story.
43;I found this movie very enjoyable, and Hoffman's best acted film to date.
44;for those who saw many of the other Oscar nominated movies like Munich, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain, I feel it is time for you to also give this movie a shot.
45;Even the special features and commentary on the extras are great.
46;This is definately worth purchasing, or at least seeing.
47;The book is incredible and this movie is a great look at the development of Capote's seminal work
48;Someone that talked like the actors would really enjoy the movie.
49;It is in a 1959 setting which is the best part of the movie.
50;winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is an ok film that surrounds a true life story.
51;His book, In Cold Blood made Capote a legend but it also ended his career as a gifted writer, he felt such tremendous guilt about the way he manipulated one of the killers, Perry Smith.
52;But Hoffman's performance is truly captivating, his performance alone is a reason to watch Capote.
53;The movie, Capote, would then then make more sense and certainly be more meaningful, at least that's the way it was for me.
54;He had it all as an actor!
55;Retelling of Capote's life around In Cold Blood was truthful and honest in showing Capote's ability to use his subjects for his own gain.
56;I enjoyed the movie, great acting by all actors.
57;CAPOTE is an exceptional, somewhat complex, mature film that engages and satiates the viewer on so many levels.
58;the acting here is simply superb.
59;I'm going to lay claim that Hoffman's effort as the lead character is one of the very finest (Top 10 worthy) performances that I have ever witnessed.
60;The awards he garnished are so well.
61;And Catherine Keener's subtle yet strong portrayal as Harper Lee is flawless, as is the rest of the cast.
62;the film itself is beautifully shot, and the script is likewise excellent.
63;Like 'Rob Roy' which flew under the radar due to the huge splash made by 'Braveheart', I'm hoping that 'Infamous' is another hidden gem.
64;in the meantime, I will admire 'Capote' for the great film that it is .
65;an easy 5 Star rating here.
66;I enjoy true stories and/or biographies.
67;This was a great story and very well acted.
68;Reality that showed the true complexity of life's situations.
69;In my opinion, the best actor for that role would have been Peter Lorre.
70;Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the title role and this showcases his genius.
71;He captured another genius, Capote, and tells the story about one phase in Capote's life.
72;If you did not see this movie the first time around you are in for a real treat.
73;The story goes into Capote's personality and how tenacious he was in the research of his best selling book, In Cold Blood.
74;This movie contained some of the best acting I have seen.
75;I thought the portrayal of Capote was exceptionally true to thereal life character.
76;In doing so, it is able to carefully, and leisurely, develop a very nuanced and subtle psychological drama, a drama almost as chilling as the slaughter of four innocents in a desolate Kansas farmhouse.
77;Under the best of circumstances this process occurs in good faith, with respect for the subjects and their dignity.
78;Capote makes his deal with the devil and gets his reward, heightened celebrity and a fabulously successful book.
79;many wonderful performances in this picture.
80;Catherine Keener's Harper Lee is equally on point, while Bob Balaban is perfectly cast as New Yorker Editor William Shawn.
81;Warning: This review contains a lot of background and contexting!CAPOTE the movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman is an excellent movie with excellent precedents.
82;acclaimed film version was released starring Robert Forsythe as the investigator and Robert Blake as Perry Smith the half.
83;"After IN COLD BLOOD the blockbuster ""nonfiction novel"" and IN COLD BLOOD the movie, in the eighties came biographer Gerald Clarke's excellent and accessible biography CAPOTE, and it is from the middle third of his book that CAPOTE the movie is largely taken."
84;As a young adult Capote's writings were symbolist and somewhat ethereal, epitomized by his first full.
85;But even the young Capote, anticipating middle.
86;Our movie here does a sublime job of allowing how that character was created.
87;for the killers to be executed before the book could be released to a grateful American public in 1966.
88;there was another Capote besides the merry prankster and wit.
89;"IN COLD BLOOD the ""nonfiction novel"" could draw on considerable dramatic irony in detailing the world the four Clutter family members were forced to depart."

94;Also in accord with Clarke's biography, the film makes it clear that Capote was extremely sympathetic to Dick and Perry .
95;it is effective and Hoffman's performance is nothing short of extraordinary.
96;"I can forgive the early glosses over the naturalism of IN COLD BLOOD's careful delineation of the Clutter family's life and character
97;down world of publishing no one knew whether to class the book as fiction or non, it is a tour de force and few people who read it come away unmoved.
98;print works back into print (the reader may recall that this happened to Patricia Highsmith's *oeuvre* two years ago).
99;Worth going to some trouble to find in particular is THE MUSES ARE HEARD, a sympathetic but slightly prickly memoir of Capote's 1956 journey to Moscow with the American cast of """"Porgy and Bess"""" on a cultural exchange mission to the U. s. s. r. Like his other work it is sublimely written and this time sublimely funny too."""
100;Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers an amazing performance as Capote.
101;I don't know what Capote was like in real life but even if his impression of him was off, he's still powerful in this movie.
102;Worth a watch, on a very depressing, gloomy, rainy day.
103;but this story has great merit on its own, for it perfectly depicts the delicate, difficult (and in this case compromised) balance between a great writer's desperate urge to tell the truth and the strategy he must employ to obtain it.
104;The day after the murders, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) opens the New York Times, reads an account of the murders on the inside pages, carefully and neatly clips the article and calls his New Yorker editor, William Shawn, to say he will change course to write about the crime.
105;He shamelessly declares to his lover, friends and associates, including Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), that this story will let him create a new genre, the non.
106;Yet remarkably, he fulfills his promise, in a breathtakingly gruesome and insightful account (read by this viewer long ago), again today a bestseller.
107;For years, he doggedly reports, collecting every available document and interviewing everyone associated with the killers or their victims.
108;He also ingratiates himself with friends and families of victims and killers alike.
109;capote develops seemingly genuine sympathy for the imprisoned murderers.
110;But his kindness is ultimately self.
111;serving, for it also ensures that Smith won't die before telling Capote details of the murders.
112;fiction thriller, In Cold Blood.
113;"Smith continues talking to his ""amigo."
114;While repulsed by the evil deeds of Smith and Hickock, he finds and funds an attorney to appeal their case.
115;Capote can't precisely explain, he tells Harper Lee, his childhood Alabama friend, in his characteristically high, disconcerting voice.
116;It is as if Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front.
117;Yet Capote leverages his sympathy and personal experiences to gain his subjects' confidence.
118;The rate of this movie should be 6 stars or more .
119;Philip Seymour Hoffman does an awesome job in this movie.
120;I see why he won the Oscar for his portrayal of Capote.
121;I didn't even recognize Mr. Hoffman, he was sooo good!
122;I have long hoped to see more of him and in more challenging roles.
123;This is some of the best acting on film.
124;"The story is told so brilliantly that it is worthy of its' subject, the immortal author of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" and ""In Cold Blood,"" which is the period of his life the film focuses on."
125;Like a great novel, this film breathes .
126;It is full of subtlety.
127;He knew how to reach people.
128;He treated everyone as an individual and learned each person's personal language.
129;i hope to see more Hoffman after this, and in roles that are worthy of his sublime genius.
130;was funny, but so beneath a person of this stellar ability.
131;Terrific in the role and one of his best.
132;"The script, the direction, the supporting actors, the score, the cinematography
133;In fact, the best thing about this movie is the masterful direction from Bennett Miller (who should have won the Oscar in my opinion).
134;Mychael Danna's score is yet another masterful facet of the film"
135;Adam Kimmel beautifully constructs the films cinematography, creating an eerie vibe that permeates each and every scene.
136;`Capote' is the type of film I refer to as a `mood' film, for it relays a certain emotion so well you can't help but succumb to its advances.
137;His relationships are bare and open for the viewer, which helps shed a light on his somewhat ambiguous actions.
138;"His motives may not always appear clear, for he was a very subtle yet conniving man
139;Yes, Philip Seymour Hoffman was astonishing"
140;His performance gets better and better for me each and every time I watch the film.
141;There is a scene, probably my favorite scene in the film, where Capote visits the morgue.
142;His face, that stagnant expression as he lifts the mother's coffin lid and pears in at the body, is priceless.
143;"While I still feel that Heath Ledgers monumental achievement in `Brokeback Mountain' was superior work, I can't really complain about Hoffman's Oscar win
144;catherine Keener received a lot of attention for her subtle supporting role as Nelle Harper Lee.
145;It's a superb performance that sadly went underappreciated.
146;in closing I just want to say that `Capote' is a superbly crafted gem of a film"
147;"Miller is a marvelous director who captures the heart and soul of his subject
148;shocked with savage grief because we know those words to be true.
149;The entire film is haunting, chilling even, and the aftereffect is one that will stay with you long after the film has ended.
150;that's about the best summary of a movie I've read on amazon.
151;what's truly fascinating when watching 'Capote' is realizing that after 'In Cold Blood,' Capote *never* finished another piece of work.
152;director Miller, screenwriter Dan Futterman and biographer Gerald Clarke make clear that 'In Cold Blood' scarred Capote.
153;He literally sold his soul to mold and finish the book he wanted.
154;His is a truly mesmerizing performance.
155;all first rate and engrossing.
156;See why Hoffman won academy award!
157;This is a very interesting lens into several fascinating personalities.
158;Hoffman is, of course, brilliant.
159;I found it captivating"
160;And the voice and mannerisms, which I assume are true to form, made him a far more riveting character than the entourage of great acting around him.
161;His best performance in my opinion.
162;Movie was well acted by all.
163;clifton Collins is most convincing as condemned killer Perry Smith, who enters into a relationship with Capote under the strangest of circumstances: within the confines of a jail cell.
164;The filmmakers and cast do an admirable job of recreating a world that's one.
165;hoffman was always a compelling presence on the screen, always spellbinding and interesting.
166;His taste in roles was always impressive, and no matter how small the role, he never, ever cashed in, but gave it his best and acted with passion.
167;Hoffman gave us brilliant performance after brilliant performance, until we believed him utterly incapable of giving us a performance short of spellbinding.
168;For this to be his debut narrative film, Miller did a wonderful job.
169;He knew what pace and mood to set for the story.
170;I also love the script which didn't spell everything out for the audience.
171;"Perhaps if you like to look at movies on a ""deeper"" level than simple entertainment you might possibly find this movie interesting."
172;The only plus side of this was the fine acting of the character Truman Capote.
173;Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as usual.
174;all of whom are great.
175;A surprise, it was more than what I had expected.
176;A will made movie that I would definitely recommend.
177;Phillip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant in this role.
178;"Either way, the film was well presented and makes you want to read the book ""in cold blood"" somewhat."
179;The movie was well done and Hoffman's performance was excellent.
180;It's an intellectual telling of a true story.
181;He captures Truman Capote right down to the habitual mannerisms.
182;Though the story is grizzly and dark, it is real.
183;His writing won my heart with Breakfast at Tiffany's when I was a young girl.
184;Two amazing men coming together to produce a classic.
185;Both gone now but they will be remembered always for their incredible talent.
186;He is magnificent as Capote!
187;He was one of the really Great Actors of today and will be sadly missed!!
188;"He was finally honest in saying that he just wanted the ""real"" story."
189;He changed himself and blamed it on these events.
190;'Capote' gives us a candid look at a very brilliant mind.
191;He truly was a brilliant mind before his time.
192;it is a very good movie about a very memorable talented, but strange man.
193;And Mr. Hoffman did a magnificent job.
194;He had made so many movies and quite a good actor even thought some of his movies were strangeto me.
195;"I enjoyed this movie very much, but I would not recommend it to others without mentioning that the pace of the movie is ""controlled."""
196;To be sure, this film has a lot of quiet in it.
197;There are lots of long takes, reaction shots, and pauses.
198;existing interest level in the material.
199;Others who might enjoy it include folks who have read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, or subscribe to THE NEW YORKER, or don't mind a slowly.
200;told story with absolutely killer (no pun intended) acting.
201;This film taught me how this extraordinarily gifted writer's greatest success led to his ruin.
202;"It was fascinating to someone like me, who had only known the ""ruin,"" not the man."
203;Beautifully acted depiction of a poignant true story.
204;The movie captures the emotion of Capote's conflicting motives in a very human way.
205;Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Truman Capote in this film is amazing, but the film itself is just as interesting.
206;It shows him constantly at odds with himself, negotiating morally over how to deal with the real people involved in the crime.
207;For the book to be good, Capote knows that he has to get close to everyone involved.
208;Capote essentially drives himself mad trying to compromise being an impartial journalist and a sympathetic human being, but watching his descent is fascinating.
209;As he continues writing IN COLD BLOOD, the movie shows us a contrast to his struggle, the rise in fame of Capote's childhood friend Harper Lee, played sharply by Catherine Keener.
210;At times, the film is funny, uncompromisingly dark and always fascinating.
211;Philip Symour Hoffman is a good actor, and his performance in this movie is good, but not good enough to make it worthwhile.
212;murderers are captured, and there's a person with influence who befriends/falls in love/sympathizes with the killers, and mourns them when they are executed.
213;He brings with him his lifelong friend, Harper Lee, who served as his research assistant.
214;Once the movie begins, it is a challenge to pause.
215;Phillip Seymour Hoffman put forth tremendous effort to recreate on screen (and I think accurately) one of the most distinctive personalities of our time.
216;known and infectious and, most probably, completely fabricated.
217;Although it covers only a few year's time, this work tells us much about who the man really was.
218;Strong supporting cast and riveting storyline.
219;Perry, whose mother was a Cherokee Indian, grew up in an orphanage.
220;"People remember first impressions and ""be careful what you do to get what you want."
221;the dial telephones were a good touch as that is what we had back then.
222;Having grown up during the lifetime of Truman Capote and seeing some of his actual interviews on television many years ago, I found this movie to be compelling.
223;Some actors are born to play certain roles.
224;"moreso, since Capote had written ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" at an astonishingly precocious age, a title he pirated from a wealthy confidante who told him about a sexual encounter he'd had with a sailor, and the next morning Capote's friend said to his guest, ""Brunch is on me at the finest restaurant you can name"", and the seaman said, ""Well, let's have breakfast at Tiffany's!"""
225;nell, Harper Lee, would prove invaluable to Capote since she had an engaging ability to charm a rural community already on extreme edge since the incident, and was less shocking than Truman upon introduction.
226;"nell told a friend, ""Oh my God, this is the beginning of an intense love affair between Truman and Perry""."
227;"This film is a generally excellent piece of realism about writer Truman Capote and the making of his early 1960s ""non."
228;The performances, cinematography, design, pacing, and (for the most part) direction and editing cannot be faulted.
229;The book was successful in its own right and on its own merits.
230;It has indeed had an influence on American art and literature, some very good and some bad.
231;But the experimental nature of the project was bound to incur unknown personal and psychological costs and risks.
232;Thus for all its great aesthetic merits, which carry it far, this film is ultimately not satisfying as either an unbiased record or as a moral tale.
233;Performances, casting and filming were all top notch.
234;Clearly one of my top 5 favorite movies.
235;Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar and I'm glad he won.
236;"He is a true talent and shines way above other so called ""actors"" in today's movies."
237;He has a very bright future ahead of him if he keeps picking movies like this to do.
238;This is a very leisurely paced film, but rewarding for the patient and open.
239;Hoffman gives a deservedly Oscar winning performance.
240;Must be something really subtle about it that got past me.
241;the best part of this movie for me is that it got me interested in reading the book and seeing the movie 'In Cold Blood'.
242;The portrayal of Capote is well balanced, not romanticizing the author's often sneaky, calculating and even deceitful methods of extracting information from all the available sources.
243;The film also presents a good picture of how well.
244;connected the author was, the elite circles in which he moved and the qualities in him that made him so appealing.
245;capote gives good background information on the Clutter family murders , which inspired Capote to write his book.
246;The appeal of the film is more the glimpse it provides into how a creative individual goes about getting to the real stories behind sensationalized events.
247;I found this movie fascinating for its look at Capote himself and what went into writing the book.
248;`capote', the biopic of a few years in the life of novelist and short story writer, Truman Capote, directed by Bennett Miller, and starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman, for which he won the Best Actor Academy Award, is very much of an `insider's movie with strong influences from it's primary subject, Capote's `nonfiction novel', `In Cold Blood'.
249;for starters, the director and writer, Dan Futterman, take a very minimalist approach to their subject.
250;For a film about a writer, there seem to be remarkably few words spoken in the script.
251;In my experience, this is the only extra which is often worth troubling with, expecially in a movie with such a narrow focus.
252;Truman Capote's masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD (1965) set a new standard and style in the literary world.
253;forward to the 2005 film CAPOTE and we get the answer.
254;And this time, they not only got it right by casting Mr. Hoffman in the role of Truman Capote, they bottled a bit of magic and captured it on film.
255;His mannerisms, voice and costumes were impeccable.
256;Although intriguing and genuinely creepy, it held only a small piece of what Truman Capote was.
257;Ok, I know this movie has received tons of kudos, but I myself can't really for the life of me see why.
258;I'm a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, but egads!
259;Still, great performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
260;Great score, and the casting overall is excellent.
261;The acting in this movie was very well done.
262;While the movie was slow, it managed to keep my attention and I enjoyed it.
263;The screenplay is as gripping and exciting as a fictional mystery, yet it builds on the true account of how Truman Capote came to writeIn Cold Blood.
264;capote visits them in prison and helps obtain a lawyer for their appeal, but eventually becomes obsessed with Smith.
265;"He sees him as a vulnerable, sensitive and misunderstood man
266;to visually convey the brutality of the subject matter, a number of images are startlingly realistic, and stay with you long after the movie ends.
267;He assumes Capote's appearance and quirky demeanour, complete with raspy voice and mannerisms, with such convincing perfection.
268;It is little wonder he has garnered a host of accolades, including a Golden Globe and Oscar.
269;Hoffman gives the performance of his career portraying the eccentric and funny sounding Capote and Catherine Keener is excellent as Capote's best friend and fellow author Nelle Harper Lee, writer of """"To Kill a Mockingbird."""""""
270;While the performances are well done and convincing, the movie and the plot are never outstanding.
271;The drama, the alcohol, the falling in love.
272;Capote doesn't ever come off as more than a good drama that is well acted by very capable actors and while that may not please people hearing nothing but rave reviews about how amazing the movie is, it's worth it to see the actors stretch out and give their thoroughly convincing performances.
273;In between both he got a consideration to Perry Smith while his partner who is cold and very cocky is kind of an obsticle for himself.
274;Love Perry Smith character and I'm very surprised by the global movie.
275;Awesome job and a Oscar nominee.
276;"or ""a triumph"" because they were gay."
277;based on Gerald Clarke's biography of the famous writer, Dan Futterman's screenplay focuses in on Capote's late 50's.
278;early 60's period and the conflicted relationship he developed with killer Perry Edward Smith during his research for what would become his best.
279;philip Seymour Hoffman is phenomenal.
280;He's transformed into Capote, showing a coldly manipulating underside to the colorful writer who was world famous for his humorous socializing antics and talk show schmoozefests.
281;Taking on a legend, Mr. Hoffman gaves us a perfect performance, absorbed in the characteristics,absurdities and brilliance of Capote !
282;His Oscar was well deserved !
283;May he rest in peace,and thankfully he left behind this and many other first rate performances !
284;This is a must see !
285;I was quite interested in watching it again.
286;My opinion of Philip Seymour Hoffman winning the Oscar for this movie is probably controversial.
287;I felt at the time and still feel that Joaquin Phoenix should have won it for his performance as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line.
288;Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash was excellent.
289;Anyway, I was very interested in this movie and kept my interest.
290;I also liked learning more about Harper Lee after watching this movie.
291;Give the movie a watch, it is worth it.
292;If you read the book In Cold Blood you will find this movie very interesting.
293;I chose because all the acting was so good.
294;Hoffman was believable as Capote.
295;I viewed this film everal years ago on my son's BIG screen in his movie room.
296;As weird as PSH is, he played a great role in the film.
297;Better yet just do yourself a favor.
298;Nothing to see here move along now people!
299;If cappers really did sell his soul as they claim then he deserved the $2.33 he got for it in the first place.
300;Yuckadoo and blah blah 2!
301;Believe me when I tell you that this is one of the best films of the year.
302;It is a complex and multi.
303;He asks his childhood friend from Monroeville Alabama, Nelle Harper Lee, to act as his assistant and together they will explore the murder and its impact on the community for a magazine article.
304;Phillip Seymour Hoffman delivers the acting performance of the year playing the role of the cognitively unique Capote.
305;Catherine Keener was superb playing the solid strength of Harper Lee.
306;Yet Capote manipulates the two murderers and even pays for their first court appeal in order to obtain more information for the article that has now developed into a book.
307;Clifton Collins is excellent in the role of Perry Smith and Chris Cooper is excellent as the head of the Kansas division of the FBI.
308;capote had a rare gift, the ability to make himself totally vulnerable through painful self revelation, so as to obtain entry into soul of his target.
309;"capote names his book ""In Cold Blood"" but keeps this information from Perry Smith."
310;"one of the most wise plot devices in this film was to contrast the fall of Capote with the rise of Harper Lee and her wonderful novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird""."
311;Capote is a daring motion picture.
312;the film is an examination of the creative process, what it means to be a writer.
313;As a result, it is a more captivating thesis on writing than, say, Adaptation(not that Adaptation isn't good).
314;Despite all that, Truman Capote comes across as a likable character.
315;Flawed, without a doubt, but undeniably intriguing.
316;Few films explore this, but Hoffman's performance is a textbook example of complex acting, creating a multi.
317;Minor quibbles when the overall impact is so powerful.
318;It appeared that Capote was sympathetic to at least one of the killers, and yet he took advantage of them for his own personal reasons.
319;He lied to them, and he took himself away from them after he had seemingly built up a mutual friendship.
320;he brought this complicated man to life.
321;Interesting view into the life of Truman Capote and of his research and writing of In Cold Blood .
322;A gripping story well acted.
323;there is a very high price to pay for manipulation it would seem.
324;another great thing about this movie (besides Hoffman) was the cinematography .
325;A good look at small town Americana, and also the ritzy party.
326;up lush style of NY in the 1950's.
327;The supporting roles were good .
328;Harper Lee's actress does a very good job .
329;all in all, one of the best films I have seen in a very long time.
330;Without a doubt the best I have seen this year (2005).
331;I would love to see it win Best Picture, but doubt that it will due to its small distribution.
332;Capote is a rare thing: a beautifully shot film that subtly develops its characters through action and dialogue.
333;The story's okay, and the acting is good, of course, but those things are not nearly as compelling as the way this film develops the character of Truman Capote.
334;Give me a subtle movie like Capote over a drawn out life of a celebrity any day.
335;It's the way the movie develops Capote with this one event that continually moves me.
336;watching this one event unfold and witnessing how it effects the main character is truly fascinating.
337;First off, the acting in this film is top.
338;"pic, forget it, this is a romanticized account of famed American icon Capote and how his life was ""forever changed"" by the events that influenced his infamous novel, ""In Cold Blood."""
339;Great cinematography underlines the moody and stark themes contained within.
340;and the tragedy and humanity of it are only superficially hinted at so that the bottom line is that it just leaves one feeling, well, a bit inpatient (as Capote was) for it all to end.
341;if in fact the portrayal is accurate (we will never really know).
342;Wow, I learned a lot about Truman Capote.
343;Hoffman's portrayal of him was terrific, and the story in general was fascinating.
344;Its a good movie and I found it highly entertaining and Philip Seymour Hoffman did an excellent job as usual.
345;The movie hooks you in the beginning and keeps you entralled until the end.
346;I would recommend watching this movie.
347;And as the movie CAPOTE portrays, his venture into this true.
348;life Kansas Crime, may very well have been the very thing that eventually destroyed him.
349;philip Seymour Hoffman embodies Truman Capote in fine fashion and deserved the Oscar, without question.
350;He's a huge celebrity, movie star, life of the party and successful writer looking for his next story.
351;there's something incredibly deep, challenging and thought.
352;The movie showed a man who straddled the line of confidence and arrogance.
353;Philip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant in this role.
354;Sad story, but very well acted by the entire cast.
355;Learned a lot in this movie and PSH did a phenomenal job!
356;Great viewing and highly recommend.
357;The character portrayed by Hoffman was so realistic and intense.
358;In Cold Blood professional and personal meltdown cost him his very soul.
359;"In gaining the trust and help of the locals despite his ""flamboyancy,"" Capote also earns the same from his subjects, killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock."
360;But in getting what he needs from his subjects, Capote sacrifices both his professional and personal ethics and morals, and it is that which is the basis for this film, deservedly rated as one of 2005's best movies.
361;personal relationship with one of the killers (Smith).
362;Caught in his fallout is co. writer Harper Lee, Capote's quiet voice of conscience and logic, and actress Catherine Keener serves up an Oscar.
363;we also are led to conclude .
364;In portraying Capote, Hoffman superbly rises above mere mimicking of his subject and presents Capote as a complex and psychologically torn but self.
365;And this film is justly regarded as one of the best of 2005, and it and Hoffman's unsettling but masterful performance are must.
366;Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was subtle and brilliant as was the entire production of Capote.
367;Although Capote was portrayed as complex and very flawed, he was still likeable.
368;One line seemed to sum up much of the developing relationship between him and Perry, one of the killers.
369;All of the actors were excellent.
370;I've seen two Capote movies and I loved both of them.
371;If anyone gets a chance, see the other one also.
372;"I have the book, ""In Cold Blood"" and this movie about the story to write it was amazing."
373;His portrayal of Truman Capote is INDEED Oscar worthy.
374;I thoroughly enjoyed it and even learned a couple of facts I did not know before.
375;"For just a while, ""Capote"" is a book lover's dream."
376;"there's ""The New Yorker"" editor William Shawn
377;time director Bennett Miller has a real touch for capturing washed.
378;Collins (who looks a little like Robert Downey Jr. sharing the same face with Steve Buscemi) drifts swiftly between seeming sympathetic and shamelessly pragmatic"
379;but as good as all the other elements are, this is really Hoffman's show.
380;Phillip Seymore Hoffman did an excellent job of portraying Capote.
381;loved it and the Harper Lee association was insightful.
382;One of my favorite movies and always worth watching again and again.
383;Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives such a great performance.
384;capote is a major motion picture, in my view, with a great, mesmerizing performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote.
385;He captures the man's drive, his ambition, his empathy, his charm, his determination to get what he wants.
386;He is writing what he knows will be a great book, but it can have no ending until Perry finally breaks down and tells him what happened the night of the killings.
387;Capote lies to him, uses emotional blackmail, perhaps even believes himself some of the emotions he is displaying to Perry.
388;hoffman manages to evoke a reluctant admiration for Capote.
389;One can't help but admire Capote's talent and his single.
390;hoffman gives an extraordinary performance.
391;Also excellent are so many others in the cast, particularly Chris Cooper, Clifton Collins, Jr. and Catherine Keener.
392;If In Cold Blood is a book worth reading, Capote is a movie worth seeing.
393;I bought this to see if Hoffman really did capture the unusual personality of Truman Capote, and was not disappointed.
394;I remember seeing Capote when I was young, and in this film he lives again.
395;I always love a film based on real life events.
396;It kept my interest throughout the film.
397;I can see why PHS won an Oscar for his performance.
398;deserved Best Actor award for his turn as Truman Capote.
399;After years of stealing the show from other actors, in work as diverse and good as his roles in Boogie Nights, Punch Drunk Love, and Owning Mahowny (and he was the only reason to see dreck like Along Came Polly), he now has his statue.
400;He is excellent as Capote, who comes across as brilliant and charming, but also self.
401;He can't share in the joy of his lifelong friend.
402;"What made Capote a superstar, the ""non."
403;In the film, we see a writer obsessed.
404;Truman is in love with the doomed Perry Smith, but he wants even more to get, and tell, a great story.
405;Hoffman completely embodies his character.
406;But the supporting roles are well played, too.
407;One of last year's best movies.
408;Philip Seymour Hoffman was uncannily stunning in his mesmerizing Oscar worthy portrayal of celebrated author and personality Truman Capote, capturing all the nuances of his multi faceted personality.
409;Having seen Capote speak on many occasions Hoffman's speech patterns, mannerisms and appearance were eerily authentic.
410;capote gains the confidence of the accused killers Richard Hickcock played by Mark Pellegrino and especially Perry Smith played by Clifton Collins Jr.
411;At his best, Capote was one of last century's greatest wordsmiths.
412;his showmanship, sensationalism, and homosexuality.
413;Of course, what creative processes were behind Capote's creation of what he termed `a whole new form of writing'.
414;All the rest of it, including the direction by Bennett Miller, is superb, starting with Hoffman's stab at the icon.
415;Another excellent choice is to not do a cradle to grave biopic.
416;By focusing only on a few year period it allows us a look at a pivotal point in the character's life.
417;A final point, though, and that is with the title of the film.
418;hyped, but solid, performance, it is these little niggles and wrong turns that make so much of what the film does right go wrong enough to just miss being something truly great.
419;well written and masterfully portrayed, this movie literally takes you into the heart of Capote's life between 1959.1965 as he befriends two killers for are found guilty of murdering a farming family in Kansas.
420;this may not be the movie for everyone to own, but it is worth watching.
421;I can only provide you with my personal reactions and interpretations of this film.
422;The pictures it shows us are clean, spare, and give us time to look at and into what is going on.
423;In this movie, facial expressions matter a great deal.
424;Am I reading meaning into the performances?
425;But the movie gives me the opportunity to see and, well, luxuriate in thought about what is happening inside these people.
426;Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is so intelligent, so powerfully imaginative, and communicates so continually that I can almost not understand how he accomplished it.
427;Capote is an immensely complex character.
428;We see his public bravado and understand its balance with his private insecurities.
429;capote is completely able to tell a truth with a lie and then to lie with telling the truth.
430;Yet, Capote also knows that he needs to keep them alive long enough to extract their stories and get at the truth so he can write his book.
431;for me, the most amazing scenes in the film are Capote's private exchanges with Smith (and great credit has to be given to Clifton Collins, Jr for his contributions to these scenes).
432;Capote uses genuine emotion to charismatically pull in Smith.
433;"When you see his life after ""In Cold Blood"" one could make the argument that it did him in."
434;The entire cast of this movie is just wonderful.
435;Catherine Keener as Harper Lee is perfect as Capote's friend who knows him for what he really is and loves him anyway, but not to the point of self.
436;Bob Balaban is wonderful and knowing as, William Shawn, the legendary editor of the New Yorker.
437;Bruce Greenwood's sensitive portrayal of Capote's closest love, Jack Dunphy, allows us to see that as self.
438;the rest of the cast is also wonderful and I praise this movie without reservation.
439;This truly was a writing project that got out of hand, and perhaps, affected Capote for the rest of his life.
440;Not a happy film, but engrossing.
441;Capote accepts the verdict of death by hanging but also shows theterrible effects it has on those witnessing it.
442;The incredible performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman is what good movie makin is made of.
443;At times the movie slows a bit, but the story about the relationship that Copote develops between one of the murders that he befriends, just to research his charcter for his book IN COLD BLOOD is insightful and leaves the viewer asking for more.
444;Catherine Keener once again shines in another brillant performance as well.
445;Oscar caliber performances for both of the them.
446;Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved the best actor Oscar he won last spring for his performance in Capote, but Catherine Keener was equally impressive in her interpretation of Capote's long.
447;Capote, the film, might be found too deliberate in its pacing for all levels of patience, and it is certainly bleak, but it is an undertaking in which the performers, writers, and those at work behind the cameras coordinated well and got everything they set out to do exactly, I think, as they wanted it.
448;His Oscar is well deserved in this tour de force, nailing Truman Capote's mannerisms and motivations.
449;The Blu ray transfer is also wonderful.
450;Truman succeeded in a sense, for `In Cold Blood' made him one of, if not the most famous author in America, but it's not the book itself but the journey to completion that this film presents to us, and it does so masterfully.
451;what makes this film as effective as it is is its attention to detail.
452;First of all the entire film is shot in very subtle tones.
453;The opening scene, where a young girl finds the dead body of her best friend, is a perfect example of what I mean.
454;Not many films with this dark a subject attack a project like this with such candor and grace, but director Bennett Miller shows so much caution and delicacy with each approach that you swear he's mastered his talent.
455;Capote goes as far as to get the two men a new lawyer, one that can properly defend them.
456;This gesture is portrayed to mean one of two things, and the film helps you lean towards one, yet never letting go of the other.
457;Truman is painted as a very self.
458;love is shown is in the way he pays others to compliment him, as if to boost his own self.
459;confidence and make himself desirable to others.
460;"Her face, her eyes, her final words to him ""what did you think of the movie"" say everything."
461;the acting in this film, while yes it is what you may call impression acting, is superbly done, notably by Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who embodied the role of Truman Capote and delivered on every level.
462;His eyes do a lot of talking in this film, and to me, my favorite scene is another subtle yet powerful one, and one of the scenes I use to prove how powerful this film is in all its calm nature.
463;The scene where Truman visits the morgue to see the slain is especially prominent, for as he lifts the mothers coffin and looks at her body we can see his soul.
464;as a whole, this film is exceptionally executed, brilliantly acted, directed and scripted and is, not just a great movie but also an exceptional work of art.
465;I'd highly recommend the viewing of this docudrama for it opens the eyes and the mind and helps us all see what one man worked so hard for us to understand.
466;More tears are shed for answered prayers than unanswered ones and that is such a true statement!
467;He did a remarkable job acting out Truman Capote, voice and all.
468;the movie Doubt was excellent and in my opinion one of Hoffman's best.
469;Also enjoyed The Savages and Mission Impossible III.
470;The portrait of Capote that emerges is of a flamboyant artistic genius whose deeply complex personality reveals itself in decidedly mixed motives.
471;He attracts, repels and fascinates us, all at the same time.
472;Third, interviewing Smith evoked powerful memories of his own childhood that resulted in an obsessive act of self.
473;Capote won five Academy Award nominations.
474;Neither of us liked this movie.
475;it came brand new, still wrapped.
476;Oh, well, movies take a lot of license in toying with the plot at times.
477;Capote is the story of the writer's efforts to chronicle the saga of two killers who murder a prominent small.
478;"The tremendous fame and wealth from the resulting book ""In Cold Blood"" did little to offset the enormous emotional and psychological cost of writing it."
479;Capote is a serious study.
480;"definitely not a ""family film."""
481;Director Bennett Miller's brief but arresting images of the violence (murder, execution) prick the heart.
482;"Hoffman, who was one of the best things in the 1999 psychological thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (in which he portrayed a loyal, suspicious friend whose skepticism proves fatal) gives one of the most powerful performances in recent memory."
483;it's a masterful tribute to one of the most brilliantly tragic figures in American literary history.
484;Actually they all did a great job acting.
485;PSH and entire cast are terrific!
486;this film turned out to be everything I had expected with no real revelations and a tiring and mocking performance by the oscar winning lead.
487;"Actors break down into two groups for me
488;The first group, the excellent actors, bring us themselves , playing a role perfectly.
489;The second group is very much smaller.
490;It is composed of great actors who leave themselves behind and become a completely new character, leaving behind the actor and morphing 100% into the role.
491;phillip Seymour Hoffman, playing Capote, belongs in this second group"
492;This film is a must see because of his performance.
493;It is also beautiful filmed, wonderfully written, and intriguing.
494;Cast was fantastic and soundtrack was amazing.
495;He is depicted here as a manipulator and user.
496;This is a very well made little picture, supremely well.
497;acted by Hoffman, who has been growing year by year into a formidable actor.
498;"Just think of that awful little fat boy in ""Boogie Nights"" and consider how far he has come, giving here one of the great performances of the decade."
499;He is a brave, daring actor, fearless really, and willing to go where few of our handsome leading men are willing to venture.
500;on, eerily accurate and yet dynamically singular.
501;I enjoyed seeing some of the relationship between Capote and Harper Lee, also one of my favorite writers.
502;Phillip Seymour Hoffman does such a good job in this movie.
503;Philip Seymor Hoffman shows that his Oscar and Golden Globe winning performance as Truman Capote are deserved in what could be remembered as one of the best Performances in History, he is Backed up by a very strong performance in Catherine Keener playing Harper Lee, the infamous author of one of the most exeptional american novels of all time .
504;Wonderful Costumes, Exemplary Visuals and outstanding cinamotography.
505;To some people this movie might be a little bit slow but if you pay attention closly and have a decent attention spand than you will most likly enjoy and be amazed by just about every aspect of this Oscar nominated film.
506;Very interesting tale of the story behind the story.
507;An insightful behind the scenes peek at the man, the history, the development of the book, and the real life characters.
508;It is captivating from beginning to end.
509;I can see why Hoffman got the Oscar, but the other performances are very good too.
510;This is a very informative movie that has a very personal insight into the man that wrote one of the greatest books of our time.
511;It was an amazing insight into how much of himself Capote put into the research and personal lives of the killers.
512;He was compassionate enough to still see them as human.
513;He tried to treat them with respect to get his story and the facts he wanted, but got too close on a personal level.
514;This is a very well done movie if you want a closer look at one of the worst tragedies in our history, but brace yourself, it ain't pretty.
515;What a performance and story!
516;"In Cold Blood was a psychological study of the killers, ""Capote"" is a psycological study of thier biographer."
517;"frame recreation of ""In Cold Blood""'s closing scene.)"
518;If you can get past that (I guess I couldn't), there are excellent performances here (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's immersion into character is spooky good as always), but they are somewhat tempered by the film's deliberate, glacial pacing.
519;A weird man but a great movie about him.
520;"in the 2005 biopic, ""Capote,"" director Bennett Miller focuses on this process and its repercussions by concentrating on five years in the life of the charismatic and unconventional Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he germinates and brings to malevolent life a new genre of literature, the quintessential non."

524;Again, his gossipy social skills and his ability to reveal the darker aspects of his rather less than happy childhood allow him to burrow his idiosyncratic way into the homes and hearts of the town's inhabitants that will best help him appropriate the most exacting detail to fashion characters and circumstances for his thrilling and introspective account of the crime.
525;on a purely theatrical level, the film's players succeed in bringing an intensely complex psychological study to life without a moment's boredom.
526;"Amazingly, actor Hoffman visibly shrinks as Capote
527;That is until the real Capote seems to take possession like a spirit inhabiting a medium.
528;They exercise patience with Capote's genius and fully comprehend that the obsession that accompanies the hypo.

532;I think Truman Capote and Harper Lee are very interesting people.
533;The movie was quite true to lots of other information I have read about these too.
534;I thought the acting was excellent.
535;well acted movie, worth your time.
536;I am a big Capote fan and I think he did a truly great job portraying Truman Capote.
537;Capote was a master manipulator.
538;We were pleasantly surprised at this movie.
539;The acting was superb, and and the movie engaging.
540;Good storyline and great acting.
541;Amazing performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
542;Superb portrayal of a complicated personality.
543;Philip Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar and more!
544;This is an amazing movie, because we get to see what Truman Capote had to go through in order to bring his masterwork to life.
545;the actor, Hoffman, deserves all of the accolades he gets.
546;the acting in this film is phenomenal.
547;It is one of the best films of 2005 if not the best.
548;CAPOTE is without a doubt one of the best films of 2005.
549;do his outstanding performance in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.
550;Philip Seymour Hoffman was astounding as Truman Capote.
551;There are probably many actors who could have done as well, after all its easy to portray a 'real' person, especially someone who was in the public eye as much as Capote was.
552;He's been photographed and filmed so many times, all one has to do is study these films.
553;This scene just absolutely took my breath away, literally.
554;Great movie based on a true story and of course Phillip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding as the lead character.
555;It shows the relationship that Capote developed with the killers so that he could get his story.
556;Capote even became very close to one of the killers, and favored him over the other one.
557;He got involved in their case, even getting them lawyers.
558;philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Capote perfectly.
559;He deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.
560;another great actor in this is Chris Cooper, who plays the lead investigator.
561;He develops a friendship with Capote and lets him interview the killers.
562;catherine Keener deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Nelle Harper Lee, who is Capote's long time friend.
563;She assists him in his research and gives him emotional and professional support.
564;the one thing I enjoyed about this movie was that it was very realistic in its portrayal of life in 1959.
565;You really get a strong sense of the era as you watch the movie.
566;Director Bennett Miller really knows how to give the movie the feel for the times.
567;I've loved Capote's writings since the 60's and thought he was a most marvelous character.
568;i don't hand out 5 stars but this one deserves more than 5!
569;There was great distance between the two characters and the affection which according to product reviews was mutual was simply not there for me.
570;great acting)you're infor a treat into the human psyche.
571;An emotional outburst that is refreshing as compared to Capote's coolness.

573;maybe their last chance for a fresh start in the next world?The final scene as the scafflod trap door bangs make for a gruesome end to the tale.
574;I would describe the story as both haunting, somewhat bone.
575;capote's image is beautifully portrayed"
576;capote is real, uninhibited, at times sarcastic, but always human.
577;I was left very pleasantly pleased to have watched the movie, and highly recommend it.
578;This encapsulates Philip S. Hoffman's incredible talent and is a life achievement.
579;I would highly recommend this film!
580;Really enjoyed the movie, but Hoffman's acting was so incredible and very believable.
581;I really hope you'll watch this award winner.
582;He not only captures the externalities of Capote but provides a moving portrait of a man divided within by ambition and a self.
583;Neither can I tell whether it is a portrait consistent with the source materials upon which the script writers and Hoffman, himself, based their interpretations.
584;All I can say is that I accepted the portrait as a human being and a human being whose exterior actions seem consistent with the internal character meant to be portrayed.
585;"worth seeing, whatever may be ones views on capital punishment, whatever may be one's own conception of the truth of the ""confession"" and on who was using whom, or perhaps, you will find that each was seeking to manipulate the other and was himself being manipulated."
586;He is a well respected (yet full of himself) writer who becomes fascinated with two men who murder a Kansas farm family of four in cold blood.
587;The effeminate Capote is both entranced and attracted by one of the killers, and he is able to relate to the man's difficult childhood.
588;but Capote uses these men to sell a sensational story.
589;I give it 3 stars because the acting is superb, but the storyline is less than mesmerizing.
590;One of the best movies of 2005.
591;The insightful look at the character of the writer and the man, Capote.
592;"The two men have other parallels, as well: childhood histories abuse, neglect, and abandonment
593;It is honest and """"pulls no punches."""""""
594;an insightful demonstration of how children become violent.
595;Very skillfully done, thanks to actor Hoffman, especially.
596;In Cold Blood is one of the most fascinating works of American literature .
597;but the writing of the book is almost as fascinating as the events that inspired it, especially since the two became intertwined.
598;This forms the core of Capote, a fascinating look at the writing project that overwhelmed Truman Capote's life .
599;and while the movie is quite solid, it's the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who truly shines.
600;suddenly Capote is inspired to take his story far beyond its roots, and his New Yorker story begins to blossom into a full.
601;the late Philip Seymour Hoffman won an Academy Award for his performance as Truman Capote, and it isn't hard to see why.
602;his looks, his high nasal voice, his fey mannerisms .
603;but he also fills the cracks with lots of genuine emotion.
604;on one hand, Capote seems to feel a true connection to Perry, as if they are two sides of the same coin .
605;as a recounting of what happened, the film is actually pretty close to the reality of what happened .
606;the other actors are all pretty good, although they are effectively window dressing for Hoffman .
607;Catherine Keener is the only one who truly rises above the herd, depicting Lee as a sharp, smart, incisive woman whom Capote leans on.
608;Capote is one of those movies that is elevated to brilliance by the presence of a truly great actor .
609;and the director's delicate, nuanced touch with Capote's psyche doesn't hurt either.
610;I totally loved this movie.
611;It was so well made and the acting was second to none.
612;I am truly glad I got to see such an amazing cinematic work of art.

616;in this film, Hoffman does a phenomenal job on Truman Capote.
617;His face just flows so effortlessly from one emotion and mood to the next, expresses a combination of conflicting emotions perfectly.

626;"Actor Dan Futterman, familiar from his guest turns on ""Will and Grace"" and ""Sex in the City"", has written a delicately balanced screenplay that highlights the contradictory forces with which Capote was grappling in getting his story on paper."
627;although Miller's direction and Futterman's script are both strong for rookie efforts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances.
628;In a startling transformation, Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabits Capote from the most subtle mannerism to his inner soul.
629;Always a fine character actor, Hoffman brings his dead.
630;dropping in Kansas, there is no question in Hoffman's performance that Capote is a man in love with himself.

632;The prison cell scenes between Hoffman and Collins have an intriguing, disturbing charge that subconsciously seems to point to the homoerotic nature of their relationship.
633;Smaller roles are filled expertly .
634;I only wish there was a greater sense of a denouement to the film, but regardless, the film is certainly worth seeing for Hoffman's masterful performance.
635;he played the part better than anyone could.
636;He was unusual, interesting, talented, and even funny.
637;philip Seymoure Hoffman's acting was amazing.
638;I've always been a fan of his and this movie is his truly shining star in the galaxy of celluloid.
639;It took him years to finish the book due to the fact that Perry Smith, one of the convicted killers, wouldnt' tell Capote details about the crimes he committed.
640;"i think ""Capote"" is one of the best films to come out of 2005."
641;Everything about this movie was brilliant.
642;I highly recommend it to the movie fan who appreciates all genres of film.
643;Movie was excellent but the lighting was rather dark in a few scenes.
644;Would definitely recommend this movie.
645;the movie was very dark, but I enjoyed it, an in depth look at capote, and sad to say i think playing the part was on cause of the actors death
646;Hoffman gets the voice right.
647;Hoffman is one of the best actors out there right now.
648;I will definitely order several more of these univeral kits to replace my other kits.
649;An intimate look at Truman Capote .
650;and an opportunity to revisit one of Hoffman's amazing performances.
651;I so enjoyed the director's ability to allow the performances and characters to develop slowly and with thoughtfulness.
652;especially a good cast and storyline.
653;This is an outstanding film.
654;I found it suspenseful and absorbing.
655;this film was interesting at first with a stunning transformation and performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
656;Capote is brilliantly directed with fantastic visuals of the 1950's.
657;i would have liked to see this film done better, with a bit more pace and character as it is a very interesting subject to take on.
658;Phillip Seymour Hoffman won a well deserved Oscar for this movie.
659;He truly is Truman Capote, the legendary writer.
660;ms. Keener as Harper Lee is excellent and the script couldn't have been better.
661;Sometimes grim, but an excellent movie.
662;Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job in this film as capote.
663;so he befriends one of the two killers so he can write his book about what happend that night of the killings.
664;this movie is great a must see!!
665;I had always heard of Truman Capote but never knew anything about him, this movie is engaging and disturbing but one I would watch again.
666;Capote has an effete sophisticated particular and perculiar charm that was intelligent and caring.
667;Acting, directing, scenery all done very well, but even with your eyes closed, this is a good movie.
668;This movie incorporates just about every aspect a great movie should have: tremendous acting, directing, and script.
669;The director, Bennett Clarke, has done wonderfully to evoke the period (late 1950s.
670;The script is spot on, highlighting as if presciently precisely those words and prompting just those actions in the actors to make them completely convincing.
671;"This movie is about acting: Catherine Keener is a brilliantly understated (Nell) Harper Lee
672;It is of course Philip Seymour Hoffman's movie and it is his acting that makes this movie the best of its type.
673;Hoffman's performance was so good that he deserves the oscar for next year as best actor, no matter who his competition is.
674;Really, an amazing (albeit depressing) performance.
675;Now is that great acting or over acting?
676;I can see why Philip Hoffman got an Oscar for this.
677;A captivating movie but a very sad subject matter.
678;Truman Capote was such a talented writer and this film really does bring his story and struggles to life and is brilliantly portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
679;once again, Hoffman did a superb job in his role.
680;Excellent, all of the demons that Capote had to face are brilliantly expressed in the actions of this actor.
681;The story itself is very intriguing and captivating.
682;The writing is some of the best I have seen in a movie in a long time.
683;Everything you have heard about this movie is absolutely correct and this movie isn't something to be missed.
684;Loved the movie and the message it conveyed.
685;I watched it again the next day, and highly recommend the movie.
686;That one created real shock waves in that we lived in Boulder, Colorado.
687;One of my favored authors was Truman Capote and I read a couple of his books.
688;One was the directing and the magnificent capturing of the stark beauty of western Kansas and the depiction of the people.
689;Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman did an absolutely stunning job of portraying Capote in the movie.
690;The story was completely believable and made for compelling viewing.
691;The movie is a stunning portrait of of a tragic event and it's aftermath.
692;Great movie really enjoyed it.
693;I have always loved a true story.
694;This was a good one.
695;An absolutely amazing performance by Phillip Hoffman, as if he had lived in Capote's body and mind and had insight into Capote's thoughts.
696;This is a true TRAGIC story.
697;Cinematography was great, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a very good portrayal of Truman Capote.
698;But this was a simple film with a simple agenda which captured your interest enough to see what happens in the end, but that was about it for me.
699;PSH is stunning, intelligent, and courageous as Truman Capote.
700;We are treated to an artist's passionate and intimate relationship to his craft.
701;This is so well done.
702;i have no idea how this talented actor did the job but it is amazing.
703;takes you inside the workings of Capotewho was a very complex individual.
704;CAPOTE is a great movie.
705;The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel 'In Cold Blood', and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact.
706;Each actor is exceptional here: Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal.
707;but it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film.
708;Hoffman did such an excellent acting job on this film, it affected the rest of his life.
709;For anyone who read the book, I would say, viewing the film is a must.
710;I gave it 5 stars for outstanding acting, editing andverisimilitude.
711;Great acting but hard to follow the dialogue.
712;Interesting story line and review of who Capote was and his influence in writing
713;Good story line with suspense.
714;Liked especially Phillip Seymore Hoffman's portrayal of Capote .
715;Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance alone is worth giving this movie a watch.
716;I would recommend it for anyone who likes these kind of movies or is a fan of Hoffman.
717;Capote is an extraordinary film.
718;capote contains some beautiful sets.
719;It's not an expensive film, I liked how the character Capote is introduced, also liked how he speaks and his character definition and how precisely the director has depicted his state of mind.
720;the film lacked irony, magical moments, whoa inducing twists or sequences, a consistent piano sound in the theme and a character that would be very likeable.
721;however, I got the message of the film, the facts of it, however, Where do I go from there?Possibly one of the best 3star films you'll ever see.
722;Definitely worth watching for those who know what it's about.
723;As a friend of mine said after seeing Capote, """"That movie was ALL Philip Seymour Hoffman!"""""""
724;All the acting is great, but Hoffman carries the film.
725;It's probably the best performance of his career.
726;that being said, the script is great, the cinematography is stunning, and the characters evoke pathos.
727;Seymour did an excellent job in portraying Capote!
728;Probably Seymour's best film and best acting in his career.
729;"Jones' Truman draws the viewer in and charms, while Hoffman's performance in ""Capote"" alienates and repulses to the point that it seems that this actor secretly hates Truman Capote."
730;"Also, ""Infamous"" does a much better job at explaining the story to thise who have not read the book, and giving depth to the other characters than ""Capote""."
731;"Watching ""Infamous"", the dark parts of the story are thrown into sharper relief by the light and humorous parts, and it cuts precisely to the heart of the matter."
732;It was chilling and heartbreaking.
733;When this movie came out I jumped at the chance to see it.
734;Just watching his face tells you so much about the emotions of his character!
735;His portrayal of such a deep and affecting conflict is truly an incredible performance.
736;it's really great, and I couldn't take my eyes off to the movie.
737;I do was really absorbed.
738;Hoffman was an amazing actor, and I feel sorry for his death.
739;Capote was an excellent movie.
740;What a wonderful job PSH did playing the Capote.
741;A real insite into his life.
742;Loved the film Phillip Seymore Hoffman is stellar in this.
743;We both agree this was a solid ( good ) movie.
744;Its a real life story of a writers view on a small town murder.
745;Interesting, between a thriller and drama.
746;Acting of main characters and others superb.
747;Felt the movie brought the book and story to life.
748;Liked the convenience of watching this great movie on my kindle.
749;This was the role played by a very young Robert Blake in 1967 in the very good Richard Brooks film.
750;Blake captures the complexity of this extremely complicated murderer .
751;Perry Smith is one of the biggest acting challenges of modern movies.
752;"In ""Capote"" it's a huge role."
753;The conversations between him and Capote in the jail cell are the core of the film.
754;But, with all of that said, the film is worth seeing for Hoffman's work.
755;The performance is at once nuanced and over the top.
756;Every scene that Hoffman is in is a mesmerizing delight.
757;Oscar for best actor that year?
758;Amazing performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman .
759;Best Actor Oscar truly earned.
760;Regarding he is a young and talented actor, something inside me tells me he reached that genius trait, this sublime peak achieved for others actors.
761;Many people, especially those old enough to remember when the book In Cold Blood came out, know about the hoopla caused by Capote's best known work.
762;Yet, we see into the heart and soul of the writer and killer who so fascinated Capote, even if only for a moment.
763;The subject alone is chilling.
764;There are two characters here who demonstrate the thin line between genius and madness.
765;The quiet telling of that story makes the impact even more powerful.
766;The acting was very spot on.
767;It is much greater move than this.
768;It balances out hrrible crime and Truman's life style and personality.
769;The main character in that move is a really great actor.
770;What a staggeringly novel concept!!
771;He wants to write about how the murders affected the people in town, but ends up befriending one of the murderers and promising them he will help them in their trial.
772;"this is an honest movie
773;Capote is a fascinating man to watch and he presents us with witty lines all through the movie with his ability to see the irony in all worst.
774;This is one of the greater movies released in this century.
775;for one not to confuse one's own feelings (considering oneself """"sympathetic"""" and """"sensitive"""") with genuine empathy, the genuine love for mankind that makes John Donne's famous sonnet with the oft."""
776;"quoted phrase ""No man is an island, entire unto himself"" so stunningly apposite and powerfully true."
777;this film is about the creation of that book and the nature and character of Truman Capote, increasingly revealed throughout the course of the film as the book and the interviews its writing entailed become all.
778;capote himself is depicted with brutal honesty .
779;"centredness, his egocentric desire to be the centre of attention, his callousness in the face of the desperation desire to live, and to be understood, on the part of the two killers, his uninterest even in the success of his friend Harper Lee in the wake of the publishing of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", and his almost unbelievably expressed desire to have ""it"" over with (""it"" being the execution of the two killers)."
780;the complexity of this film is remarkably well done.
781;It's beautifully paced, subtle and powerful .
782;I can only say it worked beautifully for me.
783;capote's relationship with one of the killers .
784;And it is in Perry Smith's life that the film shows hints of what led to the murders .
785;The internal callousness of this young man, who in many ways was sensitive and thoughtful, simply led to a knee.
786;"It is based upon this intimate understanding that the true chills of the ""In Cold Blood"" title of the book makes its most powerful appeal."
787;"but in this film ""Capote"", the coldness is uncannily apt with respect to Capote's own behaviour and emotions."
788;His masterpiece must be published .
789;this is the pivotal thought in Capote's mind.
790;the cinematography is wonderfully done in this film.
791;I loved the pace of the film.
792;I can say it is powerful and thought.
793;provoking, and the friend with whom I saw the film and I have found it richly working in our minds so that we have discussed it in depth.
794;"I remember reading ""In Cold Blood"" and finding it riveting."
795;This revelation makes the movie worth watching in itself.
796;I think the identification is what made the book so powerful.
797;What higher price can one pay for creating a great work of art?
798;It seems to me, that the creative genius in him was hung with Perry Smith.
799;incredible movie, a must see, I think.
800;I caught a sneak preview of Capote at the ArcLight earlier this evening and I have to say: Dammmmnnnnnn!Capote is based on the true story of how Truman Capote, one of America's legendary writers, came to write his masterpiece non.
801;The film concentrates on Capote's interaction with the lead killer through the meetings he managed to arrange for them in jail.
802;It captures the late '50s and early '60s impeccably with flawless set dressing and imposed film grain.
803;Capote's interesting life was touched upon with certain aspects highlighted such as his friendship with Harper Lee.
804;philip Seymor Huffman should win an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Truman Capote.
805;His accent, posture, gestures and most subtle inflections were perfection.
806;He definitely delivered the best performance by an actor in a leading role this year thus far.
807;everyone should see this film!
808;It's a terrific story with stellar performances.
809;"Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Director and Screenplay) ""Capote"" was my favorite film of 2005."
810;Director Bennett Miller has made a beautiful film with uniformly brilliant performances.
811;Catherine Keener (an Oscar nominee for her work here) plays Nell Harper Lee with great understatement.
812;"crime masterpiece ""In Cold Blood."
813;He did pay for their first appeal.
814;Was he actually honor bound to do more on their behalf?
815;These are the issues the film brilliantly explores.
816;"In the end ""Capote"" presents one of the most acutely realized and compelling examinations of personal and professional ethics in relation to the creative process, and the often corrupting influence the persuit of greatness can have on the artist."
817;This is a must see film.
818;I always find it fascinating when two movies about the same topic come out very closely together.
819;He even manages to make Capote somewhat sexy.
820;With the exception of Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee, the rest of the Infamous cast is outshined by Capote's cast.
821;The love story is a little too subtle, but the interaction between Capote's Truman and Smith works really well.
822;Infamous has lighter and funnier moments, but it can at times come off as frivolous.
823;"Capote was released first
824;But I like and enjoy both films"
825;Glue them together, and maybe you'll get one accurate picture of Truman Capote.
826;The script by Dan Futterman was so gripping.
827;A must see for everyone.
828;I enjoyed the acting and I can see why Philip Seymour Hoffman won an oscar but I still dotn think it was the best acting od the year and I can see why Catherine Keener was nominated becouse she is a great actress but the story was boring.
829;"How Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I read somewhere is 6'2"", thoroughly becomes the elfin Truman Capote is one of the greater acting mysteries of the year, but he does and as a result Capote is a terrific movie in every frame."
830;Beginning with the Clutter family murders in rural Kansas and covering Capote's struggles to write In Cold Blood, the movie also has superb acting by Catherine Keener (last seen bringing sanity to the world of middle.

837;Movie audiences have always loved movies about movies.
838;And even more so, movies about very popular movies.
839;Capote is a movie about the writing of a book that became a very popular movie.
840;"The critics certainly loved Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the tortured novelist and the movie Capote
841;in Cold Blood has long been considered one of the most realistic crime dramas ever filmed, and it's considered a high.
842;point of 1960's cinema, mostly for it's documentary style.
843;In the film Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote mentions that In Cold Blood represented a new type of literary accomplishment, a work based on fact presented in the style of narrative fiction.
844;In order to gain their trust, Capote had to develop a friendship with the killers, and in fact, his friendship Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) borders on obsession.
845;We are never quite sure throughout the film exactly what is going on inside Capote's head"
846;some of the scenes lifted from those in the original film In Cold Blood are done so well that, aside from the fact that the original was filmed in black and white, you can scarcely tell the difference.
847;on the whole, the film is dramatically satisfying and extremely entertaining.
848;Coupled with the extraordinary performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, it emerges as a near perfect motion picture.
849;This movie is worth seeing.
850;It is an good film.
851;I enjoyed Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote.
852;I was surprised to learn about his close friendship with Harper Lee.
853;We remember Truman Capote well and the actor did an outstanding job portraying him.
854;I have vivid memories of Truman Capote on the talk show curcuit.
855;Phillip Seymour Hoffman's betrayal of Truman Capote ranks as one of the absolute best performances ever, and for that reason alone, Capote should not be missed!
856;I went to see this movie not knowing the story of Truman Capote, I found it to be very interesting the character was so original and likable.
857;Of course the acting was brilliant, I've see a lot of Philip Seymour Hoffman movies, as I wondered when he would get the chance to show how good his acting skills is.
858;If you haven't seen them trust me their impressive.
859;this is a very Dramatic movie if you like these types of films that show you the truth in style Example Schindlers List you will love this.
860;"Selecting the final segment in the life of author Truman Capote, the film ""Capote"", delves into the inner and certainly troubled soul of the American Novelist."
861;With the help of an assortment of great actors, such as Bruce Greenwood (Jack Dunphy) and Chris Cooper, Alvin Dewey) the film exhibits the enormous talent, and human flaws which made Capote a household word.
862;Like an excellent novel, the movie is slow to build, but eventually achieves a touching tribute to the man.
863;The first of the two films made in 2005 about Truman Capote's writing of IN COLD BLOOD, CAPOTE got the lion's share of the critics' attention and won a Best Actor Oscar for Philip Seymour Hoffman as the eponymous writer who found the story that would make him rich in the murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas in 1959.
864;consciously artistic: it has gorgeous cinematography by Adam Kimmel of the haunted and empty Kansas plains (Manitoba being used as that state's stand.
865;the film is quite fine on its own terms, and has a superlative performance by Catherine Keener as the author Harper Lee, who accompanied her childhood friend Capote to Holcomb for his first long research trip and who listens with patience and forbearance to her friend's egotistical and insensitive rants.
866;Interesting and intriguing to say the least.
867;Thanks for making it a 'prime' feature.
868;Using his reputation as a famous author, as well as his considerable personal charm, Capote works his way past accepted social boundaries.
869;Invited into the local sheriff's apartment (via a link to the sheriff's wife, who is also a writer) he manages to make contact with one of the killers, imprisoned (weirdly) in a cell built into the kitchen.
870;His continued efforts to keep everyone feeding him sensitive and even damaging information .
871;while simultaneously reaping the benefits of public adulation .
872;Capote teaches a bit about the author's life, but much about his soul.
873;If the film is true to life, Capote was transformed from a man.
874;town into a caring human being who was all but destroyed by the experience of writing his book.
875;Catherine Keener's portrayal of Capote's friend, author Harper Lee, was solid and grounded the movie in reality and a modicum of period social morality.
876;Clifton Collins, Jr. gave a phenomenal performance as erudite, sensitive killer Perry Smith.
877;The film was ensemble work of the highest caliber.
878;"in for the ""Best Movie"" Oscar."
879;as it is, though, the movie tells a chilling and compelling tale of the writing of one of the 20th century's ground.
880;"The movie's success can be measured in my visceral lack of interest in reading ""In Cold Blood"" in the foreseeable future!"
881;The thesis, metaphors, and empathizing in order to get inside the minds of the characters is really revealing.
882;Either way its a great film.
883;this is a very good and well.
884;made (5 stars), quite intriguing but unenjoyable (1 star) film.
885;top depiction of Truman Capote .
886;take a look at some interviews with the real.
887;Great performances by Keener and Cooper.
888;Deserves all the acclaim that it got.
889;If you like art films with talk, talk and more talk.
890;this is the film for you.
891;I just want to be entertained.
892;It is a moving account of the real life writer Truman Capote (Duh!)
893;Watch the party scene, as he performs and delights the entire party, he is a man possessed.
894;Of the nominated films for best picture, I would give sway to Brokeback Mountain, but in here lies by far the most incredible performance of the year.
895;It may not always be 100% accurate, but it is spectacular.
896;Interesting view into the tortured genius of Truman Capote.
897;Phillip Seymour Hoffman was an amazing actor, and whatever.
898;Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists.
899;Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehending are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re.
900;this movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best.
901;selling and important work, In Cold Blood.
902;The result is very affecting.
903;Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.
904;The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles.
905;and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize.
906;This was a very enjoyable movie.
907;Very well acted, Phillip became Truman.
908;Very ell acted I enjoyed this movie completely
909;"In every frame you see this charismatic opportunist and maybe 40 percent decent person use every angle he can to obtain what he really wants
910;the point of the movie is pretty clear and bares a fair resemblance to reality.
911;open up new ways of thinking to the reader.
912;i think this movie will stay in the lexicon of great film for some time.
913;This movie shows that Capote sold his soul in order to produce the book.
914;Capote befriended Perry Smith, one of the killers.
915;phillip Seymur Hoffman is brilliant in his interpretation.
916;Capote got into the minds of the killers and did a good job of putting that into words in his book.
917;great performance, he was perfect playing the part.
918;Wow is all that I can say.
919;Philip Seymour Hoffman was just amazing and very deserving of his Oscar win for best actor in Capote.
920;fiction novel of """"In Cold Blood"""" was just amazing."""
921;What is amazing is the range to these two actors, they both can do comedy, both can do action and both can do a serious dialog driven film.
922;"what range and what perfect people to play these two famous people as Keener played the understudy, friend of Capote who had her own career with ""To Kill a Mocking Bird."""
923;Capote was simply on of the most brilliant and complex writers of the 20th century.
924;He seems to shink in size to fit, yet the character grows larger and more rich as the movie goes along.
925;Catherine Keener as Harper Lee is a revelation.
926;All the supporting actors play their roles brilliantly.
927;The screenplay is tight, focusing on the priod when Capote wrote In Cold Blood, still one of the most chilling books I've ever read.
928;Highlly recommend, perhaps the best movie I've seen in a couple of years.
929;this is so beautifully played out in the movie's climax when Capote visits the two men immediately prior to their executions.
930;He tries to say something and can only manage choked sobs.
931;In particular, his lover, Jack Dunphy and his childhood friend, Harper Lee.

943;A layered, complex piece about a tragic event, and one profoundly disillusioned man who used it to create his last, most enduring work.
944;What a fantastic movie about Truman Capote.
945;A complex man that was a total mixture of talent and driven by wanting the true story behind his book In Cold Blood .
946;"Not a biography, but the story of his sometimes tortuous journey writing his masterpiece, ""In Cold Blood."""
947;He met many rural folks from the area and develops close relationships in the course of his research, including with the condemned men.
948;He helps the men postpone their execution.
949;An excellent film and deserving of it's awards.
950;So well acted by one of the best!
951;Capote's spirit shines through in this classic film
952;It had my wife and I talking for several days.
953;It is an amazing character study.
954;Phillip Seymour Hoffman did an incredible job portraying Capote.
955;This was a wonderful film.

964;one of the greatest acting jobs ive ever seen.
965;It was amazing watching his performance in this movie.
966;Hoffman's acting ability is at it's peak and is validated by his Acedmy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.
967;a master at work and a great script make this a great film for anyone who loves film or literature and for that matter, life itself.

971;cAPOTE is the cinematic depiction of Truman's 4.
972;hoffman's Capote is 5 stars and worthy of an Oscar nomination.
973;I would be satisfied if he wins, regardless of the others nominated for Best Actor in pictures that may not even have been released yet, because his performance as the brilliant, tormented, self.

975;"angle shots of the ""Kansas"" landscape (actually filmed in Manitoba), and the visual jolt when, towards the film's end, Smith reveals to Capote what actually happened in the Clutter farmhouse."
976;This is a nuanced look at the making of an American truish crime classic and some of Philip Seymour Hoffman's best work.
977;I gave it a good grade and moved on, looking at the movie as a disappointment when it caught my eye at a video store.
978;I don't always agree with the order of the list, but I usually agree that they're great films.
979;It was free and I had nothing else to watch and watching it now I appreciate it a lot more.
980;and enjoyed it a lot more.
981;This movie does not achieve greatness merely from a great performance or a great atmosphere.
982;First of all, I want to talk about Hoffman's Oscar winning performance.
983;Yes he won the Oscar, beating out three other actors who played real life people, but people still say that he didn't deserve it.
984;This is an unfair statement.
985;The movie has an Oscar nominated script by actor Dan Futterman, who has (like most other screen.
986;This sends the town into frenzy and gives novelist/screenwriter Truman Capote an idea for a newspaper article.
987;"He travels to Kansas with his friend, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" novelist Nelle ""Harper"" Lee (Catherine Keener, in an Oscar worthy, and nominated, performance), and begins research."
988;Soon, the killers are caught and Capote finds himself surprised.
989;fiction novel, the first of its kind.
990;He begins interviewing Smith and Hickok, but finds a connection with Smith.
991;A sweet man, whom people loved to talk too.
992;A dedicated, smart novelist with a fantastic memory.
993;bent on writing a great novel, despite the fact a friend has to die for him to complete it.
994;The scenes between Capote and Smith are truly heartbreaking.
995;Chris Cooper also turns in a strong performance as the head of the murder investigation, Alvin Dewey.
996;Capote was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
997;The movie has a stark, gray atmosphere to it.
998;One of the strongest performances in the film belongs to Collins Jr. as Smith.
999;While I admit that this isn't the most entertaining film in the world (I found myself looking at the clock a few times), it was one of the best films of 2005 and it is very engrossing.
1000;There's some great scenes (that many could claim are out of place) where Capote will talk about various exploits.
1001;"One, which I found amusing, was about the writing process of a John Huston film called ""Beat the Devil."""
1002;If you know what movie he is talking about and know about Bogart, this story is particularly amusing.
1003;One of the things that works best about a scene like that is you realize that if you were at a party with Capote and he was talking about something that you knew about, he would really hold your attention.
1004;Great acting, a solid script, great directing, awesome cinematography, a wonderful atmosphere, although does grow a bit dull at times.
1005;The movie, especially the performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was very good, and prompted me to learn more about Truman Capote.
1006;Capote is about Truman Capote's writing of his nonfiction masterpiece, In Cold Blood.
1007;In my mind, it ranks right up there with the book.
1008;To my surprise I was very pleased with the move Capote.
1009;The acting was superb, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1010;The movie is brilliantly acted, so much so that I was saddened by Capote's immense self.
1011;Even the relatively small part he played as a hospice worker in 1999's Magnolia was superb among a hgost of superb performances (and Tom Cruise's best, in my opinion).
1012;What I got was surprisingly intense and memorable.
1013;He was certainly worthy of an Oscar.
1014;Shut your eyes at the end.
1015;Outstanding performance by the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman!
1016;i read everything Capote wrote and I do this yearly, because it is so damned great.
1017;one wonders about Capote, his southern bent.
1018;The acting was so steeped in what certainly must be Truman Capote,spectacularly!
1019;I also loved the actress who portrayed the calm and anchored, Harper Lee.
1020;were their death sentences really that meaningful and important?
1021;I loved this movie, this film explains or offers a a perspective of Capotes interest, change and leap of genres as well as his writing/story research and development.
1022;The film, is carried and marvelous seen, embodied and epressed.
1023;{acted},through the amazing, and incredibly gifted late actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1024;i think this film is help in see a side of Truman Capote and a chapter or portion of his life.
1025;"if anyone reading has not read the book, and then seen the movie entitled, In Cold Blood 
1026;This was a gripping story and revealed so much about the real Capote and the men who committed the crime.
1027;Need to watch more than once.
1028;Great acting and Philip Seymore Hoffman worthy of the oscar!!
1029;I come from a family of addiction and have heard so many cruel things said about the man, may God forgive them all.
1030;At first Capote plans to write a short story about the killings, but as he digs further into the circumstances, he realizes that it has the makings of a great novel.
1031;The film focuses on his conversations with one of the killers, Perry Smith, who has a background which is remarkably similar to Capote's.
1032;A friendship develops, which surprises both men.
1033;made film which poses some very interesting ethical questions.
1034;Truman Capote is still one of the most unique figures in American fiction, a gifted writer who never lived up to his promises, producing only a handful short stories and novels, yet managing to far surpass the quantity of his work as a self styled breathing piece of art,a quirky icon of jet set living, superficial glamour,addiction and the tragedy that was inevitable.
1035;His most famous work, a groundbreaking new type of novel, In Cold Blood, is also his most revealing.
1036;It is a story of brilliance and the depth that he sank to in order to achieve it.
1037;His strange lisping way of speaking and unusual demeanor at first cause only curiosity and suspicion, but with intelligence, resourcefulness, a little bribery and the help of his Nelle he manages to win the trust of the grieving locals, including the no nonsense chief investigator Alvin Dewey(Chris Cooper).
1038;With his usual tactics of persuasion"
1039;By opening himself to the lonely man and arranging for an appeal by finding them a new lawyer, Capote gains not only Perry's trust, but important material for his book.
1040;Hoffman, though sharing only a vague resemblance and being taller then the actual Truman Capote, gives a fantastically disciplined performance.
1041;His good conscience and quite strength is Nelle Harper Lee,Catherine Keener in an absolutely likable performance,who is aware of his betrayal and does not pretend otherwise.
1042;She persuades Truman to give one last heart wrenching visit to Perry and Richard, confronting him with the truth, even though she realizes that it is tearing him up from the inside.
1043;Perry knows what Truman knows.
1044;Although perfectly imitating Capotes demeanor,Hoffman's Capote is yet a bit more appealing and the collapse of his moral character more dramatic then what happened in real life.
1045;Capote is excellent and poignant drama, acted in sincere heartfeltness.
1046;The acting in this movie was excellent all across the board.
1047;The portrayal of Truman Capote himself was believable and well in line with the real life glimpses of Capote seen on television during his lifetime.
1048;It was a convincing and entertaining film.
1049;This was not just an incredible movie, but the screenplay and PSH portrayal of TC was over the top!
1050;A must for anyone's classic movie library!
1051;This movie carefully brought to life a slice out of history that was in all the news at the time.
1052;He was spot on in his portrayal of Capote.
1053;All the more because it was true.
1054;Phlip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding in this movie.
1055;he did an amazing job, definitely worthy of the Oscar he received.
1056;Liked the movie, didn't think other characters were fleshed out but was an interesting movie.
1057;Would recommend to anyone interested in the writing of the book In Cold Blood .
1058;It was a great movie.
1059;He loves to hear himself talk, and he loves it when people compliment his writing.
1060;Why shouldn't he love it, his work is incredibly brilliant.
1061;They share stories about their pasts and how both of them seem to be outcasts of society.
1062;When he finally probes the information out of Perry a whole new side of this man is revealed.
1063;The film is psychologically haunting.
1064;We have Truman Capote, a very eccentric yet brilliant homosexual writer.
1065;The film digs deep on Truman's character, and just enough for Perry's.
1066;When the end comes and we learn the truth about the murders, we see a change in both characters.
1067;The film also boasts some very subtle yet amazing cinematography.
1068;The film also has some amazing lighting, and the lighting on the faces is another subtlety to notice.
1069;The haunting score by Mychael Danna is amazing.
1070;The film is a deep and dark look into the human mind, and human emotion.
1071;I felt it was just an interest in a person who is deemed a monster yet is a very poignant person.
1072;The film was brilliant and haunting, and is worth your while.
1073;aCTING: Phillip Seymore Hoffman gives a tour de force performance of Truman Capote.
1074;Not only did he capture the pompous nature of the writer, but he captured the emotion within him as a human being.
1075;Clifton Collins Jr. gives an amazing performance as the very ambiguous Perry Smith.
1076;The two actors also play off each other very well, their acting envelopes the audience into the atmosphere of the film and makes their conversations all the more emotional.
1077;Both actors are worthy of nominations, and Hoffman may have given a performance that translates into Oscar.
1078;bOTTOM LINE: While some people may find the first quarter of the film slow, it picks up and ends up being one of those movies that stays with you long after you see it.
1079;The performances are stellar, and they add to the film's effect on the audience.
1080;Bennet Miller's direction is on the mark as he spends the right amount of time with each character, and he sets up the third act of the film perfectly
1081;I prefer enjoyable films, but hey, thats just me.
1082;how full of yourself can you get .
1083;funny story I actually thought it was about Al Capone which is why I even clicked on it .
1084;He's due to win for something.
1085;Frankly, the only memorable performance in Capote was that of the convicted criminals.
1086;Not only did it tell a story that Truman should have told himself, but it proved you can make a wonderful film for not a lot of money.
1087;It's through Hoffman's subtle portrayal of human fragility that you find yourself empathizing with Capote, who, as it turns out, is the true antagonist of the film .
1088;Capote is one of the more thought provoking movies I've seen this year, in which viewers are given a long, almost agonizing look into the heart, soul and angst of author/celebrity Truman Capote.
1089;And the subject matter guarantees some gruesome elements which are there.
1090;If you love to look into a soul and discover what makes it unique and fragile, you may find that this film is a gem.
1091;This is a good movie.
1092;It's an incredible first effort for director Bennett Miller.
1093;star stellar, but brilliant stellar) introduction to one of the most intriguing 20th century English.
1094;Seymour and everyone here is very natural, very fresh, very comfortable with each other (or, like in the case with the sherriff of Holcomb, very comfortable being uncomfortable with Seymour's character).
1095;Even though he feels he can win Perry over, Perry senses this, and there is a genuine back and forth with the characters in the film.
1096;in summary, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, the development of most of the main characters, namely Truman, his friend Nelle (Harper Lee), and Perry Smith, is fairly good.
1097;"i thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat."""
1098;What did they say?In the meantime, I will look forward to both Mr. Miller and Mr. Seymour's next efforts.
1099;First of all the acting of the man playing Truman Capote, Phillip Seymore Hoffman is some of the best art of acting ever produced.
1100;Secondly the casting was brilliant right down to the school girls in Danny Birk's school.
1101;But he died showing us a picture of ourselves that few of his intelligence and talent have the courage to do.
1102;Great acting and 2 stories in one.
1103;I got this movie to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his acclaimed roles.
1104;Yes, I knew it when I ordered it.
1105;Does not change the fact that Capote is a great movie
1106;"I knew the story of ""In Cold Blood"" and learning how Truman Capote came to write it, was a story within a story and was very interesting."
1107;The acting was excellent,the movie though true was just ok.
1108;I Was surprised at how moving it was.
1109;He fully captured the man and his struggles.
1110;Good story about historic figure.
1111;He is joined by his assistant and best friend, Nelle Harper Lee, who later wrote *To Kill a Mockingbird*.
1112;Anyways, the relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting.
1113;it takes Capote four years to write this book.
1114;Initially, Capote is excited about this prospect.
1115;philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job as Capote.
1116;I liked him the moment I first saw him in *Talented Mr. Ripley*.
1117;This was indeed his best film yet.
1118;minute whisper over one of the most startling real life events in the last half of the 20th century.
1119;He is more a caricature of the real man, who was perhaps the ugliest man that ever lived in the United States.
1120;Hoffman not only presented a Richard Gere caricature of Capote, with his beautiful facial lines set against the real life Capote's egg.
1121;shaped head, his elegance and eloquence were more a match for a character at Tiffany's than for the real flesh and blood man.
1122;no matter, I suppose, for now this is a done deal and most people accepted it as the best characterization to date.
1123;Still, that characterization is rarely enough to carry the heavy weight of this film, which is bolstered by fine support from the likes of Chris Cooper.
1124;The wieight I refer to is the feature moving at a glacial pace in darkened scenes that mimic film noir.
1125;in prior films of the nature, including Cliff Robertson's Oscar.
1126;"winning characterization as ""Charly"" and Al Pacino's prize as the blind tough guy in ""Scent of A Woman"" ."
1127;moving beast of a movie.
1128;I thought the acting was very good in that a actor has to really live a character of this type.
1129;"Knowing his downward trajectory during the last 15 years of his life makes ""Capote,"" the outstanding film about Truman Capote's years researching and writing ""In Cold Blood,"" even more riveting."
1130;winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman is astonishing, not only because his impersonation of Capote's strained, high, tiny voice and his fussy mannerisms is so remarkably good, but because he moves effortlessly between charm and seemingly endless empathy to self.
1131;absorption of enormous proportion so smoothly and naturally.
1132;We both admire and revile him.
1133;In their roles, excellent actors Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener show indulgence and affection for him, as well as wariness and disgust with his deceit of others, of them, of himself.
1134;"The script is often spare and the pacing, while perfect, is never rushed
1135;His actions and the reactions of others are carefully calibrated so that we are never in the dark as to what is going on or how his actions will reverberate, but we are trusted to be able to let the story build in our minds"
1136;This is how a subtle story should be told.
1137;Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film!!!
1138;The movie real had me wondering as to the sincerity of Capote's friendship with Perry Smith.
1139;thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman did an excellent job at portraying Capote and now see why he won the Academy Award for Best Actor!!
1140;How can one really do a good job of focusing on one individuals life in two hours?Thought the movie was visually stunning, had striking costumes, wonderful cinematography, interesting screenplay, and dynamic performances by the cast members.
1141;Highly recommend watching this film!
1142;If Hoffman wins the Best Actor Oscar tomorrow night as is expected, part of it will be because of the respected body of work he has produced in films over the last decade, but the majority will be because of this finely nuanced performance that is so far removed from the caricature it could have been that we accept him as Capote and are suitable impressed.
1143;"after reading ""In Cold Blood,"" I was really intrigued with the Clutter family, the setting, the method of the murders, and the murderers themselves."
1144;Crime scenes fascinate me, as I'm sure they do others, and I bet I wasn't the only disappointed viewer.
1145;it's nice to know that Capote was as self.
1146;interesting, but not nearly as creepy and haunting as the book.
1147;THIS is the mark of acting that transcends being even great.
1148;"even that is a trace of the brilliance that bursts on the screen here in ""Capote""."
1149;he forges a relationship with convicted mass murderer Perry Smith that is heartbreaking and more emotionally powerful than any conventional love story has portrayed a relationship in many years on screen.
1150;Then he can turn right around and exchange bon mots at a cocktail party and be completely convincing as a quick.
1151;witted social butterfly with a sly biting sense of humor.
1152;i have to confess that I was riveted to the screen.
1153;Catherine Keener was also really good, as was Chris Cooper and Bob Balaban and Bruce Greenwood and the actor playing Perry Smith (in fact, the latter was excellent).
1154;But this is really Hoffman's film.
1155;"I think you can tell that he knows he had great material to work with
1156;right from the start we can see this is no ordinary character.
1157;it's not just that Capote is gay"
1158;This is a combination of personality traits that is almost unique.
1159;or at the very least, very very rare.
1160;Catherine Keener as Lee is great.
1161;"see film and, along with ""The Squid and the Whale"" should be counted as one of the top ten American films of 2005."
1162;Very riveting and keeps you focused until the very end.
1163;It was very entertaining and the acting was very good.
1164;I've always thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman was a wonderful actor.
1165;And this film, which will probably win him an Oscar nomination, really brings out his talent.
1166;Highly intelligent and an eccentric, he was public about his lifestyle and was known for his exaggerated effete mannerisms and self absorption.
1167;She a dear friend of Capote's since childhood and traveled with him to help him with his research.
1168;She and Capote smoke a lot of cigarettes and drink a lot of martinis.
1169;I applaud the director, Bennett Miller, for being able to capture these multifaceted elements of each of the characters.
1170;this is a really fine film.
1171;I see many awards in its future.
1172;And make up your own mind.
1173;This an extraordinary film with superb acting.
1174;Capote's highs and lows in the process keep him in an emotional prison while his subjects remain incarcerated.
1175;altering and profound period for him I admit, but the title led me to believe there would be a look into his background.
1176;The performances were superb and the story captivating, and brilliantly written.
1177;Of course, I'd read the book decades ago, and saw an earlier movie version of In Cold Blood that was excellent.
1178;Capote is the best film I've seen for many, many years.
1179;I like to come out of a film with my mind racing, and this film did just that.
1180;realised portrayal of a man who fashioned his own caricature.
1181;It's also wonderful to see that an almost shoe.
1182;string budget (by Hollywood standards) can produce such a compelling result.
1183;Chris Cooper as Dewey and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee are superb, as is Mark Pelligrino in the small but effective role of Dick Hickock.
1184;It demands attention and rewards concentration.
1185;I hope, after the Oscar success, more people will give it the attention is deserves.
1186;Phillips Seymour Hoffman's best performance.
1187;He was the best actor of our time.
1188;"Having read and loved Truman Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood, I was eager to see the ""story"" behind the creation of this book."
1189;however, if you are familiar with Capote and are in awe of In Cold Blood, you will probably enjoy the film.
1190;A true tribute to the genius and suffering of Truman Capote.
1191;This film helped me to understand the reason he never wrote another after In Cold Blood .
1192;Naturally, the story of an ambitious eccentric who inserts himself into a major news event with seemingly little concern for the real people involved has great resonance with me.
1193;"The film also provides fascinating insight into the literary world of the 1960s
1194;It's in the story of Capote's relationship with a convicted killer, Robert Blake, that we see what an innovator the man really was.

1196;The whole film made me want to pull out my well.
1197;the Best Picture of the year!
1198;i had seen the movie In Cold Blood but, to see the behind the scenes of it all was very informative.
1199;I would say it is worth watching if you enjoy serious movies.
1200;I really learned a lot about one of my favorite writers, not just he is Gay but he is also a great humanitarian with a great mind too.
1201;It is a great movie and the main character portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing.
1202;It helps you learn to dislike Mr. Capote, but it never lets you guess what's coming next.
1203;Mr. Hoffman lets you believe you are actually watching Mr. Capote as his story is told.
1204;Philip Seymour Hoffman gives an Oscar winning performance as Truman Capote, a wonderful writer from Alabama with the whiniest voice I have ever heard.
1205;He decides right away what his new writing topic will be and with support from his employer, The New Yorker, he goes down with his friend played by Catherine Keener, to get the story.
1206;The film takes place over 5 years as Capote interacts first with the town people, the law enforcement people and finally the murderers themselves.
1207;The most intense and troubling relationships are with the prisoners while they await trail and later execution.
1208;A good parallel movie to In Cold Blood and a good introduction to the book and the author.
1209;As it turns out, Mr. Phil Hoffman wins an academy award for his performance in Capote.
1210;Is he worth the title: yes!
1211;Probably, aside from the story of one of the greatest writers in our life, Hoffman's performance should be the main reason why this movies needs to be in people's homes.
1212;"He is true to himself and to his audience, without ever overdoing the character or badly imitating him in any way
1213;The director does a good job in telling a 5 year long story through Capote's eyes"
1214;The music was good.1 star .
1215;the casting team, as I already said, did a great job choosing all the actors that took part in this project.
1216;Those supporting roles aren't that supporting: they are as important as Capote's roles.
1217;When will another actor come along that had the talent of the late and great Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1218;His portrayal of Capote was one of the most remarkable acting performances I have ever seen.
1219;In my humble opinion, PSH was right along side Brando.
1220;If you like outstanding acting, watch this movie.
1221;Philip Seymour Hoffman was totally believable in his portrayal.
1222;I am all the more saddened by this outstanding actor's untimely demise.
1223;A sad story, brilliantly retold and casted.
1224;an unforgettable performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1225;he is truly one of a kind.
1226;What a magnificent actor .
1227;It was a great story .

1288;The film sufficiently sparked my interest and with a little internet research I was able to verify much of the information contained in the film as factual.

1338;Surprisingly Truman Capote's homosexuality, an issue the American media has specifically taken up in labeling the film a politically motivated picture, is firmly downplayed.
1339;Dynamically scored, artistically choreographed, and rich dialogue, Capote is without question `the' movie to beat this year for Best Picture.
1340;An all around great movie.
1341;I watched In Cold Blood and then this movie for an entertaining, thought.
1342;I saw this film simply because I've read and loved the book which is the centerpiece of this film.
1343;The most amazing aspect of the movie is it actually builds on Capote's book by providing insight into the process that doesn't exist if you have only read the book.
1344;what I found most engaging about the movie was the life given to the convicted killers.

1350;The movie about Capote's writing it relives the tale.
1351;All that aside, the acting in this production is exceptional, the story line gripping.
1352;Capote takes us to the dark side of the American story in more ways than one.
1353;born in 1924 in Alabama, Truman Capote wanted fame and success more than most.
1354;He has been described as the most perfect writer of his generation.
1355;That last Capote is the one who lingered in the public imagination, and Hoffman does a superb job at revealing the lonely as well as the extroverted public persona.
1356;What an extraordinary and brilliant performance.
1357;It will give you chills.You know you have seen a good movie when you walk out of the theater and can't stop thinking about it.
1358;It disturbed me, moved me and with blind eyes I'd recommend it to anyone.
1359;What a marvelous piece of cinema.
1360;Capote is a story of a writer creating his greatest work: Truman Capote's research and authorship of """"In Cold Blood"""", his """"non."""
1361;Drawing from Gerald Clarke's biography of Capote, screenwriter Dan Futterman has written a gripping character study of a fascinating man at the peak of his talents.
1362;Capote boasts superb performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Clifton Collins, among others.
1363;This is the most physically challenging role I've seen Hoffman in, and portraying such a widely recognized and distinctive individual is risky.
1364;Clifton Collins spends a lot of time admirably providing Hoffman someone to act off of, but when Perry's words and emotions become more vital, his performance is powerful.
1365;What makes the film truly great, however, is how deliberate it is.
1366;Director Bennett Miller has created a work of outstanding craftsmanship.
1367;"Every frame of ""Capote"" is stunning, from the subdued color palette to Adam Kimmel's beautiful cinematography to the restrained depiction of Capote's manipulations and machinations."

1372;Truman Capote was a very complex Character&I think that Philip Seymour Hoffman nailed the role.
1373;so in this respect, the acting was very good, and if it is true to the real person's way of being, you certainly geta little glimpse into Capote's personal character.
1374;i would recommend the movie to anyone just to experience this one story in Capote's life.
1375;Philip Seymour Hoffman is at his best and well.
1376;deserving of the best actor academy award.
1377;You will enjoy this biographical portrait of a complex author.
1378;The film was enjoyable and treated the subject with some depth rather than a standard Hollywood gloss.
1379;The empathy Capote had with Perry Smith came across as a genuine synergy.
1380;While Seymour Hoffman obviously strives for authenticity, the difficulty I had with hearing and understanding what was said, detracted from my enjoyment of the film.
1381;Acting was great and I liked the fact that it was based on a true story
1382;It was quite a great movie in it's own rite.
1383;Capote was very enlightening and compelling.
1384;From there we see how Capote works his way into interviewing the killers to begin writing his book.
1385;The movie does a great job of conveying the emotion of everyone involved and what it does to life of Capote.
1386;He becomes obsessed with one of the killers, Perry Smith, played wonderfully by Clifton Collins Jr.
1387;He actually pays for the first of their appeals.
1388;Capote battles his emotions as we see he actually does feel compassion for Perry while at the same time knowing the man won't talk about the night of the murders which he needs to complete his book.
1389;Hoffman does an incredible job of portraying these mixed emotions.
1390;this is definitely one of the best movies of the year.
1391;The performance of Hoffman alone is enough to see the film.
1392;Let's hope he gets his due at the Oscars.
1393;I really enjoyed the movie, and of course Phillip Seymore Hoffman was AMAZING pulling off that character.
1394;But it was very good!
1395;The best part of the movie was Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance.
1396;He really got the sound of his voice correct.
1397;makes you feel its all connected some how.
1398;the past is illuminated by the present .
1399;Katherine Keener is funny, warm and cynical as Capote friend and then.
1400;The relationship between convicted murderer Perry Smith and Capote is complicated, sexually ambiguous, full of love and manipulation.
1401;"i had read for years how writing and experiencing ""In Cold Blood"" took a big toll on Capote, and this film helps bring that home."
1402;He wanted to help Perry Smith, but his helping prolonged the appeals process and being able to finish his book.
1403;He wants to finish his book but cannot until the killers are executed.
1404;He visits with Perry Smith's sister who tells Capote not to be fooled by Perry and his supposed sensitivity and sweetness.
1405;There is also a small clip of an interview with the real Truman Capote.
1406;"If you are on a march to view the majority of critically acclaimed movies of 2005, well your march will no doubt see you watching ""Capote,"" along the way."
1407;"Whereas, ""Walk the Line,"" draws you into the persona of Johnny Cash and gets you excited to learn more, director Bennet Miller's biopic falls short."
1408;"taking this criticism in stride, ""Capote,"" is very much a worthwhile movie to spend your time viewing."
1409;Capote is drawn in to the humanity of a rightfully convicted killer and finds himself shattered in the process.
1410;Tortured souls do create good art though.
1411;Capote is an excellent look into the writer's troubled self.
1412;obsession with status and the spotlight.
1413;But it's more than that, the lies.
1414;It's the having to live with the lies that is brilliantly conveyed to us through the Oscar.
1415;deserving performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
1416;Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a true star.
1417;If you like an artsy to whimsical film, this is for you, and have an open mind.
1418;I can watch this movie over and over and be amused every time.
1419;I really enjoyed this movie.
1420;hoffman was just great as Capote.
1421;excellent movie in every respect.
1422;Capote is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1423;But this film which follows him writing In Cold Blood was just very well done.
1424;From the actors to the director the scenes it is just magic.
1425;This is a fabulous introduction to Truman Capote and is a great supplement to the biography by Gerald Clarke that it is based on.
1426;Breathtaking cinematographic approaches, incredible screenwriting, and a stellar performance by Phillip Symour Hoffman lend to this incredible cinematic achievement.
1427;capote takes a unique approach at telling the story of eccentric American writer Truman Capote, while simultaneously retelling the horrifying story of the Kansas murders.
1428;This is a film that I as a movie.
1429;goer can only hope will stand in history as a land.
1430;I know that the lead actor won the Academy Award for this, but I thought he overacted the part.
1431;The movie itself was overall well put.
1432;This is an AMAZING movie and phenomenal acting!!!
1433;There is absolutely no one who could play that role better than him!
1434;at any rate, I finally did get around to watching it, and it really is as good as everyone said.
1435;When the movie begins, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's.
1436;he heads to the tiny town that has been turned upside down by the tragedy and quickly realizes that the raw material there will help him create the best book he's ever written.
1437;serving, and I think that's the way director Bennett Miller wanted it.
1438;In the end, Capote publishes one of the most revolutionary novels of the 20th century .
1439;Performances are wonderful, and the story will make you think.
1440;Philip Seymour Hoffman just blows audiences away with his stunning, Academy.
1441;winning portrayal of Capote (Truman Streckfus Persons) walks that delicate line of having sympathy for the character, while showing what a selfish man Capote was.
1442;Philip Seymour Hoffman won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his critically acclaimed portrayal of the title role.
1443;The movie is well done.
1444;But Hoffman was very true to the real Capote, and as the movie progressed, I believed Hoffman's performance completely.
1445;keener gives an understated performance as Harper Lee.
1446;She is at once Capote's companion, fellow author, admirer, and mother figure.
1447;Given that there are long periods in the film when Lee is not with Capote, Keener's ability to make Lee's influence on Capote felt is a credit to both Keener and Hoffman.
1448;collins, Jr. nearly steals the movie.
1449;His complex performance as Perry Smith hits every emotion perfectly.
1450;The chemistry between Collins, Jr. and Hoffman is spectacular.
1451;"capote's proximity to the subjects of his work challenges the ""nonfiction."
1452;Likewise, the viewer of this film perhaps comes away somewhat confused about the moral character of Capote, but this in no way detracts from the truths about Capote in this wonderful film.
1453;Hoffman definitely earned his Oscar with this production.
1454;Hoffman's Capote was indeed a complicated man and it seemed in truth that he sold his soul for the 'novel he was born to write.'
1455;It's truely a character study of a talented and intriguing man.
1456;In an age of movies that are loud, brash, violent and special FX laden I was so impressed to see a movie where I wanted to sit right up close to the TV to catch every word.
1457;this film does a great disservice to the readers of Truman Capote .
1458;"a fine writer, the author of such great American classics as ""Breakfast of Tiffanys', ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"", ""Grass Harp""."
1459;"ficiton novel' ""In Cold Blood"", developed a relationship with one of the two convicted killers he is writing about."
1460;It would seem that Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabited the character of Truman Capote and even though he looks and sounds nothing like him in real life, he does both in this movie in a way that is almost scary and thus the Oscar he won is well deserved.
1461;"The Bottom Line:Capote avoids the typical structure of a biopic and is all the better for it, eschewing formula to tell the story of one central episode in the main character's life
1462;Probably """"In Cold Blood"""" is a masterpiece, and if this movie is useful in some way is by prompting you to read that book."""
1463;He is one of a kind actor.
1464;Strange story, but interesting to watch if you don't know much about this writer.
1465;All these films share the same type of pre.
1466;existing story design, and all these films work and are very much worth watching.
1467;It is in this way that a true crime story can find its own originality, and seperate itself from other films in its genre.
1468;capote is no exception from this true crime formula, and director Bennett Miller does a fine job of keeping the vessel with in the confinds of these well groved tracks.
1469;wristed accent, and on top of all this, has a rather sizable desire to be the very social center of the entire universe.
1470;The juxtaposition of this extremely unusual one of a kind character to the salt of the Earth folks that are found in America's heart land, adds a nice bit of spice to this already intriguing dramatic stew.
1471;The film is full of fine performances, including the Oscar winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and as mentioned, Bennett Miller does a fine job of not letting the film stagger off track.
1472;i loved my red shoes.
1473;I can still remember how captivated I was with my bright red shoes.
1474;I bring up this early childhood memory to illustrate just where the major problem lies in this film.
1475;To me the notion to do this was a complete utter oxymoron, cinema, by definition, is a visual art form.
1476;The difference here is that despite these limitations, 12 Angry Men is visually appealing.
1477;The tone and shading to that picture registers as lush, rich, and delicious to the eye.
1478;capote, an all natural home remedy.
1479;i'll be perfectly honest with you, I own a copy of this film.
1480;capote over all is an great movie.
1481;Good story with a great cast and it's a true story.
1482;Her star rose as Truman's set.
1483;"the recent death of Phillip Seymour Hoffman galvanized me to see him in ""Capote"" and his portrayal of the iconic author is superb, from his physical appearance to his speech patterns to his gestures, You forget right away that you are listening to and watching an actor."
1484;Capote was in many ways a very strange man, and Hoffman grasps his personality, his very oddness, but you feel his genius hovering there beneath the surface of his often frivolous remarks.
1485;I really enjoy watching a biographical movie when the actor completely disappears within the character.
1486;His portrayal of Capote is not mincing or humorous, just real.
1487;the cast of capote, the cinematography, all of it a masterpiece even given the grim setting.
1488;I enjoyed watching this movie and the brilliant lead role of Truman Capote played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
1489;It was well done, but definately wasnt one of the best of the year.
1490;Wonderful movie, with inspired performances by all.
1491;Excellent commentary as an extra feature.
1492;"A film about a gay man it never made fun or satire the ""straight"" world of the 1950's."
1493;the makers of this film are fair not only to the main character well played by Hoffmann showing his strengths and flaws as a human being but also to the many straight characters.
1494;the movie is a rare example of Hollywood getting it right i. e. a well.
1495;made, honest film, with a plot and a point.
1496;Truman Capote was a successful writer living in New York, who at age 23 had achieved notoriety with his first book, called Other Voices, Other Rooms and was enjoying greater critical acclaim for a breezy romantic novella he had recently completed titled Breakfast at Tiffany's.
1497;capote brilliantly tells the tale of how a gifted artist followed his instincts, hopped on a train to travel to America's heartland and painstakingly assembled the narrative details of this infamous evening, by psychologically dissecting the mind of a killer.
1498;The film is a straightforward account of how this seemingly demure man used his disarming wit and superior skills of manipulation to collect the information required to fashion his masterpiece In Cold Blood.
1499;And though there is much debate over how he didn't use notes while compiling his research (a detail the movie explains by demonstrating Capote's astonishingly accurate sense of recall), it is certain he created a chilling depiction of the Clutter family massacre.
1500;"It takes every measure of Truman's moral courage to meet with Hickcock and Smith
1501;The film gives you an intimate look at how such a gifted novelist invested so much in one project, to the point where he never had the desire to complete another one.
1502;though released in late September, Capote is once again making the rounds at your local movie theatre, as it will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1503;Though all the acting is uniformly excellent, Hoffman's performance as the flamboyant Capote is masterwork of a journeyman performer.
1504;He is your guide in telling the story within the story.
1505;In a somewhat spotty year for meaty plot lines, this is a motion picture that offers a glimpse at one of the most interesting dramas ever told.
1506;his roommate is also a successful writer, but what is the dynamic?
1507;hoffmans' performance as Truman Capote is Oscar.
1508;worthy, though perhaps too studied and imitative.
1509;Clifton Collins, who portrayed Perry Smith, one of the killers, did a remarkable job which I thought was more noteworthy than Hoffman's efforts.
1510;Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists.
1511;Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehended are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re.
1512;this movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best.
1513;selling and important work, In Cold Blood.
1514;the result is very affecting.
1515;Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.
1516;The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles.
1517;and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize.
1518;Two worlds exist in this country: the quiet conservative life, and and the life of those two men .
1519;A masterful performance that all but takes this film and turns it into a study of a writer and his behavior, and how he comes to write the novel of his life.
1520;The director, Bennett Miller, has also taken this chance to fully realize his life's work and has put together the film of his lifetime.
1521;Together this is the best film of last year.
1522;The result is a fascinating read """"In Cold Blood"""" And, as the film progresses we come to understand that the title of the film not only portrays the horrific killing, but the behavior of the author in obtaining the """"real story""""."""
1523;Insight into Capote's mind is a satisfying look, but also a feeling of looking into the mind of a damaged soul.
1524;"foot.10, effortlessly captures the diminutive Capote without ever calling attention to his height."""
1525;capote has a childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) .
1526;Catherine Keener provides a warm and human side to this film.
1527;chris Cooper plays the, Kansas investigator Alvin Dewey, and his portrayal is brilliant.
1528;This film is dark and somber most of the time, but it shines in the performances.
1529;A vivid portrayal of four horrific murders, the telling of the story, the writing of the book and the selling of Capote's soul to obtain the story of his lifetime.
1530;edge of the seat action.
1531;i would see it again, for sure.
1532;This is a very well acted movie but such a tragic story all the way around.
1533;I cannot recommend the acting more and the angle of the story is fascinating.
1534;The acting, story line and filming were excellent.
1535;A lot has already been written about how fantastic this movie is and how wonderful Phillip Seymour Hoffman is as Truman Capote.
1536;Watching this movie, you cannot even tell that the actor is PSH as he is so convincing as Capote.
1537;you know what happens but it's the journey that is told so well in this movie.
1538;Philip Seymour Hoffman gives an award winning performance along with a great supporting cast.
1539;the story offers insight about the writing of Capote's greatest work.
1540;Capote is the tale of a writer who acheived his greatest work at the cost of his own soul, while also being a tale that takes 2 wasted hours to tell it.
1541;"This chronicle of Truman Capote's research and creation of ""In Cold Blood"", his greatest and last novel, is similar to its title character in many ways."
1542;The way that this man could say the most hurtful things to another human being, while lying to them at the same time, is really interesting to watch.
1543;I wouldn't have picked Hoffman to win the Oscar, but he has definitely given the best performance of his career!What made this movie work so ineffectively for me was the pacing.
1544;"The movie isn't all over the place with its plot or unfocused
1545;Hoffman brilliantly portrays an author who descends into depression and self.
1546;Come to think of it, """"Capote"""" finally has some life breathed into during the last half."""
1547;"I enjoyed that much more than ""Capote""."
1548;One movie about one subject is enough.
1549;The acting is jaw dropping.
1550;You'll thank me once you view it.
1551;This movie is emotionally intense at times, but other than that I did not find it unique.
1552;Philip Seymore Hoffman's performance is what is worth watching.
1553;his physically transformation and the way he affects Truman Capote's mannerisms is astounding.
1554;While the story of Capote's selfish befriending of all the friends of the victims was rather crass, PSH's depiction of him was haunting and well deserving of the Oscar he won for it.
1555;It was interesting to get some insight into her life, however fictional it may have been.
1556;Philip Seymour Hoffman did an amazing acting job in this movie.
1557;"Phillip Seymour Hoffman rightfully got the lion's share of attention for the film ""Capote,""."
1558;it's truly one of those transformative performances.
1559;but it's the sum of its wonderful parts that made this movie much more than a star vehicle.
1560;All of the performances are outstanding, as is the design, cinematography and script.
1561;and it's rare these days to see such mature, nuanced and intelligent filmmaking.
1562;And one can certainly believe the premise.
1563;like a cat playing with the mouse he will eventually devour.
1564;I love this movie it is history and gore with the murders.
1565;This movie is enthralling .
1566;I even ordered the book because the movie is so good.
1567;It's become de rigeuer to paint the killers, especially Perry Smith, sympathetically, and this Prime Directive is followed here, though the focus is on Capote's unraveling.
1568;the film is masterfully made on every level, and the problem is that you are always aware of it.
1569;Adam Kimmel's cinematography is like a series of exquisite photographs in an autumnal palette of gold, yellow, rust, and black.
1570;Dan Futterman's screenplay is brilliant, witty, and so controlled it's almost anal.
1571;The acting is subtle and superb down to each individual prison guard.
1572;Speaking of Catherine Keener I got a kick out of seeing that Harper Lee was a cigarette.
1573;sometimes just a reaction beat.
1574;four minutes to a crisp 95 minutes without sacrificing any of the mood.
1575;"this is a ""fine"" film (much too self."
1576;This film has got to be the best movie I've seen this year.
1577;The acting was flawless, the ambiance and the cinematography were just perfect, and I felt like I was there with the characters.
1578;Phillip Seymour Hoffman MUST win the Oscar for his brilliant performance in this film.
1579;Everything I've read or heard about this film proved true.
1580;It is a fascinating look at Truman Capote's obsessive pursuit of the story of 2 drifters/murderers that he helped to make immortal with his book In Cold Blood.
1581;philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Capote and he is already being hyped as the Oscar winner for his performance.
1582;She gives a very understated and yet satifying performance.
1583;nevertheless this is well worth seeing.
1584;'Capote' captures the peculiar creative process involved in the author's breakthrough literary piece, one that costs him his psychic and physical well.
1585;First and foremost, this film is anchored by the brilliant performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
1586;I know many others have said the same thing, but this performance MUST get an Oscar nomination.
1587;This is a riveting, intelligent movie.
1588;but would be completely sunk without a great performance.
1589;hoffman makes him as real and believable as such a person could be.
1590;But he's first drawn in by the crimes and a fascination with the brutality.
1591;He wins the reluctant trust of the head law enforcement official (Chris Cooper) and the story begins to take shape.
1592;He finagles a meeting with King and discovers a soft.
1593;spoken, highly intelligent soul, in some ways a kindred spirit.
1594;priced legal help for the men, just to draw out the process.
1595;Naturally, King is grateful for the friendship.
1596;The movie has it both ways.
1597;Hoffman is compelled again and again to depict a man who doesn't clearly know his own heart.
1598;Hoffman handles these challenges brilliantly.
1599;another key role (an another Oscar nomination, one can hope) is the character of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD author Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, one of the best actresses around.
1600;"At first, she is simply his lifelong friend and now his ""research assistant."""
1601;It's an unattractive side to him, and there is a brief but lovely scene when Lee recognizes how torn up Capote is, and instead of confronting her old friend (and believe me, she isn't one to necessarily spare his feelings), she offers a brief moment of comfort.
1602;We don't feel bad that the men are sentenced to die, but the quietness of the scenes is very effective.
1603;Yes, executions make almost naturally compelling drama, but the filmmakers have gone above and beyond.
1604;The young actor Clifton Collins Jr, who plays Perry, does a terrific job throughout, but he shines in these scenes.
1605;I highly recommend this film.
1606;Overall I really liked it and would recommend it to others.
1607;It also was informative especially if you are interested in authors.
1608;It is remarkable that two movies about Truman Capote and both dealing with the same subtext .
1609;Capote, released in 2005, is the better.
1610;known film with Philip Seymour Hoffman justifiably winning an Oscar as best actor.
1611;"But ""Infamous"" (2006) is just as compelling and dare I say it, Toby Jones is just as good as Hoffman in the title role ."
1612;Just as important are the supporting roles in both films.
1613;are equally good as are the two Perry Smiths .
1614;"On the other hand, ""Capote"" has the always superb Chris Cooper in a critical supporting role."
1615;Again as good as Hopkins is as Hannibal.
1616;Phillip Seymour Hoffman captures precisely the speech and mannerisms of Truman Capote.
1617;The other characters are well played too.
1618;Somerset Maugham liked to characterize himself as a good writer of the second rank.
1619;This marvelous film tells the story of the writing of that book and reiterates the theory of one of Capote's most prominent biographers that the writing of that book was not merely the culmination of his career, but the cause of his decline as a writer and his descent into alcoholism.
1620;The past few years has seen an explosion of biopics, but by any standard this has to stand as one of the very finest, and perhaps even the best.
1621;Almost every year going into Oscar season we see at least one performance that so completely overwhelms all of the others it seems inconceivable that that performance will not win the Oscar.
1622;What is astonishing is not merely that Hoffman did such a magnificent job of imitating Capote's voice and mannerisms that he seems to be channeling rather than impersonating him but that within that imitation he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range.
1623;this film, which has been widely reported as having been shot in slightly more than a month, is remarkable on almost every level.
1624;The period look is impeccable from the dress to the d cor of rooms.
1625;Every aspect of the production is first rate, but what really shines is the superb cast, which is populated with a host of great character actors.
1626;Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener (a great beauty who glams down in this one as Capote's close friend Harper Lee.
1627;showing that she is going in middle age going to be one of our most versatile actresses), Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy), Bob Balaban, and Mark Pellegrino all perform marvelously in a very strong cast.
1628;During the proceedings Capote, who was covering the murders for the New Yorker, befriended Smith, who has a background similar to Capote's own.
1629;The film is superb at showing the complexity of human motivation, how Capote both truly likes Smith and yet exploits him shamelessly while also being repulsed by him.
1630;blooded manner in which Capote both exhibits tremendous compassion for Smith and lies to him about the state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.
1631;A mark of how good the movie is comes when how tortured Capote is shown to be by his exploitation of Smith.
1632;The story from beginning to end is both riveting and horrifying.
1633;This truly is one of the most marvelously written books in the past half century.
1634;IN COLD BLOOD is one of the finest American books of the past century and this fine film will hopefully be watched in conjunction with it in the future.
1635;I will close by adding that while IN COLD BLOOD was made into a superb film (starring Robert Blake as Perry Smith), I think CAPOTE is an even better film.
1636;This riveting performance captures the internal conflict that was likely instrumental in defining Truman Capote's latter life.
1637;I thought it was an excellent movie, especially after watching IN COLD BLOOD.
1638;CAPOTE also offers insight into Capote's career and the demise of his career.
1639;Hoffman did a great job portraying Capote .
1640;A very good movie from my stand point.
1641;likes true story enough said.
1642;i would recommend this movie to anyone.
1643;Phillip Seymour Hoffman's best work.
1644;His passing has left us bereft of a great talent.
1645;He captures what most of us knew of Capote's personality, and includes the star.
1646;Most eloquent in his silences, Hoffman mesmerizes us with his performance.
1647;"Capote, a successful writer and bon vivant of the literati set in Manhattan, found himself drawn to the case, venturing to the heart of the country with his lifelong friend, Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), to interview the accused killers and try to make some sense of the whole thing."
1648;"like precision on the complex relationship that develops between Capote and Perry, the more ""sensitive"" of the two killers."
1649;Capote is drawn to this man in so powerful a fashion that even he is unable to figure out exactly why.
1650;And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity.
1651;clifton Collins Jr. is also very powerful as Perry, providing the sensitivity and charisma the character needs to make the story convincing.
1652;In a rich performance as Harper Lee, Catherine Keener serves as the moral center of gravity to which Capote must continually return in order to finish his work and maintain his grip on reality.
1653;documentary film, Bennett Miller demonstrates remarkable control as a director.
1654;His spare filmmaking style perfectly reflects not only the harsh Midwest setting but the chamber.
1655;"It is a very ""interior"" film, and Miller is not afraid to linger long on his scenes, allowing the actors free rein in establishing their rhythms and building the drama."
1656;To others it may be good.
1657;It was a fair movie, not great as I had expected.
1658;Yes, great scenery showing a sweeping, isolating emptiness up to the Clutter door.
1659;another jarring anachronism threads its way through the film.
1660;On the one hand, he liked them (especially Perry Smith).
1661;He could have finished his book, brought it to some meaningful resolution, without an actual execution.
1662;And that's the sort of tragic conflict that affects so many of us.
1663;"so while I recommend ""Capote,"" still, it left me longing for something more."
1664;Capote is an excellent movie and clearly depicts Truman as the complete eccentric that he was.
1665;Some would argue, and I'm one of them, that this is the most sensitive film portrayal of a character by the late Phil Hoffman of them all.
1666;I'm old enough to remember what a fascinating oddity Capote was when he appeared so much on TV in the middle of the twentieth century.
1667;He came across as brilliant, articulate, effeminate, and bitchy.
1668;this film contains a great deal of stillness.
1669;At a time when so many films are hacked by the film editor into confetti, this film takes its own sweet time in conveying every scene.
1670;Because of that, apprehension and suspense always seem to be present.
1671;The film is far more compelling because it was not made in color.
1672;The commentaries are extremely fine as well.
1673;Good Movie worth the time to watch, easy plot to follow, good movie theme, nice way to spend an afternoon,
1674;Cuz Philip Seymour Hoffman was is and always will be remembered as being one of the greatest artists of all time.
1675;He was a master at telling the truth through someone else's eyes, and in the end, it was his own truth that killed him.
1676;I indeed was mesmerized throughout this film, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was brilliant.
1677;It held my interest, keep me captivated, and was fascinating to me.
1678;The woman that played his assistant, was very very good.
1679;"I found it equally fascinating that she wrote the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird."""
1680;his humor, his mannerisms, his lies to get the story .
1681;I loved how his assistant had him so pegged.
1682;That alone was very funny.
1683;What decorum she had!Educational, interesting.
1684;Whether gently charming his way into Sherrif Dewey's house [Chris Cooper, great in a low.
1685;key part], petulantly attending Harper Lee's [Catherine Keener, another terrific re.
1686;creation of both the man and the role as played by Robert Blake], who .
1687;becomes the nonfiction write's darling w/his .
1688;It has inspired me to read and see In Cold Blood again.
1689;It is a straight, fierce double shot of grain liquor.
1690;fiction and the treadmill for the true.
1691;Director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman don't rehash the book .
1692;Richard Brooks' 1967 film does that fine.
1693;Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Capote, covers the journey as if he was born to it, effortlessly channeling the man's charm, malice and tunnel ambition, not to mention his speech and mannerisms.
1694;in his New York fishbowl Capote holds court.
1695;In these scenes Capote is his usual storytelling self on a four or five, and he is very good at working over regular folks with stories of Bogart and Marilyn.
1696;He changes the day Smith and Hickok are captured and he meets Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in the kitchen of the sheriff's apartment, in the women's holding cell.
1697;By the hour of their execution in a warehouse behind Leavenworth prison, Capote has slipped into a basket of acute alcoholism, self.
1698;The fact of his book and the lives of those in it reverse prioritiesThe movie has an elegant, unhurried construction toward the moment Capote sees his subjects for the last time just before midnight.
1699;hoffman's dandy aside, the performances suit the tone.
1700;"Keener's Harper Lee is steady, sage and close to saintly
1701;The way Capote was able to get into the heads of the killers and bring them to life was astounding.
1702;He was an amazing author.
1703;the movie was done so well and the acting was absolutely exceptional.
1704;It gave me great insight into Capote and sadly explained his relationship with the killers and it's effect on his life.
1705;i highly recommend this movie to anyone.
1706;Nevertheless, it was fascinating to watch dear Phillip Seymour Hoffman at his best.
1707;The life of Truman Capote is amazingly portrayed with accuracy by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1708;He wraps Capote's essence in a well.
1709;packaged gift for the audience.
1710;The genius of In Cold Blood boosted Capote to infinite fame, but at a price.
1711;An eccentric man with an electric presence is surrounded by celebrities, but maintains individuality that stands out to this day.
1712;The film grabs an important piece of Capote's career and magnifies it for the viewer.
1713;He was almost always surprisingly good in surprisingly enjoyable films, and his name appearing a few names below the stars' in the cast was almost a validation that the movie was worth your time.
1714;but with """"Capote,"""" Hoffman cast aside whatever """"marginal"""" status he may have had and has given one of the best on."""
1715;screen performances in recent years.
1716;This is a performance for the ages .
1717;Capote keeps its focus on Truman, which is probably appropriate for an ego.
1718;"The only quibble I have is that virtually every supporting character in ""Capote"" is entirely static . . . some very talented actors are not given a second note to play, but are solid in their one."
1719;"the movie also captures the torment writing ""In Cold Blood"" put Capote through, a uniquely Capote."
1720;When Smith and Hickock are sentenced to death, Capote knows that he has an ending to his book.
1721;Virtually everyone around him sees this corruption of Capote's soul, but this master of insight can't see it in himself.
1722;a wonderful performance in a very good movie, Hoffman has likely done for Capote what George C. Scott did for General Patton .
1723;awaited film based on the biography of one of the best American authors to ever have lived.
1724;Sometimes a secured Oscar is enjoyed more than a barnburner.
1725;if you have, or haven't, seen Capote then please read some of his masterpieces.
1726;In Cold Blood is probably one of the best Non.
1727;Truman Capote led a very interesting life that is worth much attention and study.
1728;This is a film that must be seen and admired by many.
1729;I loved the Capote experience.
1730;I would definitely add this movie to my top twenty list.
1731;Stunning portrayal of Capote by Hoffman!
1732;Interesting story about the writing of In Cold Blood.
1733;His relationship with the killers, particularly Perry Smith has an element of mystery.
1734;good performances by all the supporting actors.
1735;All in all a ver memorable sMovie .
1736;Well I'm glad I got to see it.
1737;This is an absolute tour de force by Hoffman.
1738;The movie itself is as good as Hoffman's performance, Keener does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend Harper Lee, she is his sounding board.
1739;Hoffman's is such a nuanced performance and it is so interesting to watch Capote get eaten up by his own ambition, you can see in Hoffman's face a man who knows deep down what an empty vessel he is, all he wants is fame and he will stoop to any level to receive it.
1740;The scene at the end where Capote tearfully tells the killers as they are about to go to their death that he did all he could to save them, it is so sincere, yet at the same time sooo insincere, he's such a manipulator, I think even Capote believes it for a minute.
1741;I highly recommend this film, it's a career performance by Hoffman, you'll be blown away.
1742;hoffman definitely deserved the Oscar for his adaption of Capote which was brilliant.
1743;This movie does a great job of capturing that feeling in the end, but could have used a bit more of it when Capote first met the killers.
1744;otherwise, this movie is enduring magnificence to the saga that is Capote!
1745;"for people truly interested in Capote, ""Infamous"" does a sharper and more eloquent job of infusing the kind of joie de vivre for which Truman Capote is known."
1746;The script is strewn with just the kind of jaunty wit that was his hallmark.
1747;"taken on its own, I am sure ""Capote"" is quite a film, but ""Infamous"" towers over its award."
1748;"Its breadth of emotion is all the more staggering for the depth it achieves
1749;Go for the laughs and stay for the tears and come away with a sense of what is human and what is kind.
1750;Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, while entirely displaying his mannerisms and enveloping his persona, Truman Capote to the screen.
1751;He feels that he is a very misunderstood man.
1752;I could see it physically and psychologically draining and turning around for Truman Capote.
1753;up by Smith's words, the overtly gruesome murder scenes, the open detailed dialogue concerning it, and the funeral scenes.
1754;Truman Capote is repelled as much as he is drawn in by, what he believes is, a vulnerable Perry Smith.
1755;They start a kind of cat and mouse type game between them.
1756;This is what this intelligent and articulate man is capable of, and on a whim?
1757;Therein lies the dichotomy of this once spirited, open man and writer, Truman, who turns completely into a tapped.
1758;Director Bennett Miller paints a frightening picture and an even steadier decline of his subject.
1759;My heart lurches with each movie I see when I view the dedication he brought to each and every role he portrayed.
1760;Very good movie with excellent cast!
1761;Interesting perspective when considering a writer's view of life and death.
1762;The book is absolutely brilliant and unbiased.
1763;With great empathy and attention to detail, Capote describes the brutal murders of four members of the Clutter family in Kansas.
1764;He devotes equal attention to Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, The two men who eventually confessed to killing the Clutter family.
1765;indeed, Capote spent six years of his life working on this masterpiece and it was one of the best books that I've ever read.
1766;He clearly cared about all the characters involved, not just Perry Smith, with whom he identified and formed a strong bond.
1767;having said that, Hoffman's acting job was brilliant and the movie certainly had some merits, but it dragged towards the end and was imminently predictable.
1768;Mid 1950s and Truman Capote was a well known writer in high society New York following the success of his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.
1769;After that, as is well documented, a sighting of a small article in the New York times about a sinister, rural murder in a remote Kansas town led to bizzarre, captivating and emotionally tortuous events that created a masterpiece and ultimately broke the writer.
1770;This superlative movie tells that story.
1771;capote, a man with a fragile ego and a gregarious desire to be entertaining, and be loved, travels to Kansas with his erstwhile friend Harper Lee (soon to have her own literary success with 'To Kill a Mockingbird).
1772;a completely new genre, the non.
1773;Capote develops a great bond and affinity with Smith, but knows that to publish his masterpiece, he must be executed.
1774;As the film develops, the ego and talent .
1775;both genius and monstrous .
1776;He dangles the promise of further legal help to Smith so he can continue writing the story, but knows all along that this will be ultimately relinquished.
1777;the masterpiece gets written, but the price was paid.
1778;that rarity, a great artist and a full scale personality.
1779;An outstanding portrayal of Truman Capote by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
1780;The film also looks at his friendship with Harper Lee and how they supported one another's literary careers.
1781;Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves every accolade he received for this film and his performance is spell binding, you are truly riveted by his every look and inflection.
1782;pics go this one is outstanding.
1783;If you've read `In Cold Blood' then this makes for interesting and relevant viewing and if not then I highly recommend you do so, it is an incredible piece of writing and puts this film in greater context.
1784;A film that is deserving of all it's praise and well worth a look.
1785;I found Hoffman's (whom I persosnally think is a great actor) portrayal of Capote touching and graphic, and Harper Lee's character was wonderful.
1786;i saw referrence to Infamous,and some feel that movie is better"
1787;I read ICB when I was a kid, the movie, and now will finish with Infamous.
1788;"i recommend Capote to anyone who saw or read In Cold Blood
1789;The film's structure is a bit perplexing"
1790;This period certainly yields a lot of interesting material, yet I feel that those who have not read Clarke's biography may feel a little lost as there is very little context included.
1791;"The most awesome facet of the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's incredible impersonation of Capote
1792;the film is very engaging and often disturbing.
1793;Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet.
1794;As someone who read In Cold Blood, it was fascinating to see a representation of how Capote and the killers influenced each other during his research and interviews.
1795;PSH is an amazing actor.
1796;Truman Capote was one of America's finest authors in his day.
1797;All the while Truman is writing his masterpiece on their undead bodies.
1798;The rest of the cast were excellent.
1799;Pity the film had so much going for it and was so easily defeated by editing of script and film, but with a film dealing with such deep issues framed with such a simple rung of events, every shot, every word, every creative choice has to be close to perfect for the film to thrive.
1800;It's still a great film, but definitely not for a matinee audience, and can only be enjoyed by the older, artsier, or more intellectual crowd.
1801;It seems to me that has of lately, actors that win the best actor award for the year, get it because of inimating people.
1802;There is also a lead investigator (Chris Cooper) and his wife (Amy Ryan).
1803;And even has Christmas sinner with them, when he gets a call that they got the 2 men they suspect that has to do with the killings.
1804;deserved Oscar went to Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his wonderfully understated performance which in the hands of a lesser actor could easily have been reduced to a superficial, stereotypical, self.
1805;it's hard to say I """"enjoyed"""" this film as it is very slow and deals with disturbing issues, but I highly recommend this film to be seen at least once."""
1806;"I love the scene where the overtly feminine Capote, complete with ""flasher."
1807;It's a pricelessly funny moment in an otherwise dark and disturbing film.
1808;fYI: For those of you who love trivia, Harper Lee included her childhood friend Capote in her novel as the character Dill, the young friend who spends every summer with the Finches.
1809;Her close friend Forest Whitaker, 2007 Best Actor Oscar winner forThe Last King of Scotlandand director of her independent filmHope Floatsmay direct (and he could play Tom Robinson).
1810;I think Tom Hanks would make a great Atticus Finch as he is a tremendous talent and we all know Hanks could put on a wonderfully realistic southern accent (Forrest Gump).
1811;"There's one line in the movie in which Capote says, ""This book will change how I see the world, how everyone will see the world."""
1812;The cinematography and acting are both topnotch.
1813;This great film does a wonderful job of portraying one of the great literary minds of recent times, Mr. Truman Capote.
1814;It tells the story of how he came to research and write his classic, _In Cold Blood_.
1815;A brilliant pyschological drama of the haunted loner so often associated with creativity.
1816;Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the movie are about Capote's manipulativeness and how people still sort of love him for it.
1817;"The relationship with childhood friend Harper Lee is also interesting
1818;I came to this picture late, but it was well worth the trip.
1819;Philip Seymour Hoffman is totally convincing, the tale is bewitching and tragic, and it is an unusual cinematic addition to the In Cold Blood drama.
1820;As a movie, it is superb.
1821;maker's insights into Capote's psyche as HE gains insights into the two murderer's own psyches is fascinating.
1822;Really good cinema on every level.
1823;Philip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding.
1824;He brought the character to life and his talent will be sorely missed.
1825;Then story was gripping and the acting was terrific.
1826;Interesting to see the process he used to write his book.
1827;What a great movie, outstanding acting, it was amazing to watch it.
1828;This is a must see movie for anyone!
1829;I got this movie to earn about Mr. Capote, and also to enjoy the story.
1830;It was an extremely well done movie and I was very pleasedwith the story.
1831;Well shot and some good performances and gives an interesting portrait of the true story of Capote and his involvement in writing In Cold Blood.
1832;I'd give 4.5 stars, but rounded to 5 because Philip Seymour Hoffman was so good.
1833;A very engaging and thought provoking movie.
1834;WSH portrayal of capote was excellent .
1835;Excellent movie from one of the best!
1836;I just watched this for the second time in honor of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
1837;No wonder he won an Academy Award for his role.
1838;Kept us entertained through out the whole movie.
1839;Capote is the story of an American legend.
1840;Anyone that has every taken a creative writing course knows the way it goes.
1841;This film adds details, depth, and dialogue to the classic story behind a classic story.
1842;In the middle of it all: A love story.
1843;A very historically interesting and literally inspiring movie.
1844;Phillip Seymour Hoffman does an outstanding job playing Truman Capote.
1845;This performance is certainly in a league of its own.
1846;Capote tackles an extremely eccentric storyline with tact, thoughtfulness, intelligence, and style.
1847;I laughed at Truman Capote's very funny cameo in Neil Simon's comedy, MURDER BY DEATH, and always liked Rich Little's impersonations of him back then.
1848;Hoffman does so much more than just mimic Capote (he does the voice awesome, though!)
1849;He completely fleshes out the unseen narrator of the novel, becoming a fascinating character himself.
1850;but you can see how far Capote was willing to go to get his story, and the toll it took on the rest of his life.
1851;the extras are also interesting.
1852;that was his voice!The entire cast is great, from Catherine Kenner to Chris Cooper to all the Winnipeg locals the filmmakers used in crowd scenes.
1853;Beautifully photographed with Canada standing in for Kansas, CAPOTE is a wonderful film about a dark crime and a great literary event.
1854;PSH is great, but it takes more than a great actor to make a great film.
1855;I can see why Phillip Seymour Hoffman (may he RIP) got an Oscar for his performance!
1856;Seymour Hoffman was a gifted actor, and his death is a great loss to us all.
1857;You worry about doing the film justice, giving the film its due, convincing other that this film is worthy.
1858;Capote is a great film.
1859;Something about the article speaks to Capote, he can write about this and turn it into a great article for the New Yorker.
1860;Dewey's wife invites Capote and Lee to dinner, thrilled to have a celebrity in the house, beginning a friendship with the Dewey's which leads to them sharing Christmas dinner.
1861;Capote, directed by Bennett Miller, written by Dan Futterman and produced by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, among others, is a great film.
1862;the most amazing thing about the film is Hoffman's portrayal of Capote.
1863;The film, and Hoffman, quickly establish Capote's character.
1864;Enjoying success as a writer, and celebrity, he holds court during a party, recounting the story of another author telling him about his new book.
1865;This scene quickly establishes Capote's ego and his love of attention.
1866;He wants to be a great writer"
1867;But the truly great thing about this performance is the relationship between Capote and Smith.
1868;Hoffman brings these to life, in a completely disarming way.
1869;capote had a very stylized speech pattern and Hoffman captures it without stereotyping it or making light of it.
1870;as far as I am concerned, the Oscar race for Best Actor is over.
1871;There may be other very good performances to come, but I doubt there will be another performance as good as Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote.
1872;all of the supporting performances are pitch perfect.
1873;Catherine Keener, once again, does a great job as she brings author Nelle Harper Lee to life.
1874;She and Capote had Southern roots and the desire to be great writers in common.
1875;Capote clearly liked to surround himself with talent, as friends and associates, and he recognized that Lee would be a great writer as well.
1876;"Over the course of writing ""In Cold Blood"", Lee's novel is published to great acclaim and made into a film starring Gregory Peck."
1877;chris Cooper is outstanding as the tortured lawman.
1878;At one point, Capote helps Smith and Hickock find new lawyers.
1879;clifton Collins, Jr. is also mesmerizing as Perry Smith.
1880;Collins manages to subtly convey that Smith may be just as manipulative as his new friend, Capote.
1881;He realizes early on that Capote needs him and once he gives Capote what he wants his new `friend' is gone.
1882;Throughout their relationship, they play a subtle game of cat and mouse.
1883;the beauty of the film is that it puts us in Capote's shoes.
1884;We experience all of the emotions that he experiences, see everything that he sees, and witness the events that he is present for.
1885;When he hears Smith's recount of the murders, he is visibly shaken, as are we, by the power of the words and images used.
1886;"rightfully, the film concentrates on Capote's life during the research and writing of ""In Cold Blood""."
1887;It was essentially, the book he was meant to write and it would end his creative career.
1888;Capote does that rare thing.
1889;You learn about the man, his talent, and his life.
1890;Capote is a movie based on the life of Truman Capote and his personal journey in researching a story for his New Yorker magazine.
1891;fiction novel, bring about a new approach to the face of journalism.
1892;Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the part of Capote and did a remarkable job of capturing all the distinct physical characteristics of Capote that made him a well.
1893;The organizers of the book picked the title and my job was to amuse the crowd.
1894;one aspect of the movie is that, it concentrates more on the strong relationship Capote built with one of the murderers and the effect it had on his life, making this book the last of his novellas.
1895;dan Futterman and Bennett Miller did an astounding job of answering the question as to why the movies was titled Capote, because most of the screen time and camera is well spent on Hoffman who did an astonishing job of not only playing Capote but becoming Truman Capote.
1896;the screen colors are dark in tone, which works well with the mood and settings of the movie as it is told in anticipation holding audiences to the end of their seats.
1897;the screen play is well written and the movie is well directed making it a unique work of art.
1898;that is the true focus of the picture.
1899;You see him charm a small town of Kansas citizens into giving him the story and, as he gets deeper and deeper into the minds of the killers, lose his soul.
1900;is actually becoming a monster that has swallowed his whole.
1901;"It is in that realm that ""Capote"" transcends mere biography and ends as great cinema."
1902;Very interesting look at Truman Capote the man and his great work.
1903;"This is a brilliant performance
1904;One of the most brilliant writers of his generation, Capote managed to squander his talent in an orgy of booze, drugs and self.
1905;the supporting cast is uniformely superb.
1906;As is the script, the art direction (you'll want to take screen.
1907;A well made film, if perhaps oversimplified in its plot and unexciting in its direction"
1908;Within the first several minutes of Capote, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the title character reveals itself as phenomenal, the complete transformation in character that most actors could only dream of.
1909;Every solitary word, movement, and gesture is flawless, engrossing in ways equal to the best work of Brando, Di Niro, Olivier, and Penn.
1910;He was a brilliant writer and man in general, with no qualms about gleefully showing his genius off.
1911;Early in the film we see him as the center of attention at a hip New York party, but minutes later he pays a bellhop to rave about his works in front of a pre.
1912;His ability to recall 94% of what he reads comes in handy for both interviews as well as impressing the citizenry.
1913;When the murderers are apprehended, he nearly jumps for joy, seeing an opportunity to write an amazing book, a `non.
1914;wrenching, and brilliant, Capote deserves recognition as an instant classic.
1915;Masterfully crafted on every level and with physically palatable power, it epitomizes why the movies are the most poignant and relevant art form today.
1916;Feel of the film was unique.
1917;He was far more interesting than I'd imagined, and very human on the one hand, and ruthless on the other hand, and his conscience suffered heavily for his profession.
1918;this writer is also a great conversationalist, who can easily obtain the trust of Sheriff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and even Perry himself.
1919;It is amazing to see his art of conversation, or I should say, his monologue because after all Capote does not take no for answer, and whatever he says, the listeners would listen anyway.
1920;A mesmerizing performance by Hoffman.
1921;As a kid I remember seeing Capote on Johnny Carson and thinking that he was the strangest human I had ever seen.
1922;Hoffman is stunning as Capote.
1923;With tense dialogue and compelling performances, the film portrays Capote's inner conflict between compassion for his subjects and intense literary ambition, which ultimately paved the way for the author's psychological unraveling.
1924;As the story blossoms into a novel, Capote develops a friendship with one of the killers, the troubled Perry Smith.
1925;During his interviews with Smith, Capote genuinely empathizes and identifies with the young man, who endured a similarly lonely, traumatic childhood.
1926;phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a truly brilliant performance, expertly capturing Capote's distinctive voice and mannerisms as well as the nuances of the writer's inner turmoil.
1927;"Catherine Keener fits well the role of Harper Lee, whose friendship with Capote provides a voice of conscience and creates some of the film's humorous moments (after a porter raves about Capote's work, Lee turns to him and says knowingly, ""You paid him to say that."""
1928;Without being over the top, his performance is amazing.
1929;Amazing true story of the book In Cold Blood .
1930;The character acting was spot on.
1931;We see the author at his best time ,when writing was truly his game.
1932;So it was very informative.
1933;of course there is Philip Hoffman's portrayal, which is worth the price of admission.
1934;After seeing this movie, I may.
1935;It is a worthwhile film.
1936;Another new film with classic overtones.
1937;Not just excellent acting by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Catherine Keener, but incredible costumes and hair, which transport you back to the 1960s.
1938;Both attempted to cover Truman's preparations for the writing of his hugely successful 'factual' novel 'In Cold Blood'.
1939;Comparisons between the two neatly highlight their strengths and weaknesses and this review may help to indicate which type of Capote 'reader' you are.
1940;Most of his contemporaries described him as extrovert but stylish.
1941;star cast in 'Infamous' is actually something of a distraction.
1942;As the film progresses these little bits of duff casting jolt the viewer back to realising they're just watching a film.
1943;the film 'Capote' however, has just the one big name and he won an Oscar for his performance.
1944;He clearly read an awful lot about Truman and the depth he lends to this performance is both chilling and moving.
1945;He understands Capote's razor sharp social skills and the methods he used to get what he wanted.
1946;This is a T. c. you can believe in.
1947;catherine Keener makes a truly fine Harper Lee and her relationship with Seymour's Capote is spot on.
1948;Theirs is a true friendship, warts and all and unlike Sandra Bullock, Keener doesn't wear a silly wig.
1949;there's also a superb choice for the role of Perry Smith.
1950;Clifton Collins Jr turns in a brilliant performance and as this film centres on the relationship between Truman and Smith, his part in the film is absolutely crucial.
1951;the look of 'Capote' is similarly classy.
1952;while 'Capote' reaches its 'impact moments' through sheer strength of acting and a fine script, 'Infamous' instead relies on Perry snogging Truman and similarly clumsy events.
1953;With Philip Seymour Hoffman's superb efforts and the truly empathic understanding of director Bennett Miller, 'Capote' is the film which will stand the test of time.
1954;'Capote' is a really great film and whilst the award of an Oscar doesn't necessarily denote a fine performance, in this case it truly does.
1955;It's compelling, revealing, shocking and utterly memorable.
1956;I never read the book, but the movie (In Cold Blood) remains in my mind one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.
1957;I can understand how Capote got so intrigued by the killers and the potential for his book.
1958;I don't recall ever hearing Capote talk, but I am sure that Hoffman's interpretation was excellent.
1959;"In his quest for the story that became the book ""In Cold Blood,"" one of Capote's most cherished prayers was answered."
1960;This film explores the way that quest and its ending essentially destroyed him.
1961;It is a powerful work.
1962;Capote explores the corrupting power of a story, a story of two men whose humanity was lost for a few dollars when they brutally murdered a family in Kansas during a robbery gone bad.
1963;How curious we all feel to understand the why and how of such an event!
1964;"makers also introduced when they put together their own ""true story"" of Capote's journey."
1965;The film has many levels, as we too then must confront the complexity of our human guilt as witnesses and storytellers ourselves, which I take to be the point of the movie.
1966;"philip Seymour Hoffman won best actor for this picture
1967;His final meeting with Smith (played skillfully but without brilliance by Clifton Collins) is one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen in the cinema.
1968;Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Chris Cooper as the DA who caught the killers are also very good"
1969;busting, understated tension to the part.
1970;"A mixture of biography and historical drama, ""Capote"" focuses on one of the pivotal events in Truman Capote's life
1971;Eventually Capote strikes up a friendship with FBI agent Alvin Dewey in charge of catching the killers (Academy Award winner Chris Cooper).
1972;He finds himself increasing drawn to Perry Smith a young, artistic individual who reminds Capote of a mirror image of himself.
1973;Riveting with powerful performances intelligently written (by actor/writer Dan Futterman) and directed (by Bennett Miller) """"Capote"""" won't be everyone's cup of tea but it's a complex portrait of one of America's major writers at a turning point in his career."""
1974;"an extremely nice transfer from Sony, ""Capote"" has stunning detail and perfectly captures the colors of the film."
1975;Still there is some nice use of the surround channels for sound effects and background noise.
1976;the two most prominent and important special features are the two commentary tracks.
1977;The first features director Miller and actor Hoffman.
1978;Miller and Kimmel focus on the visual aspect of the story and how it compliments both the performances and the story as well as providing interesting behind.
1979;It's an interesting thumb nail sketch of a complex, talented individual who peaked very early in his career.
1980;Capote is a fascinating character study about a complex, conflicted man who began an investigation of the brutal murders of a farm family and ended up becoming part of the story as he searched for the story.
1981;The film looks extremely good despite some minor analog defects and has some solid but basic extras including two strong commentary tracks.
1982;Capote provides us with the drama in both the author's life during a key time in his development as an artist and also how he slid down the slippery slope moving from observer to one of the observed participants related to the horrible murders of an innocent family.
1983;This was an excellent movie.
1984;I did not read the reviews prior to going to see the movie and was pleasantly surprised.
1985;all I can say is that I would highly recommended it.
1986;I've always thought Capote was an interesting character and Philip Seymour Hoffman an above average actor.
1987;i found Capote, or at least the film's version of him as an intriguing and complicated man.
1988;"fiction novel"" with words like those."
1989;"The film ""Capote"" tells of the writer's immediate fascination with the consequences of such an act on a conservative buttoned."
1990;down town and his eventual relationship with the killers who stole Kansas' innocence.
1991;in the film, Capote connects with the killers, as he sees the world divided into two categories: those like the church.
1992;He and the killers belong to the latter group, and only a fine line exists between them.
1993;"his initial quest for a story leads him on a conflicting journey, as he is torn between his duties as a literary journalist and the love he develops for his new ""brothers""."
1994;"hollywood is in the middle of a Renaissance with biographies and ""Capote"" shows them all how less is more."
1995;Capote travels to Kansas with his friend, Harper Lee, hoping to write a story for the New Yorker.
1996;"the acting is absolutely stellar in ""Capote"": it's really an ""actor's movie."""
1997;"He nails the nasally whine of Capote but also captures a deeper essence
1998;style clothing, is also terrific.
1999;I hope this will lead to another Oscar nomination for her.
2000;I've been a fan of his for years, especially his flamboyant work in """"Traffic."""""""
2001;He's finally found a meaty role worthy of his talent.
2002;"the final star of ""Capote"" is the screenplay
2003;The witty script is filled with the kind of bon mots and clever quips Truman Capote himself so often made in television interviews.
2004;The film recreates the 1960s literary scene in all its sexy vibrance.
2005;In Cold Blood arguably is one of the best works of non.
2006;fiction ever, and the 1967 movie adaptation was brilliantly stark and mean.
2007;The conflicted relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting, but it's also strangely unmoving here.
2008;Nevertheless, """"Capote"""" is a very good movie with outstanding writing and acting."""
2009;"The composer is Mychael Danna, who has scored several movies, including ""Being Julia"" and ""Shattered Glass."""
2010;The performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman was so good,it made me think you are watching the real Truman Capote just like watching Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles.
2011;I strongly believe that this film will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman.
2012;His portrayal of Truman Capote is mesmerizing, and it's even more challenging and convincing than his other works including Magnolia, Owning Mahoney, and Love Liza.
2013;truman Capote is an eccentric, humorous, and flamboyant openly gay writer.
2014;Hoffman certainly mastered the feminine mannerism, the babyish voice, and all the tormented heart and soul the Capote to perfection.
2015;Bruce Greenwood is delightful as Capote's affectionate lover, though they didn't have any love scenes to work with.
2016;The most striking supporting performance came from Clifton Collins Jr. who had some heavy duty scenes opposite Hoffman.
2017;paced, especially the first half an hour, it gradually becomes more gripping and emotionally affecting.
2018;Like watching the real Capote!
2019;Truman Capote was a contemporary genius and this movie depicts him wonderfully!
2020;She and the class have enjoyed it and it has added another dimension to teaching.
