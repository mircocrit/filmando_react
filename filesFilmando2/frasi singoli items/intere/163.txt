I:13417;1;A great gangster / mafia movie with a high profile cast of actors.
I:13417;2;the thing that really captured me the first time I saw this movie was that it was a very well direct and solid production.
I:13417;3;i guess now Al Pacino has played mafia characters at the two extreme ends of the mafia hierarchy from family head to solider.
I:13417;4;overall, a great movie with great suspense, however does require close attention to the dialogue and events of the movie to fully appreciate the plot.
I:13417;5;"get out of this life is all I'm saying!"""
I:13417;6;I think what makes this movie so powerful is the sense that the viewer is discovering things at the same time as the main character , Donnie .
I:13417;7;for me , it is up there with the first 2 Godfather films and Goodfellas .
I:13417;8;the film is well made and will not disappoint .
I:13417;9;This is an absolutely GREAT mob flick, and it's also one of the first movies to start Johnny Depp into more mature and serious roles.
I:13417;10;His Portrayal of Joe Pistone is amazing.
I:13417;11;Additionally, Al Pacino's portrayal of Lefty Two Guns, Donnie Brasco's Mentor, is ALSO amazing.
I:13417;12;this movie is especially good because it's a mob movie done from the other side of the spectrum.
I:13417;13;basically, what you get is a main character who is human and has all the traits of a normal person, but it also shows the human side of the mob.
I:13417;14;Depp's portrayal of this is fantastic, and I can't say enough about how much I like this movie.
I:13417;15;Al Pacino is easily in the top 10 Hollywood actors of all time, and Jonnie Depp is great too.
I:13417;16;The depth of feeling, the subtlety of expression in the acting of Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, and Anne Heche.
I:13417;17;The fact that those lives do not resemble ours very much at all makes the film fascinating, but not foreign or artificial in any way.
I:13417;18;Great film, in the clearest picture yet.
I:13417;19;This movie, has more meaning to it than any movie I have ever watched.
I:13417;20;"Depp, is trying to balance everything
I:13417;21;"In real life, ""Lefty"" was picked up by the police just before that happened."
I:13417;22;He is very nice person.
I:13417;23;Pachino is awesome, as is Depp.
I:13417;24;Really nice work by both actors.
I:13417;25;I recommend it highly.You won't be disappointed.
I:13417;26;Pacino's character is vulnerable and lovable.
I:13417;27;Johnny Depp is outstanding and the plot line is great.
I:13417;28;He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship.
I:13417;29;The featurette titled Donnie Brasco: Out of the Shadows was excellent.
I:13417;30;It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew.
I:13417;31;This is a film that stands on its own on many levels.
I:13417;32;It was perfectly cast with Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche.
I:13417;33;If you like mob movies or just fine acting this is one film you need to see.
I:13417;34;Constantly I was reminded of other movies that are better then this one.
I:13417;35;I had high hopes for the film, but the big.
I:13417;36;In fact, if you thought Michael Madsen's one.
I:13417;37;Leave it at Goodfellas, and move on.
I:13417;38;i think its great the movie was great.
I:13417;39;al pacino was great as well in the movie i love him as an actor and in this movie he was so convincing.
I:13417;40;Sure, it is not in the same caliber as the all time greats (Godfather I and II or Once Upon The Time in America), but it is, an excellent addition to the genre.
I:13417;41;"This was a compelling movie that really hits the spot when it comes to detailing two ""Goodfellas"" joined at the hip."
I:13417;42;This was a great character study of not just a federal agent but the man he eventually betrays.
I:13417;43;That's something I despise about him and any undercover fed.
I:13417;44;lefty treats Donnie as a son and Donnie gets emotionally involved.
I:13417;45;In his own way Lefty has a big heart, his hopes and dreams.
I:13417;46;bit by bit both Lefty's and Donnie's lives derail.
I:13417;47;Does risking everything justify the costs?Based on a true story this marvelous film shows the dirt as it is.
I:13417;48;Both Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give larger than life performances.
I:13417;49;The supporting cast is terrific as is the directing.
I:13417;50;The 70s style indoor lighting helps turn it into a timeless masterpiece.
I:13417;51;ray disc is sharp as can be.
I:13417;52;This is a beautiful transfer, on an excellent mob film.
I:13417;53;Deleted scenes, directors commmentary, and other special features are done very well, but the movie is classic.
I:13417;54;Johnny Depp and Al Pacino play off eachother so well, that they make this true story into a cinema masterpiece.
I:13417;55;Color me surprised, but this movie was downright fantastic.
I:13417;56;Instead, what I found was a deeply moving, completely engrossing, totally organic and convincing portrait of the grit that is the life of crime AND the life of those who try and prevent it.
I:13417;57;He is one of those actors who was SO good and then suddenly became nothing more than a clich .
I:13417;58;That said, his performance in `Donnie Brasco' is a work of genius.
I:13417;59;He really reaches back to his glory days and delivers an outstanding portrayal of a man intent of surviving yet never so much that he loses touch of what makes him human.
I:13417;60;Watching Lefty interact with the ruthless people around him brings an odd fascination.
I:13417;61;He is strong and certainly authentic, but he feels almost too warm at times, which adds to his character's remarkable development (such a superbly crafted sympathetic character that never grates on clich d manipulative sentiments).
I:13417;62;It is very cool to like Johnny Depp, but personally he hasn't delivered a strong performance for me in many years.
I:13417;63;I was hesitant to watch this film because I am not a fan of either Pacino or Depp, but I must say that this may be Depp's finest performance to date (I adore him in `Benny and Joon', but the depth he brings to Donnie is completely remarkable).
I:13417;64;like I said, color me surprised.
I:13417;65;with outstanding supporting performances by Anne Heche and Michael Madsen, not to mention a memorable turn from Bruno Kirby (so underrated in his day as a supporting player), `Donnie Brasco' is an acting triumph.
I:13417;66;Not just that, it is marvelously scripted to completely engage the audience.
I:13417;67;The film has so much grit and realism.
I:13417;68;You can really see both sides of this world, and the film makes no attempts to glamorize of paint this `life' as something jovial.
I:13417;69;Mike Newell's direction is stellar, completely capturing the emotional as well as the visual impact of the subject.
I:13417;70;It is simply outstanding in all respects.
I:13417;71;DONNIE BRASCO is an excellent film in every way.
I:13417;72;nominated screenplay is complexly layered.
I:13417;73;The performances are all of the highest calibre.
I:13417;74;Pacino should have received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Lefty and Anne Heche deserved a nod in the Supporting Actress performance as Donnie's put upon wife.
I:13417;75;This was Depp's first great performance as well.
I:13417;76;His Donnie has to be able to operate on three levels simultaneously .
I:13417;77;a subtle and galvanized performance.
I:13417;78;Donnie gives him a chance to believe in something and becomes his surrogate son.
I:13417;79;Donnie in turn gives Lefty the respect and schemes for wealth that have been absent from his life.
I:13417;80;it is an emotional film and one very taut and tense.
I:13417;81;The whole thing is superbly directed by Mike Newell, who manges to extract amazing nuances from a script that Scorcese would have trampled over.
I:13417;82;"as well as the ""language"" of the streets."
I:13417;83;there is an excellent and unobstrusive dramatic score.
I:13417;84;To sum up: This is an excellent film about ugly people with a superb script, fine direction and top notch performances.
I:13417;85;One of the best and Depp's first step up the ladder to his position today as America's best screen actor.
I:13417;86;Awesome acting, captivating story, Depp does an remarkable job as Pistone, I highly recommend the film.
I:13417;87;First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most.
I:13417;88;The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one.
I:13417;89;The performances are absolutely superb.
I:13417;90;Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a. k. a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible.
I:13417;91;this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man Lefty (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations .
I:13417;92;The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real.
I:13417;93;phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, a wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.
I:13417;94;deserves at least four stars.
I:13417;95;This is one of the most underrated movies ever made.
I:13417;96;With Al Pacino, he's been brilliant so often that it's a challenge to explain why he's unique in this role.
I:13417;97;As for Depp, he won me over a decade ago with Ed Wood, and his portrayal of Brasco is sensational.
I:13417;98;If you gave a role like this to DiCaprio, it would be a disaster, yet Depp is infinitely competent.
I:13417;99;Lastly, Madsen as Sonny Black was a real treat.
I:13417;100;There's laughs, there's serious moments, and all in all we have a peek at what a real Undercover FBI agent went through to break up a chunk of the Mafia.
I:13417;101;This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:13417;102;Excellent cast, especially Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.
I:13417;103;"Keeps you on the ""edge of your seat"" the whole time."
I:13417;104;I love that this movie is based on a real story.
I:13417;105;The acting is excellent and the movie will keep you interested to the end.
I:13417;106;If you are into the whole underground world of the mafia than watch this movie cause it has all the twists and turns that all of those movies in that genre offer.
I:13417;107;Good movie based on real life FBI undercover agent working with the mob.
I:13417;108;so I highly recommend this movie.
I:13417;109;Lefty is a man who by his admission has murdered 26 men.
I:13417;110;this is still pretty entertaining, despite these shortcomings.
I:13417;111;overall, based on a real story both Pachino and Depp do a great job in portraying the overall theme of the movie.
I:13417;112;This is one of my favorites.
I:13417;113;Depp and Pacino are magnificent together.
I:13417;114;Anne Heche is also very good.
I:13417;115;Wrong choice in this film.
I:13417;116;This is an all around outstanding film.
I:13417;117;The script is great, the acting is great.
I:13417;118;The scenery and costumes all feel very real.
I:13417;119;Joe Pistone is a true American hero.
I:13417;120;This movie ranks with Godfather I and II and Goodfellas for the best Mafia flicks of all time.
I:13417;121;ray and enjoy it more than ever.
I:13417;122;such a classic movie a must have in your collection.
I:13417;123;This movie is by far one of the best Mafia films ever made.
I:13417;124;Pacino is excellent, Madsen is fabulous, and Depp is great as well.
I:13417;125;Naturally the book version is way more detailed but this movie is exceptional.
I:13417;126;This movie gives you some real insight of what it is like to be involved with the Mafia.
I:13417;127;I bought it so I could watch it again and again .
I:13417;128;I thought this documentary of Joe Pistone was brilliant because it showed the struggles he had to go through in order to survive on a daily basis.
I:13417;129;I am sure the movie description written for the product is better than anything I could ever write, so I will just leave it as this is a good movie that I got a great deal on the Blu.
I:13417;130;It's a superb movie .
I:13417;131;one of the best depicting the true picture and psyche of the mafia.
I:13417;132;Johnny Depp is oustanding and Al Pacino gives one of his best performances ever in this movie.
I:13417;133;This item came ontime and was in perfect condition.
I:13417;134;He is a terrific actor, but not in this one.
I:13417;135;But, Johnny Depp surprised me with his performance that seemed to fit the mold more naturally.
I:13417;136;the ending to the movie was very unpredictable and changed the entire context of the movie.
I:13417;137;Watching Depp's character evolve and his (the character's) role overtake his life is a study in masterful character development.
I:13417;138;The rest of the cast are also wonderful.
I:13417;139;The real Donnie Brasco, (Joe Pistone) tells a much more gripping story in the book.
I:13417;140;Although this movie is based on Pistone's book, many scenes are fiction.
I:13417;141;That's okay, though, this movie is very entertaining and features an outstanding cast: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche (who gets FAR too little screen time but is terrific nevertheless), and especially Michael Madsen, who's one of my favorite actors.
I:13417;142;The acting is great, the script is believable, and the music is fabulous.
I:13417;143;Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances and Al Pacino is awesome as usual.
I:13417;144;For those that enjoy mafia movies this is an absolute must.
I:13417;145;Mike Newell's film is an original addition to a genre that has been mined many times but as proven here still has some life to it.
I:13417;146;Also, you can a sense that Pistone is starting to enjoy his life as Donnie Brasco.
I:13417;147;Depp adds another great character to his evergrowing gallery of great performances without overplaying it.
I:13417;148;One can feel a sense of empathy for his character for all the disappointments in his life.
I:13417;149;Michael Madsen also delivers a chilling performance as mobster Sonny Black.
I:13417;150;the came on time and in great shape.
I:13417;151;donnie brasco is a great movie, if you like a good mob movie check it out.
I:13417;152;delivery was fast, price was good and the product was exactly as advertised.
I:13417;153;I don't usually like violent films, but this is truly a great movie based on a true story of the mob.
I:13417;154;I was wrong to, it will always be one of my favorites.
I:13417;155;Enough action, but more subtle than Goodfellas.
I:13417;156;Actually a mobster film that a guy and gal watching together would enjoy.
I:13417;157;of course, Pacino's was memorable and Depp's completely believable, but I really liked Michael Madsen's performance in this.
I:13417;158;"More than just a gangland saga like ""Goodfellows"" or ""The Godfather"", ""Donnie Brasco"" is a intimate love story between two men which ends in tragedy and torment for both."
I:13417;159;There are also solid portrayals by Michael Madsen, the late Bruno Kirby and James Russo as the wise guys.
I:13417;160;ray is excellent in sound and visuals.
I:13417;161;This film captures that reality, while at the same time riveting the viewer's attention.
I:13417;162;al Pacino, once again, is magnificent.
I:13417;163;At the price, this is a great bargain.
I:13417;164;"Although I haven't read the book from which this movie is based on, I loved ""Donnie Brasco."""
I:13417;165;Neeless to say, I was impressed with his performance in this movie.
I:13417;166;toe with the best in the business.
I:13417;167;Of course, Pacino was excellent in this movie also.
I:13417;168;"I also enjoyed Michael Madsen (better known for his role as Mr. Blonde in ""Reservoir Dogs"") although, the entire movie I wass waiting for something as memorable as the infamous ""ear scene"" from ""Reservoir Dogs"" from him."
I:13417;169;"All in all, I have to say that ""Donnie Brasco"" is a great, underrated movie, and is now amongst my favorites."
I:13417;170;Its based on a true story!
I:13417;171;Johnny Depp is one of the best actors of his generation.
I:13417;172;This is a very good movie with great performances by Pacino, Depp and Madsen.
I:13417;173;Mike Newell did a marvelous job and the actors are superb.
I:13417;174;I've always admired Pacino as an actor and his choices but here in this film he is a true artist.
I:13417;175;This performance proves that Pacino's talents are truly a gift and are limitless.
I:13417;176;And Johnny Depp what a terrific surprise.
I:13417;177;I loved watching him and Pacino together.
I:13417;178;Like I said this movie is a masterpiece.
I:13417;179;Its real, its deep and its special.
I:13417;180;This is brilliant because of the story, the tension, the characters, and the setting that they're all in.
I:13417;181;This leads to a confrontation with his job and his own family.
I:13417;182;pacino, Depp, and Madsen give wonderful performances.
I:13417;183;Heche, Kirby, and Russo make a stunning supporting cast.
I:13417;184;Lots of tension and lots of drama and humor.
I:13417;185;Best gangsta movie out there!!!!
I:13417;186;This movie is so real.
I:13417;187;I love it and can watch it over and over again.
I:13417;188;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp made an awesome team, there wit, charisma and tough guy attitude made the movie cant wait for the longer version to be made available for instant streaming through amazon super good movie with a good cast.
I:13417;189;Donnie Brasco is definitely one of my top 10 movies.
I:13417;190;It's not so much because it's a movie about the Mafia, but because the humanizing performance both Pacino and Depp give in this memorable film.
I:13417;191;of course, the story is simply great .
I:13417;192;pacino's performance here is one of his best.
I:13417;193;There's a bit of over.
I:13417;194;acting in some scenes, but overall, he makes Lefty a likeable mobster that we even come to pity and root for.
I:13417;195;It is well worth it!
I:13417;196;A good actor is one who we forget is on the screen seeing the character rather than the performer.
I:13417;197;Johnny Depp seems to achieve this often in his career and once again we are treated to an outstanding performance in Donnie Brasco.
I:13417;198;Depp and Al Pacino both give Oscar worthy efforts as you see the fondness develop between their characters over the course of the story making the inevitable ending that much tougher for Pistone to deal with.
I:13417;199;Johnny Depp is my favorite actor hands down.
I:13417;200;He has been for about 14 years now!
I:13417;201;if you are a Johnny fan I definitely recommend it.
I:13417;202;Al Pacino does a great job playing an aging Mafioso and Johnny Depp is great as the undercover agent.
I:13417;203;The characters and their relationships are all well developed and interesting.
I:13417;204;this is a great movie.
I:13417;205;and it was just as good the second time
I:13417;206;I seen the movie a long time ago and I thought it would be good to look at every now and then and also to show guest when then come over to visit.
I:13417;207;DONNIE BRASCO is Johnny Depp's bright light moment.
I:13417;208;Mike Newell's direction again makes the point that Eurpoean's have a fresh view of American film and it's most stalwart genres.
I:13417;209;"This is not just yet another mobster movie
I:13417;210;I haven't read the book but I found this movie so real and intense.
I:13417;211;I've seen this movie so many times and after all these years I still enjoy it.
I:13417;212;One of the best movies about mafia, i have ever seen !
I:13417;213;I noticed that 'true stories' that are diverted into films always become some of the most epic films ever seen, and sometimes it can be embarassing i. e Ed Wood and Pollock.
I:13417;214;Donnie Brasco, maybe one of the most famed and celebrated films of the late 90s was also the most brilliantly acted from the entire cast.
I:13417;215;From extras to supporting roles such as the fantastic Michael Madsen and his rendition of Sonny Black.
I:13417;216;Against the odds, Al risks himself and Donnie ascends at impressive rhythm when he acquires an original feature before Sonny Black.
I:13417;217;interesting proposal, I think this was the film who revealed Johnny Depp as a solid actor, far beyond his previous works, this was a difficult performance with many inflexions and dramatic changes, but his countenance and talent made the rest.
I:13417;218;Pacino and Madsen are terrific too in this bloody thriller of betray and greed.
I:13417;219;good point for Mike Newell behind the camera.
I:13417;220;This is one of the best gangster movies ever made.
I:13417;221;the extended version is great, as the additional scenes flesh out the story and just make the movie all that better, with more scenes!Nothing crazy about the extras .
I:13417;222;just a few solid featurettes.
I:13417;223;Donnie Brasco eschews the melodrama of lots of mafia films and creates a personal, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and social film all in one.
I:13417;224;and to top it off it's aesthetically brilliant, and Al Pacino reaches somewhere (not sure where) and creates the most on target portrayal he or just about any actor has done on film.
I:13417;225;it's the best commentary I've ever heard.
I:13417;226;It was a great story that sits with some of the best mob pictures out there.
I:13417;227;Depp gives an amazing performance and Pacino is as always great.
I:13417;228;The story is gripping and the huor makesit very enjoyable.
I:13417;229;The fact that this is based on a true story also makes it more compelling.
I:13417;230;One word of caution though the story in the movie is pretty far off from what really happened to Agent Pistone but it is still a great movie.
I:13417;231;Check out the book as well and you will like it even more.
I:13417;232;The music is in fact one of the many strong points of this film.
I:13417;233;Anne Heche (who I don't normally love) is good, too.
I:13417;234;But it's also like saying Go to hell!
I:13417;235;Donnie Brasco, far more than other movies in the genre, takes this possibility and turns it into the driving force behind its emotional impact.
I:13417;236;It is a welcome relief from the near.
I:13417;237;glorification of gangster life in late 80s and early 90s movies such as Casino, Scarface, and others, and it injected a much.
I:13417;238;After winning the trust and confidence of low.
I:13417;239;based on a true story, Donnie Brasco rings true throughout, uncompromising and unflinching.
I:13417;240;Depp and Pacino deliver outstanding performances, and Anne Heche, in a supporting role as Joe's increasingly frustrated wife, shines in her best role to date.
I:13417;241;the movie is bound to become a classic, not only in the gangster genre but in American filmmaking as well.
I:13417;242;It's a special Special Edition, and definitely worth the cost.
I:13417;243;he plays a loser trying keep his head above water with great conviction.
I:13417;244;Johnny Depp holds his own on the screen and gives another great performance as well.
I:13417;245;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp bring down the house with their stunning performances.
I:13417;246;This movie is a must see.
I:13417;247;It arrived quick and in perfect condition.
I:13417;248;I always catch alot of grief for this, but I gotta say this is one of the greatest mobster movies of all time.
I:13417;249;This movie grips you right from the get go.
I:13417;250;The story line is awesome.
I:13417;251;And Depp and Pacino together are priceless.
I:13417;252;If you haven't seen it, you have to!
I:13417;253;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp are amazing as ever .
I:13417;254;it's really keeps your interest and watching carefully through the end, and at that time you'll probably want to watch it again.
I:13417;255;Pacino was fantastic as Lefty Ruggiero.
I:13417;256;Both lead actors turned in the most amazing performances, I was so happy!
I:13417;257;I loved this movie so much!
I:13417;258;It was actually the first mob film I've seen.
I:13417;259;I also liked Michael Madsen's performance as Sonny Black, he was great!
I:13417;260;at the end you find out that there is still a hit out on don e brasco which is kind of cool.
I:13417;261;michael madsen is also in this movie and is kind of cool he was in reservoir dogs which was a cool movie.
I:13417;262;don e brasco on the other hand is very sexy.
I:13417;263;This movie is definitely one of the best.
I:13417;264;"This is probably one of the most realistic ""mob movies"" ever."
I:13417;265;ray edition is the best ever with some extended scenes and unmatched clarity.
I:13417;266;I only look into real movies when i really enjoy them.
I:13417;267;This one was really good.
I:13417;268;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp shine in this based.
I:13417;269;The film itself is wonderful, although I hear it's not as good as the book (isn't that usually the case?)
I:13417;270;it's still a worthwhile addition to your Mob or Pacino collection!
I:13417;271;This is one of my favorite Depp or Pacino movies.
I:13417;272;These two make a great mob/ wiseguy flick that delivers on all fronts.
I:13417;273;Good suspense, great acting, great plot, and its all based on a true story.
I:13417;274;A tough and unglamorous look at the workings of the mob in 1970's New York with Johnny Depp and Al Pacino excellent in the lead roles.
I:13417;275;A memorable movie enhanced by a great blue.
I:13417;276;Besides having a great script and superb acting, this film is special for another reason.
I:13417;277;Throughout film history many actors have tried to capture the essence of being cool.
I:13417;278;It's the type of movie you'll watch over and over.
I:13417;279;This is my favorite movie of all time and I think one of the best great actor teams in Pacino and Depp.
I:13417;280;An excellently told true story, based on the book by the real guy, Agent Joseph Pistone.
I:13417;281;Incredible performances by Pacino, Depp, and supporting actor, Michael Madsen.
I:13417;282;"Donnie Brasco is a crime drama based upon a true story
I:13417;283;This 1997 movie stars Anne Heche, James Russo, Rocco Sisto, Brian Tarantina, Robert Miano, Zeljko Ivanek, Bruno Kirby, Michael Madsen, Johnny Depp, and Al Pacino.
I:13417;284;Donnie Brasco has all the excitement of a trip to the grocery store for a gallon of milk and a pack of cigarettes.
I:13417;285;But I'll be honest .
I:13417;286;Everyone who sees this will love it.
I:13417;287;This is a great mafia/FBI movie.
I:13417;288;Great acting and great story.
I:13417;289;I'm sure Joe Pistone himself is proud.
I:13417;290;displays courage of FBI Agent Pistone and the extent he went on risking his life to conduct the undercover operation
I:13417;291;One of the best mob films I have ever seen.
I:13417;292;Depp, Pacino, Madsen give a great performance, this film is so under rated it should be up there with Wise Guys and Casino.
I:13417;293;He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship.
I:13417;294;"The featurette titled ""Donnie Brasco: Out of the Shadows"" was excellent."
I:13417;295;It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew.
I:13417;296;This is a film that stands on its own on many levels.
I:13417;297;It was perfectly cast with Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche.
I:13417;298;If you like mob movies or just fine acting this is one film you need to see.
I:13417;299;"life Joe Pistone's memoirs, Mike Newell's ""Donnie Brasco"" offers one of the freshest takes on the gangster film since ""GoodFellas,"" capturing gritty street life in 1970s New York City as well as the melancholy mood of the times."
I:13417;300;In one of the great roles of his late career, Pacino excels as Mafia nobody Lefty, combining a wise guy's street swagger with a loving, fatherly air as he takes Donnie under his wing.
I:13417;301;Depp is equally strong as the conflicted cop, dutifully mining information but increasingly strained by his dual life.
I:13417;302;A gritty, poignant drama of divided loyalties.
I:13417;303;In 1976, the government of the United States took on the Mafia in perhaps one of the greatest showdowns in crime history.
I:13417;304;As time goes by, Brasco makes connections with the high.
I:13417;305;ranking officials of the New York Mafia by making himself visible and gaining their trust by way of business and clout.
I:13417;306;After perfectly keeping up his act as Donnie Brasco for more than five years, Joe Pistone, his wife (Anne Heche) and children go into the witness protection program under which they still live.
I:13417;307;Donnie Brasco is a brilliant and immersive gangster drama.
I:13417;308;"the story is very engaging and genuinely intriguing
I:13417;309;"There are many scenes that are extremely tense
I:13417;310;I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film, especially when you realize how deep their connection was.
I:13417;311;"Johnny Depp and Al Pacino have amazing performances
I:13417;312;The film also has a great soundtrack.
I:13417;313;ray of this film is excellent.
I:13417;314;This is the definitive version of this film.
I:13417;315;"watch for fans of gangster/crime dramas
I:13417;316;watch for film fans in general.
I:13417;317;If you have ever thought of becoming a wise guy you have to see this movie.
I:13417;318;A great combination of a wonderful script and terrific acting by both pacino and Depp.
I:13417;319;For Mafia fans this is a must see.
I:13417;320;One of the best all time greatest mob movies!
I:13417;321;I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and this movie shows off his very diverse acting ability.
I:13417;322;He was utterly sensational as the title character.
I:13417;323;The supporting cast did wonderful.
I:13417;324;"The story line is good
I:13417;325;"But despite that, Donnie Brasco is one of the best films I have ever seen
I:13417;326;I highly recommend this movie to people who have seen (and like) films like: Goodfellas, The Departed, etc. this movie is right up there with those.
I:13417;327;This is an all around great movie it has it's drama side, violent side, and a funny side.
I:13417;328;what you have to do is listen to the way they talk to each other its funny.
I:13417;329;Also the way Nicky is in the movie with the little smart comments its quite funny.
I:13417;330;But all in all Its a great movie.
I:13417;331;I received the movie about a week after I bought it.
I:13417;332;This is one of the more entertaining films in its genre.
I:13417;333;The teaming of Johnny Depp and Al Pacino was a brilliant stroke, and both deliver outstanding performances.
I:13417;334;Michael Madsen also gives a noteworthy performance as Sonny Black, the capo who very nearly inducted Pistone into the Bonnano crime family.
I:13417;335;They acted well and story is good.
I:13417;336;Classic and definitely worth to include this title in my collection.
I:13417;337;Normally most movie don't make me feel sad but this one hit me in the heart.
I:13417;338;Also the intriguing part about this story is that it was a true story.
I:13417;339;I believe that this is one of Depp's best performances that I've seen and this adds another angle to the mafia underworld.
I:13417;340;Its an xmas gift so I think it will be perfect.
I:13417;341;Hope you have a great holiday season and thanks.
I:13417;342;If you like mafia movies, you'll love Donnie Brasco.
I:13417;343;I especially loved it because it is based on a true story.
I:13417;344;Still, there is much in the camaraderie of the Family that Pistone appreciates.
I:13417;345;Donnie Brasco is a true mafia masterpiece and what is more interesting about it is that it is based on an amazing true story.
I:13417;346;This is the true story of FBI undercover agent Joseph D. Pistone, who when faced with the task of infiltrating a New York City family, he not only does that, but he did it with perfection.
I:13417;347;He truly deserves all of the accolades that he earned for this role.
I:13417;348;Al Pacino's performance was superior for this movie.
I:13417;349;This was an Oscar winning performance on his part, the only missing part was the actual best supporting Oscar.
I:13417;350;The performances by Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, Anne Heche and all of the other actors in this outstanding film all served beautifully in making this film the true silver screen masterpiece that it is.
I:13417;351;it's kind of odd that British director Mike Newell of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame would get the directing nod for Donnie Brasco but in the end, it worked out perfectly and he deserves a great amount of credit for the style and atmosphere of this film.
I:13417;352;The score for Donnie Brasco plays perfectly with every scene of the film, serving to enhance the story.
I:13417;353;for any fan of the mob movie genre, I highly recommend this film as it gives a perfect look at the mob lifestyle and it easily ranks up there with many of the famous mob movies.
I:13417;354;This movie will certainly bear multiple viewings.
I:13417;355;a good job, though, in showing us his feelings and not condemning him for doing so.
I:13417;356;There are several subtle metaphors, the most hilarious (to me) being the one of the gift of the lion.
I:13417;357;So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.
I:13417;358;He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates.
I:13417;359;"He is befriended by ""Lefty"" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino."
I:13417;360;"The existence of ""Lefty"" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride."
I:13417;361;Lefty takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him.
I:13417;362;"He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a ""made"" guy."
I:13417;363;Lefty himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy.
I:13417;364;The bond between the two men grows.
I:13417;365;al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film.
I:13417;366;Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize.
I:13417;367;Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent.
I:13417;368;All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.
I:13417;369;time Mafia gangster and exposes the unique and complex violent world of organized crime.
I:13417;370;He has cancer, his son is a junky and he has never moved up in the Mafia hierarchy.
I:13417;371;this is a film about the inner workings of the Mafia.
I:13417;372;And so, in addition to the numerous scenes of murder and violence, there is a basic humanity to this film which not only held my interest because of the plot, but which gave these two actors roles that were complex and deep and which required outstanding nuanced performances.
I:13417;373;It is perfect in every way.
I:13417;374;This movie was one of the best Mafia movies I've ever seen.
I:13417;375;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp do an exemplory job.
I:13417;376;I like the newly added scenes.
I:13417;377;I think it improved the film and made it more complete.
I:13417;378;I also like Michael Madsen in the film and his character.
I:13417;379;Colours look nice and such.
I:13417;380;Donnie Brasco is a movie based on a real life autobiography describing an FBI agent's undercover life in the Mafia and a criminal partnership that also develops int a deep friendship.
I:13417;381;Lefty becomes his mentor, showing deep trust in the man he knows as Donnie.
I:13417;382;With divided loyalties, he risks his life, his marriage, his job and Lefty, the mentor that becomes his friend.
I:13417;383;depp and Pacino, as well as the supporting cast of Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, Michael Madsen and James Russo show extraordinary acting, and give compelling character studies to this gritty undercover criminal story.
I:13417;384;This is a world classic movie.
I:13417;385;i also loved Michael Madsen impersonification of Sonny .
I:13417;386;fantastic acting!Great movie , great story, greatest acting, and greatest shame on the academy award judges of that year for not having chosenthis fantastic movie.
I:13417;387;5stars to this movie,its a good gangster movie with a twist of rat.
I:13417;388;I recommend it to anyone who likes gangster and al Pacino
I:13417;389;If you like mob flicks, Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, this will entertain.
I:13417;390;Allegedly based on a true story.
I:13417;391;This movie is based on a true story, and so gives us morally conflicted characters.
I:13417;392;Depp and Pacino both give solid performances.
I:13417;393;An absolute classic from beginning to end.
I:13417;394;He meets Lefty 'two guns'Ruggiero played superbly by Al Pacino who immediately befriends him and thorugh him Donnie Brasco antoher stellar performance from Johnny Depp manages to enter the mob and learn first hand the true workings of the mafia.
I:13417;395;Set in the early 80's in New York City, this story is one that must be seen and heard and this film gives this unforgettable encounter true justice.
I:13417;396;We also get to meet the superb cast behind the scenes.
I:13417;397;The likes of Al Pacino , Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Anne Heche et all, help in making this movie so great.
I:13417;398;Donnie Brasco is based on a true story but it is still gripping.
I:13417;399;He joins the mob as a help of Lefty played by Al Pacino.
I:13417;400;Pacino again plays a great mobster.
I:13417;401;depp and Pacino are of course brilliant as ever and this is another great maffia movie like Goodfellas are the Godfather.
I:13417;402;Probably my favorite Johnny Depp movie.
I:13417;403;This movie is right up there in the Good Fells, Godfather I and II pantheon.
I:13417;404;He kept is overacting in check and was phenomenal.
I:13417;405;Johnny Depp and Ann Heche were also excellent.
I:13417;406;the two leads give dynamic and outstanding performances as Donnie and Lefty.
I:13417;407;its based on the real Brascos life and its made with such class and sophisticating.
I:13417;408;great job by Mike Newell
I:13417;409;DONNIE BRASCO is a highly accurate and in depth look at the complexities involved in undercover police work.
I:13417;410;Based on the true story of Joe Pistone, BRASCO gives us an excellent cast, headed by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, in showing us the underworld of the Mafia through the eyes of the guys on the lower end of the stick.
I:13417;411;Depp in his undercover role as a wiseguy to Pacino, endangers his married life (Anne Heche in a strong performance), and finds himself becoming attached to Pacino, in spite of what he knows is going to happen in the future.
I:13417;412;Michael Madsen gives one of his best performances as Johnny Black, a mover who wants to take Depp away from Pacino.
I:13417;413;Pacino is brilliant and manages to make a guy who has killed over 25 people sympathetic, and Depp is amazing in this unusual role, giving Brasco the audience's compassion in his role of the betrayer.
I:13417;414;A fine gangster film well directed by Mike Newell.
I:13417;415;Great New York gangster movie.
I:13417;416;All catalog releases should look this good, and the movie itself is nothing to sneeze at, with a performance from Pacino that makes you both feel for him and want to hit him at the same time.
I:13417;417;Based on a true story that is so amazing and shocking, Donnie Brasco is a fantastic film that hooks you from start to finish.
I:13417;418;With stars like Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, and many more, this is a movie that should be seen by all.
I:13417;419;He brings him into the family and the world of the Mafia.
I:13417;420;This unforgettable picture shows us that sometimes you can become what you chase if you're in too long, and that in order to catch a monster you may become one yourself in the process.
I:13417;421;It's one of my favorites that I have seen over and over again, and it hasn't gotten old yet.
I:13417;422;The acting and directing is all fantastic.
I:13417;423;Al Pacino really shines, as always, and Johnny Depp gives an Academy Award performance as the FBI agent.
I:13417;424;Michael Madsen is also terrific and can once again send chills down our spines just as he did in Reservoir Dogs.
I:13417;425;"Especially the picture
I:13417;426;all in all, Donnie Brasco is an outstanding picture on all fronts.
I:13417;427;Filled with drama and suspense, this is a film that will take you deep into the world of the Mafia.
I:13417;428;Some of the funniest yet awesome portrails and acting.
I:13417;429;Goodfellas was the first Mafia movie that actually got it right.
I:13417;430;This is a good movie.
I:13417;431;Only one or two instances of added material really added something to the story or movie as a whole, to my mind: most of it actually detracted from my experience of the movie .
I:13417;432;I have been wanting to see this movie for what seems like years now, due to the fact I love Mob movies and Johnny Depp's acting ability in any film he does.
I:13417;433;This is one of Johnny Depps first Big leading roles in a film and he holds up even against the great Al Pacino.
I:13417;434;lewis in Gangs of New York should have won last year no questions asked!)
I:13417;435;Michael Madsen is always a fun actor to watch on screen and this is one of his best performances.
I:13417;436;Anne Heche really impressed me with her acting as well and she actually looked kinda hot.
I:13417;437;The last scene in this film featuring Al Pacino opening a drawer, putting in a few precious items, closing it, only to open it again and leave it ajar a few moments later is truly powerful because of what it implies.
I:13417;438;He introduces himself as Don the jeweller .
I:13417;439;He immediately gains the respect and love of Lefty (Al Pacino), and he is presented to the rest of the crew as a a friend of Lefty's .
I:13417;440;But what makes the film the masterpiece that it is, the warm and brilliantly acted and realised central relationship between Donnie/Joe and Lefty.
I:13417;441;I read an interview with director Mike Newel where he called the film a love story , and that is absolutely right.
I:13417;442;Nevermind the fact that Pacino's autopilot is more gripping then most actors' most vivid characterisation, his performance in Donnie Brasco is arguably his best.
I:13417;443;He delivers his lines with is patented fiery intensity, but this time he lets you know he's bluffing, that he' can't back up that big mouth of his.
I:13417;444;He shines in two particular scenes, one in the hospital and the other is final haunting scene.
I:13417;445;is Donnie Brasco one of the best gangster pictures ever made?
I:13417;446;Fuggedaboutit (in the positive sense of the phrase).
I:13417;447;It deserves to sit at the same table and have coffee on the house with the masterpiece of the genre, Goodfellas.
I:13417;448;A great movie, really tense, and showing a side of wiseguys not usually shown in the movies in the Pacino character 'Lefty' who is poor and basically a donkey worker.
I:13417;449;With great acting from Al and Depp, the only thing that lets this movie down from 5 stars is the scatty story which is based on actual events.
I:13417;450;All in all a great movie.
I:13417;451;Donnie Brasco should have been a great movie.
I:13417;452;The book was an excellent read.
I:13417;453;He was very happy to add these to his collection.
I:13417;454;The story, the writing, the direction, and of course the acting .
I:13417;455;He is a terrific actor.
I:13417;456;I found this movie to be quite entertaining because of the acting and interaction between the stars, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, of whom I am a big fan and have collected all his films.
I:13417;457;this movie has its twists and turns to keep you interested and therefore I recommend this movie to everyone.
I:13417;458;A great storyline with great actors.
I:13417;459;This film portrays a realistic look at the inner.
I:13417;460;i was refreshed by the multidimensional role of lefty (played by Pacino).
I:13417;461;toughened gangster and then you see a more vulnerable side to his character.
I:13417;462;This is a must have if you love mobster movies.
I:13417;463;Johnny Depp is amazing in this film.
I:13417;464;Donnie Brasco is one of those movies I always regarded well.
I:13417;465;we've seen much better written and acted drama involving the Mafia since this movie appeared.
I:13417;466;He hung around for a few more years, even meeting with a couple of bosses, until he ended the assignment and went on to help put about a hundred wiseguys in jail.
I:13417;467;Pacino is perfect as the rumpled, passed.
I:13417;468;Depp seems much older, and he holds his own.
I:13417;469;The rest of the cast is good, though we get the feeling they're not acting so much as playing up stereotypes of guys they've seen in other movies, or even played (Bruno Kirby).
I:13417;470;ized Mafia, it can be a lot of fun.
I:13417;471;Absoluetly worth seeing and owning.
I:13417;472;Depp and Pacino are fantastic in this true story of Joseph D. Pistone, special agent for the FBI.
I:13417;473;it is a chilling and moving performance.
I:13417;474;The language and violance reflect the true lives of the NY mob.
I:13417;475;See the movie, then read the book.
I:13417;476;Excellent classical soundtrack by composer Patrick Doyle.
I:13417;477;I swear at times watching this movie Pacino and Depp were the charachters and forgot that these superstar actors were acting.
I:13417;478;Mike Madsen plays a tough authentic, believable Boss Sonny Black.
I:13417;479;Director Mike Newell did an incredible job not only directing, but going to the real Little Italy in Manhatten and speaking to real life gangsters to get a real feel of the life that real mobsters lead.
I:13417;480;Newell really did his research on Donnie Brasco, as the result is one fine realistic gangster movie.
I:13417;481;It really took a special person to do what Joe did.
I:13417;482;Donnie Brasco is highly recommended viewing as it is portrayed realistically and authentically.
I:13417;483;This, in my opinion, is the best role he has played to date, and considering his role as Ed Wood, that is something.
I:13417;484;Al Pacino is yet again fantastic as Depp's mentor.
I:13417;485;The support cast includes the extra cool Micheal Madsen.
I:13417;486;The best overall strength of this fine film is it's honesty in de.
I:13417;487;bRASCO also has a touching soundtrack and interesting cinematography, which often mimics surveillance camera work.
I:13417;488;but the best element of this fine film is Al Pacino's role.
I:13417;489;I found it to be an excellent, well.
I:13417;490;I enjoyed the way the movie attempted to understate the level of criminality while reminding us periodically that these are still bad guys ready to step across whatever line we might have been willing to draw in the sand.
I:13417;491;It isn't glamorous but it is filmed in a way that makes it interesting.
I:13417;492;He had a chance to get out and realize his dream.
I:13417;493;One of my husband's favorite movies.
I:13417;494;We enjoyed watching it and I'm sure he will watch it again and again.
I:13417;495;Aside from the Godfather series this may be the best Mafia movie ever made.
I:13417;496;Nobody but Al Pacino could have done Lefty justice and Johnny Depp is fabulous.
I:13417;497;this is definitely worth owning.
I:13417;498;"This is one of the great realist mafia films: you see guys in stalled ""careers"" making bad decisions and desperate to score in order to placate greedy bosses."
I:13417;499;Enter Donnie, who exploits a mark's frustrations and some of the good side of his character, an older man who is willing to mentor him in the ways of the wise guys.
I:13417;500;the acting in this film is truly superb, in particular the chemistry between Pacino and Depp.
I:13417;501;All of the Sopranos characters are three dimensional, and one develops a certain empathy for them, if not admiration of their values.
I:13417;502;They laugh, live, drink, live.
I:13417;503;The movie has a fine cast.
I:13417;504;It's a good freakin' film, fuhgedaboudit!
I:13417;505;"but in ""Donnie Brasco"" we see another group entirely: the middle."
I:13417;506;time, but ambitious, and Pistone/Brasco thinks it's the perfect vehicle with which to launch his infiltration of organized crime.
I:13417;507;Brasco the movie is actually a stand.
I:13417;508;"complimenting ""Goodfellas"" in its depiction of middle."
I:13417;509;Pacino is great as a man who's sure he's facing the end, but is still willing to hold the umbrella for higher bosses.
I:13417;510;But Madsen is also great as Black .
I:13417;511;As real as it gets, the ultimate mafia film based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone.
I:13417;512;Two of Hollywood's great character actors go at it head to head in a life of syndicate crime in the big city, .
I:13417;513;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give outstanding performances as Lefty Ruggiero(Pacino) and Joe Pistone (Depp).
I:13417;514;Pistone's wife is played out brilliantly by Anne Heche, with a fine surrounding supporting cast.
I:13417;515;The film gives the viewer a realistic idea what it takes to survive in the mob and as a law enforcer playing on the inside of a soldier's deadly game.
I:13417;516;A must see and own film,this special edition of DONNIE BRASCO is loaded with extras and an interview with the real Joe Pistone sporting dark shades.
I:13417;517;A lot of the reviews on this page paint the movie in a positive light, and deservedly so.
I:13417;518;If you haven't read the book, then this movie is quite good.
I:13417;519;There's a decent plot, and the producers have stuck to the original story to some extent.
I:13417;520;Al Pacino and Johnny Depp both shine in their respective roles.
I:13417;521;He was proud of what he achieved, and proud of being an FBI agent.
I:13417;522;directed and interesting movie, if quite misleading in quite a few aspects.
I:13417;523;Therefore, it's a solid movie, but not up there with the classics.
I:13417;524;I just loved this movie.
I:13417;525;Al Pacino is terriffic as usual.
I:13417;526;With this movie you enter the mafia world in New York during the 70's and it grows under your skin.
I:13417;527;The script is so good that you'll want to see the movie again and again.
I:13417;528;When this movie was made, Depp was emerging as a truly great actor, alongside the great Al Pacino.
I:13417;529;Al Pacino is as always brillant but what shocked me is just how convincing a display Jonny Depp puts on.
I:13417;530;It is simply the best gangster film around.
I:13417;531;This is a must for all gangster lovers out there!
I:13417;532;Great sound mix.3 stars for the new cut.
I:13417;533;Very intense, honest depiction of the life of a mobster.
I:13417;534;One of the best mob movies.
I:13417;535;Johnny Depp is by far my favorite actor, and his talent as well as his smoldering good looks, shine through in this movie.
I:13417;536;Al Pacino is also marvelous as Lefty.
I:13417;537;Though Al Pacino gives a solid performance, I found the film to be blasse.
I:13417;538;If you like mob movies this one is for you!
I:13417;539;Again, I have to say that this movie is one of the best that I have ever seen.
I:13417;540;My Husband and I will be watching this true story many times over.
I:13417;541;Has too be the best blu.
I:13417;542;Thank you for a great blu.
I:13417;543;This Blu Ray version is considerably better on all levels.
I:13417;544;The slightly muted colors still have a great contrast and color correction creates realistic appearances and skin tones.
I:13417;545;Details can be nicely seen even within the black leather jackets the mobsters all seemed to wear.
I:13417;546;While is this a largely dialogue driven film so you can expect most of your audio to be coming from your center speaker, the front sides do contribute to the infrequent panning of cars.
I:13417;547;The transfer is really quite clean.
I:13417;548;An adaptation of the real life story of a family that gave their all to bring down a major organized crime family.
I:13417;549;A moving, dramatic, and intense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:13417;550;Pacino and Depp are a perfect match for their roles and their talent shines.
I:13417;551;The story is very good and tells about some parts of the mob.
I:13417;552;So which one is more accurate.
I:13417;553;Donnie Brasco is a modern classic.
I:13417;554;The script is realistic, the direction is focused and the sets are atmospheric.
I:13417;555;Is Donnie Brasco a good movie, Fuhget about it.
I:13417;556;If you like Goodfellows you will absolutely love this movie.
I:13417;557;I wanted to see this because of a friend's recommendation.
I:13417;558;It was very well acted.
I:13417;559;I cried at the end of the movie.
I:13417;560;I thought it was one of the best mobster movies made.
I:13417;561;i personally feel that this is one of Al Pacinos finest performances as a mobster.
I:13417;562;You people done good job.
I:13417;563;thank you and keep up the good workTerry T.
I:13417;564;Have seen it before and got for my husband for a gift.
I:13417;565;The film is also surprisingly factually inaccurate in a high preponderance of the particulars.
I:13417;566;With its rich screenplay and strong performances, 'Donnie Brasco' is a good film that ultimately is more about the friendship between two people rather than the mafia.
I:13417;567;He forms a true friendship with Donnie as he tries to gain some altitude back, and as he sees Black getting higher and higher than he does.
I:13417;568;"paul Attanasiano (""Quiz Kids"") based his screenplay on the novel of the same name by the real life Pistone and Richard Wooley."
I:13417;569;There are also some magnetic scenes of drama and brutal violence, especially at a Japanese bar when Donnie doesn't want to take his shoe off.
I:13417;570;While some background characters may seem like the typical mafia lowlifes, the simple characterization of Lefty and Donnie is pure magic.
I:13417;571;"Director Mike Newell, who's previous list of credits include the comedy ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" brings appropriate direction to the film."
I:13417;572;Also very worthy of mention is talented composer Patrick Doyle's musical score, which adds to the emotional effect of many scenes.
I:13417;573;The performances by Pacino and Depp, as usual, are fantastic.
I:13417;574;"Pacino is given a real chance to shine as the aging Lefty, a man unlike his charismatic character in ""The Godfather"" series."
I:13417;575;Depp once again displays his ability to simply submerge himself completely in a role, and as an added bonus the character acts, adding on layers.
I:13417;576;The fresh screenplay, strong acting, and sharp direction make it very worthy of mention and, while it at times gets too slow, or the story sometimes loses focus, it still is a very worthy film of watching.
I:13417;577;Al Pacino + Johnny Depp in a mob drama for the ages.
I:13417;578;It's a classic in my book with an all star cast.
I:13417;579;An exellent movie where the undercover agent Donnie Brasco finds himself trancforming from a investigator to a real life mobster.
I:13417;580;The Departed is newer and better.
I:13417;581;my movie came very fast and was in very good condition.
I:13417;582;Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary movie in many ways.
I:13417;583;But there's so much more to it than that.
I:13417;584;The late 70s period details are impeccably captured, the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic and the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed.
I:13417;585;It's a powerful movie, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking what decisions you would make in the same circumstances.
I:13417;586;An absorbing, well made gangster movie.
I:13417;587;The Godfather is considered the best or one of the best movies of all time (according to online votes at imdb.
I:13417;588;I'd rate the first half of the movie two stars and the last half three to four stars.
I:13417;589;A true story like Donnie Brasco deserves a five.
I:13417;590;The man is a legend with balls of steel.
I:13417;591;The entire cast is as solid as Goodfellas .
I:13417;592;def reveals, but this transfer is excellent.
I:13417;593;The few scenes that seem kind of soft are outweighed by the 99% of beautiful footage.
I:13417;594;I especially enjoyed the extra scenes added back into the film.
I:13417;595;Now I see they actually had tons of footage of his marriage with Anne Heche's character.
I:13417;596;In this case, every bit of it belonged back in the film.
I:13417;597;I regret that I didn't get to see all of that footage on the big screen, but now a high def at home is like having the big screen at your house.
I:13417;598;Like every other reviewer has mentioned Depp, Pacino, Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche make the best cast possible.
I:13417;599;It's a must for any Blu.
I:13417;600;Although the movie differs from the book on a few points, it is still true to the story and tells it with such emotion.
I:13417;601;And I've seen it a few times now.
I:13417;602;If you know anything about this story, the true story this movie could be considered fiction.
I:13417;603;This movie had the potential to be a classic and they blew it.
I:13417;604;Oh yeah, and how about donnie sawing the guys leg off,B. s.
I:13417;605;I loved this movie when it originally came out.
I:13417;606;The casting is spot on and this Blu.
I:13417;607;d movies, but this one is 1.
I:13417;608;This is one of the poorer mob movies, so make sure you give it to someone you don't love.
I:13417;609;Excellent story based on true events!
I:13417;610;Donnie Brasco,a true story of an undercover agent released in 1997 by British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is one of the best.
I:13417;611;Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather Trilogy ranks first, followed by Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.
I:13417;612;I would put this one, starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, in third place.
I:13417;613;This was a great movie, but if you've read the book, you'll know that it was dramatized quite a bit.
I:13417;614;It is still a little informative on the Mafia, and it is a good movie unto itself.
