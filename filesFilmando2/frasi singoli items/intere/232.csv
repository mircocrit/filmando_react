id;spiegazione
1;First time seeing Marilyn and Jane Russell (together!)
2;It is representative of the period!
3;Spectacular song/dance scenes including the famous 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'.
4;good movie, get it used.
5;Absolutely hilarious, with a good bit of romance, and some very catchy songs.
6;MArylin was an underrated actress, everyone knows about her bnatural assets, but she was a terrific actress that had IT.
7;She was a star crossed person, who lived life to the fullest.
8;These showgirls have one thing on their minds and that is to find love and money.
9;Lorelie (Monroe) uses her nave innocence and stunning looks to place men under her spell.
10;Dorothy ( Russell ) is up to the same the tricks but is more outspoken, she just loves to play the game.
11;When these two showgirls work together men do not stand a chanceLorelie and Dorothy set sail aboard an upscale cruise ship for France with the intention to find love, money, diamonds, or even better all three.
12;Malone has trouble of his own
13;in a short 92 minutes we are entertained by both comedy and music.
14;The soundtrack really adds to the movie as we hear classics like
15;This is a great example of the innocent and subtle comedy of the fifties, I give this movie 4 stars.
16;I loved Monroe and found her shtick phenomenally layered in most of her films, but this is one of her weaker moments.
17;She is completely upstaged by a much deeper and well rounded Russell, who makes so much out of a film that is about as dense as it comes.
18;The plot is predictable and clich d, and the script doesn't really add any depth to the proceedings, but in the end it is enjoyable fluff and it does hit the comedic marks rather well.
19;This one is certainly iconic (the name is more recognizable than the film itself), thanks in large part to the star turns by the two bodacious leads
20;If you are a Marilyn Monroe fan or not this is a great movie!
21;It's one of my all time favorites.
22;as long as they are rich, because her first love is the diamond in any form she can get her hands on it!
23;She works with her bestfriend Dorothy ( Jane Russell) as a top musical act and has sung and danced her way into the heart of a young millionaire.
24;monroe's classic Diamonds are a Girl's Bestfriend is a highlight of this movie in the Diamond Collection.
25;But my favorite is Russell's Anyone Here for Love.
26;This movie is a gem for anyone who loves the older musicals!
27;This is one of my favorite classics!
28;I can watch it over and over and I do!
29;This movie is fun, silly, lighthearted and well produced.
30;The actors did a fantastic job of portraying their characters in an interesting, unique fashion.
31;I enjoy this film because it brings a refreshing, joyous attitude to travel and reminds me to have fun in life.
32;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell look absolutely glamorous in this production, their costumes immaculately designed.
33;The writers also did a great job of making the movie funny, and not just for the year it was produced.
34;I am thirty years old and I completely understand the humor.
35;I found it to be somewhat universal.
36;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals, and desires a short vacation from life and reality television.
37;A Great Singer and Dancer.
38;Wonderful Songs and Musical Numbers.
39;There are much better movies with the same people to be had.
40;pure color and very good songs and dances.
41;Thess two ladies are gone now , but they sure made good films.
42;Not a work of art, but alot of fun, Gentleman Prefer Blondes is one of those movies that is great to curl up with on a rainy day.
43;A comedy with lots of song and dance numbers that show off Marilyn Monroe Jane Russell to best effect, it is the story of two nightclub performers from Little Rock who set out to snag themselves millionaire husbands.
44;jinx, Loralei using her abundant charms to try and entice a rich industrialist to part with his diamonds, and Dorothy dueling with the private detective hired by Loralei's fiancee to keep an eye on her.
45;The usual mishaps ensue, and it all ends happy as would be expected, so don't expect a brain workout, but it is an enjoyable vehicle for the two stars, with lavish costuming and sets all in glorious 1950's colour
46;And of course, there's that classic Monroe moment .
47;the Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend number, which shows Marilyn at her glamourous, iconically beautiful best.
48;But it's a LITTLE bit entertaining.
49;This is another of the videos of the early 20th century.
50;Some among us love the old classics.
51;You can see the color of her eyes as well as her lipstick glistening from the lights.
52;Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend is 100 times clearer and the audio sounds as if it was recorded yesterday.
53;This movie is highly entertaining, with great musical numbers with the shining Marilyn Monroe and the great Jane Russel.
54;The opening is grand, with the two entering with shiny red gowns singing Two Little Girls from Littlerock .
55;Other extremely entertaining songs are the catchy Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend and Is there Anyone here for Love?
56;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russel are wonderful.
57;Jane Russel is beautiful and Marylin Monroe is hilarious as a girl who practically will do anything for diamonds.
58;It is a funny movie that you will enjoy.
59;I tend to go for films with weightier themes than this one, generally, but Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is so frothy, lovely, fun, and lively that it's impossible not to enjoy.
60;Rarely has an actress lit up the screen so completely
61;marilyn is just so right on, so cuddly and cute, curvaceously sexy yet sweet, evilly money.
62;She presents herself here as the alpha woman.
63;This film is literally the only time I've ever looked at extras and thought how wonderful it would have been to just share the set with the star for a day.
64;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the dictionary definition of lightweight Hollywood musical, in which the leading ladies and their verve carries the day all by themselves.
65;Just an amazing, funny, witty, and musical movie.
66;The Women: Two beautiful showgirls on a cruise to France.
67;They are exact opposites in personality, goals, and, most importantly, hair color.
68;One's on the hunt for a rich husband, the other is in search of true love.
69;the Men: One's filthy rich and pretty much his father's puppet.
70;The other is a detective hired by above mentioned rich father to find dirt on the showgirl his son is so determined to marry.
71;the Story: Romance is in the air, a whole Olympic team is on board, and two beauties are on the prowl.
72;It tingles my toes and tickles my nose and makes me giddy with delight everytime.
73;Lorelei Lee is just about the smartest girl I ever met.
74;And her friend Dorothy is nice too.
75;I've always loved Marilyn Monroe 
76;This has been one of my favorite movies since it was a little girl.
77;GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is a wonderful and entertaining comedy that does not miss a bit in pure enjoyment.
78;howard Hawk's direction glistens with spirit and finesse.
79;Each song is jubilant and well staged.
80;jane Russell is along for the ride and acts as a conscience and quasi big sister for MM.
81;For the 50's of the Lucy era,the film is quite illuminating in its tones of implied sexuality in the costumes emphasizing ample cleavage and the voluptuous hips of Monroe and Russell.
82;The Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend number(first performed by Monroe and then parodied by Russell disguised as Monroe in front of a French Judge and his court staff is hilarious and daring for its time).
83;hawks,Wilder, Hitchcock, and many other directors of that period found ways to introduce adult themes thru family fare that was evocative,fun and entertaining for the whole family.
84;this film is a must have for a classic movie viewing evening.
85;based on the Broadway hit by Anita Loos and directed by Howard Hawks, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is a veritable showcase for its two leading stars, and is simply one of the most entertaining musical comedies of all time.
86;Both ladies look absolutely stunning in those lush, '50's era Technicolor tones which are fully captured in Fox's fabulous Blu.
87;Marilyn's most iconic number, Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend, is a showstopper to be sure, and here it sparkles with a clarity that'll knock your socks off.
88;gENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is one of those movies that just seems to hit the spot at each viewing.
89;It's sheer fun, and it captures that happy, carefree spirit of the '50's in a way few films do.
90;This movie is my favorite movie of all time, and believe meI have a HUGE collection.
91;one other thing that makes this movie stand out is a little boy,Mr. Spofford the 3rd, who is absolutely hilarious and in myopinion almost steals the show from Marilyn and Jane.
92;This movie is a delight!
93;I have to say this a great movie!
94;On the way there they enjoy the company of any eligible men they can find including the Olympic team.
95;This movie has a lot of great music including Bye Bye Baby, Ain't There Anyone Here for Love, When Love Goes Wrong, Two Little Girls from Little Rock, and the famous and legendary Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend.
96;The costumes in this movie are awesome.
97;Marilyn and Jane made a really great duo.
98;This movie is a real gem!
99;This is a real classic.
100;These 2 ladies are great.
101;i watch every movie they make.
102;this movie is a total guilty pleasure.
103;The catchy musical sequences, the stylish dialogues, and the glamourous outfits make this movie an irresistably sexy treat.
104;Then when she falls for a man, there is a wonderful conflict.
105;interest between her romance versus her loyalty to her best friend.
106;That may be the greatest novelty of all: female bonding on screen.
107;The relationship with these ladies reminds me more of the women I know in real life.
108;Always loved the chemistry between the two women in this movie.
109;Where else can you find two stacked women who outsmart everyone and stay loyal to their friendship all through the movie.
110;The musical numbers are a lot of fun.
111;and Diamonds are a Girl's Best friend is iconic, both as a sentiment and as a visual.
112;one thing I do wonder.
113;diamonds are NOT especially valuable
114;and physical gold, not certificates.
115;My daughter is such a Marilyn Monroe fan and movie buff.
116;This was a perfect gift for her.Your availabilty on old movies is great.
117;I got myself An affair to Remember my personal fav with Cary Grant &Deborah Carr.
118;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell work astonishingly well together in this movie.
119;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is very lush, glamorous, colorful and glitzy.
120;Russell is so witty and almost steals Monroe's thunder.
121;The costumes are gorgeous, the acting is comedic and the scenery is just beautiful.
122;The best part is obviously when Marilyn performs Diamonds are a girl's bestfriend and what a great performer she is!
123;Russell is more than impressive with her performance of Ain't there anyone hear for love.
124;Old Hollywood at it's very best!
125;I really enjoyed this movie.
126;The fashion is amazing and so are the music numbers.
127;She was such a beautiful and talented actress!
128;Marilyn Monroe is the best in this film!
129;digging blonde, who still manages to have some brains and sensibility.
130;Together with Jane Russell, these two are quite the comedic duo.
131;this film is perfect for any afternoon when you need your spirit lifted.
132;Carefree comedy and fun songs make this movie enjoyable!And of course, it has Marilyn's most famous song: Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend!
133;I worked at the local theater in my home town when I was in high school, and this was one of the movies that I remember enjoying so much.
134;Gentlemen Prefer BlondesI love old movies and this is a great addition.
135;The dancing and singing are great.
136;I love the 50s era this is classic 50s Marilyn Monroe is great in this movie and so is jane Russell a perfect match it shipped very quick I haven't seen the yet so please don't ruin it for me
137;the opening number, Little Girl From Little Rock, is actually a snappy pleasant number featuring both Lorelei and Dorothy in the long red.
138;the set designs for the Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend number, with the bright red and black motifs, and the tuxedoed men with candy.
139;cane ties wielding diamonds, the women in pink dresses, and of course La Monroe herself is THE highlight in this film, and worth watching for it alone.
140;digging attitude, there are some moments of cuteness and wit,When Gus tells her what a letter of credit is, Lorelei says, That's wonderful.
141;Be sure and write me everyday.
142;I've gotta admit that Marilyn is simply stunning in this picture.
143;jane Russell (Dorothy) plays the loyal sidekick with a rapier wit, not as good as Eve Arden, but good enough.
144;other great dialogue comes from the Olympians making a veiled remark on the womens' anatomy.
145;Hey Steve, suppose the ship got hit by an iceberg.
146;Oooohh, good one, Steve!The initial feature is a brief Movietone newsreel with Monroe and Russell putting their sigs and handprints in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
147;as a musical comedy of the 1950's, the peak of the conformist, materialistic America, it serves as a time capsule of attitudes.
148;In Lorelei and Dorothy, we also see the two values of the times embodied.
149;I can best sum this up that it comes alive with the snazzy musical numbers, particularly the opening one and of course Diamonds.
150;I love this film for more reasons than I count.
151;More importantly, this film is Marilyn's first musical, and she and her voice acquit themselves very well indeed.
152;The cast is terrific, the humor is genuine and abundant, and Marilyn absolutely steals the show from her brunette counterpart Jane Russell (even though Russell was paid far, far more than Marilyn for her role in the film).
153;Things get pretty wild toward the end, but naturally all the major players are reunited in the end.
154;marilyn is divine as the blonde, acquisitive Lorelei Lee, and it could be said that she was never lovelier than she was in this movie.
155;Her attempts to set Dorothy up with a rich man on the ship backfire when her chosen Mr. Right ends up being a little boy, but Mr. Henry Spofford III (George Winslow) adds some unforgettable laughs to the mix.
156;gentlemen Prefer Blondes boasts of a number of great songs, barreling right out of the gates with Marilyn and Russell singing A Little Girl From Little Rock.
157;Bye Bye Baby is an impressive and rather elaborate number, Russell's performance of the song Ain't There Anyone Here for Love to the backdrop of the U. s. Olympic team is quite memorable, and the Monroe.
158;russell number When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right is fantastic and really shows Monroe's comfort level with her singing and dancing.
159;i don't consider Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to be Marilyn's best movie, but I would recommend it as the starting point to those yet to glimpse the power and beauty of the Goddess.
160;This is probably one of my very favorite Marilyn Monroe movies
161;ray looks amazing
162;The details are fantastic, too
163;The sound works just fine for a movie of its age
164;Just clear sound that highlights the vocals of Marilyn and Jane Russell perfectly.
165;Dorothy is single, and Lorelei is tied to a nerdy man (played perfectly by Tommy Noonan) worth millions.
166;a number of memorable musical numbers by Russell (Anyone Here For Love?)
167;These two make a great combo, as you can really feel a genuine friendship with their on.
168;Highly recommended as one of Marilyn's most entertaining movies!
169;Great dancing, great music, and buff men!
170;Howard Hawks was a true magician since it was hard .
171;to avoid of being vulgar, offensive or morbid while telling the story of two women who are in love with men: one because she loves rich men and one because she loves handsome and sinewy men.
172;however this movie isn't just a proof of the ability of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors: this is the triumph of Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell since they appear as beautiful women and skilled actresses, furthermore they are supported by a good cast of characters .
173;The audio is clear and brilliant .
174;in my opionion this is one of the best track realized from a movie of the 50's .
175;while the video presents vigorous colors and sharp detail.
176;This moving is amazing, and the plot is hilarious.
177;Marilyn and Jane make a great pair especially with the musicals.
178;because best doesn't always mean the best written, the best story or the best anything.
179;it means I, audience member found this movie so enjoyable that I could watch it over and over again.
180;(I'm sure I've watched it almost 20 times)This movie is dazzling in wit and diamonds.
181;And then the dynamic duo of Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell .
182;Their numbers are superb, their comic timing sadly missing today in movies.
183;Madonna is queen of videoland, but Marilyn can hold my attention for a full two hours!I know some women who disagree with me, but I think Marilyn is one of the most beautiful visual creations of all time.
184;gentlemen Prefer Blonds should be every girls best friend!
185;Something the whole family could watch and enjoy.
186;she played the part well.
187;The harmony was very good, for 2 actresses that were not known as singers.
188;This movie with Marilyn Monroe was the best!
189;It is my favorite movie with her in it.
190;Although, How to marry a millionaire was a good movie too.
191;I would have to say this is my favorite movie with her because I first saw this movie in the Turner Classic Movie channel a while ago and I ever since I saw it, I wanted to see it again.
192;This was an excellent movie for a good price.
193;The fabulous, iconic Marylin Monroe.
194;Which ensures great musical numbers to dazzle you throughout the film!
195;Monroe's sultry and breathy voice is sure to sparkle straight through, and is quite the comedic relief.
196;And Russell has some great one.
197;liners and carries the drama through.
198;not my favorite Marylin, but one of the top 2.
199;If you're a Monroe or Russell fan I would highly recommend this movie.
200;I love it and can't wait to watch it again!
201;Russell and Monroe are exceptional in this movie.
202;But still a cute movie.
203;This was the film that catapulted Marilyn Monroe to fame and top stardom, and she looks just great and is very good as gold (or better say diamond) digging Lorelei Lee, especially in the now classic Diamonds are a girl's best friend number, but Jane Russell is just equally excellent as Marilyn Monroe's down.
204;earth, warm and sincere pal, Dorothy.
205;russell shines all the way, in excellent musical numbers with Monroe, as well as by herself, like in the sexy Ain't There Anyone Here for Love, sung on a gym onboard a Cruise, surrounded by the american olympic men (drill) team, exercising as she sings.
206;In fact, the most hilarious sequence in the movie, which made me laugh really loud, was the courtroom scene, where Russell (with a blonde wig) impersonated her friend Lorelei, with truly exhilarating results!
207;And, the comic, nuclear bombshell that devestated all men in her path, as in her earlier roles.
208;This film perfectly embodies all the qualities of the latter, and, to many, remains her definitive role.
209;She is amazingly incandescent, and a natural comic, as Lorelei Lee, the not so dumb gold.
210;digger with a penchant for diamonds.
211;This film may not be politically correct, I don't think Gloria Steinem is ever going to like it, but, in the context of the story, and the time in which it was made, it is entertainingly funny, and visually, a knock.
212;This was the role which made her a star, and she took everyone, including Fox head Darryl Zanuck, by surprise, with her comic panache and singing ability.
213;takingly gorgeous in this role, but has a comic delivery which, for all her reported problems on set, is beyond comparison, save for perhaps Judy Holliday.
214;And her big finale, Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend, remains a classic musical moment in cinema.
215;Jane Russell, who was immensely generous to the comparative newcomer Marilyn, spoke lovingly of her then, and does to this day.
216;Try and forget the dated aspects of this film, and just enjoy the sumptuous beauty and natural comic genius of Marilyn Monroe, Hollywoods greatest legend.
217;This film is a true classic and highlights the amazing Marilyn Monroe.
218;The songs are so delightful and have entered the realm of history, especially Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend which will always be associated with Marilyn Monroe and one of the iconic songs of the century.
219;There will never be as talented an actress as she.
220;Russell and Monroe and supporting cast deliver a lighthearted movie.
221;While it will never compete with the likes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, GIGI, or MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, this 1953 confection is nonetheless a real charmer.
222;blonde bombshell Loreli Lee, who is determined to marry for money, and brunette beauty Dorothy Shaw, who prefers to marry for love.
223;The story is traditional fluff, pure and simple, and there is nothing in the least innovative or unexpected about the film as a whole.
224;but it is all extremely, extremely well done.
225;the score is bright, including such tunes as the famous Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend .
226;and all the musical numbers are cleverly staged and filmed.
227;The overall look of the film is also eye popping: the ladies are dressed to perfection and the color cinematography is truly joyous.
228;The script is full of comfortable wit, director Hawks keeps it moving at a nice clip, and the cast includes such enjoyable performers as Charles Coburn, Tommy Noonan, Norma Varden, and George Winslow.
229;monroe and Russell have remarkable chemistry on screen, and although neither were really singers they each had enjoyable and very distinctive singing voices
230;Both also had a way with comedy, with Monroe offering her quintessential 'not so dumb blonde' and Russell matching her all the way as the wise.
231;And so well do they work together it is hard to pick a favorite between the two.
232;Thoroughly enjoyable for any one still capable of a smile.
233;Bemused said to seeing me everything was great.
234;Would totally recommend this movie to anyone.
235;Diamonds are a girls best friend musical piece is in here and it is great.
236;Compare this movie to so many other Hollywood films during the 1930's and 1940's.
237;It's quite true that in those films women might be running a corporation or making scientific discoveries or flying airplanes, but at the conclusion of the movie they are supposed to gush and say what they really miss is being in love with a man.
238;George Cukor's 1939 movie The Women is an example of this genre.
239;She is going to be Delilah to any man that crosses her path.
240;In fact, the man she intends to marry is effeminate and an easy push.
241;but she also likes being in control, the one who wears the pants.
242;contrary to some of her other roles, let's say Some Like it Hot, she is actually very bright.
243;In other words, she feels she earned it and takes a strong stance over her personal property.
244;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell singing and dancing and looking for love.
245;Marilyn as 'Lorelei Lee' is one of her best performances.
246;Although she is playing a gold digger, she really is looking for a true love (just one with money!
247;The big performance of Marilyn singing 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' is wonderful.
248;She does a perfect job as 'Lorelei's' best friend.
249;All actors worked well in bringing together a very funny, loving feature film.
250;A great starter film for people interested in Marilyn, Jane, musicals or old Hollywood.
251;This is one of my favorite Marilyn movies.
252;ray disc and was surprised at how much better it is.
253;Hands down this is so much better.
254;ray are really nice in this movie.
255;Nothing fancy, just good old fashioned stereo.
256;If you like Marilyn and or Jane I say go ahead and get this, I'm sure you will see the difference.
257;Yup, it`s her film and she shines all through it.
258;As a musical production it isn`t up to much compared what they did over at Metro.
259;jane Russell does hold her own and Charles Coburn is a delight as well.
260;is great entertainment with Vera working as decoy for Lorre and Von Stroheim as a Countess Tanya Vronsky.
261;she lures rich bachelors of money and jewelry and the film(a remake of a 1938.
262;film)is full of excellent 1.
263;With great musical numbers, hooty costumes.
264;It's interesting to see how much movies got away with in the oppressive 50's as evidenced in the quite sexy number with Ms. Russell and the scantily clad males from the U. S. Olympic Team, her fellow travelers on the boat trip to Paris.
265;This movie is now over 50 years old and will remain a classic.
266;Another classic MM movie with Jane Russell also.
267;love the movies from this time.
268;This funny and entertaining musical just might be Marilyn Monroe's best movie.
269;In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monroe and costar Jane Russell are superb.
270;In this heartwarming, classic comedy, two showgirls are sent on a luxury cruise ship to France.
271;On the way, love is put to the test, and both women are dead set in finding the man they are destined to be with.
272;Jane Russell is a genius as the brunette brain of the pair, and Monroe captures the viewers heart with her childlike beauty and innocence.
273;If you are in the mood for a heartwarming, comedic love story, this is the film for you.
274;You'll be captivated by two of the greatest actresses that we have had the privilege of watching on the big screen.
275;They are both gorgeous and dress very well.
276;Parts of it a nice, particulary the musical numbers.
277;But, once seen, it will fade from the viewer's mind with surprising ease.
278;If you like musicals you will enjoy this!
279;A true classic and I love classics!!!!
280;Marilyn was great in this movie.
281;Even tough I'm a huge music and film lover.
282;Marilyn Monroe never called my attention and the first time that I saw one of her movies was in 2002 when I saw How to marry a millionaire and found it very good and funny.
283;this movie is fresh and funny.
284;the movie contains several musical numbers including the classic song Diamonds are a girl's best friend .
285;This is the absolute best, without a question, best Marilyn Monroe movie.
286;Excellent, funny, extremely well acted classic!
287;Even if you aren't a musical or Marilyn Monroe lover you'll be highly entertained!
288;It's one of my favorite movies.
289;This is a great movie for classic lovers, musical lovers, and Baby boomers.
290;My favorite number is with MM singing Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend.
291;It's upbeat, great song and dance routines and light humor.
292;Even the good musicals of today usually have a message .
293;She sings, she dances, she has her one.
294;like laugh are other Marilyn trademarks that her fans love so much.
295;The costumes, the songs, the gags, they all make this movie a joy to watch.
296;Deserves five stars for the song Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.
297;Marilyln Monroe's performance was about 200 stars, the rest of the movie average at best.
298;Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe are a delightful example that you don't have to be a stick to be sexy.
299;It's a fun musical you will want to watch again and again.
300;This is one of the most charming movies starring Marilyn, and her portrayal of Lorelei Lee is the dumb blonde archetype for all the ages.
301;be Marilyn in the similar dress from her video Material Girl was a wonderful homage to pay to the original Marilyn.
302;With songs like Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, and Little Rock, and a terrific supporting performance by Jane Russell, this is one of my all.
303;We all know that she was Norma Jean Baker, a very troubled, but very smart, sensitive, talented woman.
304;Bus Stop, The Misfits, The Prince and the Showgirl, all show her growth and depth as an artist.
305;But, Gentleman Prefer Blondes is the best showcase for that wonderful creation Marilyn Monroe.
306;She just glows in this film.
307;Each scene captures the innocence, exaggerated sexiness and child.
308;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend is classic Marilyn, and a truly delightful highlight of this enjoyable movie.
309;time musical moments on film.
310;Just the 20th logo and then Marilyn and Jane in outrageous red dresses singing and dancing Two Little Girls from Little Rock .
311;so much fun that it makes the credits difficult to sit through in the theater (where I saw it, of course, more than once) until the girls come back to finish their number.
312;If I had to pick one of Marilyn's lines from this film, it is when one of the athletes on board boasts to her that he is a four.
313;Then she does what actors are told not to do, she turns her back on her audience and walks rapidly away!
314;It's fun to watch and picture are excellent.
315;Its funny and has wonderful songs.
316;I also really liked that little boy who finds Marilyn stuck in a window!
317;Jane and Marilyn show us the beauty of Hollywood of the past.
318;Easily one of Marilyn Monroe's best movies!
319;The costumes are beautiful and the song numbers make the show a delight to watch!
320;Definitely a must have in the collection.
321;A timeless classic that I love to watch again and again.
322;I truly believe that Gentlemen prefer Blonds is one of the best comedies of all time.
323;Every scene in this film is a Rembrant!
324;This film contains the finest musical numbers, the finest comical acting, and by far this film has an array of the finest actors the world has ever known.
325;Sub titles are no fun.
326;The Old Moneybags Dad of Marilyn Monroe's fiance sure gets a jolt when she drops that line, but it's all in a day's work for this self.
327;respecting queen of the golddiggers in this delightful movie.
328;The difference between the two ladies' approaches to love and men is shown up best in their separate showstoppers.
329;This fun piece of fluff is well worth your time for the title song alone.
330;Her diamond fetish creates loads of trouble for her and friend Dorothy (Jane Russell) and loads of fun for us.
331;She was a comic genious, still vastly underrated by many.
332;Very entertaining film for it's time.
333;Many great character actors and the headliners don't disappoint.
334;Marilyn Monroe is definitely one of the most oversexed and typecasted actresses of all time but that can't change the fact that she was the best at what she did!
335;This movie is one of my favorite Marilyn movies of all time and Jane Russell was the perfect actress to play Marilyn's friend.
336;provoking and metaphorical then look elsewhere but if you're looking for a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously then Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the right movie for you!
337;This is a great movie to watch.
338;The music is great and has some good twist.
339;I love watching this movie, it always brightens up my day!
340;I must say that I loved this movie.
341;It is the first movie I've seen with Marilyn Monroe.
342;Both she and Jane Russell were the most pleasant and beautiful in this movie.
343;Marilyn and Jayne are marvelous in this fun and silly movie.
344;I love all the wonderful songs and music.
345;Always has been, always will be, a truly phenomenal movie.
346;But Marilyn is so adorable and Jane Russell is so much fun to watch as her breezy, fun.
347;loving friend Dorothy that you can't resist.
348;glamorous 50's clothes and costumes alone are worth watching.
349;While I must confess that for Monroe this probably was her starmaking role, Russell really shines in the role of Dorothy, who inevitably must play Ethel to Marilyn Monroe's Lucy.
350;this movie is famous for the Diamonds are a girl's best Friend number that Monroe did and Madonna copied in her Material Girl video.
351;Hopefully she will be the subject of one of the box set tribute collections.
352;in short, this movie is a pure delight and well worth repeated watchings.
353;It is worth the price of admission to see two great stars at the height of their powers.
354;There are no movies better than the classics.
355;acts them all in the terrific movie.
356;This wonderful glittering gem of a movie is a Technicolor showcase for the eye.
357;filling talents of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe as showgirls on the prowl aboard a luxury liner and later in Paris.
358;Charles Coburn is a delight as an old rapscallion Monroe takes a liking to because of his diamond mine and a tiara that belongs to his wife that she cons him out of.
359;He's so smitten with her that he's utterly charming.
360;Monroe and Russell are a formidable duo and the film is completely delightful from start to finish.
361;The costumes by Travilla are stunning as well.
362;A kiss on the handMay be quite continental,But diamonds are a girl's best friend.
363;diamonds are a girl's best friend.
364;he's your guyWhen stocks are high,But beware when they start to descend.
365;diamonds are a girl's best friend.
366;gentlemen Prefer Blondes gave Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell the perfect opportunity to showcase their numerous talents.
367;When Marilyn and Jane dance to some of these numbers their beauty and talent strike the viewer as incredible.
368;Tommy Noonan turns in a strong and convincing performance as Gus Esmond, the American man who wants to marry Lorelei, who is played by Marilyn Monroe.
369;Charles Coburn and Norma Varden perform as Sir Francis 'Piggy' Beekman and Lady Beekman, super rich people who got their wealth from diamond mining in South Africa.
370;The crisp, clear color reflects the hard work to restore this movie and the sound is excellent, too!
371;Jule Styne and Leo Robin provide wonderful music and lyrics for the classic songs in this picture.
372;The ship carries a male Olympic relay team and they certainly attract Dorothy's attention.
373;His wife, Lady Beekman, travels with him.
374;the scenes in Paris offer stunning backdrops and a wonderful idea of what Paris looked like in the early 1950s.
375;Lorelei performs the unforgettable song and dance number Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend with male back up dancers.
376;watch this movie and see for yourselves!Marilyn Monroe fans will thrill to this great picture and Jane Russell fans will enjoy it just as much.
377;People who enjoy musical comedies will also like this picture.
378;Marylin Monroe is one of the best actresses in hollywood history.
379;This is one of her most notable and famed movies.
380;She has always been overrated in my opinion.
381;My wife is a huge Marilyn Monroe fan, and this is her favorite movie of all time.
382;It's pretty risque for 1953, and the musical numbers are great.
383;Jane Russell's big number, is gayer than a Christmas tree, and Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend is one of Marilyn's finest moments.
384;She's absolutely radiant throughout this movie, and very funny too.
385;Her talents were overshadowed by her looks, and this is her best performance in my opinion.
386;The film print has been restored, and looks great, I love Technicolor movies from this period.
387;In this classic movie musical, Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell star as two entertainers and best girlfriends who embark on a ship to Paris in search of the perfect men.
388;This is a funny movie with some good musical numbers, including Monroe's iconic Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend routine.
389;Marlyn shows here why she was a star and her signing and dancing is at top form.
390;This is still a good time for classic movies buffs.
391;there is much subtle comedy to discover, watch the timing of how talented people work a script.
392;Arguably, along with the 'Seven Year Itch', this lighthearted 50's musical comedy is the most definitive 'Marilyn' film.
393;marilyne is just so funny and cute as the wide eyed, but gold digging, 'Lorelei', the supposed 'Dumb Blonde' who knows what she wants however, and why.
394;She undoubtedly brings a lot of energy to the role, and the camaraderie and chemistry they deliver as a pair contribute much to the films charm and success.
395;there are several very entertaining 'showgirl' type musical numbers throughout.
396;Sooo cute when she refers to the ship's portals as 'round windows' and innocently tries on a diamond tiara around her neck.
397;Then, at the end justifies and explains her money driven ways to her finance's contemtuous Father,in the most surprisingly clever way.
398;Pure 'Marilyn' in all her pure, unique celluloid magic!
399;Way to funny and the music is just phenomenal.
400;Definitely the best of Marilyn Monroe in my opinion.
401;i saw this movie for the first time just a few short weeks ago and i'm hooked!
402;i always wondered what the appeal of marilyn was, but after watching this movie, i understand completely.
403;she has that perfect mix of sexuality and innocence that make her irresistable.
404;it is a very smart comedy that is a blast to watch.
405;take it from a college student and first time fan of these two ladies, they still got what it takes after all these years!
406;Terrific film that still shines as brightly as it did in 1953!
407;You'll enjoy, especially if it's your first time viewing, and you'll enjoy even if it's your one hundredth viewing!
408;This is by far one of my favorite musicals.
409;Marilyn and Jane Russell are amazing and in great form.
410;Its funny, well written, well acted and the musical score is fun and catchy.
411;Marilyn was at her comedic best and ever so beautiful.
412;A flawless face an amazing body and Diamonds, what more is there to ask for in a movie?
413;With all seriousness, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a hoot!
414;Its fun and gay and full of innocent laughs without having to swear or show nudity.
415;This is one of the classics of Marylin Monroe.
416;The whole movie is a lot of fun to watch.
417;Yesterday's sex symbol actually has more class than a lot of today's girls.
418;But I have really enjoyed watching her and Jane Russell in this movie.
419;Funny, fun and at the end a rather surprising speech from Marilyn made it even better and supplied a perfect ending.
420;I really liked this movie.
421;romantic comedies are my favorite genre.
422;the movie arrived in very good condition.
423;I will enjoy watching this movie with my friends and family.
424;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell are terrific together.
425;Lots of music, and great comedic skills from both of these stars.
426;This movie GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES , is so enjoyable, it neverlet's you down.
427;Andplease include Marilyn's poem I once knew a man called Sidney.
428;Her singing is most enjoyable.
429;And to Jayne Russell, to quotefrom the movie,  Dorothy, you were also good.
430;Fun classic movie,has it all, silly situations, some wisdom, laughs great clothes and sets, two classic actors.
431;Although it may be a bit generic, dumb blond Marilyn she does add good comedic value to the movie.
432;Marilyn and Jane are beautiful, funny and sexy!
433;My daughter and I loved watching old musicals.
434;This is her very favorite!
435;In death, as in life, the legend of Marilyn Monroe endures as one of the most instantly recognisable images of popular culture.
436;She is an Icon, representing numerous things to us all .
437;sex appeal, classic Hollywood, frailty, tragedy, and womanhood .
438;put simply, this is Monroe's finest comedy hour.
439;sharp Lorelei Lee, a gold.
440;The scene is set for possibly one of Hollywood's greatest ever musical comedies.
441;Russell is the perfect foil to Monroe, both visually and vocally .
442;voiced Dorothy is the polar opposite of the pink and fluffy Lorelei, and the pair have wonderful on.
443;is a wonderful illustration of the powerful contrast between these two actresses.
444;Monroe and Russell play their parts with conviction and gusto .
445;the score of the movie also deserves a special mention, as it's as important as any of the players.
446;he allows the starlets free reign of the screen, and it pays off with dividends.
447;good kind of musical that you'll remember always.
448;It's simple, flashy, funny, and completely entertaining.
449;Jane Russell's lack of ego and Monroe's sense of fun meshed perfectly when they co. starred in Anita Loos' light.
450;She comes into the film looking like a winner, and leaves as one.
451;her personality infuses every corner of the film as if she has even picked the scenery to work for her.
452;So the movie rises above its pretext, its story, its existence as a musical, even its music, and becomes at its best a magic work, yet it is a comic bubble without weight or solemnity, another piece of spun sugar come up out of everything banal in entertainment.
453;but Marilyn remains a great comedian, a sexual delight, especially when she sang Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
454;The film crowned Monroe in her position as the nation's new 'Love Goddess' with the promise of many sparkling hits to come, and Jane Russell's career continued, with less fanfare, but very successfully for several more years.
455;a Classic Song and Two Classic Women make this a wonderful film!
456;I thought that this was a good movie because it was very funny and well casted.
457;The casts singing, acting and dancing were great.
458;But overall this was a good classic Marilyn Monroe movie.
459;While Marilyn Monroe was, in my opinion, never a great actress she does a good job in this role which almost seems to have been written for her (it wasn't, it was a stage play first).
460;Jane Russell is, as always, gorgeous and serves as the perfect companion for Marilyn.
461;This film is funny, entertaining and well worth watching.
462;This is a good movie, and fun to watch.
463;The blue ray is tops, as is the sound.
464;The price is OK, and I think most people will be glad to add this to their blue ray collection.
465;I love Marlyn Monroe and Jane Russell two of the sexy.
466;They made women look like women and they truly put the umph in sexiness!!!!
467;MARILYN IS MAGNIFICENTThis movie is fun to watch and Russell and Monroe are a perfect pair.
468;The inclusion of those two cute little African boys dancing with the girls is a pleasant surprise considering rampant racism that defined the uptight 50's.
469;day impersonator such as Madonna ( Material Girl ) is to appreciate all the more the inimitable vibrancy of the original.
470;This film joins Billy Wilder's brilliant comedy, Some Like It Hot, as one of her 2 indispensable movies.
471;Marilyn and Jane are fantastic in their roles.
472;wonderful film from yesterday's film production.
473;fun, romance and great musical numbers by two of the greats in movies.
474;do yourself a favour and have a great evening watching this Blu.
475;This is a dazzling and colorful romp starring two of the most popular sex symbols of the time, Jane Russell, (Dorothy) and Marilyn Monroe, (Loreli).
476;They both work so well together in this film and they compliment each other perfectly!
477;In between, we have some fun musical numbers that show off the singing and dancing talents of both of the stars.
478;a brief summary of the plot has Dorothy looking for love, and Loreli looking for men with rocks, (diamonds), while on a voyage to Europe.
479;One of Marilyn's lines, A kiss on the hand is all very nice but a diamond tiara lasts longer still cracks me up!
480;charles Colburn is also around for the fun, as a randy, married millionaire who's infatuated with Loreli.
481;this film is complete escapist fare, but it's sure to put a big smile on your face!
482;it's much more than that, it's a light romantic comedy with Marylin and Jane Russel finding their ideal and millionaire husbands.
483;Most of the action occurs in a cruise in the Atlantic also with old Charles Coburn delivering good moments with both girls.
484;In fact I conly count one or two really funny sequences, while other Marylin's movs have non.
485;stop gags.Yet watch it, if you want to enjoy beautiful Marylin and Jane and some nice mov!
486;Gentleman Prefer Blondes (1953) is a breezy musical.
487;comedy directed with stylish verve by none other than Howard Hawks.
488;Marilyn's sparkling rendition of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend remains among the Great Movie Moments.
489;Charles Coburn and the inimitable George Foghorn Winslow provide memorable support.
490;A Technicolor trifle with plenty of star power.
491;great treatment for this fabulous classic.
492;the costumes in the film are divine, however.
493;the best part of the entire film is definitely the famous Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend performance by Marilyn Monroe.
494;Her song and dance act is excellent, and definitely worth watching, if only as a video clip.
495;I enjoyed the movie, but I can check it off my watch list.
496;My daughter loves musicals and asked for this movie for Christmas.
497;The prices are excellent, they have everything you need and more, and you can shop from home!!
498;A true beauty and icon in every way.
499;both Monroe and Russell can sing well and the costumes are great.
500;Especially Russels sexy black one piece and Marilyn's purple evening gown.
501;Jane Russel's sarcasm really adds to it.
502;lots of cute guys in it.
503;marliyn is up front getting all the applause, but Russell is incredible!
504;a must have if youre a Monroe fan!
505;love the movie and it looks great too!
506;Highly recommended if you want to just sit and watch a lighthearted movie that shows the multiple talents of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe.
507;I bought it for the residents at the nursing home.
508;It's got all you could ask for in a movie: a star, good costumes, and musical numbers.
509;Wonderful movie brings back lots of memories of happy times.
510;Jane Russell is the true star of this film
511;The billing stated that she was The Star of the film, and the billing was correct.
512;Jane sparkles as the smart, witty best friend to Lorelei .
513;Jane's sparkling repartee as well as her performance capabilities (and my dad says her beauty) make her the most fun to watch.
514;She is what is known in theater circles as a triple threat
515;Oh, don't get me wrong
516;However, it is her performance of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend that is her dazzling moment, but Jane dazzles throughout the movie!
517;This one is a wonderful, rewatchable film, but I don't just watch it for the dubious pleasure of Marilyn in another typecast roll.
518;what a treat lies in store for you.
519;rated as a comic actor is wonderful.
520;Jane Russell steals the film in the final reel by spoofing Marilyn in an uproarious French courtroom scene
521;It has a obvious plot with fairly good acting and a couple of good songs.
522;hard Marilyn Monroe fan, I thought I'd give this musical a chance.
523;I was not expecting much, to be honest, but as it turned it, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) is undoubtedly one of the best musicals of its time and one of Monroe's best performances.
524;Marilyn shines as the blonde (of course) and Jane Russell also stars as her brassy brunette companion.
525;It follows a simple, but delightful plot: Lorelei Lee (Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Russell) are beautiful and immensely talented showgirls.
526;The end is a glittering wedding to tip off the perfect film.
527;produced, but it is one of the best musicals I have ever seen.
528;It has lavish production numbers, laughable dialogue, pretty clothes, two beautiful ladies at the head, bright Technicolor, the list goes on.
529;Most of the musicals recognized as classics are MGM's gems, and while these were great films in their own right, Fox had a succession of great musicals under its belt as well.
530;Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell turn out beautiful and long.
531;lasting performances in roles that seem tailor.
532;It is without a doubt one of the best films in my collection.
533;It is worthy of viewing multiple times over.
534;One of the things I love about this movie?
535;These 2 women are still considered to be beautiful and sexy, in spite of the fact that they were neither one, a size six!
536;A funny movie that has a happy ending, my favorite kind!
537;Her natural flair for comedy added with her sex appeal makes her a treasure.
538;Monroe herself has said that one must be smart to be able to play dumb.
539;I truly think she was vastly underrated as an actress.
540;Jane Russell(The brunette equivilant of sexiness) makes a perfect co. star for Marilyn.
541;Their onscreen chemistry makes them a fine pair to behold.
542;The film also has Marilyn in her classic Diamonds are a girls Best friend number which IMO is one of cinemas best.
543;He is a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe and was thrilled to receive it.
544;If you love Marilyn Monroe, you'll love this movie.
545;The iconic number Diamonds are a Girl's Best friend is, of course, a classic.
546;Jane Russell is fabulous, too.
547;She has some great lines .
548;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
549;The music is great .
550;I also happen to love musicals and this was an era of some great ones.
551;Monroe shines in the superbly photographed and choreographed production numbers, most notably Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
552;an unusually perfect marriage of star, scenario, dialogue, director, and music.
553;Jane Russell is the perfect compliment.
554;This is a movie for Monroe fans and for those unfamiliarwith what made her an icon.
555;the film adaptation of the broadway musical stars Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell as 2 entertainers on a cruise ship a wonderful comedy
556;With Howard Hawks' pacing, together with Jane Russell's performance, the support (often absent in a lot of Monroe's films) is present to create a movie that is genuinely funny and quickly moves.
557;The teaming of Monroe and Russell is great.
558;incredibly funny (i. e., the scenes with the small rich kid) and as everyone knows, she gives a dynamite performance on Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.
559;She and Russell are also great on the other numbers.
