1;A good dramatic movie with no shortage of excitement and interesting plot.
2;A good movie, a good story line, good acting.
3;Raging Bull is one of the most gripping, brutal, and magnetic films ever made.
4;This film, along with GoodFellas, represented Scorsese's apex.
5;For an extraordinary film, look no further.
6;Robert De Niro is SPECTACULAR in this amazing 80's classic about boxer Jake La Motta.
7;I really don't think I should discuss this film any further, all I can say is that if you haven't seen it yet, then you absolutely must see it now, and if you've seen it already, well, see it again and relish in the brilliance of the entire thing.
8;From the perfectly profane and in your face script to the excellent supporting performances from Cathy Moriarty and ESPECIALLY Joe Pesci, this film is a masterpiece of a character study.
9;the ending scenes are some of the best you will ever see, and Robert De Niro gives us all some of the truest,most wrenching, and unbelievably powerful acting.
10;This is a masterful drama that can be watched over and over again and still punch you in the gut.
11;and this is the film which solidifies(at least for me) that Bobby D here is one of the greatest actors of all time.
12;and one of my favorite films of all time.
13;Raging Bull directed by Martin Scorsese is probably his best film to date.
14;Filmed in gorgeous black and white, Raging Bull tells the story of true.
15;life boxer Jake La Motta played brilliantly by De Niro.
16;He gained a lot of weight for this role, he is truly unrecognizable towards the end of the film, but besides that his blistering performance earned him his second Oscar, his portrayal is both frightening and riveting.
17;This is one film every aspiring filmmaker should see, one of the essentials.
18;As an enormous fan of Scorsese's pre.2000 work, the catalogue of innovative, dark, gripping, and overall classic works that he did seem to be given the most praise, yet the least rewards.
19;Knowing that DeNiro won an Oscar for this film, knowing that Pesci was nominated (but lost) and knowing that Scorsese was also up for one of those prized trophies, yet lost .
20;Raging Bull is one of those near perfect films that was released in the 80s, yet still seems powerful and relevant today.
21;Perhaps it is the skill of Scorsese behind the camera to give us a non.
22;Perhaps it is the sharp editing that takes, what could have been your average sports movie, and transforms it into this pioneering black and white, quick cut by quick cut, journey into the darkness of man.
23;To begin, the casting of both DeNiro and Pesci was brilliant.
24;They brought to the screen a true presence of two brothers growing up in New York in the 40s, trying to cope with both fame and possible infidelity.
25;Their scenes are intense, yet delicate.
26;"to add to the amazing caliber of acting that Pesci and DeNiro commanded, ""Raging Bull"" demonstrated that Scorsese was a force to be reckoned with."
27;The acting is more than Oscar.
28;worthy, they define this film and the early 80s era.
29;My favorite scene was the shots of when La Motta was actually happy with his family .
30;Scorsese took an already iconic image and showed how his keen perception was able to make it better.
31;The characters were very interesting in the movie.
32;There is plenty of drama to keep one looking at the screen.
33;I am not into boxing but this movie really has a story that makes you look at the main character from one extreme end to another.
34;Martin Scorsese is the best director today and Robert De Niro gives the peformance of a lifetime.
35;Raging Bull is an instant classic.
36;Over time my enjoyment for a Scorsese film has waned.
37;Raging Bull, if anything, is worth that moment of tenderness between Robert de Niro and Cathy Moriarty, when Scorsese zooms in on the moments of touch and connection.
38;The great thing about this is,it combines two things I love:BOXING and MOVIES!
39;De Niro)top notch directing,and great camera work.
40;It was an interesting story about an interesting individual.
41;One of my favorite Robert DeNiro movies!
42;This was very well done by Scorsese, also Joe Pesci and Cathy M.
43;Considered by many to be the greatest film of the 80's, and ranking number four on AFI's top 100 greatest American films, `Raging Bull' has become a landmark in American cinema.
44;Martin Scorsese will always be remembered for this film, and rightfully so, for `Raging Bull' is not merely a sports film or merely just a drama but `Raging Bull' captures something rare, something monumental.
45;`Raging Bull' captures the essence of a man and the time in which he lived with such precise perfection that the audience is transported into this mans life, walking in his shoes and fighting his personal (as well as professional) battles.
46;there are many facets to this movie that help elevate it to `masterpiece' levels of brilliance.
47;First you have the flawless direction by Martin Scorsese.
48;In my humble opinion this is probably his finest moment behind the lens.
49;Scorsese is often praised for his `gangster' films, most notably `Good Fellas', but in my eyes it will always be his weightier work that shines the brightest.
50;Films like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull' are truly Scorsese's crowning achievements.
51;His decision to shoot the film in classic black and white film is another bonus to an already fantastic film.
52;It adds layers of honesty and humanity that are at times lost in the glitzy colors flooding the screen.
53;Scorsese is also responsible for capturing some of the greatest scenes of violence ever recorded on film.
54;The only other director I've seen able to capture this same intensity was Ron Howard in `Cinderella Man'.
55;Scorsese was also able to capture the feel and mood of the era in which `Raging Bull' takes place.
56;The way individuals interact with one another, the dialog and the emotional construction is a marvelous representation of the time period as well as the subject.
57;Couple this with Michael Chapman's glorious cinematography, rich and vibrant despite it's grit and lack of color, and you have a film that looks as brilliant as it plays out.
58;These are the moments that cement De Niro as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen.
59;de Niro has help in the form of Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci.
60;Pesci is flawless as Jake's devoted brother Joey.
61;Pesci is always on top of his game when playing the scheming and loud mouthed gangster (i. e. `Casino' and his Oscar winning performance in `Good Fellas') but here he is more subdued and subtle and I think this adds a layer of realism to his performance.
62;In my opinion, this may be his finest performance to date.
63;Cathy Moriarty is also stunning as Vickie, La Motta's second wife.
64;The blonde bombshell gives De Niro a run for his money and proves she is more than just a pretty face.
65;Her attachment to her character is obvious and certainly pays off in the end.
66;There is no flaw to be found here, for Scorsese crafts a marvelous portrait of a man destroyed by his own carnal weaknesses.
67;Regardless, there is no denying the fact that `Raging Bull' is a flawless film, a marvel, a spectacle and most definitely one of the greatest films ever made.
68;robert deniro is my number 2 favorite actor.
69;the great part of the movie was visually.
70;the fight scenes were great.
71;i honestly believed deniro was boxing for real.
72;"Voted best film of the 1980s', Martin Scorsese's 1980 boxing tour de force ""Raging Bull"" is indeed one of the best movies ever made."
73;Covering the life of famed boxer Jake La Motta (portrayed by Robert De Niro, whose physical transformation throughout the movie is as impressive as his performance, which is a contender for his best).
74;Spanning 25 years through Jake's life, we see his rise and fall well documented.
75;We see his struggle to keep his title, to stay fit, to maintain a solid family life as well as his relationship to his brother Joey (Joe Pesci).
76;This is what true filmmamking is all about.
77;It's a tragic story, but a good one.
78;It's a classic drama that will be enjoyed by men and women alike.
79;De Niro incredible in his Oscar winning performance.
80;Black and white cinematography captures the feel of the 1940's and 50's.
81;Raging Bull is a real american classic, and, that's as much from a cinematographic perspective as it is anything else.
82;I'm sure there are others who can expound much better on the film's amazing cultural impact as well as it's simple and driving facility with the narrative of Jake Lamotta but this transfer looks unbelievable and is well worth the upgrade.
83;Later on was named the best movie of the decade (80's), which I think is true.
84;The package is beautifully done (Yes!
85;scenes featurettes, a making of documentary, trailers, and some other very interesting stuff.
86;this movie is a masterpiece.
87;The acting is perfect, and I don't only mean De Niro, who got the Oscar for this role and is in my opinion one of the best actors ever, but Joe Pesci, who is as always sensational, and Cathy Moriarty in the role of Vickie.
88;The shooting in black and white is a very wise decision, the photography by Michael Chapman, the music (Cavalleria Rusticana fits perfectly), the editing that got an Oscar is also a great job well done, the story, the screenplay, and even the fight scenes are just absolutely amazing (and I just hate violence .)
89;i recommend this movie to absolutely everybody.
90;A film brimming with fire and passion.
91;THE quintessential Scorsese picture, his best film and surely the one he will be remembered by.
92;DeNiro gives one of the best performances in film history, the physical transformation is astonishing but the emotional rhythm of his performance is also admirable.
93;He captures the essence of LaMotta, a man who is insecure with himself and his sexuality and takes it off with his wife and with his opponents in the ring.
94;The boxing sequences are nothing short of brilliant and they're technical marvels as well.
95;DeNiro is probably the greatest actor of his generation and this is his best performance.
96;Joe Pesci is also great as LaMotta's brother, a flawless performance that could almost compare to DeNiro's.
97;Powerhouse direction by Scorsese and a gem of a script by Paul Schrader.
98;One of the best films of all time and without a doubt the best movie of the 1980's.
99;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
100;This film is so totally engaging it seems more real even than reality.
101;The performances are so vivid and intense you feel as if you are right in the room, the kitchen, the night.

I:8391;106;All of what these others say in praise is true.

I:8391;111;This is an incredible slice.
I:8391;112;Robert DeNiro plays LaMotta, and it's as riveting and brilliant as the young Brando was.
I:8391;113;The b&w photography is also superb.
I:8391;114;DeNiro won the Oscar for best actor"
115;I really want to give this 2 stars, but because the acting and cinematography is superb, I'm giving it 3.
116;It is as if the writers have completely dehumanized the cast of characters and are portraying them more as animals.
117;Man has feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, a conscience.
118;i just watched this movie and let me tell you, it is a genuine masterpiece.
119;in 100 yrs., people will look at our greatest forms of entertainment, and this will be recognized.
120;it will truly make you feel more like a human.
121;truly a work of greatness.
122;well, i thought i had 7 good favorite movies figured out, and this one comes along and beats out most of them.
123;For me, Raging Bull has to be the best movie of the past three decades.
124;The performances are brilliant, the camera.
125;work is magnificent and the script is amazing.
126;(He also deserved Oscars for Taxi Driver and Goodfellas).
127;What makes this movie great is the way that it portrays Lamotta.
128;He is a sinner, but yet he still has goodness in his heart.
129;This film is truly a masterpiece.
130;This is one of the best movies of all time.
131;Terrifically acted and directed, this is Scorsese and Deniro at the height of their powers.
132;And somehow I still liked Joe Pesci the best.
133;From the kitchen scene near the start till the end Raging Bull is emotional and believable.
134;This is a great movie, portraying boxer Jake LaMotta as a very unsympathetic character but largely as he really was.
135;He is subject to wild fits of jealousy over his wife, even when it involves organized crime figures.
136;the performances of all the major characters are outstanding, starting with DeNiro as LaMotta.
137;Cathy Moriarty as his wife and Joe Pesci as LaMotta's brother Joey both clearly deserved their Oscar nominations.
138;term effects on the two men that I viewed online interviews to see if they could still speak without slurring.
139;This is a great movie, a classic about a man that you dislike, yet do have a bit of sympathy for at the end.
140;Scorsese is Scorsese because of films like this.
141;the very fact that they can both make you love and feel for such an unappealing man as Lamotta is testiment to their brilliance.
142;this is a brilliant film with Deniro shining in the lead role.
143;Little Joe Pesci was also well cast.
144;Robert De Niro's Oscar performance as Jake LaMotta is still one of the best movies made.
145;Scorsese helped bring out a very human side of a temperamental boxer who can't keep it together.
146;Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also give wonderful talent to this story.
147;Greatest film about the boxing business.
148;deNiro is terrific as 'Jake LaMotta'.
149;gripping tale on his true life adventure of just waking up.
150;very insecure manic/depressive type [LaMotta] was portrayed masterfully by a fine actor, Robert DeNiro.
151;excellent supporting cast reinforces this movie of impact on a gruesome 'sport'.
152;Robert De Niro stars in this extremely compelling look at the 1940's greatest boxer, and middle weight champion Jake La Motta.
153;De Niro puts on an amazing performance, (not sparing the bad language, but it adds flavor)giving you an extremely effective look at life in the U. s in the Bronx during the 1940's and 50's.
154;All in all, an amazing film, that won two academy awards, see it.
155;If you are a fan of Joe Peshi you'll love this film.
156;Once again DeNiro's performance is outstanding as the prize.
157;Cinematography was also worthy of mention, captivating at times.
158;this movie was great plot wise, and scorsese did an excellent job of adapting the life of prizefighter jake la mata into a movie
159;My first inclination is to wax rhapsodic about the extra features, which you can see listed in the editorial reviews and which I spent most of my day off devouring.
160;So, in short: This is an incredible motion picture representing a high water mark for the director, the screenwriters, the cinematographer, the editor and the entire cast.
161;It's a beautiful, harrowing experience and if you haven't seen it, I can't encourage you strongly enough to fix that.
162;"the bottom line: ""Raging Bull,"" a great film and one of the best of the 80's and of the past half century, is ."
163;finally available in the format and presentation it deserves.
164;And that's an incredibly good thing.
165;This movie is truly a masterpiece.
166;why is it a masterpiece?
167;Simply put, Robert De Niro pulls off one of the most believable performances I've seen in any movie.
168;La Motta is not a likable character by any means, but the strength of the movie is that he is a believable character.
169;It's a fascinating story of how a person's life can spiral down into destruction, and Scorcese's no holds barred approach makes it all the more believable.
170;the film is very good, however, it became a cookie cutter for Joe Pesci roles.
171;This film is these two actors working together at their best, but Scorsese himself has beat these two into the ground.
172;Simply one of the films ever made.
173;Acting is at its top, so is the story and everything else in this masterpiece.
174;It's full of bonus features and has some actual footage.
175;Anyone who has ever lived in NY or NJ knows guys like this, but so what.
176;in the end its really just a brilliant portrayal of an angry lowlife.
177;life former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, a film that has features some memorable aspects to it.
178;perhaps most memorable is the physical transformation of lead actor Robert De Niro, who gained somewhere around 50 pounds to play LaMotta at the end of this film.
179;the story moves well with few, if any, lulls and each fight scene is fairly credible although a little too brief.
180;white photography also is excellent in here and makes me wish more modern.
181;usually the Hollywood actresses are a lot better looking than the real.
182;If you can stand that constant profane assault on your ears, it's still a very watchable movie.
183;I found this to be one of those films that kept getting better with multiple viewings.
184;It is filmed in black and white, and the visual style is solid.
185;in addition to covering LaMotta's career, the film follows his relationship with his brother, Joey, and his wife.
186;That's a good point, I must admit.
187;If you removed the f. words from the dialogue, you have a 20 minute movie, I told a few friends of mine.
188;In fact, the language tells you about how these characters think and feel.
189;And the movie really is a character.
190;driven film, so the plot is secondary.
191;i loved the opening of the film.
192;The music is just beautiful, and the slow motion dancing of a lone, robed and hooded boxer in the ring is an image that stays with you.
193;The black and white cinematography is glorious throughout this film.
194;The costumes, sets, and automobiles give the film a very authentic 1940's and '50's feel.
195;The boxing scenes are beautiful and brutal at the same time.
196;Technically, this film is a masterpiece.
197;the greatest thing about Raging Bull is the performance of Robert De Niro.
198;Much has been made about his weight gain during the course of this film (and it is amazing), but the intense anger, sadness, and loneliness of Jake La Motta comes through brilliantly due to De Niro's acting.
199;Just say its name and the film has a power and presence that few films have.
200;"Before I watched the film for the first time, I had alternately heard it described as ""the greatest film ever made with the most powerful performance of Robert Deniro's career"" and ""some boxing movie."""
201;While they are sometimes prone to falling by the wayside, both Joe Pesci's and Cathy Moriarti's performance deserves a close look.
202;Though Denero is amazing in this film, I couldnt help but fall in love with Joe peci's charecter.

I:8391;216;Raging Bull has been acclaimed one of the twenty greatest movies in history by most of the major critics' and directors' polls (Sight and Sound, etc.), and it's proven to have been deeply influential to future generations of moviemakers.
I:8391;217;It's these works, plus his masterful documentaries The Last Waltz, My Personal Journey Through American Movies, My Voyage To Italy and the recent No Direction Home: Bob Dylan, that stand as the very finest examples of Scorsese's most vital, creative, passionate and rewarding work in the movies.
I:8391;218;Raging Bull, released in 1980, is truly one of the greatest films released that year, receiving eight Oscar nominations and winning two (Best Actor and Best Editing).

I:8391;223;This unique film offers its hardhitting message through words, violence, blood, and graphic images.
I:8391;224;Scorsese's signature directing style explores the psychological themes deeply without distracting the elaborate setting.
I:8391;225;The overall result offers a deeper examination of LeMotta's life and turbulances.
I:8391;226;Scorsese used this similar style to give """"Taxi Driver"""" (1976) its unique genius result."""
227;"This style has since influenced upcoming film directors and their films, including ""Pi"" (1998), ""Requiem For a Dream"" (2000), and ""L. i. e."" (2001)."

233;Pesci also makes a strong debut as Joey, LaMotta's brother and manager.
234;His signature aggressive acting style offers the extended brutality of this film, yet keeping De Niro in the spotlight.
235;This unique film is sure to leave audiences speechless as it has since its theatrical release.
236;The question that begs to be asked is do the supplemental materials in this package add to the legend of this great film?
237;This edition ranks as one of the great packages of a classic film in a few years.
238;The documentaries that are included with the film take you from the genesis of this project to it's aftermath compelling us to consider this film's legendary status.
239;It's also interesting that Scorsese doubted his fitfulness for what turned out to be the crowning achievement of his illustrious career.
240;I chose the joint one by Scorsese and Schoonmaker.
241;Not only is this track informative but Schoonmaker returns the complement to Scorsese, attributing her Oscar win to his vision.

282;"that's what makes ""Raging Bull"" so intriguing because for the most part, people never sympathize with a brutal man, an abusive man but through ""Raging Bull"", it's like watching an intriguing trainwreck of how Jake LaMotta lived his life and how this man had everything from a wonderful boxing career, made great money, had a beautiful wife but it was never enough for him."
283;and to accurately show this man's life, it was going to take remarkable dedication.
284;That's amazing dedication but for Scorsese, this was a man who was going through personal challenges.
285;"with ""Raging Bull"", this is a film that features wonderful filmmaking, top notch screenplay and magnificent acting that everything comes together perfectly."
286;For me, if you are a filmmaker who loves Scorsese's work or a cinema fan that admires his oeuvre, these four additional special features show us Scorsese, the filmmaker and Scorsese and De Niro, their awesome collaboration.
287;"It also is nice to see filmmakers come together and show their appreciation and explaining why ""Raging Bull"" was a masterpiece for them and then also hearing from past boxers who have worked or were good friends with Jake LaMotta chiming in."
288;Are special features meaningful for you?
289;Otherwise, if you really love this film and love Scorsese's work and De Niro's work, then yeah.
290;Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition is worth it!
291;"wonderful PQ, AQ plust three wonderful audio commentaries, a wonderful making of 1.5 hour long featurette and plenty of special features, if you truly enjoy this Scorsese masterpiece, ""Raging Bull: 30th Anniversary Edition"" is a must."
292;It deals with the aftermath of glory, the days after the lights, women, and success are all over.
293;The latter section is not the most exciting part, but it is the most meaningful.
294;What is important is survival.
295;Surviving and then moving on.
296;marty's doing his directing thing in the best way, they have the perfect girl for the job, Cathy Moriarty!!
297;And Joe Pesci of course in that fabulous role.
298;This small cast works together perfectly.
299;This is a fabulous film, and also a classic in American filmmaking.
300;And this movie, Raging Bull, is one of the reasons why.
301;Disc 1 gives you the movie with 3 outstanding commentary tracks.
302;Scorsese is always engrossing and entertaining with his remarks, and he always seems like just a big movie fan instead of an ego.
303;Because Scorsese is, above all, a collaborator and not a dominator.
304;He gives those who help him realize the vision plenty of credit.
305;And that includes DeNiro and Pesci, in some of the most convincing and breathtaking acting you'll ever witness.
306;One of the bravest performances committed to film, up there with Brando in Last Tango in Paris.
307;One interesting thing I learned in the commentaries and documentaries was that except for DeNiro, most of the actors in the movie were newcomers or relative unknowns.
308;As an ensemble, they are brilliant, another example of Scorsese's directing brilliance.
309;special Features: For me, the commentary tracks are the best extras because they allow you to see the film from multiple perspectives.
310;For instance, the checkered pattern in Pesci's suit when he's talking to DeNiro by the swimming pool in the rain is sharp and vivid.
311;That's just one small but significant example of how strong this new version is, aesthetically.
312;I've always been, well, knocked out by the use of sound in this movie, and not only can you hear the effects better than ever, the documentaries and commentary explain how the effects were put together.
313;Also, when you're not watching the movie, the packaging is beautiful.
314;It's like having a new edition of a classic book with first rate binding and printing on your shelf.
315;Sorry to gush, but this is almost a holy relic, something that fits with Scorsese's abiding theme of anguish and redemption through violence and blood.
316;"favorite scenes: the second Robinson fight
I:8391;317;The unique touches like that are what set Scorsese/DeNiro apart and take this film into the atmosphere of the sublime.
I:8391;318;His scene with Pesci in the """"Debonair Social Club"""" is brilliant, with Colasanto conveying barely restrained anger and frustration."""
319;Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL, considered by many the best film of its decade, was released in 1980 to mixed critical response and middling box office.
320;"On the long ""Oscar Gets It Wrong"" list, you'll find RAGING BULL's Best Picture and Best Director loss to Robert Redford's ORDINARY PEOPLE near the top."
321;Looking at RAGING BULL again with 30 years of perspective, my best guess is it comes down to the story the picture tells.
322;a hallmark of commercial filmmaking .
323;ring victories are more an expression of the triumph of brute force .
324;doling it out and taking it .
325;He realizes he's completely screwed up his life.
326;With Michael Chapman's stunning cinematography, Schoonmaker's explosive editing, and the rich performances of his cast, Scorsese fashioned a ravishing, monochromatic treatise on violence in the national character of post.
327;His startlingly innovative direction of the boxing sequences gave each match its own, unique stylistic jolt, while staying true to the events of the real.
328;But it's a performance that is powerful throughout.
329;One of De Niro's greatest roles.
330;The cinematography is excellent as well as Joe Pechi ofcourse.
331;But the real stars i woudl say are De Niro and Scorsese.
332;Thanks for everyone who worked in this excellent movie, adn thank you De NIro.
333;Good story line about the fighter.
334;This is crisp, sharp and De Niro is as good as it gets.
335;Scorsese has probably created the greatest motion picture of the last thirty years in Raging Bull.
336;based on LaMotta's biography ( a fantastic book), Raging Bull is as real and authentic as a film can possibly get.
337;The finest scenes are not necessarily the fight sequences, but rather the script and dialogue between the brothers (Jake's brother is played by Joe Pesci in a first rate performance) are as realistic as I've yet to come across.
338;Moreover the scenes of the classy old New York City nightclub world are simply astounding.
339;They'll make you long for an era that has since passed into history along with the catchy Big Band music that went along with it.
340;speaking of past glory days, the world of professional boxing is portrayed in Raging Bull when it enjoyed its highest popularity.
341;Scorsese uses a color sequence only a few times when reflecting on LaMotta family videos, otherwise the bulk of the picture is shot in a beautiful and nostalgic black and white, which makes it hard to believe it was produced in the late 1970s.
342;the film is a classic.
343;De Niro's in it with Joe Pesci, Scorsese directed, enough said.
344;scorsese commentary (which is always great to listen to) with editor Thelma Schoonmaker.
345;"additional cast and crew and ""Storytellers"" commentary (participants TBA)."
346;Even though it's one the best films ever made, fans would still like to see it on it's true widescreen format.
347;I've been hearing that good movies such as American Pie and The Good, Bad, and Ugly are also widescreen phonies.
348;The acting and cinematography was excellent, Martin is a genius.
349;If you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it.
350;Still it is a good movie in black and white, probably deserving of the awards it got.
351;Video and Audio lacking a little bit, but overall a good film.
352;In 'Raging Bull' Scorcese does with ease what most film.
353;De Niro's method acting reaches it's pinnacle here in a role that he absolutely lived and breathed for over a year.
354;His dedication to the part, coupled to the fact that it was he who brought the story to Scorcese's attention, makes this fine cinematic achievement as much his as it is Scorcese's.
355;the award winning editing links this film together beautifully, nowhere is this more evident than in the fight scenes.
356;Engaging right from the start.
357;The grittiness of the boxing world in the 40's just jumps off the screen!
358;I saw it when it came out, and again a few days ago.
359;The brilliance of director Martin Scorcese, the gorgeous b/w cinematography by Michael Chapman, and the exacting art direction, set decoration, and costumes are the best reasons to sit through this portrayal of a violent man.
360;Great movie in perfect, used condition.
361;Robert de Niro is an excellent actor.
362;This movie is highly recommended for boxing fans.
363;Yet another exampled of a 'great' movie that is highly overrated.
364;the movie is well recorded, but that is it.
365;if you know why this is a 'great' movie, please email me and let me know.
366;white film, an underdog in its day and a classic today, makes a rousing comeback in this double.
367;extras dig deep into Scorsese's methods and motivations, drawing heavily on the observations of Thelma Schoonmaker, his longtime editor who won an Oscar for the film.
368;a short but telling extra shows how carefully Scorsese and De Niro followed the script from La Motta's real fights.
369;"minute ""Shot for Shot"" intercuts footage from the actual and movie fights, the drama heightened by Frank Warner's jungle."
370;The frenetic trailer kicks ass.
371;Despite a difficult marriage, Jake's brother and manager introduces him to the young and beautiful Vickie.
372;He continues to fight and in 1947 he is married once again.
373;His days are spent entertaining in nightclubs as a washed up boxer.
374;I enjoyed the reference to On the Waterfront at the end and despite the coarse language, the film had good characters, cinematography, and directing.
375;Shot in stark black and white to re create the in your face tabloid look of the 40's and 50's, Scorcese, with a tour de force De Niro performance made a film which, like its protagonist, is both repellant and fascinating.
376;the supporting performances are magnificent: Joe Pesci's Joey is one of the great supporting performances of ANY decade.
377;cathy Moriarty as Vicki is sensational.
378;her Bronx nasal twang always seems at odds with her stark blonde beauty.
379;the truth is a lot of talented poeple made a fantastic film about a guy whose one attribute in life was that he could take a beating.
380;the black and white transfer is crisp and clear, but there are NO special features to speak of.
381;De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that.
382;This film has been named as the best American film of the 80's and looking back I think it just pippedBlade Runner (The Director's Cut)for me although truth be told I enjoyed watching the latter a lot more and still do.
383;Scorcese does a brilliant job directing here but it is really the excellent acting of the brilliant De Niro and the excellent Pesci that makes this film.
384;This film is not easy to watch but truly great films seldom are as they challenge you to address issues outside your comfort zone and generate emotions of every kind .
385;i wanted to see this movie for a long time because Robert DeNiro is a favorite actor.
386;The cast came across as real people, albeit not the kind of people I'd like to be with.
387;I think that's an offshoot of good directing and good acting.
388;Was it well acted and directed?
389;Now, did you like the movie and want to watch it again a second time?
390;Yes, this is the best movie of the 1980's.
391;Yes, DeNiro gives one of the finest performances ever, by anyone.
392;It really is that good.
393;Everything about it is amazing.
394;What Bobbie de Niro offers in this movie is something more than simple acting.
395;and when you watch him playing La Motta you can understand why!
396;Very probably the man knew that this would prove to be one of the best movies of the last twenty years and undoubtfully one of de Niro's strongest performances : nothing short of Brando's one in In the Waterfront .
397;I found it really touching!
398;This was a man who had to fight against himself more than against his opponents, a restless heart, a macho, prisoner of his catholic upbringing and his bad temper, but deep down inside a very good hearted man.
399;everything is quite perfect in this masterpiece!
400;And it would have been well deserved!
401;This is the best performance by and actor and director working together on a powerful film.
402;Martin Scorsese's 'Raging Bull' is his finest movie to date, a bleak look at 1940s middleweight boxer Jake La Motta.
403;Seen by Scorsese as his final film, the New York director crafted a brilliant, mesmerising movie that captivates and shocks with its brutallity.
404;life, and other scenes are moulded perfectly for the film.
405;The script is dedicated to La Motta's struggles, in and out of the ring .
406;he gets scared, so he beats his wife, he's worried, so he hits his brother .
407;'Raging Bull' was made at a very personal time for Scorsese, and this is reflected much in the film .
408;La Motta is charged with emotion, yet the scene is cut away with almost a harshness to life after the event.
409;martin Scorsese, I feel, is one of the greatest .
410;He has created some of the great movies, but certainly not Hollywood movies.
411;'Taxi Driver', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'The Last Temptation of Christ' .
412;all brilliant in their own right, but 'Raging Bull' is his masterpiece.
413;The acting throughout is flawless .
414;Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty giving great performances as La Motta's punch.
415;an artistic, stylish piece of filmmaking.
416;Deniro is the greatest actor ever.
417;He and Pesci are made to co. star with each other.
418;Robert deniro is just a born acter , if u ask me he litterlly gets into his rolls.
419;I loved it and I'm not even into boxing.
420;As detailed as Martin Scorsese's films were, this is an oversight.
421;Maltese Falcon ), all the men wore those cool hats.
422;Nothing exciting about this boxer's story.
423;I merely saw this movie for Robert DeNiro's performance, and Martin Scorsese's film making reputation.
424;Yeah, still Scorsese's best, though Goodfellas gives it a run for its money.
425;this movie lives and breathes.
426;It's a long movie because Scorsese has to take his (real.
427;For a little while there, some great directors made some great black and white movies.
428;This film is of course regarded extremely well but I think some aspects of it are not very good.
429;de Niro's performance is great as always when he plays a tough Italian New Yorker.
430;i'll just get this out of the way right now: Raging Bull is the best boxing movie ever.
431;The direction is suberb, as they put amazing detail into the fights.
432;The only adds to the gritty feeling, and makes you feel like you're really watching an old boxing match.
433;The cinematography and editing are top.
434;but the thing that really shines in Raging Bull is the acting, especially De Niro, in what could quite possibly be the best performance of his career.
435;The scene at the end with La Motta in jail is one of the best acted scenes in movie history.
436;It's so simple, yet the raw emotion and regret from Jake makes it so incredibly powerful.
437;Showing extreme dedication to his work, De Niro actually gained 60 lbs.
438;There's just not enough good things I could say about De Niro here.
439;The best actor ever, in his prime, and giving one of his best performances ever.
440;Pesci is his usual brilliant self here, and Frank Vincent is quite good as well.
441;raging Bull was voted as the best movie of the 80's for a reason.
442;forward, this is brilliant filmmaking at it's best.
443;1) The first movie is a sports movie with great photography.
444;See LaMotta lust after a beautiful woman, see him win the girl, see his temper ruin the relationship, see Deniro go psychotic and start beating up women.
445;"Unsatisfying as a whole
I:8391;446;Have always wanted to watch this movie and it definitely didn't let me down.
I:8391;447;star cast and a lot of fun to watch.
I:8391;448;If it's on your list, watch asap, especially if it's free with your prime subscription.
I:8391;449;Raging Bull is an amazing movie, it is one of the best movies I have seen.
I:8391;450;The performance Robert DeNiro gives in this film is also one of the best I have seen.
I:8391;451;Watching this movie again reminds you just how incredible an actor Robert DeNiro is and he actually gained weight for this role of """"Jake La Motta""""."""
452;deNiro is so believable in this role you forget that it is DeNiro.
453;Robert DeNiro is at his best in this story of Jake LaMotta.
454;I watched the fights with my dad when I was very young, so it was very interesting to see what the man was really like.
455;This was a good movie, I love any movie that Robert Denoir and Joe Pesci play in.
456;Psychotic, wife beating, overeating, paranoid freak.
457;Robert De Niro gives a career defining performance as the legendary Jake LaMotta.
458;Black and white photography, as well as the engaging score add to the lore of this film.
459;De Niro and Pesci are terrific together!
460;Perfect film to be in black and white!
461;de niro does good job but its an old movie made the old way.
462;kinda boring but worth watch.
463;He was a jerk and should move into obscurity.
464;One of the best Robert Deniro and boxing movies I've ever seen.
465;Joe Pesci also proves to be an excellent supporting actor.
466;"Raging Bull"" has been called the greatest film of the 80s."
467;After seeing this film last night I would say it is one of the most powerful films of all time.
468;Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19.
469;"As much as I absolutely adore ""Rocky,"" ""Raging Bull"" is a deeper, more realistic film."
470;"But whereas ""Raging Bull"" is raw, ""Rocky"" is inspiring."
471;one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing .
472;They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so. called connection.
473;this is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career.
474;"Along with ""Taxi Driver,"" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come."
475;The bonus disc is so great and well worth the money alone!
476;Almost better than the film.
477;If you loved the Rocky movies or if you loved the mob films like The Godfather or Goodfella's, This is the best of both worlds for you!!
478;Boxing and the mob back in the day WERE hand in hand.
479;This real life story shows that.
480;"Even the best films of the 2000's can't compete with ""Raging Bull""."
481;This is a classic masterpiece that completely avoids the sugarcoated melodrama of today's movies .
482;Raging Bull shows the power of carefully crafted filmmaking.
483;Scorsese's film is a rare example of what a true visionary can achieve .
484;and it should serve as the cinematic inspiration of all aspiring filmmakers.
485;"Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is the riveting, sad, hilarious and devastating tale of one of boxing's best middleweight fighters, ""Giacobbe"" Jake LaMotta."
486;this movie, while it deals better perhaps than any other regarding the actual brutality of boxing, transcends the genre of the sweet science.
487;Every scene in this movie has a multitude of meanings that only reveals itself upon repeated viewings and every shot is a still, a la Robert Bresson (Diary of a Country Priest (The Criterion Collection).
488;Scorsese's ability to tell such a multifaceted tale about such a limited, brutal man is revelatory of his talent.
489;Domestic abuser, control freak, paranoid nut, animal, superb boxer and occasional wise man.
490;The black and white choice of footage is perfect, and Scorsese takes us back to NYC in the 40's and 50's.
491;His wife, the beautiful Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) is someone he loves and covets so much that he HAS to control her.
492;"The same thing with his brother (the hilarious and demented ""hit me in the face"" scene and his ass thrashing of Joey for no reason are the results of his near emotional retardation."
493;He wants to walk it alone because he believes this is what a man does.
494;vikki represents, to LaMotta, purity and innocence.
495;He is unworthy of them all and there is a ruse somewhere.
496;"Though his determination to tell Robinson that he ""never got him down"" is intended to be a sign of male bravado, one can also read it as an admission of personal defeat."
497;The scene in which he is thrown into a cell for unwittingly introducing a 14 year old girl to men in his bar is absolutely essential to his character.
498;For me, this andTaxi Driverare Scorsese's best films.
499;Absolutely recommended for anyone who loves great cinema, and especially if you love boxing.
500;I don't want to say is Scorsese best film, but it is one of my favorite movies.
501;Da Niro and Pesci performances are above awesome.
502;Raging Bull is undoubtedly one of the great boxing movies, others include Champion, Somebody Up There Likes Me and The Harder They Fall but my favourite is still Body And Soul with the great John Garfield.
503;His brother (Pesci)manages him, and hangs out with local mobsters.
504;La Motta's boxing career grows, as does his love life with his girlfriend.
505;He wins match after match, until the only person that will fight him is Sugar Ray.
506;At this point, everything is perfect.
507;He is now married to Moriarty, and he and his brother are getting rich.
508;Moriarty makes an incredible debut, loving De Niro, in his best role.
509;Pesci almost steals the spotlight, and Frank Vincent turns in a great performance as always.
510;Great acting, great characters, and a great story on a troubled man.
511;I will watch it again with great pleasure.
512;Deniro is awesome as usual.
513;time classic, easily director Martin Scorsese's greatest work.
514;LaMotta's personal demons are exorcised in gritty black.
515;the performances in this film are so relaxed, the viewer sometimes feels as if he/she is watching a documentary, a black.
516;Frequent improvisation on the part of the actors also contributes to a sense of captured reality.
517;robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the iconic LaMotta.
518;His performance earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.
519;"As the ""Bronx bull"", DeNiro is tough and passionate."
520;The viewer is drawn to care about this character primarily because of the strong personal connection formed as a result of the realistic, and totally original Scorsese exhibition.
521;The Mascagni score is passionate and this music provides a steady comfort throughout the peaks of Jake's life, creating an emotional and bittersweet counter.
522;joe Pesci's portrayal of Jake's brother Joey is also memorable.
523;"Joey's own bursts of anger echo those of his brother and Pesci's brilliant performance is a preview of his character Tommy in Scorsese's ""Goodfellas""."
524;cathy Moriarty also shines as Jake's girlfriend (and later wife), Vickie.
525;Scenes between Moriarty and DeNiro reveal genuine, and crucial chemistry between the two.
526;"above all, ""Raging Bull"" is a biopic brought to life by Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker."
527;Alongside film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's cuts are imaginative and clever, action in the ring is captured up close and personal and shots are beautifully interchanged to create the right mood for each sequence.
528;As mentioned before, the theme music for this picture is the Intermezzo by Mascagni, a gorgeous Italian piece which accents the bittersweet nostalgia of Jake's career and personal peaks, as well as underlining the sadness of his low points.
529;Raging Bull continues to endure as a classic film as well as a milestone in movie.
530;This picture is all heart.
531;winning performance as La Motta is one of the greatest achievements in acting history: De Niro invests every raw emotion into his character, revealing La Motta to be as a self.
532;"besides De Niro, the other performances in ""Raging Bull"" are absolutely superlative including Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife Vicki and Joe Pesci as Jake's manager brother Joe."
533;"One of the most memorable scenes in ""Raging Bull"" is not the brutal boxing scenes but set in a living room where Jake suspiciously believes that Joe is having an affair with his wife Vicki."
534;, it is the way De Niro shows the inner twisting logic of his jealousy that speaks volumes.
535;besides the magnificent acting, the movie represents a cinematic peak for Scorsese and his crew.
536;Thelma Schoonmaker's editing and Michael Champman's cinematography are absolutely outstanding, particularly in the fights between Sugar Ray Robinson and La Motta where they make those scenes look savage and poetic through slow motion, off.
537;kilter camera angles and rapid edits.
538;Raging Bull was voted by several critics as the best movie of the 1980s.
539;Raging Bull is an encompassing masterpiece that does not date but grows through the passage of time.
540;"GoodFellas, ""Casino"" and ""The Departed"" are outstanding movies but for my money, no one involved in this great movie (not even Scorsese) has done better work since."
541;"This movie is more than a classic
I:8391;542;it really gives you a feel what life in the Bronx in the 1940's was like.
I:8391;543;de Niro is an amazing actor and transforms himself into Jake LaMotta!
I:8391;544;joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are fantastic co. stars in this film too.
I:8391;545;I love the factthat the film is in , yet Scorsese uses a beautiful touch in the film by showing""""home movies"""" of both Jake and Joey's wedding scenes in color, yet makes the filmlook """"1940's"""" by using scratches and such during the home clips."""
546;De Niro is onethe the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen, and this is his finest hour.
547;Also notable in the film is Joe Pesci's performance as the embattled boxer's brother.
548;A stirring, gripping tale of a fighter's tumultuous life and times in and out of the ring.
549;Robert De Niro gives an astounding performance as Jake Lamotta, the rampaging wild man who storms his way to the title and over damn near anything and everyone else.
550;Deniro won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actor for this one, and is hailed by fans and critics alike as his finest performance ever.
551;scorcese of course derves special mention as Director.
552;truly one of the greatest movies of all time, it will stay with you long after youve watched it.
553;I love De Niro movies typically.
554;every movie my son and I watch, we rate them after as a family thing, if you will, from 1 to 10.
555;Raging Bull is a powerful, provocative, realistic work of art, a character study about an emotionally.
556;brainer the following year when DeNiro took home the coveted Oscar for best actor.
557;Two other notable actors deserve mention here for their fine performances as well .
558;This collaboration once again produced an intense, gritty, often times seedy portrait of a lost, lonely, paranoid anti.
559;Martin Scorcese did a terrific job of directing The Raging Bull starring tremendous super.
560;star Robert De Niro as prizefighter Jake La Motta.
561;La Motta to Sugar Ray Robinson, this was a constant theme throughout the entire movie in my opinion.
562;This movie also has young Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriaty playing fine roles.
563;This is by far one of the best movies ever made.
564;The Black and white with the color home video was a fantastic touch.
565;I also love the constant theme music played throughout the movie.
566;The best of Scorcese's films.
567;Emotionally honest and stylistically brilliant.
568;This actor is at his very best, before the mannerisms took over, producing parodies of himself in his later career
569;No plot worthy of your time.
570;As for my father and I, it's a Two Thumbs Down kind of movie.
571;Based on LaMotta's memoirs and filmed in gorgeous black.
572;"Oscar winner De Niro, who famously packed on 50 pounds to do the ""fat"" scenes, is riveting as the brutish Jake, whose primary talent lies in the amount of punishment he can take in the ring."
573;are bravura pieces of filmmaking.
574;Raging Bull may be hard for some viewers to sit through, but Scorsese ultimately leads his protagonist, and us, to a state of grace.
575;Amazing job by DeNiro and cast, the action was unbelievable and the story was captivating.
576;A great movie and one that I would suggest sports enthusiast consider a must see.
577;This is one of the greatest movies ever.
578;It has what may be De Niro's best performance ever (it is hard to decide between this and Taxi Driver).
579;It also has superb directing, cinematography, and dialogue.
580;In fact, when it isn't a fight scene, this movie is all about great dialogue and interaction between the characters.
581;Joe Pesci is great as De Niro's brother, and Cathy Moriarty is great as his wife.
582;It's interesting to see Scorsese and DeNiro interact in the the first featurette but the rest is just a rehash of stuff found elswhere in the previous extras.
583;Raging Bull is one of the best films of all time not because of its boxing scenes but because of the humanity that is presented.
584;Sexuality is a key note of this movie because at all times, it is Jake's driving force in life.
585;I prefer to believe the latter.
586;An outstanding movie from a gifted director.
587;Scorsese continues to amaze me.
588;I recommend purchasing the Martin Scorsese Box Set from MGM, which includes this along with other Scorsese classics.
589;It is THE best sports movie, bar.
590;It also has to be one of the best movies ever made.
591;what makes this movie special is that all of the elements fit together snuggly and make a wonderful masterpiece.
592;First of all, De Niro's performance has got to be one of the greatest ever.
593;anymore, but it works and it makes the performance as great as it can be.
594;the other elements of the film are top notch.
595;did a superb and memorable job, which highly supplemented De Niro's performance.
596;perfect, expecially during those multiple.
597;What I admire most about this film is the choice of black and white cinematography.
598;I know it sounds like a turn off for some, but it really puts you into the 40's and 50's period, and the cinematography looks incredible.
599;Even the score was memorable.
600;Scorsese certainly has a knack of enhancing extraordinary scenes with extraordinary music .
601;all the other elements are excellent.
602;this is a must see film!
603;a classic performance from Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.
604;A mood masterpiece from director Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is the authority on boxing films as well as cinematic biographies.
605;arresting theme of Rise and Fall.
606;Moving at a steady and always involving beat, La Motta is shown taking more beatings, winning more titles and self.
607;As through a looking glass, there is always a feeling of not knowing what this fighting man will do next.
608;And in the great tradition of Scorsese's Italian American fables, this film forges a somber and exciting attitude all the way through.
609;Always worried that his wife is cheating on him, and thinking that his counterparts are working against him, Jake La Motta ventures beyond the point of no return.
610;Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese have undoubtedly constructed a picture of stark reality and emotional fire.
611;With its black and white colour as well as its unmistakably subdued tone, Raging Bull delivers great performances not only from De Niro, but from Joe Pesci as Joe La Motta (Jakes' brother) and Cathy Moriarty (Vikki La Motta).
612;Great movie, Very Violent, well not very.
613;robert De Niro Is a genius,Joe Pesci is great,Black and white adds to the overall effect of a such movie.
614;Raging Bull is a must to see for any De Niro Fan.
615;It is as raw as you can get.
616;It's because of this that it took me so long to see it in the first place.
617;"In one pivotal scene, when Vickie mentions that a boxer Jake is about to fight is cute, he beats the boy to a pulp causing a man to lean over to his friend in the audience and say ""he ain't pretty no more."""
618;Anyone who says DeNiro's performance is incredible is understating it massively.
619;This film displays the best performance I've ever seen by DeNiro and, easily, one of the best performances ever.
620;"Martin Scorsese is a magnificent director who has a long filmography filled with masterpieces, but I wouldn't be stretching the truth by suggesting that ""Raging Bull"" may very well be his best film."
621;It's no wonder The American Film Institute ranks it as the 24th best film of all time and the reason it is still talked about today.
622;"It seems that even though ""Ordinary People"" beat it out for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, I'm almost positive that years from now ""Raging Bull"" will most be remembered."
623;It's a masterpiece of cinema and truly deserves to be called one of the one hundred best films of all time.
624;Great, and first of a long reign of Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro.
625;True story, very impactful, and empathetic young Robert Deniro
626;This film is absolutely fantastic.
627;DeNiro and Pesci are great and Scorcese succeeds in everything he attempts to do.
628;It is one of the greatest character studies of all time.
629;but that is all it is, a phenomenal character study.
630;It may have a few more flaws and may have not been as obviously brilliantly directed and executed all around, but it deals with greater concepts and ideas of war and the people involved.
631;This ofcourse brings me back to my original point that a character study of one figure, no matter how brilliant, has definate limitations on its level of greatness in film over all.
632;This is my favorite movie of all time and I don't think anyone could disagree that Robert De Niro gave an astouding performance.
633;The boxing scenes are one of a kind and the story of Jake La Motta is highly compelling or disgusting, however you look at it.
634;One part of the movie that made it work so well that's not often mentioned is Paul Schrader's outstanding screenplay which helped to launch the trend towards gritty realism in Hollywood, along with Scorcese's other films, Mean Streets and Taxi Driver.
635;this movie has great acting and tells a wrenching story of one of the great boxers.
636;robert de niro is superb.
637;the musical backgroud is beautiful too.
638;De Niro and Pesci, great actors and certainly at their best.
639;But it's an incredible classic.
640;When you view Raging Bull in TRUE WIDESCREEN you see Scorsese's cameo in the final shot of the film when DeNiro performs his monologue in front of the mirror.
641;the True widescreen version of Raging Bull shows director Martin Scorsese.
642;Memorize the top, bottom, left and right of the screen.
643;It's my favorite movie of all time, the title character is played by my favorite actor of all time, and the director is my favorite director of all time.
644;:)What a way to start out the 80s!
645;then Marty comes back with a tour de force film that examines the trials and tribulations of an ordinary man's soul.
646;robert De Niro, in his second Oscar.
647;winning performance, portrays 1940s Bronx boxer, Jake La Motta.
648;What's so interesing about this movie, as well as practically ALL of Scorsese's cinematic gems, is that here you have an ordinary man trying to live an ordinary life by his own standards but can't because the local hoods have other plans for him.
649;At heart, La Motta is a closet romantic.
650;old Vickie the first time he sees her and she becomes his trophy and ideal.
651;It's amazing to watch scenes with Moriarty and De Niro.
652;it's also absolutely mesmerizing to watch De Niro transform in front of the cameras.
653;He goes from a promising boxer to a burnt.
654;He still holds the world record for the most weight an actor has put on in preparation for a role.
655;De Niro, you're the best there is and the best there ever will be!Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci give flawless perfomances.
656;They deservably won best supporting actor/actress nods for this film.
657;:))The cinematography and editing is top.
658;dearest Marty, you're a master!
659;In my book, that best director Oscar should've gone to you years ago!
660;Good movie but De Niro is always a treat.
661;This movie is an all time classic and De Niro is at his best!!
662;This movie shows the lifestyle of Jake Lamotta and the warrior he was in the boxing ring!
663;Lamotta was a true tough guy in the ring that beat Sugar Ray Robinson as some say is the greatest ever!
664;After i viewed this movie, i sat still for about 30 minutes recalling the utter masterpiece that i had just witnessed.
665;I have NEVER in my life seen acting like what was in this fine movie.
666;This movie is intense, hard to watch, painful, very graphic, very obscene(especially in lunguage), very surreal, and very violent.
667;It has the most violent and gory boxing scenes ever captured in cinema, and is absolutely stunning for a boxing movie.
668;acclaimed 1980 film RAGING BULL, and while I recognize what is good about it.
669;the performances, the sharply realistic style, and some of the hard.
670;Scorsese's equally acclaimed TAXI DRIVER was a much more compelling film dealing with perhaps even more sordid subject matter.
671;dimensional human being to us.
672;Once again, I am struck by Scorsese's realistic style: some of its scenes.
673;(I found the style a revelation the first time I saw MEAN STREETS.)
674;The boxing scenes (which are actually few for a boxing movie) were justly acclaimed for Scorsese's stylish direction and Thelma Schoonmaker's innovative editing (she won an Oscar for her editing of the film), and they still pack a punch today, so to speak.
675;And Scorsese gets good performances from his cast, particularly with Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother and Moriarty as the abused Vickie.
676;well, yeah, he won an Oscar for his performance here, and he is never unconvincing in his role (esp.
677;during his character's later years, because De Niro himself really did gain all that weight for the part).
678;Perhaps in that respect he was aiming to transform La Motta into something universal.
679;"It is certainly not an awful film, since it has its isolated compelling scenes and good performances
I:8391;680;I watched the movie the other day for the first time since I saw it on opening day in New York, with Jake La Motta in the audience in the front row.
I:8391;681;The area in which the boxing ring is located is full of cigarette smoke, as occasional flashes of cameras try to capture the moment before a fight.
I:8391;682;After the recital by Jake in 1964, the film turns into one monumental flashback beginning in 1941, which is unlocked by a powerful hook into Jake's face.
I:8391;683;This punch into Jake's face has a symbolic value as to how he sees the world.
I:8391;684;Hubris comes to mind when one thinks of Jake's persona, a man with exaggerated pride and confidence.
I:8391;685;in the world of boxing testosterone flood every aspect of life, as hurting someone is what brings home the bread.
I:8391;686;Everything surrounds this attitude in boxing, and Jake is the best there is at hurting others.
I:8391;687;De Niro does a magnificent job in being perceived as a male chauvinistic pig in his role as Jake when he uses his wife as a verbal punching bag.
I:8391;688;During the time when Jake sees Vickie he continues to box and dream for a title match.
I:8391;689;The moments between fights, including the wedding, are depicted through the only color scenes in the film, seemingly shot by a personal camera without sound, but symbolically it offers some of the happiest moments in Jake's life.
I:8391;690;This moment turns the whole film in a new direction, as Jake's inability to understand women is magnified.
I:8391;691;This brings back the notion of the soothing music in the opening of the film.
I:8391;692;Nonetheless, Jake learns his lesson, but at a very high price.
I:8391;693;As the film comes full circle, the audience is brought back to New York in 1964.
I:8391;694;This is the second time the audience gets to see the whole poster, which will provide some insight to what Jake La Motta gained throughout the film.
I:8391;695;martin Scorsese directs a powerful film that deals with wisdom, identity, and love through boxing.
I:8391;696;De Niro's performance was brilliant and well worth the Oscar it won, as he must have gained a tremendous amount of weight during time it took to make the film.
I:8391;697;The cinematography is excellent by Michael Chapman, as it helps highlight the emotional moments and the brutal fight scenes.
I:8391;698;When all the cinematic aspects of filmmaking come together in Raging Bull it offers a truly brilliant cinematic experience, which will leave the audience in awe for a very long time.
I:8391;699;At least Robert DeNiro won Best Actor .
I:8391;700;Not only does this movie stand the test of time, but its considered the greatest movie of the 80s (which I have to agree).
I:8391;701;Even though this movie was done in black and white and is quite violent, I really enjoyed the story.
I:8391;702;This is Scorsese's finest moment.
I:8391;703;A poetic work that mixes the deeply personal story of a boxer with unbelievable directorial style.
I:8391;704;The movie's fighting scene's are something to behold.
I:8391;705;He has to constantly prove that he can fight and be a 'contender.'
I:8391;706;He struggles with the notion that his girl finds another boxer attractive.
I:8391;707;He is alone and decreped.
I:8391;708;This movie is a touching and brutal look at a fighter.
I:8391;709;It is a hallmark movie in terms of its style and film work, but more improtantly it shows us the tragic fate of a man not being able to come to terms with his own worth and manhood.
I:8391;710;Meticulous attention to detail and proper use of black and white photography gives this story of the self.
I:8391;711;This movie is one of the best movies ever produced and directed for american cinemas.
I:8391;712;Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are electric together on screen.
I:8391;713;They are able to accurately portray their characters while still keeping true to the story of Jake La Motta's life.
I:8391;714;The movie is helped by the fact that Jake La Motta was one of the best fighters to ever enter the ring.
I:8391;715;His book which inspired the movie, was excellent and enthralling.
I:8391;716;Scorcese's use of black and white documentary style filmmaking gives this movie an almost voyeuristic viewpoint into the true life of a great man and the people in his life.
I:8391;717;Martin Scorsese makes the movie a enjoyable experience that makes you understand what you need in order to get a title shot, keep it, and deal with everything else.
I:8391;718;The powerful, memorable piece was a perfect example of true perfection.
I:8391;719;Raging Bull is the most commemorating experience in American Film history.
I:8391;720;This was an experience which will make you cry and understand that this movie is truly a perfect picture.
I:8391;721;De Niro's best movie produced.
I:8391;722;i watched it when it come to the big screen and it is still one of my all time favorites
I:8391;723;Movie was entertaining and interesting as we did not know much about personal life of this fighter who we followed when we were much younger.
I:8391;724;This movie is another Scorsese masterpiece and should be on the best movie lists of all film buffs.
I:8391;725;The film is by a mile the best sports film EVER!
I:8391;726;gREAT DIRECTOR, The story line was very very good Robert Dinero is awesome.
I:8391;727;I highly recommend this movie to all
I:8391;728;What makes a movie great?
I:8391;729;The answers to those questions will determine your reaction to this movie.
I:8391;730;I haven't yet seen a realistic boxing scene in a movie.
I:8391;731;And that moment with Robinson raising one fist slowly.
I:8391;732;fans in a dream world.
I:8391;733;if you enjoy that scene because it shows how the hero ignored his own safety and opened himself up to pain, and you like identifying with that macho behavior, well go have a beer and picture yourself as this character.
I:8391;734;So many people are calling Raging Bull one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8391;735;Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, this 1980 academy award winner is a well.
I:8391;736;we watch LaMotta through several years of his career, see his ups and downs and his demons within.
I:8391;737;The dialog is perfect New York.
I:8391;738;The details of the setting, right down to the crucifix over the bed and the glitz of the Cocacabana nightclub capture the subtleties of the times.
I:8391;739;No wonder he won an academy award!
I:8391;740;Every detail of his character is explored, from his eye movements and facial expressions to his expanding belly.
I:8391;741;She's blond and beautiful with a coarse New York accent that underlines the gritty scene.
I:8391;742;applause to Martin Scorsese and the film editor for putting it all together!
I:8391;743;This is filmmaking at its very best.
I:8391;744;Deniro is awesome, cool history clips, love joe pecci, I wish I didn't have to write a essay on why I like this movie
I:8391;745;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are absolutely brilliant as a pair of brothers in the streets of New York City who get drawn into the violent world of boxing.
I:8391;746;You can hear that gritty upbringing in their accents, see it in the chain.
I:8391;747;de Niro channels that inner range and shows it spectacularly.
I:8391;748;Jake has had a hard life and he deserves something better.
I:8391;749;He mistreats his feisty girlfriend until a nubile blonde catches his eye .
I:8391;750;He could take the beating and remain on his feet.
I:8391;751;style """"he was a hero"""" story."""
752;while the characters are flawed, I think De Niro and Pesci are both superb at bringing them to life in a realistic way.
753;De Niro's weight gain is fairly impressive, from the beginning to the end of the movie.
754;That's dedication to one's craft.
755;still, an interesting insight into the world of Bronx boxing.
756;Scorsese with the finest actor portraying the life of Jake LaMotta, a must.
757;I thought at the time you were cinematic perfection as an actor.
758;recently, I bought this special anniversary edition and my opinion is the same.
759;The comments from Mr. Scorsese and others, notably Mr. La Motta, were intelligent and very interesting.
760;A movie that will remain the best in its genre, frozen in time, way up there among the great ones.
761;The attention to detail is scary by Scorsese and DeNiro's preperation to actually spend a year learning how to box is truly beyond belief!He boxed over 1000 rounds w/LaMotta alone!
762;Anyway, the greatest movie ever made has now, finally gotten the treatment it deserves!
763;What a joy to watch!
764;"Scorsese will never be a ""Hollywood"" director, but that's fine w/me Marty!"
765;Keep on giving us your New York, the REAL one!
766;Thank you for this masterpeice!
767;This is the best boxing movie.
768;It has the most intense fight scenes.
769;The story line is also very powerful.
770;I also recomend the book of the same name.
771;Seeing it now is a revelation.
772;I am able to comprehend it more and found it wonderful.
773;Robert De Niro does a wonderful job as Jake LaMotta, one of the great boxers but an ignorant man who was brutal in all areas of his life.
774;What a wonderful film it is.
775;Scorsese's best film is extrodinarily compelling to the highest level.
776;RAGING BULL is one of the greatest films made on the face of this earth.
777;Scorsese's brilliant direction, the classic, moving score, the seamless film editing, the searing perfomances, everything.
778;His richly deserved Oscar win for Best Actor was the Academy's best choice, because no other nominated actor for that award was even close to matching DeNiro's performance that year.
779;He was aboslutely perfect for the role, and it is a crime to say that he was bad in this film.
780;inculding Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are also incredible.
781;Great movie love the fight scenes with Ray Robinson.
782;Just all around great acting though.
783;"The direction and acting are top notch but without a worthy individual to tell about the end result is a big ""so what?"""
784;It's an older movie but we still enjoyed watching it.
785;Thought it was suspenseful and held our interest.
786;One of my favorite movies.
787;great acting, great directing, and great story.
788;The true story of La Motta who is played by Robert De Niro who is possibly the best actor of his generation.
789;"Co. starring Joe Pesci as De Niro's brother
I:8391;790;Raging Bull is an incredible film featuring some of the greatest directing, cinematography, and acting ever to grace the silver screen.
I:8391;791;Such an incredible movie also has to have a strong foundation in the form of a powerful script, moving music and incredible set work.
I:8391;792;In all, this is a movie that comes together on all fronts, and it's a credit to Scorcese for making that happen.
I:8391;793;jake LaMotta is a fighter who relies on his physical gifts over his mind.
I:8391;794;His decline is a metaphor for his personal life as well.
I:8391;795;But this film is great because of its honesty.
I:8391;796;Deniro's portrayal of LaMotta is legendary.
I:8391;797;joe Pesci gives a strong performance in his supporting role as Jake's brother Joey.
I:8391;798;Cathy Moriarty gives an incredible performance as Jake's Wife.
I:8391;799;She is very believable throughout the entire movie, as the wild young sexpot and the resolute divorcee.
I:8391;800;the fight scenes bring out the best in the film's cinematography.
I:8391;801;Every scene is expertly framed in the ring with realism and sharp contrast.
I:8391;802;The music is perfectly timed with the action, highlighting the beauty and brutality of this blood sport.
I:8391;803;the rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson is expertly done.
I:8391;804;This is an incredible edition as well, with great clarity and nice features.
I:8391;805;Robert Deniro once again shows that he is up to any part and makes you believe.
I:8391;806;it shows the gritty underbelly of professional fighting and perhaps this is the reasonthat pro boxing has been in decline for years.
I:8391;807;all in all a must see, especially for guys
I:8391;808;This is such a great movie.
I:8391;809;It is story telling at its finnest.
I:8391;810;I tink Martin S. is a genius.
I:8391;811;DeNIro is a genius as well
I:8391;812;A real story by people that lived it then have a greate cast to put it on silver screen, I really enjoyed the the life like performance of the cast, a must see.
I:8391;813;Engaging, beautifully crafted biography of middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta.
I:8391;814;The cinematography employs monochrome instead of colour, a great idea because it perfectly mirrors LaMotta's dark persona.
I:8391;815;DeNiro is so convincing as LaMotta, that I ask myself sometimes if the personality he assumed for Raging Bull was how he must have once been himself.
I:8391;816;Another amazing thing DeNiro's sheer determination to accurately portray LaMotta in his post.
I:8391;817;Joe Pesci is perfectly suited to the role of LaMotta's brother and manager, Joey, a quick talking, foul.
I:8391;818;Cathy Moriarty excels as Vicki LaMotta, Jake's supportive, strong and tolerant wife.
I:8391;819;the movie is a classic example of near flawless film.
I:8391;820;The screenplay is based on LaMotta's autobiography and of course that gives the dialogue a realistic and true to life feel.
I:8391;821;Elegant black and white enhances the already brilliant cinematography throughout the film, characterised by picturesque, static camera shots, sharply juxtaposed with the vibrant and kinetic camera work of the fight scenes.
I:8391;822;Scorsese expertly creates some very tense moments throughout the film, such as the 'You're telling me all these answers Joey, but none of them are the right answer' bit and his use of slow motion at certain moments help convey LaMotta's interpretation of events, such as Vicki giving a normal, everyday goodbye kiss to a departing visitor, a sight that makes Jake immediately think that Vicki may be seeing that person behind his back.
I:8391;823;There are very few films that are first class in all aspects of production.
I:8391;824;De Niro turns in an extarodanary, best actor oscar.
I:8391;825;winning performance as Jake La Motta, a boxer whose pscylogical ans sexual complexities erupt into violence both in and out of the ring.
I:8391;826;Nominated for best supporting ator and actress oscars.
I:8391;827;Tough, compelling, and powerful made"
828;and striaght to the heart.
829;the movie is flawless as you see Jake LaMotta's soul and career being torn apart by himself through an amazing performance from Robert De Niro.
830;A performance that I would say is the best of all.
831;With the help of Jake LaMotta himself, Martin Scorsese has delievered a movie with awesome black and white cinematography, great boxing visuals (some of the most powerful you'll see in film) and top.
832;notch performances from the entire cast.
833;We thought that the movie was very good.
834;It held our interest from beginning to end.
835;This movie was voted best movie of the decade for a reason.
836;The supporting cast is perfect.
837;The fight scenes are perfect.
838;Excellent 2 disc treatment of this classic from Scorsese.
839;The addition of Joe Pesci is always wonderful.
840;the era that the real Jake LaMotta competed in was one of the most interesting in history.
841;His brutal defeat at the hands of Ray Robinson in the 13th round of their sixth and final match, which he had been winning on points, is a good example of this.
842;all this outside the ring drama, this weight gain and weight loss, this constant pressure to perform did not help his mental state, and DeNiro does a masterful job of showing how the same qualities which made LaMotta successful as a fighter ultimately wrecked him as a person.
843;In Raging Bull Scorsese made one of those movies that transcends its subject and becomes an instant classic, and DeNiro gave one of those performances which stands out even in a career as distinguished and brilliant as his.
844;this movie begins one of the great feuds of cinematic history, between Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent.
845;Raging Bull is an American classic film that portrays the rise and self destruction of boxer Jake LaMotta (played by Robert Dinero).
846;Raging Bull is, in my opinion, regarded as great because it is tragic.
847;Most films of this sort will give you a happy ending where everyone is getting along in the end.
848;Also, Scorsese does a great job with the boxing scenes.
849;as for the extras, they are very good.
850;The disc two features are all worth watching.
851;The commentaries on disc one are pretty well done, but I was really hoping for one with Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci.
852;Despite this, Raging Bull is well worth your money.
853;Jammed with special features, including three excellent audio commentaries and about two hours worth of documentaries about making the film.
854;Excellent classic movie with young stars.
855;I liked that the movie was filmed in black and white, to add the raw edge of boxing.
856;like grace, about hypermasculinity and the American Dream.
857;Loved it until the very end.
858;the first 99.9% of the film was pretty damn good, though.
859;Cited by many critics as the best film of the decade, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece opened to critical reviews but was essentially shunned by audiences.
860;It is based on real life champion middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta whose career spanned from the early 40's to the mid.1950's.
861;As one of the excellent special features shows, the filmmakers were meticulous in recreating the fights with an almost punch.
862;Robert De Niro won the Oscar for best actor in the role of LaMotta.
863;It is a remarkable performance that must have taken its toll.
864;Joe Pesci is brilliant as Jake's brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty in her first acting job plays Vickie, Jake's underage wife.
865;This is also the film's brilliance.
866;The black and white transfer looks terrific but does show some grain as it should.
867;Robert De Niro at his all time best, and that's saying something.
868;Not only is his acting some of the best ever, but the sixty pound weight gain is truly an amazing feat for an actor.
869;"This is my choice for the best sports film ever made, followed by Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby."""
870;All the acting here is top notch, especially Joe Pesci in his breakout role and Cathy Moriarty as Jake La Motta's wife.
871;"Martin Scorsese was at his best with ""Raging Bull"" and it is my favorite film of his followed closely by ""Goodfellas."""
872;An excellent transfer of Scorsese' masterpiece.
873;The extras included on the disc are outstanding .
874;The documentary that compares Lamotta and Deniro is amazing.
875;Cathy Moriarty as the petulant wife does a good job working Jake into a lather.
876;This is just a wonderful set that have made for this landmark movie.
877;This is one of my favorite movies because it is so brutal in scope and nature, that it is somehow comes out being pretty.
878;"At first I thought, ""Boxing movie?"
879;Robert De Niro's portrayal of La Motta was well done, but being well.
880;I am well aware that the boxing wasn't the main focus of this film, but a director of Scorsese's caliber should have been able to make it slightly interesting.
881;I also ordered Taxi Driver and Good Fellas as my back up for movie night.
882;"And Bobby Deniro should have won the award for ""Best Actor""."
883;nonetheless, being heralded as the best movie of the 80's is a well.
884;Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance is only one of the many highlights of Raging Bull: Martin Scorsese's classic portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta.
885;De Niro's transformation into LaMotta is still one of the greatest things to be seen in cinematic history, and 25 years later, the only performance to come close to the visceral ferocity of De Niro's is Charlize Theron in Monster.
886;The fight scenes are incredibly re.
887;Raging Bull is a frank account of the boxing career of Jake LaMotta, which is characterized by intensity to win and some of the mishaps LaMotta faced during and after his career.
888;Robert De Niro plays LaMotta with fierce accuracy and he won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Actor.
889;This is one of the best boxing films of all.
890;Wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't my cup of tea.
891;From throwing a fight, to abusing his wife, letting himself go, and finally ending up in jail for an incident involving an underage girl.
892;On a positive note, the movie is beautifully shot, the fight scenes are very well done and DeNiro's transformation throughout the film is amazing stuff.
893;Raging Bull (1980) is, bar none, the best work that director, Martin Scorsese has ever done in American cinema.
894;The evocative black and white (except for rare color sequence) cinematography really captures the mood and feel of old time boxing news reels.
895;Of course the other half that makes the story sparkle like no other sports movie before or since, and cannot be overstated, is Robert DeNiro's masterful performance as Jake.
896;The line between character and actor is so poignantly blurred that the performance stands out as genuine and raw in its reverence and sincerity to both LaMotta and the sport.
897;The rest of the cast, hand picked by Scorsese for their non.
898;"DeNiro rightfully took home the Best Actor Oscar for ""Raging Bull""."
899;Scorsese and the film were wrongfully overlooked.
900;"mGM/UA has given us a stunning new transfer of ""Raging Bull""."
901;The black and white image is smooth, beautifully contrasted and very nicely balanced.
902;Blacks are deep and rich.
903;The faded color sequences, deliberately rendered that way, are poignant snapshots of a private life that add yet another layer to the telling of this tale.
904;The audio, remixed to 5.1, like the Raging Bull himself, packs an incredible one/two wallop.
905;The sound field is engaging, intense and always on pitch.
906;Extras include a string of interesting documentaries that chart the film from conception to post production.
907;There's even a side by side LaMotta to DeNiro fight sequence to compare styles in fighting.
908;Beyond the incredible camerawork, scenery, casting and direction.
909;RB is a movie that picks you up and carries you through all the way to the end, and leaves you wanting more.
910;A superb film in every way, and definitely one of the finest boxing films in existence.
911;Boring and not much of a gripping story.
912;This is the best sports film you will ever be privied to.
913;Robert Deniro is at the top of his game here and it makes the film all the better.
914;scorese hit the nial on the head here, it is quite possibly his best film, and may remain so for years to come.
915;The casting by Corman was great and every character was perfect in their interations with Deniro, it looked so natural!!
916;It was the best film of the 1980's according to AFI and deserves that recognition.
917;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci deliver first rate acting performances in this must see classic film.
918;The story line really keeps your interest.
919;1 of De Niro and Pesci finest collaboration.
920;Great storyline and insight into the world of an up and coming boxer.
921;the highlight of Raging Bull, as many have said, is the performances.
922;Every role is perfect and very convincing, from Cathy Moriarty as Jake's low.
923;mouthed, often hilarious brother, Joey.
924;changing as a depiction of a man who has the facade of an animal but is very human deep down.
925;a lot of people are misguided in thinking that having fierce will and determination, is admirable.
926;i'm extremely surprised that this movie is considered one of the best movies of all time.
927;The truth be told, Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull stands up there in the ranks of Kubrick's cinematography style.
928;The editing and acting are all unique and extremely genuine.
929;Shot in black and white you will see De Niro dance around the ring as Jake LaMotta scoring blows in some remarkably realistic performing.
930;A press photographer's bulb flashes, an eye gets cut, blood squirts out, the crowd roar, the commentator goes wild, another bulb flashes, a slow motion sequence, De Niro utters some fantastic lines in the middle of a bout, then does it all again.
931;It doesn't make for very pleasurable viewing and certainly you can say .
932;But this is drama and in many ways it is, but that is all Scorsese really explores here and after awhile you do get bored of it all and you don't really take anything much of value away with you after seeing it.
933;surprisingly this is one of Scorsese's turkeys on the drama front.
934;Nowhere does Scorsese's pictures come closer to being fowl.
935;The film also stalls a lot of the time and in many ways those who say that they did not like Raging Bull have good reason too.
936;This is well below what Scorsese is capable off.
937;Robert De Niro gives the greatest single performance I've ever seen.
938;It is a powerful movie but at the same time subtle and charming.
939;The cinematography is absolutely brilliant (boxing scenes) and the dialogue is pitch.
940;I'd love to see Joe Pesci and De Niro in a Shakespeare film.
941;Now, it is OK movie.
942;Raging Bull is at times disturbing, depressing, charming, comical, and intriguing.
943;for all of his emotional ups and downs, Jake LaMotta is an interesting and compelling character and DeNiro does an amazing job in portraying him.
944;If you like a dark movie that explores every facet of the human dimension, this movie is for you.
945;Though the relatively recent Wolf of Wall Street may have come close to dethroning Raging Bull, this still remains the undeniably greatest film in Scorsese's extraordinary filmography, and also arguably the greatest film of the 80s.
946;This film is about the personal and professional life of boxer Jake La Motta, played by Robert de Niro.
947;ups, lighting, reminds me of great classical films but the depiction is all Scorsese.
948;If it's Italian, got plenty of swearing, smart guys, pretty girls and violence it's bound to be Scorsese.
949;De Niro plays the role to perfection as you feel the impact of La Motta's emotions.
950;raging Bull is one of my favourite films by Martin Scorsese because it's more realistic.
951;Raging Bull is possibly the finest boxing film that you can see, and have to see.
952;The film won two oscars, one for Robert De Niro and one for Thelma Schoonmaker for best editing.
953;This is considered Martin Scorsese's best feature, and possibly his most popular and most acclaimed film to date.
954;This film is shot in a beautiful black and white picture and also has colour footage in only one segmant of the film.
955;He's taking a beating, but turns around to knock out the other fighter.
956;The film is a telling of his rise and fall of the boxing world and his personal life.
957;Remember, this is all based on true events, and is all from a book based on Jake LaMotta's boxing career.
958;the cast and crew's efforts to make brilliance are accomplished with a brilliant performance by De Niro, where he put on weight, trained with Jake LaMotta and could've actually been a professional boxer, he was wonderful as LaMotta and definately deserved the oscar for best actor.
959;Joe Pesci's excellent performance as Jake's supportive brother Joey is not a weak performance at all, their chemistry on screen is wonderful to watch, and you get a clear idea of how they got along and how they fought in their personal lives involving boxing, family, friends, and Vickie, Joe Pesci was nominated for best supporting actor as Joey.
960;She is also a stunning example of fine acting when under pressure with great actors and a great director on board.
961;She is another actress that's showed great chemistry on screen with her fellow actors and their characters, she is actually the perfect Vickie, a brilliant casting choice, she was nominated for best supporting actress as Vickie.
962;The script is a great piece of writing and storytelling, with character writing and story plot that creates tension, love, loyalty, betrayel, and distrust between the characters.
963;The cinematography is an eye opener here, and keeps you focused and inlove with the film, plot, and it's characters, with brilliant camera work in the boxing scenes(only used one camera in each fight scene), and an excellent switch from black and white to colour during the home video footage of them.
964;Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is some of the finest editing ever, with complex fight scenes put together, and just carefuly put together with a love for the film.
965;Scorsese's direction is indeed noteworthy, he managed to guide inexperienced actors like Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty through a tough task of a very technical and important film.
966;His imagination for the perfect fight scenes, visuals, and performances caused stressful problems, especially the boxing sequences with one camera, but paid off with his most perfectly made film that will be remembered in cinema history for generations to come.
967;The music is classical music that gives the film another beautiful edge to it, finishing off the film's perfection.
968;the cast and crew's blood, sweat and tears are rewarded with a film that pleases audiences with rivetting performances, stunning visuals, brilliant direction, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography.
969;The use of drama and exilarating boxing scenes blend well with dialogue, story, and beautiful music.
970;A beautiful film in every aspect, and will bring you back time and time again to crave your lust for more black and white films you don't get too often, and makes you wonder why Scorsese hasn't won an oscar yet.
971;This is a film anyone can enjoy, and will find a place in your heart.
972;"It has a highly detailed, but greatly awarded commentry by all the people who were involved in the film(including Scorsese and Jake LaMotta), it has a feature called ""Before the Fight"", which is another rewarding doc about the casting, writing and preproduction of the film, with how they started the idea to adapt LaMotta's biography."
973;Inside the Ring contains the highly detailed look at how the actors trained and prepared for each carefully planned boxing fight, as well as the extremely tough shooting of each fight that was carefully planned and expertly finnished.
974;Outside the Ring is simply a behind the scenes look at the film, and all the interesting stories and facts that happened on the sets and production period.
975;After the Fight is a look at the impact that the film made on audiences, and a look at how the sound and music were carefully planned together.
976;De Niro vs. LaMotta is shot by shot comparison with De Niro and the real LaMotta in the ring, this bassicly follows the accuracy of the film.
977;There's also newsreel footage of Jake LaMotta and the original theatrical trailer.
978;This is the definitive edition of Raging Bull, and is a brilliant set with an excellent film and brilliant extra features.
979;Scorsese is good and getting Pesci and Deniro together is a no brainer.
980;This movie takes you along his journy.
981;Raging Bull is a wonderfully made movie about a life hardly worth telling about.
982;Robert De Niro poured himself into the role of Jake La Motta as much and as well as any actor possibly could.
983;Raging Bull established Robert De Niro as the preeminent actor of his generation and one of the best of all.
984;He explodes off the screen as he takes us through the highs and lows of Mr. LaMotta's life from being middleweight champion of the world to being a second rate lounge act.
985;He is fierce, bitter, angry, touching and becomes somewhat sympathetic near the end.
986;In addition, an 18 year old Cathy Moriarty makes an impressive debut as his abused wife and Joe Pesci, in one of his earliest roles, plays his tormented brother.
987;De Niro was great, going from a top middkeweight Champ to a washed up, overweight, nighclub act.
988;it was a perfect story perhaps of the boxer.
989;As intense as the violence is, the best thing that can be said is that it is not gratuitous.
990;Raging Bull is a masterly crafted piece of work invoking the zeitgeist of an era.
991;Robert De Niro proved to be a master of his craft in his portrayal of the boxer.
992;He is an actor's actor.
993;The directing, the camera work, the editing, everything about this movie is just wonderful.
994;Watch it, enjoy it, or go sit in the corner and suck your thumb.
995;On the short list of the greatest American movies ever made and also on the short list of the greatest acting jobs w/ De Niro's incredible performance of the troubled La Motta.
996;The cinematography and choreography of the boxing sequences are stunning.
997;Along w/ Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, the finest Scorcese films.
998;The filming of this movie in black and white was a master stroke.
999;The film grain has been reproduced beautifully.
1000;pick, this looks just like watching it at the movie theater, but with a pristine print.
1001;One of the greatest films has been given a great restoration and now looks its very best on blu.
1002;Deniro does a great job and Joe Pesi also.
1003;As a period piece this gains authenticity by the use of black and white film.
1004;A good story about a great fighter.
1005;The Blue Ray takes it to a new level in clarity as you would expect.
1006;This movie should be in everyone's permanent collection because of the extremely well written story, extraordinary acting by De Niro and what was put into this to make it successful.
1007;"rigged over night and movies tend to rely so heavily on celebrity recognition and special effects, the inside perspectives of those who made ""Raging Bull"" is so refreshing."
1008;with respect to the actors, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci provided the most interesting angles.
1009;nominated celebrity for her role as Vickie LaMatta.
1010;as for the movie itself, it is a masterpiece.
1011;Nobody can swear as well as DeNiro, and he lets them fly throughout.
1012;Gory, graphic and tragic, but somehow lyrical, emotional and deeply provoking, Raging Bull is an all time masterpiece.
1013;Despite what is in the theatres nowadays, this movie reminds you that movies can still be artistic and made with loving care.
1014;I really liked the whole black and white footage!
1015;Not only is it awesome because Robert De Niro is in it.
1016;But because it also stars Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty and is directed by Martin Scorsese.
1017;i can't guarantee to you that you'll like this film, because I found it to be a little boring too, but if you like De Niro films, this is a good one to see.
1018;but never made anything one iota as good as that one ever again !)
1019;it was interesting in the early scenes to see how far the raging bull character had descended.
1020;he is so dedicated and such a brilliant actor you want to believe you are seeing something great .
1021;he even made a great movie.
1022;brilliant except for the totally miscast mamby pamby boss of paul sorvino who actually tried to turn down the plum role.
1023;a wonderful touching movie .
1024;so i respect the guy for those two gems and taxi driver was close to being good it certainly had its moments.
1025;mean streets was interesting if also amatuerish but at least it had a freshness back then.
1026;enough already aggrandizing these( with all due respect !!!!! )
1027;The acting and the photography of the fight sequences are quite good.
1028;free and well worth watching.
1029;Martin Scorsese has directed many films showing the grit and passion found in the underside of American life.
1030;"Among the best of his movies is ""Raging Bull"" (1980) which tells the story of middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, played in a stunning performance by Robert De Niro."
1031;I loved the movie when it was released and have finally seen it again.
1032;Pesci and Moriarty were unknowns and both turned in stellar performances.
1033;the film captures the raw world of professional boxing, with its pervasive criminal element.
1034;But the film shows an individual who has a degree of ability to reflect on his life and to achieve a measure of redemption.
1035;A Biblical passage at the end of the film suggests the possibility of forgiveness with time and repentance.
1036;Raging Bull is a story about the harder parts of American life combining an unsparing message with the possibility of hope.
1037;I enjoyed revisiting the movie at last and remembering why I loved it when seeing it many years ago.
1038;Every boxing movie fan should agree that the best boxing movie ever is Raging Bull.
1039;Raging Bull is a finely made movie, with great performances including Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty.
1040;But i'm glad that De Niro got it.
1041;The acting and direction are outstanding.
1042;Try to name a more influential film.
1043;Also terrific for couples who suspect they have problems maintaining a healthy marriage.
1044;The ladies DO love a confident man who is a success in his chosen career, is a good provider, and is attentive to the little things.
1045;One of the ten best films ever made.
1046;The best performance of all time (Robert De Niro).
1047;A brilliant masterpiece of cinema.
1048;This is filmmaking at it's best.
1049;Let me begin with the greatest actor working today.
1050;whenever Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese get together it's cinematic gold.
1051;Only years prior they created the iconic character of Travis Bickle.
1052;Now, in 1980, they create another iconic screen character: Jake La Motta.
1053;i highly recommend this movie.
1054;disc Special Edition),Cape Fear (10th Anniversary Edition), andCasino), Scorsese and De Niro have created memorable characters.
1055;Jake La Motta just may well top the list.
1056;And the featurettes are wonderful.
1057;I dont recommended it on Blu.
1058;I never saw this movie when it came out, so decided to watch it as Robert Di Nero is one of my favorite actors.
1059;Now that requires a rare talent that big name hollywood directors are yet to master.
1060;good Movie but I cannot allow such filth into my home .
1061;The cinematography of many scenes is beautiful.
1062;The montage in color is pretty spectacular and breaks up the movie quite nicely.
1063;Robert De Niro is spectaculer.
1064;This is the best Boxing movie of all time.
1065;The Film: First of all, I loved 'Raging Bull'.
1066;It is a great story about a man who had everything and lost it all.
1067;The film is about Jake LaMotta, a boxer who can take a beating in the ring and win with it.
1068;ending urge to prove himself right.
1069;Robert De Niro did this roll so well.
1070;The film is such a great one with the most spectacular fight scenes ever seen.
1071;It comes with a trailer and the movie.
1072;Plus, the movie gives you the option of widescreen and pan and scan.
1073;The movie that should have won picture of the year in 1980, but the Academy was probably too shocked and repulsed to award it.
1074;So it won for Best Editing and Best Actor.
1075;Does anyone remember the picture that won for 1980?
1076;Which by itself is a very good picture.
1077;"That is the power of ""Raging Bull""."
1078;But he could possibly be considered the Mike Tyson of his era.
1079;"Now all we need is ""Taxi Driver"" with the Criterion LD commentary, and all will be right."
1080;First, in terms of boxing footage, this is simply the most gripping biopic you may ever see.
1081;third, and most importantly, De Niro and Joe Pesci are astounding in how well they wear the skin of brothers from the Bronx.
1082;De Niro bags most of the credit when people speak of this classic, and his performance truly is soul churning, but Pesci matches that brilliance with his effortless turn as a brother/manager too.
1083;Good storyline, acting, visually captivating.
1084;In 1980 a film was released that made cinematic history.
1085;Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring the great Robert De Niro, Raging Bull was released and caused jaws to drop throughout the film world.
1086;It recieved rave reviews and was also nominated for plenty of Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.
1087;They did though give Robert De Niro his well deserved Best Actor award.
1088;Robert De Niro plays Jake La Motta, an Italian Bronx fighter that is constantly battling not only his opponents, but also himself.
1089;He is constantly accusing his wife or adultry which eventually drives her away from him.
1090;There are some of the best boxing scenes ever caught on film in this movie, especially during La Motta's fights with Sugar Ray Robinson.
1091;at the end of the 80's a poll that was given to tons of film critics revealed that the majority of them felt that Raging Bull was the best picture of the 80's.
1092;Overall, Raging Bull has all of the key elements that not only make up a good movie but also one of the best of films of our time.
1093;two thumbs up for this classic!
1094;Probably Robert deneiros most intense performance in film (along with cab driver)
1095;This is quite possibly the best sports movie ever made.
1096;I still see this movie as I viewed it in the theatre.
1097;The boxing scenes are incredible.
1098;The film editing was well deserved of an Oscar.
1099;What it should have also won for was Best Sound.
1100;It is a wild ride!
1101;Couple that with the great perfomances of DeNiro, Pesci and Moriarty and you have one of the greatest biopics ever made.
1102;Jake LaMotta:one of the most talented and successful boxers of his time.
1103;Also,one of the most turbulent boxers of his time,who's personal life would,eventually,work its way into his career.
1104;It's like watching an actual fight,De Niro and all of the actors having their complete emotion rolled into it.
1105;"The suspense and ""beauty"" really work well here."
1106;the parts that focus on La Motta's personal life stand out quite well,also.
1107;Raging Bull succeeds on focusing on every other person of Jake La Motta's life and giving them enough recognition,without forgetting who the film is about.
1108;"Joe Pesci can get annoying at times,but otherwise,the acting in ""Raging Bull"" is richly executed and contributes to the beauty of the film."
1109;it's worth noting that most of(minus about ten.
1110;"You see what the life of Jake La Motta was completely like,the time period for which it was being documented the way it is helping a lot(history fans are in for a treat with this aspect of ""Raging Bull"")."
1111;"disc,special edition of ""Raging Bull""."
1112;It's a very successful method.
1113;shot comparison of Robert De Niro and Jake La Motta are impressive touches.
1114;Raging Bull is probably the greatest movie about a boxer ever made.
1115;The picture is now more stunning that ever for home viewing in blu.
1116;I give it my highest recommendation.
1117;Great cast and so brilliantly shot.
1118;deNiro and Pesci are at their very best
1119;He's at his best .
1120;Raging Bull is one of those rare films that shows life as it actually is: gritty and sometimes very ugly.
1121;With this film director Martin Scorsese has dived deep into what makes us human and shown it to us very honestly.
1122;He has a fight with his wife and he even seems to enjoy it.
1123;In most films of the modern age, the ending of an otherwise good movie is comprised and made happy.
1124;The characters are all real and Scorsese knew this.
1125;And what makes this film so very good is that you thought that was how he would end up.
1126;Robert De Niro plays the part of La Motta with sheer excellence and Joe Pesci as his brother is just as good.
1127;Get it and watch it again and again.
1128;Deniro is one of the best actors of all time.
1129;i bought the special edition and absolutely enjoyed the special features, though it won't drive me back to watch the film again.
1130;I must say I enjoyed it!
1131;DeNiro captures the role of this volatile and sad human being perfectly.
1132;The content was excellent in its presentation.
1133;I went into this film expecting a lot, since it was voted the best movie of the 80s, not to mention that it had Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
1134;I seriously was shocked with De Niro's appearance.
1135;I also give credit to the filmmaking by Scorsesse.
1136;The choice to film in black and white was a good one.
1137;Their are some excellent shots during the boxing sequences, the one that stands out in my mind the most is the blood dripping off the rope of the ring.
1138;But to say that this movie is one of the best movies ever made is a huge overstatement.
1139;Really, its good, but not THAT great.
1140;amazing body evolution, fat to thin and back.
1141;I see why it received all of its accolades!
1142;This movie is pure brilliance.
1143;De Niro is one of my favorite actors and this is a movie I've wanted to see for a long time.
1144;it was worth the wait.
1145;Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are great in this too.
1146;Every aspect of this movie is brilliant.
1147;Pesci, De Niro,Martin Scorsese what else do you need to know, watch it .
1148;I saw this fantastic movie again recently, seemed every bit as good this time as when I saw it in the theater in 1980 or so.
1149;I don't care much for boxing, but this movie, made in black and white for authenticity, is a riveting story based on the true life of the boxer LaMotta.
1150;One of the best boxing movies ever.
1151;Its a must watch movie!
1152;RAGING BULL is a legend.
1153;Out of all of the films of the 1980's, on a great many occasions it has come out to be number one.
1154;RAGING BULL is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece drama that tells the true.
1155;life story of heavyweight champion Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro in one of his greatest performances.
1156;smart brother (Joe Pesci), and faces undeserved defeat.
1157;"De Niro is outstanding
I:8391;1158;Scorsese's directing also excellent .
I:8391;1159;Flawless characterization, not one single bad scene, many memorable good scenes, first rated editing, cinematography, acting, screenwriting, and, of course, direction.
I:8391;1160;On a more personal level, the story and character bring a deeply felt resonance in my heart.
I:8391;1161;Time and again I come back to this movie, and it works everytime I watch it.
I:8391;1162;It never dates, but gets better with time, because the portrayal of Jake is realistic and humanistic.
I:8391;1163;Some filmmakers are to be admired for their sheer ingenious exercise in film technique"
1164;Scorsese is the perfect master in filmmaking.
1165;He has good stories to tell, and he told them better than anyone else.
1166;the harshness and often brutal life of middle weight champion is brought to chilling life by De Niro .
1167;but it all goes towards an outstanding performance and a well deserved Oscar.
1168;ever that this is the best film of the 1980's.
1169;This was a great movie that was very low priced!
1170;I've been wanting to watch it since I am a fan of classics, and Amazon allowed me to do so inexpensively!
1171;A classic DeNiro movie !!
1172;It still showcases DeNiro's great acting skills
1173;this was a fine film back in 1980 in its original form.
1174;like many fine dramas of that era it has since fallen victim to politically correct censorship, which is done to gut the films of realism and power.
1175;This kind of thing has been done to many films of the past.
1176;can't recommend censored art work.
1177;It was a really great movie.
1178;Also was great to see a neighbor in it.
1179;You will enjoy this movie.
1180;the greatest tradgity of all time was when it lost the academy award to the Ordinary People in 1980.
1181;Other than that it is very suitable and I watch it over and over again along with all of my favorite french films from the 50's.
1182;He's no Stallone, but held his own in his scenes with Pesci, a much more talented, gifted actor.
1183;"Pesci is the best thing about this flick
I:8391;1184;Again, it was decent, and I give it five stars because of Pesci, but where are the cuts?
I:8391;1185;*Scorcese's not that bad a director check out his masterpiece, the Cape Fear remake, his best film.
I:8391;1186;The special feature that I can't possible wait to see is the commentary by Martin.
I:8391;1187;All the more, it takes a director, the caliber of Scorsese to make De Niro do all of these things.
I:8391;1188;scorsese is a master of disturbing movies.
I:8391;1189;His movies are subtle, yet disturbing.
I:8391;1190;In """"Raging Bull"""", he has perfectly captured the deranged character of Jack La Motta, and has chosen the perfect person to enact this character."""
1191;Each moment of La Motta's various fights seems to be crafted diligently and with perfection.
1192;white look of the movie, enhancing the subfusc nature of it, actually helps one, focus fully on the intensity of the characters, especially since everything else around them seem so livid and wan.
1193;In fact, the `colored' part, is the only positive part of the movie, which actually is a phantasmagoria of shots, showing positive things happening to lives of the Motta brothers.
1194;But, it is one of those movies, which is ought to be `studied' for its brilliant direction (especially the non.
1195;usage of color producing greater effect) and the acting, especially of Robert De Niro, who did seem to actually put a on lot of weight for the movie.
1196;What are great films made of, what do they have to contain that makes them so remarkable ?
1197;A moving story, great acting, superb camerawork, exceptional sound, cleverly editing, masterful directions ?
1198;Its one of the best films ever made, and as with good wine it just gets better with each passing year.
1199;the meanest sunofabich ever to have played the main character in a film (at least in the 80's), honestly played by Robet De Niro who took method acting to new hights when he decided to get fit in order to play the boxer, and then gained 30.
1200;He gives his best performance ever, as he is able to bring out the sympathetic side of this monster.
1201;but eventually its the story that moves us.
1202;this film just works in so many layers.
1203;Its humane but never sentimental, very straight forward yet so intelligent.
1204;a must see for absolutely everyone.
1205;a flawless masterpieceIf you will only see one film for the rest of your life, see this one.
1206;The transfer is very good but not flawless.
1207;"there are some new special features for this edition including: ""Marty and Bobby"" featuring director and actor interviewed about how they ended up working on the film together (DeNiro brought the project to Scorsese)."
1208;"reflections of a Classic"" features four directors Neil LeBute, Richard Kelly and Kimberly Pierce discussing the influence and impact of the film."
1209;Remembering Jake allows us to listen in as the Veteran Boxer's Association of New York do their monthly get together and discuss Jake LaMotta.
1210;Marty on Film allows Scorsese to discuss his career as a director.
1211;"As interesting a drama as ""Ordinary People"" was Robert Redford's film can't hold a candle to the complex drama that was passed over for both best director and best picture."
1212;Raging Bull features Scorsese's cinematic gifts at their peak.
1213;The kinetic camera of Michael Chapman and Scorsese's unusual but powerful compositions capture the boxing ring in a way never quite seen before.
1214;He also captures the human element in the same way.
1215;Jake LaMotta's gift is his ability to punish himself for his sins.
1216;"Robert DeNiro's brilliant portrayal of LaMotta earned him a well deserved Oscar but without Scorsese's sharp as nails direction and the rich imagery of Michael Chapman's cinematography, ""Raging Bull"" would just have been another biopic about a famous boxer."
1217;a beautiful, detailed transfer brings out the rich shadows, dark blacks and bright whites of Michael Chapman's cinematography.
1218;Presented in an enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 and the original 2.0 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack, the detailed soundtrack sounds terrific with virtually no compression issues and great presence.
1219;"production footage Scorsese came to the conclusion that Irwin Winkler's suggestion to shoot the film in black and white was perfect for capturing the ""vintage"" look of the era."
1220;Schoonmaker also points out the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences between fights and how changing the design of the ring, the lighting and how the sequences reflected Jake's emotional state at the time.
1221;While the film was storyboarded, Scorsese primarily used them to help keep track of the way the film would ultimately look when put together.
1222;The teamsters working on the production shot these sequences.
1223;The Bronx Bull features Jake LaMotta discussing seeing the movie for the first time.
1224;DeNiro vs. LaMotta compares the reel world vs. the real world from still photos and archival footage.
1225;It shows the detail that Scorsese and DeNiro went into to recreate the look and feel of the real fights.
1226;a superb movie that lost the Oscar to the fine film Ordinary People on a technicality (the repulsive violence alienated much of the Academy's core members), Raging Bull proves to be the deeper, richer film of the two.
1227;This story of the great Jake La Motta of boxing fame.
1228;Here we see the raw emotion of what it takes to be a true champion.
1229;Director Martin Scorsese was born and raised in New York City.
1230;Scorses moves back into that same familiar territory in his 1980 jackpot triumph, Raging Bull.
1231;The black and white photography is perfect for the subject matter, a tough, mob.
1232;dominated atmosphere and the engrossing character study of a neighborhood product who fights his way to the middleweight championship of the world.
1233;jake La Motta succeeded to a champonship with his successful in the ring fighting, but this film reveals that there was a whole lot more fighting within his psyche and with those with whom he interacted outside the boxing ring, and those experiences were anything but successful.
1234;Robert De Niro gives a masterful performance as the troubled fighter who is riddled by paranoia, especially regarding his beautiful wife.
1235;Cathy Moriarity does an excellent job as the tormented wife who refuses to let her paranoiac husband walk over her.
1236;la Motta is driven by an irrational jealousy concerning the beautiful Vicky.
1237;At another point he accuses his brother, played capably by Joe Pesci, of having sex with his wife.
1238;one of the interesting aspects of De Niro's Oscar.
1239;winning performance is the way he actually packed on the pounds to play the overeating, boozing La Motta in his post.
1240;nosed film packs a solid punch.
1241;Scorsese stages the fight scenes with a lyrical, poetic style rather than aiming for the kind of gripping realism which prevailed in fight films such as The Setup and Somebody Up There Likes Me, solid hits, both of which were directed by Robert Wise, and that also merit attention.
1242;Martin Scorsese is unquestionably a great director, and this is a fine film.
1243;"psychotic character takes objection to another mobster's innocent comment that he finds Pesci ""funny""."
1244;What do you mean, I'm funny?
1245;It's hard enough for a screenwriter to pen high.
1246;You're my brother, I expect you to.
1247;"libs as a starting point and written ""believable"" dialog that came closer to the way the characters would likely have spoken in real life."
1248;"It is otherwise a magnificent movie, with beautiful cinematography that anyone who says ""I don't like films"" has to see."
1249;If you're not bothered by (in my view) the poor improvised dialog, you will doubtless find it a masterpiece.
1250;deNiro gives it his all and the photography is excellent, but over.
1251;give it a try once.
1252;Raging Bull is an instant classic and is imo the best of the tandem of Scorsese and DeNiro's work.
1253;What an amazing emotional journey Raging Bull takes us through as we see all of Jake's demons as he tries to be the best of the best.
1254;A truly great charachter study of a controlling man struggling to reach his ideal.
1255;Joe Pesci is great as Jake's brother and Cathy Moriarty is beautiful.
1256;5/5 and one of the top 15 films ever made.
1257;Very Good Story of true story boxer.
1258;The Acting Robert de niro makes this movie so alive.
1259;The classical music background during the fight scenes gives them a ballet.
1260;We see Jake gain a reluctant forgiveness from his brother Joey and his slow acceptance in the night club circuit as a rather bittersweet ending to this passionate tale.
1261;Like I said, it's the greatest boxing flick of all time done with a classiness and a lyricism.
