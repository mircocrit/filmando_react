21;The fact that they went on to do comparatively little in the world of film and song makes it all the more amazing.

I:18730;42;With the dramatic scene, the Beautifull movie ends with such happyness and love.
I:18730;43;music : The most important part in this movie is the music!
I:18730;44;These classic songs makes the movie such a beautiful one.
I:18730;45;I just love the music~!
I:18730;46;It makes it even lively~!
I:18730;47;Characters: Maria has a very jumping and tough image with such a soft heart inside which affects the once very loving Von Trapp.

I:18730;54;But I always enjoy watching it when I come across it.
I:18730;55;Robert Wise was no slouch"
56;This movie is such an incredible work of art that I tend to compare it in importance to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony's .
57;Sorry to get political, though: the politics are important because it reminds us of where we are today.
58;This wonderful movie, known by virtually all in America, is an inspirational movie.
59;Julie Andrews brilliantly acts as the star of this classic.
60;Bought this for my wife, as this is her favorite musical of all time.
61;She has yet to watch it (bought probably 2 years ago), and I refuse to because I hate musicals.
62;Great sale price, quick shipping.
63;The Sound of Music is always going to be a classic.
64;"It is a very charming story and well done

I:18730;82;The colors are vibrant and the sound has much improved as well.
I:18730;83;Even our 11 year old son who watched it for the first time enjoyed it.
I:18730;84;One of my favorite movies!
I:18730;85;I loved the disc with all the behind the scene information.
I:18730;86;Very nice gift.,nothing lijke seeing the original movie version"
87;The movie contains inspiring music, a hopeful story line, and an engaging Julie Andrews as Maria, the young governess to the Captain's seven children.
88;interesting supporting subplots also abound.
89;wWII Austrian setting with the threat of Nazi occupation.You will find Maria to be creative, inventive, and made of sterner stuff than she appears to have.
90;There is hesitancy, faith, fun, music, romance, drama and suspence, and even comedy in this time honored Oscar.
91;It's a great show for the entire family .
92;it does not have offensive language, violence, etc., but it does have abundant positive lessons about family and loyalty.5 stars all the way.
93;As much a merry musical as a riveting drama, The Sound of Music remains a classic that remains one of our favorite things.
94;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are solidly terrific in Robert Wise's big.
95;Rodgers and Hammerstein's score (their last as a team) is magical and memorable, the way all great musical scores should be.

I:18730;97;along lyrics"

100;Not many movies like this anymore so I enjoy watching it from time to time.
101;Very good movie to watch with the family.
102;drawback is it's kind of long.
103;The box set that I received is finally something that I can be proud and happy with AMAZON US as this time round, it comes properly SECURED package without any sort of damages to the box set (as compared to the first initial set that weren't properly package for delivery.
104;now for the movie, this Blu ray remastered film is obsolutely gorgeous for a 60's musical flick and the audio was fine and dandy (what do you expect with a 60's musical anyway?!)

106;A must have for anyone that appreciate good family oriented musical.

141;it was a lot of fun to see how they grew up.
142;It was also nice to see Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer together, although I think it would have been fantastic if they could have gotten them together with the children as well.
143;This one is definitely worth the extra money for a second disc.
144;Classic and my ten year old also loves it she was so excited while we were watching it it was awesome
145;Beautiful music, exception voice, palpable and liquid color, and an orgy of conservative values .
146;"I remember seeing this when I was about twelve years old, easily pleased by the story then
I:18730;147;Julie is still winsome, the children are still able to come across as real.
I:18730;148;The Sound of Music was, is, and hopefully always will be a treat for the eyes, and respite for the soul.

177;This is a really well made music box, not some cheap plastic chinese import.
178;This can easily make a good coffee table book.
179;This is a truly exceptional value for 20$.
180;I felt like a kid opening and looking through each item.
181;the sound of music is a classic musical and of course it is a 5 plus show.
182;Loved it even before we got it.

196;I grew up with this movie and the gift set was excellent and a lot nicer than i expected it to be.
197;After my nieces saw The Sound of Music with Carrie Underwood last year (and they loved it!)
198;What can I say my little one loves the music!
199;This movie has been a favorite of mine since the early 90s .
200;So tell me: just when does a nation's FLAG take precedence over the life of your fellow human.
201;the music alone in this wonderful classic .
202;will keep you humming to yourself long after the movie ends .
203;it's a wonderful story of good winning over evil .
204;it'll do you good inside your soul.

208;It has unseen footage that is so interesting and cool.
209;It is one gift that the whole family will enjoy!!
210;I saw the A&E movie on TV and it is really very interesting the real life of Maria VonTrapp
211;One of our family's favorite movies!
212;In fact, all the other film versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein productions (The King and I, South Pacific, Oklahoma!)
213;on the other hand, more modest musical productions have retained their freshness due in large part of their superior musical qualities.
214;Before he teamed up with Hammerstein, Rodgers had forged a partnership with the infinitely more gifted Lorenz Hart.
215;Their score of Showboat , or a potpourri of their compositions featured in Pal Joey illustrate how great music can elevate more modest productions.
216;The cinematography is breathtaking and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer carry off their roles rather well.
217;Robert Wise won the Oscar, but it is still quite a drop off in what he did for West Side Story four years earlier.
218;in all great musicals it is the music that makes the film.
219;I was also able to appreciate more some of the romantic subtleties lost on an 8.
220;To hear Julie Andrews singing at her peak is always divine.
221;It was one of our family traditions to watch it together, and we soon learned the songs by heart.
222;Yes, the songs are great, and this musical as a whole is wonderful!
223;Hopefully they will have some of the same great memories of this film that I have in my heart.
224;This is a perfect addition to your movie collection!
225;No matter how sad I feel, I can watch this movie and remember that God is still around, as evidenced by the naturally beautiful scenery in this movie.
226;so is my heart when I watch this magnificent scenery unfold before me.
227;She makes me laugh whenever she answers so childishly casually but so brutally frankly.
228;She is so kind who could dislike her?I first saw this movie in 1966 when I was ten years old.
229;I was very impressed by everything in the movie then, and I am as impressed now at the age of 50.
230;I guarantee that this movie is still a winner after 40 years!
231;I was in high school and absolutely thrilled to be in the audience with the Governor and Maria von Trapp.
232;Loved the film and especially the assistance of the Nuns!A memory from days long ago and now Maria has passed away at the age of 99.
233;I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a child.

244;Still an exellent story .
245;It's true, you've never seen The Sound of Music like this!
246;the picture, sound, editing, choreography, overall craftsmanship, and cast are so uniformly excellent!
247;Then it brought tears to my eyes just as it does now.
248;aO, a larger format than a standard 35MM, that yields a very high fidelity image and rich color on screen.
249;So you can see the full widescreen composition of this beautifully shot film.
250;i watched this all the time as a kid and this version has awesome color and sound.
251;My sixth grader was learning about this movie and loved it so much she wanted to watch it with the whole family.
252;I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember.
253;Love the movie and sound.
254;I just love this production.
255;It is a great gift to anyone.
256;I believe this is one of the greater masterpiece.
257;I send flowers every few weeks, and last month I also sent her favorite gourmet ice cream topping.
258;Now, as I wrote to my sister who has a doctorate in music and who is also caring for Mom, that I want her family to keep the package when Mom passes.
259;to some more than others, and that love of music has passed on down through the generations.
260;"They connect with my mom, their ""Granny,"" on Skype or FaceTime and play their latest pieces for her when she is able to listen."
261;if you have ever enjoyed this movie .
262;and millions of you have .

269;This is a classic show.
270;I was so happy to find a replacement for my original one.
271;Just as good as the original.
272;It is a shame that Carrie Underwood tried to portray this film which she is not an actress but she certainly is an excellent country singer.
273;This is an excellent movie of a Broadway musical with an excellent cast.
274;I have a very emotional relationship with this movie.
275;I think a lot of folks love this family film and have shared it with their own children and grandchildren since it was released.
276;Sound of Music is a classic.
277;It is based on a true story of a family .
278;The story, music, and dancing will lift your spirits.
279;The locations in are beautiful.
280;ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available.
281;Robert Wise's 1965 film adaptation eliminates three songs but adds two.
282;IMDb incorrectly reports that Portia Nelson appeared both on stage and in the movie.
283;Her pleasant manner and a refusal to maintain unbending discipline soon wins them over.
284;When the captain goes off to visit his baroness girlfriend, Maria uses the opportunity to encourage regular playtime and exploration of beautiful Salzburg.
285;She also teaches her charges how to sing and harmonize.
286;Their lovely harmonies melt Trapp's frozen heart and the visibly moved captain joins their song.
287;at an elegant party hosted by Trapp, Maria realizes she's falling in love with him.
288;She leaves for the convent but Mother Abbess sends her back to the children, who are brokenhearted and have come looking for her.
289;songs in this classic musical are a delight, Austrian scenery more so, its story's always engaging, but best of all is the nuanced Oscar.
290;nominated performance of Miss Andrews (she'd won the previous year forMARY POPPINS).
291;It's a timeless classic for a reason.
292;And the seven charming kids.
293;I'm sure she was a delightful girl just as she was in the movie.
294;She certainly seemed a fine woman.
295;i had to watch it again and tear up again.

339;There are small but significant cuts everywhere in that version.
340;So this is a great thing to have.
341;Also the commentary is very good here.
342;This movie, like all of Rogers and Hammerstein's work is emotional without ever being fake or sentimental.

363;I loved all the bonuses and things I learned.
364;The kids love it and so do I.
365;The movie itself is a classic with beautiful scenery, music and great acting from Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Peggy Wood, who earned an Oscar nomination.
366;The late Eleanor Parker is under appreciated and also deserved an Oscar nomination as the Baroness .
367;Her subtle looks of the attraction between Maria and the Captain adds much to the allure of the story.
368;disc version and thought it would give a deeper appreciation of it.
369;Every time I watch it it fills me with a good feeling of family and warmth.
370;She will really enjoy all of the bonus features, which I didn't even know it had until I looked at it.
371;This movie is truely worth a viewing.
372;We loved experiencing it and singing with our daughter.
373;This movie is in excellent condition.
374;Classic movie that everyone should see.
375;This movie is a classic and should be in everyone's movie collection.
376;The story is interesting, moving andinspiring.
377;why do i have to be over 13 to critique this film?a must see, good music, good story, good acting.
378;the fact that this classic movie played on this old computer is wonderful.
379;i just loved the movie and it was very heartwarming.
380;Full of breathtaking scenery, catchy tunes, delightful romance, and set during the golden age of innocence prior to the darkest chapter in humanity, The Sound Of Music has become one of the 20th century's greatest cinematic treasures.
381;After initial mishaps, Maria succeeds in winning the affections of the children, the hearts of the viewers, and ultimately the love of her employer, the autocratic Captain Von Trapp, (played to dignified indefectibility by Christopher Plummer).
382;released in 1965 to worldwide kudos, this movie was an instant box office success and won multiple Oscars, including the coveted Best Picture award.
383;Now she knows all the words to Do.
384;Very happy with the product.
385;I learned a lot of additional background regarding the family, how the movie was filmed, as well as additional info regarding the selection of the various actors.
386;I love this combo pack!
387;This classic movie is a must have in all movie collections!I love the blu.
388;ray case it comes in as well.
389;Interestingly enough, Julie Andrews, together with Carol Burnett, created a spoof on The Sound of Music in a Carnegie Hall appearance long before she made the film, and she was as spectacular in that performance as she was in The Sound of Music.
390;"However, nothing can really ruin this film
I:18730;391;It turns out that the two did not get along so well, and the love song """"Something Good"""" had to be shot in silhouette to hide the fact that they were definitely not amorous with one another in the slightest, but the two play their parts with flair all the way to the end."""
392;"Eleanor Parker as Baroness von Schrader is a perfect foil to Maria when she shows up for a visit and says, ""My dear, is there anything you can't do?"""
393;Richard Hayden is charming as the amoral entrepreneur Max Detweiler who books the children into the festival and, ultimately, is responsible for enabling the family to escape from the Nazis.
394;the children, of course, get quite a bit of the attention as Maria came to care for them.
395;The score is such an impressive part of the movie, and the choreography with the children is so well staged .
396;that it's important to appreciate the film's many virtues.
397;so much can be said about the film, but one thing I can say that says it all: you'll definitely enjoy it.
398;It's probably the happiest film ever made, and you'll enjoy watching it throughout.
399;If you are the sort of person who likes being happy and likes watching happy films, this is the film for you.
400;Great music, beautiful scenery, and a happy story with a happy ending.
401;Of course, the movie itself is also perfect.
402;The Sound of Music is one of the top five musicals ever filmed.
403;Julie Andrews is one of the finest singers and actors ever to grace this planet.
404;Last week we marveled at her performance in Mary Poppins, and this week we got to watch another excellent performance in this movie.
405;Enjoyed again after all these years!
406;I know this is a sappy movie to some people but I loved it the first time I saw it back in 1966, which is when I also met my husband who happened to be sitting next to me in the theatre.
407;the movie appeals to me for a variety of reasons.
408;First the cinematography is stunning.
409;The musical elements by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein are wonderful and the core of the story is one that when I stop and think about the period (WW2) that it is set in, with a widower newly married with all those children and a pregnant wife, escaping on foot over rugged mountains out of Austria into Switzerland, boggles the mind.
410;Somewhere the movie connects with us, because we see ourselves in one of the characters.
411;My son was very happy that I bought him this as a gift.
412;This movie is a wholesome classic that gives you the opportunity to show younger children a little history that they should be aware of growing up.
413;There are very few movies that I can say this about.
414;The telling tale about whether or not a movie is good is if it is still loved and enjoyed fifty years later!
415;The cinematography is amazing, it truly makes me want to visit Austria and take the Sound of Music Tour!
416;We loved watching this wonderful movie again.
417;Thank you for the quick shipping!
418;Not only is the transfer flawless and the sound and picture stunning, but the second disk contains information about the Von Trapp family and the production itself that help round out what is a wondrous motion picture experience.
419;the family, the production, the crew, and the actors.
420;Once you see it, your life will indeed be filled with the sound of music.
421;One of my favorite musicals.
422;One of the greatest movies ever made.
423;"I've heard about ""The Sound of Music"" most of my life, but I never really took the time to watch it until recently."
424;Even though it's a long movie, almost 3 hours, I found it very entertaining.
425;So what started out as lighthearted and fantastical ended as scary and realistic.
426;"Even though Christopher Plummer is a very handsome man and a fine actor, I found him to be a very dull singer, but other than that ""The Sound of Music"" is a great movie"
427;There are enough extras to keep you busy for days and the film looks and sounds great.
428;I also enjoy being able to switch over to the commentary track to hear director Robert Wise's thoughts, and to hear the music performed without vocals or foley tracks.
429;Such a great film to watch with the family!
430;Gave it to my mom as a gift and she loved it!
431;I particularly love watching it around the holidays.
432;The movie has great stars in it and beautiful music!
433;Julie Andrews is one of my all time favorites!
434;With the breathtaking scenery, the classic songs and dancing, and the classic entertainment without the trash, there is nothing but a win here.
435;Enjoy this movie with the family.
436;"She loved everything in this package
I:18730;437;The Sound of Music is one of my most favorite musicals.
I:18730;438;It is even better on blu.
I:18730;439;Julie Andrews is beautiful and charming.
I:18730;440;Everything from the story line, to the music, and dancing is just magical.
I:18730;441;You know its a great movie when your kids and wife ask you to watch it over and over.
I:18730;442;I just got a blu.
I:18730;443;Grandma and Grandpa enjoy it again and again, even without the """"grands"""" around."""
444;I had my daughters and grand.
445;daughters with me and everyone, even the five year old, was totally entertained.
446;ray, as that is what I bought the package for.
447;The people are so crisp and clear.
448;ray as well, which I will review later) and have watched it at least 3 times a day for the past few days.
449;I know, I know, that's a lot.
450;But I loooooove watching my favorite movies over and over, and he loves me, so he deals with it.
451;this movie is most certainly worth the $24+change that I paid for it.
452;Julie Andrews is worth it.
453;i suspect I shall be watching this gem again and again.
454;It did hit the spot!
455;Our whole family adores this film.
456;The sound is top flight.
457;This is a great classic feel good family movie.
458;I got this for my wife for Christmas and it was great!
459;Thought you loved this in the big screen?
460;Watch this in Blue Ray and the clarity is so good that you can hear crickets as Julie Andrews spins in the meadow.
461;I don't like my daughter watching TV (21 months old), but the music and the scenes in this movie are priceless, and she ends up singing along and dancing along with them.
462;If you love this movie, you must watch it in Blu.
463;I liked the movie as a child, but I watched it again when we bought this, and I was mesmerized and fell in love with it!
464;But since my daughter loves the movie, playing the songs in the car lets her enjoy them .
465;she's entertained instead of just having a .
466;i love the little music box that comes with it.
467;Because we love the movie, having the music box makes it more nostalgic.
468;at an outside store, and I wish I bought 4 more to give as gifts because it's such a wonderful thing to have.
469;But for $35 when I bought it as a present for someone else, it's still very much worth it!
470;It is a beautiful story with great songs.
471;All of the kids enjoyed it from teenager to toddlers.
472;I wanted to give my family an experience that they would enjoy!
473;the story, songs, and scenery make for a wonderful addition to the collection!
474;It is such an uplifting movie and A true story.
475;I bought it in blueray and the sound, color and clarity is wonderful.
476;"ray is outstanding
I:18730;477;The scenery is majestic, the acting is excellent, and the singing is magnificent.
I:18730;478;We've never heard this music with the detail and strength produced by the sound track on this release.
I:18730;479;It really is that much head and shoulders above most other blu ray presentations.
I:18730;480;Everything in the film looks like you could reach out and touch it .
I:18730;481;I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out in '65 when I was a lovestruck, impressionable thirteen year old.
I:18730;482;Yes, the scenery is magnificent, the Bavarian/Austrian architecture superb, the music delightful (though overly sachrine) and seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful dancing across the Alps brings back wonderful memories and youthful fantasies.
I:18730;483;But that's good for about thirty minutes and then what?
I:18730;484;Whatever the case maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is best remembered as a pleasant memory of my youth and leave it at that.
I:18730;485;A great movie if you have young children, or if you're really nostalgic about this genre of film.
I:18730;486;But this tops them all, and I swear it is such a crisp and clean transfer you could almost reach out and touch the green grass one blade at a time.
I:18730;487;Cost and shipping were Great.
I:18730;488;Even though I enjoy action and comedy movies, I really enjoyed the music from this movie.
I:18730;489;i got it on time and im very happy.
I:18730;490;i would recommend amzon, thank ou so much.
I:18730;491;My wife was extremely pleased to receive the 45th Anniversary edition for Christmas.
I:18730;492;Whilst she has opened the box and perused the contents she has yet to view the blue ray discs.
I:18730;493;This is an excellent copy of The Sound Of Music.
I:18730;494;I got this on Amazon for an amazing price!
I:18730;495;The movie is so enjoyable to watch the music is great.
I:18730;496;This movie is classical and wonderful.
I:18730;497;Music is something you can't forger and Julie Andrews' beautyness and great voice could move mountains.
I:18730;498;I ordered it for my 6 year old daughter since she loves musicals.
I:18730;499;She watched it for the first time and loved it!
I:18730;500;Great clarity and great sound.
I:18730;501;Bought this for my wife because it is one of her favorite movies.
I:18730;502;Very happy with the picture.
I:18730;503;The Blu Ray is fantastic!!
I:18730;504;All the extras were well worth it, especially the music box.
I:18730;505;With its unforgettable musical numbers, Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins) shining perfectly in the zenith of her virginal appeal, Christopher Plummer playing an engaging love interest, a fantastically optimistic and engaging Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) screenplay that produced sympathetic character stereotypes (note the Von Trapp children roles), an inspirational rendition of the Rodgers Hammerstein songs, and knowledgeable direction by seasoned film maker Robert Wise (The Haunting, Sand Pebbles).
I:18730;506;However in spite of its obvious shortcomings, the Sound of Music is an overwhelmingly dazzling display of the musical at its most entertaining and inspirational.
I:18730;507;This film is a testament to the Hollywood's gift of providing magically poignant entertainment to masses.
I:18730;508;Yet the Sound of Music remains an awesome remainder that greatness can still come out of the most unlikely of places.
I:18730;509;sidenote: 20th Century Fox's Five Star Collector's edition of the Sound of Music is a bravura achievement in providing a magnificent anamorphic widescreen presentation, a fascinating Robert Wise commentary track coupled with the musical tracks of the classic songs without verbal dialogue, a commemorative documentary, the theatrical trailers, and much much more.
I:18730;510;interesting Facts: The Sound of Music won several Academy Awards in 1965 including: Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Wise), and Best Musical Score.
I:18730;511;The actual movie was all right.
I:18730;512;This is one of the greatest musicals of all time!!
I:18730;513;It was originally filmed in 1965 and every time I see it I'm in awe of the cinematography and a wonderful acting.
I:18730;514;I highly recommend the original and think every child (and adult) should see this movie.
I:18730;515;Ageless great Rogers and Hammerstein music .
I:18730;516;Great to listen to on the road.
I:18730;517;I got this for my girlfriend as a spur of the moment gift because a) it is her favorite movie and b) I couldn't beat Amazon's gold box deal of the day price that easily beats any other site/store I have seen this at.
I:18730;518;This is the greatest family movie of all time.
I:18730;519;Sing along with Julie Andrews and your children.
I:18730;520;A classy classic that puts a smile on my face anytime and every time I hear anything referring to The Sound of Music .
I:18730;521;I enjoy going to the local play productions when they produce it every few years, but when a play often has such force of presence, this movie still holds its own an echelon above all.
I:18730;522;great movie glad to own it in blue ray.
I:18730;523;The film is spectacular in Blu.
I:18730;524;time impressive 40th Anniversary Edition.
I:18730;525;Two keys: """"Ctrl"""" and """"+"""" and you're set."""
526;ray player owners, you bet!
527;Rogers and Hammerstein's music is timeless even if the movie is a bit dated and corny at times.
528;Julie Andrews is truly amazing.
529;This has to be a must see for any movie buff.
530;Julia Andrews is such a large part of my childhood.
531;My mom shared this movie with me when I was a little girl and I still get a smile on my face each and every time I watch it.
532;The music is wonderful and the acting is great.
533;I saw Elizabeth Von Trapp in concert in Omaha and she inherited a beautiful voice and personality.
534;ray feature today on a twelve.
535;The DTS 7.1 soundtrack is also a major improvement over previous editions.
536;Thank you, Fox, for a magnificent achievement in remastering a classic film.
537;"This box set includes some great ""extras""."
538;The hardcover book is very informative, and has many pictures from the making of the film.
539;The set also includes some great picture postcards of the cast in Salzburg, Austria.
540;Finally, the music box was a welcome addition to this box set.
541;I am sure my wife will enjoy it.
542;century Fox, for a job well done!
543;This box set is very complete and interesting to look at.
544;Everything was in good condition except for the music box.
545;But everything else is satisfying
546;I would recommend this to any one that loves music
547;When you think of popular movies, The Sound Of Music is definitely going to be on many people's lists.
548;Infact, it's probably the most famous movie of all time, with more than 1 billion people having seen it.
549;The words of the movie title are so famous, and the whole story of the film is just part of cinema legend.
550;The scenery of the film, along with the classics songs in it have made The Sound Of Music a legendary experience in cinematic history and an icon out of Julie Andrews.
551;the plot of The Sound Of Music is simple and easy to follow.
552;At first she finds it difficult identifying with the children and getting them to open up, but as time goes by they gradually succumb to Maria's charms and her adorable ways.
553;Maria returns to the Abbey with Mother Abbess, who inspires her to return, no matter what the consequences.
554;The final outcome is one of courage, power, love and the restoration of faith.
555;warming tale of family values that appeals to people of all ages.
556;I loved this film the first time I saw it, and my Grandma loves it even more!
557;It's also a rather camp film, which makes it so much more fun in my eyes.
558;the most famous scene in the film is the opening sequence, where we are given a stunning view of the entire country.
559;The camera moving in to Maria on the hill as she spreads her arms and sings The hills are alive, with the sound of music!
560;The mansion is a beautiful place to live with its surrounding lake, and the city is a picturesque landscape that defines the time and culture.
561;it is almost impossible to review The Sound Of Music without mentioning the music that makes it such a classic film.
562;From the first song, The Hills Are Alive, you know this is going to be something spectacular.
563;This lovely new 40th Anniversary 2.
564;disc edition of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a real treat.
565;running 1959 hit Broadway musical that originally starred Mary Martin.
566;The story is as well.
567;Like a breath of fresh mountain air, Maria transforms the children and eventually steals the Captain's heart away from a worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker).
568;"The Robert Wise director commentary (from the ""5 Star"" release) is also included."
569;Julie Andrews hosts this generous.
570;length documentary which features new interviews with key cast and production team members, some rare photos, footage from behind the scenes and more.
571;This is something truly special.
572;This segment reunites all seven von Trapp children to share their own memories and talk about the film.
573;guided tour of Salzburg, taking in the historical sites as well as the locations featured in the film.
574;"This is a cute update on ""Salzburg Sights and Sounds"", which Carr made as a featurette during production of SOM in 1965 (and which can be found on the ""5 Star"" release)."
575;"This takes a look behind the scenes during the 40th Anniversary ""Sing."
576;This is the fantastic `Biography' episode which takes an in.
577;depth look at the real von Trapp clan.
578;Featuring interviews with several of the real von Trapp children.
579;A fascinating look at the girl who might have played Liesl if Charmian Carr was never cast in the role.
580;Great,easy to watch and with a good ending.
581;In the 1960's Julie Andrews played a part in two of the most definitive musicals of the 20th Century.
582;Disney's Mary Poppins and Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, both gave someone a clean cut fun and heart warming experience that had many people humming the songs for decades.
583;She has an amazing singing voice, and a class and grace unmatched by any fellow actress.
584;Maria becomes determined to teach the captain and the children what it's like to have fun, and one time whilst he's away to Vienna she takes her chance to let the children have fun and teach them to sing.
585;This leads to a heart warming story which allows the children to sing and represent their home country of Austria.
586;Watching it again today, unlike most films from my childhood, my opinion of this has not changed one bit, I still love it as much as I remember doing so all them years ago.
587;the music of course is the main focus of the film, it has some of possibly the most catchy and memorable songs that could have you embarrassingly singing along at the top of your voice.
588;The kids are amazing with their music pieces as the general harmony of them is shocking, even considering their age with the youngest being 5.
589;the setting of the film in 1930's Austria actually gives this film a beautiful look, which gives you the understanding just as to why the character of Maria is such a happy person.
590;If I were certainly living in such a beautiful country I have no doubt I would be the same.
591;Because of the beautiful environments if done right it will look even more spectacular on Blu.
592;Sound of Music was one of my favorite movies growing up .
593;The supplemental disc offers documentaries and enough extras to satisfy any Sound of Music junkie.
594;the feature disc offers an audio commentary by director Robert Wise that is quite interesting and informative, but repeats much of the same information included in the documentary.
595;Wise points out where songs that were deleted or moved would have gone as compared to the original stage show, and one can see how such changes made the film adaptation superior.
596;There were also a couple of scenes that were shot but later cut.
597;the French audio track is fun.
598;They did an excellent dubbing job.
599;the 35 minute audio spot by screenwriter Ernest Lehman is extremely interesting, giving you a taste of what went on behind the scenes in the development of the production, from William Wyler's indifference to the film he agreed to direct despite hating the Broadway show, and prospective director Gene Kelly kicking Mr. Lehman out of his house and telling him to shove his screenplay.
600;a still picture of his present.
601;day self would have been a nice touch.
602;For those interested in the location there is even a brief but detailed written history of Salzburg.
603;This is one of those wide screen masterpieces that lose a lot when the original aspect ratio is altered.
604;A must for all film collectors and Sound of Music fanatics alike.
605;There are so many life lessons that can be learned from this great musical such as the meaning of family and how music can bring people closer together.
606;I was more than impressed by Julie Andrew's voice and I thought she was perfect for her role as 'Maria Von Trapp'.
607;I still enjoy Julie Andrew's acting and watch movies that she stars in such as The Princess Diaries 1&2 and Mary Poppins.
608;She has a great voice and is lucky to have played a central role in the most famous movie of all time.
609;After all these years the movie is still a worldwide hit.
610;I am guessing it will still be a classic in the year 2100 or at the dawn of the 22nd century.
611;anyway almost 45 years after the movie was made I definitely recommend everyone to see the movie at least once in their lifetime.
612;"It is the closest that you can come to experiencing ""Heaven on Earth""."
613;I bought this for my young grandchildren ( five and eight year old) and they loved it!
614;They sang the songs and loved the entire movie.
615;This is truly a movie the entire family will love and watch agaib and again!
616;This is a classic that like beautiful Julie Andrews will never get old.
617;this is always a great family movie.
618;He got the part he wanted in the play!
619;It's and beautiful production at a great price!
620;She quickly wins over the children and their father.
621;now that pretty much wraps it up plot wise, yet there is so much more.
622;In most parts they are there for the pleasure of the young and the young at heart.
623;As I heard (I coudn't see the movie of course) the movie and we sang the songs on our journey, I looked back and every face was smiling.
624;This is one of my favorites movies, it's so great and i love it.
625;The songs are very good and the storyline is very nice.
626;This is what i call a real good classic that you must have in home.
627;This is a fantastic package.
628;This is a great collector's item!
629;Bought movie as it is a classic for grand daughters.
630;This is a wonderful two.
631;I only owned this movie on two videos so you can just imagine the excitement I had getting all the extras that went with this!
632;It is so worth owning and the price is wonderful for such a treasure.
633;It gives great background and is most enjoyable to see all the kids in the movie as grown ups and to also hear Julie Andrews speaking with Christopher Plummer.
634;Great savings as compared to big box retailers!
635;I would definitely recommend this as a kid's must have library edition.
636;Item was shipped fast and in excellent condition, I have watched the movie many time and am very very pleased .
637;Thank you for your fast and courteous service.
638;It was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
639;I was very pleased and will order again the next time I need a hard to find gift.
640;The supporting material was interesting and informative.
641;The extra care taken to make allowances for the young child actors were extraordinary.
642;Watched twice since i got it.
643;The preservation is superb, the details are great.
644;Thanks to those who made this possible.
645;Now we can enjoy classic tales in modern video format.
646;A lot of dedication was poured into this box set which was overflowing with items that really a joy when you see it at first after opening the box.
647;"A letter / certificate welcomes you inside the box, a photo album which tells you the history of the movie and a pamplet which was rerinted from the orginal thatwas made 45 years ago, and post crads and a musical box which played the music, ""My favotire things""."
648;I recoomend this for everyone who loves music and movies.
649;This one is worth every penny you payed for.
650;Such a good movie and always puts me in a great mood.
651;I love the songs and even got my husband to watch it
652;The movie is already a great classic.
653;Now you can see every detail clearer than ever before.
654;the movie disc is also wonderful.
655;Still awesome after all these years.
656;Very happy to show it to my girls after they saw the live tv performance!
657;She loves the movie and has watched it several times.
658;This movie is a classic and one of my absolute favorites.
659;"I know it will bring her hours of enjoyment
I:18730;660;If you love Sound of Music, you just love it.
I:18730;661;Although the movie deviates some from the real characters, it is a true story that happened to the Vonn Trapp family in Austria during WWII.
I:18730;662;Love, family, music all brought together by a nun who is sent by the Convent to care for children of a widower.
I:18730;663;Bear in mind, I'm an adult, pretty cynical, and a native New Yorker.
I:18730;664;It's the film that is most remniscent of my childhood, and I couldn't imagine growing up without it.
I:18730;665;It's still my favorite of all time.
I:18730;666;It has always been a classic.
I:18730;667;Julie Andrews is an amazing singer.
I:18730;668;Good movie over all, but not the best acting.
I:18730;669;It is so wonderful to have the music, movie, informative book, and other trinkets to remember such a wonderful movie.
I:18730;670;A classic that is a must for my musical library.
I:18730;671;Great family entertainment that will be cherished for many years.
I:18730;672;This is truly a perfect movie.
I:18730;673;It is a great movie that the whole family can watch.
I:18730;674;This movie is a musical for the most part.
I:18730;675;It's nothing new that The Sound Of Music is one of the greatest musicals ever made and the musical score and lyrics are simply magnificent.
I:18730;676;ray version of this musical.
I:18730;677;For example, at the very beginning of the movie we can actually see and almost feel the mist moving through the mountains and valley, as well as, looking at blades of grass with a totally new experience.
I:18730;678;The beauty of the movie is even more vibrant in Blu.
I:18730;679;Was extremely happy to see this item on Amazon with a special price.
I:18730;680;have , if you are real fans of musical movies.
I:18730;681;Austria is as beautiful today as it was in the movie.
I:18730;682;the rodgers and hammersten score is infectious.
I:18730;683;and the austrian background is cinematically breath taking.
I:18730;684;for what seems like decades after this film was released in 1965, Des Moines Register columnist Donald Kaul had a great time making fun of it.
I:18730;685;But Kaul never had much impact on the popularilty and staying power of Robert Wise's magnificent production.
I:18730;686;The two documentaries also are worthwhile.
I:18730;687;I have not had the time or patience to listen to his entire commentary, but it's fascinating to learn tidbits of how the film was produced.
I:18730;688;I trust she was compensated well above that figure.
I:18730;689;Her screen presence/performance is critical to the film's success and staying power.
I:18730;690;The books are very nice and the music box is a nice added bonus.
I:18730;691;Thanks for making this all.
I:18730;692;For the lovers of The Sound of Music an ideal gift to give.
I:18730;693;The booklet is makes interested reading and the pictures were wonderful to see.
I:18730;694;I have great memories of watching this movie as a littel girl.
I:18730;695;I am excited to share it with my kids and to have it for the future.
I:18730;696;Great movie and great music.
I:18730;697;Even though the movie is over 40 years old it is a classic story that young people can relate to and enjoy.
I:18730;698;The music, Julie Andrews, and the children is a delight for all ages.
I:18730;699;Sound of music is definitely one of my favorite movies!
I:18730;700;True as the song (one of my favorite things) this truly a personal favorite of mine.
I:18730;701;This is simply the best, to me.
I:18730;702;It is the best musical ever made.
I:18730;703;I'm an Animist, and the songs of this play sing to my soul quite naturally and strongly.
I:18730;704;Ethically, this isn't just munch"
705;This is one of the best stories I know of.
706;What matters totally is what this has to say, as far as the Sacredness of the Earth, and the ability to do the right thing, even if your life becomes in peril.
707;This film is one of the most important films ever created, if it is viewed as a statement about doing the right things, and the Sacredness of the Beautiful Earth.
708;I rate a movie as I see it.
709;i recommend it to all ages.
710;a story with uplifting elements to it that was based on a true story.
711;this is one of the two musicals i recommend and wow with 1300 reviews that has got to be the thing on here that i have reviewed with the most reviews!
712;which means basically ,means somebody else had to say it was worth watching!
713;he brings joy to his version too.)
714;the other one i recommend it the king and i and it is also endearing and uplifting and interestingly based on a true story too.
715;So please know that you are loved and race with joy with an untroubled heart in perfect peace and both have and give these and total worth, kindness and gentleness to all who will receive them.
716;One of my favorite movies with an thoroughly enjoyable soundtrack and powerful imagery and story which really captivated me.
717;Found it incredibly enjoyable and it can never be remade.
718;This is a classic movie.
719;This movie is a classic that brings happiness every time out family watches .
720;Delightful, now and all through the year it is worth watching again and again.
721;The acting, music and cast are wonderful
722;It has extras which were very interesting to watch.
723;Love this Movie, One of the Greatest Musicals of all time!
724;I would recommend it to anyone as a must see.
725;I agree with everyone else that this movie should always be available, especially at Christmas time!
726;My niece's favorite movie is Mary Poppins.
727;She watches it all the time.
728;This is a wonderful classic with beautiful music, great for the whole family.
729;This is the ultimate family movie!
730;Excellent music, beautiful cinematography and easy story.
731;line that children of all ages can follow.
732;We love it so much that we have the soundtrack now for the car.
733;and how fun for our young family to be able to sing along as we go about our own adventures!
734;A must have for all Sound of Music fans!
735;A wonderful remake of the famous movie and bonus disc with a delightful insight to the making of the movie, the people, characters, location, etc. that made this movie a classic!
736;This is Truly well worth the money, not only for die hard SOM fans but those who truly appreciate Austrian History, culture, music and song.
737;the movie was delivered quickly and was in perfect condition.
738;The best picture and sound and awesome extras.
739;It was a gift for my grandmother she loves the musical and has for years we will pass it down generation to generation
740;But once the scenes move to the amazing expanses of the Austrian countryside I was blown away.
741;Even sparkles on the water were vivid.
742;Plus, the sound is amazing as well.
743;ray with some features (including a sing along version!)
744;It is a stoneware style, so that is nice.
745;the two books are the great additions to the set.
746;You can remove the sleeve (which has a couple of small pictures showing the contents) and the inner box is clean and looks like the picture.
747;all in all a great set for fans of the film.
748;For under $20 it is one of the best finds I stumbled across this holiday season.
749;Even at $30 it is worthy.
750;I recommend the boxed set for fans or as a gift, but the other version is great for those who just want to enjoy the film.
751;one of the truly remarkable films on Blu.
752;Simply marvelous, epic, and breathtaking.
753;ray disks play perfectly with a beautiful picture on this unit.
754;Still one of my favorite movies.
755;I love this movie it reminds me of my childhood.
756;The children and I were very excited to finally receive this in the mail.
757;ray movie sold as new at full price.
758;I gave it as a gift to my Grandfather.
759;The extra disc was glorious, and he and Grandmother loved it.
760;This is a lovely keepsake.
761;It is absolutely phenomenal how Blu Ray can bring an old movie to new heights.
762;This is one of my favorite movies.
763;I have seen it several times and still enjoy it.
764;I think I enjoy it more every time I watch it, if that is possible.
765;Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews, and Eleanor Parker (as well as all the actors and actresses who make up the children) are phenomenal in this movie.
766;Bought it as a gift, wife said she really enjoyed it.
767;"OK, you might gag if you're in the mood for something like Transformers (which I also love) but anyone with an appreciation for classic cinematography and acting will recognize why it's an ""Amazon."
768;The casting, directing, choreography, editing, even the costumes and sets, are superb.
769;taking and the chemistry between the cast members is as captivating as the music.
770;I caught part of it one weekend on TV and was reminded of how much they liked it when the movie when first came out and how we always had the soundtrack on an a vinyl LP in the house growing up.
771;The Bonus features are not as polished as contemporary ones, such as LOTR or Pirates that are filmed with that intent as the movie is being made, but still interesting enough to and add depth to the story and appreciation for the beautiful Austrian setting.
772;All in all, a wonderfully classic film.
773;ray for this exceptional film.
774;Better than I had expected.
775;Seeing this timeless classic in all it's glory.
776;Still one of my favorite movies.
777;I love it and so glad I own it and can watch it at the click of a button!!
778;"This is a great production with a lot of amenities involving ""behind the scenes"" with the production of the movie."
779;I got this movie because it has always been one of my all.
780;time favorites, and I know from time to time I will watch it again!
781;Excellent material and beautyfull Giftset.
782;Very Nice soube and image.
783;A lot of informations about the production .
784;It was better than I thought and this edition is very well done.
785;It's certainly worth what I paid.
786;No profanity, no sex and yet such a beautiful undertaking and the children of today love the movie just as much as yesteryears.
787;This is truly a classical family movie.
788;I love Julie Andrews and the whole cast!
789;The music is just wonderful!
790;This is definitely one you will always remember.
791;I love this classic Rogers and Hammerstein musical.
792;I loved it as a kid and now my kids are now loving it as well.
793;Julie Andrews is superb in this.
794;The enthusiasm is catching and if you haven't seen it there is something wrong with your childhood.
795;good film that had us singing the soundtrack for days!
796;Julie Andrews, beautiful scenery, wonderful music, a great story, a great supporting cast, and you have a great movie for all ages.
797;We saw it as kids and now our grandkids are enjoying it.
798;First of, I love the film very much, and I have seen it both in the theatre and on video a million times.
799;The original prints has a very atmospheric, warm and rich color balance.
800;The only good thing about it is a proper widescreen aspect ratio that allows you to enjoy the whole 70MM frame that the film originated, without panning and scanning that they did years back on VHS releases.
801;two of the best songs from the stage version, How Can Love Survive, and No Way To Stop It have been cut .
802;it's nice to see most of the original cast, and director Robert Wise .
803;be] end of the successful Hollywood musical.
804;Still, Edelweiss, not only the last lyric written by Hammerstein, is one of their best songs .
805;a simple but wonderful waltz by Rodgers (his trademark), and a simple but poetic lyric by Hammerstein.
806;The book and pictures that it came with are amazing.
807;I was able to send it one for a friend.
808;My mother insisted I see it as a teenager and I wanted no part of it.
809;As an adult with girls 3 and 6, we are enchanted with this movie and watch it any chance we get.
810;Everytime I watch this film I appreciate it in a new way.
811;The dialog is witty and meaningful.
812;the songs are catchy and the scenery will mesmerize you.
813;It has all the elements and twists in our own lives.
814;This film is poetry in motion.
815;A classic that promised a pretty amazing experience.
816;the same great musical performance I remembered with the typical softening that MPEG2 compression does to movies.
817;I've seen a lot of great Blu.
818;ray discs, but the Sound Of Music tops them all!
819;The colors are vivid and the alps are grand.
820;What a fantastic improvement to an already classic movie.
821;one of my favorites, I watch it over and over and have it playing in the background simply to listen to it.
822;Else however knows that Georg is in love with Maria, and when confronted with this news Maria leaves for the abbey.
823;it is a very good movie with great songs that stay with you for a long time!
824;For some reason, it took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998.
825;and I could see why this is such a beloved film.
826;the film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s .
827;she's a joy to watch.
828;The kids are all nice, attractive and well.
829;the film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.
830;Overall, a film which lives up to its lofty reputation.
831;star editition of the Sound of Music, you have a pretty good idea of the plot.
832;the performances, from the unknown (at the time) child actors to the veterans Christopher Plummer (as the patriarch) and Eleanor Parker, are consistently great.
833;Most interesting is the discussion from Lehman (the screenwriter) on the search for a director.
834;of feature that is very interesting, but could have been improved with more information on the real von Trapps, as opposed to focussing mainly on the making of the film.
835;Interviews with a number of the principles, from Andrews, Wise, and Plummer, through the costume designer and a few of the actors portraying the children make it a well.
836;rounded and informative set of extras.
837;In a very nice touch, the length of all the extras is displayed on the menu, so you can arrange your viewing schedule easily.
838;The movie itself is one of my all.
839;It was a wildly loved by millions.
840;Children then and children now take to it and love watching it again and again.
841;The songs are wonderful, instantly memorable, and people love to sing them.
842;"At the time of its release it became the biggest box office winner of all time and even passed ""Gone With the Wind""."
843;so, what is it about this delightful and beautifully done musical that upsets so many people (even as it brings joy to many many more)?
844;My own view is that there was a change in what a portion of the culture wanted in their art.
845;The commentary by Richard Wise, the director, is very interesting and informative.
846;He tells us about the actors, the shooting of the film, the way the actors got along, and he even presents the songs in the film as just orchestra.
847;It is very interesting to hear what is actually going on underneath the voices.
848;I saw this movie at my music class and i love it there are so many great songs that are very well heard includeing,''sound of music,you are 16 going on 17, climb every mountain,my favrite things.
849;ms. Andrews portrayal is superb.
850;this movie shines because of her.
851;mr. Plummer's portrayal grows on you as you get older.
852;My daughter (7) loves this movie.
853;Jewelry box was a very nice touch.
854;Will be purchasing another for a gift to have on hand.
855;Can't beat the price for items received!!
856;Julie Andrews, The Captain and the children will keep you entertained during the entire movie and leave you wanting more.
857;This is truly a classic, and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are just wonderful.
858;see for everyone who enjoys musicals.
859;Great price for such a greenest box set.
860;The Sound of Music is definitely a movie worth the cost of Blu.
861;I've always loved this film.
862;I remember watching it at Christmas time every year since I was a little kid.
863;Watch this and you'll be humming certain songs for days.
864;The casting here is spot.
865;Christopher Plummer is great as Captain VonTrapp, the aristocratic ex.
866;navy captain, who rediscovers the importance of music and love in life.
867;Each of them does just the right job with their roles, and of course they sing beautifully.
868;The cinematography is beautiful here, as the background setting of Austria is so vividly captured on film.
869;I've reviewed many classic films, and I've enjoyed them all, but this one has a special place in my heart.
870;Get this for your collection, it's truly worth it.
871;Definitely can't go wrong for someone that loves the sound of music!
872;I think the German version is the best honestly.
873;Although, Julie Andrews is amazing in this movie.
874;i spoke with customer service and the rep said that the same thing happens to her disc.
875;so beware and good luck.
876;a great value with lots of extras that my wife can enjoy for a long timea!
877;she likes it a lota!
878;After 30 years, the hills are still alive with the Sound of Music and this movie is as popular as ever.
879;I am not a big fan of musicals, but i know a classic movie when i see one and this is it.
880;A soundtrack is even included!
881;A wonderful color, hardbound book about the movie and postcards from Salzburg are beautiful.
882;It was such a surprise, I love it!
883;Anyone who the loves the film will be delighted to own this.
884;The musical is beautifully restored, and the extras are such wonderfully crafted treats.
885;Much care and thought went into this package, and it shows!The music and story are timeless, and are brilliant on Blu ray.
886;Everything you could possible want to know about the music, the actors, the making of the movie, the background story, and the movie musical itself is included here.
887;I highly recommend this as the most comprehensive The Sound of Music package!
888;the music and acting is marvelous.
889;The Sound of Music is a perennial classic if not a masterpiece in cinematography!
890;Forgot how great a movie it is.
891;My daughter is an early fan of musicals and this is a good addition
892;This is one of my favorite things:) lovely collectors edition.
893;The box is a great keepsake to have for many years.
894;it is one of my favorites that used to play every christmas.
895;Very nice collector's item, a wave of nostalgia sweeps me every time I watch this as I first saw this when I was 8 in the late 70s.
896;It is very good movie.
897;I will keep the movie for my pleasure.
898;The effect it has had on me, my life, and my dreams is something that cannot be measured!
899;I bet I have seen this movie at least 30 times (no lie) and I have loved it as though I am seeing it for the first time all over again!
900;"Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful, and who cannot get choked up when Christopher Plummer sings ""Adel Weiss""?"
901;The music overall is touching and well.
902;Climb Every Mountain is a message that holds true for dreamers of all ages.
903;I never tire of it and also of knowing that the story is based on a true story.
904;The scenery is visually stunning.
905;I have a friend that needs this movie, too.
906;Even my two year old daughter loves it.
907;This movie is inspirational and beautifully produced.
908;It has made a profound and positive impact on my life and the lives of my children and grandchildren.
909;My father loved to listen to this movie, my father listened to this every day till his passing many thanks
910;"This is a great boxed set with allot of cool extras celebrating a wonderful musical
I:18730;911;i got it when it was the deal of the day so I got a great price on it too.
I:18730;912;This is one of my wife's favorites!
I:18730;913;Great sound and the picture is amazing.
I:18730;914;ray is the way to go!
I:18730;915;Beyond the music being of a classic nature.
I:18730;916;The theme in this movie is an example of how people of all ages should and shouldn't be treated.
I:18730;917;One of the all time great movies that was ever made was the 1965 musical, """"The Sound of Music."""""""
918;It certainly is one of my favorite films, but it is also one of the best examples of how history gets hacked to pieces to make it more commercial.
919;The basic saying in Hollywood is that when you have to make a choice between the facts and the legend, always choose the legend.
920;This is legend, the kind of stuff Hollywood likes to show.
921;what Hollywood likes to stay away from.
922;"maybe better described as a ""young girl."""
923;Their love was central to the story, and who wants to make a sequal where the man dies about 7.8 years after they were married.
924;The Captain was warm and loving, while Maria was dominating and pushy.
925;I caught this beautiful product on a HUGE SALE Amazon was having.
926;So first, thank you, Amazon for the sale.
927;Second, my mom is a huge fan of this movie and I gave it to her for Christmas and she was so happy.
928;The contents in the box are perfect for any big fan of the movie.
929;I have watched this movie, since I was a child, I love it and watch it at least twice a year, the streaming was perfect!
930;This film accomplished a rare feat when it was released in 1965, one duplicated by only two other movies.
931;It garnered the biggest box office gross in the history of movies at its time, and it took home the Oscar for Best Picture.
932;but the songs are absolutely wonderful.
933;The characters are colorful and well.
934;And the background of the Austrian mountains is breathtaking.
935;The film looks beautiful and sounds beautiful.
936;And you can watch it with your kids.
937;old even enjoyed watching the musical numbers.
938;I bought these as a gift for my mom and aunt for christmas and as far as I know they liked it especially the added accessories.
939;I tried watching it with the kids and all of us loved the movie and the songs.
940;Even my 2 year old daughter loved it.
941;I'm not just saying this because I love to sing and all that kind of stuff, but I love the story, the energy that the actors put forth, especially Julie Andrews.
942;My favorite parts of the movie include the great songs by the great composers.
943;If you already like musicals, you should definitely see The Sound of Music and you'll fall in love with it!
944;The kids made me laugh with this slick wit, well what they thought was slick.
945;Anyway, the whole movie is great.
946;If you ever get a chance to see the play, do that, too!
947;It shows how it is important to have fun in life as well as to work hard, and to never give up what you believe is right.
948;One of the best musicals and a great deal.
949;This is a great set.
950;Julie Andrews IS C'Tres Manifique in this excellent family movie.
951;Heartwarming beautifull score by Rodgers Hammerstien.
952;This is another great family feature you DO NOT want to miss.
953;I recommend this movie to ALL My Friends.
954;Humor, music, good story line and it's based on a true story.
955;I love the additional information that came with the anniversary addition.
956;"The 1965 movie's incredible box office success inspired Fox and other studios to make big budget family themed musicals, most of which flopped miserably with audiences (just remember ""Doctor Dolittle"" with Rex Harrison, and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", to name a few)."
957;"The Sound of Music was Hollywood's last gasp at successful family themed musicals, before the genre was recreated with the grittier and more adult ""Cabaret"" in the 1970's."
958;"nevertheless, ""Music"" was an enormous success, and is a marked improvement over it's Broadway source."
959;Director Robert Wise opened up the operetta.
960;going over some reviews and comments from the sixties, you can find people who have seen the movie hundreds of times and their conclusion is that it's because it really helps their psyche in a similar way that a therapy would.
961;But obviously, they keep on watching over and over because there is a positive essence that affects them in a nurturing way.
962;The movie brings into spotlight purity and happiness as something totally possible and independent of personal circumstances.
963;Maybe that is why Julie's performance in the movie is timeless and fresh: so sincere and real, she really *wanted* to be Maria.
964;as a big fan of the movie, I've found myself seriously reflecting upon one question.
965;Does it deserve the place it has in my heart as the best movie ever?
966;Yes, Citizen Kane is perfect and genius from a technical point of view.
967;Cinematography and photography are flawless.
968;As Ebert said in his comments to the movie, the appeal of the story is to the interest of people in gossiping and intruding in the lives of the famous.
969;So the heart of the best movie of all times is this?
970;Maybe I take it too seriously, but truth is I really love arts and I think they should be taken seriously cause they are some of the few things that will survive long after we all are gone.
971;It's the movie that contains the most perfect balance of beauty I have ever found in any other film.
972;The lovely and simple score with it's unforgettable songs is just natural because so much energy and youth as it is transmitted by the movie cannot be contained and bursts out naturally.
973;The scenery of Austria gives the beauty a character and truthfulness.
974;It's like a master painting that transmits and communicates directly even with the less sophisticated of the spectators and manage to make a direct bridge with their heart.
975;the script is what keeps it all together, while it's not complex it is not superficial, it has humor, irony, and fast paced wit.
976;it all put together seamlessly makes up for, what for me personally, is the greatest movie of all time.
977;If indeed in one thousand years nothing is left of humankind, maybe The Sound of Music would by itself be a testimony of what is the best of the human spirit.
978;That is love, beauty and art.
979;I'd rate it at six or seven stars if I could.
980;the cinematography in this movie was incredible.
981;Combined with the amazing restoration, it was like a movie I had never seen before.
982;Of course this is one of the best movies of all time.
983;This is a musical that makes sense, 'cause music is so much a part of the story.
984;It was really interesting hearing about making the movie and about the actual Von Trappe family, which the movie is based on.
985;"This musical is a total joy to watch
I:18730;986;This particular version is well planned and presented and seems to nicely capture the special nature of the 45th Anniversary of this fine work.
I:18730;987;it will need a special place on your shelf as it is not intended to simply fit in with all of your other discs"
988;ray disc that make it truly a collectors choice.
989;"ray disc itself is excellent
I:18730;990;In addition to the feature film there is a second Blu.
I:18730;991;ray disc devoted to additional special features.
I:18730;992;there is a protective sleeve which shows the box to be part of a Limited Edition and gives the number assigned to your particular set.
I:18730;993;It has many photographs of the real family and tells the actual story of their lives and adventures.
I:18730;994;the second section of the book is called """"The origins of The Sound of Music"""" and describes the steps that eventually led to the movie version."""
995;It is filled with interesting insights about the people and the process that made it all possible.
996;"section 3 of the book is called ""Salzburg: The City of Music"" and along with some lovely pictures gives more information about the city, its history, and the locations where the movie was shot."
997;"All told, the book is a treasure and a worthy addition to the set
I:18730;998;the bottom line on all of this is one has here a remarkable collector's item for any who appreciates this memorable musical"
999;surprised my wife with this one.
1000;It was one of her favorite movies growing up.
1001;She was thrilled to get it
1002;Mini Review of one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.
1003;What was especially startling about that admission was she had seen it performed on the London stage in the early 1990's.
1004;i believe my wife's mistake is ultimately a tribute to one of the movie's enduring qualities: It takes a stage musical and doesn't make it look staged.
1005;The pictorial majesty of the Austrian Alps that opens the film certainly lends itself to that effect.
1006;the Sound of music is excellent family entertainment.
1007;It has romance, comedy, and International intrigue, lavish musical numbers, cute kids and excellent chemistry between the two leads.
1008;Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews give the finest performances of their careers and play off each other extremely well.
1009;The part the children play in the movie is well balanced.
1010;the Sound of Music also has done an excellent job of hiding its age.
1011;for these reasons and many more, The Sound of Music continues to be one of my favorite things to watch.
1012;and wow what things have been done since then.
1013;This was a great remake for a Blu.
1014;and getting the music box was a neat gift, along with the Von Trapp family history.
1015;Other than that, it is a great movie.
1016;This is a classic story.
1017;I think it was genuine.
1018;You can still see the nunnery, from a distance of course.
1019;The story itself is well known.
1020;The Nazi sequence is a bit scary for young children, but the story touches hearts.
1021;"when I first saw this movie in 1965, when I was 9 years old, I pretty much said ""Ugh!"
1022;fast foreword to 2013:This has truly become one of my favorite things.
1023;It's a great way to clear clogged tear ducts as well.
1024;but it's oh, so beautiful.
1025;First off, I finally have figured out the appeal of Julie Andrews.
1026;First off, she is a fabulous singer, and actor.
1027;Her variety of performance between this and Mary Poppins in wonderfully broad in a subtle way.
1028;But let me talk for a moment about her work in Do Re Mi.
1029;But especially amazing is the last section where she is running with the seven kids in a tunnel of vines.
1030;Once the romance and politics is added it just gets fuzzy and focusless.
1031;But there is enough in the first section to really make this worthwhile.
1032;But see it just for watching Julie Run
1033;Excellent photography, outstanding screen play, perfect locations, a powerful story well told with authenticity and heart.
1034;"It's hard to find fault with this movie
I:18730;1035;We all know that Hollywood takes liberties with the truth, sometimes to make a movie more interesting than what the truth might be.
I:18730;1036;A couple of notable examples"
1037;And following up with how they succeeded in America and what they did would be a wonderful sequel.
1038;My wife loves the movie and can watch it anytime.
1039;A classic love story based on true events.
1040;We watch it over and over, and the extras, besides the movie itself, are so great.
1041;i would recommend this to everyone.
1042;I just don't think you can get a better feel good movie and something everyone can watch together loved it
1043;It is so nice to be able to go back to those good feelings experienced during childhood.
1044;With a new perspective and appreciation for these movie I found myself singing along through the movie and caught myself smiling more than once.
1045;It is a great musical and motion picture based on the true life events of the Von Trapp family at the beginning of World War II and their escape from the Nazi occupation of Austria.
1046;It has a pictorial book and personal information about the family and the movie.
1047;The color balance is superb, the images clear and detailed.
1048;The sound is fine with reasonable channel separation.
1049;This is the definitive version of this great movie and an example of what Blu ray can, but often doesn't, do.
1050;This is one of the best movies ever.
1051;The picture is as good as I've seen it.
1052;Sound was excellent as well.
1053;Casting and direction are great as are the actors.
1054;ray (and the case) arrived in perfect condition.
1055;the story, as most readers will know, is based upon a true story.
1056;In fact the grand kids of this famous family still sing and are coming to Indianapolis in mid December.
1057;I highly recommend that everyone do some research and find out about the true story.
1058;i highly recommend this Blu.
1059;ray edition to all ages.
1060;It's truly a national treasure and should be vewed at least once by all.
1061;Viewing this movie is an uplifting experience and is highly recommended for the entire family.
1062;Doing this I was able to access the interactive menu OK.
1063;if you are into classic's, musicals, or really good all time movies this one is the right one!!
1064;this was the first movie i ever watched and i've always loved it.
1065;it's so interesting to see how the real Trap family lived and what happened in their life and to hear them talk about it.
1066;and also to see the actors/actresses tell their sides of the story.
1067;i'm not going to write about the movie itself, most everyone has seen it and loved it.
1068;the extras are well worth any price to own.
1069;This collection has so many great items in it.
1070;They now love it as much as I do.
1071;Actually, we're keeping it, but as Christmas approaches, it would make a great gift for someone you love who loves this story.
1072;One of the best ever musical productions!
1073;one of the world's favorite things.
1074;has all the elements of an Academy Award winner: Exquisite scenery, a compelling story, children, religion, romance, characters serving as comic relief,a memorable musical score, and one family's ultimate triumph over evil.
1075;based on the true story of former Naval Captain Georg Von Trapp and his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, the film greets us with a serene and panoramic view of the Austrian landscape on a lovely spring day.
1076;Along with Sisters Margaretta, Sophia, and Bernice,( Anna Lee, Marni Nixon,and Evandne Baker),she ponders her dilemma regarding the renegade novice.
1077;reluctantly, she begins her journey, filled with trepidation.
1078;but the gruff captain( a cooly elegant Christopher Plummer) encounters her at the ballroom's entrance.
1079;the budding romance of the teenagers gives an enchanting moment as the two get caught in the rain.
1080;as the musical education of the Von Trapp children gets underway amid the fabulous urban and rural scenes of Salzburg, their father returns with a couple of very interesting and influential guests, namely, Baroness Ilsa Schroeder(Eleanor Parker), and a chaperoning concert promoter, Max Detweiler(Richard Haydn).
1081;soon the captain and his guests are greeted by the joyous band of Maria and the children as they fall from a boat and into the lake at the edge of the terrace.
1082;the second half of the story finds the family in sunnier circumstances, expressing their love of music (as is typically Austrian) through a colorful puppet show, and by the childrens' urging their father to recite a song he hasn't sung in years, accompanied by Liesl.
1083;The young novice soon has a glad reunion with her charges when ordered to return to the family.
1084;The Baroness concedes defeat, acknowledging her incompatability with Georg's family, clearing the way for a beautiful and stately wedding between the captain and Maria in what are truly the Last Golden Days of the Thirties.
1085;georg is soon ordered to fill a postion in the German Navy, and in an act of true moral courage, this truly noble family leave their beloved Austria behind amid moments of poignancy and solidarity with fellow Austrians, the distress of pursuit by those who would compromise them, and the benediction of the Benedictine nuns(two of whom tip the balance in their favor).
1086;We leave them en route to a new life elsewhere in one of the most triumphant moments in cinematic history.
1087;the film takes liberties with some aspects of the story while remaining true to others.
1088;But in writing this tribute on the 45th anniversary of this film's release, it is considered opinion that the film's message of the triumph of virtue, and the soaring spirit of this enduring classic will continue through the ages.
1089;the best of the best.
1090;julie andrews and christopher plummer are the best.
1091;Awesome oldie and the sing along words just add extra fun.
1092;This will be a gift for a friend.
1093;I just love this movie!
1094;It's so Disney and who cares that it's almost completely inaccurate to the family's real life, lol.
1095;Watch it for laughs, entertainment and to sing along.
1096;Great for the kids and a sweet love story.
1097;It will always be a favorite.
1098;I enjoy it so much and can watch it over and over.
1099;I received this item in a timely manner and was very pleased with it.
1100;It is such a keepsake!
1101;The Sound of Music, the 1965 20th Century Fox musical which would capture the world with its memorable music and it's touching storyline and continues to have thrived through various generations and will continue to thrive for many generations hereafter.
1102;"the film is an adaptation of a popular Broadway play which is based on the memoir ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers"" written by Maria von Trapp."
1103;"the original musical based on the book featured music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (both Rodgers and Hammerstein were known for their music for ""Oklahoma!"""
1104;"the film would become an ultimate success as director Robert Wise (known for ""West Side Story"" and ""The Haunting"") would win five Academy Awards for Best Director, William Reynolds for Best Film Editing, Irwin Kostal for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment, Best Picture and Best Sound."
1105;"This is where ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" literally looks amazing."
1106;with that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary.
1107;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition is vibrant.
1108;"There is so much detail in this latest version of ""The Sound of Music"", it's incredible!"
1109;I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu.
1110;"may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of ""The Sound of Music"" than ever before."
1111;Absolutely breathtaking!Once again, the crew who restored this film.
1112;what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu.
1113;"ray is absolutely fantastic!AUDIO and SUBTITLES:""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS."
1114;Because the film was shot with a 6.
1115;The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done.
1116;"The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing ""Maria"" to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing."
1117;i absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it.
1118;If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home.
1119;Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.
1120;And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

1122;If you select this option for viewing the movie, you have four categories which you can select interaction with the viewer.

1124;A lively commentary by the five individuals.
1125;Although these are separate commentaries recorded in separate times but Julie Andrews definitely gives us a good idea of the sets and various shooting locations.
1126;Also, hearing from Plummer of how he doesn't like to work with children but in this case, he got a long with the children quite well.
1127;"This first special feature is actually an interactive ""backlot tour"" with plenty of in."

1139;"when I got married, I was amazed that my wife knew the lyrics also by heart and by the birth of our son, to help calm him, she would sing ""My Favorite Things""."
1140;"Needless to say, the music of ""The Sound of Music"" has been part of me during my childhood and I have no doubt that with my wife and son, it will continue on to the next generation."
1141;Just the fact that the film looks and sounds better is significant.
1142;Though it was colorful, I have always thought that was how the film was shot.
1143;And the opening scene with Julie Andrews on top of the hill spinning around, I always thought that was a beautiful shot.
1144;the blues of Julie Andrews and Charmian Carr's eyes just captures your attention, the detail of Captain von Trapp's home or the clothing is detail that is much more cleaner and more evident than ever before.
1145;Various documentaries, commentary, various featuretttes, audio interviews and more!

1149;"And for those people who prefer all things digital, on November 2nd will also include a digital release on iTunes of ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" which includes a sing."

1151;ray release is magnificent and the fact that this entire Blu.
1152;"ray release of ""The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition"" just raises the bar of what a studio can accomplish for a classic film."
1153;Great music, great story, musical performances, cinematography and just a wonderful family film.
1154;this is a perfect release in every category and easily deserving of five stars!
1155;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition is highly recommended!
1156;the most inspired shot is the very beginning .
1157;"that shot, along with numerous others, created an intense ""involvement"" that few films can achieve."
1158;i loved the movie, and from what the other reviewers have said, this must be the ideal release.
1159;i always love this movie the singing and the drama of what was happing back then, and strong performence by julie andrews and christoef plummer bring it to the front.
1160;i got to see the live play past summer, incrediable performence by lady who played the mother superior.
1161;Such a classic, and very appropriate for children.
1162;As a kid, for example, you may enjoy the story as one of how the Von Trapp children learn to sing.
1163;Very rarely is one familiar with all the songs from one show, and able to sing them with gusto!
1164;christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews share a genuinely warm fire.
1165;The seven actors who portrayed the Trapp children are all reunited here as well.
1166;"spoken Wise from the previous edition
I:18730;1167;Wise, (who received the Academy Award as """"Best Director"""" for """"WEST SIDE STORY"""" in 1961 and """"MUSIC"""" in 1965) for the most part, keeps the sticky."""
1168;"vICTORIA""Julie Andrews holds ""MUSIC"" together with her enthusiastic, spirited performance as the rebellious, out."
1169;"Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs still sell the show
I:18730;1170;I bought it as a gift and am anxiously waiting for a chance to see it and see if it is in A 1 shape!
I:18730;1171;Was delighted with this movie.
I:18730;1172;The music is wonderful and Julie Andrews shines .
I:18730;1173;A true family movie for all to enjoy
I:18730;1174;mi They loved it and were singing along and for days after!
I:18730;1175;I forgot how many songs are in there that we all know and love and how much of the movie I remembered.
I:18730;1176;I'm so glad I added it to our collection!
I:18730;1177;so we practically know the lines.
I:18730;1178;ray, this is the one.
I:18730;1179;More importantly, technology truly serves the filmmaker's art in this release.
I:18730;1180;I have always loved the Sound of Music and will enjoy this set.
I:18730;1181;in 1965, the Sound of Music won Best Picture.
I:18730;1182;Very well done and entertaining.
I:18730;1183;Would highly recommend this for a gift for the next generation.
I:18730;1184;to see how GREAT movies were then and can be!
I:18730;1185;This will always be a classic.
I:18730;1186;this is a timeless classic i loved as a child and my children love it also i hope my grand children gets as much enjoyment out of it as well
I:18730;1187;it is one of the first to deal with, and overcome racial bias!
I:18730;1188;Love this movie, it was as promised.
I:18730;1189;Will watch over and over again with my children.
I:18730;1190;Everything in the box are well made specially the music box!
I:18730;1191;Of course this movie is by far her best!
I:18730;1192;You will love the story and the wonderful singing by all!
I:18730;1193;Great improvement over the earlier edition of SOM.
I:18730;1194;Thanks for having it still available.
I:18730;1195;I am very happy with it.
I:18730;1196;This musical was absolutely fantastic!
I:18730;1197;Julie Andrews did the best acting job in her career closely conflicting with mary Poppins.
I:18730;1198;As a child, when you watch movies, you tend to pay more attention to the wonderful colors, and more importantly, the things the actors do to make the audience laugh.
I:18730;1199;which is what makes The Sound of Music such a glorious movie experience: the magnificent music and antics of the actors area delight for younger ages, while the moving and emotional true story of a woman who changes her life and the lives of those around her is one of the most empowering stories ever told.
I:18730;1200;It makes smooth transitions from joyous to serious, boasts handsome performances from some very talented actors, and is helmed by a director who knows what the material requires and provides it amply.
I:18730;1201;based on a true story, Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical is given the big.
I:18730;1202;screen treatment, beginning with the infamous opening sequence featuring the singing voice of actress Julie Andrews as she belts out the title song, set against beautiful Austrian vistas and scenic landscapes.
I:18730;1203;burdening antics, but one night, during a powerful thunderstorm, they warm to one another and quickly become friends.
I:18730;1204;Even Captain von Trapp, who is put off by the unorthodox way in which Maria allows the children to frolic, begins to warm to her new way of handling them, as well as warming to her himself.
I:18730;1205;Maria soon must come to terms with her mutual feelings for him, and that, coupled with the Nazi.
I:18730;1206;germany movement in Austria, may put the happy family in jeopardy.
I:18730;1207;let's face it: everyone knows every song from this movie, most of them by heart, all of them at least by name.
I:18730;1208;The title song, The Hills Are Alive, fits the opener quite nicely, and, combined with such upbeat songs as My Favorite Things and Do Re Mi, the movie takes on a lighthearted and cheery feel that will no doubt keep children intrigued and maybe even singing along.
I:18730;1209;the story is also very intriguing, even in its final third act.
I:18730;1210;As with any musical, the songs match the tone, though none so beautifully as this movie.
I:18730;1211;Her chemistry with actor Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain von Trapp, is magical.
I:18730;1212;rounded and stern, softened later by the newfound love in his life.
I:18730;1213;The movie is as majestic as the mountains that surround the characters, and as moving and involving as any motion picture you'll ever see in your lifetime.
I:18730;1214;I love the music and the story but what I loved about this version is the reunion of all of the actors and actress' still around in 2005!
I:18730;1215;they all looked so happy to be with each other again and they made it look like they were the Von Trapp family again!
I:18730;1216;This movie contains all the elements that a well produced and well directed movie should contain.
I:18730;1217;it is a movie for all ages and generations.
I:18730;1218;Great movie for the whole family.
I:18730;1219;A timeless classic for everyone
I:18730;1220;This is one of the most popular films of the 1960's and one of the most beloved movie musicals of all time.
I:18730;1221;The accompanying story was one of the great musical plots, and therefore this well.
I:18730;1222;balanced musical marks somewhat of a shift from musicals which focused less on plot and more on music to those which have a strong plot in addition to strong music.
I:18730;1223;the musical received film treatment in 1965, with Julie Andrews tapped to play the part of Maria.
I:18730;1224;Mr. Georg Van Trapp is played by Christopher Plummer, who performs a delicate rendition of """"Edelweiss,"""" a beautiful ballad about his Austrian homeland, which is in the process of being seized by the Nazis."""
1225;"as dramatic as it is playful, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the essential musicals in Broadway and movie."
1226;The box was well sealed and had all the extras in it and beautifuly presented.
1227;This is an absolute wonderful movie, I bought it for my four year old and she loves it.
1228;She was so into it she never left the room for anything.
1229;I'm glad I introduced her to it.
1230;This has always been one of my very favorite musicals!
1231;As a matter of fact I always wanted to follow in her footsteps!
1232;There, Julie, Christopher and the children talk about their mistakes which did or did not get cut from the final take, hardships they had to deal with or even childhood crushes.
1233;ray, is even better than the original that we saw in 1967.
1234;old film and in that regard is very impressive!
1235;When factoring in the film itself, the best musical of all time, I have to give it 5 stars.
1236;I'm such a huge fan of The Sound of Music and Julie Andrews in particular.
1237;This is a great compilation and the mastering is awesome!
1238;Was very patient to finally see the Sound of Music made into Blu.
1239;Bought it and have since enjoyed the movie.
1240;Robert Wise and company have immortalized one of the best of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals.
1241;The fact that much of it was shot in Salzburg made it even better.
1242;The special features on the second disc are very good.
1243;Love this movie each time I watch it, now my son loves it too!
1244;A family favourite for years and years to come
1245;Classic film with fantastic melodies, gorgeous scenery and universal themes.
1246;love of country, family and music!
1247;Suitable for all ages and fun to watch together while singing and dancing along with the characters.
1248;I saw The Sound of Music a couple of years ago and while I love the music it did not resonate as much as for example Poppins did.
1249;Repeat viewing increased my love for the film and while its not perfect (which film is?)
1250;is so a joy to watch that now is one of my all.
1251;"R&H
I:18730;1252;My personal favorites are """"The Sound of Music"""", """"Maria"""", """"My Favorite Things"""", """"Do."""
1253;I just love the songs and the scenes in which they are played.
1254;Another highlight is the beautiful scenary of the entire film.
1255;From the beginning, your spirit is uplifted with wonderful shots of European mountains, the gorgeous city of Salzburg and more.
1256;Julie Andrews of course is the power that helps the film being as wonderful as it is.
1257;Just like in Mary Poppins, Andrews is perfect for the role and does it in a way that does not feel a stereotype.
1258;add this an array of outstading supporting characters and you have a great film.
1259;Many have blamed the film of being too sugary but I think it perfectly balances all the elements and I think we have to thank that to the actors and director Robert Wise.
1260;the Sound of Music comes to hi.
1261;Fox must be and should be proud of the restoration efforts.
1262;The picture looks incredibly detailed and the colors are so vibrant that you can feel the rich European scenaries.
1263;All classic films should be restored this way because it looks absolutely fantastic.
1264;Likewise, the sound has a lavish new 7.1 DTS.
1265;Dialogue is cristal clear, the score is great and of course the songs are amazing.
1266;"in disc two, the bonus features are divided in ""Musical Stages"", ""A City of Song"", ""Vintage Programs"", ""Rare Treasures"" and ""Publicity""."
1267;The others are carried overs form previous editions but that is great becuase we have a lot of documentaries, trailers, reminiscences and much, much more.
1268;I tell you, you will need a lot of time to dive into all this material but everything is fun, informative and make you appreciate the importance of the film.
1269;without a doubt, this can be easily called THE definitive edition of The Sound of Music.
1270;the Sound of Music is one of the best musicals in the world, and one of the most (if not the most) beloved one.
1271;It's certainly one of my favorite things.
1272;With impressive picture and sound, and a wealth of excellent bonus material, Fox has created a edition that does the film justice.
1273;Ironically, one drawback of the present color.
1274;Black levels however are spot on.
1275;Although the French soundtrack was already present previously, this is the first time I've heard the songs sung in Spanish.
1276;It's heartening to learn that they've all turned out very well indeed.
1277;enthusiastic with the color correction, pumping the colors up beyond what is natural.
1278;released next year on its new Blu.
1279;If you can, it may be wiser to wait for the next incarnation of this beloved classic and hope that Fox finally gets things right.
1280;An amazing treasure of 'favorite things' for any fan of The Sound of Music.
1281;this was the veru best movie and I show it to my Grandkids.
1282;This musical is a family moment.
1283;Great scenery, a little history, sing.
1284;a. long songs, imaginary trips and more this wholesome classic offers much to anyone who sits in front of the TV.
1285;I think that acting was very good and I love the story.
1286;This is always the favorite of our family and my daughter absolutely loves it.
1287;ray version as a gift for her, and she enjoyed this version very much.
1288;This is a genuine American classic movie regarding a musical Austrian family who eventually settled in America.
1289;Theirs is one of the glorious truly happy endings in moviedom.
1290;Add in the glorious and visually dazzling story, with the classical outdoors beauty and romance, intrigue and yes, Nazis, closing in on the good guys.
1291;This truly is a touchstone movie in so many ways and it is not an understatement to say that they not only don't make them like this anymore, but seldom did.
1292;Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all the rest of the cast were really in top form.
1293;A must see for families.
1294;Watch this movie and see if you don't find yourself humming some of the many hit songs from it in the next several days.
1295;Yes, it was based on a true story, and the Von Trapps still own the ski lodge they opened in Vermont.
1296;In all a glorious movie, that happens to be a truly happy true story.
1297;We are extremely happy with the Sound of Music combo pack we received.
1298;will recommend this for all Sound of Music fans.
1299;For me, this film remains as one of the greatest musicals of all time.
1300;It has warm, self deprecating humor, drama, and beautiful, beautiful music.
1301;spinning with youthful exuberance, on a stunningly gorgeous green hill in Austria.
1302;"Then, the beautiful words, ""The hills are alive with the sound of music."""
1303;Though, Mary Martin was wonderful in the staged production, Julie added her own touch of class, mischief and flamboyance to the role, along with that gorgeous, gorgeous soprano voice.
1304;this wonderful, delightful and poignant story of the young Maria, who has too much spirit to stay within the confines of the convent, is sent out into the world to be a governess for a widower and his seven children, remains timeless, irresistable and very entertaining.
1305;Amazing to imagine that it is now forty years old!!!
1306;The young actors and actresses, cast as Baron Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, dance and act wonderfully.
1307;Also, even though I have heard stories that Christopher Plummer refers to this musical as THE SOUND OF MUCOUS, he managed to pull of his role as the gruff Baron, whose heart melts after coming to know the irresistable Maria, with class.
1308;Also, the cinematography is gorgeous.
1309;You feel like you are in the Alps with Maria and the children, and can almost smell the dew in the grass.
1310;Perfect for the family, and essential for every film buff.
1311;This is a awesome movie!
1312;finally had a chance to watch it again this summer!
1313;Julie Andrews does an amazing job in this role.
1314;The music is great, the scenery is inspiring, and you will be singing the songs long after you stop watching the movie.
1315;My family loves this movie~!
1316;Julie Andrews is stunning in this film and we can watch it over and over.
1317;This is a clean copy of an all.
1318;A timeless classic:) I never tire of seeing this true life movie classic.
1319;This is my favorite movie.
1320;The songs are classic and the behind the scenes stories are great to watch.
1321;Take all the good stuff you've heard from previous reviewers and believe it.
1322;I had goosebumps watching the opening of the movie with Julie Andrews on the hill.
1323;The detail and sound are stunning.
1324;The Sound of Music is a must see for anyone.
1325;The Sound of Music is rightly a perpetual favorite among movie fans.
1326;It took home five Academy Awards after its 1965 release, and continues to thrill audiences today with its superb musical performances, its touching story, and its fabulous location shooting in Austria.
1327;disk edition offers a sharp, beautiful digitally remastered presentation, and loads of extras.
1328;the story is familiar to fans.
1329;Through pluck, compassion, and her ability to share her music, she captures the hearts of the children and enables them to re.
1330;capture the heart of their father.
1331;"the extras for this edition are quite remarkable, including the usual ""making of"" features that detail the lengthy backstory of the movie and the musical stage production that preceded it."
1332;Co. stars Jule Andrews (Maria) and Christopher Plummer (Captain Von Trapp) provide delightful commentary.
1333;Perhaps most interesting to this reviewer was the reunion of the actors who played the seven Von Trapp children.
1334;They have some interesting stories about the long production of the movie in California and Austria.
1335;Rehearsals and filming ran for months, during which the two boys grew several inches, two of the younger girls shed teeth, and all contributed to pranks and gaffs on and off set.
1336;The Sound of Music is very highly recommended as superb family entertainment that has stood the test of time and is even better in this refurbished edition.
1337;They grew up in Dresden and diden't have access to American films until they moved to the West in the late 1990's and had told me that they have always wanted to see The Sound of Music since they were familier with the musical score by Rogers and Hammerstein.
1338;I bought this during one of Amazon's one day deals.
1339;I can't say enough about the beautiful transfer of the movie, everything is gorgeous and the sound is amazing.
1340;The movie arrive early and just as stated by the Seller, thank you:) My kids loved this movie so I got it for my Granddaughter who laughs everytime I sing DO RE ME!
1341;The first disc comes with the movie, along with some introductory information from Julie Andrews, and a fun sing.
1342;The second disc provides a fascinating documentary that provides an interesting look into the making of the movie, along with meeting the actual grandkids of the Von Trapp family, and much more!
1343;I love this movie and having it in Blue.
1344;I love the option of keeping the Blue.
1345;I really love this movie.
1346;The clarity was fantastic seeing it on blue ray.
1347;If you love the Sout of Music, you should get this one.
1348;The book and the real story was great to read.
1349;My daughter loves this movie and it's just a great musical classic that everyone should experience.
1350;I recommend this If your into dramatic musicals.
1351;The best movie of all time.
1352;I really like the additional information and features, especially showing the kids grown up
1353;My wife and I watched it with our four kids (ages 13, 11, 9, 6).
1354;I got it for the music (fantastic in our home theater) but the kids were really into the movie!
1355;They were squirming in their seats during the chase scenes.
1356;Wonderful move and the blu ray clarity is amazing!
1357;That despite the fact that it is sappy and a bit obvious, it's also witty, funny, touching, and endearing.
1358;You will want to BE Maria!Maria is a high.
1359;spirited young nun who is always late, always skipping and singing and sprinting around, and she's driving the solemner nuns up the wall.
1360;Maria is shocked by this, and quickly tries to give the kids love and affection and FUN.
1361;There are love stories and stories about runaways, and the Nazis loom over all of it.
1362;the kids are amazing, from energetic teen Liesl to amazingly (but not cloyingly) cute Gretl.
1363;plummer is excellent, he's alternately tender (with hardly a word said) and strict, loving and cold.
1364;But what shines through all the time is Von Trapp's moral sense, and determination not to help the Nazis.
1365;Julie Andrews is bright and effervescent, turning from a grown.
1366;Then, in her last scene, she surprises everyone.
1367;this is a beautiful musical tale with roots in reality, a must.
1368;It's really worth it if you are a fan of this movie!!!
1369;Great movie and great singing and acting by Ms Andrews.
1370;Glad to have him on as his last bit of comments on such a great movie.
1371;But she is still with us and hopefully she will continue to be given movie parts.
1372;The Sound of Music is one of her best performances in a musical and Duet for One is the best of her performances in a serious Drama.
1373;ray disc is an excellent product, with lots of information.
1374;There are several others including portuguese to my happiness.
1375;perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order.
1376;The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning love that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.
1377;A closer examination of the 174.
1378;The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed.
1379;"but no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for ""Do Re Mi"", the unintended slumber party for ""My Favorite Things"", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of ""Edelweiss"", the gauzy gazebo duet ""Something Good"", the puppy love pas."
1380;The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann.
1381;Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.
1382;Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs.
1383;Then there is a very informative, 63.
1384;there are also two charming looking.
1385;minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).
1386;along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers.
1387;"Also included are a fascinating A&E
I:18730;1388;driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler .
I:18730;1389;The movie is a wonderful, entertaining, must have version of the movie with wonderful sound and picture that surpasses all other versions.
I:18730;1390;If you are a true Rodgers and Hammerstein Sound of Music fan than this version is for you.
I:18730;1391;What makes a great film?
I:18730;1392;Casting, direction, cinematograhy, art direction, editing, music.
I:18730;1393;This film has the best of everything.
I:18730;1394;This is a film that can be viewed hundreds of times and be in awe of its masterful elements.
I:18730;1395;The attention to detail is astounding.
I:18730;1396;All the actors including the children are perfectly cast.
I:18730;1397;Every frame of the film is crafted brilliantly.
I:18730;1398;I first saw the Sound of Music as a child, and fell in love with the music, the photography, and Charmain Carr.
I:18730;1399;Over the last 45 years, I have watched this beloved film again and again, never ceasing to be moved by Wise's cinematic masterpiece.
I:18730;1400;On thinking about the """"composition"""" of this movie, I realize it has everything"
1401;stirring music, lovable characters, danger, and romance.
1402;And, ultimately, the triumph of the human spirit.
1403;The last time I viewed this moive was when it first played in the theathers.
1404;I was a good if not better with the blue ray and digital upgrades.
1405;The 40th edition of the Sound of Music is wonderful.
1406;The colors and sound are so real and of course the music is supurb.
1407;extra features included in this edition are so interesting.You will love it.
1408;"This is a great film who's central message is timeless: ""climb every mountain till you find your dream,"" despite social, political or familiar convention or constraints."
1409;So great to see this on blu ray!
1410;Loved this movie as a child and still do.
1411;I gifted this set to my family members, and everyone loved it!
1412;I love the addition of the soundtrack and the book.
1413;This is such a great movie and usually so expensive.
1414;I was psyched to find this at such a good price!
1415;It worked out very well and everyone is happy!
1416;A must see, even if you don't like musicals.
1417;This just might be our, new, family favorite.
1418;This movie is still an inspirational and enjoyable classic.
1419;Also, the Austrian scenery is beautiful.
1420;I recommend this movie to everyone.
1421;We watched it with our boys, ages 11 and 7, and they loved it!
1422;Part historical, part musical, part comedy.
1423;My freshmen loved the movie.
1424;The Sound of Music is a timeless classic that I first saw decades ago, long before I was married.
1425;I have again seen it hundreds of times with the whole family and everybody in the family enjoys it.
1426;It is really lovely to listen to Maria singing.
1427;We all enjoy the beautiful music and love the moving story.
1428;All the actors played their roles superbly.
1429;She was full of life and she often got into trouble.
1430;She discovers that the unruly behaviour of the kids was due to their need for love.
1431;Maria brings love and happiness through song and caring to the von Trapp family.
1432;Maria and the Captain soon discover that they are deeply in love.
1433;this is a highly recommended movie for the whole family for its entertainment and educational value.
1434;Julie Andrews is wonderful in the role.
1435;She can sing AND act.
1436;Good acting is as important as good singing.
1437;The finest family musical ever made!
1438;This collection and edition will be enjoyed by young and old.
1439;So I bought a new one and donated the old one to the local lending library.
1440;i well remember the era when this was produced, when much excellent music, drama, and comedy was available without their being scenes to offend anyone.
1441;All that rescues this farce (besides Eleanor Parker's lines, in which I heartily concur) is Julie Andrews' glorious voice and the stunning scenery of Salzburg.
1442;ray player yet, but I was able to go to a friend's house and see the extras from the film.
1443;Very interesting information about the movie, and about the kids (that have since grown up) that acted in this movie.
1444;"What a beautiful country this was filmed in, I would love to go see the mansion where this took place someday, it's on my ""bucket list"" (and I have a lot of years)."
1445;I did not watch this movie myself but it was given as a gift and she did absolutely love it.
1446;Brilliantly done and they were all there .
1447;am keeping it for a special time.
1448;I loved this movie as a teen.

1452;Great story, wonderful timeless songs that I never get tired of hearing.
1453;The scenery is spectacular and Julie Andrews is wonderful.
1454;absolutely loved the music box and all the extras.
1455;This movie is a one of a kind love story of a nun and a naval officer.
1456;If you want a good romance you can sit down and cry to, this movie or Gone with the Wind are the very best two.
1457;If you want a love story with comedy, mystery, and Nazi's, this is for you.
1458;The special features on the disc are very cool too with fun facts and pictures from the filmmaking process.
1459;What a great investment on a classic film.
1460;Every year for Easter I watch The Sound of Music.
1461;There will never be another movie like this one, I love it!
1462;It came within a reasonable amount of time.
1463;mastered, looks sharp, crisp, and beautiful.
1464;Great product especially good to all the extras that came bundled in this set.
1465;my daughter loves the music box
1466;This set contains one of the best movies ever made and comes with every extra you could ask for.
1467;If you love Sound of Music, you will love this set.
1468;in the beginning when you see a bird's eye view of the scenery it is so crisp and colorful, it made me want to go to Austria.
1469;It was beautifully restored and impressive to watch.
1470;I thoroughly enjoyed the background story of the Von Trapps and the restoration of the film.
1471;i'm not sure what it is about this movie, but children always seem to love it.
1472;The songs are infectious and my daughters run around the house singing songs from this movie for weeks after watcing it.
1473;It was really fun to watch together.
1474;A wonderful gift set for any sound of music fan.
1475;The Sound of Music is a movie I watch at least every other year.
1476;I loved this movie growing up and now my girls 3 and 4 can't get enough of it.

1486;I know that it was in very good shape.
1487;This is such a great movie!
1488;I must have for any family who loves music!
1489;This is one of the classic musicals of the 1960s.
1490;The visuals are so stunning, so perfect, it's as if you're there watching them .
1491;And the music is beautifully rendered .
1492;I'm so impressed with this rendition.
1493;It's amazing they made a film with so much to say in the context of a musical of all things (and with child actors in tow).
1494;After a lifetime of hating the Baroness, this viewing brought me to the realization that, after putting up a really good fight, she bowed out honorably.
1495;So many lessons about what's worth fighting for in this film.
1496;THE SOUND OF MUSIC is by far the greatest musical of all time, and is among the most beloved films ever made.
1497;"This 1965 Best Picture winner is truly a miracle in this sense
I:18730;1498;The acting, the storyline, the gorgeous scenery.
I:18730;1499;disc edition that's in stores these days (and heaven forbid the full.
I:18730;1500;of documentary is one of the very best I've ever seen!
I:18730;1501;It may be 90 minutes, but like the actual movie itself, it's so entertaining that it just speeds right by!
I:18730;1502;This was a Christmas gift for my mother who loves The Sound of Music.
I:18730;1503;When I came across this I knew I had to get it for her.
I:18730;1504;This makes a great gift and keepsake.
I:18730;1505;it played well and looked great for about the first 20 minutes.
I:18730;1506;I have the video version in english language and of course all the songs are shown translated in the subtitles so we can appreciate the great lyrics that remain great in spanish.
I:18730;1507;I had seen this movie years ago and loved it.
I:18730;1508;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:18730;1509;I remember all the beautiful scenes of the Austrian countryside and wondered what Blu.
I:18730;1510;This is precisely the kind of movie blu.

I:18730;1530;The movie seems freshly made.
I:18730;1531;Whats a change of pace, and I thought of this classic.
I:18730;1532;cartoon movie, and it holds their attention.

I:18730;1538;But this is the absolute best .
I:18730;1539;The box set really adds an element of fun to the experience, with the books and the postcards and the music box.

I:18730;1541;So much work was put into remastering this edition of the movie, and it was all well worth it.
I:18730;1542;The final product is so absolutely breathtaking.
I:18730;1543;And it really adds an element of depth when you watch it in surround.
I:18730;1544;have always loved this movie (except for that scene with the Mother Superior .
I:18730;1545;This is our """"rainy day"""" movie and I don't think my kids and I could tire of it if there were 10 rainy days in a row."""
1546;It's great to have a family tradition that we all love and that involves such a great film.
1547;Starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, this musical follows a light.
1548;She returns later on the urging of a nun and Von Trapp then realizes his true love for Maria.
1549;With a little kindly help they are able to make their getaway in the end.
1550;I have to say that this is not one of my favorite films but the soundtrack is one of the most memorable of all time and Andrew's voice is truly beautiful.
1551;Although an older film, it remains a good and timeless and heart.
1552;warming show for the whole family.
1553;time, hands downs, number one favorite musical!
1554;The entire movie is filled with timeless, fun music and is great for kids.
1555;Add this movie to your cart!
1556;Everything about this movie, it's just great.
1557;You sent it to me very fast, and I really appreciate that, thanks guys.
1558;keep the good work throughout this year!!
1559;Great movie to watch with ghe kids and the whole family.
1560;Great classic musical and fun to watch again in high def.
1561;A movie that will always capture the heart of any feeling person.
1562;And the second disc show the love they had for being part of it.
1563;Not only is the plot very compelling and believable but the songs are simply inspired classics and standards that will continue to be sung many many years from now.
1564;"This represents Rodgers and Hammerstein at the top of their creative powers and this together with ""Oklahoma"" represent my favourite musicals of all time."
1565;ray version improves upon the picture, sound and bonus features aspects enough for us to shout about.
1566;This transfer to Blu ray is so beautiful it makes me want to cry!
1567;I'm truly seeing it for the first time!
1568;People responsible for this transfer: Thank you!
1569;You've given me a new movie to enjoy and share for years to come!
1570;This version is simply my favorite thing!!!
1571;Not only is the acting superb behind a seasoned, all .
1572;star cast, behind Julie Andrews and Christpher Plummer, but the singing, choreography, direction, cinematography, and writing are the best of any motion picture made that year, it has a poignant story and message the world should never forget.
1573;goodness, love, and faith will carry one through difficult times.
1574;The film is a classic that will thrill audiences for years to come, and enlighten them as well.
1575;I highly recommend this film.
1576;They did a great job in restoring it though.
1577;the funniest scenes are when the Captain blew his whistle to summon his children and when Maria blew her whistle to ask for Captain's own signal.
1578;The look on his face was priceless.
1579;To me the Laendler scene is more convincing in showing their blooming romance.
1580;the most unforgettable songs are Edelweiss and Do re mi (even my 2yo loves these songs and can sing to them).
1581;overall, I love this movie, especially the handsome Captain, played effectively by Chris Plummer.
1582;Eleanor Parker was convincing in her role as Baroness.
1583;julie Andrews was also effective in playing a cheerful, innocent and outspoken governess with a gifted voice.
1584;Although it was a bit shaky, it sounded sincere and more realistic coming from someone who hadn't sung in years.
1585;I give this movie 5 stars it is very good.
1586;If u are looking for a musical with fun and adventure this is the one.
1587;Grandchildren were learning some of the songs and this music puts it all into perspective.
1588;i'll watch it during the times when I was down and somehow, it'll cheer me up.
1589;should be a blast for my whole family.
1590;gET it if you've got a blu ray player.
1591;The Sound of Music is a wonderful, romantic, family values, jam.
1592;packed musical set in Austria in the late 1930's.
1593;despite some initial opposition from disciplinarian Von Trapp, she injects life and fun into the household.
1594;Plenty of fabulous songs, which will survive forever.
1595;the Sound of Music is a classic, certainly a valuable reminder of innocence, beauty and family values to hold onto in the rather dark days of terrorism and loss of values we seem to have entered.
1596;This was a Christmas Gift for 2 of my 3 kids, they absolutely Loved it, have 4 Grand kids who never saw the movie either and what a beautiful way to share n Blu Ray to top it off and in a Lovely Gift set!
1597;Came packaged well and delivered in a timely fashion!
1598;Bought as a gift for my wife.
1599;She loves it and it is an awesome set.
1600;got my friends hooked on the sound of music video .
1601;A friend of mine liked the movie and I saw this one being sold for a good price so I bought it.
1602;It's so well done, that it's like you're watching the movie in the location it's being shot.
1603;def is as good as it gets.
1604;A small, but new piece added at the beginning with a piano is as lovely as the original songs.
1605;I bought this for my grand children and they love to sing the songs while travelling in the car .
1606;This is JUST the type of musical the entire family can enjoy.
1607;I was really really little when I first saw it, and I have loved it ever since.
1608;It has everything a movie/musical needs : an exciting plot, romance, suspense, danger, humour, sad moments, happy moments, not to mention a splendid Rodgers and Hammersteins score.
1609;It is probably the most memorable musical ever.
1610;Julie Andrews was born to play Maria, and Christopher Plummer did a superb job portraying the self.
1611;righteous Captain Von Trapp, so good.
1612;In any case, THE KING AND I is more touching than THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and I liked the subtle Anna/The King romance better than the the Maria/Captain Von Trapp romance.
1613;The most important message you can learn from this is that God's Will always leads one to joy, content and happiness, no matter how difficult and impossible it may seem as first.
1614;The other reviewers are right.
1615;On a scale from one to ten, this musical deserves ELEVEN stars.
1616;I love everything in here.
1617;it is so interesting to look at and to read.
1618;Having grown up watching this film, it's wonderful to have such information on the second disc.
1619;ray edition is simply the best the film has ever looked on disc.
1620;The detail in the picture is just amazing, it's a whole new experience.
1621;The sound restoration is remarkable, it's deep and rich and full.
1622;This is one of the best Blu.
1623;the Sound of Music has always been a superlative film.
1624;The locations, the music, the script the direction and the acting all came together at just the right time to create this film.
1625;The jewel in the crown is Julie Andrews, one of the greatest musical performances ever.
1626;a magnificent film presented in a breathtaking edition.
1627;Beautifully done, great music, lots of fun, inspiring story.
1628;This has always been one of my favorites.
1629;Even better than I remeber from the 60's.
1630;my granddaughter loved it and is still singing the songs.
1631;Excellent reproduction of the original film, interview with the cast today was the most interesting,
1632;Overall, it is an excellent recording of one of the most outstanding American musical play.
1633;This is one of the greatest performances ever given by Julie Andrews and having it on this Anniversary Combo is perfect for me!
1634;This movie is pretty good for the first half.
1635;I saw this film originally when I was a child, and it brought back many memories to see it again after all these years.
1636;if you like the music I guess you can fast forward through the rest of it.
1637;A 'how to behave' movie for kids before they are smart enough to know better.
1638;What is joyful and uplifting to one generation still brings love and happiness today.
1639;We love the joy that oozes from the screen as Maria works her way into the hearts of the children and steals the admiration of the Captain.
1640;It is s great popcorn movie and fun to sing along activity.
1641;A wonderful love story, and the trials of survival during a difficult time in history.
1642;It's nice to know the family lives in the United states now.
1643;This is a wonderful movie.
1644;I personally feel that this collection is worth every penny.
1645;Additional features are great too.
1646;Bought as a gift for my husband and we have both enjoyed it several times.
1647;It's a great family movie.
1648;Got this for under $20 as a gift and it is awesome.
1649;Great box set, big and looks like it is worth $200!
1650;It was a great family night movie.
1651;Both my 8 year old and 4 year old enjoyed it.
1652;he fell asleep and woke up a couple times but well worth the price for this classic.
1653;My 4 year old neice loves it and knows it word for word, song for song.
1654;I also ordered the soundtrack.
1655;From the music box to the postcards, I''ll treasure this set.
1656;I just think the movie's great.
1657;I also think the film is beautifully shameless in its manipulations: all that gorgeous scenery, the rousing soundtrack, great lyrics, Julie Andrews' voice, children climbing trees, nuns with hearts of gold, Nazi's that aren't quite on the ball, and who are hated by all the Austrians (be sure to put away your history books).
1658;and, oh, the delicious governess issue.
1659;The Von Trapp marriage (a nice one, but sex is kept tightly under wraps .
1660;after all, he's a control freak and she's practically a nun) makes for a great Cathedral scene.
1661;The Von Trapps head for the mountains to a new life (with a brief heart.
1662;They look absolutely great as they tromp through the mountains.
1663;Curtain!And silly as some of it is, I always reach for the tissues.
1664;Live the fantasy (but remember it's a fantasy).
1665;The scenery around Salzburg is breathtaking and if anyone knows the area, it surely makes one homesick for the mountains and meadows and church bells.
1666;What a treat for all it would be
1667;The sound and the picture are outstanding.
1668;This is a great musical even for those who don't like musicals as a rule.
1669;The flawless performances by Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all the children make this a visual delight and heart touching movie especially for those with knowledge of the true story behind the movie.
1670;So much comes to mind when I think of THE SOUND OF MUSIC.
1671;It is jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for.
1672;I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year.
1673;There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw.
1674;For a film that is greatness I suppose.
1675;Happiness is where you find it and make it.
1676;As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film.
1677;You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.
1678;such great talents are associated with this film.
1679;The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre.
1680;That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling.
1681;The entire cast is excellent.
1682;tensions are high between Germany and Austria.
1683;The Van Trap family represents the Austrian culture, naval might, and defiance of their conquerors.
1684;Julie Andrews represents the spirit of independant woman, the virtueous ideals of Mary, the zest for experience and excitement and life, and the moral courage to stand up against evil.
1685;I saluate this great movie and recommend it to all viewers that follow my reviews.
1686;My 6 year old daughter loves this movie.
1687;She sings the songs and copies the dances and just adores the whole thing.
1688;What can be said about one of the greatest movies ever made.
1689;All the extras just make this collection something everyone who enjoyed the movie should own.
1690;The background of the making of the movie and the tidbits of the real family were exceptional.
1691;I introducts my children to this movie.
1692;My daughter was extremely surprised and happy with this gift.
1693;Now my grandson is a great fan.
1694;It is a fabulous family film we all enjoy from time to time.
1695;It is more fun than most of the television fare nowadays.
1696;My grandchildren now know and love this movie from watching it on TV.
1697;Good movie, good story, clean!!!!
1698;It brought back many good memories of me as a child and watching this all the time with the family
1699;This movie brings back so many beautiful memories and the 45th anniversary limited edition is wonderful.
1700;The book of information on the stage musical, movie, actors and the Van Trapp family was very interesting.
1701;My husband and I took our mothers to see this movie just before we were married in 1965, so it brings back some sweet memories.
1702;When the puppet show comes on, they get really excited.
1703;This is my favorite movie of all times.
1704;Everyone should watch it once.
1705;I think all the actors did a great job.
1706;Also the music is wonderful.
1707;I watch this at least once a year.
1708;it was an excellent story, and told very well through dialogue and song.
1709;The postcards and extra stuff in the box set made it really cool
1710;Has been my favorite movie ever since I was a child.
1711;You don't find many films that spend their time with uplifting themes.
1712;It is a timeless treasure.
1713;The hills are alive to the sound of music, as the song goes, and the songs continue to go, with this marvelous film with Julie Andrews.
1714;Based loosely on the Von Trapp family, it encompasses what a truly family film is all about.
1715;Marvelous entertainment and highly recommended.
1716;ray brought back the memories of seeing it on the big screen, and is much clearer than anything ever available before.
1717;The commemorative book is great, and the box is sturdy and very nice looking on the shelf.
1718;Though I didn't see it until it had been out for quite a few years, it is truly a classic.
1719;It almost seems like this wonderful musical will last forever.
1720;There is great music and great themes.
1721;Julie Andrews shone brilliantly in this movie.
1722;One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children start singing for the first time.
1723;It is so emotional and brings tears of joy to my eyes time after time.
1724;I really love this film.
1725;I have a learned a lot from this experience.
1726;I love Julie Andrews' voice in Sound of Music.
1727;Carrie Underwood has a voice, a style, and meaning to many of her songs that has touched me deeply.
1728;This is the definitive movie musical.
1729;as for the movie, this is a fantastic transfer with stunning detail and clarity on the video and exquisite sound.
1730;The characters, the scenes, the sound all come alive while watching the Sound of Music on Blu.
1731;i would recommend the product to others.
1732;My young grandkids are enjoying the special feature of just the songs.
1733;But this is above and beyond the already fantastic movie.
1734;there is a multitude of extra features, fun and interesting to watch.
1735;Was very happy with it.
1736;It is very nice set.
1737;"winner Julie Andrews (""Mary Poppins"", her first movie) and Shakespearean actor Christopher Plummer (""Somewhere In Time"") team up in one of the greatest movie musicals of all time."
1738;The acting in this movie is top.
1739;"The songs are also classic (""Eidelweiss"", ""I Have Confidence In Me"", the touching ""Climb Every Mountain"" and the heart."
1740;Julie Andrews should have won another Oscar for her unique portrayal of Maria and Christopher Plummer for his excellent portrayal of Captain Von Trapp.
1741;This is a movie I would definitely recommend for the entire family.
1742;No matter how many times I watch this movie, I love to sing along with it.
1743;My granddaughters are now singing along with me.

1755;all a nice compilation for the price.
1756;When I was a little girl, I started watching this movie, and it had such a great impact on me.
1757;I hope that the production companies realize that this movie is a classic and to re.
1758;That is another reason why I was so very happy the reception was PERFECT!
1759;A musical that embodies all that made Broadway enchanting.
1760;Wonderful story line, fascinating melodies and lyrics, beautiful scenery, excellent acting .
1761;The sound of Music is a great movie.
1762;It's has lot's of nice extra's.
1763;It is simply the very best musical produced in the 20th century.
1764;A gift from the heavens.
1765;The Sound of Music comes pretty darn close!
1766;This movie combined a very captivating and multi dimensional story .
1767;Indeed , this movie is much more than a simple love story , but it is much more than a sad chapter in the middle of the war .
1768;This film reached and developed its own profile due precisely its kinetic flexibility and brilliant engaging charm , keeping in mind several fundamental factors.
1769;Andrews owned her own charm : radiance , sweetness and beauty in the purest british mood .
1770;the absorbing and magnetic presence of Christopher Plummer , a very gifted actor who actually is giving a towering and recognized performance in Broadway .
1771;the rest of the cast was a goldness triumph .
1772;The admirable direction and the spectacular landscapes were too undeniable elements who added its contribution for this eternal picture .
1773;a film to enjoy over and over again!
1774;Then the box itself, when opened, gives that high.

1779;The music and the scenery are supurb!
1780;All people of all ages need to see this film at least one time.
1781;I have seen it more than 20 times since it came out.
1782;My wife and I received a Blu.
1783;ray player as a Christmas gift last year, and I wanted to find a disc that would highlight its format.
1784;I am very satisfied with the selection.
1785;I would recommend it for anyone's collection.
1786;Watching this film is a great treat about once every year, and even more so in the Blu.
1787;It is one of the best classics of all time.
1788;It is perfect for family enjoyment and for viewing multiple times.
1789;One of the best movies ever made in one of the most impressive box set produced.
1790;The film is bright, colorful, and produced with a great surround sound track.
1791;The extra in the boxed set are well worth the price paid.
1792;"I first saw ""The Sound of Music"" shortly after its release in 1965, directed by Robert Wise based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical."
1793;Probably considered by many to be her best role, Julie Andrews plays Maria whose biggest wish was to become a nun, but was constantly led to the beauty of the mountains and arrives late to the covenant.
1794;that was until Maria arrives and wins the hearts of the children through music as well as winning the heart of Captain Von Trapp himself.
1795;the opening scene is breathtaking, showing the Austrian Alps and the beauty of the landscape until Julie Andrews comes into view where she does that turn and begins to sing the title song.
1796;higly recommended, this film brings a lot of delight to those who watch it with its music and scenery all blended into one.
1797;The Sound of Music remains the best musical of all the musicals I have ever seen.
1798;you will love this movie.
1799;It still holds the magic, and now I can say its a classic for all the family.Yes, now I see details I previously did no see.
1800;The plot is so idillic that you don't feel the nazi presence inspiring fear, the love scenes are a perfect example of puritanism and political correctness.
1801;Yet there is love and there Julie Andrews gives a performance larger than life to captivate all public.
1802;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
1803;The sound is even more vivid.
1804;especially the background is fantastic.
1805;Above all, a classic movie I've loved since I was a child and was glad I was able to watch it again with my little ones and give them the same experience.
1806;I picked this up for $20 from Amazon and have been playing it all around my hometown of Koboko and everyone loves this movie.
1807;the extras (postcards, music box, book) are really a nice addition to this set.
1808;the songs are, of course, glorious peaks of the American Songbook and the emotional icing on the cake.
1809;a tremendous example of sustained musical invention at the highest level in this genre.
1810;ray all is revealed with far greater clarity and fullness of colour than previously.
1811;the technical restoration of this film is a remarkable achievement with finely restored colour and a well restored soundtrack in DTS.
1812;This is an enormous improvement over all previous editions and is a remarkable example of the possibilities of modern restoration processes which have triumphantly overcome the considerable problems of film degradation.
1813;in my opinion this is a totally successful restoration of a perennial favourite and fully deserving of a 5 star rating.
1814;It should give much pleasure to all of those who are wondering if purchasing yet another 'upgrade' is justified.
1815;you will look forward to watching it again .
1816;It is simply timeless .
1817;and it is the story of good verses evil .
1818;you need to share it .
1819;intellectual types, this film is universally loved.
1820;Let's list some of my favorite things about this movie: A breathtaking score by Richard Rodgers, a lush orchestration of the same, sun washed cinematography, wonderful scenery of Austria, vocals by the three octave range Andrews and the children, a fun story line with just enough history to teach us something, an intriguing romance, and not one foul word, stabbing, overblown special effect, sex perversion or bloodstain to spoil it all.
1821;The editing is so good that it is unnoticeable .
1822;Great music, storyline, costumes and humor.
1823;This is an absolutely stunning blu ray.
1824;This movie has never looked so good!
1825;Detail in the picture is astounding, from the mountains and landscapes to the detail in fabric of clothing,it is nothing short of amazing.
1826;Color has been brought to life as never before, and the sound is superb.
1827;Wonderful music, and songs your kids will love and learn.
1828;and, oh yes, an accurate portrayal of the Austrian embrace of the Nazis.
1829;I have always loved this classic movie.
1830;I wanted to share the love of this movie with a whole new generation!
1831;I have just recently received The Sound of Music Special Collectors edition set and I am so incredibly thrilled.
1832;It is a wonderful keepsake to share with my mom(who is 85 and the one who took me to see this at the theater when I was a child) and to also pass down to my children.
1833;This Collector's set is a very gorgeous sentimental keepsake which I will always treasure.
1834;I am so grateful that I have this in my collection, it is on of the most beloved and enduring classic movie musicals ever made and though there are many wonderful musicals this is my all time favorite!
1835;"Always the classic movie: elegant story
I:18730;1836;It's a family favorite, with the bonus footage of the Austrian Alps and lush greenery that add so much to this movie.
I:18730;1837;This version is shown with clarity enhancing this international favorite.
I:18730;1838;The whole family still loves it and now our children are watching it with theirs!
I:18730;1839;You'll be singing, A Few of My Favorite Things with the grands, too!
I:18730;1840;A lot of care was put into this transfer.
I:18730;1841;The price is right, also!
I:18730;1842;Especially for this box set!
I:18730;1843;You could always tell your biker friends that it's the director that you love.
I:18730;1844;This is a wonderful movie.
I:18730;1845;We had it on VHS, but love it on blu.
I:18730;1846;Now my kids can enjoy as much as we do.
I:18730;1847;Great sound and picture for this movie.
I:18730;1848;This is a great item.
I:18730;1849;it is a great item.
I:18730;1850;I would highly recommend the sound of music for its wonderful story and catchy songs!!
I:18730;1851;Great price and very quick delivery of product.
I:18730;1852;This is a very good movie to have for anybody .
I:18730;1853;The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is by far the best musical ever produced.
I:18730;1854;No matter how many times you've seen this 1965 musicalization of the 1959 stage classic, it's still a joy to behold.
I:18730;1855;She's magnificent and ever so professional.
I:18730;1856;But she's a pro from start to finish.
I:18730;1857;Everything she does it fraught with such emotion and conviction, you'd swear she was Maria Von Trapp.
I:18730;1858;It includes the intermission and the Act II opening music.
I:18730;1859;So are segments showing scenes that were cut and up dates on how the kids look today.
I:18730;1860;The film accomplishes its objectives, without compromising its values.
I:18730;1861;It is a happy, altruistic musicalthe product of a happier, altruistic period in Hollywood's history.
I:18730;1862;The original film is so worth a remastering.
I:18730;1863;this is a family classic that is great to show the kids.
I:18730;1864;this movie is one of my favotie movies for the whole family
I:18730;1865;The Sound of Music is the best movie musical.
I:18730;1866;The music is very happy and grand.
I:18730;1867;one of the best songs in this movie, is Maria !!!!!
I:18730;1868;Great that movies like this are still being sold.
I:18730;1869;True family movies are the best.
I:18730;1870;The VonTrapp family and their escape from the Nazi's is wonderful to see.
I:18730;1871;I just bought it for my great.
I:18730;1872;It came in perfect condition .
I:18730;1873;it is one of the best movies of all time and I want to give it as a christmas present.
I:18730;1874;Saw the original on the big screen in 1965 when it opened and loved it then as now.
I:18730;1875;An iconic movie everyone should watch.
I:18730;1876;Was great to watch all the extras and learn about the actual history behind the family.
I:18730;1877;I'll be watching this over and over for sure!
I:18730;1878;Realized that our grandchildren had never seen some of the classics and this is the first to share with them.
I:18730;1879;The sound of music is the best movie I've ever read in my life!
I:18730;1880;It is my favorite movie and I always watch it.
I:18730;1881;Then great things start happening.
I:18730;1882;Watch this movie, and find out what happens.
I:18730;1883;My students love watching this, even the boys!
I:18730;1884;My sister is a big fan of Julie Andrews so this movie is quite a treat for her.
I:18730;1885;A favorite for all times.
I:18730;1886;As a big fan of the movie I waited a bit nervously to see the results of the latest restoration of the Sound of Music.
I:18730;1887;it's truly breathtaking the images, clarity and vividness they were able to restore from not just the picture, but the audio as well.
I:18730;1888;The small details that really come through now let you get fully immersed in this film.
I:18730;1889;This latest edition finally does the justice this classic film deserves.
I:18730;1890;a true The Sound of Music fan would appreciate.
I:18730;1891;It's beautiful, worth every penny!
I:18730;1892;The music is always lively and upbeat, especially for such a sad and tragic time in history.
I:18730;1893;This is such classically good music and acting!
I:18730;1894;Soon they warm up to Maria, though, as does the Captain, and together they change the way the von Trapp household is run.
I:18730;1895;Of course, this has less to do with the music than the fact that the characterizations are full and complete, allowing you to lose yourself in the characters and feel for their plights and passions.
I:18730;1896;The plotting is also quite taut for a film that's almost three hours long, keeping you on the edge of your toes with the character's personal crises as well as with the outward crises that lands in Austria with the Nazis in the latter parts of the film.
I:18730;1897;the acting is very well done, as that's what really gets you invested in the characters.
I:18730;1898;At the time The Sound of Music went into production Julie Andrews was largely unknown as Mary Poppins hadn't been released, but she nails the part of the innocent and free spirited Maria.
I:18730;1899;This also means that some of the musical sequences can come off a bit to extremely cheesy, but even through that the film still feels genuine.
I:18730;1900;It gives an interesting depiction, especially towards the end of what Austrian citizens had to go through after the Nazi invasion.
I:18730;1901;If you like musicals, or want to be transported to a more innocent time I highly recommend this movie.
I:18730;1902;Love this movie and this set was great.
I:18730;1903;Kids love seeing it on the end table and ask to watch it constantly
I:18730;1904;An all time great movie!
I:18730;1905;Good memories, good songs, great cast.
I:18730;1906;A memorable and awesome film.
I:18730;1907;Sound of music is a wonderful classic that is a classic movie for all to enjoy.
I:18730;1908;We enjoyed watching the movie with the family.
I:18730;1909;The best deal thus far from Amazon ***** the sound of music limited edition Blu.
I:18730;1910;her voice is the best i have ever heard any woman come out with, and the acting us oscar worthy.
I:18730;1911;I have viewed both actresses performances and Julie trounced Julie Christies a mile of.
I:18730;1912;Pauline Kael's infamous vitriolic (and very funny) review of it sealed her reputation as one of America's grand culture mavens.
I:18730;1913;But the film is extremely visually inventive, especially in its contrasts of the cramped spaces of the Captain's villa and the beautiful open exteriors of Salzburg and the surrounding Alps.
I:18730;1914;best of all, the film has at its center the amazing Julie Andrews, who makes the best Maria imaginable.
I:18730;1915;She really does make you believe in Maria's kindness and simplicity, and her love of the outdoors.
I:18730;1916;her arms are characteristically spread wide, accepting the entirety of the beautiful world around her.
I:18730;1917;And has anybody who has seen her ever forgotten how she closes Do Re Mi, hitting that perfect fa as she leaps up the steps?
I:18730;1918;This performance alone forever cements Andrews's status as an icon in world cinema.
I:18730;1919;The Sound of Music has always been a wonderful movie for children and adults alike.
I:18730;1920;It makes for a beautiful edition and should become a member of everyone's home library.
I:18730;1921;Item arrived on time and in perfect condition"
1922;My family loves this movie and we have really enjoyed watching it at home in the blu.
1923;Colors are vibrant and beautiful and sound is first.
1924;a star has come outTo tell me it's time to go.
1925;so I pause and I wait and I listen,For one more sound,For one more lovely thingThat the hills might say!I'd recommend the stage version, to appreciate this classical work, rather than thisFilm.
1926;At least I enjoyed the brilliant acting by all the actors.
1927;AllOf them fitted the role perfectly.
1928;This movie would have been the most perfect film ever made in theHistory of cinema.
1929;"I love the ""Doe"" a deer part!"
1930;I first saw the film as a child, and seeing JA do the spinning nun thing on the mountain brought back the wonder of musicals.
1931;all these years on the Sound of Music is just wonderful.
1932;A great selection of material.
1933;This classic can never be replaced.
1934;Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer along with the cast are talented.
1935;The movie and story is timeless and music unforgettable.
1936;And I thought that looked amazing.
1937;But to see this blu.
1938;And it truly makes you feel like it's a new film.
1939;It is a beautiful movie!!
1940;If somebody love old movies, this is one that you should have in your house!!
1941;The video and audio was beautifully restored.
1942;one of the best remastered classics.
1943;The remastered version is almost better than most modern day movies.
1944;you just have to see it to believe it.
1945;the video is vibrant yet still retains that film feel.
1946;the extras are great too.
1947;A classical of a movie love it.
1948;I have no doubt that this movie will look and sound spectacular in blu.
1949;I'm imagining that it will come with lots of extras like the initial Gone With The Wind blu.
1950;I hope that they provide some details soon.
1951;Forget the schnitzel with noodles and wild geese.
1952;Anyone who's ever loved the movie before will love it even more in Blu.
1953;My wife absolutely love this movie lol.
1954;Of course it's great, and you have most likely seen it yourself!
1955;The Sound of Music, as far as I am concerned, is a most perfectly.
1956;written, acted, scored and crafted film of all time.
1957;It is a gem, a jewel, a diadem in the crown of musical cinema.
1958;this wonderful movie, beloved and familiar to so many, comes with a series of extra features that deepen one's appreciation for this excellent film.
1959;The making of TSOM is told through interviews with the film's stars, its director Robert Wise, and others intimate with the film's development.
1960;"It was fun watching these Hollywood pros dance around the evident awfulness of the stage version of the movie
I:18730;1961;and heavenly to realize their perfect placement in the film.
I:18730;1962;rollingly innocent and a neat behind.
I:18730;1963;tSOM is cloyingly sweet and schmaltzy to some, and a deliriously joyful extravaganza to others.
I:18730;1964;the cast is great and one of the best for the family, maybe not for the men.
I:18730;1965;Between Julie Andrews, Chris Plummer, and the children that were cast, this is one of my all.
I:18730;1966;It was refreshing and a lift to the spirit!
I:18730;1967;WONDERFUL This has always been one of my favorite movies but to have it in BLU RAY was just hte most beautiful cenery and color
I:18730;1968;So this story I highly recommend to everybody who like a great story with adventure added.
I:18730;1969;I bought 'The Sound of Music' as a gift.
I:18730;1970;ray restoration is of course, great .
I:18730;1971;ray will forever be a great gift idea for any occasion or a Holiday stocking stuffer.

2017;Whether you like or dislike this movie, that's up to you.

2020;disc2 has everything a true fan would want.
2021;the movie comes in widescreen format.
2022;But I like it as it is offered.
2023;finally, I love the movie.
2024;I've watched it so many times, and I know I'll keep watching it forever.
2025;The music is so wonderful, the children are lovable and the scenery perfect.
2026;Nothing is better thatn finding a fairy story that is true.
2027;The original is the best movie.
2028;I've loved this film since I was a kid, and find any excuse to watch it.
2029;Julie Andrews was great, she has a voice that was just amazing.
2030;i think the best part of the movie is that our kids can learn history.
2031;For this reason alone, this is an important movie for a new generation.
2032;A gift for my husband.
2033;His favorite movie from his past.
2034;The film is on one disk, the second contains documentaries on Salzburg (where it was filmed) and the making of the film with commentaries from most of the creative people.
2035;There are also audio interviews with cast members and lots of other features.
2036;everyone must know about the film and what a wonderful family entertainment it is.
2037;A bit corny and sentimental, yes, but there is good reason it was the Oscar winner for best picture.
2038;(It is a bit of a shock to see two of the children during their interviews as adults today.)
2039;The clarity of the picture, the sound, everything is wonderful in this package.
2040;even if you have a previous video tape of Sound of Music, this is the one to have now.

2043;especially, the fabulous post cards and music box.
2044;hour making of documentary, theatrical trailers, great stuff.
2045;The 70mm aerial shots are breathtaking.
2046;Now I stay focused on the words of Edelweiss.
2047;It's actually quite a moving tribute to a nation under seige and it brought a tear to my eye.
2048;Picture so close to the original it may bring a tear to your eye, sound so close to the original it may rekindle your childhood love for the music.

2052;There is a romantic story but even if you don't believe in romance, you will enjoy the movie.
2053;My GF loves the movie so I surprised her with this for Christmas.
2054;Movie arrived in perfect condition and it is one of my favorite movies of all time so I'm super excited that my 3yr old loves it!
2055;What better example of the glories of Western civilization than the beautiful melodies of Rodgers and Hammerstein set amidst the Austrian Alps during the mid twentieth century.
2056;The title song is an example indicative of the unique contribution of the West in world history as the force behind the most melodic expression of music written in the major key.
2057;There are obvious parallels that one can see today as we see the rise of fundamentalist Islam and the spread of its influence across the face of Europe.
2058;Perhaps the rarity of great musicals such as this one in our time is symptomatic of the decline of the West as we've known it.
2059;I have always loved this musical.
2060;There is so much history in it.
2061;My 5 year old daughter watched the entire thing and loved every minute.
2062;I'm so glad to have been able to share this musical with her.
2063;Will forever remain a classic.
2064;First time for my husband to watch!
2065;I wonderful old classic very kid friendly for 6 yr and up.
2066;Must see this movie and show each generation
2067;I watched the movie last year and i thought it was pretty good.
2068;spirited young novice nun who was sent to be governess for the seven unmanageable children of a widowed captain.
2069;There, she caught the hearts of the children, and unknowingly, the heart of their father too.
2070;time classic, and inspired by a true story, the sound of music really does live up to its name.
2071;Entirely shot in Salzburg with an A. list cast, the movie bagged five Oscars, including Best Picture.
2072;It showcases the sweeping beauty of Austria.
2073;With Julie Andrews as lead Maria, who won Best Actress for her role as the magical nanny Mary Poppins, she returns with a wonderful performance singing and dancing and mingling with children here.
2074;Charmien Carr, as eldest daughter Liesl, shines too, with her versatile voice and graceful moves (ballet moves, if you call it).
2075;i'd think this is one brilliant film.
2076;as i've mentioned above,A. list actors,breathtaking view and wonderful as well as unforgettable songs.
2077;My 19 year old daughter's favorite movie of all time is the Sound of Music which we've had on VCR for 15+ years and she's watched a million times.
2078;My daughter was very pleased with her belated Christmas present!
2079;It has been a classic since the 60's and it will always be a classic.
2080;julie Andrews and the children make the movie and the supporting cast is excellent also.
2081;The great outdoor shots, the magical songs, the enchanting love story, all combine to provide a very satisfying cinematic experience.
2082;It was amazing!The special features are almost more interesting than the movie itself!
2083;Interviews with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and the actors who played the 7 children, even a tour with one of the actors to visit all of the filming locations and showing the history behind it all.
2084;this is a timeless classic that you and your children and your grandchildren will enjoy over and over.
2085;Shot in pristine color on location near Salzburg.
2086;Music fully deserves its reputation as one of the most popular films of all time.
2087;fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs.
2088;Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible.
2089;The hills are still alive.
2090;"with the wondrous ""Sound of Music."""
2091;I have to admit, my girlfriend likes it better than I.
2092;The scenery is breathtaking, but the musical itself is only good.
2093;"A far, far better musical is ""My Fair Lady"" just for sheer entertainment value."
2094;The dialogue is better, the plot is more interesting and well developed, and the lyrics are far more mature.
2095;"But I do like the ""Sound of Music"" and all should have it for a wonderful family experience."
2096;My Fair Lady is better appreciated among adults.
2097;classic musicals with songs that make me smile.
2098;So I bought it I loved it so much.
2099;Truly a triumphof the human spirit!
2100;And Julie Andrews is remarkable and amazing!
2101;Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice the music is brilliant the movie is great no wonder the is a 45 year anniversary pack.
2102;a lot of family fun.
2103;The movie is a timeless classic and the digitally remastered product makes this even more enjoyable.
2104;Would highly recommend this product.
2105;I don't love this movie because of the music, although it is wonderful.
2106;Many would sneer at this film because it has been so overly made fun of since the Sixties, but perhaps such people should take a closer look at the true depth of the story, like I did.
2107;I went in with an open mind and was literally moved to tears by the story.
2108;The film's true beauty lies not in the cheesy musical numbers or in Julie Andrews dancing around the Alps, but in the courage and determination of the family to sing about life and freedom in the face of Nazi oppression.
2109;The sound of music is the sound of freedom and hope.
2110;Take away the score and the film still stands as a triumph of moviemaking.
2111;What you are watching in this film is not only the great acting, but great acting of a real family (The Trapp Family) who captured the hearts of not only Europe, but the whole world.
2112;as one watches this film, one must imagine in ones mind what these people actually went through.
2113;There are actually a series of three films which make up the story.
2114;The Sound of music wraps it up in one film.
2115;as far as I know, they are all alive and well, living in the USA.
2116;This is one of the best musicals ever to emmanate out of Hollywood.
2117;Julie Andrews is excellent as the virginal young novice Maria, who meets and falls in love with Hot hunk Georg Von Trapp and decides to make a play for him, much to the chagrin of the beautiful Baroness Von Schraeder.
2118;But Maria's pristine good looks and polite manner captivate the Captain and the Baroness gets the boot.
2119;ray is the best way to view a movie other than a movie theater and this one is no exception.
2120;Service for a replacement, excellent.
2121;This is one of the BEST movies ever made, with wonderful songs for everyone in your family to learn and sing along with.
2122;Sound of Music, just as I remembered seeing the movie in the theatre.
2123;Its a true story that inspires me every time and also a classic for the entire family.
2124;This story talks of history, life, values, love, tragic times, and that good people do have a choice to oppose evil in the pursuit of something very worthwhile, which is family.
2125;The Breattaking Landscape , the dazzling performances , and the world's best loved .
2126;Celebrate (2005) the 40th anniversary of THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC , winner of five Academy awards , including Best Picture .
2127;stars as Maria , a spirited young woman who leaves the convent to bring love and music to a Austrian widower Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer 1929 . )
2128;disc set is brimming with all.
2129;ray format, the superb sound, the two.
2130;The music and scenery of this film is spectacular and ageless.
2131;The story is taken from real life which also makes the subject interesting.
2132;Very excited to have this classic in our Blu.
2133;Amazon had a great price and now the hills are alive around here!!
2134;I loved this movies when it first came out as a child, you could sing with it dream with it, and you just flat out enjoyed it who would of thought you could one day own it.
2135;It one the best movies of all times and it always will be.
2136;An Austrian aristocrat family in the 1930s would NEVER EVER eat dinner using just a fork in their right hand.
2137;despite this, the film is wonderful.
2138;one of the greatest musicals of all time.
2139;So glad i got this.
2140;Next time you see it, look for the small details and prepare to be amazed.
2141;Robert Wise was a master filmmaker.
2142;Watch how carefully and beautifully constructed and lit every shot is.
2143;Look at the sets and location shots, who since Robert Wise in 1965 has done created this kind of aching, beautiful detail??
2144;Drop any tendency to be hip while watching this film and allow yourself to be utterly carried away by one of the last opf the master.
2145;crafted films to come out of Hollywood, right on the threshold of Hollywood's decline into self.
2146;goody image, but watch carefully one the most stunningly lovely and frighteningly talented performers of the 20th century.
2147;This is a historically fine performance caught on film that people in the 22nd century will still marvel at.
2148;One of my most favorite movies, couldn't find it anywhere.
2149;Great film with and now with a great Gift Set.
2150;it's probably the drama student in me but I really love musicals and this one by far tops my list.
2151;One of the greatest films of the era!
2152;It touches the heart, and is full of life's beauty.
2153;Great film for those who love music!
2154;This movie is one of my favorites.
2155;This movie is perhaps the most beautiful ever filmed, with good examples and worthy amiracin heroic actions and respect.
2156;Every family should own this movie, it is a good education for the children.
2157;I have to say that this is true.
2158;The new version has a much cleaner picture with less noise and more vivid color than the previous one.
2159;The previous version I own has 4.1 surround.
2160;Add to that many more special features, and I think the 40th Anniversary Edition is one that you will want to add to your collection even if you already own another version of it.
2161;For me, the much improved picture makes it worth the extra cost.
2162;This is a classic, we want our grandchidren to see the movie to enjoy the music and the lovely story.
2163;This is a beautiful 70 mm BLUE RAY print that explodes off of your television screen.
2164;The audio has been punched to new levels and the bonus features are amazing.
2165;This is truly necessary for anyone who has ever seen this film and loved it.
2166;A beautiful restoration of a beautiful film.
2167;this latest incarnation of The Sound of Music offers the best.
2168;"ever presentation of the best R&H
I:18730;2169;The opening shots of the Austrian countryside have never looked more grand, and the outstanding lossless audio track presents the music in its full splendor, sounding every bit like a new movie and not a 40+ year old film.
I:18730;2170;robert Wise's choice of color palette for this film was rather muted, so there aren't really a lot of bright colors to show off, but the darks are superb (""""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"""" is lovely) and the moonlit scenes on the Von Trapp veranda are just gorgeous now."""
2171;"I didn't bother with the deluxe box set (which features the ""My Favorite Things"" box
I:18730;2172;very few musical films achieve both the artistic and cultural significance of The Sound of Music, and Fox has done themselves proud with this latest upgrade of one of the jewels in their crown.
I:18730;2173;Wonderful classic movie that the whole family loves to watch.
I:18730;2174;Picture is good and songs are unforgettable.
I:18730;2175;Such golden moments in cinema history include the world.
I:18730;2176;You know it's a classic already after the first 5 minutes with the long very played.
I:18730;2177;introduces music to the Trapp household and brings forth the charm and merriment that they once knew, and works her charm on the Captain, too.
I:18730;2178;As the children learn to sing, Uncle Max (Richard Haydn) finds that this is the great singing group he's been after to exploit to Salzburg, and the children, Maria and the Captain become the Von Trapp Family Singers.
I:18730;2179;This wonderful, lavish story is set against the backdrop of the Nazi invasion of Austria and the Von Trapp's dodging the Nazis and escaping into Switzerland.
I:18730;2180;I have first seen this film back when I was very small and loved every minute of it.
I:18730;2181;The French female singer dubbing Julie Andrews' songs is actually kind of nice to listen to.
I:18730;2182;Good for music historians and appreciators.
I:18730;2183;Everybody, no matter who they are, should see this film at least once in their lifetime for it is an all.
I:18730;2184;Highly appealing to children as well as adults, """"The Sound of Music"""" is one film that will always be treasured."""
2185;This is a great movie.
2186;It is based on the life of Maria Von Trapp, and has a lot of historical value.
2187;The Music is very heartwarming and you will be singing the songs for days after you watch this movie.
2188;Julie Andrews is great in this.
2189;If you like Musicals, this film is for you!
2190;This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made!
2191;The Sound of Music has a combination of wonderful cast (Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker, Charmian Carr etc., etc., etc.,) It also has stunning views of Austria and is one of the most romantic love stories.
2192;Its packaging is beautiful and the widescreen version of it is amazing.
2193;The Sound of Music is a must for anyone that ever set foot on this planet.
2194;R&H's last musical was their greatest.
2195;The Sound of Music is packed with wonderful songs, everyone one of them classics, known around the world.
2196;these songs are all classics that will continue to bring a smile to chidren's and adult's faces for years to come.
2197;There is something about it that just makes you smile and watch it over and over again.
2198;The wonderful morals of love conquers all, and what trusting in God can do ring loud and clear.
2199;"This movie still is enormously popular even today and it proves that the Sound of Music clearly is still, and forever will be, ""The Happiest Sound in all the World!"""
2200;I enjoyed this movie because it is a great family movie with a great plot.
2201;i have always enjoyed seeing Christopher Plumer and Julie Andrews preform.
2202;This movie is the best movie ever made.
2203;Excellent in every aspect from the acting, music, cinematography and directing a true American classic.
2204;This IS what a musical is all about.
2205;This is the main reason why this flick is soooooo successful and i can't get any of those d@mn songs out of my head!Warning: It is very addicitive ( the songs ) and you will be humming it loudly at the office the next days.
2206;This was a brand new movie and was fun to watch.
2207;It was worth every penny!
2208;This film was a big surprise for 20th Century Fox, which got a huge hit when something more modest was expected.
2209;The people who made the film were amazed at it's popularity, but it is quite well made and well performed and isn't too sugary sweet.
2210;I find it excellent family fare and they don't make that many good family films these days.
2211;Perhaps he is just tired of talking about it but I still enjoy his work as Captain von Trapp.
2212;I have watched this on tv since I was a child and the 40th anniversary was well worth the money spent.
2213;I will enjoy this with my children for many years to come.
2214;Great movie, wonderful songs, gorgeous scenery, romance, reverance, drama, life lessons, values like courage .
2215;If you are a fan then this is a Must.
2216;This is great for the whole family.
2217;Every age can enjoy it and it never get old.
2218;Love, love, love this music.
2219;The thing that makes it so high in my book is about the script.
2220;After all these years, this film is still such great entertainment.
2221;My 3 year old loves this movie although she doesn't understand it.
2222;She loves the music machine option, where just the songs along with the movie are played.
2223;Great I bought it for a gift and they really really liked it and got it on time!It came wrapped and was a surprise
2224;I really enjoyed being able to see this film in my own home at my own time.
2225;The movie is excellent but be sure your player will handle it.
2226;Sound of Music is a classic I enjoyed watching with my grandmother growing up.
2227;Now my daughter, who's only 6, enjoys it as much as I did!
2228;This is a great investment.
2229;This is a timeless tale of a novice nun named Maria (Julie Andrews) who is sent to be a governess for the seven von Trapp children.
2230;She introduces spirit, fun, and best of all music back into the house.
2231;She not only captures the hearts of his seven children, but ends up capturing the captain's heart as well.
2232;The attraction is immediate, but it's not until later in the movie that the attraction is realized with the breathtaking 'Laendler'.
2233;With her breathtaking voice and superb acting skills, she takes this glorious film to a whole new dimension.
2234;This film is without a doubt the best musical ever made.
2235;"In my opinion, ""The Sound of Music"" is the best musical of the 20th century."
2236;Not only does it provide hours of wonderful music, comedy, and beautiful landscapes, but it teaches historical facts.
2237;Furthermore, it is a wonderful and safe movie for children.
2238;A beautiful film in every sense.
2239;We loved it and will watch it again.
2240;One of my all time favorite movies finally available in the Blu.
2241;ray conversion is excellent, not like some of the other movies, like Godfather for one example which is too contrasty and too grainy on the Blu.
2242;excellent deal for a very good price well worth every penny I paid for it.
2243;this movie, an all time classic, is the greatest movie ever made.
2244;I have watched this movie over twenty times and each time there is something more beautiful about it.
2245;I guess too, its because I love children, beautiful music and romance and this movie covers them all.
2246;This is truly a family move and I encourage everyone to watch it.
2247;There is a spark here that fulfills expectation and makes the world just seem a little lighter on your shoulders.
2248;It IS a good movie and if you've never seen it before you really should, as it has some roots in true events.
2249;your head may explode with all that high.
2250;It was a present for my wife and she loves it.
2251;Has a lot of nice extras.
2252;Would highly recommend for the big Sound of Music fan.
2253;This is just a classic movie I enjoy watching.

I:18730;2257;The books complement the movie and the whole box just has a special feel when you open it.
I:18730;2258;THE SOUND OF MUSIC holds many happy memories for me, first when I saw many years ago at the movie theater and then as a perennial classic around Thanksgiving.
I:18730;2259;It is a happy film, very uplifting, with a happy ending.
I:18730;2260;The ending is so moving that it makes me cry every time I see it and the Von Trapp family walking along the hilltop in beautiful bright sunshine into freedom and happiness.
I:18730;2261;If you have never seen this movie, you've got to see it.
I:18730;2262;Good sound, good story beautiful scenery.

I:18730;2270;If one wants to know the real story of the Von Trapp's, they can always research it.
I:18730;2271;Julie Andrews is always wonderful to watch, and this is one of her best.
I:18730;2272;But the songs are classic, the scenery aswell and the final like a thriller.

I:18730;2282;The renditions of it on blu ray and normal disc, worth every penny to get it!
I:18730;2283;The details are so clear, that you can see the hazel.
I:18730;2284;I give Carrie Underwood credit for going for such a huge role, but Julie Andrews will always be my favorite!!

I:18730;2286;She loves her dress she wears when she sings on the mountain top.

2419;The chorus of smiling nuns is equally recognizable.
2420;Plummer and Andrews' wistful last scene on stage in Salzbug is moving.
2421;grossing film of all time, and, inflation adjusted, it still stands in the top ten.
2422;The continuing popularity of this film is amazing, especially considering that four decades later the movie musical is all but dead.

2477;This is truly a classic .
2478;great story, great music, great singing.
2479;Absolutely beautiful movie so much more meaningful now than when I watched it as a child :.)
2480;The scope of the soundtrack is breathtaking and the characters all flow together harmoniously :.)
2481;It's worth the regular reduced price, for sure.
2482;The box is about the size of a board game, and is packed full of content.
2483;If you're a serious lover of this classic film, this is the set to get.
2484;"The reminiscence by Andrews and Plummer is worthwhile as well and the ""Biography"" episode ""The Von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord"" will certainly open your eyes to the ""true"" story behind it all."
2485;The first thing that works is that Robert Wise frontloads this movie big time.
2486;"We begin with the wonderful descent of the camera from the clouds until it finds Maria on top of the mountain, where she bursts into the title song and makes it clear that the beautiful vistas of Austria are integral to this film (it did for Salzburg, Austria what ""The Lord of the Rings"" did for New Zealand)."
2487;"After the overture during the title credits we have the ""Preludium (Dixit Dominus),"" during which Wise presents us with some stunningly beautiful shots of nuns at prayer, establishing weight to the religious elements of the film."
2488;"Then when we get to ""Maria"" the Mother Superior and the rest of the nuns strike absolutely the right tone for singing a cute song while dressed in habits."
2489;Once we get past the opening of the movie where Wise so beautifully sets the stage for the film, the person who deserves a lot of the credit is screenwriter Ernest Lehman.
2490;"Pay attention to how he sets up the songs so that the seque from dialogue to singing is more naturalistic (""My Favorite Things"" is a prime example of this in the film)."
2491;Lehman's script also turned the Captain into a more of a fully developed human being than the martinet of the Broadway version.
2492;That, of course, becomes the show piece of the film as Maria and the children tour Salzburg and the countryside singing, which gets us back to the wonderful scenery that Wise highlights from the opening moment of the film.
2493;She sound like she be whining a lot.
2494;Always loved The Sound of Music movie with Julie Andrews.
2495;the music, the scenery, and kids, except for the war part, which carries a saddening tone for the whole piece.
2496;The Movie is worth five stars.
2497;I thought it was a great price considering it came with all that was described in the photo.
2498;It actually looks much nicer and bigger in person.
2499;A classic movie that is worth every penny!
2500;The scenery are enhanced beautifully on the Blu.
2501;The commentaries are very enlightening.
2502;The video was in good condition and provided as much enjoyment as I received the first time I saw it.
2503;I gave it to friends who are Sound of Music NUTS and they were thrilled with all the extra features!!!
2504;My little great niece loves this movie and now she can watch it anytime she wants to.
2505;I can not wait to share the music of this timeless treasure with my family.
2506;nevertheless, this is an interesting addition to one's collection.
2507;"a film about challenging traditional family values in a ""discomforting"" environment."
2508;The stories in the books are very interesting and the pictures are fun to look at.
2509;this is something the whole family will enjoy!
2510;Brings back alot of memories of being young.
2511;It truely is almost like seeing it for the first time, heck, a lot of stuff you ARE seeing for the first time!
2512;ray see this, my hat is off to you all, you did a beautiful job.
2513;What a great film for all ages!
2514;Prepare to have a sing.
2515;i loved this movie since I saw it for the first time back in 1965.
2516;So it's nice tonow own the movie and have it in such a beautiful box.
2517;Sound of Music has always been my favorite movie.
2518;Julie Andrews is the greatest, and can sing a phone book.
2519;It was so wonderful to see it I could not turn it off.
2520;I bought this as a gift for my grandma.
2521;Whenever I visit we watch it together.
2522;that makes it well worth it to have .
2523;also it includes an original intermission which is great due to its length!
2524;our old VHS was in the letterbox format, and you miss much of the wonderful vistas which are part of the movie.
2525;Amazon's digital copy is excellent.
2526;Superb story follows the true story pretty faithfully.
2527;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are magnificent and believable playing Maria and Captain VonTrapp.
2528;The brutality of the Nazis was implied well in a family friendly movie.
2529;My kids loved the movie, my wife has loved it from her first viewing on the TV years ago.
2530;I got it on time and it was just like the comments said it was.
2531;I also enjoyed the movie
2532;I really enjoyed all of this musical .
2533;"the actors are well chosen
I:18730;2534;it's quite a change from most that is out there.
I:18730;2535;all were portrayed realistically,and very honestly.
I:18730;2536;the nuns are shown as normal human beings,with a very positive image of Mother Abbot .
I:18730;2537;My family loves this movie and we finally bought a copy.
I:18730;2538;This is a true classic and one we will watch over and over again!
I:18730;2539;This is one of my favorite movies, I love the plot, the music, and the beautiful places.
I:18730;2540;This is my favorite Christmas movie.
I:18730;2541;release, I was very excited by it.
I:18730;2542;they come and go, and the picture remains, great as it is.
I:18730;2543;Rogers and Hammerstein outdid themselves on this one, which is good since it was the last collaboration before Oscar died.
I:18730;2544;from that moment on, the picture was a guaranteed hit.
I:18730;2545;If you ever listen to Mary Martin sing the title song on the original Broadway cast version, she does a nice quiet job of it.
I:18730;2546;The other shots as the children go round with their new governess through the gardens of Mirabel are just lovely.
I:18730;2547;i think the supporting cast is particularly good: Peggy Wood as Reverend Mother is outstanding, singing or not.
I:18730;2548;But Angela Cartwright and Charmian Carr are excellent actresses both.
I:18730;2549;I guess it's funny that I can dislike the two main performances as much as I do, and still like this picture, but that's one of the mysteries of life, I guess.
I:18730;2550;Everything is somewhat white and gold and gray.
I:18730;2551;it's the one vibrant color in the whole picture.
I:18730;2552;overall, though, """"The Sound of Music"""" is one of the supreme movie musical achievements."""
2553;It will make a wonderful Christmas gift for my family as it was a movie we went to together in high school one snowy day in New York.
2554;My grandchildren and I l loved to watch this together.
2555;I love the the sound of music .
2556;packaging of this product was fantastic.
2557;I am 22 now and I watch this movie at LEAST once a week!Working in the mental health profession, it really helps me relax!
2558;In 2099 I hope everyone will still be singing about their favorite things!
2559;I received this movie earlier than expected and it was in perfect condition.
2560;I really appreciate the service that is given when I order through Amazon.
2561;I actually bought The Sound Of Music for my uncle.
2562;The movie was just as promised, and the speed with which the order was processed was terrific!
2563;It is worth every penny and so much more!
2564;This set will make a wonderful display in my curio cabinet for years to come.
2565;I think it is also a wonderful set to pass down to younger generations in your family as an heirloom.
2566;still, these are minor complaints in a moving story based on a real life adventure.
2567;It's great to see this true world tale brought to the big screen with such beauty.
2568;the scenes in Austria are just beautiful, from the elegant dances to the gorgeous landscapes.
2569;From her pure voice to the glow in her cheeks as she falls in love, she is an ideal heroine.
2570;Yes, in part it was about the captain, but it was about life in general, and she was talking about herself as much as Julie.
2571;a great movie well worth watching and rewatching for the pure joy of the story.
2572;Forgot what a great movie this was!
2573;Great memories for her and me.
2574;Got this for myself so that I could teach my kids to love the musicals I loved as a kid.
2575;I still love this movie!!!!!!!
2576;great movie to share with your kids.
2577;continues to thrill kids of all ages The whole family loves this movie.
2578;Give as a special gift
2579;Throw away your VHS tapes and enjoy the difference.
2580;The movie, as you probably already know, is fantastic.
2581;made and the entire family can (and should) watch it.
2582;I have watched it hundreds of times and will watch it again and again and again.
2583;I know I put 3 stars, you have to put in something.
2584;It's one of my favorite movies.
2585;PERFECT gift for anyone who loves this classic story!
2586;I watched The Sound of Music with my family 3 times a year for my whole childhood and I could probably recite this movie from start to finish.
2587;It's a 3 hour long movie and he only made it about half way through but it is still as good as it always will be.
2588;This is a wonderful family story showing love, trust, loyalty and strength.
2589;I think it will always be a classic.
2590;I watched this as a young girl and now my 6 year old has learned all the songs from the movie.
2591;we quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian.
2592;We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world.
2593;Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss.
2594;The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe.
2595;inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical.
2596;every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat.
2597;Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards.
2598;Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs.
2599;The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy.
2600;though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents.
2601;Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste.
2602;The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting.
2603;"I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50"" television with stereo speakers."
2604;In some scenes the color is excellent.
2605;this movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should.
2606;You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family.
2607;I love The Sound of Music!!
2608;Rogers and Hammerstein musicals are in my oppinion the best musicals there are!
2609;I recommend The Sound of Music to just about anyone and everyone.
2610;I love the extras that you get.
2611;Love the opening panorama, great remembrance of my trip to Salzburg.
2612;One of my favorite movies.
2613;A movie for the whole family.
2614;Still, it was a good movie and I was in awe of both the vocal talent (I've always loved Julie Andrews) as well as the story line behind it.
2615;I got it two days from XMas, and my sister loved it.
2616;time, and I enjoyed the movie quite a lot.
2617;I enjoyed watching 'Sound of Music' when I was a little girl.
2618;Now my children loves it, too.
2619;Great for a family movie night.
2620;I have loved this movie ever since it come out on the big screen.
2621;Nice to have both type of blu.
2622;Good price but wish it also had the digital copy included.
2623;This movie was amazing with its beautiful music that has lasted decades, and lovely scenery that captures the true essence of the setting.
2624;It's a movie for ages 8 and up, with its vast use of everyday situations.
2625;I've always been a fan of The Sound of Music ever since I was young.
2626;Hearing the songs takes me back to my childhood!
2627;This box set is so wonderful!
2628;I don't know that I'll use it much, but a nice extra!
2629;So interesting and great to know that the movie actually follows a true story!
2630;For the price, I would highly recommend it!
2631;Great gift that I gave myself this Christmas!
2632;A thoughtful gift for anyone that loves the Sound of Music.
2633;Oh sure, there are moments that Post.
2634;moderns will rate as camp and kitsch, but the overall effect of this lively musical can lift even the most cynical urbanites.
2635;Maria, The Captain and the troupe evidence the best in human nature, and director Wise .
2636;vividly paints a sylvan, civilized world threatened by the barbarism of encroaching Nazis and Fascists.
2637;but it's wonderful family entertainment, and a lyrical illustration of 'where the day can take you' if you have the courage to listen to your heart.
2638;Let down your armor and enjoy this timeless gem, and in the words of the Old Sister belting out at the window, 'follow every rainbow, til you find your dream'.
2639;A 1965 movie musical to do the above?You bet.
2640;The moment the movie started I was transported, through my humble surroundings, to a grand movie palace as I knew as a kid in the 60's.
2641;The sound ~ full rich, the picture ~ sharp, lush, and brilliant, and the total Artistry it took to create the film version of the beloved Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical ~ all combine to overwhelm one's senses in ways that most films cannot or will not do today.
2642;Bought 2 of these because my daughter and I both love this movie.
2643;It is one of my daughter's favorites
2644;Good clean movie, hard to find these days!
2645;Good movie to watch if you don't mind some singing. . .
2646;bought it for my granddaughter.
2647;This version has the best cast and music, and the scenery is amazing.
2648;The music, the acting, the scenery are breathtaking, universal and timeless (seamless).
2649;I bought this for my Grandkids and they are loving it.
2650;All in all a really good deal
2651;its everything someone who grew up with the movie would want, it was a great price for so much.
2652;My young children memorized the lyrics so fast!
2653;One of the best musicals ever produced.
2654;Each song is memorable and the cast is superb.
2655;mi is a very good song to remember the first three notes of the music!!
2656;The music and story are uplifting.
2657;I bought this for my mom for christmas and it is a really nice set!
2658;I love that is came with a lot of books on the actors and talks about the true story.
2659;And it comes with pics of the family!
2660;It also has a music box!
2661;But it was only in one spot.
2662;All in all I would totally recommend this set for a gift or yourself!
2663;It recaptures what I love most about Europe and the old.
2664;Julie Andrews is absolutely adorable and delightful to watch.
2665;Best musical of all time.
2666;Scenery, songs, dancing, romance and nuns in a thrilling ending!
2667;The 45th Anniversary Edition of The Sound of Music is fantastic.
2668;The color, clarity detail and music blew me away.
2669;Unbelievable value on a must have classic.
2670;There's lots and lots of great stuff in this package.
2671;ray is such an experience.
2672;The sound of Music is definetely an inspired movie, a gift for many generations!
2673;I have watched and watched, I grew up with it and now my kids love it!Maria D.[.]
2674;My wife loves the movie and I just gave it to her as a Christmas present.
2675;The is a wind up music box, lithograph and book included in the set.
2676;I was able to get the set at a much discounted price and it was more than worth it.
2677;She said definitely yes it was much clearer.
2678;It is interesting, fun and encouraging to see how this family made it through such a hard time in history.
2679;Thank you for a great product.
2680;Already SOUND OF MUSIC is a film that perhaps belongs to the Top 100 films of all time and to have a set that is excellent in all its forms is just amazing!We hope you sell more of this.
2681;We will definitely look at your other products.
2682;It's beautiful, although we don't own a Blu.
2683;I loved this movie as a child and was super excited to share it with my boys.
2684;But I just finished watching the movie in its entirety (it lasts close to three hours) for the first time ever, and it truly is as magnificent as everyone said it was.
2685;the story is simple, yet powerful: a story of search, love and struggle, starring Julie Andrews playing Maria, a woman who leaves an Austrian convent to assist Captain Georg von Trapp (Michael Plummer), a widower Navy officer with the upbringing of his seven children.
2686;The Sound of Music has got to be without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in my life and a story I will hold dear to my heart.
2687;i love all music in this movie!!!
2688;I found myself squinting at the screen on occasion (and I have a large television, mind you) just to catch the details.
2689;disc Two is the real scene stealer.
2690;screen, so that was a relief.
2691;And that really speaks volumes for the qaulity of this Disc.
2692;I highly recommend this item as a collectible item.
2693;This is the best musical ever made!
2694;Julie Andrews is simply fantastic!
2695;This is surely something that can't be missed!
2696;It's a beautiful story, full of joy and, of course, music!
2697;Not to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent!
2698;It's total fun and entertainment for the entire family, a drop.
2699;wonderful movie that everyone must see!!

2703;downs The Sound of Music has received over the years (it was too long, boring, sickly irritatingly sweet, sentimental, saccharine, treacle, corny, etc.) I sincerely believe it is one of the finest musicals ever made.
2704;All the performances are pitch perfect, the main characters are full three.
2705;dimensional people, the screenplay has dialogue crackling with wit, humor and spark and every song has a simple, sweet, endearing melody.
2706;I mean, direction is all about bringing out the best in your actors, how you envision every scene and a Picture nomination means the movie as a whole (cinematography, sets, costumes, music, directing, screenwriting AND acting.)
2707;What makes her such an endearing character is how she devotes herself to the children and helps the Captain understand that he should love and cherish them while their still young.
2708;Her crystal clear voice (speaking too) is always a pleasure to the ears.
2709;Every note is like a delicate glass bell and her superb diction makes every song sound like she is telling a poem.
2710;christopher Plummer gives an excellent performance as the cold, sarcastic, stern father who slowly softens up and learns to appreciate the joys of family life again.
2711;I love the way the screenplay treats the relationship between him and Maria and even though you know its going to end in romance it develops so slowly and gradually that it feels real.
2712;She could easily have been the villain of the piece.
2713;Elsa tries to get rid of Maria but when Maria comes back she can tell that the captain and her truly love each other and fit together perfectly.
2714;She understands and wants them to be happy so she gracefully breaks off her engagement.
2715;Robert Wise wisely (no pun intended) cut Elsas songs from the score to help emphasize that Maria fits in with the family better.
2716;robert Wise's direction is flawless.
2717;He brings out the best in every actor and stages every sequence perfectly.
2718;I especially admired how he quickly made the transition from whimsical and light.
2719;hearted throughout most of the movie to the intense and suspenseful last fifteen minutes in the Abbey, especially the cemetery sequence.
2720;the cinematography contains soft pastel shades of earth and flesh tones.
2721;sepia, brown, gray, green, blue and white.
2722;It was really like discovering it for the first time.
2723;"I love Rodgers and Hammerstein's musicals (all of them really pathed the way for the ""serious"" American musical) and this one is really far more endearing in retrospect than I had remembered."
2724;For one thing the story, which really has little to do with the real story of the Von Trapp Singers, is very moving, uplifting and even spiritual.
2725;It really is a story about personal triumph, the importance of honor and brotherhood and courage and there's certainly nothing wrong with the beautiful music.
2726;I loved the reunion of the kids, most of them are my age today, and just adored Miss Andrews's introductions.
2727;The music is absolutely spectacular!!!!
2728;Even my kids loved it!
2729;I love showing them the classics!!
2730;There is intrigue with a surprise ending.
2731;This is my absolutely favorite movie of all time.
2732;This is a real treat!
2733;I got this so fast after ordering.
2734;It was a gift to my grandaughter.
2735;She loved it then and loves it more now.
2736;No matter how many times I have seen this movie it is great it makes you laugh and happy and even sad.
2737;The songs always make you feel young again and the happy ending makes it complete
2738;Many family members have enjoyed this for years as it is simply timeless.
2739;What a History lesson, a reminder as the the true cost of freedom, and why we need to protect them.
2740;well done, a reminder as to why America has always been in love with Julie Andrews.
2741;I love this story and my grandson, also loves it.
2742;We are so happy to have a great movie that we can watch at our leasure.
2743;Great songs, great actors, and great everything!It's a real life story, it really happened.
2744;so good novice nun in the Abbey.
2745;The Captain(Christopher Plummer) is very strict and it's up to Maria to brighten the family up.
2746;"The songs are magnificent and I love the ""Do Re Mi"" and the main song ""Sound of Music""."
2747;the Austrian scenery is very beautiful and I'm really sure anybody would enjoy this film!
2748;The movie is a classic, of course.
2749;The songs keep going through my head night and day.
2750;such a wonderful movie, we need more like this for generations to come!
2751;I love the movie and since I was in Salzburg and took The Sound of Music tour I love it even more!
2752;This movie is a family movie and the story on which it is based is compelling to read and makes the movie enjoyable to watch.
2753;The songs in the movie are nice and which I grew up with.
2754;ray version and will love watching it with my children when time permits.
2755;Such a beautiful movie, with a soundtrack that will not leave your head for days.
2756;This Product is most elligent.
2757;The story hasn't changed, it is as great as ever, but the package is full of special surprises you will enjoy even between viewings.
2758;She truly wants to devote her life to God, but struggles with the rules.
2759;The Sound of Music is one of those feel good films.
2760;I smile the entire way through it.
2761;In my mind, it's Rogers and Hammerstein's best musical.
2762;All the songs are easily singable and memorable.
2763;Yet these songs are set into a fun love story against an interesting back drop.
2764;In spite of these things, I still love the movie version, however.
2765;the two disc set is a wonderful way to own this classic movie.
2766;The picture and sound are wonderful, and the disc is packed with information.
2767;I especially enjoyed the documentary on the second disc because it includes information on the real von Trapps.
2768;If you're looking for the perfect disc to own, this is it.
2769;It may be harder to track down the two disc edition, but in my mind, it's well worth it.
2770;No need to review this movie which is well known and beloved.
2771;the special packaging is great.
2772;i got a great price on this set from amazon.
2773;good value for the price.
2774;My kids love to watch and sing along to it .
2775;it's classic for a reason.
2776;perfect for little ones who love the music but are not yet mature enough for the other content.
2777;A 'timeless classic' as they like to say.
2778;there is a 'graininess' to the picture that really surprised me.
2779;Then I found the 45th Anniversary collection for a great price!
2780;The combo works well for all players.
2781;If these are still being sold and you want your own combo collection of The Sound of Music, then I highly recommend this 45th anniversary blu.
2782;It is a classic to be enjoyed by everyone!
2783;All I can say is WOW!
2784;Right from the first opening scene where Julie Andrews is twirling on the mountain top as the camera moves in, you can actually make out tiny yellow and pink flowers in the grass!!!
2785;The images are so sharp that the actual grain of the film can be seen.
2786;The extras on disc two are quite nice.
2787;I really enjoyed the bits about the technical aspect of restoring the film for hi def.
2788;Either way, the film is amazing to look at in this format.
2789;A large thanks to the talented people who restored such a precious piece of our cinema history.
2790;Our whole family really enjoyed this edition due to the interviews and commentaries that allow us into the Van Trapp (sp)family and what happened to them during and after this real life event.
2791;This edition is clean and shows well.
2792;I bought this as a Christmas present for someone, and for the price, this is amazing!
2793;Her faith is genuine, but she's really too much of a free spirit to fit into the quiet, orderly ways of the nuns.
2794;Maria is appalled at the Captain's cold, militaristic interactions with his children.
2795;The Captain goes to Vienna to see his girlfriend, the elegant Baroness Schrader.
2796;While he's away, Maria, quite the hand with her needle stretching her available yardage to fit 7 kids, makes the children play clothes out of her old curtains.
2797;"He is first appalled but slowly delighted at the change Maria has wrought in his family, and is even persuaded to sing ""Edelweiss"" accompanying himself on the guitar."
2798;The movie takes some rather large liberties with the facts.
2799;The Captain was a perfectly pleasant fellow.
2800;for someone who's been cloistered in a convent, Maria has an awful lot of wisdom about children and family life.
2801;The children are all too sweet for words, and most of the songs are so sweet they make your teeth ache.
2802;There's something irresistibly innocent and charming about the proceedings.
2803;In my view, The Sound of Music could arguably be the film of the century or even the greatest film ever made.
2804;with wonderful panoramas in the Austrian Alps, good versus evil and wonderful music and story line and spoton cinematography.
2805;All the acting is first rate and believable and what is better that it is a true story.
2806;i remember it with fond memories as my first ever boy girl date.
2807;What is even more remarkable, in the citywhere I lived the movie played for over a year in the same theatre.
2808;Thus my view that it is the greatest movie of all time
2809;These are a few of my favorite things!
2810;This is my favorite movie, and my children learnt to love this movie through me.
2811;For my family, it is a special movie.
2812;I have an old edition but this anniversary special edition is great, the color has been improved, and the extras are big pluses.
2813;This movie is still as good today as when I first watch it in my youth.
2814;It was the first time for my daughter and she really enjoyed all the singing.
2815;It is an excellent movie that the whole family can really enjoyed.
2816;This is one, of my favorite movies I saw it when I was, little and it's still one of my favorites, the songs are great, eventhough it's old it's still good.
2817;it's worth watching you'll love it for the intire, family!
2818;Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews' pas de deux scene is so romantic.
2819;Because this story is based on a real live woman of God makes Maria Von Trapp even more inspiring.
2820;The scenes of Austria and the mountains are wonderful, the music is inspired, and the interactions Maria has with her religious superiors refreshingly true.
2821;The evil that is symbolized by the Nazi atmosphere is neutralized by Maria's goodness, and brings to fruition the family's successful escape from Austria.
2822;The Captain's duty to his call to arms (to an evil Fuhrer) naturally yields to the stronger call to love of Maria and for his family.
2823;The acting is superb, the sets are gorgeous and the musical scenes are charming.
2824;It is Julie Andrews'and Christopher Plummer's most memorable work and it needs to be always included in the classics of all time.
2825;This movie is an all time favorite of mine.
2826;I make myself popcorn, have a soft drink, and enjoy it from start to finish.
2827;It is just a wonderful feel good movie.
2828;The scenery is just so breathtaking .
2829;The movie is a classic, one that we watch as a family every year.
2830;It's great to be able to talk about Nazi Germany with the children so they understand somewhat what the Haloucost was.
2831;The movie is well done, funny in parts, and the singing is lovely.
2832;It's fun to see Julie Andrews as a young woman (despite the worst hairdo ever).
2833;And Sound of Music is a magnificent film.
2834;I give it my highest rating
2835;We learned and sang along to ALL of the songs, knew the children's names, demeanors, as well as anticipated the entire plot unfolding each time it aired on TV.
2836;My mother loved music, movies, comedy and fun.

I:18730;2994;The Sound of Music is a timeless film.
I:18730;2995;time favorite movie being presented in its ultimate form!!
I:18730;2996;I well remember seeing this movie when it was first released, going to Lincon Road Theatre in Miami Beach.
I:18730;2997;the movie is made so well ( cinematography,acting, singing, directing, score, etc) from all aspects you neverreally tire of seeing it.
I:18730;2998;Funny thing is what inspired us to watch this movie again this year was we started watching the new version with Carrie Underwood and we didn't really like it.
I:18730;2999;So we had to see the original with Julie Andrews and Christoper Plummer and thoroughly enjoyed seeing itagain.

I:18730;3002;I've watched """"The Sound of the Music"""" few times before on a laser disc, and enjoyed it vey much."""

I:18730;3049;This family eventually moved to Vermont up in Stowe where one of the HGTV Dream Homes was built.
I:18730;3050;all the neat little things that were included in the box set made it very special.
I:18730;3051;Any Sound of Music fan would really appreciate this and find it a great investment!
I:18730;3052;The Sound of Music is one of the great film musicals of all time.
I:18730;3053;I love this picture and I always have.
I:18730;3054;an incredible amount of effort has gone into bringing The Sound of Music to Blu.
I:18730;3055;ray, and the clarity of the new image struck from the original negative is remarkable.
I:18730;3056;It's wonderful to see such loving attention given to a classic film.
I:18730;3057;While not in the same league of color exaggeration as Gone With The Wind (for instance), The Sound of Music has backgrounds lit with multi.
I:18730;3058;colored lights to imply moonlight, firelight, etc.
I:18730;3059;like atmosphere of the movie, and give the cinematography its rich look.
I:18730;3060;Scenes glow with golden sunlight or cool moonlight, and there's a stylized look which I remember from seeing the film on the big screen in the 70's.
I:18730;3061;There's something about the newly.
I:18730;3062;the previous edition of this film just looked better, richer and more artistic.
I:18730;3063;ray transfer, but the colors and aesthetic presented by the older edition are, in my opinion, more in keeping with the filmmakers original intention.
I:18730;3064;it just shows you how much of an art form color correction and film transfer can be.
I:18730;3065;ray transfer ELEVATED the picture.
I:18730;3066;ray version is like seeing it for the first time, seriously.

I:18730;3076;I felt like I was alive with the Sound of Music .
I:18730;3077;It is timeless and a great family film.
I:18730;3078;Julie Andrews has a beautiful voice, as does Christopher Plummer.
I:18730;3079;I have read books on the real Von Trapp family, and certainly, Hollywood took some liberties, however, because it's such a wonderful film, we can forgive them!
I:18730;3080;My daughter loves this one better than the remake with Carrie Underwood.
I:18730;3081;Came in perfect new condition.
I:18730;3082;I just received the new, updated blue ray version of the Sound of Music and enjoyed it all over again.
I:18730;3083;I especially liked the added, behind the scenes clips.

I:18730;3085;Just a sweet fun movie everyone loves.
I:18730;3086;It was so Good that I bought it.
I:18730;3087;A classic that never fails to make you bond together as a family and be grateful for what is really important in life.
I:18730;3088;The ability to skip scenes back and forth was wonderful for when I had to leave the set.
I:18730;3089;was going to give this as a gift.
I:18730;3090;other than that, everything is very nicely done.
I:18730;3091;Very important with a splendidly visual movie such as this one.
I:18730;3092;And of course the content is in my opinion the best musicals ever made.
I:18730;3093;ray version, ofcoz I got it too.
I:18730;3094;Since wide screen television sets were introduced for use in homes, I have looked for the perfect family movie for a wide screen TV.
I:18730;3095;The blue ray version of The Sound of Music is the perfect family film for a wide screen television set.
I:18730;3096;From the outstanding panorama shot of the Alps at the beginning of the movie to the end, this blue ray transfer shines.
I:18730;3097;This 3 disc present station includes a wealth of extras.
I:18730;3098;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are still glorious and distinguished, and their chemistry still exists in a 2005 interview, yet watching them in this movie assures that chemistry and their beauty as a couple forever in movie history.
I:18730;3099;If you loved it in 1965, you'll want to have it now on blu.
I:18730;3100;This 45th Anniversary Edition is amazing!!
I:18730;3101;As great as the picture is, the sound is better!!
I:18730;3102;we knew every word by heart, and never grew tired of it.20 years later, I still love The Sound of Music.
I:18730;3103;The on screen chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is in itself worth watching the movie for.
I:18730;3104;The love stories, heartbreak, Maria's journey to self discovery, the delightful von Trapp children, and the building political unrest between the Jews and the Nazis are skilfully blended by Robert Wise to make it a timeless masterpiece.
I:18730;3105;aside from the story, the breathtaking Austrian scenery is not to be missed.
I:18730;3106;The Sound of Music held it's ground as the best ever musical between 1965 .
I:18730;3107;1978 when finally the musical Grease won the top spot.
I:18730;3108;Julie Andrews sings beautifully, which comes through much better in Blu.
I:18730;3109;The imagery of the hills, lakes, and trees come through so vivid and alive it is infectious in its life.
I:18730;3110;The story is uplifting, the acting is above par, and my memory's grow fonder.
I:18730;3111;A great movie, though it does seem a bit long for very young viewers.
I:18730;3112;Definitely a drama/humorous video, NOT an action movie or true comedy.
I:18730;3113;I have the 2 disc set and I was amazed at the transfer and sound.
I:18730;3114;This is the way musicals should be done.
I:18730;3115;The songs are memorable and there is a good story with dialogue!
I:18730;3116;The story will hold your interest, the kids are charming and Julie Andrews is a very talented captivating beauty!
I:18730;3117;It's a 3 hour movie, but it did move along at a fairly quick pace.
I:18730;3118;Good music, and a good recording of it.
I:18730;3119;ray certainly sounds and looks better than the vhs copy.
I:18730;3120;If you have a surround sound system that can take advantage of the uncompressed audio, the musical numbers will bring a smile to your face.
I:18730;3121;My wife and I immediately found this Blue.
I:18730;3122;It is worth every cent we paid and then some.
I:18730;3123;So happy to have this on Blu.
I:18730;3124;There are so few movies that families can enjoy together, even my jaded older children (who say it is corny) end up sitting and watching it when I put it on.
I:18730;3125;This is a classic for all time.
I:18730;3126;The Sound of Music is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:18730;3127;ray edition with restored picture and sound is absolutely gorgeous.
I:18730;3128;Finally, I format that does this classic the justice it deserves.
I:18730;3129;I got the limited edition combo for Christmas, and I love all the special extras.
I:18730;3130;This is a great classic.
I:18730;3131;I bought it for my Mother because she likes the movie so much.
I:18730;3132;The songs in it are catchy, and it has a nice love story.
I:18730;3133;A great family movie when there are really none these days.
I:18730;3134;By the way after my Mom watched this version she was glad to see the extra footage.
I:18730;3135;She was really happy to have it.
I:18730;3136;This is one complete fabulous collection.
I:18730;3137;The packaging is neat, the contents well arranged and really appealing.
I:18730;3138;ray of movie, 1 Blu.
I:18730;3139;Highly recommended if you have ear for good musical film.

I:18730;3141;I considered purchasing this as a gift for someone as well.
I:18730;3142;This was a gift for my mom, and she loved this.
I:18730;3143;as soon as she got this, she watched right away.
I:18730;3144;This movie is definitely a classic worth watching.
I:18730;3145;The family in this story is so sweet as they melt your heart with lovely melodies of another place and time.
I:18730;3146;Noticeable is the theme of being brave enough to do what is right even when it is not easy.
I:18730;3147;I am a big fan of The Sound of Music.
I:18730;3148;The download is excellent and I enjoyed seeing the film again.
I:18730;3149;I have seen this movie many many times"

3151;Bought this for my wife she loves this movie and she really loved all the side pieces the books and music box are very nice.
3152;We got reacquainted with this movie and how great a performance Julie Andrews gave.
3153;A great gift for anyone who is a fan!
3154;I love the music, the scenery, and the story.
3155;depending on your point of view Julie Andrews is most popular for The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins.
3156;Both are wonderful movies and seem to get better with age.
3157;With the power of her smile and singing she wins over not only the kids but their father as well.
3158;The casting was perfect, the scenery beautiful, the music timeless, and the story inspiring.
3159;Wish every movie was as good.
3160;This has wonderful songs, a few are a bit dated , but overall.
3161;ray version is absolutely breathtakingly sharp and high res.
3162;Well this may be one of the few reviews you will read from a man concerning this video.
3163;I grew up in a household full of girls and I was the only boy.
3164;One of the favorites of my sisters was this movie 'The Sound of Music'.
3165;I find myself a father and living in a household full of girls.
3166;And of course every dad wants their little kids to be happy.
3167;I remembered how much my little sisters loved and lived this movie when we were little.

3183;One of her (and my) favorite movies!

3189;The Austrian scenery looked beautiful and the colors stood out.
3190;The Sound of Music is even better sounding than before.
3191;You still get a classic movie chock full of rich and flavorful Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, a winesome performance by the great Julie Andrews, a happy ending and breaktaking shots of Austria.
3192;This one of the oldest shows I've ever seen, and the most musical.
3193;Then everyday I put on the video, and enjoyed it on until I was six, and I still like it now.
3194;Classic film, catchy songs, incredible acting and choreography, and a relatable story.
3195;Watching this movie again was a real treat.
3196;I loved watching the interviews of the child actors as adults.

3198;The acting and singing were great.
3199;It also has some great extras to view.
3200;I received my copy to The Sound Of Music quickly and in great shape.
3201;Love that movie, love that music, and Amazon has made me happy!
3202;When I saw the anniversary edition I thought I should have it but I was not sure if I was going to enjoy it as I used to do.
3203;Not only the movie by itself but the presentation is touching.
3204;The set is beautifully put together, and the extras are really well made .
3205;which is good because sometimes we pay a lot of money for cheaply.
3206;The sound and picture were great and I hope I will not have any more problems in the future
3207;The Bovidae actually believe they can solve or escape the world's ills with some songs and dances.
3208;"pregnancy rate soared, amidst promises of Rolf's ""I'll take care of you"" mantra."
3209;All of the Nazi/Brownshirt 'incompetence' was, in fact, a clever ruse to capture the entire family alone in the woods.
3210;here, in America, 26 years later, it was hailed as a masterpiece with endless kudos and awards.
3211;The restored picture and sound makes it a whole new experience.
3212;the whole family enjoyed it.
3213;The kids love the music box that came with it.
3214;The books and extra materials are amazing too.
3215;Funny, charming, poignant, and well.
3216;acted, this is one of the best musicals of all time.
3217;To see the beautiful sites and the brillant actors that played in it as they are in the present was a plus for me.
3218;For years I always wondered what they look like now, and if that beautiful country really exists.
3219;Learning the story behind the story helped me to understand it more and appreciate it.
3220;Summary: This gift set was fantastic!
3221;The price was too good to beat for such a great set and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed this classic years ago!I must say, I was at first hesitant when I thought about all the extras that came in the box .
3222;But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to see all the extras!
3223;The books were very interesting and the postcards were such a clever add in!!
3224;I truly recommend this gift set to anyone interested or hesitant upon purchasing!
3225;She goes to the hills when she needs to communicate with Satan, but as a nun her peers think she is going so she can communicate with God.
3226;It is the most creative musical ever made.
3227;"The haunting overtones of ""Do Re Mi"" and ""Climb Every Mountain"" will make your skin crawl, as do the performances of the entire cast , which is chillingly and thrillingly led by ""Oscar"" winner Julia Van Drews in the lead role as Maria Von Trapped."
3228;An excellent sweet catchy movie.
3229;Great for the family, and a true story, what more could you want?
3230;I don't usually write reviews but this one truly deserves one.
3231;ray as this film has.
3232;My hats off to the team that gave justice to such a classic film.
3233;Shot in Panavision 70, the glorious vistas of the Alps and Austrian countryside are breathtakingly captured.
3234;"From her introduction, twirling about the tip of a hillside, to her whimsical ""My Favorite Things"" Ms. Andrews is one of the cinema's great guilty pleasures, a wholesome, smart and funloving girl next door that anyone would be happy to have as either their mother or girlfriend ."
3235;There is considerable digital noise in the backgrounds, some color smearing and a bit of edge enhancement and fine detail shimmering to contend with.
3236;Though it doesn't necessarily distract, it is present throughout and does draw attention to itself, particularly if you are viewing the film on a screen 32 inches or greater.
3237;The soundtrack has been nicely restored though at moments it can have a strident sonic characteristic that is slightly grating.
3238;Still, no one can deny that the hills will continue to be alive with the sounds of music for many, many years to come.
3239;"A true classic, incorporating so many values, beautiful scenery, historic reference, music
I:18730;3240;The Sound of Music is a beautiful film.
I:18730;3241;Although made in the 1960s about a family in the 1940s, it holds up well.

I:18730;3244;I know that this is a classic, but I'm sorry.

I:18730;3246;But a woman whirling around on a mountain top.
I:18730;3247;The music, the optimism and the theme of the importance of family.
I:18730;3248;I was smiling and singing as I watched this movie.
I:18730;3249;I even found the ending suspenseful.
I:18730;3250;One of the best musical films of all time.
I:18730;3251;The Sound of Music may have been the greatest Musical of the twentieth century.
I:18730;3252;And, some of the songs have become classics that are still heard as separate songs in serious musical vocal performances.
I:18730;3253;The nun enjoys singing and starts to teach the children some songs.
I:18730;3254;The movie does have a good ending.
I:18730;3255;during the movie, we are treated to several very excellent songs and very good performances.
I:18730;3256;This was Julie Andrews second magnificent movie in a row.
I:18730;3257;To this day, there are very magical moments in this film.
I:18730;3258;This is and always will be a great, GREAT musical.
I:18730;3259;There's a live performance coming to television this season of this film"
3260;i'm sure I will enjoy it in a surrounding more like the theatrical presentation.
3261;This is the perfect family movie.
3262;taking footage of the beautiful Bavarian Mountains.
3263;Overall, Julie Andrews is the best!!
3264;The Sound of Music is probably the greatest musical film ever made.

I:18730;3350;I watched the newer version with Carrie Underwood and although they did a great job I still prefer the original.
I:18730;3351;The music is superb and easy to remember.
I:18730;3352;This is a timeless movie and will be remember long after I am gone.
I:18730;3353;Thank you Amazon keep up the good work, the item was not for me but made a special young friend of mine very happy !
I:18730;3354;I've seen some really good film restorations, but this one was truly breathtaking.
I:18730;3355;The difference was noticeable as soon as the film started and the camera panned over the beautiful views of Austria's mountain side.
I:18730;3356;In any case, I could hear the full depth and complexity on my surround sound.
I:18730;3357;The clarity and crispness made the movie look like something that had been filmed in more recent years.
I:18730;3358;The restoration is just perfect.
I:18730;3359;i'm not sure what was done, but it's perfect.

I:18730;3361;The movie is a treasure and has been given the treatment it deserved to preserve it.

3367;it was great fun to see the children all grown up.
3368;And the section where Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminisce is priceless.
3369;This has always been a favorite and the extras in this edition have me hooked more than ever!
3370;Its become fashionable to make fun of this musical, but the truth is that its still a great movie, great music, and uplifting message.
3371;Love, tragedy, drama, suspense, a daring escape over the Alps and joy.
3372;Although I see yearly on tv, it is still fresh and it is true record of the Von Trapp family during the occupation of Austria.
3373;It is complete with everything detailed that is in the box.
3374;My wife and I loved it and so did our three young grandchildren.
3375;Looks decent on a big screen that it wasn't designed for, with enough extras to allow one to explore something you think you know well in ways you couldn't imagine.
3376;I told my friend that there were thousands of movies to choose from and perhaps we should find something else.
3377;Not true with Julie Andrews and this masterpiece.
3378;I remember laughing and even shedding some tears.
3379;We always exchange gifts and more than often she'll send a great looking sweater or some sort of gadget from the Sharper Image.
3380;I started to cry when I opened the inside box and found this beautifully packaged copy of the 40th Anniversary Edition of The Sound Of Music.
3381;I totally understood and we agreed to watch it the following Saturday night.
3382;Just like years ago, when I decided to watch The Sound Of Music on my own, I decided to revisit that wonderful experience and watch The Sound Of Music (40th Anniversary Edition) on my own.
3383;"Because the movie was so incredible on my large television, and I knew I wanted to write an honest review, I thought it best to watch it again on my 27"" television."
3384;with both TV's, I felt transported to a wonderful place and I enjoyed The Sound Of Music like never before.
3385;The sound was powerful and the clarity was much better than any other version I'd listened to.
3386;this was a gift that I will treasure forever.
3387;i just wanted to thank my friend for introducing me to a part of Americana that is a legend as well.
3388;I feel like watching the movie, again tonight, as it literaly lifts my spirits up high.
3389;thanks for taking the time to read my review.
3390;I really hope that at least a portion of it was helpful to you.
3391;It's also a breath of fresh air to see the child actors .
3392;the Sound Of Music was made with the intention to touch people and it shows in the original film.
3393;Political themes are simplified, but interesting.
3394;clean for the young ones.
3395;I have seen this movie at least more than 10 times and I alwayswant to see it again.
3396;I chose this rating because I love this movie and to be able to be on the road and watch it while husband is driving is wonderful.
3397;this is one of my favorite movies of all times.
3398;And have always liked the charactuers.
3399;The Austrian backdrop is pleasant.
3400;I very much like the songs in the movie.
3401;this viewing made me happy I now have a high resolution widescreen TV and an excellent sound system.
3402;the most amazing moment was at the beginning of the church wedding.
3403;But yet the extreme bass was perfectly controlled and clear, with no distortion.
3404;ray set earns the highest possible rating for pure enjoyment.
3405;Great musical, stars, songs and scenery.
3406;One of my favorites and my 4 and 5 year old grand children enjoyed it as well.
3407;This is my all time favorite classics.
3408;Mow I bought it to be played again and again.
3409;The Sound of Music, a true story based on a true family that became most popular family films of all time.
3410;Will Maria be able to capture the hearts of the children, and the Captain, maybe?
3411;time favotite movie, featuring best.
3412;loved songs and sweet emotions.
3413;The perfect movie that every family should share!
3414;This is a classic and one of my favorites!I'm glad I was able to get the 40th Anniversary Special Edition, to make it that much more memerable!
3415;This one is not only a classic but it is a class act and one of my favorites.
3416;Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history.
3417;Julie Andrews takes her Mary Poppins success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin made her own on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could.
3418;The locales are breathtaking as well (esp.
3419;This is the 40th anniversary edition, and a 2.
3420;It's a classic that never gets old, and I highly recommend this anniversary edition.
3421;I thought this was great when I saw it many years ago and got a recent craving for a second go.
3422;The Sound Of Music is both loved and reviled by critics and fans alike.
3423;Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness.
3424;The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a nave charm.
3425;Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron.
3426;The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities.
3427;The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise.
3428;This is my first experience to order things on line.
3429;It puts me in another world just watching it.
3430;I have always loved The Sound of Music.
3431;i first saw this movie when I was in 5th grade, and I know all of the songs, and it always cheers me up.
3432;It is my favorite musical, and Ioved how Julie and Christopher had such a great chemistry (the Laendler dance is very romantic) I would recommend this to EVERYBODY!
3433;The colors and sounds put you right on the hills singing and dancing with Maria.
3434;I love black and white movies.
3435;This edition of the Sound of Music really brings this classic movie to life!!
3436;The anniversary edition also has several keep sakes that are sure to delight any Sound of Music fan.
3437;Now that I'm older, it was a delight to revisit this classic and see the movie as an adult.
3438;There is a lot of depth to the characters that I didn't see before!
3439;The cinematography in this movie is brilliant and features so much detail in sets and fabrics that simply could not be seen in VHS.
3440;Loved this video since I was a kid.
3441;The nuns at our school took us to see it for a field trip when it was first released.
3442;Watch it all the time.
3443;Good value for a classic movie that should be in everyone's collection.
3444;I always liked this movie because of the beautiful music and scenery and now I like it even more because they've included a documentary movie of the real story with real people.
3445;The Sound of Music is one of my all time favorie movies because of its universal appeal.
3446;If you are an admierer of good music, great classic movies, musicals, amazing performers like Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, outdoors, travel, or history or just want to watch an enjoyable movie, this is the movie for you.
3447;1965: Julie Andrews once again captures audiences in a musical film.
3448;The previous year, 1964, she won the Oscar for Best Actress in Mary Poppins.
3449;"the ""nanny"" or governess role seems to fit Julie Andrews perfectly."
3450;She sings her way to the children's hearts and wins the hand of their father, the uptight, repressed captain.
3451;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer have genuine chemistry on the screen.
3452;"The songs are greatfrom this musical, which had in fact been a Broadway musical by Rogers and Hammersteins (this film, in fact, was a descendant of ""The King and I"" with a similar governess/master theme."
3453;"My Favorite Things, ""I have confidence"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", ""Do."
3454;This classic film is worth the money.
3455;So many wonderful special features!
3456;It is a great movie, and you probably already have it.
3457;An ageless wonder with hours of extras.
3458;Thanks Amazon for great price, both for movie and shipping(free).
3459;This is a wonderful film that is beautifuly directed and produced.
3460;The acting is increadable and the music is wonderful.
3461;Me and wife have enjoyed this film since childhood and bought the blu.
3462;ray version to share this experince with our children.
3463;It's still a great movie, after so many years.
3464;Funny, tender and quite a master piece.
3465;As a protagonist Maria is a bit too passive and agreeable for my taste but for the most part a feel good movie for the whole family and to watch with mom.
3466;This film is, after all, the Sound of Music!
3467;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer take the screen on one of their best performances in this memorable classic!
3468;And the things it comes with are great for those who would want them (the music box for example).
3469;Excellent movie, excellent comboThe version in Blu.
3470;have a lot of additional material.
3471;What an incredible viewing experience.
3472;On the initial opening scenes of the helicopter flyover of the Alps all I was hearing was wow, amazing, incredible coming from the viewers in the room.
3473;It truly was a joy to watch and had the feel of a new movie.
3474;One of the best to watch with the family and to have your friends over to view this movie also
3475;"The ""Sound of Music"" is still an outstanding movie and fits the BD."
3476;The other two discs worked fine.
3477;I bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it.
3478;Came in on time, nice packaging.
3479;This is a great family movie make from the real life story of the Van Trapp family about the time of the being of WWll.
3480;Bonus disc has bio on the real family.
3481;Still great and now our kids (7, 5 and 3) have enjoyed it too.
3482;ish movies), give it a try.
3483;THE SOUND OF MUSIC is truly a masterpiece.
3484;It's my favorite musical of all time, and one of the best love stories ever told, too.
3485;But Maria ends up winning over the affection of the children by her singing and caring.
3486;And, eventually, ends up winning over the stern captain's love .
3487;That is when the real adventure and excitement of the film begins.
3488;Every household should at least have one copy of this truly treasured classic musical.
3489;Probably the best musical that ever was.
3490;All of the actors are superb in this film, and the music is just enchanting.
3491;One viewing of this film and you will remember it (especially the music) for years to come.
3492;tape version), and will continue to watch it.
3493;I grew up watching this movie, and learned most of the songs by heart.
3494;This is one movie that I will always treasure, and I'm thrilled to have it in my collection, so I can watch it over and over.
3495;The breathtaking Alps, lakes and grassy slopes welcome you into the charming land of Austria.
3496;The wide open spaces give an instant sense of freedom.
3497;Suddenly you will see a grassy slope and Maria (Julie Andrews) bursts onto the screen with her childlike joy and sweet innocent nature.
3498;She's always late for everything except for every meal.
3499;"Her Mother Superior sets her free to follow her heart by helping her to see the need to accept a position of Governess to ""seven"" children."
3500;You have to live the life you were born to live.
3501;Laughter is in every scene and singing is the focus.
3502;So the stage is set for humor, love, happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, deceit, romance and adventure.
3503;The chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reaches its height in a beautiful Austrian folk dance.
3504;in the first half of the movie, life is pleasant and follows an upbeat theme.
3505;Happiness can sometimes make you cry as well.
3506;You can literally feel the invincible human spirit rising in you as you celebrate the family's daring flight from Nazi rule.
3507;Julie Andrews voice is magical.
3508;If you appreciate impeccable acting, breathtaking scenery, and a feeling of true romance.
3509;call me sentimental, but you will love this movie.
3510;I guess I still have the child in me that wants to believe in a fairy tale, yet this was based on a true story, and perhaps real life is the best story of all.
3511;This is my second favorite musical after Annie.
3512;The music is great for all ages, a great movie for little ones but you can still enjoy it at age 50.
3513;She is the one who wins over the children and their father with her warmth and her wonderful songs.
3514;It truly is one of the best musicals ever made.
3515;This version is a perfect upgrade for my collection.
3516;Some of the same old goodies and new special features to love!
3517;Am excited about this movie.
3518;one of my very favorite classic movies.
3519;Amazon has always been an easy and great way to do my shopping.
3520;My kids loved this item.
3521;My daughters loved the movie because of all the music and the kids.
3522;They also loved the music box that came with the kit.
3523;Hell, I liked the movie also, The vivid colors and the sound are great.
3524;Nice digital reproduction of this all time favorite.
3525;We just watched it and was still so impressed, as we were oh so many years ago when it 1st took stage in our local theater .
3526;ray's color is so live and beautiful.
3527;The surround sound is so good.
3528;Probably the most beloved musical of all time.
3529;That Maria is so wise.
3530;Brings back may childage memories when I saw the original many times on a theatre screen and in a broadway play.
3531;Bought the movie for my Granddaughter because she loves this movie and watches it very often and I am from Austria
3532;The items included in the box set helped me to appreciate the history and the making of the film.
3533;I would recommend the box set edition of The Sound of Music to anyone and everyone.
3534;Julie Andrews definately fits the part in this movie.
3535;It was in great condition as described.
3536;The extra features were intriguing to me.
3537;Great product, shipped on time.
3538;Julie Andrews is the best!
3539;Great gift for a child that likes to sing or any child.
3540;Children are so inundated with material that isn't appropriate, this is wholesome family fun.
3541;The sound of music is just wonderful to have as a part of your movie collection.
3542;I thought this MTV generation may have rejected it, but my 11 year old daughter absolutely loves it.
3543;One of the best movies ever.
3544;Even though it is an old move, they loved it also.
3545;Great story, acting and music.
3546;She is happy with and it so are we.
3547;Terrific film to begin with.
3548;Lots of extras of behind the scenes, making of, cast interviews, etc.
3549;Well worth the cost even if you already own it.
3550;A special edition of a favorite movie for a gift.
3551;It has the special features to enhance the gift.
3552;In Hollywood, it's held in at least a grudging esteem.
3553;But SoM also represents a very high level of film craft .
3554;the screenplay by Ernest Lehman is first rate.
3555;You really should subject yourself to the stage play some time to see how much he improved on the source material.
3556;In the movie, it's that spectacular puppet show.
3557;Plus it underlines how close Maria and the children have become (especially to the Baroness!)
3558;"Then there is a sequence that makes up maybe 20% of the film that begins with ""My Favorite Things"" and ends with the spectacular ""Do."
3559;Yet it vividly chronicles the transition in the relationship between Maria and the children as she goes from enemy number one, to beloved surrogate mother.
3560;While both songs were in the Broadway show, neither one moved the story forward in this way.
3561;"mi builds on the cutting from one location to another pioneered in Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's ""On the Town"" (specifically the New York, New York number)."
3562;But it does it so much better.
3563;"The scenes are carefully choreographed so they edit together smoothly
I:18730;3564;This is a musical that takes advantage of everything film can do well, such as collapse time and space so a single song (Do.
I:18730;3565;mi) shows us weeks in the lives of these characters.
I:18730;3566;Interestingly, his performance looks better every time I see it.
I:18730;3567;Something Good has never really appealed to me.
I:18730;3568;To those people I recommend two films .
I:18730;3569;Some stories can be improved on film.
I:18730;3570;I ordered the disc twice (my wife's favorite movie), the first time, when it didn't play, amazon said to ruturn it and that the new one they will resend me would be fine.
I:18730;3571;This copy is fantastic in Blu.
I:18730;3572;ray and loved reliving that moment from long, long ago in the comfort of our family room!
I:18730;3573;As far as the film goes, the finest ever.
I:18730;3574;But without a doubt the opening helicopter shot is the best in any film.
I:18730;3575;So amazing to see that helicopter descend upon Julie twirling it just makes my heart leap everytime I see it.
I:18730;3576;This is a great musical, with excellent acting and beautiful and memorable songs that remain in your mind forever.
I:18730;3577;This is a great movie for a writer to study and learn from, because it is well plotted, with good characters and wonderful music.
I:18730;3578;the beauty of folk music (Kindle).
I:18730;3579;This release gets five stars because the film itself is so good, and the transfer is gorgeous.
I:18730;3580;The Sound of Music has never looked so good on video.
I:18730;3581;The Biography Channel piece on the Trapp Family Singers is missing, but there are two new archival extras: one with Mary Martin and the other, """"The Sound of Movies,"""" which used to be a separate release."""
3582;It's a gimmick, and not a very good or well.
3583;and I can truly say, it was worth the wait.
3584;the colors, details and clarity are amazing.
3585;Just watch the scenes of Do.
3586;the details in the church are stunning.
3587;every detail from the carpet to the candles and gold backgrounds just stand out perfectly.
3588;for all those that think only new movies can look good on blu.
3589;run right now and pick it up.you will be glad you did.
3590;Plus it is a love story if it does take time getting there.
3591;But it is a film you must have if not for the music then the visuals.
3592;I grew up watching this and now i share it with my family and all my friends
3593;Fantastic reprduction on the Blue ray.
3594;what can I say, it is a classic movie that will never go out of style.
3595;Andrews is marvelous as always
3596;This is a wonderful movie portraying the life of the von Trapp family during WWII.
3597;The sound and visuals are stunning and the extra disc is packed full of great information.
3598;The extra disc also includes a marvelous back.
3599;story behind the production of the movie as well as the story of the real von Trapp family.
3600;We also enjoyed the 2nd disk with the background info about the actors, actresses, production, etc.
3601;The SOUND OF MUSIC is one of the best movies ever made and once you have performed in the stage version (which isn't as good as the film) you will love it forever.
3602;i recommend anyone to see this
3603;This movie is a classic, but.
3604;it comes alive in Blu.
3605;Loved this movie all over again.
3606;We loved watching this version.
3607;All the scenes I remember from years ago were included, unlike the edited, chopped.
3608;Watched little bit and looks good.
3609;But I think it is in good condition.
3610;I bought this as a present for my wife.
3611;She is absolutely rapt with it, especially the additional included goodies (postcards and particularly the music box).
3612;My wife and I really enjoyed this movie growing up.
3613;Now my 8 yr old daughter is a fan.
3614;Certainly a time piece based on its setting, but it still delivers good wholesome fun.
3615;I highly recommend this version and 3.
3616;Now I got my daughter into it and she loves it too!!
3617;She absolutely loves it and of course I enjoy it too!!
3618;The first time i saw this film, I was delighted by the music and it's haunting lyrics escpecially of 'The Sound of Music'.
3619;It was my eldest sister who introduced me to this magically made movie and perhaps one of the best musical movie genres ever made.
3620;One could easily fall in love with the music and lyrics of Rodgers and Hammerstein!
3621;Christopher Plummer is dashing and handsome in this film and possessed a cool and calm voice.
3622;have entertainment collection for the whole family for a truly 100% family entertainment.
3623;I recommend this to everyone!
3624;Like the other reviews, the breath taking scenery, songs, story, and Julie are tops!
3625;"what's nice about the R&H
I:18730;3626;Excellent sound rendition and gorgeous scenes and photography for a 40 year old production.
I:18730;3627;The anniversary edition also included trailers, special features, interviews on a second disk which brought production tidbits and information that was fascinating as well.
I:18730;3628;The best example of Hollywood getting it right.
I:18730;3629;The magic of great cinematography.
I:18730;3630;Director Robert Wise wowed film goers with great opening shots of New York skyscrapers in """"West Side Story,"""" but went one step further in """"The Sound of Music"""" with its lush mountain beauty."""
3631;Julie Andrews spinning on top of a mountain peak singing the title song makes for great moments in filmdom.
3632;one of the most family friendly movies of all.
3633;time, each viewing takes us back to a time of innocence in our lives.
3634;I find myself wanting to wave goodnight to them as well.
3635;"Sweet and tender, this film melts the heart of even the most ""manly of men."""
3636;This is for the true Sound of Music fan.
3637;I love all of contents, as you can see, in the description.
3638;A must have for the true Sound of Music fan.
3639;ray edition is over, and it's absolutely captivating.
3640;It's all rendered masterfully in this release.
3641;You will see sumptuous details in the clothing, the paintings, the wallpaper, the stonework that you may never have noticed before in the dreamier but muddier versions all awash in pink and pale green.
3642;The soundtrack is lively and vibrant as others have noted.
3643;I love it and highly reccomend.
3644;It is also a great value.
3645;They really did a nice job, especially on the opening sequence.
3646;there is a nice sing.
3647;I found this product to be excellent in shape and nature.
3648;Still one of the best musicals ever.
3649;It was wonderful to see the original cast come together on Oprah.
3650;Where else can you hear such terrific music?
3651;She has added it to her Favorite Movie list.
3652;This musical takes place during the golden times just prior to WWII.
3653;Great movie, great acting, and fun to watch.
3654;I was so pleased to finally see this movie fully restored to pristine condition.
3655;wow, they came SO CLOSE to perfection.
3656;still, an amazing set and the picture is stunning.
3657;"If ""West Side Story"" was the best musical film of the sixties, then ""The Sound of Music,"" adapted from the long."
3658;running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular.
3659;with a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti.
3660;and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story.
3661;"teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, ""The Sound of Music"" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones."
3662;"there are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo."
3663;"mi,"" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry."
3664;"And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, ""Edelweiss,"" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and Hammerstein."
3665;confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self.
3666;It works to balance the tight.
3667;"lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the ""adorable"" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness."
3668;I've always been a big fan of Julie A., and this movie is just great.
3669;I loved to sing the songs when I was a little kid.
3670;This should be required viewing to see what a real love story is all about.
3671;Robert Wise was a good pick to direct this musical.
3672;Decades ago the young Orson Welles was in need of an editor for Citizen Kane (1941), and Robert Wise helped put that movie on the map.
3673;Wise, who also produced the musical, won his second Best Director Oscar and the Best Picture Oscar.
3674;We knew Robert Wise could do a great job with musicals after West Side Story.
3675;Julie Andrews was a great pick for Maria.
3676;ray edition is fantastic in every way.
3677;There are already some terrific reviews posted on this title .
3678;I have always loved this movie as well and in the past had enjoyed it mostly during TV presentations and once on an old laserdisc.
3679;I was also surprised to see a few extra scenes which I did not recall .
3680;likely these are usually cut by the networks for TV showings so that was an unexpected treat.
3681;I feel this truly is the definitive edition of this wonderful film and I couldn't be happier that I had the chance to share it with my kids (and wife and in.
3682;I have not had time to check out the extras yet but they look terrific as well.
3683;ray player and love musical theatre, you really must own this film.
3684;Excellent movie musical with Julie Andrews as the headliner.
3685;"I first saw this movie when it premiered in ""Cineramascope"" on the cinerama sceen, and it is the most memorable movie of that fad era, because that is the way it was meant to be viewed, and should be watched."
3686;I am so glad home theater sceens are accomodating those vibrant additives to give todays audience a chance to see how some of these movies worked.
3687;"It was absolutely incredible to recall the giant size visions of the convent interiors, and deluxe ""mountainous"" scenery."
3688;The sights of seeing our beloved Julie dance, hop, skip, and jump throughout the movie with seven, (yes, seven), children next to her heels is a must see.
3689;I am not much of a complainer for intricate drivel or criticism, as long as the general feel of the movie produced is well worth the size of entertainment it gives in no uncertain terms.
3690;on another note, the available soundtrack to The Sound Of Music is pretty much a necessity if one is to grasp the stereo scope of the music output.
3691;It gives another dimension to relate to the magnificence of this feature.
3692;time classic comes to life for my kids at Christmas .
3693;wonderful scenery and amazing music .
3694;the kids were singing right along with it.
3695;Thank you for making this available, it is a great movie and a wonderful addition to our collection.
3696;Quite possibly the very musical ever, and still very , uch alive today.
3697;I still love this, even after seeingbit a hundred times.
3698;What more can one say about one of the more, perhaps the most beloved, of American family films?It's hard to believe this is the 45th Anniversary Edition, now in Blu.
3699;what makes this a perfect film is that it is a journey of a real.
3700;"And the other thing that works so well is that even though it might be labeled a ""musical,"" all the music is internally derived from performances within the story by a family whose job it is to sing."
3701;Not bad for those who hate contrived singing and dancing!On top of all this, besides the perfect story, casting and direction (Robert Wise at the peak of his powers), it includes a love story (really a double love story) and a harrowing journey over the Alps .
3702;on their journey to freedom.
3703;julie Andrews is almost incandescent as Maria, the spirited young woman who brings love and music to the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children.
3704;It is a good story and anyone who likes musicals should see it.
3705;Also the extras you get are great.
3706;The box it all comes in is beautiful.
3707;A movie I first saw when I was 16, and it still is worth the time to watch.
3708;Though only very lightly based on the true story, it is entertaining, funny, and serious when need be, as it happened in a time when madmen ruled.
3709;"Sure, it won an Oscar for Best Picture, but it's also one of the only movies to accomplish that feat and yet not receive a screenplay nomination (""Titanic"" was another, go figure)."
3710;Is this sophisticated, provocative filmmaking?
3711;"who cares?There are, no doubt, many ""greater"" films, but I doubt that even the best of them are as durable, as endlessly enjoyable as this one."
3712;I've memorized every frame since I was six and it still leaves me spellbound each time I see it, and that's a claim to fame only a full.
3713;From that first stunning sweep over the Austrian landscape to the rapturously uplifting final shot of the Von Trapps crossing the Alps (if you don't consider that emotionally resonant, I suggest you check your pulse), this is an unparalleled entertainment.
3714;i ask you, are there any songs as delightfully hummable as the ones here?
3715;A hundred years from now, by which time the medium will probably have altered beyond recognition, it'll still feel like a classic.
3716;The day they thought of this film was a day to remember.
3717;a treasure to have in anyone's music library.
3718;Even after all this time, the Sound of Music still captivates.
3719;This is a great, classic musical.
3720;I bought this for my mom and she loved it.
3721;Looks very nice and looks like I spent a lot more than I actually did.
3722;I enjoy it and I will watch it many more times.
3723;They just love the music.
3724;My Favorite Things I love the Story but I love all the old Musical's and I have alot of them from Meet me in St. Louie to Mary Poppins and the King and I.
3725;The price was great too Thank You.
3726;I highly recommend this film.
3727;Fantastic film and the extras were marvelous.
3728;Blu ray is so lifelike.
3729;It's one of the most beautiful scenes in cinematic history.
3730;"This movie is first rate and first class
I:18730;3731;Maria, you have a great capacity for love.
I:18730;3732;The Sound of Music is a wonderful, classic movie and I love the history that's blended into the story as well.
I:18730;3733;i dont mind this because i have watched this movie ever since i was a kid and i will continue watching it.
I:18730;3734;The arrival and packaging made my inner fangirl squeal in delight.
I:18730;3735;the letter was very nice too.
I:18730;3736;Absolutely a classic and always a joy to watch.
I:18730;3737;A wonderful adventure that takes in beautiful scenery, outstanding casting, and one of the best musicals my wife and I have ever watched!!
I:18730;3738;The children are wooden at times, but the score soars above nearly everyone's heads, and set in the stunning Swiss Alps, and in Salzburg, Austria, which has to be one of the most picturesque towns in the world, each musical number transports the viewer to a place of joy .
I:18730;3739;The opening sequence, often satirized, remains one of the most technically sophisticated and creative series of shots ever put on film.
I:18730;3740;old excitement deep in my soul, and then .
I:18730;3741;you are on the expertly crafted emotional ride that is The Sound of Music.
I:18730;3742;Christopher Plummer deserves special mention .
I:18730;3743;he is the one performer in this movie who delivers a subtle, heartbreakingly real performance, and he is without a doubt the most dashing Capt. Von Trapp ever.
I:18730;3744;I've loved this movie since it was originally released.
I:18730;3745;ray copy is extraordinary and you will not be disappointed with it.
I:18730;3746;This is an excellent example of what blu.
I:18730;3747;I consider Sound of Music one of a few all time classics.
I:18730;3748;The Sound Of Music never looked so good.
I:18730;3749;Your family will love it over and over.
I:18730;3750;I have loved this movie since I was a kid and saw it in the theater.
I:18730;3751;Great to see this movie in blue ray.
I:18730;3752;Color and sound are great and vibrant.
I:18730;3753;Recommend to children of all ages.
I:18730;3754;Enjoyed by kids and adults of all ages.
I:18730;3755;I had not see it in awhile but it still holds up as entertaining after all these years.
I:18730;3756;The Sound of Music is, without a question in anyone's mind, the greatest musical ever made.
I:18730;3757;First of all, it was the film that made a star out of Julie Andrews (she does an even better performance as Maria von Trapp than she does as Mary Poppins), 2: It was the 60's when this film was made, a pivotal decade, and a time for such heartwarming, romantic musicals to ease the stress.
I:18730;3758;filled and changing world, and 3: It's unforgettable.
I:18730;3759;From the opening scene in which a spirited Julie Andrews runs across the Austrian hills that overlook the Alps and sings """"The Hills Are Alive"""", we are taken directly into the sweeping tale."""
3760;The songs are catchy and memorable.
3761;The romantic chemistry between Plummer and Andrews, the pseudo romance between the Captain's eldest daughter and the young mailman who later turns Nazi.
3762;This is a perfect family film, as well as a romantic film for a couple.
3763;Simply my most favorite movie of all time.
3764;This movie captures the heart and soul of a person like none ever before or since.
3765;Every emotion that can be exhibited in an individual is touched in this movie.
3766;I've seen it many, many times and each time it gets better and better.
3767;Wow, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3768;It is truly one of my favorites.
3769;If you love a good romantic movie then this is for you.
3770;I usually hate musicals but this one is SOOO good!!
3771;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plumber did an excellent job in this movie.
3772;This is a great movie to watch on a family night.
3773;It's definitely a must see!!
3774;I'm sure I will love it.
3775;The music the dancing the romance.
3776;What can i say, it's a great movie with great music.
3777;We can now enjoy it on all our media outlets for a long time to come.
3778;It has always been one of my favorite movies.
3779;Now I can see it in pristine clarity without being edited for for television and commercial interutption.
3780;If you like musicals, then you'll like this one.
3781;Julie Andrews is perfect in this role.
3782;The music, scenery, and supporting cast is all great.
3783;The Sound of Music is definately one of my favorite musicals and also one of my favorite movie about WWII.
3784;Her performance is truely wonderful.
3785;The other cast members were good actors too.
3786;There are a lot to like about this film.
3787;If you are a big fan of grand scale cinematography this is a great film for you to see.
3788;If you also like musicals this is a must for any fan of the genre.
3789;All in all the film is a timeless classic that every film fan needs to see.
3790;This is an amazing set.
3791;The music box is so cute and the books and postcards are beautiful.
3792;When I saw this on sale I snapped it up.
3793;It's awesome and the deal was good.
3794;Just as good the tenth time as the first.
3795;disk package was a gift and the recipient could not run it.
3796;Amazon made it right and ordered it from another vendor.
3797;It's a great gift for musical lovers!
3798;"The scenery is magnificient and the music will have you ""humming it while you do your daily routine."
3799;The story is very good as it is mostly true.
3800;The overall experience in watching this movie make it truly outstanding.
3801;Reminded just how wonderful and joyful this movie is, and my grandchildren just loved it!
3802;We constantly sing the songs!
3803;And I'm a young lady who was raised with musicals.
3804;But it's my number 1.
3805;Julie Andrews is beautiful in this and I love the scenery and I love the Music.
3806;if you have not seen Sound of Music you are missing out on a great film.
3807;it's a great movie that both you and kids can enjoy together.
3808;I have seen this movie several times and love it each time.
3809;I jumped at it and was I surprised.
3810;I had fast delivery as well!
3811;This is one of the best composed musicals I've ever seen.
3812;It has delighted me my entire life, especially on sick days :)
3813;This is my favorite movie, so I was obviously very pleased.
3814;The best musical ever made.
3815;I was so happy with everything that came in the package and it was in pristine condition.
3816;It was well worth it to keep it and pass it down through the generations.
3817;Her singing and acting are the greatest.
3818;But there will be someone as good.
3819;I grew up with Julie Andrews's movies and I love her.
3820;So in conclusion, Julie is still tops in her version and Carrie Underwood did amazing in her version.
3821;I enjoyed them both as excellent entertainment.
3822;Live you have one take and that is it, Movies you have take, after take, after take too get it right.
3823;The Sound of Music is one of the greatest musicals of all time!
3824;The songs are absolutely phenomenal and the story line exceptional.
3825;we had an itch to watch this old time favorite and it worked out great.
3826;found it quickly and watched it right then!
3827;Great movie, great case, great music.
3828;I enjoy watching it over and over.
3829;An excellent job was done for both video and audio.
3830;Highly recommended for any fan of this movie.
3831;It was great to watch again,
3832;The commentaries as well as the interviews with the original cast is fabulous!
3833;which I even enjoy more since viewing the bonus materials about the making of the movie, interviews with the cast, etc.
3834;My 4, 12, and 15 old boys love this movie!
3835;Julie Andrews is an absolute delight as Maria.
3836;I enjoy the music and the movie brings nostalgia.
3837;A wonderful movie for musical fans.
3838;A classic for all time.
3839;This was a great collection of the Sound of Music!
3840;That was my favorite movie in my childhood and I still love to see it!
3841;Both adults and children love to watch it over and over again.
3842;This is the best family movie of all time!!!!!!!
3843;You can cry, sing, and laugh all at the same time.
3844;It's one of those movies that you want to see over and over.
3845;It was charming and well done.
3846;Christopher Plummer is magnificent as the patriarch widower Baron VonTrapp who eventually finds love for Maria played by Julie Andrews, a young nun who is asked to be a governess for his children.
3847;What a wonderful classic, that was beautifully restored.
3848;That made the movie doubly enjoyable.
3849;Watch it with family and you will hear people singing the songs for the next few days.
3850;Now much older and wiser, those classics make my stomach roll when they come on.
3851;i bought this for my loving wife's as part of our one year anniversary.
3852;Not to mention the joy I received for being such a thoughtful and loving husband!I sat through it, watching it with her.
3853;I've always loved the movie, but the interview with the grown up kids was especially interesting.
3854;Watch the interviews first and then the movie.
3855;You'll see it through new eyes.
3856;The entire family enjoyed this movie in the car during Holiday travels.
3857;Wonderful family movie that led us to discuss WWII.
3858;This was a family favorite growing up.
3859;Kids love it too, good thing this is not a VHS tape, the amount of times the kids have watched it the tape would have been worn through.
3860;This is a really nice version of a classic I've enjoyed for over 30 years.
3861;The colors and the music are wonderful on this disc.
3862;Amazon replaced the set at no cost (really great service there!)
3863;Again I thought the treatment of the problem by Amazon was outstanding.
3864;This set is a wonderful reminder of a classic movie.
3865;Beautifully done and lots of extras.
3866;The Sound of Music is an awesome movie that you will want to watch over and over again.
3867;this is the story of Maria, an adorable young woman who lives in a school for nuns but often finds herself overwhelmed by her love of music and life in general (given the beauty of the surrounding area, the hills, the river, that is quite easy to do).
3868;Captain Von Trapp (portrayed by Christopher Plummer) is a very disciplined man to the point of being militaristic with his children and his ways soon clash with the more loving and affectionate nature of Maria.
3869;And if you don't, then you should definitely watch it.
3870;ray treatment is one of the best I have seen.
3871;Lots of special features, interactive modes, extra features which will please any fan.
3872;Thanks alot I will enjoy this for sure!
3873;I had forgotten how great this movie is and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.
3874;It was a present for my mom she was very excited about when it came.
3875;Since I was a small child, I have loved the Sound of Music.
3876;It is a delightful and entertaining movie.
3877;It is unquestionably my favorite movie.
3878;The music stays with you and uplifts your spirits.
3879;The love story between the Captain and Maria is breath.
3880;The dance scene always makes my heart beat faster.
3881;Determination and the human spirit are the forces behind this movie.
3882;I liked the combo pack because we have both Blue.
3883;So we can watch it were ever we are.
3884;We love the Sound of Music and watch it frequently.
3885;I finally got rid of my VHS movies with the intent to replace my faves with Blu Ray when Amazon brought out this special set.
3886;It is a fantastic collectors set.
3887;It is wonderful hearing Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and the other cast members sing the songs, and seeing them play their roles after so many years.
3888;There was on part where the movie skipped i didnt see any scratches on the disc but the kids enjoyed the movie
3889;Loved it when I was growing up and love it now.

3899;Love this movie, and tape was in great condition.
3900;I remember liking the songs (Do.
3901;20 years later I sat down to watch Julie Andrews sing about the hills being alive and a few of her favorite things, and I was riveted from start to finish.
3902;What is at the heart of this film is the power of music and how it can save a life and awaken the soul.
3903;up until Maria's arrival at the Von Trapp household (or should I say mansion, the place is huge!)
3904;Maria's entrance into the household brings tenderness and the showing of love back into the home.
3905;as a viewer you bare witness to the evolvement of a man and his family who are captivated by sweet Maria, and the flourishing of a love between a man and a woman.
3906;The film is truly lovely, and the Blu.
3907;It's a timeless classic !!!
3908;Just wonderful to watch !!
3909;I have been enjoying it numerous times since my high school years.
3910;One of the most beautiful, romantic love scenes that gives me goosebumps is when Maria and the captain are out in the garden declaring their love for each other.
3911;The scenery, the music, everything in this movie is gorgeous.
3912;It is one of the best musical ever put on film.
3913;My children loved it when they were young.
3914;it will never die in the hearts of the people!
3915;Just as great as it was when I first saw it many many years ago.
3916;The film has NEVER looked so good or sounded so good.
3917;The commentary was excellent, and I love how it also presents the musical numbers WITHOUT vocals, so you can sing along.
3918;The extras on disc 2 were great too.
3919;I gave it 4 stars simply cause it seems there wasn't enough features, but what's on there is absolutely amazing.
3920;There's the gallery which is filled with photos and information.
3921;now I returned to it and got even more pleasure.
3922;fantastic performance, marvelous music, beautiful locations.
3923;"ray release of ""The Sound of Music"" is the most beautiful edition ever."
3924;All the little extras in the collectors edition are sweet touches too, especially the little book that comes with it.

3940;I enjoyed the story line and I love the songs(and Julie Andrews), but The Sound of Music just doesn't seem as great as some of the other musicals out their(which seems odd since it's based on a true story).
3941;I own the movie and every once in a while I'll watch it with the kids I babysit, but I still don't think it's an amazing movie.
3942;From Anine, and Grease, and Sound of Music, and Fiddeler on the Roof.

3946;scenes and some screen tests and other storyboard stuff, which makes learning about the production of the movie great.
3947;also, some previews too, which is a great walk through history.
3948;all and all, give a wonderful postive gife to any family, this is a great one!Lastly, I am in a review writing competition with some other people, so if you liked this review I would love your Yes vote, I write this review though with sincerity and hope for that the kids in the world will find the positive joy of musicals, before they run into the negative elements waiting to take their minds and money later.
3949;Take care and best wishes!

3985;If you enjoy a movie that is wholesome and entertaining, look no further than The Sound of Music.
3986;It was great seeing this movie after a long time.

3997;The glorious music of Rodgers and Hammerstein have kept this epic landmark of a film in the hearts of three generations, and no doubt still more to come.
3998;But escaping from time to time is fun.

4001;depth look into the creation of one of America's best.
4002;The reunion of the von Trapp children, now in their 40s and 50s (or 60s in the case of Liesl), presents a nostalgic look into an excursion in their past.

4018;known Wise film for review here until I took an informal poll and found that a startling number of friends and business associates on my e. mail distribution list had never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC uncut and non.
4019;mUSIC was first a real.

4023;There is a fun puppet show, which is often cut for time on TV.
4024;"The kids and the Captain all sing the lovely ""Edelweiss"" to the Baroness and show biz manager Max (Richard Haydn)."
4025;i have seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC on stage, and it just dies, despite the wonderful songs and competent actors, because of painted backdrops for the town and Alpine mountain meadows.
4026;By contrast, this Robert Wise movie (scripted by Ernest Lehman) is a masterpiece with dream casting to match the incomparable songs.
4027;"The Baroness realizes that the Captain is in love with Maria and fades into the background
I:18730;4028;The big climax to the movie is a performance of """"So Long, Farewell"""" and """"Edelweiss"""" for a packed audience in a theater that has Nazis taking up the entire first row and guarding the exits."""
4029;But you know this movie has a happy ending, or else it would get booed!
4030;A gripping night graveyard scene leads to an enthralling finale that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.
4031;The movie won five Oscars and was nominated for several more.
4032;The more expensive edition belongs in every family.
4033;production almost day by day for the movie, and what the family has been up to since the movie.
4034;mastered soundtrack and the original widescreen aspect ratio (so you can see all of the children and all of the outdoor scenery at once).
4035;Man, I love this immortal screen classic!
4036;Amazing detail and incredible likeness of actors, sets, costumes, landscapes mountains and terrains.
4037;I wanted to watch it again after viewing the recent live remake which my young daughter enjoyed.
4038;I am very happy to have been able to share that with her.
4039;Awsome color and fantastic music.
4040;This is a beautifully restored version of the movie.
4041;If you love the performance, get it before it disappears.

4051;She loves it and even sits through the whole movie.
4052;Great music, Julie Andrews, heart.
4053;Kids younger than eight may not fully appreciate the story line, as it takes place in Austria in the 1930's, but they'll enjoy the unforgettable songs and the silly antics of the seven Von Trapp children.
4054;It also makes the Nazi movement and WWII very real and immediate, by showing it's impact on one family.
4055;This was a gift for my son's girlfriend.
4056;This is her favorite movie and all the extras brought it to life.
4057;The Sound of Music is great gift for grandchildren!
4058;This movie has intrigue, suspense, romance, and musical entertainment.
4059;You do know how it is going to turn out, so it's not as suspenseful as it could be, but overall, it's a very enjoyable movie.
4060;At the time, it seemed to me a movie of such innocence, and revisiting it as an adult I can appreciate and enjoy it also for the raciness for the times.
4061;"Watching the movie again in great and the special features are well done, especially the ""Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminiscence"" and ""From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion"""
4062;I sang to the music as I drove along.
4063;I bought this right after seeing Carrie Underwood live in the Sound of Music so I could compare them.
4064;I prefer the singing in this one.
4065;Julie Andrews voice is magnificent.
4066;A beautiful musical that is filled with beautiful scenery and a look into what it was like during that time of war and they overcame.
4067;Its a classic that everyone should see!!
4068;"It's as much a ""visit from the past"" for me as it is a new experience for her."
4069;The clarity of both video and audio is very good.
4070;The colors are true to the original (as I remember it!)
4071;I think this will become a family favorite.
4072;"It's a pleasure to be able to have an opportunity to own a copy of such an ""old"" movie."
4073;all of the songs were so beautiful , the scenery was gorgeous, and julie andrews was so likeable.
4074;I remember loving this movie the very first time i saw it at the age of 8 and years later its even better.
4075;The Sound of Music has always been my favorite movie.
4076;Thank you for your quick service.
4077;It arrived promptly and in good condition.
4078;I have loved this movie since I was a kid and now I am so pleased to share it with my own children!!
4079;Julie Andrews is an amazing actress!
4080;High resolution was worth the extea $$$.
4081;Our family loves this classic, true story musical.
4082;This is a beautifully put together collector's set.
4083;I grew up with this movie and have loved it since I was very young.
4084;It's a great find even at regular price though.
4085;Highly recommend it if you're a fan of The Sound of Music.
4086;this is one to keep for years to come.
4087;The movie, postcards and music is great.
4088;My Mom is a Sound of Music fan and she really loved it!!
4089;I loved this so much I bought a second one for my sister.
4090;This is just a beautiful keepsake of one of the all time classics.
4091;but now I understand the reason better.
4092;I have to say, the music writers got away with very little work.
4093;"Before you all say ""everyone remembers ""The hills are alive with the sound of music"" line!"""
4094;The transition of the main characters in the two stories is nearly identical as well, but if you do it right, that's interesting to watch.
4095;There are a couple reasons why I bought this:1.
4096;All the good stuff is on the Blu.
4097;new Hardcover Book The Sound of Music: A Few of our Favorite Things (It was cool learning about the real Von Trapp Family.
4098;"painted ""My Favorite Things"" Music Box."
4099;ray Feature Film and Special Features.
4100;depth Featurettes on the Songs, the Stage Show, the Film Restoration and the Real.
4101;ray, I was plenty satisfied with everything else.
4102;This is a great movie to have as my 1st Blu.
4103;I am a big fan of the movie and got this set for Christmas.
4104;Love this movie, great acting by all and beautiful scenery.
4105;I hadn't seen it for a very long time but really enjoyed it as an adult as well.
4106;Total package is very well put together.
4107;I choose 5 stars because this movie is a timeless classic.
4108;It has the movie and interviews with the stars.
4109;One of the classic musicals.
4110;Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and the rest of the cast makes this a must see for young and old alike.
4111;Ask any film buff what one of their favorite films are and this one always comes near the top.
4112;"Winning multiple Oscars including Best Picture of 1965 ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the best movie musicals of all."
4113;born Christopher Plummer in the role of a naval commander who is the widowed father of seven children, the film is equally known for its beautiful soundtrack and memorable songs.
4114;"Based on the stage play of the same name, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare films that has grossed over a billion dollars since it debut at the boxoffice."
4115;"Both Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer recall the shooting of the film together and perhaps the greatest part about the bonuses is the beautiful reunion of all seven kids now adults discussing their memories on ""The Sound of Music""."
4116;It is wonderful that all seven actors still remain friends to this day.
4117;A film for the entire family.
4118;I was able to download it and view it instantly.
4119;I will definitely use this option again.
4120;One musical I could watch 30.40 more times during my life!
4121;I got my order fast and the movie is perfect!
4122;A great musical for kids of all ages .
4123;Wonderful music you love to sing along to.
4124;"My daughter loves this movie and rewinds it constantly to sing along with the songs over and over again like ""Do, a dear, a female dear."""
4125;I am also a big Julie Andrews fan (not the biggest though, I leave that title open for someone else to take) and have loved her work in Mary Poppins since I was a kid.
4126;It was beautiful to watch and made even better by the extras that were included on the second disc.
4127;By now she must have watched it 20 times and still finds it funny.
4128;And this is from a girl that loves SpongeBob!I hadn't seen the movie for a long time and was able to get more from it with each viewing.
4129;This movie was made in the sixties, we live in the 21st century, GET OVER IT!
4130;I have shared this movie with my children and now with our grandchild (and nephews/nieces).
4131;The kids love the music and always have lots of questions which I use as history lessons.
4132;Musicals are suppose to be uplifting and fluffy.
4133;Every song is a gem.
4134;The musical opens with a beautiful panoramic view of the gorgeous Austrian country side.
4135;From that very moment your spirit is uplifted.
4136;Maria eventually goes to the Von Tapp home and wins over the children.
4137;"One of the best scenes is when she teaches the children to sing by singing ""Do Re Mi"" While seeing this song the children are traveling through the beautiful city of Saltzberg."
4138;The real Von Trapp children protested the way their father was portrayed in this musical.
4139;I get goosebumps every time I hear tis song.
4140;He eventually starts falling love with her.
4141;Maria become uncinfortable and returns to the convent.
4142;Maria returns to the Baron and his children and marries him.
4143;He tells them he is going to the musical festival.
4144;In one marvelous scene he sings Eidelweiss.
4145;He was basically telling the Nazis what they can do with their Third Riech.
4146;And by the looks of their faces in the audience, they knew he was telling them what they can do with Third Reich.
4147;The musical is an american musical treasure and stands as one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest along with Oklahoma!
4148;The music and the script flow into a magnificent movie that has stood the test of time, this movie and it's cast will certainly go down as one of the all time greats
4149;This a type of movie that you can watch again and again and again.
4150;Julie Andrews shows why she's a star in this film.
4151;It is both cute and funny, for all ages I would say.
4152;Maybe you have to be older to sense this theme, but once you realize it is there, the film becomes more rich and compelling.
4153;The whole presentation is wonderful !
4154;the special features disc was enjoyable also.
4155;thanks for offering this beautiful classic.
4156;The book is full of pictures and information about the real Trapp family.
4157;This is great to have I love this movie and play.
4158;This movie is so much better than the movies they make today!!!
4159;But I will say that if you love this movie when it first came out you will love it even more now.
4160;They did a brilliant job with this movie.
4161;Its clear, loaded with colors and the sound is great.
4162;It takes you away to another world, especially with Julie Andrews in her prime.
4163;She was simply awesome in this movie and carried it with her God given beautiful voice.
4164;The songs are contagious and the story line is deep.
4165;bring all these things together and you have the perfect storm for one heck of a movie!!!
4166;Now that's a story line that grabs your attention and pulls you in.
4167;But I can almost guarantee that you will love it!!!
4168;Julie Andrews best film ever!!!
4169;love this movie and if you do its a must get on blue ray.
4170;I cant belive its been out over 45 years now wow.
4171;ray really makes the scenery pop, my kids love the sing.
4172;along option, and it has already given us hours of family fun.
4173;"Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are dynamic in this film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Sound of Music""."
4174;The cinematography and music are splendid, and Julie Andrews is amazing!
4175;20 years later and its still amazing.
4176;Wifes first time seeing it, so that was pretty cool to experience it with her.
4177;"Robert Wise's ""Sound of Music"" was one of the biggest successes among the movies that are musicals."
4178;It has a decent cast, positive outlook and an appealing story that is black and white.
4179;The movie was filmed in Salzburg and has beautiful photography.
4180;The movie has a lot of beautiful songs.
4181;There is some decent acting by people who play the part of Max Dettweiler and the Eleanor Parker, who plays the Baroness.
4182;Maria: I think it means that you want to be treated like a boy.
4183;"One portion in the movie where they talk about Austrian pride and show it when they sign the song ""Edelweiss"" in public is all fictional."
4184;It is the last one by Oscar Hammerstein and is beautifully written.
4185;It is one of the few movies that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, though I know people who are tired of it.
4186;It came out the same year as a number of great movies and yet had great success in the box office.
4187;It has Julie Andrews at her best with great outlook for the whole family, wonderful photography and Christopher Plummer doing a good job as a stern father.
4188;Though it is a great musical, it needs more imagination in its story and screenplay.
4189;For people who wish to collect the movie, a 40th anniversary edition of the movie is to be released in a couple of months with a great digital transfer.
4190;This is a very nice compilation of all things about the Sound of Music.
4191;Very nice package for any lovers of the movie.
4192;The movie is postively great.
4193;The audio and video is strickly tops all of the way.
4194;A Telegram from Daniel Truhitte is a nice little extra on disc 2.
4195;Also if you want to do a sing along with the film then simply bring up the wonderfully done english subtitles.
4196;The third disc with extras is spectacular.
4197;Showing so much photo's and movies clips and photo's of history of Austria is so amazing.
4198;Best one I ever bought with so many extra's.
4199;As most people know, Sound of Music is a great movie and has no need to review it further.
4200;I bought the film in blu.
4201;ray for my new blu.
4202;The other two discs, the special features blu.
4203;ray movies also played just fine so I figured it was this disc.
4204;A fantastic movie that should be required viewing for both cinematic and social reference.
4205;The film will bring back memories and have you singing for days.
4206;ray makes you feel like you are there.
4207;This is still a classic great movie!

4210;Best movie of all time!

4212;Young and old alike will love this movie classic most who see it for the first time will be astounded at the number of songs from the movie are already known.

4214;Love the digitally remasteted version almost as much as the first!
4215;She loves this musical and I surprised her with it on a huge order from Amazon.
4216;It is a great movie and definitely a classic to have in any library.
4217;We love the film and similar movies from the earlier decades of the 1900s.
4218;Perhaps it's because it's based on a true story, or perhaps it's because the musical numbers are so well written that I actually enjoyed them.
4219;Either way, it's one of the very few musicals that I appreciate.
4220;depth history about the real.
4221;trapp family, as well as alot of in.
4222;depth information about the Sound of Music musical, from it's birth as a broadway musical to it's silver screen debute.
4223;Great movie and great service
4224;Awesome service and pricing for this item !!
4225;Looking forward to more items at awesome prices as well !
4226;Hey its a classic my kid loved it now my grandkids love it too.
4227;Guaranteed to make you laugh , sing and cry
4228;That's because it has a great setting, great acting, and, well, great music.
4229;Fresh off of her great performance in Mary Poppins just a year earlier, Julie Andrews' momentum and obvious talent yields a performance of a lifetime in this 1965 masterpiece.
4230;The supporting cast does a stellar job as well.
4231;Above all, this film gets the respect it deserves in the form of restoration that's superb.
4232;The extras are good viewing as well.
4233;At 33 years of age, I finally saw the Sound of Music.
4234;and I thought it was wonderful!
4235;Although the movie is nearly three hours long, it possesses so much charm and beauty that I truly enjoyed every minute of it.
4236;show alone justifies purchasing the movie.
4237;Also, the scenary Austrian countryside is absolutely breathtaking!The Sound of Music is definitely worth seeing.
4238;the movie is a classic, one of the best ever made!This again proves you don't need violence and killing to have great entertainment.
4239;This edition tops the 1995 laserdisc by allowing the sparkling, exemplary design of its 70mm.
4240;The 4.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is powerful and clean, but since this film was originally mixed for six.
4241;Nonethless, the film sounds terrific.
4242;The extra features make this package a bargain at the price.
4243;Full length commentary by director Bob Wise, with the musical numbers presented sans vocals, is a great touch.
4244;"And the two documentaries are beautifully presented
I:18730;4245;Loved the movie and watched it without any problems!
I:18730;4246;Well I've always loved the Sound of Music, since I was a kid.
I:18730;4247;And now finally it's on Blu.
I:18730;4248;this Box Set is very nice.
I:18730;4249;everything else is great too .
I:18730;4250;very nice presentation when you open it up, and it was shipped in it's own special boxto insure a safe delivery.
I:18730;4251;Everyone pretty much knows the screen adaptation of the life of Maria Augusta Von Trapp, who went from a postulate with a true desire to give her life in service to God, to becoming the mother of 7 children plus 3 more of her own.
I:18730;4252;That was the part that I became intensely interested in because what Hollywood tends to do is take """"creative"""" license with any story and fit it into whatever fits the mold they want, regardless of the truth."""
4253;Vivid, pure colors with incredible sound.
4254;The majesty of the Austrian mountains and villages as well as the story that pulls on the heartstrings and gives you moments to pause and admire.
4255;elegant Ms. Andrews, who is as gracious and beautiful and charming as always, and then you are brought to the movie.
4256;friendly movie was made from start to finish.
4257;What a story you will be given!
4258;"difficult"" during the initial part of the filming, and that he agreed with W. c. Fields in that he also liked children."
4259;During this documentary, the fact that he didn't try to hide behind the truth was an interesting insight.
4260;Her love for the Captain, and his desire to support the family, were immensely distorted in the film.
4261;Also, Maria's issues with control, and the childrens issues with their subserviance to her, led to a great deal of sadness and despair, which makes for the sobering reality of the real life of Maria Von Trapp.
4262;this movie itself is pure joy and comfort, and it is just perfect.
4263;But it is the insight into how it was made, and the story of the real Maria, that makes for a more pensive thought.
4264;The whole family is excited to watch this movie because this movie really offer valuable lessons for our lives.
4265;The classic we all know very well.
4266;As per description, if you are a collector, definitely a worth while addition to your collection.
4267;It is a great movie for children and adults.
4268;It is great to show in a music class if you are a teacher.
4269;This is the favorite movie for my 4 year old and I to watch together.
4270;It is a classic gem of a movie already, and the blu ray just makes it that much more breathtaking.
4271;This is real acting, real singing, real cinematography, real directing.
4272;this is a must for any fan of the film
4273;so I bought a new Samsung BR player.
4274;after that it was pleasant experience all the way.
4275;If you love a good story.
4276;and good music this is an all time classic.
4277;Beautiful story, music and shots of the landscape.
4278;Watched it with my kids and they loved it.
4279;This was a gift, so I also had time constraints in ordering it.
4280;Gave out one to family member and loved it as well.
4281;This movie is uplifting, optimistic, and cheerful in the best way.
4282;There are lots of bonus items: a musical box, postcards, a book about the history of the movie, etc.
4283;This movie is really borring.
4284;The only person that did a good job was James Cann.
4285;He was good as the comic relief in that movie.
4286;as far as I'm concerned, this is the best blu ray I own .
4287;Also, from what I understand, the restoration process was taken extremely seriously and done with the highest technology possible.
4288;There's a reason why so many artists are pushing blu ray, and it's because for the first time people can experience their creativity and attention to detail, as it was meant to be seen.
4289;There is SO much detail in this movie.
4290;Not to mention it's cram packed with amazing extras that are actually watchable.
4291;In case you can't tell, this BD just makes me so happy.
4292;If you grew up with this classic musical as I did then you will want to own this beautiful set.
4293;ray is incredible and the set is chock full of extra goodies and keepsakes for the true admirer of this film.
4294;This makes a great gift item as it contains a lot of behind the scenes information that really round out the whole story.
4295;Great gift to give to anyone.
4296;It was great to see the behind the scenes segments.
4297;I will always love this movie, Julie Andrews and all.
4298;It is especially fun to watch after visiting the Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont and hearing about Maria von Trapp, and the story of the Trapp Family Singers .
4299;how they came to the US, and were a successful singing group.
4300;I've loved this musical since I was a child.
4301;Thank you for the amazing talent in this movie, it's timeless!!
4302;This is one of the timeless classic musical.
4303;The music inspires uplifting moods.
4304;Great childhood and family memories are made with this movie.
4305;The breathtaking scenery, perfect voice of Maria by Julie Andrews, a remarkable handsome Captain by Christopher Plummer (who then became my favorite male star), the children's singings, the beautiful dance by Rolf and Liesl, the wonderful classical music,.
4306;my heart wants to sing every song it hears , this came into my heart so deeply and now it's what I would say.
4307;I liked music when I was small, but after watching this movie, I became not only like music but couldn't stopping loving music.
4308;What a magic by 'The sound of music'!
4309;Now I still keep watching this film occasionally, and always listen to the soundtrack, it's so relaxing.
4310;thanks Robert Wise, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, without your efforts, we couldn't have such a favorite movie.
4311;I probably will introduce this movie to anyone in the world.
4312;I used to watch this movie with my grandmother when I was young.
4313;My grandmother is gone now, but her love and spirit still remain.
4314;This is one of the best movies of all times.
4315;Based on a true story, this movie has all the history, drama and music a family can enjoy together.
4316;This is a great movie in my opinion.
4317;It is a very unique movie putting both live action and animation together in an entertaining way.
4318;I am 15 years old and feel I'm still a child at heart and this movie always brings out the child in me.
4319;it is a must see to all musical lovers.
4320;you cant pass over seeing such an iconic classic.
4321;Julie Andrews is beautiful and brilliant as always.
4322;you laugh and cry and sing along to this amazing production.
4323;Julie Andrews is simply the best.
4324;This 45th Anniversary is Great!!!!!
4325;It was a gift for my wife, and she loved it . . . . . . . . .
4326;This is great for my movie collection, but I was super surprised at much I enjoyed the 87 minute documentary about how the movie came to be, it was fascinating, and the interviews with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and other cast members was perfect.
4327;"It looks great on my 52"" screen."
4328;It was a pleasure to watch the film again.
4329;Wonderful story that can be viewed many times by young children and those older.
4330;Wonderful songs that stay in your mind.
4331;It comes with a wonderful collection of goodies, including a music box.
4332;I haven't watched the entire movie yet, but the scenes I did watch looked beautiful on Blu.
4333;Another special feature allows you to explore the Austrian locations for the film.
4334;This blu ray box set is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone because I know anybody would love to have this for a belonging.
4335;This is a great movie for the holidays.
4336;My family sat in front of the TV enjoying this classic film
4337;The Sound of Music was great before the re.
4338;This movie and soundtrack was a favorite of mine (and my family's) growing up.
4339;This is a fun musical with a deep story to it.
4340;And now, I watch it with my son:) Julie Andrews is always a delight, as well as the rest of the cast.
4341;with that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary.
4342;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition is vibrant.
4343;There is so much detail in this latest version of The Sound of Music , it's incredible!
4344;I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu.
4345;may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of The Sound of Music than ever before.
4346;Absolutely breathtaking!Once again, the crew who restored this film.
4347;what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu.
4348;ray is absolutely fantastic!AUDIO and SUBTITLES: The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition is presented in English 7.1 DTS.
4349;Because the film was shot with a 6.
4350;The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done.
4351;The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing Maria to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing.
4352;i absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it.
4353;If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home.
4354;Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.
4355;And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.
4356;A new way to watch The Sound of Music .
4357;If you select this option for viewing the movie, you have four categories which you can select interaction with the viewer.
4358;scenes images, the other is viewing with on.
4359;A lively commentary by the five individuals.
4360;Although these are separate commentaries recorded in separate times but Julie Andrews definitely gives us a good idea of the sets and various shooting locations.
4361;Also, hearing from Plummer of how he doesn't like to work with children but in this case, he got a long with the children quite well.
4362;This first special feature is actually an interactive backlot tour with plenty of in.
4363;depth featurettes on the songs, the stage show, the movie, the film and sound restoration and getting to know the real life von Trapp family.
4364;(3:53) The popularity of Rodgers and Hammerstein and how they crafted hit after hit.9.
4365;(4:50) The original screen adaptation of the von Trapp and the differences between stage and the film adaptation.10.
4366;Final Dream: Oscar Hammerstein Remembered .
4367;Because so many people have traveled to Salzburg for The Sound of Music Tour or to visit the locations shown on the film, this special feature is great as you can select a map and get video to know about the locations, photos and fascinating facts of the area.
4368;(1:27:22) A documentary on the real von Trapp story and how the the film received the green light.
4369;Robert Wise talks about casting and cast talk about their involvement in the film and what they wanted for the film.2.
4370;production, filming on location, the music and working with the cast and crew.
4371;(1:23:25) Popular Broadway talent Mary Martin hosts a documentary on Rodgers and Hammerstein, the history and hits of this dynamic duo and their work on Oklahoma , Carousel , Flower Drum Song , The King and I and The Sound of Music .9.
4372;Featuring performances by both women and also Julie Andrews interviewing Maria von Trapp.3.
4373;Featuring concept art, storyboards and still photos from the film.
4374;I received it in the proper time frame.
4375;I do love this film, thank you.
4376;This film will outlive all of us alive today, and continue its glorious story for generations to come.
4377;Got this as a gift for my Dad and he loves it.
4378;My wife and I loved it and so did our grandchildren!
4379;Brings a true classic to your home, and one does not have to worry about edits and commercials.
4380;She loves this type of movie and so do I!
4381;The extra items were nice and the price was right.
4382;Even though I heard from friends who went on the tour in Salzburg they left by train, and Maria Von Trapp's books say so as well, the movie adaptation at the beginning is what I remember from Austrian Alps and is still breathtaking to watch and listen to.
4383;That is my favorite part.
4384;I found a lot of the beginning scenery of the Alps were also in the 1956 version, so this 1963 version, as well done and beautiful as it is, already had a foundation in the 1956 movie.
4385;So worth watching both to compare.
4386;Both versions are very good with all the actors.
4387;The Sound of Music came alive for the small group of nursing home residents I showed it to.
4388;Great storyline and lots of talent.
4389;its a movie that gives hope.
4390;This is another all time favorite of mine.
4391;If you like musicals this is among the BEST!
4392;Got this movie for a great price and have watched many times over already.
4393;Whether young or old, it's a film that captures you right from the very beginning.
4394;The songs are sung and performed well, woven into the story almost effortlessly it seems.
4395;maria (wonderfully played by Julie Andrews) arrives at the Von Trapp family mansion to be governess to Captain Von Trapp's 7 children.
4396;She weathers the tricks and reaches out to them with love and teaches them to sing.
4397;since the death of his wife Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) has grieved deeply, and won't allow the house with singing and laughter .
4398;Gradually his heart is softened as Maria encourages him to get to know his children, and as music and laughter and love re.
4399;a great film filled with the sound of children.
4400;an old favorite of the family, now it looks great and sounds awesome after finally retiring the old vhs copy.
4401;Frau Maria and Baron Von Trapp eventually marry to form one complete happy family.
4402;There begins the Von Trapp family's suspenseful episode as they attempt to escape the clutches of the Nazis.
4403;the plot and the majestic sceneries are more than enough to keep the viewer entertained, touched and occupied.
4404;Add in the brilliance of the Richard Rodgers Oscar Hammerstein III songwriting team and you have an unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.
4405;I have been greatly privileged to watch this movie for countless times in my lifetime, both as a boy and as an adult.
4406;I look forward to watching it many more times in the future, hopefully with a bouncing grandchild perched on my lap!I just love this movie.
4407;In a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this at 11!
4408;We are happy about it.
4409;The Sound of Music is one of the greatest movies ever made.
4410;I saw this marvelous movie in a theater in San Diego in 1965.
4411;ray edition brings back the original sound and video with a vengeance.
4412;Also, Amazon was quick with free shipping and they had best price I could find.
4413;but the music and the romance keeps these codgers happy.
4414;I recall watching this at the old Carolina Cinema on the HUGE screen in Charlotte with family and friends.
4415;It has everything: charm, music and an engaging storyline.
4416;SOM has received so many re.
4417;Generation after generation can relate to it, and the soundtrack is so special that you will be singing along in no time.
4418;For example, considerable colourisation has been done to a number of scenes because the film has faded over the years.
4419;It therefores adds an unnatural aspect to it all.
4420;That's all that is needed to be said about this beautifully filmed movie.
4421;The scenery, acting and music is beyond any musical ever brought to the screen.
4422;This movie won numerous Academy Awards when it was first released and is still a timeless treasure.
4423;It is truly a masterpiece!
4424;In addition to having the movie (a classic) .
4425;the special features are amazing, educational, insighful, entertaining.
4426;To see and hear the original cast members chat about their experiences and memories during the filming of the original movie is fantastic.
4427;You get to see the real Maria on whose life the story was based, and discover that she had a small appearance in the actual movie.
4428;There is so much to learn regarding the background of this movie.
4429;Our 8yr old thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 5yr old, and it was nice to have something suitable to look at with our children.
4430;This is one of my favorite movies, and having it on blu.
4431;lots of singing and great story line.
4432;classic that can be seen over and over
4433;i initially bought this for my wife, who loved it, and because of this kind gesture, I was forced to watch it.
4434;To my suprise, I loved it.
4435;the acting is superb by the main characters.
4436;And yes great songs that will stick in your head long after you have watched it.
4437;That's all I can say about this movie in one word.
4438;This seriously is an amazing story, based on a freakin' true story might I add!
4439;Seriously, this movie will move you, if not, become your top 10 movies of all time.
4440;One of my favorite movies!
4441;I love every thing in the box!
4442;This is a definite all time classic.
4443;i think what realy makes this movie the classic that it is,is the very good script and fine acting by all the characters.
4444;while its kind of ok,some of it never realy hit the spot with me.
4445;i enjoy watching the actual movie,and they just happen to be in a bad place when war is breaking out.
4446;I grew up watching Sound of Music, so I was happy to be able to share this wonderful classic with my two boys!!
4447;it destroyed my confidence for all blu.
4448;First time I seen this movie was over 20 years ago.
4449;ray version is much better now.
4450;The extra features are nice too.
4451;It is encouraging, exciting and brings joy to the family when watching.
4452;old says, It's so amazing because the children don't know how to sing, but then they do thanks to Maria!
4453;It's a movie you can enjoy from time to time, again and again, and pass on to the next generation, and next generation.
4454;I like see this movie.
4455;It's amazing see old movie with new transfer digital and a lot of bonus in this edition.
4456;Transfer video it's excellent with perfect audio.
4457;Also, I collect music boxes and I loved that a hand painted music box was part of this collection.
4458;I love this collection, it has so many wonderful goodies and well worth the price.
4459;This box set is so gorgeous and makes a great item to add to my collection (already have Dances with Wolves and Schindlers List).
4460;There was also a 4 disc box set to enjoy watching the movie again and again on our new blu ray player.
4461;I was able to share this musical with my kids (ages 3 and 5) and they were so into it the whole time.
4462;I love this item and hope everyone gets a chance to add it to their collection!!
4463;My wife loved this set as a Christmas gift.
4464;She loves the movie, so this was a great gift.
4465;The two books are great and fact filled, the photos are a nice little edition.
4466;And the movie, as always (and forever) is spectacular.
4467;I really would rate this movie with 1000 stars as the kids have been always kids in every time.
4468;I really love the movie as it was premiered on February 7, 1965, the day when I was born and I just admire the movie by its musical score and the fabulous cast.
4469;When I was about 19 I saw SOM in a real movie theater palace .
4470;There were also beautiful and expensive programs booklets available in these palaces.
4471;The opening scene was breathtaking!
4472;A few years ago I saw it at the American Film Institute .
4473;I did notice that the younger generation was having a great time .
4474;and just loving every moment of the film.
4475;I shared with him my experience .
4476;I still loved the AFI presentation in spite of its flaws which conflicted with my experience of 45 years ago!This restoration is a real treat .
4477;it brings beautiful and rapturous memories!
4478;The Sound of Music is one of my favorite musicals/movies ever.
4479;I love the sing along music and the actors are perfect for the roles that they play.
4480;My love for The Sound of Music began as a little girl, singing the songs at the top of my lungs.
4481;It has always been my favorite movie.
4482;My 10 and 9 year olds love it.
4483;This movie is a classic, which goes without saying, which is why I had to have it for my collection.
