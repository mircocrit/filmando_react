I:12850;1;Other than that, it is a decent movie.
I:12850;2;Freedom is loved and desired.
I:12850;3;(The father's work is waning, so he works as a professor.)
I:12850;4;"The angst of their emotions comes out in vivid ways: The older boy enters a talent contest stealing a Pink Floyd song
I:12850;5;nevertheless, the movie offers glimmers of hope.
I:12850;6;"The music, especially ""Hey You"" by Pink Floyd and a Lou Reed song from his ""Street Hassle"" album couldn't be topped for evoking feelings of alienation and loneliness, yet they provide, like the movie itself, healing beauty for the characters and viewers."
I:12850;7;The acting is genuine and natural, and the story is presented in a haunting way.
I:12850;8;bernard Berkman (an outstanding Jeff Daniels) is a washed.
I:12850;9;in between their battles are the kids, 16.
I:12850;10;Bernard is the centerpiece of the story, he's a complicated, intense and frustrated man, jealous of his wife's success, and shields his disappointments with a type of holier than thou pride.
I:12850;11;"He turns into a type of miniature Bernard
I:12850;12;as Joan, Linney is in fine form as usual and expertly handles a role that is at first more complex than it seems.
I:12850;13;"Her new found artistic inclinations have helped her find sides of herself that she didn't know existed
I:12850;14;Baumbach manages to say it all in such brief screen time, encapsulating the sentiment and the unsparing honesty, and making us laugh in the midst of tragedy.
I:12850;15;The film doesn't offer any solutions to heartbreak of breakups, but the film is cut and shot in a way that emphasizes the darkly comic contours of miscommunication and reminds us of the humanity lying beneath the surface of families like the Berkmans.
I:12850;16;"Having the kid plagiarize ""Hey You"" and we are supposed to believe no one in a New York City audience in the 1980s (save one or two) recognized one of that decade's most famous rock songs!"
I:12850;17;"definitely worth seeing and literate articulate dialogue, but you have to ask, ""what's the point?"""
I:12850;18;balanced and yet quite an interesting inide flick.
I:12850;19;Of course the stars pull another great performance off and although the movie doesn't have a major plot, I thought it was a realistic portrayal of an American family going through a divorce in real time.
I:12850;20;I recommend this film to anyone who loves an offbeat indie flick, enjoy!
I:12850;21;Good could of ended better .
I:12850;22;Jeff Daniels is really good .
I:12850;23;One day I will give this movie the proper review it deserves.
I:12850;24;But succinctly: Baumbach has created a masterpiece.
I:12850;25;"painfully honest and exceptionally ""real."""
I:12850;26;"The dialogue feels accurate
I:12850;27;It has a lot of insight to offer, even if you've never found yourself in the same place these characters find themselves in.
I:12850;28;Our principals here are among the millions of Americans making a living as novelists and New Yorker essayists.
I:12850;29;Wife Joan is equally two.
I:12850;30;The Squid and the Whale is one of the more poetic and well conceived movies I have seen in a while.
I:12850;31;The fluid transitions of humor, jealousy, fantasy, forgiveness, and growth flesh out the story as a truly classic tragic comedy.
I:12850;32;jeff Daniels and Laura Linney both do an amazing job of bringing out all the irony and contradictions of their characters.
I:12850;33;other and their children creating a very powerful ebb and flow of humor, hope and failure.
I:12850;34;the soundtrack is quirky and always fits in nicely with the story.
I:12850;35;There's a good mix of well know musicians like Lou Reed and Pink Floyd with top notch but relatively unknown musicians like Pentangle's Bert Jansch or The Feelies.
I:12850;36;what really shines the most in this movie is the writing.
I:12850;37;There are so many well expressed dimensions about the complications of relationships, and so many hidden gems of humor and insight that it provokes thoughtfulness and laughter (sometimes at the same time).
I:12850;38;Every scene strikes you as totally believable.
I:12850;39;This realization is achieved in a subtle, profound way by Director Baumbach.
I:12850;40;"and any movie that leaves you singing ""Hey You"" for a week is worthy of a wholehearted recommendation."
I:12850;41;You spend much of the film laughing at this fractured family and their members' numerous personal disasters, but, in the end, that feeling of bittersweet humanity weighs.
I:12850;42;It's a gorgeous, pitch perfect film.
I:12850;43;aggrandizing snob and former novelist star.
I:12850;44;Walt mimics the adults and calmly asks who will take care of the cat.
I:12850;45;the film's tone is one of gently mocking humor, a sort of infinitely sensitive satire.
I:12850;46;the script is intelligent, with subtle revelations and much between the lines.
I:12850;47;The sparring between these family members feels very real, with old wounds resurfacing in fresh attacks, with battle lines drawn along the film's opening tennis match (Mom and Frank vs. Dad and Walt).
I:12850;48;This is a biographical film, and writer/director Noah Baumbach treats his (highly personal) subject with delicacy, intelligence and a fair degree of objectivity.
I:12850;49;Everyone is imperfect (we even wondered which brother Noah was, as both are pretty damning), but they also have moments of grace.
I:12850;50;offSmart People) and Owen Kline, are amazing.
I:12850;51;Overall, one of our favorite films.
I:12850;52;The Squid and the Whale is an excellent film but it takes a while to warm up to it.
I:12850;53;get good grades, study hard, pass your tests, have all your priorities straight, etc.
I:12850;54;Clever way of organizing the 7 days of the week!
I:12850;55;This leads to a few hilarious and embarrassing scenes involving a girlfriend of his.
I:12850;56;overall, the Squid and the Whale is a funny film that's more like a drama, but not in the usual sense.
I:12850;57;You have to really pay attention to the storyline and the jokes will seem funnier.
I:12850;58;Daniels is brilliant in the movie as an arrogant author past his glory days who, when his marriage ends, sees himself as the victim in the situation and declares a passive.
I:12850;59;Linney, as usual, is good.
I:12850;60;Though the movie didn't completely bowl me over, it contains strong performances and good writing.
I:12850;61;The Squid and the Whale is one of the most tender, subtle, and underrated films of the last decade.
I:12850;62;It also is yet another testament to the talent of Noah Baumbach.
I:12850;63;Baumbach as auteur succeeds in creating an immediate experience for his viewers and embroils us in his very personal depiction of the terminal point in a marriage.
I:12850;64;The film evidences the way in which childhood pain seldom dissipates even with the passage of decades.
I:12850;65;He engages us from the onset and we find it practically impossible to take our eyes off him.
I:12850;66;The Squid and the Whale reveals veritas with grace, sympathy, and eloquence.
I:12850;67;It is one of the finest and most important movies that I've ever seen.
I:12850;68;But if you grew up in the 80's and you love dark, dry humor.
I:12850;69;Jeff Daniels is brilliant, and everyone else is good, too.
I:12850;70;"Especially Billy Baldwin
I:12850;71;Pink Floyd was one of the biggest bands of the 70s and 80s.
I:12850;72;But the marriage has lasted nearly sixteen years and produced two children.
I:12850;73;At one point during a talent show he goes so far as to steal a new Pink Floyd song and play it off as his own, thus winning the grand prize.
I:12850;74;The younger brother, Frank (Owen Kline), is attached to his mother but also loves Walt, and the stress of the marriage's break.
I:12850;75;it is the young boys who really pulled this movie up to a higher standing that it could ever hope to be and the script helped them out, making their portrayals relatively interesting to watch.
I:12850;76;For instance, as Walt discovers the truth about his father and his mother (how screwed up they both are) he has to come to terms with becoming his own man.
I:12850;77;so that's the good parts of this award winning flick.
I:12850;78;"Titles are important to me
I:12850;79;None of the characters are funny or likable.
I:12850;80;I loved that this was set in 1986 Brooklyn, so evocative of a time lost.
I:12850;81;The two kids give rather astonishing performances, squirm.
I:12850;82;There's no plot, but the writing is the real star here, and it shines.
I:12850;83;In reading the critics I believed that 'The Squid and the Whale' was one of those rare contemporary dramas actually geared for grown.
I:12850;84;lifer that watches like an R. rated afterschool special.
I:12850;85;This makes her character all the more intriguing.
I:12850;86;Overall this is an interesting and balanced film.
I:12850;87;Definitely a great film and seeing where these stars first began.
I:12850;88;in my opinion this film is seriously underrated.
I:12850;89;It's covers some serious issues about a family, but its also funny.
I:12850;90;Though it's only a tennis match, it's more than that.
I:12850;91;I mean, it's gross when he turns into the bug, but I love how matter of fact everything is.
I:12850;92;She laughs] Cause it's written by Franz Kafka.
I:12850;93;"He is like Mr. Jones in Bob Dylan's ""Ballad of a Thin Man."
I:12850;94;You've been with the professorsAnd they've all liked your looksWith great lawyers you haveDiscussed lepers and crooksYou've been through all ofF.
I:12850;95;"This film reminds me a lot of ""Smart People"" and the professor played by Dennis Quaid is a lot like Professor Bernard Berkman."
I:12850;96;"Still I like ""The Squid and the Whale"" better because ""Smart People"" plays more like a conventional Romantic Comedy while TSATW unfolds with the quirky cadences of real life."
I:12850;97;pam: I mean that as a compliment.
I:12850;98;q: Didn't Annie Hall win a ton of Oscars, very unusual for a comedy?A: Yes, it won for best picture, best screenplay, best director, and Diane Keaton won best actress.
I:12850;99;Woody Allen was also nominated for best actor.
I:12850;100;Now she is his love interest.
I:12850;101;"q: ""The Squid and the Whale"" is rather quirky, but also realistic."
I:12850;102;q: You are so smart.
I:12850;103;walter Berkman: It's Welles' masterpiece, really.
I:12850;104;As it is, it's still brilliant.
I:12850;105;the film has a stellar storyline with its dark dialogue and its spurts of comedic relief, and just its total reality.
I:12850;106;But the actors are what really make this film.
I:12850;107;Laura Linney is one of the best, underappreciated actresses in holiday, and Jeff Daniels has this amazing way of playing a totally likable A**hole.
I:12850;108;All of the actors/characters really suck you in, and make you feel like you are experiencing their pain first hand.
I:12850;109;funny, dark, depressing and so accurate, this movie takes you inside the war zone that is a divided family, and magically, you come out unscathed.
I:12850;110;Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale is a good example of this genre.
I:12850;111;It's kind of like that other nearly mainstream movie of his,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou .
I:12850;112;This one is more realistic than The Life Aquatic, but it has that same kind of quirkiness.
I:12850;113;Meanwhile, his wife, the nice one, is just as messed up.
I:12850;114;And the kids, well, they are the epitome of dysfunction.
I:12850;115;"The father gives the older one advice such as ""Sleep with her and see what it's like."
I:12850;116;here, the drama is more important than the comedy, and I don't think I laughed at all, but it's still that kind of movie.
I:12850;117;The Squid and the Whale is a short, quick, handsomely made and extremely well.
I:12850;118;acted, yet completely deplorable film.
I:12850;119;I will repeat that it's really a very seriously well.
I:12850;120;"I grew up in a midwestern college town and had friends who grew up in homes similar to the one depicted in ""The Squid and The Whale""."
I:12850;121;The always interesting Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney play two liberal, self.
I:12850;122;What makes this movie great is that in a mere 81 minutes, Baumbach provides a lifetime's worth of background for those who care to look for it.
I:12850;123;Excrutiating, but well worth the time taken to watch it.
I:12850;124;"I really enjoyed this movie
I:12850;125;"collegiate comedy ""Kicking and Screaming"" and is also the son of Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and novelist and critic Jonathan Baumbach."
I:12850;126;Reportedly, the movie is based on his own experiences growing up and, while the family portrait is at times harsh, it still feels loving and real.
I:12850;127;Linney's Joan is pragmatic, but also mostly sympathetic.
I:12850;128;"Despite its downbeat subject matter, ""Squid"" is actually more comedy than drama
I:12850;129;"Kids making out to the Cars' ""Drive,"" Burger King glasses and just the general vibe of the decor all hit the mark."
I:12850;130;really does look like a young Monica Vitti.
I:12850;131;Joan and Bernard are a couple with two kids and they both write as their profession.
I:12850;132;Joan, on the other hand, is featured in the New Yorker, and her book has received good critical reviews.
I:12850;133;Walt enters in a school competition and does a Pink Floyd song as his own.
I:12850;134;The dialogue is quick, real, and immensely funny.
I:12850;135;It's hard to find a sympathetic character.
I:12850;136;This family has it's share of problems.
I:12850;137;ALthough I felt the storyline with the tennis pro turned teacher had little or no effect on the story it was great seeing another Baldwin brother on the screen.
I:12850;138;there are other reasons why this movie is deplorable, and many other reasons I'll never recommend it, but the above is enough for me.
I:12850;139;This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath.
I:12850;140;He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear.
I:12850;141;After a family meeting when they tell Walt and his younger brother Frank that they are separating, the film tracks how everyone takes sides, plays favorites, blames, and manipulates.
I:12850;142;This film won numerous awards, but I thought it had an ambiguous and unsatisfying ending. . . like those of many families deconconstructed by failed marriages.
I:12850;143;Because that is the best way to teach their children how to behave the same way, and the best way to give those children a good start in life.
I:12850;144;and so as I watch this self.
I:12850;145;modern lifestyle it is that they are upholding, I am reminded sharply, once again, thank God, I still have my family, and I don't want to be like these people, and I don't want my kids to end up so screwed up like their kids.
I:12850;146;I intensely disliked them within the first few minutes of the film.
I:12850;147;Try thinking of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton without the charm.
I:12850;148;Even the family cat is treated shabbily.
I:12850;149;jeff Daniels pulls off his best performance on screen of his career and argueably the same can be said as well for Laura Linney.
I:12850;150;"This award winning movie is extremly well thoughtout and it's screenplay very easily could have out done ""Crash"" for Best Screenplay."
I:12850;151;Tight script, excellent acting, really depressing.
I:12850;152;Laura Linney is great (as usual), while seeing Jeff Daniels go against character and play a narcissistic jerk is something of a revelation.
I:12850;153;The younger actors who play their troubled sons are both also quite good.
I:12850;154;This film is good .
I:12850;155;mom gets into a relationship with a school tennis coach ,dad gets involved so to speak with a student .
I:12850;156;a recommended film for those who like quiet thoughtful films.
I:12850;157;I think this film is a classic.
I:12850;158;Laura Linney is great too, minimal makeup and still very sexy in her own way.
I:12850;159;I really liked the movie, it felt like watching one of my neighbors next door.
I:12850;160;but some one out there please explain the last few minutes with the older boy in the museum.
I:12850;161;On the technical level, along with Wes Anderson and a few others, Noah Baumbach is at the forefront of what I believe to be a New American and Independent Cinema, where the actors, their words, expressions and actions are as powerful and real as the viewer meeting these people on the streets.
I:12850;162;Baumbach is a brilliant story teller of everyday life.
I:12850;163;For this it is real, and something we can all relate to.
I:12850;164;Yes, I agree with other reviewers, Jeff Daniels performance is terrific.
I:12850;165;As for the boys, I think we have two engaging independent movie stars for us to follow for the years to come.
I:12850;166;Baumbach's hometown is depicted as it should be, a beautiful and equal borough to Manhattan in most respects.
I:12850;167;What I like most about this 2005 film is also ironically what I don't like about it .
I:12850;168;As the son of two writers himself, Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and novelist Jonathan Baumbach, he knows firsthand the trauma and emotional toll that divorce has on all the participants, in particular, the children.
I:12850;169;The dynamics causing the break.
I:12850;170;Bernard was once a successful novelist sliding toward obscurity as a creative writing professor, while Joan is starting to enjoy success as a professional novelist.
I:12850;171;What's more and what Baumbach captures expertly with some sharp dialogue and character nuance, Bernard is an elitist suffering from wounded pride over his failure as both writer and breadwinner, while Joan is rather passive.
I:12850;172;baumbach has fortunately recruited two fine actors to play these roles.
I:12850;173;centric character and achieves resonance in letting us peek at the pained man inside.
I:12850;174;"It's a refreshingly fearless turn by an actor who hasn't done anything this interesting since Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo""."
I:12850;175;In the less showy but equally unsentimental role of Joan, Laura Linney once again proves she is among the top echelon of screen actresses today with her piercing intelligence coming through her often bedraggled appearance.
I:12850;176;the two sons naturally take sides once their lives are impacted.
I:12850;177;On the sidelines are a couple of surprisingly effective performances .
I:12850;178;"who ironically played Daniels's daughter in the family film, ""Fly Away Home"" ."
I:12850;179;Regardless, the acting carries the day here.
I:12850;180;Very thought provoking realistic script with confronting aspects about divorce, marriage and sibling relationships.
I:12850;181;driven movie I root for.
I:12850;182;There are four distinct characters.
I:12850;183;the way the movie explores our way of avoiding each other and shirting blame Is incredibly realistic and quite confrontational, even if you're not situations as extreme as these kids.
I:12850;184;PERFECT FOR A FILM DISCUSSION GROUP.
I:12850;185;I absolutely love this film.
I:12850;186;It is vaguely depressing and mildly disturbing, yes, but it captures the aftermath of divorce wonderfully and truthfully.
I:12850;187;"Simply put, this Indy film is the fantastically honest film that ""Hollywood"" could never have achieved so brilliantly."
I:12850;188;The mother, played by Laura Linney, is a brilliant writer who outshines her husband's talents, but has a habit of being brutally honest (usually in an unflattering way) as well as sexually promiscuous.
I:12850;189;It is in the story of the two sons that the film hits emotional paydirt.
I:12850;190;"while ""The Squid and the Whale"" marks the breaking apart of a family, it is also a fantastic coming."
I:12850;191;age story that is refreshingly without the often typical ersatz Hollywood pathos.
I:12850;192;This is a story, at least the basis of a story, that many share in one form or another, but rarely talk about in such frank and honest terms.
I:12850;193;(One wonders how the variance toward abnormal is actually to be measured, since these preternaturally insightful and sensitive boys .
I:12850;194;glances, gestures, words, actions .
I:12850;195;"story puts one right in mind of ""Diary of A Mad Housewife"": Laura Linney's ""Joan"" is really ""Teen"" five years later."
I:12850;196;(Laura Linney is once again marvelous in her portrayal, although I think underutilized by the director.
I:12850;197;"but there is more onanism than that: what we really have from Baumbach is a ""hero quest"" with the Walt persona winning through to self."
I:12850;198;Walt, er, Noah wins through and that's what matters .
I:12850;199;Nobody's likeable in the movie and you could care less at the movie's ending what happens to any of them.
I:12850;200;one star only because Daniels and Linney give great performances.
I:12850;201;star actors and I've been a fan of both for years.
I:12850;202;The performances were outstanding, but plot and story.
I:12850;203;, a divorce, and the effect it has on the two adolescent sons.
I:12850;204;events in the film, especially those involving the sons, are rather disturbing, to say the least.
I:12850;205;Noah Baumbach makes an impressive debut as writer/director of his autobiographical story THE SQUID AND THE WHALE.
I:12850;206;It is a piece of life sliced out of the 1980s that is just as pertinent to today's culture as it was to the period piece Baumbach resurrects.
I:12850;207;They have two boys: Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) is a teenager who writes music and worships his father's literary mind while the younger Frank (Owen Kline) is a wide eyed devotee of his mother's affection.
I:12850;208;driven Frank's life and blurring Bernard's perception of propriety.
I:12850;209;rate movie making from a young artist with an exciting future.
I:12850;210;It will be great to watch for his next, less personalized story.
I:12850;211;After a promising start, with some very competent acting, dramatic set.
I:12850;212;I believe that's in large part due to the outstanding talents of the cast, most notably Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels, who exhibit such raw, believable honesty we find ourselves voyeuristically drawn into their dissolving marriage.
I:12850;213;It's an uncomfortable feeling and it works brilliantly.
I:12850;214;with the two sons in the family, Baumbach seems to stumble.
I:12850;215;and his pales in comparison with the younger, but since he represents Baumbach in the script, well that's who we're supposed to root for.
I:12850;216;"But ""Squid and the Whale"" wants us to believe that his is the higher struggle ."
I:12850;217;heady stuff, which I believe could have been accomplished given Baumbach's exceptional writing.
I:12850;218;What you should know is that the movie is about a family.
I:12850;219;Jeff Daniels does a good job predicating the role of a father who doesnt have many accolades in life to rely on.
I:12850;220;His wife,played by Laura Linney,who's a more successful writer than him, has a rather interesting character owing to her success within the movie.
I:12850;221;The Squid and the Whale has a very calm script and an even more interesting soundtrack.
I:12850;222;"I saw a movie earlier this year called ""The Upside of anger"" and I liked it but it had a much too gack for my liking,yet a fine watch."
I:12850;223;what I really admired about this film is the character growth I noticed in the sons.
I:12850;224;I liked how the film seems unpompous and the acting is as good as it gets,really.
I:12850;225;It is the best movie of 2005, closely edging out Oldboy.
I:12850;226;the movie combines drama and comedy but comedy reigns more often.
I:12850;227;jeff Daniels is Bernard, a once famous writer, still working on a new book, but also a teacher.
I:12850;228;She now is taking on writing and her immediate success is getting Bernard mad.
I:12850;229;walt is a high schooler played by Jesse Eisenberg, getting closer and closer to his first sexual encounter.
I:12850;230;His brother Frank, played by Owen Kline, is an 11 year old (or so) finding out about sex.
I:12850;231;By the way, that's probably where the strong sexuality label comes from: Frank's masturbation.
I:12850;232;life is going pretty well for them.
I:12850;233;the movie deals with how the 4 members of the family deal with this.
I:12850;234;They are very similiar but this movie is better.
I:12850;235;the acting is outstanding but Jeff Daniels dominates, giving the best perfromance of his life in an oscar candidate performance.
I:12850;236;Laura Linney is also great as are the child actors.
I:12850;237;Ann Paquin is good but William Baldwin steals the show when he's on screen.
I:12850;238;the way that Walt only aggrees with his dad is hilarious.
I:12850;239;the movie is funny, very funny but is also sad.
I:12850;240;the movie is excellent, a powerful piece of genius with some of the best acting of the year.
I:12850;241;This movie is simply fantastic.
I:12850;242;It's common in literature and film alike.
I:12850;243;beat perspective with some particulars added for individuality.
I:12850;244;This movie's strengths are two.
I:12850;245;fold: First, the actors are perfect for the roles they occupy and second, the details make it a believable.
I:12850;246;Anna Paquin and Halley Feiffer fill in the roles of romantic interests for Daniels and Eisenberg, and also add their own special excitement.
I:12850;247;this cast is unexpectedly amazing.
I:12850;248;The dialog and chemistry between the characters is remarkable and the peculiarities and mannerisms exhibited by each are spot.
I:12850;249;With such complex characters, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Daniels and Eisenberg, who I feel were risky castings.
I:12850;250;Kline was also remarkably convincing for such an odd character.
I:12850;251;in addition to the superb acting, the details that are sprinkled throughout the movie add a bit of realism to the whole thing.
I:12850;252;But with such lovely characters that deserved proper conclusion, I feel this was a major miss by production.
I:12850;253;Sound and smell, absolutely accurate.
I:12850;254;most films (Woody Allen's come to mind) that skewer the New York intellectual do so in a charming, endearing way, chuckling at the foibles and oddities of delightful people who should not have paired up.
I:12850;255;But the truth is laid bare here.
I:12850;256;Thank goodness, if this film is indeed autobiographical, that Noah Baumbach seems to have survived.
I:12850;257;The Squid and the Whale is a fantastic portrayal of the ultimate dysfunctional family and it challengers it's viewers to examine how the characters are behaving and check to see if relating to the film is a little easier than it seems.
I:12850;258;with all of the sequels and prequels of existing movies and ideas floating around lately it was essential for a movie like this one to come around and keep this year a respectable one for films.
I:12850;259;He achieved this by becoming Bernard, a slipping writer whose opinions and temper are present throughout this amazing film.
I:12850;260;This movie is so great simply because it is real.
I:12850;261;There are people like Bernard out there and this where this movie gets it's entertainment value.
I:12850;262;This is simply put one of the best films of the year.
I:12850;263;While watching this film you will experience: hate, love, lust, rage, victory, defeat and the best movie experience around right now.
I:12850;264;"though there are other movies out there right now that remain realistic and stray from Hollywood norms, such as ""Broken Flowers"" or ""Closer,"" The Squid and the Whale is simply the most entertaining and original one."
I:12850;265;The rest of the film depicts the impact of that decision on the children and on themselves.
I:12850;266;Both talk openly, graphically and detachedly about sex, including affairs and near.
I:12850;267;In a family of outsized personalities, the children become self.
I:12850;268;But the film does a wonderful job of making these fallible creatures into more than caricatures.
I:12850;269;"The language and sexual content do not make this movie a candidate for ""family film night,"" but it is certainly worth watching."
I:12850;270;Jeff Daniel certainly is making some great career choices lately, kinda like George Clooney.
I:12850;271;I believe the relevance of the revealing biographical fiction will tip Squid towards the judges this year, though Matchpoint is a masterpiece in screenwriting.
I:12850;272;It is certainly one of my favorites this year in its freshness.
I:12850;273;I loved the chemestry between Linney and Daniels, and the hilarious dividing of the family.
I:12850;274;One child, fiercely protective of his fathers image and the younger of his mother.
I:12850;275;The film is filled with ironic humor and at times can be chillingly touching.
I:12850;276;This is one movie that fullfills, and is one to remember.
I:12850;277;Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are great.
I:12850;278;It like the lead actors so I thought it would be a good movie to have.
I:12850;279;If yes, you may find this film provides a clear.
I:12850;280;eyed look at the rupturing of a family through divorce.
I:12850;281;for me, the most compelling storyline in this film was the coming of age tale of sixteen.year.
I:12850;282;So I would say yes, definitely well worth a viewing.
I:12850;283;"But ""Squid"" seems sincerely to believe that it has something new, and vital, and most of all VERY DEEP to share with us."
I:12850;284;Yes, this is a movie about a divorce.
I:12850;285;There are also sexual themes that are discussed in this movie.
I:12850;286;If that sounds like something you want to see, then by all means, watch this movie.
I:12850;287;The dialogue is downright outstanding with extrememley emotional and powerful acting by the entire cast including Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, Jessie Eisenberg, and Owen Kline.
I:12850;288;The dialogue infact is so realistic that you can actually feel the hair raising tension between Jeff Daniel and Laura Linney.
I:12850;289;He cannot handle his stellar career and engages in a new relationship with one of his students Lili (Anna Paquin, I promise you he does not assist her with any birds) Despite the movies short length clocking in at just about 90 minutes, it is well paced, and the characters are well developed, infact, there are so well developed that you almost want to get know them more.
I:12850;290;All in all excellent cast extrodinary script.
I:12850;291;The Squid and the Whale gives an honest portrayal of a long.
I:12850;292;identities and sexuality are changing and/or being discovered.
I:12850;293;The plot line is refreshingly simple without antics or drama but the honest telling of a divorce story.
I:12850;294;It entertained me, if only in some peeping.
I:12850;295;the ending was supposed to be deep, in one of those David Lynch breeds with Sofia Coppola type of sophistocated ways, but it lacked both creativity and any form of compelling thought.
I:12850;296;The Royal Tannebaums kicks it's ass in terms of quirky humor.
I:12850;297;A piercing, intelligent look at a high.
I:12850;298;autobiographical comedy transcends the clich s of the divorce drama for an unflinching portrait of four oddballs mired together in the crazy glue of family.
I:12850;299;"Tender and ingratiating one moment, caustic and cynical the next, ""Squid"" is a small marvel that redefines what's meant by ""family film""."
I:12850;300;Very crude subject matter and cursing, but otherwise interesting storyline, great characters, and exceptionally well acted.
I:12850;301;I might recommend this movie selectively.
I:12850;302;there's no hope in such form of family structure.
I:12850;303;this is a wonderfully casted, script, directed and acted little film.
I:12850;304;I sure see the overratings piling up here.
I:12850;305;but the cast is phenomenal.
I:12850;306;He is made to do things that should be illegal in film making.
I:12850;307;although a bit of a quirky movie, it's simple and fun and the actors are awesome!
I:12850;308;Great story and plain fun
I:12850;309;now the tables have turned some twenty years later, and now Joan is the successful writer and Bernard is the one with no career.
I:12850;310;The movie has some problems (the dad's affair with a student could have been handled better), but it is an excellent achievement in film.
I:12850;311;the movie has been playing in limited release, and it is definitely worth hunting down.
I:12850;312;The most surprising is Jeff Daniels playing brilliantlyagainst type as a boorish intellectual bully, but Laura Linney, Jessie Eisenberg and evenyoung Owen Kline all create heart.
I:12850;313;the film is very well, if simply, shot, given it's tiny budget.
I:12850;314;this is a story where no one comes out as all hero or all villain, and there's a very, veryrare ring of truth to the tremendous complexities of family relationships.
I:12850;315;noah Baumbach has created one of the most haunting, disturbing portraits of theAmerican family in recent years.
I:12850;316;This kind of surprised me, but then I realized that many of the films that I love separate the viewing public with passionate supporters versus equally irate detractors.
I:12850;317;A film that can provoke such strong emotion either way is doing something right.
I:12850;318;I took a friend to see it who is much more into mainstream films, and they liked it quite well.
I:12850;319;"without a doubt, ""The Squid and the Whale"" boasts one of the smartest, most literate, and scathingly funny screenplays I have seen in a long while."
I:12850;320;It is a pitch perfect war of words.
I:12850;321;They are pompous, superior, unkind to one another and frankly not that likable.
I:12850;322;But what we get here is a blistering look at relationships and dysfunction.
I:12850;323;But the humor is abundant.
I:12850;324;I laughed almost nonstop watching this film.
I:12850;325;jeff Daniels, an actor I've always been somewhat apathetic about, gives the best performance of his career.
I:12850;326;He should have given up nice guy roles long ago if this is the result.
I:12850;327;Laura Linney is great, as always.
I:12850;328;"Bernard (Jeff Daniels) was once a successful novelist
I:12850;329;And she's been having multiple love affairs for years.
I:12850;330;provoking and sobering look at divorce.
I:12850;331;The four leads are uniformly brilliant.
I:12850;332;Linney is also excellent playing an evolving wife and mother.
I:12850;333;The boys who play the sons really steal the show.
I:12850;334;The movie was filmed on location in Brooklyn and Manhattan and has a very real, urban feel to it.
I:12850;335;The final scene in the Natural History Museum is the perfect ending to a very satisfying movie.
I:12850;336;I believe that we should now officially declare the quirky indie film as a genre.
I:12850;337;And yet despite the formulaic approach I feel these films are unfortunately falling prey to, I still feel that as far as formulaic genres go, this group of films are still among the most interesting and enjoyable being made.
I:12850;338;, but it also has the ability, much like an Anderson film, to often have me roaring with laughter or warmly smiling at its more tender moments.
I:12850;339;the film, like most quirky indie movies, is very well written.
I:12850;340;The dialogue is sharp as it both celebrates the intellectualism that the family revels in, while criticizing the way in which it can become an emotional shield, especially for the father.
I:12850;341;The film is also hilarious at moments, with my biggest laugh.
I:12850;342;so while originality points may be lost as the film easily falls into the `quirky indie film' genre that must now be recognized, it still manages to do what all of films of this genre do: make us laugh, think, and maybe even get a little emotional from time to time.
I:12850;343;This one perhaps even accomplishes this a little better then most.
I:12850;344;Good writing and great acting come together to make this a good film.
I:12850;345;and is a successful writer who has gone into teaching college students the craft of writing.
I:12850;346;He is so caught up with teaching and his own ego as a successful writer that puts his own writing on the back burner.
I:12850;347;Her book is eventually published and very well received much to the husband's dismay!We see the birdseye view of how the divorce effects not only the adults but how their children react to the divorce as well.
I:12850;348;Highly recommend watching this movie.
I:12850;349;Actors Jesse Eisenberg, as the older son, and Owen Kline, as the younger, portray them to perfection, and Anna Paquin and Billy Baldwin turn in great cameos as well.
I:12850;350;Halley Pfeiffer is perfect as an awkward teenager who's sort of taken with Eisenberg.
I:12850;351;an exhibit that has long captured the imagination of the older child.
I:12850;352;the film is a movie of incidents, of moments.
I:12850;353;But you'll probably enjoy the moments for what they are.
I:12850;354;"day cars can be seen on the streets
I:12850;355;hearted to enjoy on date night with some good popcorn, then look elsewhere.
I:12850;356;if you're looking for a moving, gritty film that will likely change you, watch The Squid and the Whale.
I:12850;357;this raw tale tells the story of a rapidly disintegrating family in New York in the 1980's.
I:12850;358;starring Jeff Daniels, who bides his time convincing himself he's wonderful, while simultaneously grasping for every last bit of respect he can garner from his family.
I:12850;359;this is one of my favorite movies.
I:12850;360;But I felt for the characters played by Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline.
I:12850;361;As Bernard Berkman, a formerly successful and renowned writer.
I:12850;362;at the same time there is a large dollop of dark humor here, revealing the smarts and humor of the writer.
I:12850;363;The ending is a fitting tribute to the title of the film which refers, perhaps, to the couple themselves.
I:12850;364;One of the best American films of the year so far.
I:12850;365;I work with lots of dysfunctional families and I've seen a few like this one.
I:12850;366;The Squid and the Whale, written and directed by Noah Baumbach, is an unusually realistic, well.
I:12850;367;acted and honest film about a dysfunctional Brooklyn family in the 1980s.
I:12850;368;Firstly, these are people who pride themselves on their sophistication and aesthetic approach to life, so they consider themselves above bourgeois morality.
I:12850;369;The children, Walt and Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline, who also give great performances) are somewhat more disturbed than average adolescents.
I:12850;370;"For example, he calls Kafka ""one of my predecessors."""
I:12850;371;There is a dark hilarity to the situation, helped along by Joan and Bernard's obtuseness.
I:12850;372;One of the best films about family life that has come along in years.
I:12850;373;the story was pretty good however and Bridges and Linney were phenominal.
I:12850;374;She is just starting a successful writing career and has moved on from being supportive wife to a strong independent woman.
I:12850;375;This is based on a story by Noah Baubach and is a honest look at the disintigration of a marriage.
I:12850;376;for their two children it is a traumatic revealing time.
I:12850;377;are stuck with moving back and forth from their mother and father's homes.
I:12850;378;The oldest boy realizes his mother, though flawed, provided comfort and stability for him, and maybe divorce is best for her.
I:12850;379;dropping the works of great writers (without having read them).
I:12850;380;There is a bit of the comic in the way in which the boys adopt Bernard's mannerisms, and you can just feel Baumbach's self.
I:12850;381;for her turn, the mother, Joan, has rebelled against her marriage by quietly evolving her own writing career and in extra.
I:12850;382;kind of like the tennis that is a motif in the film.
I:12850;383;i think, as a sidenote, this is the best acting Jeff Daniels has ever done.
I:12850;384;I don't know how Laura Lindley does it but I can always count on her being in a great independent film.
I:12850;385;This one is wonderful though I still can't make sense of the ending.
I:12850;386;She finds other men to date and the father takes up with one of his college students.
I:12850;387;I would love to know who is the squid or the whale.
I:12850;388;Noah Baumbach strikes back after a somewhat of a failure with co. writing Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, with one of the year's strangest, but funny, films.
I:12850;389;Seeing as how it is autobiographical, I guess I can see the sincerity and seriousness of the story.
I:12850;390;These scenes really detract from my overall perspective of the film, and a simple explanation of what has been going on should have sufficed, but nevertheless, I tried to keep an open mind about the rest of the film, and it really pays off.
I:12850;391;There are great supporting performances, like Joan's tennis pro boyfriend (who also coaches Frank) played by William Baldwin, and the fiesty Lili (Anna Paquin) who moves in with Bernard.
I:12850;392;It's really a great coming of age story, although I don't think most people would have had a coming of age like this one.
I:12850;393;I like the directing, I like the writing, and I like the acting.
I:12850;394;It's really the biggest sleeper movie of 2005.
I:12850;395;In its oblique way, Noah Baumbach's beautifully acted, painful.
I:12850;396;He published critically successful novels in the past but can't even find an agent for his most recent effort.
I:12850;397;Your mother would never have thought of writing if it hadn't been for me, Bernard tells his sons, insisting on his share of credit for her success, even though Joan, like Bernard, has a Ph. d in literature.
I:12850;398;shortly after the tennis match, Bernard and Joan unsurprisingly tell their sons they will be separating and they will share joint custody.
I:12850;399;The Squid and the Whale offers a career.
I:12850;400;best performance from Jeff Daniels as the obnoxious yet egg.
I:12850;401;The script and storytelling are finely wrought and heartfelt.
I:12850;402;It helps that Baumbach assembled a highly talented group of actors to bring the Berkman family to life.
I:12850;403;also of note is the script.
I:12850;404;Although it's mainly a dramatic film, there are plenty of hysterical moments.
I:12850;405;"I loved Bernard's dismissal of A TALE OF TWO CITIES as little more than a ""minor work"", and Walt's comment about Kafka's THE METAMORPHOSIS being Kafka."
I:12850;406;I don't mind endings that tie up every loose end, but sometimes it's good to use your imagination.
I:12850;407;there's some fantastic music used in this film.
I:12850;408;There are songs from Pink Floyd, The Cars, Lou Reed, and Loudon Wainwright III.
I:12850;409;paced at times (despite a running time of 81 minutes), THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a well.
I:12850;410;The performances alone make this picture worth watching.
I:12850;411;i forgot how many times, cant remember right now.
I:12850;412;It's good drama and I recommend it for Daniels, Baldwin and Linney fans
I:12850;413;Few movies have captured the realiy of divorce and its effects as subtly and realistically as THE SQUID AND THE WHALE.
I:12850;414;Writer/director Noah Baumbusch has created a family torn apart by a divorce and its beautifully acted by Jeff Daniels as the self.
I:12850;415;A good and provocative film.
I:12850;416;"Noah Baumbach's ""The Squid and the Whale"" is a funny, touching, harrowing film about the damage family members do to each other during and after a divorce."
I:12850;417;two adversaries of equal power, with equal right on their side.
I:12850;418;Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), their elder son, is vociferously his father's son, parroting his father's opinions on literature, women and life, while younger son Frank (Owen Kline) is more quietly but just as firmly his mother's son.
I:12850;419;Daniels, Linney, Eisenberg and Kline all give performances that can fairly be described as perfect.
I:12850;420;"Even if you yourself are not a divorcee or a child of divorce, you will find that ""The Squid and the Whale"" is filled with funny, painful emotional truth."
I:12850;421;"overrated independent flicks to come out in years
I:12850;422;Jesus, can you beat that into our heads one more time, please?
I:12850;423;Jeff Daniels gives what should become the definitive portrait of a snobby, self.
I:12850;424;important novelist in The Squid and the Whale.
I:12850;425;This move is dark, but also funny, usually both at the same time (e. g., when Daniels tags along on his son's date).
I:12850;426;This is also one of those movies which 'shows you' rather than 'tells you.
I:12850;427;"I suspect this is the influence of Wes Anderson and his ""here's what's on my IPod"" style of direction."
I:12850;428;The tunes are good, but don't always seem necessary.
I:12850;429;And be forewarned, it definitely earned its R rating.
I:12850;430;And then we have a splendid performance for young Jesse Eisenburg.
I:12850;431;Gifted even at this younger age this movie really stick with you when you watch it.
I:12850;432;Clever dialouge and very real and raw emotion.
I:12850;433;This movie is capturing the period during these hardships, NOT the resolving or moving on after.
I:12850;434;As far as the modern family structure is concerned, I think our model has changed.
I:12850;435;"modern"" family is perhaps the nuclear family of the 50's, husband and wife, forever married
I:12850;436;With a window, offered by Noah Baumbach's vision, to the life and times of a semi.
I:12850;437;eccentric academic Brooklyn family, the Berkmans, the viewer gets a picture of what it is like for a family to move from the pre.
I:12850;438;The vision is flinchingly honest, emotionally crippling to all involved, and frankly not pretty what a family goes through moving from stability to divorce.
I:12850;439;"baumbach gets all sorts of good performances from the acting troupe that pulls off ""The Squid and The Whale."""
I:12850;440;Jeff Daniels is extremely spot.
I:12850;441;Her performance as one part loving mother, one.
I:12850;442;long polygamist, is so believable as to think you know her living in your own community (and kind of wish you were the tennis instructor played very humorously by William Baldwin).
I:12850;443;the power of the story is the emotional toil the break.
I:12850;444;"ultimately ""The Squid and the Whale,"" is a worthy watch."
I:12850;445;Upon hearing reviews and the movie being heralded as the best of the year and one of the better of all.
I:12850;446;director Noah Baumbach presents an interesting, somewhat comical look at the effects of divorce with minimal Hollywood glitz.
I:12850;447;"Kramer vs. Kramer this is not
I:12850;448;Often the humor is a by.
I:12850;449;jeff Daniels's portrayal of the academic father, Bernard Berkman, is very good, perhaps his best performance yet.
I:12850;450;What was truly remarkable about this particular film was its incredible verbal potency.
I:12850;451;while Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney both give the performances of their lives, the most moving performance of this awkard ensemble cast of sorts came from that of Owen Kline (Frank) who plays the younger son.
I:12850;452;This young actor tackled an incredibly complex role with the skill of a veteran.
I:12850;453;Even Jeff Daniels, an excellent actor, couldn't save this flick.
I:12850;454;If you're interested in compelling drama, and what makes characters tick, see Pleasantville.
I:12850;455;I found this film to be one of the most essentially compelling films I have seen in a very long time.
I:12850;456;The acting is flawless and the writing is impeccable.
I:12850;457;After all, critical buzz about the picture when it was released was good, and the film was nominated for some Golden Globes and and Oscar.
I:12850;458;The children naturally find themselves taking sides.
I:12850;459;what IS good about the film .
I:12850;460;all the performances are great, with Daniels in particular fully inhabiting Bernard's academic elitism and utter vanity.
I:12850;461;Bernard is just always so sure he's right about everything.
I:12850;462;The Bottom Line:Much better at focusing on character than plot or narrative, The Squid and the Whale is an interesting film which breezes through its short running length and showcases a handful of perfect performances.
I:12850;463;He constantly makes references to literary works he believes are valid, and he teaches creative writing, but none of his comments have any intrinsic value: it's just what he personally likes or dislikes.
I:12850;464;much of this film is like the 'Wonder Boys' without the charm, humour, humanity, surprise and interesting dialogue.
I:12850;465;It's a classic example of how up its own arse so much artsy film.
I:12850;466;For instance, here the press slaughtered, and continues to do so, Gary Glitter, a pop star who was found to have thousands of pictures of child porn on his computer.
I:12850;467;Contrast that with Benjamin Britten, a classical composer.
I:12850;468;But his music is still played, his reputation intact.
I:12850;469;this film is a good example of how double standards apply, both morally and artistically, under the banner of 'art'.
I:12850;470;the heart of this movie is in the right place, empathizing with the lost adolescents.
I:12850;471;It's pessimistic, and it isn't pretty, but it offers some acutely truthful observations about human nature.
I:12850;472;Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson grew up together as equals, thus could compliment each other's skills for a well.
I:12850;473;in terms of the writing, it's amazing, and the performances help.
I:12850;474;For all necessary terms of Baumbach's creativity and mood, this film is an excellent visualization and definitely shows his talent.
I:12850;475;The production style of this film is a lot like Anderson's, the sort of perpendicular pastel colors of the set and the long, deep focus lens.
I:12850;476;held camera effect, making a disorganized camera try to exist amidst a completely organized space.
I:12850;477;Now I love Anderson's work a lot, but for the purposes of Baumbach's own visualization and imagination I wish he'd drop everything he learned from Anderson and start figuring out how to make a film himself.
I:12850;478;On a literate level, this movie is above and beyond a lot of other stuff out there.
I:12850;479;This movie is really good, in many ways.
I:12850;480;The most remarkable thing is that kid, (Owen Kline??)
I:12850;481;It's a new world order.
I:12850;482;I bought this movie thinking it would be something me and my kids could enjoy together, then only thing we can enjoy about this movie is dumping into our firepit.
I:12850;483;it's so amazingly well done in all ways: the script, the cinematography, the acting.
I:12850;484;Child performers so often seem way too precocious (think Dakota Fanning), but these two young men do an outstanding job of portraying the children of two confused adults and showing how this confusion infects their lives and personalities.
I:12850;485;provoking, touching, realistic view of the darker side of family life, give this movie a viewing.
I:12850;486;if I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars.
I:12850;487;At least, I hope it's only a few.)

I:12850;492;"Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are always forces to be reckoned with
I:12850;493;Enjoyable support from William Baldwin and Anna Paquin are fine.
I:12850;494;There's no discernable plot, but it's a wonderful display of a period in the life of a dying marriage and the affect on the kids.
I:12850;495;I'll be first in line to see Mr. Baumbach's next project (which stars his wife, the very under.

I:12850;497;"Running at 81 minutes, ""The Squid and the Wale"" is unique to most Hollywood films."
I:12850;498;A divorce is a family tragedy but here it is treated with just the right amount of comedy, to stray the film away from melodrama.
I:12850;499;This is due to the realism of the film.
I:12850;500;Realism in accordance with witty humor is what makes the film so enjoyable.
I:12850;501;The casting is perfect and the characters are unique and genuine.
I:12850;502;"I recommend ""The Squid and the Whale"" to anyone, but if you especially like independent features, realism, and wit, than this is definitely for you."

I:12850;506;It has shattered the lives of several of my closest friends in truly fightening ways.
I:12850;507;I think this is one of the better dramas I have seen on it, painful and unresolved, with great empathy for all the characters and in the end uplifting if heavy: they all move on in their owns ways, if wounded.
I:12850;508;You can believe the pain in the children's eyes and though their acts, in fill adolescence and awakening sexuality.
I:12850;509;The mother, who could not go on the way it was, is indulging her need for a kind of simple lover, disastrously choosing her son's tennis teacher.
I:12850;510;"That makes this a superb indie film in this way, up there with ""We Don't Live Here Anymore."""
I:12850;511;Naturally the critics loved it.
I:12850;512;head tennis pro, gets it right .
I:12850;513;finally, the film resorts to the technique popular in the '60s and '70s .
I:12850;514;This is so far from Hollywood and deserves a wide audience.

I:12850;517;Much of the tension between the husband and wife comes from Bernard's inability to accept this turn of events.
I:12850;518;"The film does a fine job showing the emotional toll divorce takes on children as they often become helpless pawns in the power struggles waged by the two ""combatants."
I:12850;519;The performances by the four leads are superb down to the smallest detail, and they receive fine support from Halley Feiffer, Anna Paquin and William Baldwin in lesser but still crucial roles.
I:12850;520;The Squid and the Whale barely runs 80 minutes, and although it could possibly use a bit more development of character and theme, the movie still manages to pack a great deal of insight and observation into that short time period, making it one of the most interesting movies about family relationships that we've come across in quite some time.
I:12850;521;This is one of the movies that'll stick with you for a few days.
I:12850;522;But at least watch it for yourself and see how you feel.
I:12850;523;The younger Frank proves unreceptive to his father, so Bernard pretty much ignores him.

I:12850;525;academic backgrounds of the characters, references to arty movies, scenes in which characters who make critical decisions after a period of self.
I:12850;526;I absolutely loved this film.
I:12850;527;The plot line is simple (certainly one that has shown up many times before) but the subject is handled well with wit and humor.
I:12850;528;Definitely a film everyone should see if they get the chance (especially if you're a lover of literature!)
I:12850;529;"Noah Baumbach's fictional memoir, ""The Squid and The Whale,"" knows that, and treats its characters."

I:12850;532;She and Walt both tail around Bernard waiting for the verbal scraps he mindlessly passes as wisdom.
I:12850;533;but Daniels is the fit.
I:12850;534;And Linney, in an equally skilled performance, diminishes our sympathy for Joan, who indulges her awakening at the expense of her children.
I:12850;535;She is a shadow of the mother she once was, and maybe knows it.
I:12850;536;"Eisenberg and Kline deliver Baumbach's lines like they know they're funny, although Eisenberg played a similiar role in Dylan Kidd's excellent ""Rodger Dodger."""
I:12850;537;The four are fine independently, clever coupled together and excellent when in a quartet.
I:12850;538;But here he has the cast, the back.

I:12850;540;He's directed a seriously funny picture, one of the best from last year.
I:12850;541;i thought Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney were wonderful.
I:12850;542;important jerk and he makes my skin crawl, which is the mark Daniels played the character well.
I:12850;543;I feel like the part was well played, but I just wanted to punch the kid every time he ridiculed his mother or obsessively loved his father because of his extreme short.
I:12850;544;I use this film in my Conflict Communication class and we have wonderful discussions on the first 9 minutes of it!
I:12850;545;Very real dialogue and performances.
I:12850;546;This is a comedy of manners, about people who get divorced and about the effect on their children.
I:12850;547;I found it very powerful, and memorable.
I:12850;548;And, quite funny in places.
I:12850;549;The Berkmans are like Brooklyn, close enough to the greatness of Manhattan to feel self.
I:12850;550;Bernard sees himself as a great novelist, having written one well.
I:12850;551;"This entitles her to tell her children, ""I need some nights away from you guys, okay!"
I:12850;552;The boys, naturally, take sides.
I:12850;553;Joan is slightly successful and selfish.
I:12850;554;term storage, is best left for you to discover .
I:12850;555;the title of the movie refers to a lonely happy memory in the life of one of the boys.
I:12850;556;"It's actually one of the best ""feel."
I:12850;557;"This film has this funny sense of humor that makes you think when watching it, ""should I be laughing at this"" but thats what makes it so original."
I:12850;558;It was great to see the Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels charactor refected in their kids in this movie.
I:12850;559;Above all this is a great film that deserves to be on the years best.
I:12850;560;Laura Linney is his wife, Joan Berkman, with a burgeoning writing career of her own that has riled the jealousy of Bernard.
I:12850;561;Despite the despicability of his character, we can still sympathize with Bernard because, in his own way, he manages to be both.
I:12850;562;I think that is true of all of us, at times.
I:12850;563;"She is willing to take her part of the blame, while Bernard continues to believe ""It's not my fault."""
I:12850;564;It really hits home with the divorce and the fight over the kids.
I:12850;565;Daniels, channeling Flap from Terms of Endearment is quite good, but he's done this material before.
I:12850;566;Maybe it's best the movie ended as it did, maybe we didnt want to see what becomes of this fractured family.
I:12850;567;Not sure id recommend it, but if you like Wes Anderson, you'll probably be just fine with this film.
I:12850;568;Still, Daniels and Linney are two really good actors, who should probably be considered for major awards.
I:12850;569;It's funny, at times, in that bittersweet we're all flawed Indie film sort of way.
I:12850;570;This is a finely crafted family drama, great perfomance's from the whole cast.
I:12850;571;I will always tell it like I see it.
I:12850;572;all he does is whine about everything and bark orders at her and make fun of her ,so she starts seeing other men.
I:12850;573;he tells the children about the affairs in detail, so the kids will want to stay with him.
I:12850;574;walt, is shocked and angered by the whole thing.
I:12850;575;"he also brags to the whole school,that he wrote ""Hey You"" by Pink Floyd, which is absolutely hilarious , because that is just absurd that people would not realize he was making it up."
I:12850;576;There is a lot of great musical selections in it.
I:12850;577;His humor made this heavy handed movie bearable.
I:12850;578;It was nice to see Jeff Daniels with a full beard out of his likable,but dumb character phase.
I:12850;579;I don't care what anyone says, but Laura Linney was great as the mother, Joan.
I:12850;580;I hope he keeps writing.
I:12850;581;he understands the human condition.
I:12850;582;all in all this a good movie.
I:12850;583;There are scenes inthe movie that are devastating and made to seem so real they will break your heart and make youcringe.
I:12850;584;I'm not a collector of movies, but every once in a while a movie is just so good I have to own it.
I:12850;585;Noah Baumbach did a fantastic job writing the quirky characters and their eccentric language.
I:12850;586;there is a lot of similarity between Baumbach's style and that of Wes Anderson, which can be credited to Anderson's producing this particular film (Baumbach also co. wrote Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou).
I:12850;587;"It is a very serious film, but it treats the subject in a way I can only describe as ""real."""
I:12850;588;Anderson makes films that are normal things, but they're funny things, and Baumbach has this in Squid perfectly.
I:12850;589;All that work I did at the end of our marriage, making dinners, cleaning up, being more attentive.
I:12850;590;I made burgers that time you had pneumonia.
I:12850;591;But the ending is still very strong and powerful.
I:12850;592;This is a painfully honest film about divorce.
I:12850;593;Subtle yet wicked black humor and poignant drama abound in this uncomfortably entertaining film about a dysfunctional family.
I:12850;594;The backlashes and responses the kids express are integral parts of the movie as well.
I:12850;595;i'm going to give it all away.
I:12850;596;maybe it's that I'm conditioned to see the story end in some sort of climactic way.
I:12850;597;The dialogue was intelligent and at times funny.
I:12850;598;Jeff Daniels gave an exceptional performance, as well did the rest of the main cast.
I:12850;599;At times I laughed, at other times I thought, 'What the F.?'
I:12850;600;It was an enjoyable flick.
I:12850;601;It lacked some common plot devices, also lacked a strong 'deep' message to pull off this plot.
I:12850;602;"The acting is good
I:12850;603;Laura Linney is good as the mother who has to struggle to regain her kids' confidence.
I:12850;604;The acting is fine in this film, as many reviewers have said.
I:12850;605;So enough said about that!In some ways this film reminds me of another well.
I:12850;606;acted film about a dysfunctional family, Ordinary People (1980).
I:12850;607;I thought it odd that the older boy met with a counselor while the younger boy did not.
I:12850;608;It seemed clear enough that Walt was just beginning to come to grips with himself and his family, with the help of the counselor.
I:12850;609;This film had the courage, I will say, to show how kids can be affected by what is going on around them.
I:12850;610;I certainly could name a lot of semi.
I:12850;611;popular songs from seven years ago which my father had never heard.
I:12850;612;"and the film maker keeps this ""revelation"" just as unspoken as these beautifully performed characters do."
I:12850;613;"this film is so well made that you ""get it"" without even knowing how you ""got it""."
I:12850;614;its presentation is important in order to get across the gravity of the characters situation.
I:12850;615;it has some cool cinematography and editing too.
I:12850;616;On the plus side, it's fun watching the youngest son swear and drink beer, there's a cool soundtrack, and the movie is mercifully short.
I:12850;617;Jeff Daniels shows his incredible acting range by playing a self.
I:12850;618;centered, egotistical, novelist past his creative prime (and seemingly in mid.
I:12850;619;The couples' children are deeply emotionally scarred .
I:12850;620;Came neatly packaged and in swift time.
I:12850;621;More of an adult dark humorous film than my other cartoon choices.
I:12850;622;I bought this movie based on the trailer which made it look like a hilarious family comedy.
I:12850;623;I was quite surprised, unplesasantly so, when I watched it and found it to be a dark, morose and depressing story.
I:12850;624;Save your money, this one is a good example of a movie that should never have been made.
I:12850;625;Daniels and Linney were good .
I:12850;626;the younger son, for example, but it works without more.
I:12850;627;promising novelist turned college writing teacher Bernard, and a newly successful writer Joan .
I:12850;628;"This ""happy"" memory provides the basis for the film's title."
I:12850;629;When I saw the trailer for this I thought, 'Wow!
I:12850;630;i liked the film a lot.
I:12850;631;Laura Linney has a quiet resolve to survive no matter what her husband pulls, while Jeff Daniels is a bully that would never admit to the complicity in his life.
I:12850;632;He repeats himself as if he's hit upon the greatest wisdom with his cliches.
I:12850;633;Yet you can see why his son sides with him throughout the movie.
I:12850;634;this is a great movie full of original and disturbing characters (I haven't mentioned Owen Kline's turn as a nasty 12.
I:12850;635;and well worth your time and money.
I:12850;636;THE SQUID AND THE WHALE tells a simple story.
I:12850;637;His son Walt, played by Jesse Eisenberg, believes in his father's greatness and takes his side in the divorce.
I:12850;638;Much of the humor of the film is based on Bernard's pompous personality and young Walt imitating the father he finds to be so great.
I:12850;639;The youngest son Frank, played by Owen Kline adds some comic relief and in some ways, it is through his actions we see how deeply pained Walt and Frank are by the divorce.
I:12850;640;the dialogue in this film is outstanding, and the acting is superb.
I:12850;641;Jeff Daniels is convincing as the once brilliant lout, and Jesse Eisenberg will have a career to watch.
I:12850;642;The conflicts raised in the film are not resolved, or at least not in the usual sense, but in a way this gives the film a realistic edge.
I:12850;643;For now it will play to film lovers who will find it entertaining, but like so many wonderful films, it will take a nomination or two for it to be noticed.
I:12850;644;I happened to find it interesting and even touching, but it also features a set of characters, well.
I:12850;645;putting, but the film's insightful observations about people are genuine and delicately shown.
I:12850;646;the whole process before and after the divorce, and the two boys' reactions to it are both depicted with downbeat humor mixed with references to classic literature and pop culture.
I:12850;647;"The name of ""New Yorker"" is impressive enough for the father who habitually uses his literary knowledge as weapon to dismiss others (including his wife and her books) as second."
I:12850;648;by the time the two boys (and we) come to know the true reasons for the divorce and joint custody, we realize that the film is realistic and convincing in details describing the human nature seen in someone very close to us without making us too conscious of the narrative skills and clever script.
I:12850;649;For a movie that focuses on a pretty overdone plot, it's highly intelligent and well.
I:12850;650;Sure, it's not a blockbuster film, nor is it the most entertaining movie in the world.
I:12850;651;This movie in my opinion is very appealing, intelligent, and refreshing.
I:12850;652;This is a type of movie for those who want to watch films without all the hype, special affects, big name actors, etc.
I:12850;653;"Completely overlooked at the Oscars, ""The Squid and the Whale"" features two of the strongest performances of 2005 from Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney and a powerful script."
I:12850;654;it's more a series of events, much like life, strung together with the emotional turmoil of the story driving the story forward.
I:12850;655;a sharp extremely good transfer is a major highlight for this film.
I:12850;656;Atmospheric effects are nicely placed around the speakers.
I:12850;657;noah Baumbach provides an intelligent observant commentary track full of trivia about the shooting of the movie and the performances in the film.
I:12850;658;scenes featurette is pretty good as well with some thoughtful comments from the actors.
I:12850;659;"a terrific, emotional powerful film that touches on the victims of divorce, ""The Squid and the Whale"" probably had the worst title of any of the films that came out last year which may have impacted its performance with audiences."
I:12850;660;The actors give terrific performances and it's a shame that the Academy Awards chose to overlook these performances.
I:12850;661;In fact, she would talk about them with her kids!
I:12850;662;the acting is good and it's only 81 minutes.
I:12850;663;The 80 minute film is simply about the aftermath of a divorce on a family.
I:12850;664;a very unique family in some ways, but not unlike any family in others.
I:12850;665;She's most suitable to play real characters in indie films like her signature work in You Can Count On Me.
I:12850;666;It's clear that Linney has once again returned to her Indie roots by starring in The Squid and the Whale, and she truly delivered another Oscar.
I:12850;667;This film features probably Jeff Daniel's career.
I:12850;668;best performance, and he had a great deal of chemistry working opposite Linney and the young actors.
I:12850;669;It's a great film about the impact on a family post divorce.
I:12850;670;She's also becoming an acclaimed writer when she's gets her own book published, so it instantly caused Bernard to be very jealous.
I:12850;671;They shared custody of the two boys, and it's clear that Walt(Einsberg) has a stronger bond with Bernard, while the younger son Frank is closed to Mommy.
I:12850;672;this film successfully achieves the look of the '80s and the ragged cinematography works perfectly for it's mood.
I:12850;673;The dialogue is interlectually stimulating, and the cast is just perfect.
I:12850;674;I do hope Linney and Daniel will get some acting nominations, and I was very impressed by Owen Wilson's performance.
I:12850;675;He was a total comic relief!
