43;Of all of Fellini's films, this one is the one that most of my friends consider the greatest.
44;I adore it, admire it and consider it a masterpiece.
45;I still feel that `La Strada' and `8 ' are his more accomplished works and the ones that I immediately flock to when longing for some Fellini, but `La Dolce Vita' (appropriately, or shall I say inappropriately translated `The Sweet Life') is an outstanding representation of how advanced foreign cinema is from what we experience here in the states.
46;In 1960 this Italian gem possessed more gusto, more acute sense of realism and more profound intellect than nearly 90% of what we had released stateside.
47;I'm not knocking American cinema (for I love it) but I am also moved by how much more realism and passion is found in foreign releases"
48;He delivers charm, wit, rage, depression, sensuality, hysteria, apathy.
49;he is just marvelous, from top to bottom.
50;this film is a brilliant look at the way life can encompass and conform you, even when you are fighting fervently against that said conformation.
51;One of the most sobering, human, and symbolic ending I have ever seen.
52;The last shot gave the ending a happy note (depending on how you view it) and showed me that there are those who are still passionate and unclouded about life.
53;What I just said could be utter garbage, but it is just a testimony to the power of the film to really captivate and stimulate the mind.
54;I hate to bash Fellini because I do love his films.
55;I was always unsure exactly what I thought of this peek into the lives of the rich and beautiful.
56;"when I finally bought ""Vita"", in an effort to put together a decent collection of Italian films, I watched it as an examination of life."
57;Watching in the manner in which Fellini went on record to explain what motivated him to produce films helped.
58;more than a film about the rich and beautiful, this is a film about the things with which we want to and/or fill our lives.
59;Every once in while we're reminded of the way the other half lives, and what they deem important.
60;"finally, the digital transfer of ""Dolce"" is gorgeous."
61;Her presence spoke volumes, and Marilyn Monroe, in her entire career, had nothing on Anita.
62;"Mastroianni's performance is every bit as good here as it was in ""8 1/2"" but this is a far better film."
63;Indeed, I regard it as Fellini's strongest.
64;Whenever real life intrudes upon the glossy, soma.
65;Their presence sometimes even changes the events they are there to record.
66;His life is sweet only at the surface level.
67;Fellini's message was profound and I hope that future viewers continue to internalize it.
68;Great classic film and one that really shows Fellini in all his glory.
69;It is most certainly on my list.
70;The picture covers an indeterminate number of days in the life of an Italian gossip columnist for, I believe, the International Edition of the Herald.
71;As I was in Rome in 1964 and saw many of the locations where this movie was shot, this great construction effort is quite real.
72;hour movie, the whole point of the movie is the life and experiences of the observer, Marcello.
73;commentators on this movie, Schickel among them, have developed lots of theories about the images, allusions, and statements made, indirectly in the business and dialogue in the movie.
74;clerical message derived from the movie is very real, especially to conservative Europeans.
75;All this means is that these 180 minutes are one of the richest cinematic environments created by any filmmaker.
76;since the movie is in Italian, there are few memorable quotes from the dialogue (although I have an excellent memory of one line, `And to think he played Tarzan', spoken about Lex Barker by one of the paparazzi.
77;Therefore, we are perfectly free to object to his observations.
78;And, there is more than one of his observations with which I find issue.
79;realistic works and his later impressionistic works such as `Satyricon'.
80;I would especially contrast it with Fellini's next film, `8 ', which is often considered his best.
81;this is a truly great movie and I believe it is clearly Fellini's best.
82;It is quite possibly one of the best films ever made.
83;Yes, La Dolce Vita is Fellini's crown jewel, his overindulgent masterpiece.
84;Yet it's definitely not his best work.
85;"I'm sure, viewed in the context of the time of its release, it was shocking with its unblinking eye towards high society or ""the sweet life"" debauchery."
86;It definitely was THE film that really made Fellini's name known worldwide but viewed amongst his oeuvre, La Strada or Amarcord are better.
87;Some segments are really entertaining while others could have been edited for length.
88;There's definitely a lot to dissect here.
89;It truly is a stunning film but I can only watch it in segments instead of straight through.
90;the theme of paparazzi (that phrase as fans of Fellini know was coined from a character in the film) and the fascination with high society culture is even more relevant today than ever before.
91;It's a great starting point for those new to the visually poetic world of Fellini but I can't say it's his best.
92;also: A depiction of a man in the brink of having to chose between saving his life and losing his soul, or giving up his life and saving it.
93;here's your choice, here's you freedom to chose.
94;"Because its takes away that ""burden"" of having to chose, leaving it to a faceless government, an intricate bureaucratic system that regulates your life and decides your future."
95;"Everything is ambiguous, even the title, ""the sweet life"", however bitterseet it really is."
96;The spirit and the flesh.
97;It's easy to love oneself, to give in to the passions of the flesh and the wickedness of our selfishness.
98;That is why I give it 4 stars.
99;"It is not (in my opinion, contrary to the majority of the reviewers in Amazon) as visualy satisfying as other films with less symbolism and ""meat""."
100;i loved the ending, though.
101;Its iconic imagery and the intimacy it elicits despite the scope of its story left a deep impression, making a Fellini admirer out of me for life.
102;is a profound, eye filling, episodically structured film that follows jaded journalist Marcello in his quest to discover something of meaningful, lasting value in life.
103;marcello Mastroianni, the Italian equivalent of Cary Grant, is brilliant as the complex, idealistic hero.
104;Anita Ekberg is also great in her signature role, as a glamorous movie star whose carefree lifestyle masks a troubled relationship with her abusive actor/boyfriend, played by Lex Barker.
105;the film's most famous scene is of Anita Ekberg's sensual cavorting in Rome's Trevi Fountain.
106;This helped make LA DOLCE VITA one of the most relevant, influential films of its time, one that reflected the changing attitudes of European society at the dawn of a new decade.
107;It received the Grand Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and has since been regarded as a cinematic landmark and Fellini's masterpiece.
108;There's a smorgasbord of supplemental material that includes an introduction by director Alexander Payne, an insightful commentary by critic Richard Schickel, a collection of Fellini T. v. shorts, interviews with Fellini, Mastroianni and Ekberg, a musical montage of Cinecitta Studio, a documentary on composer Nino Rota, a discussion on LA DOLCE VITA themes, and footage with the film's screenwriter, Tullio Pinelli.
109;"A 40 page illustrated booklet, five 5""x7"" photos, and an 11""x17"" poster round out this sumptuous package."
110;even though life may not always be so sweet, a classic movie like LA DOLCE VITA can sure add some spice to it.
111;The 3 hour film is visually overpowering with stark Roman cityscapes.
112;The film is intelligent and complex.
113;She is passive dependent, jealous, insecure and extremely beautiful.
114;He is also the boy.
115;toy for rich shallow Maddalena.
116;Maddalenad is beautiful, extremely rich, but distractable, bored, and amoral.
117;Then there is the beautiful Swedish actress Sylvie.
118;She is served by a satyr actor in a open air nightclub romp.
119;She puts stray kittens in her hair, she howls with the dogs, she is beyond domination by any man.
120;multiple characters and situations come and go, all revealing the struggle of Marcello to define himself.
121;In many ways the film was like a dream, scenes linked together in a tentative way.
122;The scenes are full of strangers in stunning Chanel dresses populating a world of decadence.
123;marcello trys to establish honest communication with his playboy father, but is held at arms lenght by this sophisticated lady's man.
124;Marcello idolizes the brilliant talented writer and composer Steiner.
125;Marcellow longs to be a serious writer and he is fascinated by the literary intelligencia that surround Steiner and his beautiful wife.
126;But Steiner's inner demons cause him to kill his children and then commit suicide, depriving Marcello of a mentor and model for stability, respect, and the graceful successful artist.
127;He has finally lost his muse, he is beyond the power of women.
128;The beauty of this grand dream from Fellini is that the interpretations are endless.
129;This film represents Fellini at the pinnacle of his success.
130;8 1/2 is autobiographical and considered the companion piece to this film.
131;The main character is caught up in a web of late nights and early dawns, and there is much symbolism within to ponder.
132;Anita Ekberg's performance and parody of herself is worth the price of admission.
133;The video was in good condition and plays beautifully as well!
134;There are enough reviews of it here to have it agreed.
135;La Dolce is a masterpiece of cinema that no collection of international films can live without.
136;tellers well, but what I love indeed is the inclusion of frame.
137;issued poster and well crafted book (of some 40 pages).
138;I commend the folks at Koch Lorber for thinking this through, allowing the pictures to be so very sturdy while maintaining their beauty.
139;i received this box as a gift, and I plan on giving it as a gift this year to several people I know who will cherish it for years to come.
140;La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life), as ironic a title as has ever been used in motion picture history, Federico Fellini's 1960 film commentary on modern hedonism and anomy, and filmed in 1959 in Rome, may just be the best film in his canon, for it combines the Neo.
141;realism of earlier classics like La Strada and Nights Of Cabiria, while admixing some of the surreal touches of his later classics.
142;Plus, it is the best written and most ambitious of his films.
143;this film is often coupled with its immediate successor film, 8, and usually compared to negatively by most critics.
144;It's the superior film, however, because, despite being even a bit longer, at just about five minutes short of three full hours, there is not any of the fat that could be trimmed from 8.
145;and that can be explained if one really pays attention to the film.
146;Behavior is caused by motivation, and scenes we see of Marcello with other minor characters.
147;The film's screenplay, written by Fellini with Ennio Flaiano, is impressive, not just for its written brilliance, but for the boundaries it pushed open for film as an art form.
148;Nino Rota, as usual, provides a superb musical score.
149;The art direction by Piero Gherardi, and cinematography by Otello Martelli, are all top notch, as well.
150;The acting is first rate.
151;Granted, her acting is not much, but the other females in the film are top notch, and all the supporting cast do well.
152;La Dolce Vita is one of the great works of art by one of the greatest artists of the last century, and in that statement, there's not a hint of irony.
153;Great way to learn Italian.
154;It's wonderful to see the fountain scene although whatshername said she did not speak Italian at the time and there was no chemistry between her and Mastroianni.
155;She lives in Italy now and speaks the language.
156;Fellini presents several existential choices for his main character, Marcello, played by the marvelous Marcello Mastroianni .
157;"an elegant encapsulation of existentialism!So much for my attempt to unpack the film's meaning
158;An excellent B/W film based solely on content, circumstance and dialogue.
159;He must deal with insurmountable problems, continuously, but his hair and suit always look great!
160;world War II European cinema.
161;The movie has visual style to burn, the use of anamorphic composition has rarely been equalled elsewhere, and the idea of offering a panorama of Roman high life through the experiences of a reporter during a few days remains a brilliant inspiration still today.
162;Even Fellini couldn't take himself seriously too long, and the best thing to do is to forget the sermonizing and dig the fabulous party.
163;Oh my, such exquisite symbolism.
164;This is one of THOSE movies!
165;loathing can you take?There are some things worth mentioning.
166;Anita Ekberg stunning to behold, and it includes an interesting performance by a pre.
167;Fellini's other work is otherwise most appreciated.
168;The Ekberg character is an object of fan worship, and ultimately, emptiness.
169;At the end of the movie, he is on the beach and again sees the young woman in the distance, I believe with her family if my memory is correct.
170;I view the ending as one of hope, because the Mastroianni character fully realizes that the beauty and appreciation of life is in innocense and decency rather than debauchery, materialism and empty self.
171;There is hope for this individual.
172;the film's message is still timely.
173;In the 1980s, the public was treated to """"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"""" which attempted to engender envy about the lives of entertainment idols who could afford the best food and retreat to Carribean resorts costing thousands of dollars per night."""
174;i'd recommend this movie to anyone as a reminder of the need, especially at the present time, for a moral compass.
175;This is a movie with a thoughtful aspect.
176;La Dolce Vita is my favorite film of all time, one of the richest film experiences ever.
177;a culture and soul in decline.
178;There are superb visual symbols and illusions, and unlike some of Fellini's other films (which although fascinating, can be almost alienatingly ostentatious .
179;"I love Fellini, anyway), every moment achieves both thematic relevance and beauty
180;A teeming world of moral incongruities are viewed through the jaded, romantic eyes of Rubini.
181;The close up of this ethereally beautiful and pure face addressing Rubini and the camera in words we can't hear, giving him a last chance of salvation, is spectacular.
182;LA DOLCE VITA is, perhaps, Federico Fellini at his finest hour.
183;This film is an honest, sobering and insightful look at the personal struggle of one man (Marcello Mastroianni) and the personal shadows he must continually box in order to carve out a shallow existence in the world.
184;On the surface, he is a high rolling and womanizing journalist living 'the charmed life.'
185;It's at once surreal and perhaps one of the most spontaneous scenes in the film.
186;This is truly one of the most beautiful and also the most disturbing films I have seen.
187;They are laid over the picture and absolutely ruin the image.
188;legendary film classic, we will all have to content ourselves with the VHS cassettes: two chunky tapes with semi.
189;born American movie star, plays .
190;Rarely has decadence looked so attractive, photographed in black.
191;So why is the story so engrossing?
192;Fellini, fascinated by the circus, knew how to hold an audience's attention"
193;All you have to do is sit back with a glass of Chianti and enjoy the show.
194;The film is undoubtedly enticing albeit sad at the same time.
195;"The viewer may be momentarily enticed by the pleasures that Marcello seeks, even including a strip tease by a woman who resembles Elizabeth Taylor
196;This film is great for someone who likes to try new things in films.
197;rated film from the lowest rating.
198;Lars Von Trier's """"Antichrist"""" was pure fun and action in comparison!!!"""
199;It is the same exact thing besides an extra disc and some collectable pictures and a poster.
200;I recently watched it again, and found the scene at Steiner's apartment to be quite fascinating.
201;LA DOLCE VITA is top notch Fellini.
202;la Dolce Vita and 8 and half are my top favorites.
203;loathing, Fellini also gives the viewer plenty of room to act as interpreter, and he cleverly plays one theme against its antithesis throughout the film.
204;and yet they still hold our interest over the course of this three hour film.
205;the cast is superior, with Marcello Mastroianni's personal charm particularly powerful.
206;As usual with Fellini, there is a lot to look at on the screen: although he hasn't dropped into the wild surrealism for which he was sometimes known, there are quite a few surrealistic flourishes and visual ironies aplenty.
207;But don't let that discourage you: even in this format its still a very worth while, very memorable film!
208;He aspired once to be an intellectual, and idealizes his friend Steiner, imagining that Steiner's life is the perfect blend of serious purpose and family warmth.
209;this guardedness affects his romantic relationships.
210;There's Emma, his steady girlfriend, who wants a commitment that he's unwilling to provide.
211;He dallies instead with movie stars, such as Sylvia (Anita Ekberg, whose zaftig charms show us how much standards of cinematic beauty have changed over forty years.)
212;His most moving encounter is with a young girl from the country, a waitress at a seaside resort.
213;The jaded Marcello is drawn to her innocence and optimism, because it takes him back to his younger self, a fresh arrival to the big city.
214;this is a rich movie, and its energetic inventions keep you hooked, even though it's almost three hours long.
215;As you would expect from one of the cinema's world masters, there's a lot of artful filmmaking here .
216;innovative night photography, a playful musical score by the brilliant Nino Rota, arresting visuals, such as the opening shot of a statue of Jesus being airlifted by helicopter over the city.
217;Many of Fellini's major preoccupations are on display as well.
218;His nostalgia for the simple, natural life of the country is played out in Marcello's interactions with the young waitress.
219;The carnival that is Italian Catholicism is brought hilariously to life when two young children claim to have visions of the Virgin Mary as a way of jerking the chains of their elders.
220;His warmth towards his characters, for instance.
221;Also, Fellini is the best there is at using cinematic imagery to create a dreamlike flow to his stories.
222;When he finally returned to those roots, he made Amarcord, an amazing fusion of realism and surrealism.
223;For me, it's Fellini's best movie, and perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made.
224;La Dolce Vita isn't as good as Amarcord, and much of its shock value has been diluted by time, but it's worth seeing for Mastroianni's seemingly effortless virtuosity and for the privilege of watching a great director capture the passing parade.
225;To watch it for the first time is to be surprised, to watch it more than once is to make discoveries.
226;But the scope is ever amazing.
227;It represents the line between his older and newer films, leaving sentimentality behind to an extent and embracing the world of fantasy and existentialism.
228;It was very beneficial in this way, yet in the process I was also introduced to a beautiful piece of cinema and storytelling that I would not have come across otherwise.
229;Like all the best of Fellini the twee hours really allow his themes and imagry to carry the story along in a surreal yet familiar setting.
230;Not to mention the glorious B&W cinematography and Anouk Aimee and Anita Ekberg.
231;until happy little Nico (of the Velvet Underground)sparked up onto the screen with the happiness and youth of a sparrow.
232;She is grand in her role.
233;She's in the prime of her beauty and she just fits in with the whole nonsense of the film.
234;Talented eye of his !
235;This surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms, the double moral, the frivolity, epidemical visions, unresolved gilts, an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of Rabelais or Moliere.
236;"Another sublime artistic feat of Federico Fellini
237;this movie is cool because Marcello hangs out, parties with the 'in crowd', and trashes somebody's apartment in Rome.
238;but seriously, this is another must see of Fellini's (8 1/2 of course) and definitely a msut if you love Rome.
239;if you're familiar with the cities monuments, smells or people you'll really enjoy this.
240;while not quite aspiring to the philisophical pretentions of 8 1/2, and not quite as visually appealing, this film rocks and you better see it!this reviewer also recommends 'Wild Strawberries', '8 1/2', 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull', 'Home Alone 6', etc.
241;I think La Dolce Vita is a perfect example for a style in the world cinema,named after his creator .
242;Inspired by Dante's works, this films stands up as the greatest Italian film ever made.
243;It was packaged nicely and appeared expensive as a Collector's Edition should be.
244;Arrived packaged nicely and on time.
245;Fellini won multiple Academy Awards for La Dolce Vita.
246;Many of his other films made previous to La Dolce Vita and after were also nominated and won Academy Awards.
247;But the films message is very meaningful today because our USA society has reached the same level of shallow decadence and narcissism that appeared in Rome in the late 1950's.
248;This masterpiece by Fellini should rank alongside Seven Samurai, Battleship Potemkin, and Rules of the Game as one of the best foreign language movies ever made.
249;He was pretty sympathetic I must say.
250;The pleasures of the upper.
251;After all, this is the """"good life"""" right?"""
252;Although Mastroianni gives an unforgettable performance, Fellini is the real star here.
253;ups and camera angles are all perfect.
254;This is a work of expert craftsmanship.
255;Not only is the movie amazing on a technical level, but it also shows true vision as well.
256;He shows that the rich are just like you and me with the only exception being the possession of money.
257;"As far as ""rambling"" movies go, this is probably the best one ever made."
258;It just paints a picture, but the picture has a purpose.
259;I recommend a drink or two while viewing.
260;Drink along with the characters.
261;The film is one of Fellini's greatest and most entertaining.
262;It concerns the life of a journalist as he examines the self indulgent upper class and how he eventually becomes part of it.
263;It looks absolutely stunning and virtually flawless.
264;If you have only seen the full screen version on TV or video, you will be delighted to see this film in it's original widescreen format, which is amazing to behold.
265;Also included is a wealth of special features that are bound to please fans of the film.
266;Highly recommended for fans of Fellini and/or of European cinema.
267;"this story is culturally valuable because it shows us the lifestyles of ""celebrities"" and aristocracy and how standards are formed around those lifestyles."
268;"The story reveals a side of ""the sweet life"" that is often untold and unnoticed."
269;It serves to remind us what is truly important, and to break up common illusions and misconceptions about the life of glamour.
270;This story exemplifies many facets of humanity that are universal and timeless.
271;the way the elements of style are used serves to increase the worth of the film and intensify the force with which its cultural value is presented.
272;"written and telling
273;Knowingly enough its Fellini's breakthrough film.
274;in this sporadic tale Marcello moves around the city with the paparazzi, ready to catch the action, and he has the power to make and break the Celebes he covers.
275;Marcello, a celeb himself, attends nightclubs and parties that go on until dawn that are given by intellectuals, hedonists, the decadent rich and various other parties.
276;One such memorable scene is over a false miracle (the media has a field day as a pair of children claim to have seen the Holy Virgin)"
277;The warmest scene had Marcello meeting with his father (Annibale Ninchi) and tempting him with the sweet life.
278;The film is much more than that, it's Fellini's statement about him as an artist and how he wants to make movies as both real life and fanciful art.
279;It's winsome because of the stylish cinematography, which fills the screen with mind.
280;"It's a special film, but has become dated
281;That was interesting for me, for personal reasons.
282;If that was the point, then the movie is quite successful.
283;This movie was right at the beginning of a new era in movie making.
284;Yvonne Furneaux is his neurotic, suicidal mistress and Anouk Aimee is a rich play.
285;In the most famous and entertaining sequence Anita Ekberg (in a marvelous performance) plays an actress with former Tarzan Lex Barker as her fiance.
286;Ekberg brings so much energy to her role that she keeps the first part of the movie afloat.
287;At the heart of the movie is Alain Cuny as Steiner.
288;Using Cuny was clever as he had become a symbol of European spirituality.
289;Daring for its time, Fellini's Oscar.
290;Yet its almost three hours' running time includes a procession of unforgettable images and scenes, as Mastroianni.
291;A sharply observed, absorbing study of dizzying decadence.
292;My favorite Fellini film, combining the brilliant kaleidescopic parading of faces that characterize his later films with the humanistic neorealism of his earlier work.
293;every single performance, even by the most trivial of parts, is astounding and some of the best ever captured on film.
294;My personal favorite is the clown trumpet player with the balloons at the Cha.
295;in the middle of his performance he flashes one quick look at Mastroianni that speaks volumes.
296;For instance, he comes across as a great Italian lover who has finally found the woman of his dreams, only to rediscover hours later that he cannot commit himself to any one person.
297;Throughout, Rubini constantly puts himself in start.
298;dimensional references, is an interesting portrayal of a man whose role in life seems to fall somewhere between participant and observer.
299;It is an interesting and highly daring focus on early 1960's Italian pop and underground cultures that might come across as shocking to some viewers over forty years later.
300;Of course this is not a review, you don't need to review perfect films, you just watch and enjoy.
301;I will be expecting the release date, so I can prepare the watching party, here in lovely Queretaro, Mexico.
302;No wonder this is such a classic movie.
303;Considered by many to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, """"La Dolce Vita"""" is a nearly 3."""
304;"hour long film that's low on plot
305;That's one of the great things about a Fellini film though, the spontaneity.
306;It's got Fellini's mood and atmosphere"
307;The title fits the film so well.
308;Throughout the film, we watch the hopeless protagonist Marcello search for the sweet life.
309;"La Strada has a childish innocence to it, ""La Dolce Vita"" has a young man transitioning into a world."
310;weary man in the form of a director.
311;"It's interesting to notice
312;This is a 5 star film all the way, a fact that owes thanks to the score by Nino Rota.
313;La Dolce Vita is a masterpiece.
314;It's long, but it's worth it.
315;then La Dolce Vita is the most spectacular example of this paradox that I've seen yet.
316;As a celebrity reporter, he walks the line between living a real life and creating one out of thin air, manipulating the people he knows and loves, hiding his emotions behind a veneer of indifference that threatens to suffocate him .
317;love and sex, life and death, friendship and family, religion and reality .
318;although 8 1/2 is regarded as Fellini's most personal film and enduring testament, I've always voted for La Dolce Vita as his masterpiece.
319;Understated (if a Fellini film can be), filled with majestic images that burn themselves into one's subconscious while inviting subsequent viewings, bursting with undiscussed passions and intentions, this is a document of a life ALMOST lived.
320;Marcello's job has driven him to a soul search as he finds himself short of qualitative accomplishments and good deeds, which leads him in some sort of despair.
321;The despair is augmented through Marcello's work that provides several opportunities to act upon his sinful desires.
322;Marcello is led into a continuous negative cycle, as he does something good that is shortly followed by a sinful act.
323;Despite his desire for other women Marcello longs for the strong connection of a family as he envies his friend Steiner (Alain Cuny) and his seemingly perfect family.
324;fellini directed a brilliant film with much to ponder and contemplate as most shots leave most of the story for the audience to reflect upon.
325;The result of the cinematic experience is an artistic experience that encourages thought and reflection upon life and self, which is nothing but brilliant.
326;Not only is Marcello a handsome devil, God rest his soul, the ladies, Anouk Aimee and Yvonne Furneaux, curves, beautiful faces,passionate acting, where the heck did that all go?
327;What do we have now, nothing, bring back the beautiful people in movies.
328;La Dolce Vita (The Daily Vitamin) has some truly unforgettable cinematography.
329;There was also another unforgettable scene, but I can't remember what it was.
330;fellini treats us to what seems like a couple dozen nights on the town with the overindulged rich and famous crowd.
331;Well, all the self serving religious folk gathered around hoping for a miracle while the kids had fun making sport of them.
332;I would recommend watching this film as a piece of cinematic history, and if you enjoy it, great, but if not, there should be no shame in that either.
333;I saw this film when I was five and it has haunted me my whole life.
334;I watch it every couple of years to see who I have become, and how my viewpoint of living has shifted.
335;Any sane soul living quasi.
336;Add to this Nino Rota's timeless score"
337;It's three hours of the most penetrating stuff I've ever seen, yet totally entertaining and charming, and ofttimes very, very funny.
338;There is something to be said for the pretty large number of film fans who love this one.
339;maybe the secret (if there is one) of LA DOLCE VITA's appeal is that it's so darned interesting all the time.
340;Steiner is the key figure in the film, apart from Marcello himself, who is Fellini's and the viewer's counterpart.
341;What Steiner represents to Marcello is of prime importance.
342;The young reporter sees the older man as a perfected, idealized version of himself.
343;He longs to emulate Steiner and is convinced this man knows how to live life fully.
344;This gives Marcello much to contemplate for the rest of the film.
345;For this reason the film is existential in its outlook.
346;Consider, for example, the significance of Marcello's interaction with the blonde girl in the cafe.
347;she represents a simpler life away from the city and the over.
348;lA DOLCE VITA is a great film for the way it pulls some viewers in and forces them to contemplate the actual content of what they are seeing.
349;The film's main theme is one it shares with fims of Antonioni: modern man has become disconnected from the natural world and he suffers because of it.
350;LA DOLCE VITA's visual style is poetic, some of its characters are more than compelling and hard to forget, and its musical score by Nino Rota is among the most memorable of all time.
351;This movie really describes what is the sweet life.
352;becomes clear and the film becomes increasingly engrossing.
353;The film begins to rise above being a sensational cultural artefact of the 1960s into a real portrait of a disintegrating Italian society that seems timeless and important.
354;looking in its opening scenes, but, starting with the late night odyssey through Rome with Anita Ekberg, it suddenly develops a real visual poetry and vocabulary all its own.
355;It's that rare film that seems to grow in importance and depth as it progresses towards an elliptical ending of surprising impact.
356;I recently reviewed a couple of Fellini's films and was so moved by them that decided to perform a huge retrospective of his production.
357;most of his films combine fantasy and reality in a rich mixture with no fixed boundaries.
358;"He displays his own personal approaches regarding religious belief
359;Every one has its own tempo and mood.
360;Some are tragic, some picturesque and some comic, but all of them are a precious film gem.
361;all main Fellini's themes are present and displayed poignantly.
362;social criticism: high class palaces contrasted with popular apartments"
363;finally: Mastroianni gives an outstanding performance at the peak of his career.
364;Anita Ekberg bathing at the Fountain is the everlasting trade mark of the film!This is one of the most wonderful films I ever seen!
365;I highly recommend it for adult audiences.
366;If you did so, though, you'd be robbing Fellini's best, most complex, and most deeply moving film of everything it deserves.
367;"A first viewing of Vita was enough to convince me that it's a brilliant film
368;Here is a movie that, for nearly three hours, holds you for dear life and then has you wanting it to go on at the credits.
369;Here is a movie that has moments of oddball recklessness and quiet beauty, both deliriously gorgeous"
370;top (look for Nico, of Warhol's 'Factory,' near the end), and the conclusion to which the film inexorably builds is as powerful as it is ambiguous.
371;Yes, 8 1/2 is an interesting film, but its pretention gets in the way.
372;Sure, La Strada and I Vitelloni are wonderful little neo.
373;realistic works, but they seem to just hint at something on the horizon for the director.
374;This is it, the Fellini movie that is perfect in every way.
375;With La Dolce Vita, Italy's most beloved director shows he belongs in the same breath as The Bicycle Thief and The Passion of Joan of Arc when we talk about the best foreign films ever made.
376;"The scene in the outdoor cafe is delicious and the scene in the fountain is now a standard (see ""Boxing Helena"")."
377;time with this movie and helped develop the future of film.
378;They spilt screen it so you can see the difference.
379;Once again a very satisfied customer.
380;"So I will approach my review from the historical significance of ""La Dolce Vita"">Some think that ""8 "" is Fellini's masterpiece
381;But for me """"La Dolce Vita"""" is the Maestro's masterpiece."""
382;Yet in this film you feel the effects of dreams and the drifting segmented form of dreams.
383;The film is set in the most exciting period of the history of cinema.
384;Incredibly well directed, put us into a wonderful world of dreamlike desires, anguishes and hopes.
385;Fellini's movies always talk the language of the unconscious mind.
386;"I was still on a massive high from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""Seven Samurai"", a rewatch of ""The Endless Summer"" and my all."
387;"time favorite (also Bruce Brown) ""On Any Sunday"" which I watch at least 3.4 times a year."
388;"Marcello lives amongst the ""look at me"" crew as a paparazzi and is silently swallowed by their world."
389;Fellini drove it home through hours of beautifully photographed scenes of easily.
390;that's about as subtle as Laugh.
391;It had to be me because this film has enormous cachet as a film.
392;"I used to be one of those guys, so I know I ""get"" that."
393;The greatest practitioners of it are those who immerse in and innovate on the nuance of the setup.
394;They see it as insiders do.
395;I enjoyed The Aristocrats myself, because for some reason I can't explain, I'm interested in how the structure/execution of the joke affects its effectiveness.
396;Fellini's masterpiece brilliantly showcases Roman decadence.
397;Top rate performances from Marcelo Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee.
398;Humorous, haunting and almost surreal only Fellini or Bunuel could create for the screen.
399;Catch that unforgettable song Arrivederci, Roma in the club scene.
400;Few films reach the realm of this Fellini masterpiece.
401;"I encourage anyone who considers himself a ""film buff"" or even just particular fond of the good stuff to see this film before long."
402;american actress coming to Italy to play, she has her most famous and memorable role.
403;the film is really centered on wonderful Marcello Mastroianni, who like other actors here, may be playing a version of himself.
404;He's a gossip columnist and full time party boy who is in action from dusk to dawn.
405;In fact most of the various scenes begin at night and end at the break of day.
406;He lives with one, but cheats on her constantly.
407;He loves her and others but can't be tied down.
408;His friend and mentor warns him as he led a similar life at one time.
409;the movie is sexy, fun, sad and dramatic at times.
410;Fellini manages to pull it off and adds some wonderful music to boot.
411;Most of the love for this film comes from the acting and the story, but the technical aspects are terrific as well.
412;Shot in stark black and white, it includes masterful artwork and cinematography.
413;Great cars from the era including a '58 TBird and a '59 Eldo, both convertibles, add industrial glamour.
414;marcello Mastroianni was masterful in the role of the reporter, in search of scandals who gradually becomes apart of the crowd he once wrote about.
415;As with all good movies, the minute you are cut off from the world it took you into, a sense of loss is felt.
416;It drips of flavor, rhythm, sex and life, while Fellini's camera never once wanders into the dangerous realm of objectivity.
417;century on this earth, life has been a wonderfully delicious mixture of sweet and sour, goodness and disgrace, dashed hopes and eternal optimism.
418;"And ""La Dolce Vita"" always ends up as my top pick among the world's great cinema because only Fellini can express this yin.yang of human existence."
419;fellini's masterpiece begins with Christ both literally and figuratively being brought down to the level of Man.
420;In between, Maestro Fellini shows us how one human being can inexorably fritter his life away, hoping against hope to overcome a distant relationship with his father, his reluctance to establish a true, loving bond with a woman, and find meaning in his chosen career.
421;"a dramatic contrast to the final scene at the shore in ""La Strada"" where Zampano's mind and heart come apart upon his understanding of how he has cast aside real love and genuine human connectedness."
422;fellini's genius is in rendering this rich morality play in a constantly engaging set of bittersweet vignettes, shot in exquisite black.
423;white and incredibly scored by Nino Rota, that touch all our senses without letup.
424;Nearly 50 years after its release, this often misunderstood masterpiece never ceases to mesmerize on big screen or small.
425;"Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" represents one of the high water marks of the Italian neo."
426;Fellini delivers a deliberate sheen to this otherwise tawdry little film, giving it a scope and grandeur that elevates the subject matter to high art.
427;The gray scale exhibits a depth of field and superb balancing with deep, solid black levels and brilliantly clean whites.
428;obtrusive to one's enjoyment of the film.
429;The anamorphic transfer simply sparkles with a minimum of age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for a remarkably smooth visual presentation.
430;It's being enjoyed very much.
431;The condition is evidently good and, it arrived on time.
432;I watched this movie once, a year prior to moving to Italy to study and work.
433;I found it very mesmorizing.
434;8 1/2 can do this to you too.
435;Even minor characters are very unique.
436;but still it's great to know that such an important film like La Dolce Vita is getting a 3.
437;this is one of the best and most important films ever made in film history by a director whose (I am sure) command of his art puts him easily at the same level as Hitchcock, Ford, Kurosawa and two or three others.
438;Rome is now a bright city full of stylish, vain, beautiful, rich people parading around exotic nightclubs, private parties and hot spots.
439;marcello (Mastroiani) is a journalist who earns his living writing about the beautiful people.
440;he is the perfect example of a character unable to make a stand and take control of his own life.
441;And just when Marcello starts to believe the change is possible.
442;He allows himself to become a portrait of all the things he wanted to run away from.
443;tHIS IS ONE OF the most fascinating portraits ever put on celluloid.
444;Everything is right in this masterpiece.
445;wardrobe (Oscar winner) and art direction by Piero Gherardi, cinematography by Otello Martelli, and music score by the legendary Nino Rota are more than perfect.
446;and remind us about the few films who are lucky enough to have so many gifted professionals in peak form.
447;the screenplay of La Dolce Vita is a masterclass in modern Cinema.
448;The whole film is composed of episodes in the life of Marcello.
449;add a sweet taste of a possible redemption (through love or honesty or truth).
450;an unsurpassed flawless gem that begs for a mature viewer.
451;Like any great work of art, La Dolce Vita demands time and a close look.
452;See it once, see it twice.
453;beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Fellini!We miss him so much!
454;La Dolce Vita is a travelogue of one man's singular and unique experience.
455;Fellini spares us the familiar arc and keeps the journey in a steady rhythm.
456;Every scene has been one way or another an influence in cinema ever since.
457;"A staple of ""Best of"" guides, beloved by critics, a huge success on its release and."
458;The era produced many innovative films that influenced cinema thereafter, and La Dolce Vita is primary in that regard.
459;criterion truly understands the film lover, the person who wants to know as much as possible about the film, including the how and why of its elements and the who and what behind its making.
460;the commentary by Richard Schickel, a true expert on film, is extremely literate and informative.
461;His command of his knowledge keeps the insights coming non.
462;His purpose is to inform and to interest, and he stays right on the mark throughout.
463;Interviews with Fellini himself as well as others involved in the production give excellent background and context to the film and to Fellini and his career.
464;film buffs will appreciate the care with which this extensive set of extras has been compiled.
465;Criterion certainly has set the standards for film editions, and this is one of their best.
466;When it came out it was considered very avant.
467;I've always admired his willingness to use people and places that are not obviously Hollywood perfect faces or perfect sets.
468;One wonders if this character is worth so much of our time.
469;the opening scene is brilliantly conceived.
470;The imagery of religion, tradition and history in conflict with the pleasures of the flesh, compromises of modern times and so forth, were probably very new and exciting concepts for the motion picture goer of 50 years ago.
471;Again very experimental and perhaps very exciting 50 years ago.
472;la Dolce Vita is one of the classics and will hold its place on that list with or without my support.
473;A student of film, a serious collector or simply a more thoughtful viewer is justified in considering this film.
474;"From its unforgettable opening image of Jesus flying over the rooftops of Rome to its conclusion at the desperate party that will never end, ""La Dolce Vita"" is a beautiful, disturbing and mesmerizing film which follows the movements of one tabloid writer (Marcello Mastroianni in the quintessential role of his career) as he first reports on and then becomes one of the dissipated pleasure."
475;"Fellini is at the height of his powers here, combining the earthiness of his earlier masterpiece, ""La Strada"" and the yet."
476;"come surrealism of ""Juliet of the Spirits"" to wonderful and totally satisfying effect."
477;I have watched it many, many times and always find something new.
478;in the visuals, the dialogue, the hypnotic rhythm set to Nino Rota's perfectly jaded musical backgrounds.
479;One striking image follows another.
480;the wild dance led by the satyr.
481;"the ""miracle children"" leading the crowd on a merry chase in the rain."
482;La Dolce Vita shows us the life of an Italian journalist who has a knack for being in the midst of celebrities and the social elites.
483;"This starts out interesting because he keeps his wits about him
484;The image of the """"beautiful people"""" in LDV gradually turns from fun and frolic into a life without purpose."""
485;as in most any Fellini movie, there are many terrific scenes, bizarre people, and brilliant imagery.
486;The acting is terrific as is the direction.
487;I've only seen LDV once and I am sure this is a movie that will deliver new insights each time I see it again.
488;Quite simply, this is the greatest film ever made.
489;Every performance is perfect all the way down to the extras.
490;The black and white cinematography is exquisite and the costume design is rivalled only by The Seven Samurai.
491;Federico Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA has been tooted as a monumental innovative film for its time.
492;First, this definitely rings out religious change, i. e., the Catholic church lost a leader, Pope Pius XII, but experienced an enormous restructuring with Vatican II.
493;"Fellini may have observed this change within the religious landscape and implements it with intermittent church scenes and miraculous visions that has gone with Catholicism as well as the ""flying"" Jesus statue that reappears through out the film."
494;lA DOLCE VITA a film about love and the absence of love.
495;Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni), main character, lives the good life, but as an observer, he sees the sweet as well as the bittersweet life that exist with his friends and acquaintances.
496;"Fellini states: ""There is an effort to show a world without love, characters full of selfishness, people exploiting one another."""
497;"He envies his friend, Steiner, who lives a ""structured"" life with his wife and two kids and the intellectual salon that he holds at his home."
498;overall, LA DOLCE VITA is a cinematic masterpiece.
499;The film itself will appeal to art and film students and anyone in between for further imitation and study.
500;It is one unique film simply was ahead of its time.
501;I know this is a classic award winning movie, but to be honest I just didn't get it.
502;The helicopter that carries it stops hovered over a hotel so the passenger can chat with some of the lovely ladies poolside.
503;not since Pulp Fiction have I been so captivated by the opening frames of a film.
504;This might sound cliched, but this movie is one of the most original films I've ever seen.
505;What sets it apart is the fact that when with a woman, he is truly, deeply in love.
506;His weakness is represented by the many terrific symbolic images in the film.
507;She comments on the beauty of the sounds it makes and calls Marcello to join her.
508;He comes to her, reaches out, and.
509;photographers clamber for the best angles and the most shots as the two come home to meet Sylvia's boyfriend.
510;Steiner lives a peaceful life, and Marcello envies that.
511;Peace is his greatest horror.
512;In the end he just walks away.
513;He's a giant of personality and a powerful figure.
514;I'm sure that everything I wrote and everything I noted but decided not to write only scratched the surface of this amazing film.
515;It's the type of film you have to watch more than once.
516;I'll be sure to watch it again.
517;This is perhaps the movie that put Federico on the worldwide map, many knew about him before but La Dolce Vita made him a master of the silver screen.
518;Nothing is worth anything, I guess once you achieve his level of popularity and wealth you can afford the luxury of making such statement.
519;Yet, most of his films reach the status of a genius film director.
520;One of the best films ever made, and essential for every collector.
521;interviews with Fellini, with Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni, are slight but entertaining.
522;mastered, with an extra feature showing side.
523;This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, a vast panorama of life in all its complexity: the search for love, for career, for perfection, and the deterioration of all flesh.
524;It is very much a film of the experience of a middle.
525;driven culture that resembles the US is many ways, yet has its own style.
526;Having lived in Italy, I particularly enjoyed Fellini's humor and savage wit, particularly about romantic illusions.
527;every ten years of so, I watch this film and marvel at its depth, at the new layers that I see.
528;The ending is truly shocking and unexpected, with incredible symbolism.
529;Along with Bergman, this is a true genius of the cinema.
530;"The is a movie of stunning images that taken together provide a stunning and ironical montage of ""the good life."""
531;Many of the scenes are stunning.
532;the beginning is memorable, with a helicopter flying over Rome with a statue of Christ hanging underneath.
533;The overwhelming sense in the film is of the tremendous triviality of these people's lives and the loss of moral purpose.
534;There are only two exceptions in the film: Marcello's close friend Steiner, whose life is a search for meaning and truth, and a young girl Marcello first meets at a restaurant where she is a food server and then sees again in the last few moments of the film.
535;But her words are drowned by the waves and the wind, and eventually they both smile, realizing that they he will never be able to hear what she has to say.
536;It is one of the most heartbreaking moments in modern film, as well as one of the most poignant.
537;special mention has to be made of the extraordinary music for the film written by the incomparable Nino Rota, and easily stands as one of the very greatest film scores ever written, as integral to the success of the film as Bernard Hermann's scores for NORTH BY NORTHWEST or PSYCHO or Ennio Morricone's for A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.
538;a spectacular film, one of my favorites ever.
539;It is arguably Fellini's greatest film, and one of the great monuments of cinema.
540;value of his own fantastic and idiosyncratic vision of the world.
541;"Filled, like all Fellini films, with stunning, bizarre images and faces and marked by the director's wild comic imagination, the film was widely condemned as vulgar, witless, and intellectually bankrupt"" and lavishly praised as ""a cultural and social document, as well as an exciting entertainment."""
542;La Dolce Vita moves from one shocking sequence to another.
543;It is a sprawling epic satire on what Fellini considered the spiritual malaise of modern society.
544;The film is fascinating, and the remastering and restoration excellent.
545;The film deserves a much more distinguished critique than this.
546;era concrete slums that feature in pictures of Russian cities.
547;There's little sweet in the life of the main character Marcello Rubini or the beautiful people he hangs out with.
548;There is a moment in the film, quite touching in a way, when the father decides suddenly to return home.
549;The picture stays with you and leaves you feeling a little hollow.
550;It's well worth watching but I wouldn't think it a be.
551;Although many argue about the meaning of his films, few will debate Fellini's impact on cinema and popular culture.
552;I find it amusing how many people try to find a moral message in his films and characters.
553;That's a lot like real life.
554;Feminists always hate Fellini's portrayal of women as sex objects.
555;"The same director who gave us La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 turned around and made a brilliant film about a middle aged woman's point of view in ""Juliette of the Spirits""."
556;This film is oddly prescient in predicting that mania for the rich and famous.
557;"This cinematic leech is precisely where the term ""Paparazzi"" comes from."
558;in spite of all this, Fellini's films are fun.
559;He seems to have the unique ability to breezily make biting social commentary, while at the same time showing us all the decadent fun we want.
560;Like this film, the best thing is to just jump in and experience it.
561;Everybody wants to live the sweet life, but what is the sweet life?
562;"A wise priestess tells him, ""When something good happens, good."
563;"The priestess said, ""Give thanks for everything."""
564;I mean, this is what Fellini is expressing in showing us the world he creates.
565;realist Fellini filmmaking is this embrace.
566;a film like this one deserves more .
567;A 2 Disc Collector's Edition suggests a full and well rounded collection of supplemental features, but I doubt anyone other than completest Fellini fanatics will find much value in the supplemental features here.
568;Fellini captures the excitement of Rome so well.
569;It is also a very interesting look at relationships that corresponds to the director's own personal experiences (read his book 'I Fellini').
570;i found this to be a lot more entertaining than 8 1/2 despite the length .
571;Fellini's gorgeous masterpiece is still as relevant today as it ever was.
572;"Indeed, one should live ""outside of passions, beyond emotion."""
573;LA DOLCE VITA is a visual spectacle that is as dazzling as it is exhausting.
574;Somewhere in the middle of the film, during a quiet moment of daylight reflection Marcello gets a glimpse of truth in the innocent eyes and warm smile of a beautiful but unglamorous young waitress, and he is enchanted.
575;In a moment there is recognition and understanding but this moment will pass.
576;Antonioni's film is a bit more cerebral whereas Fellini's is whimsical.
577;In all seriousness, La Dolce Vita is well made, well acted, and contains some glorious filmaking such as the scene when soft Italian newspaper reporter and platinum blond actress first dance and then she is swept off her feet by a fellow mutant actor that looks like a cartoonish devil.
578;intellectual comic figure, Arne And, I felt an urgent need to become acquainted with his works.
579;She was through with Fellini, but I decided to give it another shot.
580;Simply one of most amazing films ever made.
581;I think Amarcord is wonderful, 8 1/2 is pleasantly bizarre and the Satyricon is good for a laugh.
582;The film is, simply put, as intelligent and complex as anything out there.
583;"Look at the final party, in which a tired actress allows herself to be feathered before saying, with true fatigue, ""that was fun, but the party is over."
584;Marcello Mastroianni gives a truly nuanced performance, and his discontentment is evident in his every word.
