1;good movie to enjoy with the boys!
2;One of my favourite movies growing up.
3;Very cool behind the scenes, interviews, etc.
4;Those 2 movies are my favorites of all time.
5;Dont call yourself a man if you dont own this movie, because all real men such as myself own and love this movie.
6;Arnold Schwarzenegger continues defining his well known style and reputation from 'Conan' with this 1987 hit that was ahead of its time.
7;Schwazenegger is Dutch, a guerilla war fighter with a team of good.
8;Sonny Landham is perfect as the 6' muscle.
9;The Predator is an effect you have to see for yourself.
10;rasing explosions around the story to make it a perfect 'Arnold' trademark movie.
11;packed we'll be alright for now.
12;The predator in the movie is amazing.
13;John McTiernan does a brilliant job of building suspense throughout the movie which makes you love this movie.
14;predator contains a great plot with great characters and is a legendary action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger acting in his peak.
15;The special effects are also outstanding and they will never be out of date.
16;This movie is a classic tense thriller and it deserves the credit which it receives.
17;One of my best films so watch it and find out what you think.
18;Also probably the greatest Mans movie ever created.
19;With the music and soundtrack added alot of excitement and fear to the film.
20;I think Dumb and Dumber had more added features than Predator!
21;But an upgrade it is.
22;I always liked Predator and I'm likely to watch it again.
23;Predator is one of my favorite science fiction films, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film with digital remastering.
24;Twenty years on, and several sequels later, Predator without a doubt, is not only the best in the series, but still a great, inventive and incredibly suspenseful movie.
25;much of the commando team proves memorable, notably Jesse Ventura as Blaine and fantastic Carl Weathers as Dillon.
26;Here he seems completely at ease in his character with good dashes of humor, What's the matter Dillon?
27;This is probably my favorite role for Arnie.
28;the story here is simple but effective, the filmmakers settling on a less is more strategy in almost every category.
29;A special forces team on a central American jungle mission are tracked and killed by an alien hunter.
30;surprisingly the elementary special effects still do the job .
31;Authenticity is also a question with so many recent movies going mega realistic on military tactics.
32;the music score is fantastic, and memorable.
33;The predator is judiciously revealed, a tactic that definitely adds to the suspense factor of the movie.
34;McTiernan's pre Die Hard direction is awfully good.
35;He keeps everything at a simmer and when its time, the movie goes to full boil.
36;the script's subtlety comes to the fore with a great final showdown with the wonderfully menacing Predator.
37;Dutch uses the cunning of a hunter, and largely, his own two hands and not guns to win the battle.
38;This is a rare thing in modern action movies where we are commonly assaulted with endless pornography of automatic weapons.
39;nails action epic, this little flick from 1987 added to Schwarzenegger's repertoire as the go.
40;Predator is essentially the perfect action flick.
41;While latter day efforts like Rollerball may indicate otherwise, McTiernan is (or was) a genuine master of his craft.
42;The film is perfectly paced, the effects are solid (if admittedly bit dated by now) and not overpowering and the characters are brought to life by larger than life personalities.
43;You'll be laughing one minute and be perched on the edge of your seat the next.
44;while not quite in the same league as, say, Ridley Scott's Alien, Predator delivers the goods in spades.
45;It has a fresh and original concept, a great cast and enough thrills to make it worth watching again and again.
46;This is an awesome movie I liked this movie so much it's just such a good movie and I especially liked the part where the one guy looks strait at the Predator sees the wigly sight of a cloak then before he knew what hit him ppssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh his whole facial area is gone Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha mess with a Predator you get a hole blown strait through the middle of your head.
47;well that's all I have to say about this movie
48;If you are an Arnold fan this is the movie for you!!!!
49;Good Game DRM, protecting consumers from a great movie.
50;I loved this movie as a kid and now its on Blu.
51;let start out by saying that this movie looks and sounds amazing in Hi.
52;This movie is absolutely superb!
53;I liked Alien, but this one is even better!
54;The fight scenes were awesome, and Arnold did a great job.
55;I thought his weapons were outstanding and that his final fight with Arnold was the best part of the movie.
56;ray format of these movies).
57;For us who watched this movie when it was released, it was amazing the hunter alien fighting Schwarzenegger and all his team.
58;Having been a fan of this movie.
59;I liked the remastered version.
60;Schwarzenegger shines in this action flick.
61;Good performances by the rest of the cast, too.
62;The action is thick and fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful.
63;This is a macho romp sure, but a good one .
64;regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on.
65;Best of all is that this was a scary movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot.
66;But AVOID the new ultimate Hunter Edition on Blu.
67;ray looks natural and detailed with film grain and all.
68;so it's timely to see one of his all.
69;some consider Predator to be the best action film ever made.
70;While I wouldn't go quite that far, it's certainly up there in the top 10 .
71;and it's also one of my favourite films of all time.
72;It easily ticks all the right boxes a simple plot, big beefy men with big beefy guns, some cracking one.
73;Even after multiple viewings, Predator still manages to be tense, exciting and surprising.
74;It's easily one of big Arnie's best films it certainly helped to cement his place on the Hollywood map and Weathers (best known as Apollo Creed in three Rocky films) has not done anything half as good since.
75;it's big
76;And to top it all off, it's got one of the best movie villains ever created the Predator himself, a marvellous piece of design from special effects supremo Stan Winston.
77;as the movie moves along, McTiernan shows great control of the camera by maintaining focus on his main attraction, namely Schwarzenegger.
78;There are a lot of dodgy 3.
79;d effect really does enhance the film taking you deep into the jungle with Arnie and his men.
80;For me, anyway, the most remarkable thing about this mix is Alan Silvestri's almost nonstop underscore, one which utilizes a lot of cool percussive effects.
81;Alan Silvestri's score easily fills the surrounds and really helps to augment the listening experience.
82;It's an unusually effective score for a film that is often dominated by sound effects and it deserves more attention than it routinely gets, even by fans of the film.
83;special Features and Extras:All supplemental material can be found only on the standard definition 2.
84;of doc is actually a retrospect that features footage from the set and allows a good majority of the folks who worked on the movie to speak.
85;Most interesting is a talk about the jungle terrain, the choice of weapon for Ventura's character, and a look at the stunts.
86;Topping them off is a heart.
87;Although rightly deleted, they are still worth a quick look.
88;finally, in the end, Predator is one sci.
89;fi/action extravaganza with a shrewdly understated sense of irony, using genre conventions effectively for a fun time at the movies.
90;feature was a novel twist to the summer blockbuster, igniting a popular franchise.
91;Today, it remains just as entertaining as ever with one of Stan Winston's most memorable creations.
92;john McTiernan's Predator is a fun and entertaining creature.
93;feature which revels in its animated machismo and an exuberant display of graphic action.
94;The movie is a surprisingly well.
95;structured blend of genre conventions which draws viewers in with one set of expectations and abruptly changes pace for a suspenseful thrill ride.
96;ray surprises with a strong 3.
97;All in all I can heartily recommend picking up Predator 3.
98;A totally brilliant film, with an excellent transfer and wonderful 3.
99;Predator is one of the best sci.
100;It's definitely in my top ten sci.
101;fi films, Predator is just right.
102;I saw this movie on the big screen and have loved it ever since.
103;Arnie and his crack team sent on a rescue mission.
104;And the first half of the movie is just a great action movie.
105;I just love this movie!
106;And this set has a lot of great features, interviews and making of stuff to really give a complete overview of a classic film.
107;There a lot wide shots of the jungle , the scene where Billyis sensing something in the trees and Dutch approaches him , we see two little figures 
108;It was a good gift to give around the holidays.
109;Classic Schwarzenegger ovie, a lot of fun and cool sentences, a must.
110;Arnold does some great kick.
111;Great movie with a great supporting cast.
112;I consider Predator, and its sequel, to be a fascinating new way to look at Aliens.
113;It is refreshing to see a species portrayed as technologically advanced but with a tribal, violent culture.
114;For once we are able to have a real understanding of the Aliens' motivation.
115;The trouble is that the Predators appreciate intelligent and powerful prey and have therefore selected humans for the hunt.
116;in the first film we just see the hunting habits of a predator in the jungle.
117;the predator movies have spawned a wonderful series of comics which have since merged with the Alien comics to produce a top selling line called Predator vs Aliens .
118;Like a used one at least I'd feel better about it being operational.
119;Though not the greatest sci fi action flick ever made (Aliens will always hold that title), it si still one of thebest pure action adventure movies ever made.
120;A creature that blends into the forest, unseen.
121;And when Anna is rescued, Dutch is determined to face the beast alone, and hope that he'll make it out alive.
122;this special edition is loaded with bonus features, but it's the film that you will want to watch again and again.
123;see for any fan of action films.
124;An Amerrican Classic, one of my all time favorite movies.
125;Action packed pulse pounding thrill ride.
126;Love this film and it will always be great in my eyes!
127;It demands my highest praise.
128;taking intellect all give it a lethal edge.
129;i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a head.
130;driven and are more character.
131;defining than the Terminator and Alien series.
132;Predator boasts surprisingly subtle special effects despite its age.
133;Tensions between Schwarzenegger and Weathers run believably high, and the gravity of their predicament comes across in deadly earnest.
134;The DTS is great for a movie like that.
135;I consider it to be one of the best action movies of all time.
136;ray figuring it'd be a good start to my favorite movies collection.
137;Gone is the gritty, dark feel of the original.
138;ray to anybody with eyes.
139;At times it was excellent, in fact most of the movie had really good sound, something that the Laser Disk was missing.
140;I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
141;I just hope and pray Fox does a better job with their masters in the future.
142;Really enjoyed watching this in high definition.
143;If you want a movie with stuff blowing up and big guns, look no further than Predator.
144;Even today, the film holds up pretty well, and as long as you're not some kind of movie snob, you should enjoy it.
145;fi/action fun at its best, and introduced the world to what's still considered one of the coolest movie monsters ever.
146;I will give this track some credit though.
147;set interviews with the cast and crew where they share some fun stories and talk about working on the movie.
148;If you want to see just how overdone the smoothing is, you can easily do an image search for this blu.
149;ray: Predator Ultimate Hunter Edition and see for yourself.
150;ray enthusiasts who go around on blu.
151;Tight action, great adventure, right on acting.
152;Which I prefer, brings back childhood memories with my dad.
153;This is easily one of Arnold's best, if not his best.
154;I've loved this movie since I saw it a very long time ago.
155;I've owned it for a while too, but my goodness.
156;Yes, it's unrealistic (Gatling guns weigh way too much to be handheld), but quite fun to watch him tear apart his weak opponents.
157;I always love this part.
158;it's a good way to set up a movie
159;a very well developed villan.
160;Great game, and you can play as a Predator, Alien, or heavily armed Marine.
161;Predator is a horror/action movie that was most likely inspired by Alien.
162;this one has all of the elements of an Arnold adventure (the big guns, unforgettable quotes, etc.) but tends to lack the good story and spellbinding suspense and action.
163;At first there was a good Commando.
164;Yeah, that's what makes it realistic but they overdid the realism.
165;Regarding the film itself, it is one of the quintessential '80s action flicks.
166;Its machismo is summed up perfectly by this line from Jesse Ventura's character: I ain't got time to bleed.
167;If you're an action fan, this film is absolutely worth owning.
168;def master and digitally scrubbed it.
169;a shot here, a shot several minutes later
170;Let's be honest: both transfers have major issues for largely opposite reasons.
171;The Ultimate Hunter Edition went overboard with the DNR but has improved color and black levels as well as retaining nearly all the bonus content of the 2.
172;Predator is a hell of a ride, and this is about muscles, guns, blowing up things, intelligent scripting, principles, values, honor, teamwork, an awesome villain, and big muscles.
173;There are huge amounts of muscles throughout the film, starting with Arnold, and then onto Carl Weathers, Jesse The Body Ventura, and Sonny Landham.
174;Ironically, the last two stars and Arnold himself made runs for state governorships, and two of them have won.
175;Because it is a work of a director with an artistry vision.
176;John McTiernan succeeds in Predator and then takes what he can and applies it to Die Hard.
177;Ever since I saw this movie first, I've always considered Predator one of the best action.
178;adventure pictures made, and this still stands strong today.
179;One example, a great one, is the difference in facial expressions between Predator and innumerable of so. called action.
180;I've always found it stupidly unrealistic while I appreciate the honesty and human nature of the looks on the characters.
181;It is really of a very monumental importance because they aren't machines but humans just like us.
182;So, those men, while packing an awesome amount of firepower and muscles, try to do their jobs as given, and the leader made a conscious task to find the suspicious creature before it gets unleashed into the world of civilizations.
183;While the movie actually starts at the 45th minute, the action is just perfect in Predator, and it's undoubtedly one of the most suspenseful thrillers made.
184;While at that, I loved how the characters were able to convey on what they've learned about their adversary.
185;As I said, the script is excellent, and a few of the lines are very memorable.
186;I've said that The Seven Samurai was way too long and that The Magnificent Seven was a magnificent bore, but Predator is the best of all.
187;That's why it's a real winner.
188;That was, on a scale of one to ten, an eleven.10/10: Predator is the one of the best sci.
189;The And Then There Were None is sublime, and Predator makes for a far more entertaining flick than The Seven Samurai.
190;I also think it is an underrated flick and is gaining steam as of lately as a respected classic.
191;There is a lot of memorable moments and also liners in Predator that are well.
192;known among fans of the film.
193;That makes Predator a more exciting movie to watch again and again.
194;What I love about it is the subtle diversion of the plot.
195;The conclusion becomes inevitable, but intelligence saved the day for the humans.
196;All in all, Predator is an outstanding picture and is already a classic.
197;I also catch it on cable here and there.
198;It was so crisp and clear it was like looking through a window.
199;You can see every whisker and drop of of sweat on all their faces.
200;The forest, the predator, the girl just so freaking amazing!!!
201;I loved this film before but now blu.
202;ray it moves up a while new level!
203;Wow!As far as the story this film is really two films.
204;It's funny I think the first part was one of the best mercenary/military types of films of the 80's.
205;I love Arnold no doubts, but I think as an ensemble this group worked so well together.
206;I find now days that I will often watch the film right up to the point when the predator starts killing and then I stop watching.
207;anyway, this is a great film and still in my mind a bit underrated by the public at large.
208;in the end, its a fun movie filled with lots of action.
209;If you like Arnold and Alien themes, this is a great movie to watch.
210;to where I'd almost call it a classic for a handful of very artistic shots (if that can be said of an Arnold Movie).
211;Watch it and you'll see.
212;This is a good movie.
213;I never got that wow factor.
214;The scene was clear looking and vibrant.
215;The writing was solid, the action was great, the cast worked well together, and the story marked the beginning of an overall decent series, which was later combined with the Alien storyline to make another series of movies, comics, and games.
216;Having said that, I would not only recommend this movie to people who grew up in the 80s, but also to anybody who enjoys an entertaining sci.
217;A great addition to my movie collection.
218;Always been a fan of the first predator film.
219;com but was pleasantly surprised.
220;Much of the movie is shot in the deep dark jungles.
221;sound track is detailed and fun.
222;but if you are simply looking to enjoy this great classic sci.
223;Suddenly, the team, composed of action movie stalwarts like Carl Weathers and Jessie The Body Ventura (later to become the popular and unpredictable Governor of Minnesota) and a terrific supporting cast, discovers a wrecked attack helicopter and a platoon of US Army Rangers skinned alive and hung up in the trees.
224;from this moment on everyone knows something bizarre is going down.
225;Schwarzenegger does a wonderful job here, and his performance shows why he was so appealing in his prime.
226;He is tough, cautious, and very thorough, and yet portrays the character as very human, vulnerable, and at times confused by the events so rapidly transpiring around him and this is not so easy to do for a six foot two, 230 pounds behemoth with a tough as nails image.Yet this image is played with artfully here with clever one.
227;liners and great gallows humor throughout the film, without ever becoming campy or predictable.
228;Early on he recognizes something supernatural is afoot, and shows his willingness to suspend his ordinary judgements in favor of conceding to new possibilities, and it is this willingness to be open and eclectic that makes him such a formidable foe to the alien stalking them.
229;The special effects for the alien are key here, and a lot of rework was done to make him as frightening and believable a character as possible.
230;a. mano showdown between the alien and Schwarzenegger is an unbelievably well choreographed set of action sequences, and takes place over several encounters with a wild and unexpected plot twist or two.
231;This is one everyone will love to have on their A. list' for action flicks to take down on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
232;Here is a movie sure to keep you laughing and still on the edge of your seat for hours.
233;This one comes with both thumbs WAY UP!
234;It's one of the finest action movies of the 80s, and one of Arnold's crowning achievements.
235;This movie is so great, aspeccially if you don`t know anything about it at all, as did, first time I saw it.
236;Great alien, alot of muscles and weapons.
237;BUT, when Carl Weathers looses his shooting right arm in a battle with predator you can clearly see his real arm on his back.
238;I did`nt see it until the 4th.
239;time i saw the movie, but one of my favorite films of all time got a bad scratch in the paint there.
240;Othervise it`s a great action movie with all the ingrediences.
241;The fine detail is better in the 08' edition.
242;This ULTIMATE DNR EDITION belongs next to Schwarzenegger's wax figure.
243;Predator is one of my favorite movies of all time and it is a shame how Fox has abused this movie.
244;Fox keeps spitting in the faces of Predator fans.
245;In this gory classic, a group of modern.
246;It can see the heat from the human body.
247;This movie is so good, just shows you brain and brawn can go together.
248;All the actors are so good in their roles
249;I know it's fantasy, I mean, it's totally unbelieveable, but it's fun to watch!
250;This is easily one of the best action movies ever made, the ultimate tough guy movie!
251;the best of the best are sent out into the amazon jungle to recover some hostages, a simple in and out job right?
252;there is something in the jungle that gives these tough guys a run for their money.
253;It's a battle between the best earth has to offer versus the best the universe has to offer in an all out battle to the death that will go down in movie history not only as arnold's best movie but as the best sci.
254;Fantastic movie, The plot is simple and so good that anyone could of played the lead role.
255;The alien is fantastic and Arnie and co make it work so well.
256;ups makes the price well worth it.
257;this is truly what arnold is all about, a hardcore .
258;for when it was made, '87 i believe, the predator itself is extremly well done, it looks very real, they also did a great job on predators technology.
259;the fight scene w/ the gorillas is one of the best scenes in an action movie ever.
260;this is a must see movie
261;I enjoyed almost every minute of it, and of course enjoyed Arnie and his smashing one.
262;The finale is as exciting as it is brutal, we get to see the ugly alien up close and personal, and there is a thrilling final showdown between Arnie and the Predator.
263;This movie was fun for me, although it takes a little while to get to the alien stuff, its still fun and gruesome.
264;Its a good thing that this movie is alot better than any remake.
265;Lots of explosions and machinegun blasts later, the mission is accomplished, sort of.
266;No one stands a chance against it's stealth and superior technology.
267;Arnold is in peak condition, and Stan Winston's monster is totally convincing.
268;Watch and see what the governor of california used to do for a living!
269;Predator is a 1987 american science fiction action film that tells the story of an special forces team, led by 'Dutch' (Arnold Schwarzenegger), on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory in Central America.
270;As time wore on, though, people warmed up to the film and is actually considered one of Schwarzenegger's best films in his career.
271;It's just a picture with depth to it.
272;I kept finding myself saying Wow this is cool!
273;ups of the actors, the clarity of the beads of sweat on their faces.
274;Good final showdown between Dutch (Arnold) and the Predator.
275;but this is probably the best.
276;And it's a great movie!
277;I love Arnold and the old school action movies, and this is one of the best.
278;One of the best 80's action movies of all time.
279;It still holds up pretty well despite its age.
280;Pretty solid performances throughout, quotable lines, over the top action, and a pretty good story line.
281;appreciated outside of comic book circles, it nevertheless influences art and entertains audiences.
282;the last time I can remember seeing this flick, I was either passing through ship's berthing, or somebody's apartment in San Diego.
283;And we glimpse the cast and crew at work.
284;We also hear tantalizing slips about the differences between the original script and the theatrical cut, about the development of the special effects, and about the filmmaker's creative vision.
285;Still, Mr. McTiernan seems to elaborate most about the filmmaking experience.
286;He had to go under the table and get a private video editing company to make up the effects at the last minute.
287;type of the big special effect film.
288;The thermal vision looks great, the cloaking device top.
289;introduced me to Ol' Painless: a fantastic and highly influential weapon of fiction.
290;held weapon was utterly believable.
291;it also gives action/suspense movies their due.
292;It's the tale of America's top hostage rescue team rendered impotent by a ghostly monster.
293;The Predator itself surely counts as one of the more unique and powerful critters in Hollywood's halls.
294;It also introduced America to a director who just about defined late `80's and early `90's big top action films.
295;mcTiernan action films seem to work because he understands an audience's visceral needs.
296;He injects a modicum of humanity into frames full of shootouts and explosions.
297;It boasts iconic weapons and a truly formidable enemy presented by well.
298;As far as big eighties action/horror/suspense/special effect films go, *Predator* is a film to catch and appreciate.
299;And the Guy Movie among Guy Movies as well
300;And don't deny the great performance of what's.
301;His freakouts are genuinely believable.
302;and seriously, every single line Arnold utters is immense entertainment.
303;When I was younger a friend told me about a monster that came from outer space and hunted humans, taking their skulls as trophies and moving with the greatest agility and speed.
304;and am still mightily impressed today.
305;His team are inserted deep behind enemy lines to accomplish their mission.
306;The storyline is enthralling and certainly creates interest.
307;There's no fooling around and John McTiernan presents a believable and direct story that ensures plenty of action and drama.
308;This makes the audience believe that this team really is experienced and that they are familiar with each other.
309;It also presents their individual traits and personalities with great effect.
310;This also adds to the realism, drama and impact of the film as a whole and so Predator gets another 10/10 for its clever structure and sub.
311;now the Predator himself is amazing: he's tall, silent, tough as s*** and armed to the teeth with some incredible otherworldly technology.
312;He's more than a worthy opponent for Dutch and his crew, and every aspect of the Predator is interesting, terrifying and awe.
313;We also see through the eyes of the Predator, we become him during certain periods.
314;The attention to detail on the Predator character is simply phenomenal, and we actually learn alot about this violent yet intelligent invader through this film.
315;McTiernan has developed and presented believable and interesting, multi.
316;dimensional, complex characters
317;It's just total genius, what can I say?The fight scenes are fueled with action and energy, and the showdown between Dutch and the Predator is epic to say the very least.
318;The film is not overly complex in its approach, but this is perfect since Predator is a no.
319;point and brilliant film that totally rips other Sci.
320;It's just great and a movie you will watch over and over again.
321;packed, enthralling, exciting and wonderful Sci.
322;This movie has it all and even the special.
323;Predator was a truly magnificent movie.
324;action lovers must see this movie.
325;i think the Predator should have won, judging by the facts.
326;this movie has stunning special effects, a good cast of characters,rather interesting storyline.
327;Aside from this being a great flick it looks really good on blu ray.
328;I would recommend this for anyone, definitely worth the price.
329;I love the movie and this was really cool to watch.
330;If you love the movie the way I do you will really love the Ultimate Hunter Edition.
331;The Special effects used for the creature are amazing !!!
332;A must see and each time it's viewed you will discover more exciting details !!!
333;This is probably one of Arnold's best performances.
334;There is plenty of action and fun dialogue in this movie.
335;This unseen creature is scary and we can see the results of this monster.
336;Actor/director Bill Duke has some great moments in this film.
337;Arnold is back in one of the biggest and baddest Action/Sci.
338;wall action of RAMBO with the otherworldly terror of Ridley Scott's ALIEN, PREDATOR has become a universal classic that brings together fans of Science Fiction, Action, and Horror.
339;The key casting creates a powerhouse of memorable characters, led, of course, by fan favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger, but backed by equally enjoyable performances from mean man Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Carl Weathers.
340;bending armor, the Predator is the perfect hunter.
341;It is smart, resourceful, and equally deadly.
342;With reptilian skin, sharp mandibles, and a defining set of dreadlocks that reach down from beneath its battle helmet, the Predator is one of the most unique and interesting creature designs ever caught on film, adding to Stan Winston's impressive collection.
343;Alan Silvestri's primal score also adds excitement and intrigue to the fast.
344;offs in all forms of media spanning over the course of the last two decades, which proves the lasting impact of John McTiernan's classic film in pop culture.
345;I was so excited when i heard that they were re.
346;oh well, it is still worth it for the main feature.
347;This is probably my favorite Sci.
348;This is a very fun movie, with good action and fun action actors.
349;It will be viewed many times.
350;Predator, this has to be the most compelling science fiction movie I'v ever seen with the exeption of Aliens.
351;The look of the creature it self is completly original.
352;The sound Track is the best I've ever heard.
353;Every thing is perfect with this movie.
354;don't believe all the whiners, Predator: The Ultimate Hunter Edition is the best this film has ever looked, and probably ever will look.
355;The rest of it looks great.
356;This movie is one of the most engaging and intense science fiction movies ever made.
357;An alien lands in the jungles of Central America and is on a hunt with humans serving as the prey.
358;Most of the team is killed and it comes down to a one.
359;The climactic battle pits the alien and the high technology against Schwarzenegger and his guile and ability to fashion simple and effective weapons out of jungle materials.
360;this movie also has some of the best dialog of all science fiction movies and Jessie Ventura was particularly impressive as a member of the mercenary team.
361;My favorite science fiction movie of all time is Aliens and this one is not far behind.
362;Item is in a format my blu.
363;The special effects are fairly good and hold up well enough.
364;ray, Video On Demand, etc) you bought.
365;the big difference with this edition comparedto the us version is not just the time ratio it is in fact the Predator alien played with mastery by the late kevin peter hall a brother from another mother(R. i. p) (with the power of invisibility and deadly skin melting plasma shots can actually be clearly heard and understood when it speaks, which i found to be incredibly fascinating.
366;the one thing i did find surprising in this extras disc is even the most muscular of men can prove to be the kindest of gentlemen with wonderful senses of humor.
367;This is one of Arnold's best action films.
368;This is a classic action movie that you must see.
369;packed suspense thriller that will keep you guessing and keep you on your toes.
370;also see the sequel: Predator 2
371;All the one star reviews are referring to the already released predator Blu.
372;I saw this in the theater years and years ago and hadnt seen a trailer at all so the entire movie was a surprise and I really enjoyed it.
373;This edition is nice, video and audio have been translated well at it appears to be in the letterbox format I was going for when I bought this one.
374;I say appears because I dont have anything to compare it against to let me know for sure one way or the other, but I am happy with it.
375;Makes a nice addition to the collection, though I would have rather there been a two box set or something with the second movie, it too is a good movie on its own.
376;The witty and sometimes humorous dialogue is an added bonus to this suspenseful action film.
377;Another bonus to this film is that we can see Minnesota's favored son .
378;But it is Arnold who shines throughout this film as he hunts (or is he hunted?)
379;Predator is a great movie that I have watched at least 30 times.
380;This movie in my opinion is one of the best action movies ever made.
381;The movie was painstakingly made and the scenes look amazing.
382;this movie is great fun and I think you will love it, if you don't already.
383;thank you for reading my review.
384;This is shooter, a stalker and a top piece of all out action cinema.
385;It's very entertaining, tense and full of destruction.
386;next to aliens this movie was amazing.
387;great plot,characters,setting,visual effects,acting,directing and so forth.
388;is probably the best action film ever made.
389;As this film is pretty much perfect in every way, even with the effects involved made in 86.
390;The director and cast are brilliant, and nobody can redo whatever this bunch of lunatics cooked up in that sweaty jungle out there.
391;the conversion is done cheaply but with an eye to making it as good as the budget allowed it to be.
392;meaning there is very good depth in most of the film there were only few occasions there were actual issues with that.
393;this movie is very comfortable to watch because of this.
394;it is all perfectly solvable with time and money and it's clear that wasn't present.
395;the film is very cool on its own, and obviously the fact the whole thing was filmed in a real jungle creates a lot of depth possibilities.
396;but converting a jungle properly .
397;Another great title to add you collection if you enjoy Arnold's movies.
398;The movie itself is great, however the codecs or region they used to encode this specific Blu.
399;Predator is arguably the most popular movie in the late '80's.
400;Director John McTiernan came up with inventive ways to keep the auidences tension alive in this now science fiction classic.
401;this was a very popular movie, because it was one of the first movies to have computer generation, good computer generation at that.
402;The special features are top notch compared to the last edition, because the last edition only had a trialer on it, which is not included in this edition.
403;This is just a milestone in film which is a very entertaining and frieghtening hour and forty minutes.
404;I loved the Predator movies when I was younger, so I bought the collectors edition.
405;WHen it comes in I open the package, and they didn't include the movie.
406;I got two discs of disc 2!
407;For the price this is a pretty good redo of the original.
408;(That lady has problems)I liked it because of three things: One Arnie is in it, Two Apollo Creed is in it so that kicks your moms A., and last but not least it is pretty cool.
409;I remember 'Predator' from many years ago when I was younger and remember enjoying it.
410;They find and neutralize the enemy camp, and Dillon's true motives are revealed.
411;The battle scenes are exciting, as they're filmed in such a way that puts the viewer into the action, rather than just watching it from the safety of your funky couch.
412;harden like the characters in the film.
413;The Predator costume looks very good, despite the age of the film and the technological advances since, so much credit goes to special effects artist extraordinaire Stan Winston.
414;what's more, Fox is commanding top dollar for this P. o. s. Suggested retail price is $29.95, a price range reserved for the higher end blu.
415;Though a bit violent this film is a great action film and at times is quite suspenseful.
416;though not as scary as Alien this new monster is really cool and has some great gadgetry.
417;schwarzenegger is great as Dutch the leader of the Strike team whose men are being slaughtered by the vicous predator which has a really cool cloaking device.
418;great action film,not to be missed!
419;and a wounded Governor Jessie The Body Ventura, I aint got time to bleed!This film by director John McTiernan is a fun, fast.
420;fi movie that gets better every time you see it.
421;It takes a pretty mean monster to make Schwarzenegger shake in his boots.
422;And it's armed to the teeth.
423;The jungle combat is deftly staged, and the characters are memorable and entertaining.
424;the big payoff comes when the creature is finally revealed.
425;Stan Winston and company designed one of the perfect movie villains, human or otherwise.
426;depth special edition, including some pictures or footage of the (hilarious) creature they ALMOST used.
427;Great extra features on the regular blu.
428;This is one of my favorite films.
429;The action is intense and the sound is awsome.
430;The predator itself is cool.
431;It is in my top three monster list, right alongside the Aliens from 'Aliens' and Pumpkinhead.
432;They're all Stan Winston's work and he's great.
433;Predaor is a great film with a Terrific monster!!!
434;It's actually a fun movie.
435;at least according to most of the reviewers here, whom I believe.
436;This movie is a rare gem in the industry.
437;The detail too on the Predator is outstanding for a movie that is 21 years old with great special effects especially the camoflauge scenes and camera work.
438;another great title to add you collection if you enjoy Arnold's movies.
439;This film is now available on a collector's edition if a wide range of special features including rare deleted scenes, never.
440;seen outtakes and 7 beautifully detailed behind.
441;and like most reviewers here, I highly recommend this for it's a rare gem, it's a classic compared to the science fiction/horror flicks around now.
442;Predator remains the premier action film of any era.
443;This film was ultra grainy before and quite detailed.
444;well the second was a gift from the devil.
445;Stay away if you value film.
446;I was honestly quite impressed at how good this movie looks.
447;McTiernan's audio commentary is pretty good as well.
448;There is a cool new documentary called If It Bleeds We Can Kill It where the cast and crew share all their stories from behind the scenes.
449;This includes both archive footage of Arnold, Jessie Ventura, and many others as well as new interviews with Carl Weathers, Shane Black, and McTiernan.
450;The most unique of these is one dedicated to Kevin Peter Hall, the late actor who played the Predator and also showed up briefly in the end of the film as a chopper pilot.
451;i do have a few minor complains with this special edition.
452;i encourage anyone who has never seen Predator to go pick this one up.
453;down Alien Vs. Predator movie, you might as well see one of the films that inspired it.
454;If you can sit through a mediocre franchise killer like that, you should at least go back and see the original.
455;i you are a true fan of Predator I really recommend the UK reg 2 version of this movie!
456;oh, this is a really great movie btw.
457;The movie itself is great.
458;ray edition, one that takes advantage of the format.
459;Tried multiple times, used cleaning solution, performed an exorcism, got squat.
460;This is enough of a classic action flick it should be done right.
461;I was a big Alien fan and I was a big Predator fan when it first release in Malaysia.
462;I felt there was something more towards this and waited and waited until.
463;received it, watched it and what can I say.
464;Just as good as I remember it being with one small thing that sort of surprised me.
465;fi sound is great and doesn't need much volume to be heard.
466;Anyway, the movie itself is great and even though there is some very graphic violence and language, it's a must.
467;That was the tagline I believe for this very smart, very fun movie.
468;At the time that was a very true statement.
469;I still remember the first time I saw this film.
470;The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant.
471;Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top.
472;From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released.
473;i tohught this movie had a pretty good story, good suspence and great action.
474;the predator himself was keeped pretty well hidden through out the movie and that sort of created a Jaws feel o the film.
475;over all a well made/planned movie.
476;restored master used for the previous release.
477;It's SUPPOSED to look this way.
478;ray destroys not only the grain, but ALL the detail as well.
479;The Most Dangerous Game, to which Predator bears a remarkable resemblance is a literary classic and mandatory reading in most ninth grade English classes.
480;McTiernan utilizes a clever tactic orginated (or at least to the best of my knowledge) by Steven Speilberg in Jaws by shooting from the predator's point of view.
481;Also noteworthy is Kevin Peter Hall as the villainous creature who is a constant menace and manages to make a very impressive impression even though we never see his face.
482;Sure the acting is merely adequate and the writing could use some sprucing up, especially in fleshing out the characters a little more, but the directing is superb and the finished product is about as good as anything you have the right to expect considering the genre.
483;Done by Stan Winston, who won recognition as being the best in his field after his work creating the digital dinosaurs in Speilberg's Jurassic Park, he does an equally impressive job here.
484;It's a fine line to walk and I can't think of anybody who does it any better.
485;I was pleasantly surprised to find it arrived in perfect condition with a Slipcover.
486;this is a good movie.
487;predator is in the top ten of best action movies of all time.
488;Subtle exploration of universal themes.
489;It looks great to me.
490;Yes the grain is quite noticeable on the studio's logo at the beginning of the film and in some night scenes, yet the movie is outstanding.
491;With the exception of the original Terminator , this is my favorite Arnold movie.
492;No, not great cinema but a terrific action packed popcorn movie,Great job on the Blu.
493;ray conversion and has a nice assortment of making the movie extras.
494;This the best Preditor film!
495;It's even better than Preditor 2!
496;The Preditor Alien is BETTER than the Alien from the movie Alien!
497;Awsome graphics,for an 80's movie!
498;The ending is so cool!
499;It has cool weapons from a M.16 Machine Gun with an Grenade Launcher!
500;,to a powerful Chain Gun!
501;What more do you need to know?Ok, yes, its one of the greatest sci.
502;fi action movies of the 80s and holds up exceptionally well by today's standards.
503;The special effects are still impressive and not overdone.
504;Lots of great cameos by other action stars (Carl Weathers and Jesse The Body Ventura) make this one to kick back and reminisce when sci.
505;There are few movie stars bigger than Arnold Schwarzenegger.
506;Sure, he's not the most talented member of Hollywood's elite, but he definitely knows how to entertain an audience.
507;exhilarating mixture of Alien and Rambo, Predator does not disappoint in the macho department.
508;style blades and scorching lasers.
509;one, the troops fall in gruesome fashion, until the climactic showdown in which primal instincts become the most powerful weapon.
510;when it wants to be, Predator is a thrilling mix of big bangs, treacherous landscapes and impressive special effects.
511;The Predator is a one of the best in a long line of killer aliens to come out of Hollywood.
512;Luckily, the pace picks up for an unforgettable final 20 minutes.
513;the film's greatest weakness comes from the brutally.
514;at the heart of Predator is a dissection of the senses.
515;Gotta love those 80's action flicks!Glad to see this one on Blu Ray.
516;got all the 80's classic on Blu Ray!
517;The story line in this movie is very interesting.
518;If you get this one you must also get Predator 2, they go together well.
519;Much better than the name suggests.
520;Great action from beginning to end.
521;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
522;ray, and Predator was a movie that I wanted to see in hi.
523;Well, I have now seen the Ultimate Hunter Edition, and the transfer was very good.
524;The Hunter Edition is fine.
525;Arnold was awesome in this movie.
526;this is one of my favorite movies of all times.
527;I thought that this was a great movie.
528;I recomend anybody that is a arnold fan or a action fan see this movie.
529;When the transfer is on its game, it looks fairly good, with its solidly reproduced fleshtones offset by often soft background coloring.
530;The good news is that the're both pretty active mixes, and though you can dicker and bicker about the subtle differences.
531;The real winner, however, is the depth and fullness of the macho posturing of the Alan Silvestri score.
532;Very happy with this release.
533;ray reminds me of a joke told by that masterful comedian, Louis C. k. He's on an airline flight and there's a momentary glitch in the movie his seat mate is watching.
534;this is a classic adventure, sci.
535;I used to consider myself a film purist but I guess I no longer can because I really enjoyed this 'digital noise reduction' version of the film.
536;For film, grain IS good.
537;If they did it right the first time, and used the proper codec and bitrate (due to having the 50GB dual.
538;wanting to satisfy fans and milk this franchise for all it's worth (since they left out all of the special features on the last Blu.
539;ray), they decided to clean up the picture, put back all of the special features, and give a little sneak peek to the new 'Predators' movie.
540;ray (with the best picture possible and all of the special features), so i decided to give the disc a try.
541;But damn, the picture looks so gorgeous now.
542;Give the screen shots a look and judge for yourself.
543;The detail looks very well preserved, which is the ONLY reason I recommend this release.
544;Once the action starts, the film looks beautiful .
545;and the sound is amazing.
546;the clarity of it is absolutely beautiful.
547;So yet another original bare bones blu ray release finally gets the decent treatment it so rightly deserves.
548;def in a number of places, this looks pretty immaculate throughout.
549;Black levels are also greatly improved.
550;I felt that for the most part the picture looked much more naturally hi.
551;But this I'm sure will be up to what you prefer.
552;It's a brilliantly balanced track, giving great clarity and detail in the quieter scenes, exploding into hefty machine gun fire and explosions later on that pound your speakers without ever sounding too overbearing.
553;This is by far my favorite action film ever made.
554;While the story line doesn't hold up to scrutiny and the characters are somewhat stereotypical, this film is so good because it has so much action right off the bat, a huge shoot out with a terrorist camp all within the first 30 minutes or so.
555;I think this is one of Mr. Schwarzeneggers better 'acting' performances, he truly lookes terrified of the Predator, of course Arnold will play it off modestly and say he was truly afraid of it but well I still think the acting is really good.
556;the Predator creature design, I think, is one of the best movie monsters/characters ever made along the lines of Alien and Pumpkinhead.
557;and I still felt I got jipped.
558;The sound is well done, it could stand to have a new master of the sound.
559;amazing Alien vs. Predator crossover, but the original Predator?
560;for somebody who has never seen or even remembers the release of Predator, may be shocked to here that it earned a pretty good box.
561;office and general critical reaction to the film was positive.
562;to be honest, I think that Predator is an overlooked gem that brings back some of that 80's, action film nostalgia that so many people unconciously strive to find.
563;Many images, which have become iconic in modern cinema, actually have roots in Predator.
564;predator is also one of those films that improves with age.
565;It's almost refreshing to see an old style action movie that doesn't feel like a cliche, simply because it's one of those movies that has actually created those cliches to begin with.
566;if you're an action movie fan who loves Terminator, Die Hard, and Aliens then this movie is for you.
567;If you're not really that type of moviegoer, I think Predator works well enough to actually make a space in your heart for this kind of film.
568;I am not a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger but he was fine in this film.
569;The explosions were deep and boomy, gunfire accurately whizzed about the surround speakers, and Arnold's Oscar worthy dialogue was crisp and clear.
570;The depth of field really brought you into the jungle with Arnie.
571;Overall I was very impressed with this release and look forward to other Schwarzenegger flicks to get similar treatment.
572;This movie was one of the greatest sci.
573;It has action suspense and it gave birth to the next generation of sci.
574;Tons of noise, color flutuation and light changes/artifacting.
575;ray releases and I understand why.
576;I am a huge fan of this franchise, and was incredibly excited to see this in hi.
577;ray I expect a pristine picture and sound.
578;Fox/MGM I hope you're listening.
579;Even now, Predator is arguably one of my favorite action.
580;science fiction classics that I still watch today.
581;arnold is excellent once again as the macho protagonist main character in an action movie.
582;While I've had mixed opinions of their views, I still love watching them in their roles in Predator.
583;although the age does show in some spots, the special effects are absolutely impressive especially taking into account that this was 1987!
584;He enjoys if the movie very much
585;It is the most beautifully rendered Blu Ray I have ever seen, and I have state.
586;It's one thing that you've got a film with a kick [.]
587;Even within the first 5 minutes of the film, you've got Arnold and Carl Weathers bulging their biceps while engaging in a very manly handshake .
588;one by one, in scenes of suspense, chases, and more gunfire, the units die one by one, until it is just Arnold vs the Predator.
589;in the end, Predator is a very entertaining 90 minutes spent.
590;This is pure adrenaline action and suspense.
591;Believe me, I have a 12 foot projection screen and use a high definition projector and Blu Ray player, so I do see the difference.
592;Excellent to watch on a rainy day even after you've seen it a dozen times!
593;There are no in yr face pop outs but the depth of field conveyed is great.
594;Jurassic Park is another great conversion.
595;Those races that make it to space would have the intelligence and capacity to engage new races more amicably than depicted.
596;one of the Arnold's brawny best puts most modern action films to shame for sheer high testosterone impact, executed with muscular style and vigour by Director John McTiernan.
597;It remains a fine action thriller, not at all what I expected, never having heard of the film.
598;I like this move so much.
599;I order it from time to time to see it again.
600;so i put in and enjoying Arnie and his group in action.
601;Where did Jim and John Thomas find the inspiration to create something like this?!
602;And not just great script but the design of Predator is out of this world.
603;Only the final battle between Schwarzenegger and Predator is worth at least 10 watcing.
604;It's a 1987 action movie of a group of guys who they call specialist.
605;So just relax and enjoy what it's meant to be.
606;This is one of those films that made Arnold Schwarzenegger the superstar he is today.
607;Predator is an excellent sci.
608;This a great movie to watch on those days that you are really bored.
609;I think the real star of this movie is the predator itself.
610;It has been depicted in numerous comics and games since the movie was released.
611;A very original and creative character.
612;This a very entertaining movie, and a great one to own.
613;Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu Ray is excellent.
614;I bought the single disc blu ray and this is the best i've seen Predator look and sound.
615;with a 5.1 surround sound system its completely got that theater feel to it.
616;I really enjoyed the making of predator documentary.
617;Yeah, the plot isn't very complex, but it's handled in a very intense manner .
618;Jim and John Thomas brings up some suspenseful conspiracy stuff about evil CIA agents in league with the guerillas and Russian agents.
619;fortunately John McTiernan adds huge bucketfuls of suspense and gory horror along the way.
620;The other characters are sparingly but well.
621;Predator has some holes and a rather simple plot, but the superb direction and cinematography are pretty darn brilliant.
622;I can still remember first seeing this movie and saying to myself.
623;The music score, the suspense, the hot jungle, the invisible evil thing, and no cops to come to your rescue.
624;I'm happy I did not pay much for it.
625;Okay, Predator is a great flick for guys of all ages.
626;eyes heroine (ok, it's a minor role, but that's fine by me!)
627;The plot is pretty easy to follow .
628;a bunch of soldiers are sent on a rescue mission in the jungle, but they end up being hunted by some unknown and pretty powerful force.
629;And it's great fun, especially for Arnold fans.
630;And given the number of gunfire sequences and explosions in this movie, your speakers will get a lovely workout.
631;Predator is a hybrid, a combination of an action flick coupled with sc.
632;The plot is a bit basic but it works.
633;The scenery is lovely, if you like jungles.
634;this remains a favorite of mine.
635;Alien was a more ambitious film.
636;I rate them as entertainment equals.
637;characters are well defined and (despite not talking much) you actually care about them.
638;probably Arnolds most appropriate casting.
639;special fx have yet to show there age.
640;First time viewing is very intense.
641;Definitly gives a theater feel.
642;fi Horror classic that deserves the same reverence that Alien has received.
643;I remember watching this movie in 1987 (when I was 12) and just saying, Wow.
644;Arnold was the man back in the 80's and it had a terrific cast of characters.
645;The plot is about as simple as it gets.
646;Every character in the film is interesting and has their own little style.
647;The gatling gun he used in this movie has now become legend and still impressive to this day.
648;Just seeing Ventura in the movie at all is quite amusing, but he plays the role very well.
649;Arnold is actually better here than I have seen him in most of his action films.
650;The Predator is a fierce and incredible hunter.
651;By now most of you know about the alien and it's weapons and what it can do.
652;I must give a huge nod to Stan Winston for maybe saving this movie by creating an incredible Predator.
653;If you watch the special features, you will be shocked at what the first Predator actually looked like.
654;This is Arnold at his best and this spawned the directorial career of John McTiernan (Die Hard).
655;This movie is so enjoyable to watch that I have seen it more times than I can count.
656;Go get this nice special edition as soon as you can.
657;special Features: Well, at least we finally get a special edition of this great movie.
658;There is a documentary on the making of the film, which is pretty decent.
659;They are each kinda short, but are informative.
660;This blu ray edition is well done ONCE past the Ken doll beginning.
661;arnold and Carl both look like perfect Ken dolls in the beginning of the film, but during the helicopter ride into the jungle the blu ray becomes real pops with depth, sound and color.
662;The jungle scenes are really outstanding.
663;predator is a classic and for the price totally worth adding to your collection.
664;those who are satisfied with just the movie alone, this R.1 edition is good enough.
665;is a great cast of characters and dramatic scenes.
666;what a great way to add tension to the scene.
667;Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job of being both tough and in control.
668;remarkably, for a film over 23 years old, the special effects don't seem dated at all.
669;That's another great thing about the way the movie was made .
670;generated graphics, the filmmakers used the technology they had in creative ways to accomplish what they needed.
671;The result is more subtle and interesting, including not knowing what the Predator looks like until the end rather than shooting dozens of closeup shots of CG Predators.
672;if you haven't seen it, definitely check it out.
673;I'd love to take you up on that bet about this being the only movie w/ 2 future Governors in it.
674;as for the movie itself, I love 'Predator' and think it is one of Ahnuld's best movies.
675;this movie is the ultimate terrific science.
676;fiction thriller that was released in 1987.
677;Also included are a frame by frame description that show the making of the movie in frame to frame detail.
678;Even though I slightly prefer the sequel, the original is still creepy and entertaining.
679;I got to say that this is one of the few movies in which Arnold gives a very good performance.
680;The supporting cast is good as well: who would have thought that Jesse Ventura could act?
681;The action is solid
682;And of course, the Predator is the real star in this film
683;Guns aplenty, with Jesse taking the lead with his hand carried gattling gun.
684;The predator is without a doubt the greatest movie ever.
685;Overall this is the greatest movie i have ever seen.
686;Used sparingly, DNR can be a good thing.
687;in this case it practically turned a great action movie into a Pixar computer generated movie.
688;sure, the picture is pristine.
689;For the first edition a new encoding from the best elements should have been done.
690;Instead the picture has been scrubbed clean and most of the fine detail is gone.
691;get it right for the movie's 25th anniversary.
692;The Predatoris the most mind blowing movie i have seen in thelast 20 years.
693;to me it is like going to a football game and having fun,letting your hair down, and suddenly understanding that you yourself are the ball and that players of both teams are bearing down upon you to have possession of you.
694;for those of you not aquainted with the film PredatorI will quickly elaborate it for you.
695;arnold Schwarzenegger,whose character in the movie is Dutch,is the leader of a crack task force which generally engage in affairs of extraordinary nature.
696;being the crack demolition/seek and destroy squad they are,we see them easily moving into top gear and rolling over the terrorists with a minimum of fuss or opposition.
697;this being has stealth technology and laser weaponry and is able to evade the high powered weapons of Dutch and his team.
698;dutch does confront it in one of the most original and rivetting scenes in movie history with the predator at one stage grabbing Dutch by the throat and lifting him to his eyelevel(the Pedator is after all seven and a half feet tall).
699;Its rich in detail and much clearer then any other version I seen before.
700;Having a clear update look of Predator, you can see how this movie was made.
701;Predator is Arnold s best movie from the 80s, followed by the T1 and Conan the Barbarian on the third place.
702;Easily one of the best action movies ever made.
703;, and a really cool rasta alien.
704;The greatest action movie ever made.
705;I am sure I will still love it when I get to look at it.
706;It doesn't disappoint, such a great film.
707;This film has great effects and the story is good.
708;came new and in great conditions.
709;PREDATOR is a real classic!!!!!
710;i saw this movie more than 30 times through my life, and it still amazes me how good the story, the characters and the Predator are.
711;while i still think ALIEN is the coolest alien character ever, the PREDATOR creature shines on this movie!!!!!
712;This one is a true classic!!!!!!!
713;I remember seeing this movie for the first time, and not really understanding it (I was a kid).
714;Now I can truly appreciate the film and how it launched the folklore of the Predator, which has become a film star in its own right.
715;Dialog while intentionally over the top still offends.
716;Mission accomplished, the team are suddenly being targeted by an alien creature picking them off one at a time.
717;the special effects and the action are well done here.
718;The suspense and the vast amount of blood are relivent throughout the film.
719;I love the scene when the Predator shoots off a soldier's arm and then the arm is still triggering the gun.
720;The guy has the best lines.
721;Predator is filled with flair and the pace is outstanding.
722;It had a very specific look that the director and Director of Photography put a lot of effort into getting.
723;when a film becomes a classic (and I wouldn't really call Predator a classic) it's a film that people should (theoretically) want to see in the form it became a classic in or as close to it as possible.
724;I'd love to get a version of that on Blu.
725;scrubbed version with new scenes and visual effects.
726;(OK, a couple might understand but still prefer it this way.
727;this movie is a great action thriller.
728;Great Action adventure of the 80's and Arnold is great in this movie.
729;Would recommend to anyone who likes these kind of movies.
730;It is a piece of Americana.
731;AndIt also had Jessie Ventura!
732;It's one of my all time favorite movies.
733;This created artifacts and digital noise.
734;ray, and maybe use a conservative amount of grain reduction.
735;Oh man, I love this movie.
736;alien successfully mixed the horror genre with the sci.
737;fi genre, and Predator has accomplished an amazing thing as well, Predator successfully mixed the action genre with the sci.
738;And what better way to do that than to get one of the greatest action heroes of all time, good old Ahnold.
739;And what better person to do the special affects for a movie than the legend himself Stan Winston, and they got both.
740;And mix it with a great story and add John McTiernan (the dude who directed Die Hard) as director, you have one awesome flick.
741;the special effects are top notch in this film
742;the musical score for the movie was fantastic as well.
743;last but not least, a lot of the credit has to go to Kevin Peter Hall who portrayed the Predator in this film.
744;He made the character come to life, and his battles with Arnold were terrific.
745;He was a very talented actor who will be missed.
746;all in all, this movie is my favorite sci.
747;It has it all with some to spare.
748;but the jungle shots, and most of the movie, look great.
749;All things considered, if you like this movie, this is easily the edition to own.
750;The movie itself is a classic.
751;The blu ray was a real treat because i previously only had it on VHS so the clarity was amazing.
752;star reviews here, but mine looks fine.
753;This is a gritty film, literally and figuratively .
754;Until the Smithsonian recognizes Predator as the significant piece of filmmaking history it is, a true frame.
755;frame artisanal restoration of of the original film is unlikely.
756;This is the best Predator will probably ever look.
757;times masterpieces: Predator, Die Hard, Hunt For Red October.
758;All three let subtle clues tell very important parts of the story, without beating you over the head with them.
759;i hope when John McTiernan gets out of prison, the Hollywood machine allows him to make films like this again.
760;Plus the cgi and makeup are more believable than any Transformer film.
761;Also the behind the scenes are packed full of coke fueled masculinity and pissing matches.
762;But it delivered like Arnold does!
763;The best action of schwarzenegger.
764;Every actor is pumped up.
765;It has tough dialogue, big guns, and lots of macho action.
766;Throw in a cool alien with amazing special effects and you have pure guy movie nirvana.
767;the cast of this film was perfect.
768;It was a real ensemble piece with Schwarzenegger in the lead.
769;He didn't have to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and they helped elevate the level of acting and characterization.
770;He seems more than a physical match for Schwarzenegger and he definitely acts better.
771;His quiet, intense gaze said more than anything else he did.
772;You had American Indian Sonny Landham as Billy, the guy with the haunting laugh.
773;the effects of Predator were also remarkable.
774;The alien was definitely a guy in a rubber mask, but the helmet, dreadlocks, and mandibles made him one of the more amazing looking aliens in movie history.
775;The character was a real high point in Stan Winston's career.
776;the music by Alan Silvestri was also unique and a perfect blend of military march and horror suspense to give the movie the right feel.
777;this is one of those rare movies where everything came together just right to make a fun film.
778;The actors, director, effects, music, and everything fit together just right to make one of the best popcorn flicks ever made.
779;There are a ton of extras and bonus features that I had never seen before.
780;This is an extended documentary on the making of the film.
781;They include the special weapons from the film, the casting, the camouflage makeup, the Predator suit, Kevin Peter Hall, shooting in the jungle, and more.
782;It was good to see they went with the design they did.
783;Again, there are all sorts of cool stuff for Predator fans here.
784;One outtake shows Anna picking up a chameleon in the forest.
785;Bottom line: This Ultimate Hunter Edition on BD has the best picture of all of them.
786;Movie the most manly and macho movie ever besides almost everything else Arnold has done.
787;Best one liners in history:Stick Around!
788;Predator 2 one of the greatest follow.
789;This movie is great I was amazed at the actors then and now .
790;I was amused the entire time .
791;Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my favorite moves.
792;This movie stands out in other ways, too: the Predator is extremely well.
793;done, with more and more slowly being revealed over the course of the movie.
794;The characters are MUCH more distinct than those in other horror/action movies without falling into any stereotypes, and there is a genuine feeling of comraderie between them.
795;The way the actors do everything feels very authentic, and gives the impression that they really are experienced military troops.
796;The whole shallow plot but extremely well.
797;overall, a very cool ride, despite the paper.
798;One stays behind, buffing on a cigar, his red shirt bulging with the owners massive, well developed muscle.
799;There's an outline of something tall and not friendly.
800;It was well made and has great effects that still hold up today.
801;Stan Winston's creature design helped made this movie amazing.
802;The popularity of this film spawned a sequel and it even merged with the Alien franchise.
803;This is still a good movie after all this time.
804;It has a good cast and lots of suspense and action.
805;ray comes across as pretty nice.
806;There are a lot of special features that are pretty good too.
807;ray and you like the movie, go ahead and get it.
808;This is a great film and oneof Arnold's best.
809;disc collector's edition has goodpicture and sound plus many cool extras.
810;Arnold hit his peak with the release of Predator .
811;a great cast of some known and not so known actors.
812;Billy, the Indian especially is a strong character.
813;Carl Weathers is strong in a non.
814;Predator is an awesome action flick of the 80's period.
815;The jungle's environments have never looked better and the special effects are beautiful on Blu.
816;Overall, Predator is amazing on Blu.
817;also to add on, I hope Fox puts out great Blu.
818;ray editions of the Alien series The Abyss, and True Lies as these are great films that never saw Blu.
819;Well worth the price, which was nominal, compared to other vendors
820;Special effects and stunts are top notch.
821;Good story line and a LOT of firepower!
822;ray, released on June 29, 2010Predator is an iconic movie that started a series that led to another series of Alien vs Predator.
823;there are multiple detailed making.
824;Hunters of Extreme Perfection feature that goes through the first two movies and the creation of a script written with a part for Arnold taking Predator back to the jungle on another planet that got sidelined when it was decided to go into an Aliens versus Predators format instead.
825;Finally, there is also a sneak peek of the new film, Predators seeing some background footage and explanation of the premise.
826;ray and it looks fantastic when you watch it.
827;This is one of arney's earlier films, and let me tell you it ducking rocks.
828;The movie also has some pretty darn cool special effects.
829;This is one of my all time favorite movies, and whenever a new viewing format comes out, this is one of those titles that I will usually upgrade sometime after they put it out on the new format.
830;I have been watching this movie since I was in high school, and it's absolutely one of my all time favorites.
831;Anyway, this will always be one of my absolute favorites, along with the likes of such movies asAlien [Blu.
832;ray or anything, but it's still cool.
833;And the sound is absolutely fantastic too!
834;The purists are right in that DNR has been liberally applied, etc etc.
835;I had so much fun with the main picture and then dove right into the extra features, including the part about how the film was made.
836;I smiled all the way through the feature as the actors and directors lightheartedly explained their roles in the making of the movie in their own words.
837;This was probabaly the greatest movie ever created, think about it.
838;cuz its got an awesome ending!
839;Arnold did a great movie here fighting against the beast.
840;for the most part, the transfer of sound and picture is excellent.
841;Most of the scences look crystal sharp with great color on my large.
842;Most of the night scenes, however, are crystal clear and sharp with fantastic contrast.
843;nonetheless, this exciting, suspenseful, classic Arnold film deserves a high.
844;I remember viewing this on VHS HI.
845;fI Dolby Surround when it first came out and at that time it was considered by many to be a great test of your sourround system.
846;Well many years have passed, and watching this again on blue ray is amazing.
847;As for the sound, the DTS Master audio track is superb!
848;Awesome surround effects that utilize every speaker, and the LFE effect is very balanced.
849;Sort of how The Dark Knight's LFE is done and you know how good that is.
850;Well, this movie doesn't deserve 5 stars, it probably deserves only 4 but the humor in the movie caused by Arnold, probably accidentally makes it worthy of 5 stars.
851;But without Ahnold's stupid humor, there's actually a good classic movie here.
852;But, some great action scenes, the creation of a new, original, classic, and awesome vilain, and some cheesy one liners by the governator make this one a great movie.
853;Predator has achieved though all these years a cult status, due this intriguing, absorbing, bloody but extremely effective sci fi.
854;To fight against an elusive who invisibly displaces from wrench to wrench and is capable to detect (as the snakes do) the human being through a formidable thermal sensor, will convey the viewer to a very engaging portrait of devastation in the middle of the jungle.
855;the final confrontation may be regarded as one of the most extraordinary ones in the history of cinema.
856;One of Arnold's better movies.
857;The action never stops, and the ending is perfection.
858;The best musical score I've seen in a movie.
859;My favorite character has to be Blain, with his memorable quotes, and his minigun gun!
860;I first saw this awesome action movie when in came out on Video,and it's still great today.
861;a great cast heads a movie which never has a dull moment, and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you learn what the characters learn and are kept up to speed.
862;a great, fun movie that has a good sequel.
863;Not a great sequel, but a good one.
864;the sound and picture is breathtaking i don't think Predator could get any better.
865;ray was a monumental upgrade compared to other conversions performed back when Blu.
866;A MUST have with many extras!
867;Excellent clarity of picture and sound.
868;this is a very well constructed story.
869;I watched this new copy and enjoyed it all over again.
870;this and the original Alien are two of my favorite story lines.
871;Predator is my favorite Schwarzenegger flick, closely followed by Commando.
872;It has the usual stuff I like in an action film .
873;pusher and watch the film again.
874;excellent film, always fun to watch
875;After starring as one of the most iconic and unstoppable villains ever in Terminator, it was high time that Arnie had a worthy foe to fight against.
876;And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.
877;This is definitely a man's movie.
878;as soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees.
879;The first rescue team is found disemboweled and skinned.
880;All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home.
881;Not so simple when a high.
882;This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.
883;Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere.
884;the final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether.
885;McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape.
886;definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie.
887;It think it's a brilliant look for the film.
888;mA sound design is amazing though, and will surely convince your neighbors that a war has broken out next door.
889;But it is a lot more fascinating to see how this action film works on many fears and creates an unevadable mesmerization and panic, even if we know the hero will succeed.
890;The fears are, among others : the fear of the jungle, the fear of wild animals like scorpions, the fear of rebels and revolutionaries, the fear of the night, the fear of the alien, the extra.
891;terrestrial monster, the fear of the ugly face of a predator from outer space, forgetting that the beautiful face of a human is also the face of a predator, and that is why the hero can succeed and destroy the alien.
892;The suspense and the rhythm of the action is quick enough to create a real momentum and the ingenuity of the hero is always surprising and amazing.
893;He destroys a perfect killing machine with sticks and logs, with a few pieces of wire and string, even if he also uses some better weapons to lure the monster into his trap.
894;This is one of Schwarzenegger's best films.
895;This film has suspense, action, laughs.
896;I understand some of the criticisms, but overall I'm happy with the restoration done on this movie.
897;my (likely unpopular) opinion is this is a good restoration of an older film.
898;Predator, directed by Die Hard's John McTiernan, is a masterpiece of the action.
899;fi genre and arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, the film that showcase's Arnold's action skills and Mr. Oylmpia physique.
900;Stan Winston, the creature's designer,has outdone himself and created one of the most awesome aliens in sci.
901;the special effects are astounding and with all the computer enhanced effects today, predator walks away with some of the most orginal special effects is history, appropriate to the story, the jungle, and the action, with ultraviolet filters and the predator recording all the human dialogue and then echoed at another point in the movie.
902;A classic, that any action lover should own and re.
903;I think it was under rated at the time and after seeing it again for at least the tenth time, I'm sure it will last and is a classic and Arnold will never do anything better.
904;For Predator, intensity is its middle name and John McTiernan continues his run of first class action flims.
905;A great ensemble cast including Bill Duke and Gov. Jesse Ventura!
906;terrestial experience than the Alien movies, Director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger (in a role perfectly suited to him) offer an engaging blend of action and science fiction.
907;Unsurprisingly, they emerge completely unscatched but utterly annihilate the rebels, with a suitable amount of exploding grass shacks and Arnie one.
908;up zone, things really start to heat up.
909;the acting is uniformly solid, from the nervous Richard Chaves as Poncho to the geeky Shane Black as Hawkins (with his supply of jokes that always seem to involve his girlfriend's netherparts) and Sonny Landham as the all.
910;invisible creature able to camouflage itself in the jungle.
911;It loves to skin humans to death.
912;So overall, its an improvement, and worth 3 stars.
913;I saw this movie a while ago and I still love it and is the best predator movie.
914;This is a great action movie and has a good story and an interesting villian.
915;bottom line another good action movie.
916;This will be my first time posting something that I bought from Amazon.
917;And boi I was really amazed with the clarity of this version.
918;The transfer for this edition is really amazing and superb with a wonderful audio transfer as well.
919;Dun think much and order this immediately, its really worth it.
920;Amazing release for a even more amazing movie.
921;the movies itself is great if you like anrold or 80s action flicks.
922;If you do however its great.
923;It also has plenty of classic one.
924;Augmenting the classic FX were new optical effects
925;Suspenseful pacing aided by the Alan Silvestri score keeps things moving, and the film is just plain fun, even if it's completely unbelievable.
926;Arnold was right when he said, I liked the idea of starting out with an action.
927;Lots of bonus features on this 2.
928;predator is a better movie, First Blood is a better film.
929;These ingredients created one of the best science fiction action movies of all time.
930;By far one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films with the utmost respect going toward the late great Kevin Peter Hall
931;It is one of a kind.
932;The last time I saw Predator was when I was pretty young and at that time I loved it.
933;Luckily age has been very good to the film being that it was even better then I remembered.
934;fi flicks go this is by far one of the best.
935;It has just the right amount of sci.
936;this is a tremendous flick.
937;It has everything you need, especially if you are a guy.
938;I would absolutely recommend Predator for any fan of the genre.
939;From the first frame you know that this film is going to produce the goods.
940;Rocky's mate), and pay attention to the rest of the film.
941;superbly staged action with some of the coolest scenes you will ever see on film, this is not one to be missed.
942;the Pedator's cackle is by far the best sound ever captured on screen/sound, judge for yourself, anytime.
943;They cleaned up the film and looks crisp.
944;The sound is clean and clear as well.
945;Add to that the fact that the monster was 100's of years more technologically advanced than humans, and you have a incredibly engrossing story.
946;Definitely one for the permanent collection.
947;I've seen this movie and any movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jessie Venture, and Carl Wethers is defenetly worth seeing.
948;This movie is Rambo meets Alien with alot of effects thrown in and alot of surprises along the way.
949;If you liked Terminator, T2, the Alien movies and the Rambo saga you'll like this
950;believe me, when the movie turned, that turn made it all the more enjoyable in a way that can't be repeated.
951;Take the kids, because the markets are very family friendly and they have these great Hawaiian Ice stands.
952;Predator unseals a whole tin of whoop.
953;I don't know how but this is actually better than my 2D version.
954;Gov Venture has about 5 lines, all of them bring a tear to my eye.
955;It was a good movie if you like Arnold.
956;i like it cause it had a lot of action from start to finish.
957;this is the original predator and I liked this the best out of all of them.
958;they are all good, but I like scwarzenegers performance in this.
959;he's great and puts up a great fight.
960;Oh, and they also cut most of the special features for the Blu.
961;Outstanding story, action, setttings, and characters.
962;It opens a whole new class of story.
963;this movie is 15 years old and is still my favorite action film.
964;em up flick, but then turns into a psychological game of cat and mouse between Ahhnold and the Alien predator.
965;It is the best transfer so far of this movie available in any video format.
966;it is anything but perfect but it still looks pretty good for an action film from the 80's.
967;It's Arnold at his peak in a movie with great special effects and a great supporting cast.
968;Predator is one of the best action films ever made, aswell as one of the best monster movies ever made.
969;The creature effects handled by the best monster creator ever, Stan Winston, are extremely terrifying and fun!
970;the other actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and others play their roles with great energy and each character has his or her own set of characteristics.
971;Arnold plays Dutch, a great Major, who leads his team threw the jungles only to be taken one.
972;one by the creature, in classic monster movie fashion.
973;It's amazing all the way through.
974;All the extras included are great addition that enhance the film.
975;An amazing movie such as this deserves better attention to detail and care in the packaging department.
976;Heroes should always be like this, where they get hurt, killed and when they win it's after an intense battle with the enemy.
977;Predator does that and follows a great storyline.
978;I love this movie, always have.
979;It's an exciting and original science fiction movie.
980;The movie is gory and violent but it's also always fun and entertaining.
981;The director John McTiernan was at the top of his game as well.
982;This is his best movie I think next to Die Hard and the Hunt for Red October.
983;Great classic action flick I have always loved this movie arnold is the greatest action hero of all time hands down
984;This film has always been one of my favorites from Arnold, ever since I was 12 years old.
985;fi/action/suspense movie with a pot full of astonishing actors.
986;I give credit to the directors of this film for choosing such an excellent cast.
987;The latter of the two is somewhat rare.
988;Many scenes really capture the effects of the THX which adds to the climax and the recessive parts of the movie.
989;Great movie by a great director, played by a great cast.
990;She got everything Uncle John Needs!
991;TheMovie is full of quotes.
992;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
993;I give this movie 5 stars because both Ah Nuld and Jesse have moved on to better things.
994;Nothing else comes close to the excitement of this series, in my humble opinion.
995;From the director of Die Hard comes one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies.
996;Predator is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.
997;The scene where the predator is chasing Arnold and he covers himself with mud and clay so that the predators infrared vision doesn't see him is probably the scene that I find most memorable, but the whole movie is filled with great parts.
998;He's got cool weapons, and he can walk around in stealth mode so that he's nearly invicible.
999;office success and fan base.
1000;There are some gore in this movie that may not be for the squeamish, but it's action and pacing never lets down the viewer especially with it's good special effects, the creature itself is quite a unique kind of alien monster that is fully armed with invisibility mode and all kinds of deadly weapons designed and created by Stan Winston.
1001;The features on disc 2 are just cool, it has featurettes, documentary, Never.
1002;terror comes in many forms, but so does action, and Predator successfully combines both.
1003;This is a smart action/horror/thriller that doesn't fall back on cliches, but pushes forward, aware that it may be following such films as Alien (1979) but yet only improving upon the presented material.
1004;The Predator is a work of genius.
1005;Not only is he the perfect opponent, he helps make the movie.
1006;A lot of the film's positive elements come from the lush Cambodian jungles, the haunting direction by McTiernan, the ultimate macho combat role by Arnold, the paranoia and startlingly effective idea of the remote settings.
1007;Much of it also comes from the fact that the alien, when finally revealed, looks real.
1008;It looks real, all right, and also pretty darn horrifying.
1009;for me, Predator is one of the best action films of all time.
1010;Another great thing is that it is sort of Hitchcockian in a way
1011;When it finally does show us the creature, we're shocked.
1012;The idea of the two species joining together for a feature film was hinted at in Predator 2 (1990), then hinted at even further with a line of comic books, fan fiction, and great videogames.
1013;Very sweet movie, one of my favorite Arnold action classics.
1014;Everyone of the main 8 characters does a good job of acting (even Sonny Landham who I recently learned was a porn star).
1015;The special effects will still stand up today against modern action pictures.
1016;par of what I would expect.
1017;The deleted scene + outtakes are pretty interesting along with the test footage and other featurettes.
1018;Still a great movie with cool characters and an awesome looking Stan Winston monster!!!!
1019;if your one for suspense this is about as good as it gets!
1020;This movie is way cool AND the special features included in this set are actually worth watching.
1021;The making of's are pretty interesting.
1022;This movie has ( for the time ) great FX, an easy to follow story plot, lots of gunfire, one of the most classic alien creatures of all time, and Jesse The Body Ventura.
1023;Predator is by far my favorite movie ever, it is the epitome of everything that was great about 80's action films.
1024;men, Dillion does what government agents do best, LIE!
1025;the fight between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Peter Hall, a. k. a. the Predator, is of epic 80's proportions.
1026;i can't make you like this movie, but i'm sure after one watch you'll see why this is one of the most enduring movie characters of all time.
1027;I thought i would invest in the region 1 version to get the full cut.
1028;now though, a special edition uncut two disc version has just been released in the UK, with all kinds of extras and bits on it in a flashy box.
1029;so watch it as soon as you get it.
1030;His team helps with the rest and they find this chick and take her prisoner.
1031;The only reason while Arnold doesn't die is because he's the main character and the USA likes happy endings.
1032;This movie is way more believable than AVP and Predator 2.
1033;but those movies are still pretty great.
1034;This is one of the best action movies ever.
1035;A good movie for Arnold fans.
1036;A must see prequel to watching Aliens versus Predators.
1037;Although it has been morethan twenty seven years since its release, this is the best PREDATOR.
1038;It is over the top macho, what we used to call in the service a Tiger Flic .
1039;This is the best movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done.
1040;the special effects are amazing its a thrill ride you will never get tired of watching this movie.
1041;this is one of the best sci.
1042;fi movies ever made and like i said the special effects are awesome and its a movie that will keep you guessing and guessing.you will always love this movie no matter what.
1043;One of Schwarzenegger's classic action flicks.
1044;A great mix of action, wise.
1045;The predator effects were excellent.
1046;Probably one of the greatest movie quotes for military personnel to use.
1047;Tghis and Aliens are the first best Scifi series ever created Next to Godzilla and Critters.
1048;Arnold did a great role.
1049;If you like action movies predator is for you.
1050;the special effects are magnificent.
1051;He is just a strong and fierce as the alien.
1052;this is the best action movie I have ever seen.
1053;One of the greatest aspects of the Blu.
1054;ray format is it allows you to view films for the first time as they were intended to look: like films!
1055;What Fox should have done is create a new master going back to the original negatives, and perhaps SPARINGLY applied some DNR by people who knew what they were doing to sort out the inconsistencies of the grain in the first release.
1056;I bought this movie because I am hooked on the clean high definition look!!!
1057;For me it takes an awesome movie and adds more AWESOMENESS!
1058;I saw absolutely NO compromise of the picture and I watched on a 60 LED screen.
1059;It has something bigger than Arnold in it!
1060;It is superb and is a classic.
1061;After achieving great critical and commercial success with the 1979 film Alien and its follow.
1062;As the team of commandos gets picked off one by one, Dutch eventually finds himself face.
1063;with the great success of Predator, director John McTiernan proved himself the right man to bring Fox's newest monster franchise to life.
1064;It is somewhat surprising that 20th Century Fox entrusted their hopes of a new franchise with McTiernan, since he had yet to truly prove himself in Hollywood (it was 1 year later when McTiernan was propelled into superstardom with his Bruce Willis actioner Die Hard), but even without having much experience under his belt he succeeded with flying colors.
1065;the story for the film is essentially summed up by the film's title Predator, with that one word, and the fact that Arnold was the main star, most people knew that there's bound to be plenty of action to go around.
1066;the acting was good for an action film, not Oscar worthy, but these types of movies never are.
1067;Arnold's mastery of the English language had improved from his performance in 1984's The Terminator, at least you can understand him better, but it's by no means perfect.
1068;The cast does well with their respective characters, some of the performances were a little over the top in places, most were clich d, but so were their characters, and what else would you expect in an action film.
1069;one of the biggest praises that can be given to this movie is for the special effects work
1070;The use of infrared for the Predator's vision was a neat touch and somewhat surprising for the audience to actually be given the monster's view of the world.
1071;The costume department did what was possibly the best job in special effects for the movie with their work on the Predator costume.
1072;The costume was so realistic, it was clear that the creative team on this movie had payed close attention to Alien and Aliens in terms of bringing monsters to life.
1073;with all that being said, Predator is definitely a classic among action movies and monster movies for that matter (though this film is more action oriented), and is a film that fans of the `Alien' franchise should definitely watch.
1074;Predator is rated R for violence and language.
1075;This is a total classic, great action and great effects!
1076;One of the best movies to come out of the 80's.
1077;This has got to be one of the coolest monster movies ever made!
1078;The cast is great and the creature is THE coolest (technologically advanced) alien ever!
1079;Full of 80s quotes, action, everything is good 80s movie needs.
1080;Predator is definetly one of the most enjoyable sci.
1081;Plus there's no fun features except a trailor.
1082;I got it for $7.99, which for one of the best action movies of all time is a great deal.
1083;The bonus features are great, and they did an amazing job remastering the movie.
1084;This often overlooked film is one of a handful of films to have transcended the action genre and be known simply as a great movie.
1085;The plot is simple yet intriguing, the special effects are awesome, and the acting is above par for an action movie.
1086;Predator is suspenseful and exhilirating, its Alien set in the jungle.
1087;not even two minutes in you know you're going to enjoy watching it.
1088;First, the team goes marching into the jungle with all of the bravado in the world.
1089;the first sequence is more entertaining than most.
1090;Blain (Jesse Ventura) is of particular note, as his quips are sharper than most, that, and he carries a mini.
1091;The film is excellent in maintaining its suspense by not showing the Predator at this point.
1092;I won't go into detail about the efforts of Mac (Bill Duke) and Dillon (Carl Weathers) to attack the beast, but it is handled with style and finesse.
1093;the film's denouement is brilliant both in style and substance.
1094;The film's nightime aesthetics are welcome.
1095;Dutch and the Predator move around in the dark, taking shots at one another and playing cat and mouse games.
1096;As they move closer and closer to hand.
1097;I must admit that even for a girl, I think this is one of the best nail.
1098;biting, or fist smashing if you prefer, action movies that has hit the screen in the past years.
1099;This movie came out when I was six years old and along with the Conan movies, which were one of the first movies I have ever seen, made Schwarzenegger my favorite action hero.
1100;predator is one of those movies that have never received a bad word from anyone I know and that is rare these days.
1101;The action and fight sequences were very impressive and the hunt and traps that were set up to catch the hunter were really fun to watch.
1102;Unfortunatelly, against the lush, green backdrop the Predator is deadly, fast, shoots lasers and even turns invisible and proves that he's the master of camouflage
1103;dutch takes the role of the dog catcher and takes us though the wild jungles on the hunt, and I can safely say that this movie never bores.
1104;The ending was spine tingling and intense and provided a satiating finale to this robust movie.
1105;Great action flick whether you like terrestrial boogey men or not.
1106;The transfer was amazingly clean and crisp, although for some reason Carl Weathers seems to glow with a strange kind of magic (perhaps a side effect from pushing too many pencils).
1107;Arnold Schwarzenegger is good at this sci.
1108;Predator is very well done, and nicely directed.
1109;With good acting, a good plot, and kick.
1110;predator is kind of like the ground vesion of Alien, but with a lot more action.
1111;The fight scene were Arnold and his men attacks the village, is very cool.
1112;All in all, it is a cool sci.
1113;made, stylish action film should be.
1114;but this 1987 film is undoubtedly one of the better films of the action genre, one tinged with a sci.
1115;fi angle that provides slight novelty to what is pretty much a gruesome version of Ten Little Indians in a Central American jungle.
1116;McTiernan could show some of the younger hotshot action directors today how to really craft great action.
1117;With both PREDATOR and DIE HARD, he proves that great Hollywood entertainment doesn't have to be simply brainless or crude.
1118;In both those films, McTiernan brings energy, wit, and even an eye for beautifully composed images to considerably liven up a potentially routine action thriller.
1119;PREDATOR definitely benefits from some terrific jungle scenery and cinematography (by Donald McAlpine)
1120;In a way, McTiernan is a more refined action director than most, emphasizing slick craftsmanship over sheer heart.
1121;the special visual and aural effects of this film still look and sound top.
1122;Stan Winston's conception of the alien creature is still dazzling (and grotesque) to look at, and the sound effects are always convincingly atmospheric.
1123;once again he proves himself to be a pretty good action hero, with certainly the physique to be one as well as a decent way with a cheesy one.
1124;The former Mr. Universe had not, by this film, shown the charisma and likable self.
1125;in sum, if you're looking for action fireworks, PREDATOR will fit the bill quite nicely.
1126;Director John McTiernan brings a welcome amount of class to the picture, bringing wit and style and even an acute sense of beautiful imagery to what would be merely a crude gorefest in lesser hands.
1127;paced (apart from a slow beginning), suspenseful, exciting action ride with a final showdown between good and evil that rivals with the best final showdowns of the action genre.
1128;A special army forces team head to the jungle at a rescue mission and defeat one opponent army unit magnificently.
1129;He hunts them one after the other and finally gets to Arnold.
1130;i just love the superiority of the Predator character.
1131;fi creature in the jungle who can blend in with the woods, has heat seeking guns on his shoulders, and hops from tree to tree like a monkey.
1132;His team is just as impressive with a tracker who can sense the danger in the jungle, a tobacco.
1133;if you haven't seen Predator, this collector's edition is definitely the way to go.
1134;I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sction/adventure and sci.
1135;fi movies
1136;i had my nephew come over for the night to watch this movie for the first time ever and he was impressed with the experience.
1137;professional reviewers pointed out DNR heavy use, that didn't bother me much and besides it is a film from 1987 so it is okay with my floating boat.
1138;this film is easily among my top sci.
1139;The seller sent this right on time and it was in excellent shape and of course is the best monster action movie.
1140;with good graphics and sound.
1141;Yes it's stupid, but it's fun.
1142;If, however, you are after special features then I recommend a visit to Amazon.
1143;disc set with special features!)
1144;Arguably the best action flick ever made!
1145;Now there's a rumor that a reboot/remake is in the works.
1146;More than just a commando film, the plot to this film is admirable .
1147;This alien advisary is phenominal and truly frightening.
1148;Even knowing the ending, I was on the edge of my seat to see how Arnold with win against such odds.
1149;hum and the world is without a true action hero to root for (Vin Diesal is NOT Arnold in his prime), this movie is a refreshing reminder of what a great action movie should be.
1150;I was a bit surprised!
1151;Really great job on this one!
1152;Stay away from the new blu.
1153;ray offering at all costs!
1154;One of the big man's best films, with great action, a creepy musical score and Stan Winston's excellent alien.
1155;The action ante is great, and McTiernan's talent for over.
1156;the top action can be seen very clearly here.
1157;This is great brainless entertainment.
1158;If you're happy with grainy, prehistoric images .
1159;ray player because you appreciate High Definition and clarity, this Blu.
1160;it was a good one to see.
1161;Predator can easily be counted among the top action movies of the eighties and can unquestionably be counted among the top Arnold Schwarzenegger movies!
1162;This movie is quite simply, a pure action packed thriller that sets a level of intensity that few movies in the genre can match.
1163;The action coupled with the superior score will definitely leave a first time viewer astonished at what they're watching.
1164;one of the elements of this film that makes it such the powerhouse that it is was the performance given by the testosterone laden cast.
1165;Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is brilliant in the leading role.
1166;The supporting cast is almost legendary for the industry
1167;director John McTiernan did an absolutely perfect job with this movie.
1168;The job that Alan Silvestri did with the music for this movie should've won him an Oscar if it didn't.
1169;Great movie with some classic Arnold.
1170;this movie is my favorite Schwarzenegger flick of all time.
1171;I absolutely love this movie.
1172;And to think I was watching a VHS tape of this great movie all these years!Now I can really watch the movie!
1173;Arnold is amazing, unlike other movies, I can watch it over and over again.
1174;once again Arnold has amazed me!
1175;ray offering is stunning and for fans of the series this is a must have!
1176;The color saturation is rich and clean and the luma level are perfect.
1177;I love the first Predator best of all and it finally got a release deserving of its content!
1178;This is a really cool movie.
1179;Oh, yeah, the alien can blend in with the jungle his in.
1180;My favirite part was the cool fight in the end.
1181;This was a great film.
1182;one of my favorite movies and the transfer is only slightly better than the previous issue.
1183;WHEN are they going to give us a high.
1184;which makes films more immersive in my opinion.
1185;The picture is very clean and clear.
1186;Predator is an awesome action movie in it's purest form.
1187;, military guys with even bigger guns will go into the jungle on a mission.
1188;Silver may just be the greatest thing to happen to the action movie since James Bond leapt from Ian Fleming's page onto the screen in Sean Connery's body.
1189;He must have seen the potential for greatness.
1190;why is Predator so brilliant?
1191;McTiernan, just put the pieces together right.
1192;Alan Silvestri's heart pounding score, the amazing special effects from the predator's camouflage and it's POV, and Arnold, how great is Arnold?
1193;Pretty great (he certainly has some of his best one.
1194;It transcends it's genre, everything about it is tip.
1195;It is definitely one of Arnold's best roles.
1196;Is Predator one of the best action/sci.
1197;This is a great movie.
1198;But I do not agree that this is Arnold's greatest performance ever.
1199;It is one of his best though.
1200;I like the idea for this action adventure sci.
1201;Always considered to be the action hero who saves the day.
1202;But I like the story line of this movie.
1203;Terrific in more way than one.
1204;This is one of if not my favorite movies.
1205;ths is an action filled movie with a hint of sci.
1206;Arnold is at his best in this feature.
1207;So, naturally this BD has it.
1208;it is even more grainier than this film.
1209;There was great deep bass, especially when the minigun was used and + explosions.
1210;I was happy with it.
1211;Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a crack team behind enemy lines.
1212;Super special effects, active story that keeps you on the edge.
1213;5.5 is this film's merit!
1214;The commandos soon discover that the jungle covers a hunter with nearly supernatural abilities, courtesy of a cool high tech suit that renders the hunter nearly invisible.
1215;This very same hunter has agility and strength that even Arnold would envy, and who is physically more than a match for Arnold.
1216;But this movie is not just about Arnold's strength
1217;While this movie may not be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies, it still plays well as an action movie, and provides Arnold with one of his most challenging foes ever.
1218;I love the film, it gets 5 stars.
1219;Take it from me, a previous skeptic, this is a very decent Blu Ray and I imagine this is the best Predator has looked to date.
1220;This has some great action and the acting is good with other co. stars like Jesse Ventura, carl Weathers and a few others.
1221;Ya gotta see this movie if you like action or any type of movieKray.
1222;I've only enjoyed a handful of his movies, with Predator being one of them.
1223;I have a habit of checking out the special features first before diving into the movie, and I was very happy with the number of behind the scenes featurettes in the second disc.
1224;my favorite special feature is the text commentary in the first disc.
1225;This commentary is chock full of great information as well as interviews with the crew.
1226;After all, this is one of the great action flicks of the 20th century!
1227;Great acting, Great special effects, Great story, Great momentum.
1228;My husband really enjoyed the movie.
1229;Still holds up after all these years, Best part is it came in near prefect shape.
1230;If you want to witness the absolute most damning affects that digital noise reduction can bring to a film, give Fox's Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition a spin.
1231;ray and watch any scene in the film.
1232;If you don't want the sequels at all then UHE is good value for your money if you can accept the limitations.
1233;total), each character's personality is developed and the viewer becomes familiar with each of their survival mentalities.
1234;The main character is Dutch, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, in what I consider to be his best movie performance in his career.
1235;and his manner is hardened and strict, he fits the role perfectly.
1236;The other actors in this movie (Weathers, Carrillo, Black, and at the time, future politician Jesse Ventura) all turn in decent performances.
1237;The casting was perfect and resulted in good acting.
1238;two elements that really make this movie great are the soundtrack and the scenery.
1239;The haunting music is fantastic and it's unfortunate that only the soundtrack for Predator 2 is available.
1240;It is a great sci.
1241;fi/thriller film that is guaranteed to be enjoyed by all who see it.
1242;John Mctiernan's The Predator is a pornographic masterpiece for its graphic depiction of gunplay (a lot of gunplay) and violence.
1243;This film is much more than just a Arnold picture in my opinon its his best movie and always will be his best movie its brillent and it may well be the most action pack film ever made its also landmark for its graphic depiction of gunplay and mixing sci.
1244;Arnold Schwarzenegger is very populair in the Netherlands and Predator is a must to see.
1245;The movie is explosive from the start untill the end.
1246;man battle against an alien is great and there are more than 70 reviews for this movie.
1247;Absolutely the best Arnold film made.
1248;great cast of characters with a great action story and non stop mayhem.
1249;Without a doubt, Predator stands as one of my favorite films of the 1980s and perhaps, of all time.
1250;i found a great many similarities in Predator and McTierman's later film, the 13th Warrior, with both films possessing great strengths in both characterization, style and energy.
1251;Both films have in abundance a large cast of characters, all of whom are for the part, very likeable and an air of creepiness as the surreal intrudes on the real.
1252;There is a huge contrast between Predator's cast of commandos and those found in Resident Evil.
1253;The final battle between Dutch and the Predator is finely crafted tour de force as Dutch pits his experience and intelligence against that of a foe equipped with advanced technology and no small amount of its own experience.
1254;All four series have, to one degree or another, an ``expanded universe'' in much the same way that both Star Wars and Star Trek do, albeit much smaller.
1255;There was even a project at 20th Century Fox to make an Aliens.
1256;One of my favorite movies ever.
1257;Easily the better of the two films by star power alone.
1258;Special effects are modern to this day.
1259;One of the best sci.
1260;fi action movies ever made, period.
1261;But that safe zone is miles away through the jungle.
1262;what makes it special is the pristine look that the blu.
1263;but it offers something else as well.
1264;As I said at the start the movie holds up amazingly well.
1265;But this movie, this edition, is well worth the extra expense.
1266;I love the fact that older movies that I love are getting released on Blu Ray.
1267;This movie looks amazing and sounds awesome.
1268;I've seen it around 50 times and I'm sure to see it 50 more!
1269;When I am looking for a digital copy of a film, it's usually beacuse I want a perfect copy.
1270;And as far as I can see Predator lives up to this standard.
1271;While I would have liked to see more information on the disc, the film itself is in excellent condition.
1272;Predator is such a fantastic action sci.
1273;It's a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger movie and it's one of the reasons he is where is today.
1274;the plot to Predator is simple enough to follow.
1275;arnold Schwarzenegger is simply fantastic in this film.
1276;This is one of the best action films he has ever made.
1277;When him and the predator go one on one it's awesome.
1278;Arnold is an absolute beast in the film.
1279;This movie helped make him the household name that he is today.
1280;i liked Carl Weathers in this film.
1281;After seeing him arm wrestle Arnold in the film you really recognize what kind of peak condition this guy was in at one point.
1282;I like Carl Weahters a lot and his role in Predator is great.
1283;the rest of Arnolds team is full of plenty of guys that you see in a lot of his 80's movies.
1284;The squad is casted perfectly as is this movie.
1285;john McTiernan has to get a lot of credit for the success of this movie.
1286;This is a very well made movie.
1287;I love what he did with the Predator in the film.
1288;So like Spielberg did in Jaws you let the suspense of the creature scare you.
1289;McTiernan does that to perfection.
1290;He baits you a little bit by showing you some of the Predator but it's just enough to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.
1291;He also shot his movie beautifully on location in South America.
1292;this really is a well made movie.
1293;It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way until the end.
1294;fi thriller and can be argued as the best of all time.
1295;You can't really call yourself I sci.
1296;To go back and make it so, is nice.
1297;This is one of the most unique science fiction movies I have seen in all my years of reviewing movies.
1298;I loved it so much that here I am, in 2001, reviewing this flick which was made in, I believe, 1987.
1299;The casting was perfect: a tight knit band of soldiers sent on one mission, but who end up running for their lives when some space predator decides to pick them off, one by one.
1300;the jungle serves as the perfect setting for a number of scene switches, from water and mud to forests.
1301;That's how good it is.
1302;racial team of soldiers
1303;Arnold is innovative as he fights the intergalactic scavenger who takes human spines as his trophies.
1304;If you haven't seen this movie, you'll be riveted to your seat.
1305;And the haunting melody of the soundtrack is as exciting as the action on the screen.
1306;The sequel to this movie proves the point that this movie got the setting right in having the alien predator hunt in the forests of earth.
1307;a punchy soundtrack, and taut direction by MacTiernan make this movie a tense piece of action.
1308;This film is full of memorable action and ho.
1309;On the whole it is a well.
1310;I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
1311;i,ve seen this movie 125 times,i practially know the film of by heart, it's got the best speacil effects, even though its thirteen years old its still updated till today.
1312;this film deserves all the awards in the world.
1313;For me this is an Arnie action film at its finest, it does everything right.
1314;it tells the story of a special forces team sent into a central American jungle to rescue some hostages.
1315;There is an excellent camaraderie between the team that really comes across and gives them meaning once things hit the fan.
1316;Layer onto that an excellent alien and you have a great action film.
1317;The predator is a cool opponent, he's tough and smart and has some cool toys.
1318;It also has some of the most quotable lines ever :.)
1319;The final icing on the cake is the music, it works at every moment from the title credits all the way through to the end.
1320;This film was made before the advent of mass CG, but is still a visual treat and I would argue better for it.
1321;For me this isn't just one of Arnie's best films, it's one of the top action films ever made.
1322;PREDATOR was an absolutely fantastic action/adventure sci.
1323;That's about all there is to the story, but it is very well executed and is easily one of Schwarzenegger's and McTiernan's best.
1324;The jungle has more depth and all in all looks great.
1325;Sound is as good as you are going to get with this movie.
1326;I am very happy with this since I basically got it for free after using a promotional credit.
1327;arnold is great in this role.
1328;He doesn't try to act toooo bad, but he does a great job of taking down the baddies.
1329;The Predator could wipe out a city block, and its really cool to see Arnold take him on.
1330;This is an amazing film.
1331;The tension is completely covincing, in fact, this is one of the rare films that had my heart pumping big time.
1332;action thriller films, you become desensatized to the thrill, that's why this film shocked me so much.
1333;It was a pretty cool movie and a good way to kick off the series of all the Predator movies.
1334;This is one of the most sinister killing machines you will ever see in a movie.
1335;The action is nonstop.You will also have to brag on the scenery in this movie as well.
1336;The stars are also top notch.
1337;The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1338;Watch this video,you will be greatly entertained.
1339;If that's your thing you will love it.
1340;This is a great movie, certainly the best of Schwarzenegger's career.
1341;They did a good job with the audio on the new release with the 5.1 DTS, however the video transfer could use a lot of help.
1342;I really enjoyed it from start to finish.
1343;Alien and Aliens are so much better.
1344;I liked the score and cinematography and there is occasionally some decent gore thrown in here and there.
1345;See Die Hard 1 3, Hunt For Red October or Last Action Hero for a good John Mctiernan film.
1346;This movie is a classic that can be watched again and again.
1347;If you enjoy action movies, this one is a must watch!
1348;Arnold in an updated version of Most Dangerous Game against an alien hunter who can be invisible, has a force field, has heat sensors, and super advanced weaponry.
1349;This is one of the most memorable aliens in the history of cinema.
1350;there are some memorable lines, especially what Arnold says to the alien after he sees what he looks like under his body armor.
1351;If you can get by that, you will highly enjoy this film.
1352;When I first saw this movie back in 1987, I was overwhelmed by its originality and felt it was very suspenseful.
1353;One of Arnold's best, for sure.
1354;Of all the movies I have ever seen.
1355;no matter how spectacular the special effects, the acting, the script writing, anything.
1356;this movie is, and always will be, my favorite movie of all time.
1357;Quite possibly Arnold's BEST movie, this movie is non.
1358;A Guerilla camp has taken diplomatic hostages and it is up to Arnold and his team to rescue them.
1359;The entire movie is action.
1360;packed, full of Arnold's trademark grunts and groans.
1361;The special effects are excellent and the environments are incredible.
1362;fi creatures of all time, eventually clashing head to head with THE most popular creature ever, the Alien, in numerous comic book, novel, video game, card game, and action figure incarnations.
1363;Arnold is a great hero and the final battle with the Predator is indeed a memorable one, sporting one of the most famous lines in Sci.
1364;Like Alien before it this film has a seven crew team that is hunted eliminated, Arnold is great here as a leader of highly trained special forces unit, that get caught up in all kinds of mishaps (CIA double.
1365;crossings,unseen stalker) They are constantly watched by this unseen enemy, Jesse Ventura gives a memorable performance, Sonny Landham (48HRS.)
1366;The end shows a broken and bewildered Arnold, who at best just survives.
1367;The music is what puts the movie over the top
1368;1987's PREDATOR is an entertaining and suspenseful hybrid of the sci.
1369;fi, horror, and action genres that came out a few years after his phenomenal success with his roles in THE TERMINATOR and the CONAN THE BARBARIAN movies, and muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger demonstrates here that the range of his acting skills continues to expand.
1370;Considering the film's production date, the breathtaking special FX are very original and innovative, and Stan Winston's design and FX for the alien are so totally cool that the creature remains a popular SF icon today.
1371;flick fan can add it to their collection.
1372;2 discs, the first with the movie (one of the greatest sci.
1373;fi movies ever with a great sound track), the second with tons of extras, including outtakes, featurettes on character design, stunts, special effects, interviews, makeup, location, camouflage tests of the predator and a photo gallery.
1374;A great update to a classic action flick.
1375;This is a classic at my house.
1376;fi classic, and is notable for some of Arnie's most natural acting, the film is let down by that still alive and well curse that plagued US military/action movies during the 80's: massive, unashamed cornball dialogue, 'bad.
1377;type grip purely to compare and showcase their bulging biceps (DILLON.
1378;The most amusing part of the movie was seeing these various turds get sequentially wiped out!
1379;PREDATOR!ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER plays his best role ever as Dutch Schaefer, leader of an elite force, sent to the South American Jungle to rescue hostages held by guerilla fighters.
1380;But along the mission, Dutch soon discovers that there are no guerillas, but his long time best friend, Dylan (Carl Weathers) is only seeking revenge upon the people that skinned his good friend, Jim Hopper, alive!
1381;The explosive awesome force of the Predator is amazing.
1382;This is the best film ever made!
1383;Check this action thriller out right away!
1384;The plot is original (for its time), the action never lets up, and the chills never stop thrilling!
1385;fi extravaganza that rocks the screen!
1386;There is so much to say about this movie because it is so great!
1387;It is my favorite movie and is the best one I have seen to date!
1388;Arnold was a burgeoning action star in the 80's, and the vicious, relentless Predator is one of his best.
1389;the special and visual effects still look stunning today.
1390;They're bloody but still some of the best I have ever seen.
1391;Arnold and the gang are very much in their comfort zones with Mctierien behind the camera.
1392;And to offset the blood and guts, there is some comic relief, mostly provided by Jesse Ventura.
1393;all in all, this an action movie that has been able to survive the 80's with credibility, primarily because of the director.
1394;It is crystal clear, razor sharp and bursting with color.
1395;Scenes in the jungle, scenes at night, scenes inside.
1396;for me, this is amazing.
1397;They believe a movie from the 80s should look like a movie from the 80s and the loss of grain and the new found vibrancy is against the pure film as originally seen.
1398;ray than the previous one.
1399;The depth this subtle effect gives this mostly jungle movie is pretty striking after watching the movie so many times in 2D.
1400;the classic predatos with the last technology !
1401;One of my favorites in the category of Sci.
1402;Story and cinematic are very creative.
1403;He did a fine acting job in predator, but his movies since then, you almost wonder if he ever had any experience acting at all.
1404;You still can enjoy predator to this day.
1405;The most unforgettable scene is when the alien takes his mask off for arnold.
1406;The face looked so real.
1407;And teeth both inside and outside of his mouth.
1408;I also think that the action music added to the intensity.
1409;Like 90 percent of all my favorite movies were made in the 80's, and they were so creative that writers copy the ideas to this day.
1410;This is by far the best alien movie ever.
1411;The fact that his main advantage is he can camoflauge himself like many animals can do in the jungle (changing color when they feel thereatened to blend in with the jungle.)
1412;This will always be one of my favorite movies.
1413;I saw it when i was a kid, and still love it.
1414;It's entertaining, funny, scary, intelligent, intense, and a classic.
1415;It hunts for sport, it has the chameleonic ability to remain unseen, and it's after Schaefer and his men.
1416;It is undoubtedly among the best movies of its genre.
1417;Essentially you're taking a gritty,savage,film and giving (or attempting) it a slick 21st century makeover with mixed results at best.
1418;Lets take a more in depth look.
1419;He's got to be referring to one of the previous releases of Predator, because this baby is full (its a 2.
1420;The movie is most certainly fun, and when i watch it, i don't even realize how long it is.
1421;Great extras that you just have to watch, there's plenty of good feelings from the crew and cast, and you really respect the work that went in to creating the Predator.
1422;Also has a lively commentary track.
1423;what's must I say more, this movie is an instant classic.
1424;Its an awesome movie to watch on a roadtrip.
1425;It is superb, perfectly constructed and created by Stan Winston, much better than the creatures that ever caused a fright in the 'Alien' movies.
1426;maybe its best leaving it like it is, but it would have been nice to have had a trilogy.
1427;Watching the 2 disc collector's edition of Predator I was amazed how well this film has held up!
1428;I think I liked it more now than when I saw it in a theater.
1429;This is a tense good old fashioned Sci.
1430;The FX still look great and this has got to be one of the best creature designs in the last 20 or 30 years!
1431;It's a lot of fun with a great monster and excellent pacing!
1432;Oh man, what an American classic.
1433;This is my favorite movie of all time !!!
1434;I am so happy they decided to redo this masterpiece.
1435;Blue ray makes it even better.
1436;Every 1 who is a fan of Arnold knows he is a legend!
1437;This is a good #throwback
1438;I have always liked this film.
1439;He yells at one of his men and MAKES NO SENSE.
1440;Entertaining from start to finish.
1441;This movie will shoot you full of goosebumps and give you an adrenaline rush like you have never felt before.
1442;fOX made a proper transfer as good as COMMANDO another ARNIE filck from FOX, the jungles are in more detail like you`ve never seen it before, the sweat on the actors, the night and dark scences, the blood dripping from the leaves and trees, the special effects and the action looks so great, see and hear it like never before.
1443;I'd give this one star as a science fiction/action/horror film but two stars as a comedy!
1444;This is in my opinion Arnies best work.
1445;For this, let us give thanks to director McTiernan, who, on his first studio film, takes plot, characters, and visuals to a nice plateau.
1446;The fear and suspense are genuinely felt, and, for once at least, the corny one liners (STEECK around!)
1447;This is a great movie.
1448;The charactors are memorable, especially the predator itself.
1449;The settings, from the military base to the helicopters to the beautiful, lush jungle, are absolutely fantastic.
1450;The special effects are very good, still perfectly good today in the age of CGI.
1451;The action is excellent, the humor slick, and the gore at just the right level.
1452;I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see what is simply an excellent action movie.
1453;Quintessential 80's movie and still one of the best sci fi action movies ever made.
1454;Predator, the film which helped launch the career of director John McTiernan (who would later helm the first Die Hard movie), and the film which introduced us to one of the most terrifying and impressive movie monsters ever in the Predator.
1455;While the movie is great, some more special features would have been nice.
1456;All in all though, if you've never had a chance to see the original Predator, now has never been a better time, its one of the best sci.
1457;Enter Arnold and his elite squad of special forces operators, and Carl Weathers as their unscrupulous CIA agent/manipulator.
1458;It all adds up to a heart warming tale of American ingenuity (vine ropes, tree trunk traps) and good old fashioned mutilation and slaughter.
1459;The great comic book story starring Arnold, what more could you ask for?
1460;The story is inventive and the action is top notch.
1461;For other old timers out there who may have seen the film when it was released in theaters in '87, I wanted to mention that this print is excellent, the transfer to Blu.
1462;One of Arnold's better movies.
1463;A little known fact though, the original predator was actually played by Jean.
1464;The director wanted there between a considerable difference between the predator and Arnold.
1465;This movie is okay, I don't why everybody say this is Arnie's best movie.
1466;This movie is a classic, and I decided to review the premier collection version today.
1467;This is the two disk version with a ton a special features.
1468;the story is pretty cool, basically a group of special ops people going to rescue a VIP and find something surprising instead.
1469;It's a pretty decent story, which has twists and surprises along the journey.
1470;The acting is pretty spot.
1471;The forest is entirely believable, especially with the trouble they had with finding a working jungle.
1472;The rest of the special effects are pretty good for this old of a movie.
1473;the soundtrack is pretty memorable, and every time I hear the theme I think of the predator.
1474;I do believe this has been copied in other movies, and that just adds to the originality of it.
1475;The gun fire, explosion noises, and predator noises are pretty detailed and give personalities to them.
1476;the special features start off with a commentary with the director, and a sneak peak at I Robot and AVP on the first disk.
1477;The second disk includes a multitude of special features which is nice since most movies have little to none, or its really crappy special features.
1478;overall this is a pretty decent film that has a lot of famous lines that came from it, and you can tell that some movies tried to copy from this formula.
1479;I enjoyed watching it again and again !
1480;Predator still holds up as a top notch action film.
1481;This is easily one of Arnold's best movies.
1482;It's pure Arnold 80s action as he and his crew of professional maniacs blast their way through the jungle.
1483;this is a great example of a pure action movie where you're not asked to think about it too long (and it's probably advisable that you don't.)
1484;the size, the strength, the speed, the cloaking, the weaponry, including a shoulder mounted laser guided gun.you wonder why he would come all the way to earth to hunt.
1485;The movie has many recommendation points, but honestly, it's not like you'll pick this one up by accident.
1486;You're in for a fast, bloody, well made and well acted action film that delivers the goods.
1487;The supporting cast is strong as well, including Shane Black (the screenwriter(!))
1488;earth American Indian who is in touch with the alien's moves early on.
1489;highly recommended for action (and Arnold fans).
1490;One of Arnold's best films outside of Conan and Terminator.
1491;Also a great action star line.
1492;joe action figure stereotypes but the script and action sequences make them believable and entertaining.
1493;Even with the mystery of the predator being gone, I still get thrills every time I see this movie: not to mention laughs at the humorous dialogue
1494;I'm gonna have me some fun!
1495;The special effects are still great after all of this time and the music really carries on the suspense.
1496;Altogether one of the greatest sci.
1497;I've watched this movie a hundred times and I stil enjoy it.
1498;The vicious hunter from space slaughters the group one by one, eventually having Arnie as the last living human in the vast jungle of death.
1499;The story is very well paced, and the superb acting, editing, cinematography, and score push it even further.
1500;Regardless, the greatest aspect of the film is undeniably the predator itself.
1501;Neat gadgets (including numerous weapons and a cloaking device) show the surprising intelligence of the creature.
1502;The pure savagery and barbaric appeal it has really puts fear in the viewer!
1503;suit and costume used are extremely realistic, and in the simplest of terms, the predator is the coolest monster ever to appear on screen.
1504;This is a masterpiece in every way.
1505;My husband and I enjoyed the movie very much, the movie arrived on time just as they said it would.
1506;it has it all and the predator is actually menacing, unlike that stupid alien vs predator series.
1507;Love the ending on this one too.
1508;An authentic goodArnold film: violence, but with brains.
1509;It introduced a character (THE PREDATOR) who even went into comic, with success.
1510;Last important appearance, in movies, by the great APOLLO CREED from ROcky.
1511;predator tells a rather simple story: American Special Forces operatives are ordered into the South American jungle to rescue some local government dignitaries.
1512;What follows are a number of spectacular action scenes and just the right amount of dialouge that shows just how scared these guys, the baddest of the bad, are of this thing that's hunting them.
1513;The script is lean and mean, never giving up more than it has to, and the direction by John McTiernen is perfect as well.
1514;The suspense, for an adrenaline fuled action flick, is layed on with the right amount of frightened humor and energing dread as each character begins to realize they're probably not going to make it home.
1515;The predator's sound effects, from the breathing to the lock on target sounds are crisp, and the dialouge never gets overwhelmed by the action.
1516;And when it gets quiet, boy is it quiet.
1517;McTiernan has a good, not great, commentary on the film that talks a bit about the problems getting the film made, which is interesting enough.
1518;His best commentary is on Die Hard, but this one is good.
1519;The text commentary with technical details is fun to have on as well.
1520;disc 2 is a great tribute the whole film, with a new Documentary that gives time to all of the actors, filmmakers, and the writer.
1521;FOX has been putting some terrific collections together since they abandoned the 5.
1522;star collection, and this is one of their finest.
1523;I love the film Predator.
1524;well they succeeded and not in a good way either.
1525;still this is the best the film has ever looked.
1526;I have always loved this movie and looked forward to seeing in Blu.
1527;This movie is iconic for so many reasons.
1528;The one liners were great, the set up is perfect, and the cast is unforgettable!
1529;The updated graphics and sound made this movie brand new all over again.
1530;I enjoyed every minute of watching it again and you will too!
1531;arny'll make it worth your while.
1532;This film looks absolutely wonderful (among the better Blu Ray films I've seen) and Predator and Blu Ray fans who like to feel blown away by films like Avatar will be similarly blown away by this version of the film.
1533;The pros do that fine, and people here are trying to spin on that.
1534;excellent transfer, so all the complainers well, they are the ones missing out.
1535;I am not a big fan of Science Fiction movies but the Predator is fairly entertaining.
1536;fi move to date is T.2, which is a much more well rounded movie than this in my opinion.
1537;Overall if you are a fan of these types of films or one of Schwarzenegger, then think you could enjoy it but for the more casual sci.
1538;fi fan look towards some more recent releases for a more well rounded experience.
1539;Honestly Predator is one of the best movies in existence.
1540;The film is very original, and is one of those movies that has such a strong cult following, that I think a lot of people would hardcore protest if they ever tried to remake THIS movie.
1541;It's simply that good of a movie.
1542;This Movie was made with some of the Best Stunts Ever.
1543;The take on killing off, one at a time is one thriller point, is better than any Then There Were None .
1544;Probably, Schwarzenegger's best ever performance, as well as Bill Duke, Carl Weathers and Sonny Landham at the top of their game.
1545;Like, I say, this movie is sound perfect from a guy with two hearing aids.
1546;I bought this movie without even seeing it.
1547;i houp it is good.
1548;I bought this movie as a part of .
1549;Walmart and exchanged for another pack.
1550;it's kind of a like a harlem globetrotters ensemble of tough guy actors for this movie but it's good that you actually get to spend some time with all of them before the inevitable killing off starts.
1551;it's a good concept as well, human beings as the prey and it really adds a lot to the plot in that for once there is an explanation for why the evil being doesn't just wade right in and murder everybody at the very beginning.
1552;arnie's really good in this movie, almost understated!
1553;in short, a great action movie that has so far stood the test of time.
1554;One of the finest films in science fiction history and nothing is comparable except The Terminator .
1555;The bad guy gets his, the good guy wins and the earth is saved!
1556;The changing of the mission is a theme I like seeing in movies.
1557;facing an unknown enemy by specialists justadds to the film's enjoyable tensions.
1558;The DTS version is great.
1559;Predator, in my opinion is the best action/sci.
1560;It also has infared vision(which looks really cool form the Predator's point of view).
1561;Predator remains as one of my favorite movies of all time.
1562;It's an otherworldly creature deep in the jungle adept at slaughtering our best.
1563;Special effects, dizzying camera work and a sci.
1564;this item received at excellent condition.
1565;and
1566;great movie, great acting, great story.
1567;This movie is so well put together!
1568;The jungle really fits well with the movie and all the characters and the music is awesome.
1569;I recommend seeing if u havent yet.
1570;The sound ofcourse rocks as well!
1571;You be the judge, I highly recommend the upgrade, otherwise!
1572;paced, suspenseful, frightening, dramatic, action.
1573;adventure film that takes the viewer into the South American jungle and makes him feel part of Arnold's team.
1574;This film offers so much that Arnold's other films, with exceptions, do not seem to compare.
1575;An invisible alien preying on anyone who gets in his way.
1576;It's truly up there with the Terminator movies.
1577;Loved it growing up and still do.
1578;I would love new movies to have the same typr of action best predator movie made.
1579;Outside of the Terminator series, Predator is easily Arnold's best action movie.
1580;The price was absolutely right, I'm a huge fan.
1581;This movie is a classic in my circle of movie friends, the amount of quotable lines is priceless, if it bleeds, we can kill it .
1582;Arnold), especially with the extras this version is awesome!
1583;There is a discussion from Arnold of a practical joke he played on Jesse Ventura aka Sgt Blane regarding their arm size that is priceless.
1584;Visual dynamics are the highlight in this movie about an invisible alien hunter stalking soldiers on assignment in the jungle lands of Central America.
1585;mounted swiveling weapon lighting up the night all combine for a stunning novel viewing experience.
1586;Stan Winston and his staff also did a great job in creating the ferocious alien form.
1587;Lots of fun to be had.
1588;In my opinion, The UHE is the superior disk in terms of color accuracy and detail.
1589;The filmmaker's were consulted, which we always do while they are alive.
1590;If you want to enjoy the movie as the director and cinematographer intended, your choice is the Ultimate Hunter Edition.
1591;I thought it might be interesting to some of you to read some technical details about the difficulty with the source used for the BD and the issue of director's intent:Perhaps this will put to rest any uncertainty about the director's intent regarding grain/grittiness.
1592;ups involving wide clearances which had more natural light and as well, could be more easily illuminated with artificial light, when justified.
1593;ray version represents what the filmmaker wanted it to look like.
1594;This movie was the first and best Predator.
1595;I made it a requirement to watch for the kids wihen they hit the 15.16 year old range.
1596;I know the effects are simple compared to all the CGE now.
1597;I'm a huge fan of Predator and have had this in just about every medium it's been created in.
1598;So I was very happy to see what they included on this disc.
1599;Great extras and great movie make for an all.
1600;around great disc for the sci.
1601;fi, action, popcorn, Arnold movie lover.
1602;This is a decent transfer with lots of good extras.
1603;I've always liked this movie.
1604;this movie plays very, very well on my projector.
1605;i brought friends over and they loved it at least as much as me.
1606;You've read the other reviews, so you get the picture by now.
1607;It's an excellent, imaginitive, and generally well made film.
1608;This first PREDATOR movie is a classic!!
1609;I saw this movie more than 20 times, and still the great story captives my attention.
1610;Crystal clear picture as far as I was concerned.
1611;just a real world setup.
1612;For the rest of you, keep in mind at one point, you all swore that LASERDISC was the end all and be all of home theatre.
1613;Now that I've seen it a second time, I can honestly say it's one of my favorite alien films, period.
1614;This is not supposed to be a beautiful movie (aesthetically), but it was beautiful to me in a visceral sense.
1615;The third, and final, act is a strategic cat and mouse game that ends in sheer excitement, and wonderful fireworks.
1616;The action is in top form.
1617;For a film over a decade old, it still holds up pretty well against today's sorry excuses for action movies.
1618;I loved how they had one man to track (either ironically, or stereotypically, it was a Native American), one man with a mean monster.
1619;sized Gatling gun, and the leader who was actually fit to lead.
1620;Arnold Schwarzenegger actually impressed me with his acting abilities, albeit slightly.
1621;That is the first, and last time I will ever say that.
1622;He and his supporting cast were believable in their roles, but their cliche characters weren't difficult roles to play anyway.
1623;The future Apollo Creed, Carl Weathers did a noteworthy job, as well as my favorite performance, Bill Duke as Mac.
1624;I should also say that they have two of the best death scenes in the film.
1625;I also enjoyed the music a lot.
1626;The story is pretty familiar ground as far as narrative goes, but I'll give it credit for being over twenty years old.
1627;It certainly has inspired many films, and has left us with a few very memorable moments and quotes.
1628;That line was just hilarious to me.
1629;The action, the humor, the suspense.
1630;There's much to enjoy about this movie.
1631;still a great flick though.
1632;I just bought mine today and watched it what a good upgrade.
1633;This is one of the coolest movies of all time in my opinion.
1634;Great suspense and great action.
1635;Arnold is great in this flick.
1636;The jungle scenes are detailed and crisp.
1637;hey and I got a $10 movie money voucher good towards Predators as well.
1638;Sounds fine on a TV, but I bet it would be killer on a 5.1 system.
1639;If you are a collector, then this is the best way to complete one project.
1640;This movie is a classic.
1641;Perfectly crafted, paced and insanely tense.
1642;fi thriller of the highest caliber.
1643;It has and will age very well.
1644;Movie critics of the future will put this on their lists of best movies of all time.
1645;It is nice to see this movie in high definition.
1646;fi movie with solid performances throughout.
1647;Even after 17 years, I still enjoy this hybrid film which combines the best features of action adventure with special effects which create what is generally referred to as science fiction.
1648;It is merely a contrivance to support truly outstanding special effects.
1649;Credit director John McTiernan and his crew with creating a highly entertaining cinematic experience.
1650;i am a huge fan of this movie one day i was walking through wal.
1651;ups (the details in the skin look great).
1652;All the fuzzies, dots, lines, and blemishes on this print look ever better in hi.
1653;One of my favorite Arnold movies.
1654;This new ultimate hunter edition is hands down the best version of a classis film to date.
1655;I bought the movie for 15.00 at Walmart and got a 10.00 movie cash to see Predators.
1656;Hotly recommended for all the fans
1657;An alien has landed on earth.
1658;If you like science fiction, action, movies, this is a good one to see.
1659;Great actors in a good setting with a very bad alien.
1660;Plenty of interesting action with the predator element simultaneously increasing .
1661;Excellent introduction and timing of the predator's role, creating a cliff.
1662;A bit over the top in the preliminary action sequences .
1663;but enjoyable for action junkies none.
1664;In many ways this first movie is better than the sequel, especially with its timing and adequate realism (for an action film) and should prove very worthy before seeing the sequel, and is certainly a worthwhile action movie on its own.
1665;When 'Predator' first came out, it was a well.
1666;But I will review the blu.
1667;ray release retains the original film grain from 1987 and that's a good thing.
1668;Sound is real nice if not front heavy.
1669;This film is highly entertaining and suspenseful, with excellent cinematography and score.
1670;Arnold Schwartznegger is perfectly cast as the hero, and despite his limited acting range, he delivers a faultless performance, as he does in the Terminator trilogy.
1671;For me, as in any film I really enjoy, it is the music which makes this a 5 star production.
1672;Alan Silvestre, also responsible for the Back To The Future trilogy score provides an exceptional score that enhances the movie to a substancial degree.
1673;The strong orchestral rhythmic stabs and crescendos have you on the edge of your seat with the clues that danger is lurking round every corner.
1674;A classic film which does not stand the test of time.
1675;Inventive Stan Winston special effects are worth a watch, and Arnold's lines are fun to remember, though he is out.
1676;acted here by some pretty monotone performances.
1677;Apollo Creed stands out with the most nuanced portrayal in the film
1678;Predator is a classic sci.
1679;fi action film, and fans have been waiting for a proper release of this film on Blu.
1680;DNR can be used to a positive effect (see the recent remaster of the Alien films for example), but studios are overdoing it.
1681;rays of American Psycho, Tremors, Walking Tall, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
1682;Still as good as I remember it.
1683;thought it would seem old, but it was a timeless classic.
1684;I'm glad I bought it.
1685;Much worth the 9.99 to be able to watch it whenever I want (except for on my Android devices. )
1686;This is simply a superb sci.
1687;Directed at a cracking pace by John Mctiernan the film begins with a first rate screenplay.
1688;Arnold Schwarzenegger is the larger than life hero and absolutely in control.
1689;The character portrayed by him is a cool,icy commando respected by his team though mercenarylike.
1690;A truly memorable film though not for the slightly squeamish.
1691;A must see Arnold special.
1692;This move arrived the next day and it was great to play in the background while you have friends over.
1693;I can quote this moving all day long.
1694;I highly recommend this one with Die Hard and the Expendables.
1695;I've always considered it to be a pretty good and entertaining action film.
1696;There's plenty of action throughout, and the special effects are cool.
1697;I also find the acting from the entire cast to be solid and enjoyable.
1698;Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job in his role.
1699;The plot of the movie is satisfying, the being from outer space is fascinating, and the music is also good.
1700;Predator is worth a watch.
1701;Now this is one of those movies that makes you say about movies today they don't make them like they used to.
1702;Every part of this movie is classic.
1703;All the characters, all the lines, all the scenes, the action, the gore, the craziness, the thrills and suspense, 100% classic.
1704;tThis movie is awesome in its own right.
1705;It's a great movie and for the price it's a good deal.
1706;One of the best all time horror pictures.
1707;The monster is a work of art and completly believable.
1708;No computer tricks in this film
1709;great Movie and excellent story
1710;Dutch has a sense of honor that Arnold plays well in all his action films.
1711;He is resourceful and demands a high military standard.
1712;Hell!The battle scenes when they ambush a bunch of South American militants is right out of a Rambo movie, except smartly played.
1713;Hunted by a being from space who has a code of honor as strong and as vicious as Dutch's.
1714;Who will win?The Predator is a cool creature .
1715;Exciting action/adventure film, some gore and very little sympathy.
1716;This movie has a GREAT plot and superb action sequences.
1717;This has to be one of Schwarzenegger's best movies.
1718;I recommend this movie to si.
1719;I love PREDATOR, and I've seen the film countless times on various formats.
1720;Scientifically, it is photon (light) charged particles of silver halides, but visually, film grain creates that subconsciously pleasing visual feel that you get from watching it, the way that you can tell, even on TV, that you are watching a film.
1721;fast forward to 2010, and now, with Robert Rodriguez's new film, PREDATORS out in a few days, 20th Century Fox has released this new version, on a dual.
1722;ray Disc and packed full of extra features.
1723;The muscles of the actors look like globs of ice cream melted together, somehow managing to stay solid.
1724;It might not be perfect, but it is a better presentation of the film than this new 2010 release, and it is therefore the best version of PREDATOR available for home viewing.
1725;Hopefully, Fox will feel the fan backlash and release a properly mastered Blu.
1726;The picture and sound are great, the edges of characters is crisp and clean.
1727;After 25 years later, Predator remains to be one great sci.
1728;horror adventure that has the power to entertain and surprise viewers even today.
1729;predator's success comes from many elements: Just like Alien, the viewer doesn't get to see The Predator which adds suspense and mystery.
1730;It has special weapons that allows himself to kill from a distance but it also likes to slay its victims at close range.
1731;I think one of the reasons for the suspense is the fact that Predator is against the special forces, a fine group of individuals who are trained to kill the enemy in combat.
1732;the visual effects are pretty impressive even at today's standards.
1733;The predator's apparition is nicely done and as well as his actual appearance.
1734;fi horror movie, the score is great and sets the tone of each scene perfectly.
1735;ultimate Hunter Edition Blu Ray is awesome.
1736;predator: Evolution of a Species: Hunters of Extreme Perfection (11 minutes documentary).
1737;predator Profile (this is a cool section depicting and explaining predator's weapons and anatomy).
1738;This is a awesome film that introduced the Predator,a alien hunter with the most advanced technology,into the world of cinema forever.
1739;the acting is great,the action is amazing,and the Predator is one of the greatest movie villians of all time.
1740;And the background for the movie is also a messup.
1741;There are more, believe me.
1742;Good action have always loved this movie.
1743;It was fan tas tic lov lov love it so k that all
1744;This movie looks brand new.
1745;this is how how you do it!!!
1746;It looks great, wonderful depth of field.
1747;It really is an amazing restoration and I really hope they give this treatment to many more of my 80's favorites.
1748;Excellent movie, great cast, and a fantastic alien.
1749;Basically this is a strong, vs the stronger, who will win?
1750;We, Sid the Elf, wanted a real nice B to kick the weekend off perfectly, so we picked up Predator.
1751;Predator was a perfectly done action flick.
1752;Arnold and the team, with the help of the sweetest gun in action movie history, figure out how to track Predator.
1753;After twenty years this is still one of the quintessential action movies.
1754;Better than it's sequel and far, far superior to AVP.
1755;I place it right next to Aliens as one of the best sci.
1756;With few exceptions the FX are on par with those seen in today's films.
1757;The casting is nearly flawless, I not talking about great actors here, what I mean is they are perfectly cast in these roles.
1758;Even thought Arnold wins in the end it costs him his entire team to achieve victory, if you can call it that.
1759;this is definately one of Arnolds best films , in my opinion only behind T2.
1760;The Fx is still great, the action scenes are extremely visceral and the the dialogue is classic .
1761;I'm gonna have me some fun!
1762;I was throughly impressed with this film.
1763;The cast nad their acting, the special effects, and the story were all very memorable.
1764;This is a science fiction movie brought to reality, and theterror you feel while you watch it is very real.
1765;Predator is one of the best Schwarzenegger movie ever made , an also the best in the series .
1766;Alan Dutch Schaefer(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is a major in the United States Army,with a successful and respected career behind him.
1767;An alien predator(portrayed by the late actor Kevin Peter Hall.
1768;fetched,but the script has an edge of darkness that saves it from that.
1769;Predator delivers richly executed suspense from top to bottom,with a beauty that few other films have.
1770;The action is entertaining and goes along well with the plot,while it succeeds in not being violent just for the sake of violence.
1771;All of that,alongside good chemistry between the characters in Predator brought to life by good acting,as well as astounding special and visual effects,allow Predator to fully come together,and be the good film that it is.
1772;if you like action films and have time to watch a film,give Predator a try.
1773;I can honestly say I thought it looked terrific.
1774;While the movie itself is a pretty good action sci.
1775;Still it's likely the best looking transfer you will ever see for Predator.
1776;Amazon is saying all you get is English 5.1 DTS.
1777;Give me over the top 80s action anytime.
1778;From start to finish this is just a great movie, with fantasic action, great verbal sparring and one.
1779;liners, and terrific direction from one of the greatest action directors, John McTiernan (what a one.
1780;chomping to keep you laughing throughout.
1781;I remembered it being a long scene, but in the cinema yesterday everybody was in shock with exactly how long it actually was, and there was laughter and cheering throughout.
1782;Just a totally crazy scene of Arnie and crew destroying the rain forest and I loved it!
1783;Alan Silvestri music is excellent throughout and really helps build the atmostphere and tension.
1784;Arnie, you were one of the greatest and I, for one, miss you.
1785;This is one of the greatest action films that came out of the 1980s, when the genre was at its height.
1786;The predator is one of the best Hollywood monsters ever created.
1787;This is the first review I will have ever written that begins with the extras.
1788;My lord, there sure are a great deal of them and they are all really some of the best you can find.
1789;Oddly, Arnold didn't interview but is seen in several of the other extras, short takes with the writers and directors that actually were interesting and gave you real insight into the production.
1790;All of it was very pertinent and valuable.
1791;The special effects simply enhanced the story.
1792;It had you involved with each character, including the predator, on a basic and emotional level.
1793;It really was an ensemble movie and not just about Arnold and that made a big difference.
1794;There was considerable use of the front left and right channels as, of course, the center channel.
1795;The helicopters certainly made use of the entire 5.1 system and the sub got a good workout with the many explosions throughout.
1796;Most of the rest of the video transfer was fairly decent.
1797;While not the best video transfer, it is still a great movie and the extras were all outstanding.
1798;The price is right, and while not perfect, worth having in your blu ray library.
1799;There were a few short minor scenes where the picture looked grainy and I found very easy to pick up.
1800;this is my favorite Arnold flick.
1801;fi adventure as a special forces extraction unit.
1802;This is the best movie of Arnold I have ever seen.
1803;i enjoyed this movie a lot.
1804;Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 hit film ventures into the Alien territory adding his macho image created by 1985 film Commando.
1805;After the initial mission has done well, another mysterious task looms to the special task force led by Dutch played by Swarzenegger.
1806;it is so so enjoyable movie with high tension satisfying both the action movie fans and monster sci.
1807;verdict: Enjoyable movie and a nice start for longlasting series.
1808;acted, suspenseful, cleverly produced thriller from beginning to end.
1809;The jungle setting is beautifully photographed, and the alien creature attacking Dutch's team is terrifying.
1810;here you will see Arnold in top form.
1811;You see him as a real action hero (super tough soldier) in this movie.
1812;One of the movies to remember Arnold by.
1813;I read all the reviews for the BR but I still love the movie.
1814;The extras are great to watch.
1815;this is a great movie.
1816;I have seen it many times and still like it plenty of action to keep you in your seatI have #2 also
1817;I don't own the older one but the Ultimate Hunter copy looks very good for such an old film.
1818;side note that's kind of funny, in the credits it looks like they are holding them up with plastic wrap or something and filming the floating letters.
1819;Arnold plays the good guy with brains and brawn and a foreign woman to boss around.
1820;It has cool gadgets too, and disgusting ways of skinning people and drying them in trees.
1821;bleeding alien with an oddly human laugh.
1822;If you're looking for a good action movie full of big explosions and hilarious facial expressions, look no further.
1823;Alright maybe not, it isnt star wars, but nonetheless, predator was one of my favorite movies along with Aliens.
1824;The picture actually pops with trees and jungle leaves showing lots of detail.
1825;I have attached 2 pictures so you can see how good it looks on my display.
1826;ray format I'll explain that a bit throughout this review.
1827;I bought this movie on Blu.
1828;ray raises the scale of the video your watching and with the bigger scale the the grain also gets bigger.
1829;That's a very costly and time consuming process that is reserved much more popular films.
1830;This is a great looking version of Predator the colors are as vibrant as they've ever been and I've owned this film in virtually every format since the late 80s.
1831;The best bits of the original special features are included.
1832;the film it's self is 80's sci.
1833;It's really one of Schwarzenegger's best performances in that he actually appears to be threatened for once.
1834;This film also features a great score, a wonderful premise, and an involving cast of supporting characters who all have great moments throughout the course of the film.
1835;ray and quite frankly it looks great especially for an older movie, classic Schwarzenegger movieand looks great, gotta love it.
1836;Love the initial premise, and it is carried off to very good effect by the entire cast of characters.
1837;Moves along quickly and holds you interest throughout.
1838;Coming along for the ride is Dillon, played by Carl Weathers, who used to work with Dutch in years past but now is a CIA agent.
1839;, Sonny Landham as Billy, the Indian Tracker, and the beautiful Elpidia Carillo as Anna.
1840;Each character has a well defined personality that makes each one stand out.
1841;as Dutch calls him, and it can best be described as tall creature with a crab.
1842;I also thought the scene when they were all firing into the jungle to be a bit excessive, but Predator is still a classic for me.
1843;They sure cleaned up the grain from this classic.
1844;The second star is just because it's one of my favorite films of all time.
1845;I gave it 3 stars because its still a very good movie.
1846;He is the lone survivor and masters some elegant barbecue skills.
1847;Arnold Schwarzenegger is once again a brilliant lord.
1848;The action is top notch and made me wonder if they are aliens living among us.
1849;The director of Predator, John McTiernan, made the film, his second, shortly before his creative and economic peak.
1850;and he is furious with Dillon.You'll notice that I have yet to mention the predator, and that's because up until this point in the film he has made little more than small cameo appearances.
1851;o. vision as the alien studies his prey and records some of their conversations.
1852;In fact, the screenplay has a bit of a dual personality.
1853;Like the films Jaws and Alien, McTiernan is smart enough to leave the big reveal until about halfway through the film (and even then the predator is still wearing a mask so we don't get to see his face until the final moments of the movie).
1854;Dutch uses this tactical knowledge in order to even the odds for the final confrontation.
1855;when so many modern blockbusters are trying to be novels, stretching their running time long beyond the 120 minute mark, there is something refreshing when a film like Predator aims to be the perfect short story.
1856;But McTiernan realizes that these conflicts are more important for the tension they create rather than their resolution.
1857;the condensed nature of the film extends to the cast of characters as well.
1858;The filmmakers use the Huey copter ride to give us all the information we need on who these mercenaries are, and, with the precision and grace of a silent kill, they do so with nothing more than a few lines of dialogue.
1859;While this gag relies on easy stereotypes (yes, Billy is also an excellent tracker), it also creates a sense of camaraderie between the soldiers.
1860;Like most of the relations in this film, and in the best short stories, whole histories are implied but not fully illuminated.
1861;but the heart of the film is really the predator.
1862;Hall manages to infuse the predator with a lot of personality, a difficult task when you are hidden underneath a heavy suit.
1863;His movements are simultaneously graceful and unearthly, avoiding the usual clumsiness that accompanies a performance underneath a monster suit.
1864;engaging and, at worst, laughable.
1865;He plans and he also has a code of ethics (he won't kill those who are incapable of defending themselves).
1866;Like the performance by Hall, Stan Winston's design manages to be both otherworldly and grounded in terrestrial cultures.
1867;The most striking aspects to the predator are his dreadlocked hair and reptilian skin.
1868;Not only is this an unusual combination, but it makes a kind of dream sense.
1869;Everyone shoots from the hip, talking and telling jokes on patrol.
1870;Lots of action and some of the greatest one liners ever.
1871;Its always been my favorite movie.
1872;ray I have come across so far.
1873;Yea this is one of arnolds good 1s!
1874;Not his best but good it stays interesting unlike some of his films.
1875;My favorite 1 of his is still True Lies, but this is one of his good ones!
1876;I can see why a lota people enjoy it.
1877;This is probably my favorite, over.
1878;It has likable characters, memorably cheesy quotes (i. e., I ain't got time to bleed), and a high body count.
1879;This movie is alot of fun.
1880;The action is intense and well.
1881;one of my favorite scenes is when the Predator comes out of the water after chasing Arnold.
1882;And human beings are the new species he has discovered.
1883;Predator is the classic action movie.
1884;The ultimate in survival horror movies.
1885;The same team that brought us the first die hard movie brings us this masterpiece of a movie.
1886;This is a must see for anyone that wants to be thrilled and chilled.
1887;Excellent classic movie that inspired an entire genre.
1888;Not really traditional horror, more just scifi action, with a great cast.
1889;This is one of my favorite movies and it's never looked better!I'm guessing by the earlier negative reviews that there is another badly done blue ray out there.
1890;at least they did it right the second time around.
1891;Lots of action and testosterone.
1892;classic Arnold Style action movie.
1893;Jesse Ventura is good in this as well.
1894;If you are looking for a 'fine film' this isn't for you, but if you are looking to lose yourself in a gory, bullet ridden testosterone fest you have come the the right place.
1895;This is an entertaining film with a high level of replayability.
1896;It is well worth the price because you will watch it again and again.
1897;so that tells you how good this damn movie is.
1898;This flick answers the question very well.
1899;While on a minimalist approach, it reflects the endless struggle between technology and morality.
1900;In the alien's eyes, we are merely animals.
1901;The color and lighting of this new transfer are very nicely done .
1902;This is still the best video presentation this film has ever received.
1903;Either way, enjoy this great movie.
1904;I've watched The Predator at least a half dozen times now and it still holds up after all this time.
1905;Arnie is at his Arnie best here.
1906;No
1907;The intense action and suspense still works.
1908;Predator is the excellent movie from 1987, great storyline and plot in the film with action/adventure in the effects style of the film.
1909;Good directing, score, acting, perfect!
1910;It would have been off the f_____g charts if they'd managed to have Arnold and Jesse in for a commentary, but John McTiernan is good enough with a solid track full of details that I really enjoyed listening to.
1911;As far as the film itself, I swoon every time Ol'Painless has screen time, and the dialogue between all the cast is tight and fun chew over again and again.
1912;Tension throughout is amped and executed perfectly.
1913;Even though the graffics are pretty cheesy now this movie is still an action movie worth watching.
1914;Also the movie is packed with extas which will be enjoyed by any fan of the the original movie, Schwarzenegger at his best!!!
1915;there are ZERO extra features on this thing except for the movie trailer.
1916;The movie was in perfect shape.
1917;This is a fantastic, classic sci.
1918;another great Schwarzenegger movie, (but then again, ANY movie he stars in is a hit!!
1919;The Good:First things first: Everything that pertains to 'the Predator' the creature, is FIVE star stuff.
1920;The look, the concept, the sounds, the.
1921;One of the most believeable 'Aliens' created, trust me, being a Trekker, I've seen it all.
1922;But the Predator is truly a frightening beast that has a lean towards fair play at the same time.
1923;It looks horrifically terrific and is a true menace.
1924;The last 30 minutes of this movie are quite good, but in true action form even here everything needs to be 'explained' to the viewer.
1925;up:There is such a delicious race beating underneath the armor.
1926;This movie is a classic, from every perspective.
1927;It is action packed with amazing special effects and much more.
1928;i love my predator blu.
1929;Stan Winston is a genius.
1930;Every one should see this movie.
1931;no bashing here,this film demanded a physical presence who better than one of worlds most developed men!
1932;what the heck it was fun!
1933;i liked it at the time, well again do what you will, senseless violence is a sweet franchise laters folks.
1934;As for me I find this to be a classic movie.
1935;His portrayal of the monster was excellent with many nuances.
1936;Watch the hand movements, head movement.
1937;Arnold is good in this as well.
1938;Lots of physical action for him.
1939;I'm reviewing the blu ray more than the movie
1940;I loved it when I first saw it and I love it now.
1941;Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers work good together as actors, and face it theres Jesse Ventura!
1942;Good action and special effects are done tastefully.
1943;this movie has earned every one of its stars.
1944;It's got lots of big guns, it's got sweat, it's got muscles, it's got classic dialogue (I ain't got time to bleed, if it bleeds, we can kill it), it's got war, it's got jungle, it's got science.
1945;I'd watch this again, over and over and over, and I highly recommend it.
1946;Good acting, great action, and downright claustrophobic suspense keep the plot buzzing right along.
1947;i really don't know, it's so easy to get swept up in it.
1948;The film starts as a buddy flick, turns into Commando and then segues neatly into Alien without any loss of purpose or momentum.
1949;In addition to the innumerable classic one.
1950;Mac (played by Bill Duke) does a wonderful turn as the mournful buddy of Jesse The Governor Ventura, madly murmuring to himself as he chases the Predator into the jungle the same lyrics to the rock music that so triumphantly accompanies them into the jungle in the first place.
1951;Carl Weathers does a good job as a CIA man of mixed loyalties, and of course Arnold is perfectly cast as Dutch, the team leader.
1952;ray completely ruins the gritty rawness of the original film.
1953;I saw this movie (the original Predator) in the movie theaters several times back when it first came out, and I have to say, it had a really gritty and raw look to it that gave it it's whole mood, and it is one of the things that made it such a great movie.
1954;ray version is horrendous, and it totally takes all of the gritty raw atmosphere out of the movie and presents it as polished, plastic, waxy, sterile throughout and completely robs the film of all of its atmosphere and personality.
1955;What a fun movie if you like scary movies.
1956;For some reason this movie really catches my attention each time I watch it.
1957;I'm an Arnold fan though.
1958;I am very happy with how fast this came in the mail.
1959;wow this is one of the best action movies ever so on blu ray it seemed like a no brainer.
1960;This is the BEST movie I have ever see in my life.
1961;The movie is so real.
1962;The plot is terrific, absolutely unpredictable and does not have any hole.
1963;It always keeps me on the edge of my chair.
1964;If you have never see it before, you must to see it.
