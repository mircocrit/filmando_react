1;"town misfit who is released from an asylum and trying to fit in again, then Sling Blade is a ""must see"" movie."
2;"Thornton receives an ""Academy Award winner for Best Adapted Screen Play and for Best Actor in 1996"" in this breath taking performance as Karl Childers."
3;"Now 25 years later he returns to the community where he stumbles upon a young boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) who has lost his father and likes to listen to Karl's rasp voice and his ""all right then"" phrases that he makes."
4;With both Karl and Frank feeling like outcast they are drawn together and become good friends, and before long Karl moves in with Frank and his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), and finds a job fixing lawnmowers.
5;"This is one of my favorite movies
6;It proves that realistic characters and skillful writing can carry a movie.
7;This movie has true emotion and passion, in forms we rarely see from the typical Hollywood fodder.
8;If the frontal lobes of your brain are functional, you will enjoy this movie.
9;I think of myself as something of a movie connoisseur, and this is one of my favorites.
10;It is such an interesting insight into the human mind, the grey area between what's right and wrong, and how we treat and judge one another.
11;Billy Bob Thornton proves his brilliance in so many ways through this film.
12;Sling Blade is a pretty shocking and intense film.
13;John Ritter also stars and he's quite good as well, very under.
14;Gotta see this one, enjoy!
15;It's a must see!The wholeFamily enjoyed it.
16;well written, well rounded filmIf you haven't seen it yet your missing out
17;Biscuits and mustard, French fries taters, and funny, not ha ha.
18;Watched with a small group of friends on New Year's Eve and totally forgot to look at the clock .
19;I have seen this movie a number of times and I am always impressed with Billy Bob Thortons performance.
20;I always found this to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie.
21;I think it is well.
22;the film starts of extremely strong with one of the most disturbing yet most engaging line readings I have ever seen, as we meet Karl for the first time while he's listening to Charles Bushman, a fellow mental institution inmate, reciting one of his lurid tales.
23;J. t. Walsh, the actor who plays Bushman, is so convincing that he literally gave me chills.
24;hands down one of the best cameo performances by an actor in recent memory.
25;He is released into society, back to his home town, amongst people that don't understand him or accept him.
26;Frank and Karl instantly bond, and Frank's mother Linda is grateful, offering her garage to Karl and welcoming him into her life.
27;i am intrigued by the films approach to the subject of love and loyalty, because when the film shakes down to the last few frames it is really all about the sacrifices we make in order to protect the ones we love"
28;He's unrecognizable in sight and sound, yet I never really saw a real transformation.
29;The pacing, the direction, the mood and even the score and soundtrack (which at first was a little off putting) ultimately proves itself strong and engaging.
30;The balance of the performances are also strong.
31;Lucas Black is wonderful as Frank.
32;He beautifully balances his feelings of calm around Karl and then repressed and anxious around Doyle.
33;Thornton does a masterful job directing and writing here, and his success in these two areas help make up for his inability to connect as an actor.
34;Sling Blade is an emotionally exhausting picture which establishes Billy Bob Thornton as one of our very best actors, writers, and directors.
35;"the tragedy of ""Sling Blade"" is that Childers is a basically gentle soul whose abusive childhood ."
36;The result is one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen in a movie.
37;Get those wheels upstairs turning and start enjoying intelligent filmmaking instead of merely seeking an excitement fix!
38;Billy Bob Thornton shows that he is an accomplished actor in this fantastic movie.
39;The story line was easy to follow.
40;This is one of those sloooow moving films that would be twice as good if it was half as long.
41;It's an interesting story and the actors do a good job, but the setting .
42;Karl and Frank strike up a rather strange friendship, because Frank is probably smarter than Karl, and certainly more knowledgeable.
43;karl's doctor asked a friend of his to hire Karl to work on machinery, which Karl did at the hospital and had a natural talent.
44;my whole family really enjoyed it.
45;What I would like to share is how impressed I was with the way the story is told, and the outstanding portrayal of the two main characters.
46;Billy Bob Thornton did an outstanding job directing and acting, and was deserving of an Oscar in portraying Karl so believably.
47;Those who prefer exploding cars, lots of gunfire and special effects may want to pass on this, but if you like depth and look at films as art, you will love it!
48;I consider the storytelling right up there with the very best of them including Forest Gump, Castaway, Gran Turino or anything else.
49;It's extremely compelling and nothing about the pacing or storyline drags or feels awkwardly out of place or anything of that nature.
50;He's most certainly NOT one of my favorite actors, and I had no idea he had the talent to pull off such a believable character, but.
51;If this was his one shining moment of glory, well, it was a darn good one.
52;the storyline is told brilliantly.
53;some will complain that it doesn't make sense for an unstable man with such a violent history being released into society, and well, I can't blame people for thinking this way.
54;There seems to be a strong moral to the story that you should respect others and try your hardest to get along with them the best you can despite not being able to understand them in the slightest, or agree with their ways.
55;i got a lot out of Sling Blade, and I believe you will as well.
56;it flows wonderfully while being extremely easy to grasp.
57;He has great respect for decent people and a powerful need to see justice in action.
58;This event caused Karl to be moved into a mental institution.
59;Twenty five years later, he is found harmless to society and is released.
60;He wanders about and comes across Frank (Lucas Black), a young boy who likes the unique sound of Karl's voice.
61;Karl's strong need to see justice done for decent people competes with his need to avoid what got him into a mental institution many years ago.
62;This movie is a real corker.
63;There is much to laugh at and cheer about.
64;I liked the original theatrical release enormously.
65;Having said that, the other bonus features included in this two disc set are excellent with lots of interviews and in depth behind the scenes.
66;Billy Bob is a very fine actor, one of the most memorable characters in Carl Childers
67;But, at the end you will see who is the retarded ones.
68;I love this movie and watch it time and time again.
69;The actors are great and the plot is even better.
70;This movie won the Academy Award for best screenplay, and it's very easy to see why it was deserving of the acclaim that it received.
71;He's a convicted murderer who killed his own mother and her lover, but the audience is made to love him from the beginning and feel sympathy for his situation.
72;He befriends a young boy named Frank who is being raised by a single mother who has an abusive boyfriend.
73;The movie centers around the growing friendship between Carl and Frank, and how Carl decides to take matters into his own hands in order to protect Frank and his mother from the abusive boyfriend.
74;the strength of this movie is in the acting job by Thornton.
75;While the audience is suspicious of Carl at the beginning of the movie because of his history, we are quickly assured that he is extremely gentle and kind.
76;You'll really hate his character, which obviously means that Yoakam did a great acting job.
77;overall, this is an excellent movie.
78;I would say the overall performance of the supporting actors is poor, but I think this adds local flavor to the movie which makes it more enjoyable to watch.
79;It is simple, as Carl is simple.
80;This is a fantastic movie.
81;I love Billy Bob in this movie.
82;He is a great actor.
83;The best part of Sling Blade is in the first fifteen minutes, which introduce us to Billy Bob Thorton's memorable lead character.
84;He starts to speak and.
85;that voice!The rest of the movie is more conventional, but still quite good as it follows Carl upon his release from the asylum.
86;The movie features uniformly excellent performances, including a tour de force from Dwight Yoakum playing an abusive good ol' boy.
87;Overall, this is a memorable film that will stay with you long after the closing credits roll.
88;"This understated masterpiece features a former bit player named Billy Bob Thornton, who had knocked around show biz for a few years in films like ""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown."""
89;john Ritter also earns respect for his performance as a gay man living in a small town, and Robert Duvall has an eerie cameo as Karl's nearly.
90;The human tragedy, southern style, has rarely been portrayed with such pathos and authentic feel.
91;A good friend of mine, one who only watches critically acclaimed movies recommended this movie to me.
92;So I thought I'd give it a try.
93;I watched it with a couple friends which was good.
94;, then the middle 5, then the end 5 and you're good to go, and you didn't have to lose the 2 or 3 hours of your life to this movie.
95;I thought teletubbies were mind numbing on TV, well this is the lobatomization from the film industry.
96;My friends and I did find some entertainment, which was derived from the complete lack of effort we found in making fun of this movie during our viewing of it.
97;What a Heart Wrenching Tale of a Friendship between a really Special Man and a Family he befriends and vows to protect.
98;I've watched this movie in the past about 10 or so times and would recommend and watch it again with friends, family.
99;Pretty clean movie besides language, no nudity that I recall.
100;Billy Bob Thornton and surprisingly good acting on Dwight Yokam's part!
101;This by far is my favorite Billy Bob Thornton movie.
102;He is brilliant as Karl and his interaction with the other characters is enjoyable.
103;Billy Bob Thornton is wonderful in this movie.
104;He is a great actor.
105;Excellent condition, it came in a timely manner.
106;My spouse loves this movie.
107;We will order more movies now that we are aware of this excellent service.
108;This is the type of rare film that will literally leave the viewer stunned upon a first viewing.
109;With Sling Blade, Billy Bob Thornton unleashed one of the most powerful films and performances in the history of films.
110;From beginning to end, this jaw dropping film will amaze, horrify, and mystify the viewer.
111;Every emotion will be tapped and every one of your senses will be jolted.
112;The best part of all, upon several viewings it may not stun you as it did the first time, but, it will never cease to amaze and entertain you.
113;This is a high level, unique and extremely original film that deserved it's massive praise.
114;Very few films are instant classics, but, this unusual masterpiece is a prime example for when that happens.
115;"It is definately a ""must see."""
116;Conflict that is created by the development of the main characters.
117;I like it a lot.
118;This is the greatest movie I've ever seen.
119;It is so real, so sensative, so personal, so caring.
120;There is so much love this man has and so little he has ever gotten.
121;It is a must to see.
122;She tuen around and bought me one because she didn.
123;To me this is a classic.
124;I would recommend to all audiences above the age of 15.
125;I love this movie so much, I bought it for my daughter and I to watch together.
126;My thing is drama and suspense and/or a meaty story.
127;This is a one of a kind movie.
128;"All the characters were great and made the people seem real
129;I'll keep this short and sweet.
130;Slingblade is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
131;The relationship between Billy Bob's character and the little boy is so touching.
132;You find yourself engrossed in the way they relate to each other and ESPECIALLY their unique voices.
133;I loved the kid's accent!
134;There are so many endearing scenes that will stick in your mind for further recollections.
135;the movie draws so many emotions from watching.
136;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get angry, you'll sigh.
137;Slingblade is a must see.
138;wow, i watched sling blade last weekend and have been thinking about it often ever since.
139;cap the story here, but i will say that Sling Blade has everything that a great movie needs, most importantly, heart, honesty, and belief in the characters and the paths that they walk and run through.
140;carl's relationship with the young boy is relationship that i think only few people achieve, the simple bond of TRUST is what brings such a love between them.
141;billy bob thornton is one of my favorite actors, now directors, too.
142;it takes a deep man with a big heart to develop a story like this, even though part of me thinks it might've been a bit autobiographical in some parts, but who knows?
143;It had the deluxe edition with extra bonus features which she loved.
144;Billy Bob gives what will probably be his best performance ever in this small town drama.
145;Lucas Black also shows his talent at an early age has he befriends a slightly retarded Thornton.
146;john Ritter ane Dwight Yokum also give masterful perfomances to make this one of the best movies of the 90s.
147;it also has some of the most quotable lines of any movie in the last 15 years as well.
148;If you enjoy a good story with memorable characters, this is a film for you.
149;It's an indie film through.
150;through and is what great storytelling is all about.
151;first of all, the performance by Billy Bob Thornton is absolutely brilliant as Karl.
152;His character is very well portrayed and very accurate.
153;Believe me (I also have a B. a. in Psychology) his portrayal is absolutely perfect.
154;His actions, murmurings, and habits are very true to life.
155;dwight Yoakam's performance as Doyle the abusive and often cruel boyfriend is also very convincing.
156;It is said that ignorance is the enemy.
157;Probably because of his compassionate girlfriend.
158;Linda is a very compassionate person but she is also very co. dependent on Doyle.
159;I think that she allows this because she is very concerned with Frank's well.
160;I also believe that Linda has a very close relationship with her son and trusts his instincts.
161;sling Blade is beautifully written and acted.
162;The cinematography and setting are outstanding.
163;The characters are very real.
164;Sling Blade is a classic to be.
165;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema.
166;Karl is a genius at fixing small engines so after having been released from the institution, the head of the ward gets Karl a job at a friend's small engine shop fixing up lawnmowers and the likes.
167;They learn a lot about each other, and a lot about life itself.
168;by the end of the movie, Karl, in his mind, believes that for the boy and mother to be happy, he has to rid of them of this Doyle.
169;It's so hilarious that at first it caught me off guard and I had to rewind it to see the full benefit of it.
170;I just couldn't stop laughing and it was the most funniest thing I have ever seen in a movie in a very long time.
171;Billy Bob Thornton's hero is the symbol of the weakest of the weakest : the children, the women, .
172;the first 15 minutes of SLING BLADE are also a lesson of great cinema.
173;Karl, for the first and the last time, will talk freely, in the dark.
174;Let's hear the musical score of Daniel Lanois that goes with this scene.
175;Not a very fast paced movie, but exceptional acting.
176;BBT puts on a show!
177;one of the best actors out there today.
178;This is the first movie I saw him in and I was thoroughly impressed with his work.
179;Similar for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, their original screenplay for """"Good Will Hunting"""" winning a 1997 Oscar, both of them stars for playing the parts they wrote."""

187;Amazon had it available and shipped super fast.
188;Top drawer performances by entire cast.
189;While the film makes an important statement, it certainly should be recognized for the wonderful telling of beautiful story with an unfortunate ending.
190;Learn something new with every viewing.
191;This is my husbands favorite movie.
192;It is very a compeling story.
193;It keeps your interest and you feel for the characters.
194;my husband was very happy to add it to his movie collection.
195;The story is captivating and the characters are interesting.
196;Some of his best acting.
197;Not only is this movie about the downtrodden, but it is also a movie about a great sacrifice made in the name of love.
198;I do feel that Billy Bob Thornton found a very good director with Barry Markowitz to capture the feel of a small town.
199;Capturing the detail of the shop that Karl works at to the look and feel of the film that makes you wonder if it's late 1950's America or modern America.
200;Of course, it's the latter but the fact is that Thornton with Markowitz are able to capture look and feel of that small town quite well on film.
201;But for what they had at their disposal with the small budget they had to work with, you can't help but be proud at what this crew was able to accomplish.
202;The film is definitely dialogue driven.
203;There is a featurette dedicated to the use of music in the film but for the most part, this is a front and center channel driven film.
204;it's important to note that with this Blu.
205;A very informative commentary by Billy Bob Thornton.
206;Overall, a very enjoyable commentary.
207;A very cool roundtable with everyone talking about their memories of the film ten years later.

215;This is Independent filmmaking at its finest.
216;The ability to create a film that feels so natural, to shoot in a town that just feels right for the film and to cast well.
217;needless to say, this film is a true masterpiece and screenwriting at its best.

220;This is the theatrical cut which works perfectly.
221;"overall, ""SLING BLADE"" is a film that is solidified itself as a movie classic."
222;SLING BLADE is highly recommended!
223;He has improved himself and learned to read.
224;He's read the Bible and he reckons he understands it, mostly.
225;and there are some nice touches in between.
226;There's a great temptation, when writing of the down.
227;"When that happens we have a political movie, an ""I'm in favor of motherhood"" editorial instead of a film."
228;He had a very fine cast: he should have used them more and himself less.
229;John Ritter was close to brilliant as a small town, thirty.
230;Lucas Black, who played the boy was excellent.
231;I read the reviews on here and everything I read looked fascinating.
232;So I decided to give it a go.
233;Received the Blu Ray in excellent condition (sealed) and no damage.
234;So much that I could see food in Doyel's beard during the dinner table scene.
235;The music is so much more clean and lively!
236;This was worth every penny!
237;OK, this is a movie for a specific kind of folk, .
238;This is a great movie!
239;John Ritter plays the best role of his career in a character much more complex than what meets the eye.
240;Lucas Black is convincing as a young boy living a troubled existance in a small southern town.
241;If cinema is an art form, then this movie is a masterpiece.
242;Fantastic story, acting, dialogue, direction, and cinematography.
243;But rather than wallowing in the abyss, the movie manages to entertain with some well placed humor.
244;I have since become a huge fan of Thornton's work.
245;He was brilliant in A Simple Plan.
246;The man is one of our great actors but somehow doesn't seem to get the credit he deserves.
247;Really shows how the disadvantaged are treated even in this day and age.
248;This is one of the best performances ever by Billy Bob Thornton.
249;Lucas Black deserves praises also.
250;This man has an awesome talent.
251;i give it ***** plus many more.
252;one of billy bobs best performances ever.
253;movie had great depth and kept you wanting more.
254;I got this as a gift for my sister.
255;She highly recommends this all fans of Billy Bob Thornton.
256;There's no doubt, this is Billy Bob Thortons best performance!This is the first movie I ever saw him in.
257;The story, the acting,and everything about this movie, make it a true classic film!
258;I am always touched by the relationships in this movie.
259;I would highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys watching a movie with an original story.
260;Sling Blade The Director's Cut is an excellent addition to everyone's film collection.
261;For all who have watched the original theatrical release version of the film will definitely appreciate the extra scences included in the movie.
262;without movie stars with box office clout .
263;Carl, played brilliantly by Billy Bob Thornton, is a mentally.
264;Perhaps the best description for the film comes from one line of his dialogue, referencing the youngster that he paternally adopts as his own: That boy lives in his heart, and that's a mighty big place.
265;This was an interesting film but I kept waiting for something to actually HAPPEN (aside from what happened at the end, which we can all see coming from 1,000 miles away).
266;He should have been nominated for best supporting actor.
267;threat (starring/writing/directing)debut is an American masterpiece.
268;With portraying life in the South without ever being patronizing or stereotypical, this film about tortured soul Karl Childers, a simple yet disturbed man coming home after 25 years of being hospitalized for the murder of his mother and her lover at the age of 12, is quite frankly one of the last great American film classics of the past fifteen years.
269;It's all Thorton, and played amazingly.
270;"It's no wonder then in 1996, he won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay (""adapted"" due to his earlier 1994 short film version of Karl in ""Some Folks Call It A Sling Blade"") as well as being nominated that year for the Best Actor Oscar."
271;with additional and extended scenes that add to the film without altering the overall feel of the original.
272;Entertaining as well as informative, this film gets better and better with repeated viewings.
273;thank you for readin' I reckon, mm hm!
274;I absolutely love this movie, Billy Bob Thornton is a genius.
275;You learn early that he has murdered his mother and the mother's lover and is finally being released into the wider world of free people.
276;He soon makes friends with a young boy, and this is of course when the conflict begins.
277;"Thornton's character, Karl Childers, does a great deal to change the boy's life, ultimately insisting in the end, ""You Will Be Happy""."
278;Also memorable here are the characters played by the late JT Walsh and a highly underrated John Ritter.
279;A wholly surprising film with a unique and fresh script written by Thornton.
280;It took everyone by surprise.
281;As a director, he shows a keen eye for Just The Right Angle in many scenes, which results in an really aesthetically pleasing film.
282;On top of this, he also wrote the screenplay and developed all of the characters himself .
283;His choice of soundtrack pieces increases the film's overall beauty, and, as soundtracks should, drives home the action on the screen.
284;the subjects dealt with are very adult, and despite the charming relationship between Karl and Frank, the themes and ethics of the story may upset some people.
285;This is one of those movies I plan to pull out from time to time, simply because it's so enjoyable.
286;The performances are simple, yet understated and thus, work perfectly in the environment for which they are set.
287;hand what life is REALLY like, from a former southerner.
288;i still watch this film from time to time, just because it amazes me with its simple, yet poetic and tragic story line.
289;It is a work of great genius, and one that will haunt you long after you see it.
290;Billy Bob Thorntons Carl is one of the most memorable, heartbreaking characters ever portrayed on film.
291;If B. b. t. never makes another film, he should be revered as a brilliant artist.
292;his portrayal of Carl is a gift to the human race.
293;The transfer is new, with widescreen images unspooling at 1.85:1.
294;The sound is warm and clear but with some boominess.
295;the improbable success story of writer.
296;one of the best bits is a roundtable discussion with singer Dwight Yoakam (who turned heads playing a liquored.
297;"musician Mickey Jones (""Home Improvement""), producer David Bushnell and Thornton."
298;A lot of the talk is about music, which Thornton insists is at the heart of the movie.
299;"Lanois performs Karl's theme music and recalls the score as having ""a nice nave spirit."
300;Thornton goes home again to Arkansas in one of the segments, dispensing plenty of charm and backslaps.
301;Sling Blade is an excellent, thought.
302;one of the great aspects of the film is simply Billy Bob Thornton's portrayel of Karl.
303;Returning to the town he called home after 25 years in an institution, Karl must start life anew.
304;"Karl's simple nature is quite deceptive
305;He is one of the more memorable characters because of his unique mannerisms (trust me, you may find yourself grunting the words """"french fried potaters"""") and his plain honesty (he openly tells the boy he befriends exactly why he was locked up)."""
306;"Thornton, who also directed the film, does a masterful job at ""becoming"" the character of Karl."
307;"one underlying question that pervades from the film is ""what truly is a good human being?"""
308;overall, this was a quite touching, emotional story from Thornton.
309;It is told with a simple intention and premise, yet it is a film that is deeply complex.
310;This one has stayed in my head since then.
311;It was a truly wonderful experience for me.
312;"I had a lump in my throat throughout most of it
313;Rarely have I made such good use of a couple of hours.
314;From the beginning, I was hooked!
315;I can tell you, these people still live there!
316;She should have murdered Doyle herself, but other than that, it was one of the few movies that we both loved.
317;You'll find that same person writing sparkling reviews of Die Hard.
318;Billy Bob Thornton is one of today's most talented actors.
319;His ability to get into the skin of his character here is eerie.
320;The first time I saw the film I actually thought he was a mentally challenged actor!
321;SLING BLADE is a deeply effective drama, full of somber messages, yet with an innocent spirit of hope.
322;I especially enjoyed John Ritter who hasn't been around in quite a while.
323;In addition to solid acting, there is a weird soundtrack in the film which adds to the creepy mood but is perfect for the story.
324;Though disturbing, you WILL enjoy this movie.
325;This film has an incredible cast and location.
326;The feel is pure southern country.
327;I watch this movie over and over.
328;Must see TV for sure!
329;Like the credits indicated, it is a great movie
330;Billy Bob Thornton delivers another powerful and thought provoking script and acting with the making of Sling Blade.
331;boy, was I surprised to find such an outstanding picture.
332;It really brings one back to the truth that you can't judge a book by its cover.
333;I was again amazed at how Billy Bob Thornton transformed himself to play the starring role.
334;It is a real tribute to his acting ability.
335;just an absolutely amazing performance.
336;We all loved it, very touching!
337;billy bob is such a wonderful actor
338;Great shape fast service good price.
339;Love this movie and can watch it over and over again!!
340;Great story, great actors and a very good ending.
341;Karl is a very simple man and keeps to himself but is very eccentric.
342;Shortly after returning home, he makes a few friends and even gets a job.
343;just something to ponder on.
344;A person who sincerely wishes to change must take a hard and deep look at himself and within himself.
345;The subtext, and in my view, the genius of the film is that it depicts """"a true slice of Arkansas, thus American life: ."""
346;"It is a melodramatic ""grace note"" about Arkansan life."
347;The movie is tense, tightly written, honest and has an impending existential absurdity and urgency about it that keeps the audience on its toes.
348;"Billy Bob won an Oscar for best Adapted Screenplay
349;It represents the highest level creativity that Hollywood has to offer, and thus is unforgettable artistry.
350;It's a fantastic ride with an emotional story and great relationships.
351;For all of you that think that Jamie Foxx was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING in Ray, well, watch this movie because Billy Bob Thorton's performance is 10000000 times better.
352;Thornton wrote, directed and starred in this so just watch it for all of the effort that he put into it.
353;And his performance is absolutely breathtaking.
354;He'll make you laugh and cry your head off.
355;He's a student abusing her and she's enjoying it.
356;He just tells the story of how and what happened.
357;So for the whole movi, there is no violence that you see.
358;The movie is very powerful and emotional and is in my opinion appropriate for 13 years + children or mature children.
359;anywhere, from then Karl gets a job and meets a friend, Frank.
360;THis boyfriend is masterfully played by Dwight Yoakam.
361;When Karl moves in with Frank, the boyfriend gets mad and sparks fly.
362;Karl will then have to make a tough decision and will need to confront his past.
363;The movie has amazing performances by everyone including Billy Bob Thorton, Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter and the actor that played Frank.
364;tHe movie is the best when Karl and Frank are together.
365;They love each other and are best friends.
366;They protect each other and they both reveal their secrets.
367;You love Karl and I wanted to hug him.
368;He is a very kind troubled man and Frank is the loving boy who cares for him.
369;I recommend this movie to everyone and I will definitely add it to my top 25 movies.
370;And hopefully tonight, I'll enjoy American Beauty like I did this amazing movie.
371;thornton won a deserved award as best screenplayer in 1996.
372;There are many important issues in that film"
373;thornton is so well screnplayer as an actor.
374;He keeps to date as true promising hope.
375;a must see movie,the cast is incredible, the story so unique and true.
376;don't have to be a billy bob fan,it is by far his best attempt.
377;unlike a lot of moies,a great ending.
378;It's a very satisfying film.
379;It will make you cry but will also humble your heart.
380;It will make you cry, laugh, and get mad.
381;An outstanding film by any standards .
382;superbly directed, beautifully acted, an original story line and a rare build.
383;Its been a favorite of mine for a long time.
384;Its a masterpiece that could never be duplicated in my opinion.
385;The entire movie, scenes, dialog, feeling are all Billy Bob.
386;The most frightening movie I have ever seen.
387;"Karl gets to go ""home"" and finds that the world is a ""mighty big place"" to live in."
388;Although this movie has a dark side, it is a beautiful coming.
389;It also depicts life in a small town to a T.
390;Good job and keep up the good work.
391;It's an excellent movie and not available on Netflix or Movies on demand.
392;This is a great movie.
393;What a fantastic performance by Billy Bob Thorton!
394;I was impressed with the level he immersed himself in his character as a mentally ill patient guilty of double murder and being released from an institution.
395;I was mesmerized by his friendship with a young boy and intrigued by his own backstory.
396;This is a great movie that I will watch again very soon.
397;Sling Blade is the best Drama movie I've ever seen.
398;I'll have to say this is his best performance and he pulls it off very well.
399;He got put in the nut house for murdering his mom and her lover.
400;So Karl gets out and makes friends with a boy named Frank.
401;They become good friends in the movie and Karl moves in with them.
402;Things go great until Frank's mean step dad Doyle shows up.
403;Karl is fed up with the way Doyle treats his family, so Karl takes action!
404;Sling Blade has some very funny lines too.
405;Karl says some of the funniest things.
406;I laughed when he said quote in the movie to John Ritter's character.
407;He loves those biscuits with mustard too.
408;"This is one great movie though
409;It's funny, realistic, sad, and weird at times too.
410;Amazing Preformances and story line.
411;this is an awesome movie.
412;This is a classic movie I've been looking for to fit in with my collection.
413;Will view it over again with friends and relatives.
414;It turned out to be one of THE BEST movies I have ever seen.
415;He is befriended by a lonely boy whose mother allows him to stay in their garage.
416;Billy Bob Thornton literally transformed himself into Carl who is a simple, loving man with a really cool accent.
417;Sling Blade raises more questions than it answers during its running time which keeps the viewers attention.
418;After watching the film for about an hour it becomes pretty clear what is going to happen but never the less it is still an enthralling watch thanks in large part to the fantastic performances by Thornton, Yoakam, and Ritter.
419;This is undoubtedly one of the best films of the 90's.
420;Sling Blade is my favorite movie, and I'm so glad to now own this version in addition to the original.
421;The additional footage helps the plot make even more sense, and the optional commentary by Billy Bob Thornton is rich with insight.
422;He even does voice over commentary for the additional footage.
423;Whether you've seen the original or not, this is a must.
424;Billy Bob Thornton executes his role brilliantly and portrays a character with such understated brilliance that it ranks with the finest character roles ever performed.
425;The story unfolds with tender care, sensitivity and rythmn.
426;in the end, it is a love story between an institutionalized man and a young boy .
427;The ending is satisfying and right.
428;fully deserving its awards and recognition.
429;Billy Bob Thornton is a genius, no two ways about.
430;Not since William Faulkner, has anyone told the story of the south so vividly and passionately.
431;star, director and writer of this amazing film.
432;is the greatest southern voice since William Faulkner.
433;This film is essential southern gothic retooled for the New South of mini.
434;Besides being an incredibly important film about the South, it's emotional rollercoaster ride: from Carl (Thornton) and his shocking past, to the awkwardness of his first days away from institutionalization, to the amazing paternal relationship he forges with a neglected boy.
435;Hearing a comedian making fun of the main character's voice, I wasn't sure if this movie was for me.
436;I am glad I watched the movie anyway, because this is a fine film.
437;This film is filled with interpretations as people struggle to have their interpretation understood.
438;Everyone will try to make life into what they hope it would be.
439;this is a very good film, and I would highly recommend seeing it.
440;note performance from Thornton (whom I've liked in other films), up there with Sean Penn's performance in """"I Am Sam."""""""
441;If you liked that, you may enjoy this.
442;Well, by all means, move in with US!
443;I bought it and its a great moviegood choice
444;The director's cut shows additional scenes.
445;Strongly recommend it to everyone, even if you've seen the movie before.
446;"Well, he proves his skill as an actor by playing the complete opposite side of the spectrum in this movie, a ""slow"" man released from a psychiatric hospital where he had been for a few decades after he murdered his mother and stepfather."
447;down the best performance I've seen from Thornton, and I have the utmost repect for him after this movie.
448;It's even more incredible that he wrote and directed the movie, in adding to his starring performance.
449;It is a sadder movie, but it's also a movie about finding friendship in the unlikliest places, and what family means.
450;The small town setting shows is a contrast between some of the most loving and accepting people in the world and some of the most close.
451;watch this once to see both Thornton at the top of his game and John Ritter in an outstanding role as a gay grocery store worker.
452;"But Karl is deemed to be safe for society and he is also a man with a good heart that when asked if he will do it again replies,""I don't reckon I got no reason to kill nobody."""
453;karl befriends a young boy named Frank, and the two are friends from the start.
454;Karl gets a job working on small engines at a local garage and lives there for a while, but Frank and his mother agree it would be good for Karl to live with them.
455;Doyle is constantly belittling Frank and Vaughn (a friend of Frank's mother who is gay), and is verbally and physically abusive to Linda (Frank's mom).
456;this is an incredible movie that deserves all of the notariety is has collected since its release.
457;It won many awards, and deservingly so.
458;The movie is nothing short of perfect though and it is definately one that you need to see in your lifetime.
459;I love this movie, it is a classic.
460;Great movie, and excellent present.
461;Billy Bob Thornton great performance, Lucas Black same great performance as a actor show with what happenes way down south of yesteryear a must see film .
462;enjoy regards jim.Y down under
463;this movie brings a touching and personal story to the discussion that is pertinent to all of our lives.
464;SLING BLADE with give more meat for us to chew on, concerning all the topics it brings up.
465;Consider the subject matter, sensitivity, maturity level and age group, when inviting anyone to view this film.
466;Much depth, much feeling, much love, in the midst of chaos!
467;this is possibly the most powerful movie i've ever seen.
468;it is the best movie i've ever seen.
469;This is a movie I could watch again and again.
470;Billy Bob does an excellent job of being Carl.
471;Would definitely recommend it unless you demand that every little part of it fits together like a puzzle!
472;"I like this movie ""Sling Blade"" and glad that I bought it."
473;This is one of the few times you'll see Dwight without a cowboy hat.
474;i enjoyed it and recommend it.
475;Sling Blade is a simple story that focuses on a simple man.
476;It is a beautiful film that focuses on realism as it's main weapon.
477;As was the case with 'The Apsotle', Sling Blade takes every day people and places the camera on them.
478;"Of course, it doesn't merely stop there
479;this films involves a number of delicious elements.
480;We see friendship between the oddest of people:.
481;it's a life that is simple, involving loyalty, love, understanding for one another, and the urgency to protect those who can't defend themselves.
482;character is seen as a man destined for heaven, despite Karl's knowledge of what the Bible says .
483;this film is raw and moves along without apologies for the simple fan of the """"spell everything out for me movies"""" genre."""
484;Sling Blade is a classic and will forever be one of my favorite movies, despite what some films critics say.
485;This movie is an excellent portrayal of good over evil.
486;One of the best films ever made.
487;Billy Bob Thornton is a true genius.
488;Dwight Yoakam gives a wonderful performance.
489;This is a touching film that you will never forget and you will want to see it again!!
490;It helps us all to realize that everyone has a heart and everyone deserves a chance.
491;"Alternately haunting and sweetly affecting, ""Sling Blade"" is a beautifully accomplished debut by actor."
492;director Billy Bob Thornton, who conceived, wrote, directed and starred in this absorbing drama.
493;(He won an Oscar for his original screenplay.)
494;Sling Blade (1996) is an acting tour de force for Billy Bob Thornton who wrote, directed, and starred in this powerful film.
495;"when his time is up, and Karl is gauged ""safe,"" he has to face the outside world."
496;in talking to the boy Karl reveals something he did at age eight on orders from his mother and father.
497;it's a brilliant movie, one that will hold your attention even with its melodrama and questionable position or lack of it on Karl's actions.
498;brilliantly acted and original drama that is a thought.
499;"written movie that moves the viewer and made Karl one of the most memorable screen characters ever that ranks up there with Raymond Babbit from ""Rain Man"" and Forrest Gump plus it made Billy Bob Thorton a star."
500;The film co. stars John Ritter as a gay store owner, Robert Duvall as Karl's long lost father and J. t. Walsh, the film is a powerful and sad film experience that i strongly recommend!
501;star Billy Bob Thorton with great extras like interviews, a featurette on Billy Bob's road to stardom, a Bravo profile featurette on Billy Bob and reviews of the movie.
502;the portrayal is absolutely and uncannily accurate.
503;so, based on my own personal knowledge and experience, I very highly recommend this movie!
504;I owned this movie but bought it again to have it in blue.
505;Funny that after spending that much time in confinement, the coordinator is somehow completely in the dark about Karl's [lack of] family ties.
506;Born and raised in the rural south, Childers is a man of quiet wisdom and simple needs.
507;He returns to the town of his birth to find he is a total stranger with a need to re.
508;Thornton gives an originally crafted performance, which leads the way into and through this film of emotional rollercoasters.
509;book portrayal of how one's attitude towards life affects relationships with others as well as one's destiny.
510;When I first saw Sling Blade back in 1996, I was immensely moved by Thornton's portrayal of a mentally retarded man trying to assimilate into the world from which he was cast years ago for killing his mother and her lover.
511;It was, to me, a perfect movie from beginning to end.
512;That was such a brilliant and moving scene.
513;So for me to have missed that and still enjoyed the film immensely .
514;well, like I said earlier, duh.
515;Thornton won the oscar for his screenplay (I have it)!
516;He was up for Best Actor, too!
517;And he should have won that as well.
518;"The film that launched Billy Bob Thornton's career, ""Sling Blade"", is one of the most stirring films released over the past dozen years."
519;Reading Thornton's face is to read his mind and the entire film is brilliantly paced.
520;The supporting cast, led by a young Lucas Black, is terrific.
521;Sling Blade is worth viewing more than once for its nuanced dialogue and heart.
522;This is a masterpiece that will play with your emotions.
523;This Oscar winner stars Academy Award winning Billy Bob Thornton as `Karl', a grown man that gets discharged from a institution and develops a strong new friendship with a fatherless boy.
524;this film also has John Ritter, Robert Duvall, J. t. Walsh and Grammy Award winner Dwight Yoakam.
525;His character as `Karl' was absolutely magnificent.
526;The late John Ritter backs the cast nicely in what was probably his greatest film role.
527;This is one of the greatest films I've ever viewed and Billy Bob Thorton is absolutely amazing.
528;Thorton was nominated for Best Actor, but didn't win and instead won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay and rightfully so.
529;The film is powerful, it's got a sacrafice theme to it and the end of the film (if not semi.
530;Now, I love this movie and almost every thing about it.
531;This movie is outstanding and should have won an award for Billy Bob Thornton.
532;He was excellent and played someone so out of character for him.

539;making, the bygone era known as the 90's, SLINGBLADE deftly and eerily combines the wholesome everyman small town ideals of a Norman Rockwell painting with the morbid Southern Gothic tone of William Faulkner's best prose.

546;The bloodiest moments are reserved for off camera.
547;employing the audience's imaginations to create far more vibrant images than any camera could provide.
548;He understands the power of word pictures.
549;He also displays a brilliant ability to oscillate a scene from chilling to hilarious to tragic on a turn of a phrase.
550;and at the center of this dark fairy tale is Thornton himself, transformed completely into the character of Karl Childers.
551;thornton's Karl Childers is one of the greatest characters ever created for film.
552;Like the fatherless Frank, the simple minded Childers is pure of heart and in a state of grace and yet he possesses a terrifying capacity for violence.
553;His heart, like the story.
554;He has been a model patient, and is eventually deemed fit for release back into society.
555;His first encounter outside of the hospital is with a young boy Frank (Lucas Black) and his mother Linda (Natalie Canerday), who take him into their home and treat him with dignity and kindness.
556;I would definitely recommend the movie.
557;I enjoyed the movie and I found it worth the time I invested in watching it.
558;The characters were well developed, and I was able to become emotionally attached to Karl's character as well as Frank, his mother, and Vaughan while they tried in vain to coexist with Doyle and his abusive ways.
559;Cant stop telling me he he loves it
560;"released ""Sling Blade"", Billy Bob Thornton's masterpiece."
561;Every fan Billy Bob has is going to love it!!!!!!
562;I didn't ever, but believe me those words were worth waiting for.
563;i loved the fact that we were made privy to so much of the behind.
564;scenes information and so much of Billy Bob's personal likes, dislikes, goals, and feeling about this movie his fans have so grown to love and associate with his artistic genius.
565;how I have loved this story, these actors, and the entire beauty of this work and how I love it even more now that I have been given access to Billy Bob's special introspection.
566;Second, my feelings about the film are so 'deep and personal to me' and so 'respective and humbled.
567;genius of Billy Bob', that I could never find the words to review the film in even a semi.
568;For those who have seen the movie and liked it, if you haven't done so yet.
569;treat yourself to more and watch it again, but this time in all its glory .
570;This movie went right to my heart.
571;billy Bob turned into Carl, great acting
572;Opened this up and watched it the day I got the movie in the mail.
573;He understands and appreciates kindness given to him ( that boy has a big heart and lives inside it ).
574;I have always liked this movie.
575;The directors cut is just that much better.
576;I am not a big Billy Bob Thorton fan but this is a good movie.
577;Such an awesome story, with an awesome cast!
578;The supporting cast was phenomenal .
579;It was a great movie to do a psychological on the individual for a college class requirement and share with the class.
580;this movie should be a classic.
581;more appreciation as i got older
582;What an outstanding job Billy Bob Thornton did in this movie.
583;An amazingly and deeply touching story of a man whose life had no chanceat being anything but horrible from the moment he was conceived, yet he becomesa Divine Instrument in the life of one little boy.
584;A great seller that delivers on time on and you cannot beat the price.
585;Thanks for the service and i am telling my friends.
586;And they said they will be checking it out.
587;I have enjoyed this movie, since it first came to big screen.
588;Its a classic that everyone needs in thier collection.
589;This is a movie with a good message, but it is so full of foul language that we will not watch it again!
590;recieved movie sling blade in very prompted time and was in very good shape , made a nice add to my movie collection.
591;Reminds me of some people I've actually encountered over the years.
592;kind of creeps me out though.
593;Plus, you'll see one of the best acting performance from a man ever in his lifetime.
594;will Probably Watch It 8 More Times At Least.
595;I understand that it was written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton and he did a great job except for the one major female part.
596;A small point, I know, but I did wonder about it in an otherwise perfect movie.
597;Watching Sling blade again on ABC last night reminded me just how much I truly love this film.
598;It's one of my all time favorites.
599;the beauty of this movie is how it connects with it audience on so many levels, but ultimately, at its core, one finds soul and a deep connection to God.
600;The film expresses the meaning of true friendship (the boy and Carl), fatherhood (Carl's fatherly instincts), fatherly.
601;figure), loyalty (Carl's loyalty to the boy and his mother), tenderness (Carl's understanding and reconciliation of his brother, who died immediately after birth), and grace (Carl's ability to ease the tension living in the boy, due to his tough upbringing).
602;as a father of two young boys myself, something about this movie hits a deep nerve.
603;But Karl does begin his life on the outside and befriends a boy who is as lonely as he is.
604;While it is sad, I'm glad I saw it, because the story was fascinating and all of the actors were extraordinary.
605;Thornton is unrecognizable as the simple man with a cruel past, and his performance is utterly convincing.
606;Lucas Black, as the boy, is also excellent and John Ritter has a very good role as a gay shopkeeper.
607;This is considered a classic to me.
608;Bill Bob Thornton is superb.
609;Billy Bob Thorton does a great job portraying the protagonist of this movie.
610;The story about a small town and it's people.
611;The best thing about it is a little scene where our hero is sharpening his blade, and you know why.
612;Turned up weeks before i thought it would and is in excellent condition.
613;this is one of my favorite movies of all time!!
614;billy bob does a fantastic job!!
615;i recommend this movie to all sensitive people who care about mentally impaired people and how they live and think
616;And Billy Bob thorton does do a good job playing this character I still find myself liking him better as a crazy jerk.
617;It's a ery good movie
618;I'd thought that the director's cut of this extraordinary film would go to Blu.
619;That version fleshes out the story a bit more and introduces us to Frank's girl interest.
620;It's a brilliant story and a moving film.
621;This is the first time I can remember seeing Billy Bob Thornton on film.
622;I didn't know what to make of him at first, but he proved himself a good actor and that made me want to see him in other films.
623;Truly one of my favorite movies ever!
624;All the actors, and especially the little boy, were great.
625;It was a very fuzzy and blurred picture.
626;I've watched this film many times, and I love every moment of it.
627;This addition also gives us a second disk with interviews with Billy Bob thornton, other actors, friends and family members of Billy Bob Thornton.
628;Each character in this film is well cast and well directed, and are all believable in their roles.
629;This film tells us, and reminds us, that the human condition can still love and be loved notwithstanding the tragic conditions and or the circumstances of a human being.
630;This film is one of my all time greats and a must see.
631;Humans can choose good and evil no matter the circumstances under which we must live and still transcend to goodness.
632;it man who gives him a job, for instance.
633;It is surprising to find such understanding and delicacy in a rural town.
634;But the boy Frank is a winner.
635;He comes across as sweet, articulate, and one day a worthy adult.
636;every time we order movies we are always very satisfied.
637;our movies are always delivered in excellent shape.
638;we will continue to order movies.
639;Billy Bob Thornton is pure genius here, with a remarkable turn as writer/director/star of Sling Blade.
640;Thornton is channeling this astounding archetype, a character that communicates to us in a profound, emotional level.
641;He has pieces of all of us inside him, and genuine nobility that defies easy understanding.
642;john Ritter's performance is also astonishing as a gay store manager.
643;(Ritter always seemed quite effeminate to me, and those characteristics shine here.)
644;will Thornton every do anything as good ever again?
645;He's left a profound mark.
646;Beneath the surface, however, it's intelligent, meaningful, and true to human nature.
647;Sling Blade will be sure to make you examine yourself and think about true, selfless sacrifice.
648;One of my favorite in my collection.
649;He has made so many people I know enjoy movies more and morewith his works.
650;The name put me off but a friend sent it and insisted I watch it, wow he was right.
651;What an impact this movie made on me!
652;Can say, analogy wise, been there and have gone back to my cage.
653;Mr. Thornton I considered this one of the greatest films I have seen in many a year.
654;I will definitely use this service again soon.
655;Billy Bob Thornton took his screenplay and directed himself in this unforgettable film.

657;karl is an essentially good man who is mentally challenged.
658;so just watch the movie!

660;Karl is a simple man with a pretty well.
661;developed sense of right and wrong.
662;there are many serious and tender and hilarious and moving scenes, and most of them involve Billy Bob's Karl.

664;This movie will stick with you long after you have seen it.
665;SlingBlade is on the top of all movies.
666;billy Bob Thornton, makes this movie believable.
667;John Ritter makes the movie funny, Dwight Yoakam makes the movie 'dark' and Lucas Black makes the movie unforgettable.
668;the scenes at the lake are the most memorable.
669;The script, the mood, and the way the scenes were filmed should be studied by film makers everywhere.
670;This movie for me was an inspiration to make those times as few as possible.
671;minded maniac and finally bring peace love and happiness to all those who we're there, and witness it.
672;I bought this movie as a gift for a friend of mine and I also own one myself.
673;It's an excellent story of humanity at its very best and very worst.
674;"Every emotion is touched in this story
675;It really restores my faith in humanity each time I watch it.
676;he truly is a great actor.
677;there was also great acting by actor.
678;I think this is Billy Bob Thornton's finest work.
679;All of the acting is great in this movie.
680;The relationship between """"Karl"""" and """"Frank"""" is so endearing and heart wrenching at the same time."""
681;The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly.
682;"It's in my ""favorites"" category."
683;Beautifully portrayed characters, some simple, some abusive, some innocent, but all complex and interesting.
684;Yet, the story is about tender emotions between Carl and the little boy.
685;one to keep your interest throughout.
686;This is a gritty drama about innocence and purity and triumph over the cruelty of human kind.
687;Mr. Thorton is Quite a talented man!
688;Bobby Bob Thorton is the best actor ever, especially in the movie.
689;It's a movie you want to share with others.
690;Story and acting were refreshing.
691;This is a real movie.
692;I just saw this movie for the first time this afternoon, and I was hooked.
693;billy Bob Thornton as Karl was brilliant as a mentally disabled man.
694;(She has a battered woman complex, for sure.)
695;So, after causing all of this turmoil and pain, when he comes around and apologizes, she just lets him right back into their lives.
696;He gives all of his books to Frank, and makes him promise that he will take his mother and go to Vaughan's house that evening.
697;He gives all of the money he made at his job to Vaughan, telling him to give it to Frank and Linda to help out, and makes him promise that he will watch over the two and be a good father to Frank.
698;it was a wonderful story that you will not stop thinking about for hours after watching it.
699;While that would not have been my course of action, you could see how this is the best he could come up with.
700;He loved Frank so much that he wanted him to be happy and safe, and this is the only way he thought he could do this.
701;Karl also seemed very overwhelmed with the outside world, and he really wanted to go back to the hospital where he spent most of his life.
702;But at least now, his life is richer for having found Frank, and being able to give him a better shot at happiness and safety gave Karl a sense of purpose to at least somebody.
703;Will be enjoying this a lot, Thanks!
704;It sounded really interesting so I ordered it.
705;My husband and I loved this movie.
706;Billy Bob's acting for this character was absolutely incredible.
707;Many actors want to take a turn at directing and some do quite well.
708;Dwight Yoakum does a fine acting job as the woman's abusive boyfriend.
709;John Ritter is funny and sweet as a gay store owner in a small town.
710;This viewer was just awed by Mr. Thornton's excellent portrayal of the mentally challenged man.
711;around good script, good acting and good directing.
712;"The real impact of Sling Blade lies in the way the movie draws the audience into sympathy with Karl, the ""mentally retarded"" protagonist who has spent 20 years in an institution after murdering his mother and her young lover."
713;As a result, there is a temptation to see his final act in the light of self.
714;That is the heart of the matter, because if we do see it that way, we have been seduced into applauding the brutal murder of a man who is clearly not the embodiment of evil that Karl is led to believe.
715;"There are delicious clues: e. g., Karl's repeated comment that he has read the Bible and understood a good bit of it, but ""not all of it""."
716;"He means the boy no harm
717;But there is truth in what he says, and value in being able to distinguish the message from the messenger.
718;A clever and effective movie.
719;The rapport between Carl and the boy was excellent.
720;Very believable, I could watch this movie over and over again.
721;This is a dark but beautiful motion picture.
722;Filled with nuance, both subtle and stark.
723;Layered with a remarkably breathless, bittersweet tone.
724;it's one of those rare, one of a kind movies that will leave you mesmerized.
725;The first type will visit a lake and see.
726;The second type will visit a lake and wonder.
727;exactly what lies below?This film is for that second type.
728;the director's cut is highly recommended for this particular movie.
729;for others, they will be touched in a most unforgetable way.
730;John Ritter has a great part as a gay shopkeeper who tries to alleviate his own loneliness by spilling his guts out to Thornton's uncomprehending character.
731;She is involved in an abusive relationship and keeps both her and her son's life in peril because she doesn't want to be lonely.
732;Billy Bob Thornton did an awesome job in this movie!
733;One of the best movies ever!
734;the video was a gift so i havent watched it but it did make someone else awful happy and for that we are grateful.
735;came in a timely manner so i will just give you an A+.
736;we looooooooooove a good price!
737;Movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and my comfort' movie but as usual, with Amazon Video, it is impossible to watch a movie I PAID for since it constantly FREEZES up my screen or sound gets off track.
738;This is a perfect example of how a film should hold your interest.
739;It is completely mesmerizing and it does this without over the top situations and explosions.
740;The great script,cast and acting will keep you glued to the screen!
741;This is a true work of art!
742;Thorton and Ritter are exceptional in roles that could very easily have been laughed at, if not done with so much restraint, the entire cast is in top form in this engrossing film.
743;I enjoyed this movie very much.
744;Sling Blade is simply a GREAT movie, already a classic.
745;It is better each time I watch it.
746;What a movie!The script is absolutely amazingly written.
747;The dialogue is tremendous and doesn't feel scripted at all.
748;the direction is extremely well done.
749;No jumpy, trendy camera changes, and beautiful solo shots that really help to develop the characters.
750;the absolute high point is the acting.
751;Everyone in this movie is tremendous.
752;Thornton does such an amazing job, that it's hard to believe it's him.
753;Which I think is the greatest thing an actor can do, make you forget its them.
754;Yoakam as the abusive boyfriend does an excellent job, second only to Thornton.
755;Canerday is great as the boy's mother, she portrays he character with utter realism (a woman that knows her situation is awful, but doesn't know how to deal with it).
756;The script, direction, and acting are all tremendous.
757;I would recommend this film to anyone that wants to see a great movie.
758;This is one of Billy Bob Thorntons best.
759;The story is a good one and the acting by Billy Bob and the boy are amazing.
760;So if she's happy I'm happy also!
761;Just another item that my son asked for for Christmas!
762;all actors were perfect for the characters they played and billy bob thornton was amazing.
763;I'm not one to watch a movie more than once, but this was so great I have seen it 4 times since I bought it last year.
764;This is a fantastic movie.
765;minded person with an understanding for special needs people.you'll love this one.
766;Many of us that have seen this movie have agreed we believe it's Billy Bob Thornton's best ever.
767;Slingblade offers a very touching look at the relationship between a mentally ill man and a young boy who seemingly needs any semblance of a father figure in his life.
768;The late great Jon Ritter offers little masculine comfort to the boy as he is gay in the film, but provides priceless moments in his attempts to understand this mentally ill man who has forged a bond with a family he holds dear.
769;All the while, Doyle (the mother's boyfriend) provides some of the funniest and despicable moments in film with his conservative red.
770;His strong sense of misdirected justice draws you in and leaves you to question whether or not he should be blamed.
771;A powerful film that I use for instruction.
772;It is entertaining from the word go, and a jewel in film seldom discussed.
773;billy bob did an outstanding portrayal.
774;the little boy did a good job acting as well.
775;the villain was very convincing.
776;billy Bob Thorton's acting was amazing in this film.
777;highly recommend adding to any video collection.
778;I love the move Sling Blade.
779;I have been hearing about this movie for years, and finally got to watch it.
780;He's pretty slow in the brain but he's aware of that fact and he's okay with it"
781;the cast, the story, the cinematography and everything else about this film are just tops.
782;John Ritter is INCREDIBLE in this very personal movie.
783;Thornton captures the epitome of hate and love in this tender reckoning.
784;I really love this movie!
785;The music was moving as well and I would venture to say that only someone that has had a very troubled childhood could possibly relate.
786;Billy Bob Thorton does a great job.
787;All I can say is that I wanted French Fried Taters after watching this movie.
788;It was a very interesting movie.
789;I loved John Ritter and Dwight Yokum in this movie.
790;They served up their acting chops on a silver platter.
791;best film Thornton has done.
792;bittersweet story of protection of someone you care for.
793;I found that it was a very good movie with a lot of very good acting.
794;I especially liked the role that John Ritter played as a gay grocer in a small Southern town.
795;I liked the way the movie was written and, as I suspect was true of many, I truly enjoyed the character of Karl played by writer/director Billy Bob Thornton.
796;His job of directing was pretty good as well.
797;The way he used a local TV crew to ferret out the facts from this quiet criminal was a great touch.
798;The way his relationship developed between him and a young fatherless boy was a joy to watch.
799;the movie does an excellent job of getting us interested in Karl's life and his interaction with others.
800;analyzing and otherwise excellent movie.
801;Each of the actors played their parts perfectly.
802;Billy Bob Thornton will have a tremendous job of ever doing a better job in another movie than he did in this.
803;Each of the rest of the actors, Lucas Black was perfect for the part of the boy who was about to be 'shut out' by his single mother's lover(Dwight Yoakam).
804;Best video you'll see in a looooog time.
805;I will tell you how it was told and give some information that may increase the joy and insight that you can get from this masterpiece.
806;Real life takes time and is filled with little telling events that you can unlock if you are a good listener, and not just another speaker waiting to talk.
807;in 1955 a retarded adult neighbor named Ike played baseball with us in our small Illinois town.
808;The underlying moral plane proves that a film maker can give the answer in the question he or she poses.
809;A wonderful suspension of my disbelief.
810;"There are those born into this world with a seemingly endless capacity for ""life""."
811;"It's a proposition put forth by writer/director/star Billy Bob Thornton, in ""Sling Blade,"" an emotionally charged drama that seeks out the best within the least of us."
812;And now, thrown back into the world, he returns to the small Arkansas town where he grew up.
813;"old boy, Frank (Lucas Black), and the two quickly ""make friends,"" in the purest sense, thanks to Frank's intuitive response, generated by the non judgmental innocence of youth, which allows the boy to see Karl as a person, rather than as an object of disdain."
814;And this simple act of friendship awakens in Karl something he has never known.
815;through care and understanding, the world can at least be a better place.
816;it's a dramatic statement to make, and Thornton makes it directly, through the insightful presentation of his characters, all of whom are sharply drawn, honest and definitive, and with situations and dialogue that rings true throughout the film.
817;"Still, some of the most telling moments are found in the silence of Karl's reflections
818;In Karl, Thornton has created a character who is something of a study in contradiction, a complex individual who at his core is actually quite simple and uncomplicated, yet possessed of deep.
819;that he becomes oddly endearing and readily evokes the empathy of the audience.
820;Without question, this is Thornton's most emotionally powerful performance ever, for which he deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor (in a year in which Geoffrey Rush took home the gold for """"Shine"""")."""
821;director Thornton supported his dynamic portrayal of Karl by extracting some extraordinary performances from his terrific cast of actors, beginning with the work of young Lucas Black, who presents Frank in terms that are altogether natural and unassuming.
822;And John Ritter is effective as the supportive Vaughan Cunningham, turning in a performance that is quite real and convincing, as does Natalie Canerday, as Frank's mother, Linda.
823;"A remarkable and unforgettable film, ""Sling Blade"" is a journey of emotional discovery that is absorbing and absolute."
824;Sling Blade is definitely one of my favorites, right up there with Fargo, Mars Attacks and Blazing Saddles.
825;Very nicely done and was well worth the couch time.
826;this beautifully made movie of a struggle between good and evil has as its major concern the development and safety of Frank, the young boy.
827;Vaughan, the other good adult, is equally incapable of helping Frank.
828;carl displays many of the characteristics of servant leadership delineated by Spears (Greenleaf, Beazley, Beggs, and Spears, 2003, pp. 16.19), notably listening, empathizing, and healing, and his effect on the other players is equally remarkable in servant.
829;"The scene is understated and contemplative in its vignette of community building, with wry humor that reveals the fact that everyone at the store knows that Vaughan and Albert are lovers, which Vaughan thought was a secret, echoing the movie's theme of a world that is ""too big"" ."
830;spirited for sensitive people to live unharmed lives.
831;carl also displays the qualities of foresight and commitment to the growth of people in his relationship with Frank.
832;He acts as Frank's protector but also returns himself to the contrastingly small world of the mental hospital, where he spends most of his time sitting in a chair, looking out the window.
833;there is much more detail and nuance to this movie that I can't capture in a couple of paragraphs, but the movie is melancholy and deep and well worth watching.
834;Billy Bob is a classic actor throughout this movie.
835;I just love this movie it is so heart warming.
836;it shows that people from all walks of life can be friends and care for each other and have special bonds.
837;A fine story of a sad, disturbed mind.
838;You'll watch with interest from start to finish!
839;Billy Bob Thornton's astonishing, haunting, mesmerizing SLING BLADE DIRECTOR'S CUT (Miramax) arrives in a new edition with almost 15 minutes of additional footage and an amazing commentary track from writer, director, actor Thornton.
840;a second disc is jammed with highly watchable extras.
841;There is a profound truth to Thornton's mentally challenged but morally centered Childers that will stay with you forever.
842;driven tale is an extraordinary creative riff that is certainly equal to the best of William Faulkner or Flannery O'Connor (Thornton won an Oscar for his screenplay).
843;This edition of the Southern gothic fable is one for the library.
844;The enjoyment in this film is when a tear fills your eye, your neck and throat become tight and you have to grit your teeth to stop the never.
845;It does have something to do with being a simple, knowing what is right type of person.
846;i give this film a SIX star rating on a scale from 1 to 5.
847;"Set in a small, rural Southern town, Billy Bob Thornton`s ""Sling Blade"" is so flavorful in ambiance and tone, so rich in character and theme that it's hard to believe that its roots are not to be found in any short story or novel."
848;"For while it has all the earmarks of a great work of literature, ""Sling Blade"" is actually an original creation by Thornton, the triple threat talent who wrote, directed and stars in the work."
849;"thanks to Carl's ""strangeness"" and homicidal background, as well as the simmering volatility and mercurial temperment of Doyle, there is always the threat of violence hanging ominously over the work."
850;"Yet, in many ways, ""Sling Blade"" is really about the goodness of people in their willingness to overlook external differences and to find the similarities that unite us all in a common bond of humanity."
851;lipped smile, jutting jaw, vacant expression and guttural throat.
852;The actor we've known from so many other movies is completely invisible in this role, as he literally becomes Karl in every fiber of his being and, in so doing, forces us to see the wisdom and humanity buried deep inside the person.
853;as a writer, Thornton has shaped his film like a modern day parable .
854;As a director, he proves himself a master of rhythm and pacing, setting the mood and allowing the scenes to play themselves out without recourse to overstatement or melodrama.
855;In fact, this is one of those rare movies in which every moment feels just right, so confident is Thornton in his ability as a filmmaker to bring his story to life on screen.
856;He also knows how to make the bucolic setting come across as both stark and sensuous at the same time, a place of quiet stillness that provides the perfect backdrop for the morality tale he is endeavoring to tell.
857;Finally, Daniel Lanois has provided a haunting musical score that ever so subtly draws us into the disturbingly offbeat world of the drama.
858;Sling Blade earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Thornton, but he should also have won awards for his directing and his performance as Karl, not to mention the film itself which should have won the honor as Best Picture of 1996 .
859;"Ah well, even with that lapse in judgment, ""Sling Blade"" remains one of the great movie dramas of the past decade."
860;Incredible performance by Billy Bob Thornton, what a transformation from the real actor .
861;I watch this movie 3.4 X a year .
862;the film was excellent !!
863;Billy Bob Thornton's best roll by far.
864;Dwight Yoakum was also a pleasant surprise , I had no idea he was that good an actor , especially for what I would say had to be a difficult part.
865;I really enjoyed this movie.
866;Billy Bob is an exceptional performer.
867;"I think that ""Sling blade"" is a rather trivial film (its characters did not seem to me to be fully developed, etc.), but it is not overly pretentious and it is touching."
868;I recommend you to see it.
869;never seen this movie but its a great flick and it was a good price for this movie!!
870;This was truly an amazing movie.
871;I loved every minute of it.
872;Billy Bob Thornton created a masterpiece based on realistic personalities and a scenario that rings true.
873;Such a rich, deserving film and Look ma, no animated monsters!
874;I saw this movie years ago and loved it it's a plus that I got the directors cut I think it has a little more detail than I remembered
875;Yes Thornton was amazing with his conversion to his character, but that was about it.
876;He helps a young boy, Frank (Lucas Black) carry his laundry home and the two become fast friends.
877;He gets a job, with help, working at a small engine repair shop.
878;"'Sling Blade' is the story of Karl's ""free"" life and his friendship with Frank."
879;It's a story of awakenings, one that will leave you breathless with the beauty of it.
880;It's about the purest form of love, and the ugliest side of domestic abuse.
881;I was deeply moved by the hidden bravery of Vaughan, who's terrified of Doyle but stands up for Linda and Frank even though he knows he's incapable of physically defending them.
882;There's the quiet reflectiveness of Karl, who's spent a lifetime inside his own head and now has to deal with people on a daily basis.
883;"You'll see the ""battered women's syndrome"" in Linda, a kind soul who only sees the beauty in every person, even Doyle."
884;the acting in this movie is outstanding.
885;Billy Bob Thornton, who also wrote and directed the movie, is amazing as Karl.
886;He gives a stunning performance as the sadistic Doyle, he makes the role as real as life, an absolutely amazing performance.
887;Yoakam and Thornton are both naturals in front of the camera.
888;The talent in this film is astonishing.
889;"This performance is unlike any I have ever seen before, and I was riveted from the beginning to the end and was surprised that some people stated it was long
890;His WALK, every movement, his speech, his gutteral tones, all are wonderful and mesmerizing"
891;"The boy, Frank, is fantastic, very real and believable, and Dwight Yoakum was so good and scary I didn't even realize I was watching Dwight Yoakum
892;All in all, a very satisfactory ending, and a truly original and amazingly well.
893;To me, Sling Blade is byfar Billy Bob Thorton's best performance in a movie to date.
894;Not only did Billy Bob star in it, he also written and directed it as well.
895;Karl opens up a lot by spending time with this good ol' family.
896;sling Blade is a very good movie with a very good story to it.
897;I really enjoyed this movie.
898;This movie is defiantely one of my favorite movies of all time.
899;This is flat out one of the best films to come along in years.
900;The relationships of all of the characters is amazing.
901;The one that stands out is obviously with Carl and Frank (the young boy).
902;And also Carl has a unique relationship with Vaughn (John Ritter) and it is actually quite comical although not deep.
903;I caught myself laughing a lot at just how real this character was.
904;One of the great parts of this movie is when dominating Doyle almost forces his friends come over and play music on the front lawn and then screams at them all for not doing it all his way and wanting to leave and then kicks them out.
905;It was well acted, directed and just a great film.
906;First of all, this film features Billy Bob Thornton at his absolute best.
907;phenomenal writing, admirable directing, and flawless acting.
908;Secondly, this profound and powerful film brings tears to my eyes even now, weeks later.
909;it's strong on its own.
910;John Ritter beautifully brings to life a warm, loving, stable gay character, and that, in my book, only adds to the film's far.
911;The surprise performance: Dwight Yoakam's portrayal of the drunken, abusive Doyle.
912;Great cut of this film.
913;One of my personal favorite films.
914;The moral dilemma that ensues comes forth at a beautiful pace, lodging Karl's character in our hearts and winning our rapt attention for the length of this engrossing film.
915;Couple that with some stupendous performances and it's a no.
916;Sling Blade is a fantastic movie that you'll never forget.
917;Billy Bob was not yet a household name at the time, so he was a relatively unheard of man who created this deeply moving portrait of a simple man with a big heart, logical thinking and a horrible past.
918;Equally as great in this movie was Lucas Black, the young boy he befriends.
919;Black has a wonderful Southern accent, (which I'm glad he has not been coached out of even today) and a very natural screen presence.
920;He's great in this as the local gay shopkeeper who is protective and empathetic to the Lucas Black and his mother characters.
921;wrenching, full of love and horror, frindship, loyalty, surprise, reality and fantastic acting.
922;Billy Bob Thornton proved early on, in this film, that he's a genius and the finest actor alive.
923;I don't know where the idea for the story came from, but it could well be a true story as it seems so real.
924;but as each scene comes and goes, you realize that there is a lot more going on inside Karl's head than anyone else believes.
925;he returns to his childhood hometown after being released from the hospital and puts his mechanical skills to good use as a small engine wiz at a local mechanic shop.
926;small town folks have big hearts, but sometimes small minds.
927;Frank's mother (Natalie Camerday) has a best friend who is gay (well acted by John Ritter) and he must hide his relationships from the townsfolk.
928;Her friend Vaughn wants to go to a a bigger city with wider acceptance of his lifestyle, but he continues to stay to act as a guardian angel for his friend and her son.
929;as Karl meets and interacts with the new friends (and enemies) he meets, he reveals some of his darker secrets with his friend, Frank.
930;He not only feels great pain of what he has experienced and what he has done, he feels great empathy for Frank and his mother and holds their friendship dear to his heart.
931;this film really makes you think .
932;Outstanding performances wonderful slow paced story.
933;I enjoyed this movie because the characters were so believable.
934;The movie is well acted and has a good plot to the story.
935;This classic would've gotten 5 stars, but hearing the late great J. t. Walsh use the phrase ''uncircumcized penis'' made me puke up my french fried taters with mustard.
936;l thought John Ritter's character was really funny.
937;Not funny as in queer, funny as in ha.
938;His screenplay was given a well deserved Oscar.
939;But this movie was really an outstanding achievement in acting portrayal.
940;He shines as the mentally retarded man who befriends a boy he shares a house with.
941;Country Singer Dwight Yoakam is incredibly good as the boy's abusive step father.
942;And John Ritter is great in a non.
943;It's a moving drama that I thought was one of the best films of 1998.
944;Billy Bob Thorntion is great in this movie!
945;He did an amazing job!
946;A wonderful movie, all engrossing and thought provoking.
947;There isn't too much that can be said other than this is a great movie .
948;One of Billy Bob's best performances.
949;Heart touching in some scenes movie was well written
950;This movie is so totally awesome.
951;It is worth the money I paid for it.
952;It arrived in very good condition.
953;Billy Bob Thornton does an excellent job writing, directing and starring in this movie.
954;The way that Thornton explains the childhood of Carl in the beginning of the movie gives the audience a good picture of what he has been through.
955;Yokam and Ritter also do excellent jobs in their roles.
956;Toward the end of the movie you can predict what is going to happen by the turn of events that take place.
957;He goes to all of the people who have been straight with him and asked them of favors.
958;I would rate this movie a four out of five and would watch it again due to its incredible acting and excellent screenplay.
959;I must say, it was a really good movie.
960;Great movie bought used but everyhting in it looked like new.
961;Watch this movie and bring tissues with you.
962;This is a movie I have always wanted to see.
963;This is an excellent movie!
964;You will fall in love with the character, and the story as well.
965;Everyone should see this Southern Gothic moral tale.
966;there are two version of this move: Sling Blade and Some Folks Call it A Sling Blade.
967;If you can only see one, see the former"
968;The simple Childers elicits waves of sympathy from the viewer.
969;Molly Ringwald is great as one of the girls reporter.
970;Superb actors animate believable characters to tell a simple, moral story that is chock full of imagery from Christianity and Greek mythology.
971;Sling Blade is one of those brilliant films that has a lasting impact for generation's to come.
972;A wonderful story of redemption and self.
973;A fine supporting cast (including the late John Ritter, Country Superstar Dwight Yoakam, and a cameo appearence by the legendary Robert Duvall) and amazing cinematography are just some of the highlights of this amazing film!
974;The acting was terrific and the music is great.
975;Billy Bob Thorton does an excellent job as the retarded man.
976;I especially loved the scene towards the end when Karl and the boy, Frank, are sitting on a stump at the boy's secret spot near a pond.
977;Karl has come to love the boy and knows he won't be seeing him anymore because of what he is about to do (I won't tell).
978;There are other great scenes too, but this one I watch over and over.
979;Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
980;Suddenly, the general public discovered for itself the talented actor who had never previously been able to penetrate the mainstream consciousness.
981;Karl eventually decides that he wants to set matters right after observing the cruelty imposed on Frank and his mother.
982;the week is Thornton's performance.
983;telling so the entire film has a general feeling of seen.
984;off primarily because the acting is solid.
985;second time I viewed this film and liked it more than ever.
986;Acting was superb and the touching storyline kept the whole family engrossed to the very end.
987;A classic film about mental illness.
988;inducing line about the small boy living in his own heart, a strange lapse in such an intelligent film.
989;that being said, this film really sticks with you and easily overcomes the flaws.
990;Thornton completely transforms himself in an astonishing performance.
991;he does it through sheer force of will.
992;The boy is engaging and utterly believable.
993;but my real love for this movie comes from the language.
994;Perhaps you have to come from a rural area to truly appreciate it, but the dialogue is laugh.
995;To me, the lines, and they way they were delivered, made every sentence in this film a gem.
996;I believe I could simply listen to this movie and enjoy it without every seeing a frame.
997;An moving account of friendship and vengeance.
998;Disturbing in its ending yet deeply moving and touching in the buildup.
999;Awesome movie, had a great story and Billy Bob Thornton is such a wonderful actor.
1000;i loved it, highly recommended +++++++
1001;I found it on Ebay and the seller actually had it to be before the actual delivery date.
1002;This is one of the best movies by Billy Bob Thornton and I recommend highly.
1003;disc collector's edition with special features which some sell for much more.
1004;It's a ground breaking, wonderful film.
1005;Superb acting, good directing and an equally well.
1006;written script make this movie a must see for every movie buff.
1007;I especially loved the performance of Lucas Black, the young actor in the film that befriends Thornton's character.
1008;When you see it, you'll know what part I was referring to.
1009;It was powerful for me and I believed him.
1010;And that is one of many parts of the film that resonated with me and rang true and believable.
1011;The acting awesome in a movie shows human emotions in all forms fromhappiness to sadness with some humor thrown in.
1012;based on all the compelling one star reviews, I wanted to vote too.
1013;OK i already knew this was the greatest movie of all time but i bought it used and it came in perfect condition ,and i got it for 5 bucks including shipping, this was most definetly a steal.
1014;I received this in excellent condition.
1015;I will never forget the superb acting in this movie.
1016;Billy Bob is a true genius.
1017;Yes, the storyline was rather thin, but it somehow reflected the mind of Karl, from who's standpoint we view the film.
1018;Furthermore, much of the credit should go to the fact that Thornton tackled a sensitive issue, which gives any film a social relevance.
1019;I thought many reviewers spoke about the film as an evening entertainment that somehow didn't work for them (which is fine with me).
1020;I love the movie never gets old.
1021;New and cheaper than anything I have found in the stores.
1022;If your a Billy Bob fan this one is his best.
1023;Not sure if that was appropriate, but we both loved the movie and ended up getting married (unrelated).
1024;billy Bob Thorton did a fantastic job in front of and behind the camera on this movie.
1025;This is a great honest real life type movie.
1026;Kind of grim but touching.
1027;This is a wonderful film, and not what you would expect from the title.
1028;The character of Carl is so finely tuned and so honest, it stays with you from the second you see him.You won't ever forget him.
1029;I admit I enjoy the scenes with Frankie the most.
1030;All the performances,however, are beautifully realized.
1031;Every nuance in this movie is sublime.
1032;Thornton assembles stunning cinematography, a menacing and melancholy soundtrack, flawless scripting, his own deft direction and stunning performances (who would've thought Dwight Yoakam could act?)
1033;to create a true masterpiece of horror, tragedy and redemption.
1034;Billy Bob and the entire cast really laid out excellent performances.
1035;It is also sad in places but I found It very easy to relate to
1036;This is a wonderful movie and I have been looking for it for several years and it is very hard to find!
1037;well, my narrative comes mostly from the Christian perspective.
1038;Also, the movie is full of Christian overtones since Karl appears to be a very strong believer in God.
1039;"the actor performances were terrific
1040;Good Lord was this an over.
1041;I mean it's OK, but COME ON!
1042;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1043;my son kept saying, Just watch the film.
1044;sling Blade has become on of my very favorite films.
1045;I have watched it numerous times and catch myself saying, Bless his heart.
1046;one of the best movies i have ever watched.
1047;everyone did a fantastic job.
1048;I realize this is an old movie but it's the best I've seen in a very long time.
1049;How anyone writes, directs and acts in a story such as this, is amazing.
1050;billy bob is awesome in this movie.
1051;Billy Bob Thornton was one of the best in this movie.
1052;He truly met the part without words that make him one of the best in the movie industry.
1053;Considering everyone on the planet has seen it by now and loved it, Id sat its at least triple that figure.
1054;An excellent story with a cast that couldnt be better (Ritter rules!)
1055;, this is definitely worth a Friday night watch.
1056;I absolutely love this movie.
1057;Billy Bob Thornton is amazing as Carl.
