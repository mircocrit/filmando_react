I:9509;1;If you can't understand his thinking and way if directing you will never be able to really enjoy his movies.
I:9509;2;The movie itself is great!
I:9509;3;Widescreen is meant for films with sweeping landscapes, not art films that take place primarily in one room.
I:9509;4;The pristine remastering makes little sense, since faded color and pops and scratches actually enhance the 70s vibe of this film.
I:9509;5;I have recommended this movie to several people.
I:9509;6;It's a classic honor and betrayal among thieves theme, but in a contemporary setting.
I:9509;7;I saw this movie before Pulp Fiction came out and I still prefer it to PF.
I:9509;8;RD is hilarious at many points, but tragic also.
I:9509;9;There are characters you feel for.
I:9509;10;This movie has everything a great film should have.
I:9509;11;This movie, together with Pulp Fiction, is fantastic.
I:9509;12;Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn are equally effective in their roles.
I:9509;13;Even the voice of Stephen Wright as the radio DJ is perfect.
I:9509;14;It's hard to believe that a debut film by an unknown (at the time) director could pack this much wallop and star power.
I:9509;15;'Pulp Fiction' is a great film but it still can't match this one for sheer power and energy.
I:9509;16;Two formats, great sound, and extra goodies makes it a worthwhile addition to your collection.
I:9509;17;If you like Pulp Fiction, or even if you didn't, you will love Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;18;The dialogue is brilliant, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Quentin Tarantino and Mike Madsen all do great!!!
I:9509;19;As they say, simpler is better.
I:9509;20;the acting was definitely top.
I:9509;21;notch, with Harvey Keitel (one of my favorite actors), Steve Buscemi, and Tim Roth (doing an extremely credible American accent) in the roles of their careers.
I:9509;22;The best performance, though, was Michael Madsen, who is brilliant as the reprehensible Mr. Blonde.
I:9509;23;however, RD is otherwise a great film.
I:9509;24;It's very realistic and Tarantino doesn't spare anything, reflecting exactly what violent death in the real world is like.
I:9509;25;This edition is definitely worth the money, and is far better than the way it is presented on Spike TV.
I:9509;26;Reservoir Dogs is an action movie made up of words, a sophisticated shoot.
I:9509;27;"the movie opens with a conversation of the seven criminals
I:9509;28;One dynamic character, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), appears to be the funny, cool, collected one from his jokes and sense of humor.
I:9509;29;after the opening it goes straight to the aftermath of the heist, and the battles between criminals about who did what, and why the job was botched, are intense.
I:9509;30;It is a rare Hollywood film that takes its time to tell a story, with poignant dialogue and characters, but also attracts the masses with its stunning violence and acting.
I:9509;31;This movie is so good that I would recommend it for anyone who isn't faint at the sight of blood.
I:9509;32;The characters are full of depth, and the plot is so simple yet so wonderfully portrayed from start to finish.
I:9509;33;An original film that portrays the lead up and consequences of a heist by several larger than life criminals on a collision course.
I:9509;34;Superb cast and great performances.
I:9509;35;the script is also excellent, and Tarantino often employs the flashback style of editing that Kurosawa pioneered in Rashomon.
I:9509;36;The R2 is only in 2.0 stereo, but has a superb (and I mean *outstanding*) anamorphic transfer.
I:9509;37;The extras are all personalized and funny.
I:9509;38;Interviews with the cast and director, a review of the year in independant cinema breakthrough, Sundance film festival reviews of the directors and their films.
I:9509;39;Critics at the festival who offer their view on the film, scene specific commentary from various people involved in the production, a dedication to various influences on the film by Tarantino, and much, much more.
I:9509;40;My favorite thing was to listen to the raw audio tracks of Stephen Wright recording his DJ work with Quentin, hilarious.
I:9509;41;The film is now considered a masterpiece of unique proportions and yet it also talks about certain things in it that might have derailed that success if the public hadn't been open to them, such as the violence.
I:9509;42;Overall, a great presentation of a very influential and seminal film.
I:9509;43;If you love American independant cinema you awe it to yourself to check out this inexpensively priced gem.
I:9509;44;You will love to watch it over and over again.
I:9509;45;"So much for families, God and ""peace on earth""."
I:9509;46;I'm a huge Tarantino fan and this is one of his best.
I:9509;47;His dialogue is superbly pulled off by the incredible acting that is brought by this cast.
I:9509;48;Along with that there is the unique non.
I:9509;49;Classic movie, a must own.
I:9509;50;Great soundtrack with memorable characters that provide an excellent story that is both violent and entertaining.
I:9509;51;Still engrossing and gross after all these years.
I:9509;52;this movie is not for the faint of heart but the story is stil strong.
I:9509;53;One of my favorite scenes is in the diner discussing Madonna's music.
I:9509;54;This is one of my favorite movies ever, it has such a great plot and the characters are developed so well.
I:9509;55;Great movie, I had never seen it before.
I:9509;56;It is a must see .
I:9509;57;Great price for the anniversary edition as well.
I:9509;58;Loved the movie and the characters.
I:9509;59;I figured it was about time I got around to seeing this, to see what all the fuss was about.
I:9509;60;But this movie is frequently held up as some sort of masterpiece, and frankly.
I:9509;61;That's all I've got to say about this screen gem!
I:9509;62;It is a classic mob movie and it is what put all those involved (Save Keitel) on the map of worldwide audiences.
I:9509;63;"tarantino was well on his way after this film
I:9509;64;it can be said that Tarantino is the master of dialogue and conversation.
I:9509;65;He writes better and more realistically than any screenwiter I've ever seen or read.
I:9509;66;i liked this movie because it was not predictable.
I:9509;67;star review and the 609th overall review.
I:9509;68;"Marco Freire is definitely a very good example of how the effect works 
I:9509;69;One of my favorite films, and definitely Tarantino's finest (I love `Pulp Fiction' but in all seriousness I just like this one better), `Reservoir Dogs' is a landmark in modern cinema.
I:9509;70;"there you have it
I:9509;71;Tarantino masterfully uses his humor, his values and his visual stylings to bring us a gangster flick that is superior to most all other gangster flicks.
I:9509;72;When these men are faced with the possibility of a rat within their midst we begin to see their true colors.
I:9509;73;There is a certain code of honor that swallows these criminals whole, and then that code is broken they start to unravel one by one.
I:9509;74;the film hinges strongly on the performances by the ensemble cast, most notably that of Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth.
I:9509;75;Michael Madsen is effortlessly collected as the ruthless killer Mr. Blonde.
I:9509;76;Steve Buscemi (who won the Independent Spirit Award for this performance) is marvelously on edge throughout the entire film.
I:9509;77;It's a brilliant performance, one that is eye.
I:9509;78;in an ensemble piece with no clear leading actor, Keitel ultimately dominates the audience's attention with his marvelous portrayal of Mr. White.
I:9509;79;His dedication and loyalty to his partners, especially to that of the dying Mr. Orange is noteworthy and moving.
I:9509;80;percent to deliver a rich and commanding performance.
I:9509;81;quinton Tarantino is a brilliant director, we all know this.
I:9509;82;As White, Orange, Brown, Blue, Blonde and Pink sit at a diner with Joe, the man responsible for setting up this rendezvous, and Eddie (Joe's son), they discuss the meaning behind Madonna's classic `Like a Virgin' and the end result is one of the most entertaining scenes in Hollywood history, and a scene done so efficiently and so masterfully that it alone should have garnered Tarantino a directing Oscar.
I:9509;83;from his smash hit `Pulp Fiction' to his stunning follow up `Jackie Brown' to his marvelous `one.
I:9509;84;punch' that is `Kill Bill', Tarantino is always on point and ahead of his game.
I:9509;85;`Reservoir Dogs' marks the beginning of his illustrious career, and honestly, it is the best thing he's ever done.
I:9509;86;You see, Quentin Tarantino movies are pretty good.
I:9509;87;This is a great movie!
I:9509;88;The acting and direction is superb and the characters are realistic, even seeming like ordinary people off the street.
I:9509;89;Tarantino's music choices reflect his unique style and are a great addition to the film as well.
I:9509;90;"I returned both movies, paid postage, insurance, and delivery confirmation
I:9509;91;the Following refers just to the 10th anniversary version:The special features are really worth it, unbelievable how close this movie wouldn't see daylight and we would never had heard of anyone named Quentin Tarantino!
I:9509;92;The delivery was great and the service great, however we are unable to play the disc.
I:9509;93;This is one of my more favorite films of all time.
I:9509;94;I'm slightly hearing impaired and I often like to have these available even on English language films.
I:9509;95;A small beef, but those of us with less than adequate hearing appreciate this feature.
I:9509;96;"When ""Reservoir Dogs"" was released 13 years ago, it was almost instantly hailed as a masterpiece and its director, an ex."
I:9509;97;but looking pas these minor flaws you will find a great movie.
I:9509;98;A great cast was assembled for this film.
I:9509;99;Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are the standout performers, but the rest of the cast is excellent.
I:9509;100;Michael Madsen is awesome in his role.
I:9509;101;The late Lawrence Tierney is fatastic as Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is wonderful as Nice Guy Eddie.
I:9509;102;Even Quentin joins in on the fun as Mr. Brown.
I:9509;103;"Overall, ""Reservior Dogs"" isn't exactly the masterpiece everyone thinks it is, but it is still a darn good film."
I:9509;104;Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs in what may be the greatest film debut ever.
I:9509;105;"The script is dazzling, funny and viciously sarcastic
I:9509;106;This is one of my ten best films, a great ride.
I:9509;107;All the action takes place practically in one room and all the characters are dressed in black and look the same at first instant.
I:9509;108;What's so special about this movie?
I:9509;109;It's just the way it is.
I:9509;110;edition got brilliant bonus features.
I:9509;111;I loved this product so much that I later on bought the Kill Bill Blu.
I:9509;112;This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.
I:9509;113;It has Tarantino's trademark of mixing the story up and creating a very good movie.
I:9509;114;This is without a doubt the best movie i have seen.
I:9509;115;It is simply a joy to watch.
I:9509;116;the opening sequence is hilarious, but really establishes this for what it is.
I:9509;117;That being an honest film.
I:9509;118;, well yes u are right.
I:9509;119;gangsters dont just sit around shining their bullets, talking about murders, and that is what is so great about this film, it shows us the human side to everything.
I:9509;120;it is not about the robbery , its about the characters,and as this marvel of a film unveils it gets better and more entertaining as the facts are revieled to us.
I:9509;121;Reservoir Dogs is a classic.
I:9509;122;Quentin Tarantino sure knows how to write and direct a movie.
I:9509;123;I had a high exception for this film since it was recommended to me and of course, it was one of Quentin's films.
I:9509;124;I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters in this movie.
I:9509;125;are equally as good in their acting.
I:9509;126;i find it ironic that a lot of my favorite movies have a plotline in which they are robbing something and coincidently it probably happens to be diamonds.
I:9509;127;I could basically predict each character's move after watching the first scene.
I:9509;128;I would recommend Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels way over this movie.
I:9509;129;Reservoir Dogs is my favorite movie of all time, and I got the best version of it for a low price.
I:9509;130;Expectations from others placed on Quentin Tarantino were so high that he had to top Reservoir Dogs in the next film, and he did.
I:9509;131;Reservoir Dogs may boast of having the strongest introduction ever because it's that good.
I:9509;132;All of the performances were equal and of superior kind.
I:9509;133;That's a brilliant work of a director.
I:9509;134;The aftermath after the fiasco was much more interesting and set the tone for the entire picture while at the same time the beforehand knowledge of the characters became the more the merrier.
I:9509;135;Perhaps the most memorable character out of Reservoir Dogs was the psychopath Mr. Blonde played well by, ironically, the black.
I:9509;136;The story is as clever as it gets, and the random moments are all connected together.
I:9509;137;It's a great piece of work where Quentin stole ideas from so many films and incorporated them into his own film, and the result is quite good.
I:9509;138;He is real good in his performance.
I:9509;139;The rest of everybody else is decent.
I:9509;140;Of course, there is a lot of moments in the film, making it a very watchable picture.
I:9509;141;The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch.
I:9509;142;when films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions.
I:9509;143;It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.
I:9509;144;the ear scene alone makes this movie great.
I:9509;145;get it, got it, see it!
I:9509;146;The film is most enjoyable and a MUST teaching tool for film schools.
I:9509;147;This is precisely what we want to tell students how they can make great films with bare minimum resources and lots of creativity.
I:9509;148;There was no big budget for grand sets, costumes, pretty girls and handsome faces but the right mix of creativity, talents, a fine script, the strong performance of the right cast and crew delivers miracles!!
I:9509;149;"The Tarantino phenomenon begins with ""Reservoir Dogs"", the film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino which won him worldwide acclaim and gave him his first break."
I:9509;150;this 1991 film is about six perfect strangers with colour.
I:9509;151;coded aliases (Mr Orange, Mr White, Mr Blonde, Mr Pink, Mr Brown and Mr Blue) pulling off a simple heist.
I:9509;152;The story ends with the most moving and unexpected twist despite all the typical Tarantino blood, gore and violence.
I:9509;153;eight to eighty years old are fascinated by the riveting story and moved by the unlikely friendship developed between Mr Orange/Tim Roth and Mr White/Harvey Keitel.
I:9509;154;"hacking scene accompanied by Stealers Wheel's delightful ""Stuck In the Middle With You""."
I:9509;155;Quentin Tarrintino is an amazing talent when it comes to making movies, and ALL of his movies are greatbut this (His first) is my favorite.
I:9509;156;His style is so hip and unique, and the characters always unforgettable!Reservoir Dogs is basically the story of a jewel heist gone wrong.
I:9509;157;"the funny part about it is the discussion taking place at the table, about Madonna's song ""Like a virgin""."
I:9509;158;coded named criminals (the boss gave them the names because they don't know each each other, and boss wants to keep it that way)We have Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink (my fave)What is interesting about this is, that after they leave the restaurant, we immediately flash to a car with Mr. White driving and Orange in the back .
I:9509;159;there are many editions of this movie out, but the 15th anniversary edition is really PACKED with extras, and the packaging is cool too.
I:9509;160;It really is a cool edition to own, even if you own the 10th anniversary, or other editions.
I:9509;161;once of the greatest movies of all time!
I:9509;162;I've been studying movies for over a decade now and believe me when I say this that Tarantino is possibly one of the best or possibly the best director I have ever scene.
I:9509;163;Reservoir Dogs makes you feel like you actually know each of these criminals one by one.
I:9509;164;now not seeing the movie may make you think I'm a little disturbed when I say this but the graphic violence and the ultra graphic language is part of why this movie is so great.
I:9509;165;It brings you into the atmosphere, I mean criminals actually act and talk like that.
I:9509;166;The acting of the convicts are so superb, Keitel and Busecmi (Did I spell that right?)
I:9509;167;A classic, and every connoisseur of modern film should own it.
I:9509;168;Tarantino's best film so far, 'Reservoir Dogs' has the human comedy of 'Pulp Fiction' without the contrived coolness of the later film.
I:9509;169;The characters are superb, and it's enthralling to watch the friendship between Mr. Orange and Mr. White develop throughout the film.
I:9509;170;"Mr. Blonde is Michael Madsen's best role to date, and he comes across as a genuine psycho
I:9509;171;Structurally, this film is great at demonstrating how bits of restaurant conversation are made manifest in the later actions of its characters.
I:9509;172;When all the blood has coagulated and all the shouting is over you'll feel blessed relief.
I:9509;173;I suspect a lot of us would like to see him try.
I:9509;174;This ranks right up there with Super Troopers (which I actually mailed to someone .
I:9509;175;mind you this movie is 15 years old!
I:9509;176;An excellent film about a heist gone bad.
I:9509;177;Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and the rest are perfect.
I:9509;178;Michael Madsen's part was perhaps the most memorable.
I:9509;179;I also bought numerous others at the same time.
I:9509;180;I know I will catch hell for this from diehard Pulp Fiction fans, but this is Tarantino's best movie, in my opinion.
I:9509;181;I can understand why they would feel this way, because I feel like those films are equals, in many ways: both really have no plot, both have great dialogue, and both are very low budget.
I:9509;182;Reservoir Dogs is the same way: an old story made new and exciting by an enthusiastic new director (he was at the time of this movie) and a brilliant cast.
I:9509;183;that being said, we can move on to the movie.
I:9509;184;existent original plot by way of a terrific script (the opening diner scene is a classic example).
I:9509;185;Also worth mentioning are the conversations during the flashbacks of Mr. Orange.
I:9509;186;Strong performances are another plus: everyone in this film is flawless and well suited, even Tarantino himself in a brief, but memorable roll.
I:9509;187;"directors, Tarantino knows his limits and stays within them
I:9509;188;But his part in this movie is very good, albeit very short.
I:9509;189;He is absolutely fantastic in this movie.
I:9509;190;Great performances are also turned in by Michael Madsen and Tim Roth.
I:9509;191;guy self, but puts a spin on it by being a psychopath (and a very funny one, in a deadpan sort of way).
I:9509;192;As such, it is great fun to watch him because you don't exactly know what will he will do next.
I:9509;193;"Tim Roth is an actor that I think should be getting ALOT more attention these days because he is truly fantastic here (as he was in his brief role in Pulp Fiction
I:9509;194;He is incredible as Mr. Orange who, while spending alot of the movie bleeding, is torn between a horrible situation that he can't control.
I:9509;195;While he often plays the same type of character, he is incredible in this movie because he balances a cold.
I:9509;196;budget look to the film is a complement to the story's gritty look at honor between thieves.
I:9509;197;The wonderful period music from that time is used extremely well.
I:9509;198;Tarantino has a true knack for that, which was later made famous by Pulp Fiction's great surf soundtrack.
I:9509;199;The scenes are all well shot and directed.
I:9509;200;that being said, in short,: great movie.
I:9509;201;It manages to keep its secrets and its suspense going until the end and was very entertaining in between.
I:9509;202;This movie does not contain that much action but the dialogue is great and holds well.
I:9509;203;This film is a must have for Tarantino fans everywhere and a definte must see for anyone looking for a film that makes you assume the roles and actions but makes you keep on guessing the whole time!
I:9509;204;This film is Tarantino's debut as a feature film writer/director.
I:9509;205;Some people don't care for Tarantino's penchant for this cinema style but it is what he is, and so there you are.
I:9509;206;if you can handle (or enjoy, as I do) Tarantino's style, and also the violence, this is a great movie .
I:9509;207;well told, great acting, beautifully shot and edited.
I:9509;208;great visual resolution, detail and color, and an outstanding audio soundtrack.
I:9509;209;but he's made a few damn good movies.
I:9509;210;It's an admittedly gossipy, but intelligent non.
I:9509;211;And it does cause one to pause and re.
I:9509;212;evaluate his work to some degree, from a new and more critical angle.
I:9509;213;Hamsher's account of things is a bit subjective, but definitely an entertaining and recommendable read for those interested in Tarantino, Oliver Stone, or moviemaking in general.
I:9509;214;I think his characters are strong, developed, and full of subtlety (even though the overall style is starkly bombastic.)
I:9509;215;on who the characters are and what they are each personally feeling at each given moment.
I:9509;216;* And the situations that comprise that which is *happening* are in and of themselves very nuanced and complex.
I:9509;217;As for the characters, they are certainly once.
I:9509;218;the performances in Tarantino's movies so far have been universally excellent.)
I:9509;219;And since this is a fictional movie .
I:9509;220;If it's sometimes disturbing, well good .
I:9509;221;The majority of us are mature enough to be able to make the distinction between fantasy and reality.
I:9509;222;Movies are, to my mind, aesthetic creations.
I:9509;223;though perhaps less than thrilled with Tarantino himself, Reservoir Dogs remains a startling, confident, aesthetic, inventive, and impacting creation.
I:9509;224;The script here is fabulous, and of course, everything that's been said about the great cast and directing is all true.
I:9509;225;And the coffee shop scenes, of course, resurfaced in Pulp Fiction and many more following movies.
I:9509;226;Madson creates one of Cinemas Greatest Psychopaths, Cool, Calculating and Crazy.
I:9509;227;the Story is obviously Simplistic, and has been done to death over the years, but Quentin makes it, and the whole genre, Utterly Fresh, Real and Unbelievably Entertaining.
I:9509;228;quentin's Writing and Directing seem to have Years of Experience behind them, while also having the freshness and youth of a Debut writer/director.
I:9509;229;This for me was a great film and would of made five stars, The reason i gave it four stars is because the twist it had quite fusstrated me but still a good twist.
I:9509;230;This movie is top class tarantino stuff and has some pure quilty parts in the movie.
I:9509;231;but a great film (one copy is enough though)
I:9509;232;Great flick that keeps you watching the entire time.
I:9509;233;Starts off great and ends even better.
I:9509;234;This is the greatest crime film ever made.
I:9509;235;From the opening diner scene to the gripping end in the deserted warehouse, this film is action packed.
I:9509;236;The dialogue is amazing, it fits the criminals like a glove.
I:9509;237;Steve Buscemi puts in his best performance until Fargo, as the always nervous Mr. Pink.
I:9509;238;Tarantino blends these interesting characters together beautifully.
I:9509;239;This is his best work.
I:9509;240;Harvey Keitel is also amazing, as is Michael Madsen as a psychotic Mr. Blonde.
I:9509;241;The highlight however, is Tim Roth's performance.
I:9509;242;As Mr. Orange, this is his breakthrough role.
I:9509;243;The interesting flashbacks make the movie somewhat hard to follow, but with a second viewing, it all comes together.
I:9509;244;Before Quentin Tarantino made Pulp Fiction and became the most overhyped filmmaker on the planet (THREE movies in TEN years, please!)
I:9509;245;he made his ambitious low budget directorial debut with help from Harvey Kietel and one of the best casts ever assembled for a crime picture.
I:9509;246;The screenplay is brilliant, full of snappy dialog and witty reparte.
I:9509;247;The action is quick and bloody and the ending is a classic.
I:9509;248;overall, along with Pulp Fiction this is one of the best crime films ever made.
I:9509;249;"time filmmakers,"" Quentin Tarantino scores a solid 5."
I:9509;250;Having heard many times how worthy this film is, I decided to give it a go anyway.
I:9509;251;For one thing, if one can peek past all the four.
I:9509;252;letter words, the dialogue is truly excellent.
I:9509;253;And, of course, taking into account that this is a world of seedy small.
I:9509;254;The words Tarantino gives his characters are as real as you'd expect from any group of overgrown juvenile delinquents, often funny, sometimes unwittingly insightful in character development, and always revealing what a bunch of idiots these saps are.
I:9509;255;"Those three levels to the dialogue are all on full display when Tarantino himself delivers an opening monologue about the real meaning of Madonna's music, especially ""Like a Virgin,"" and it's a theme that runs through the entire film."
I:9509;256;it's a very thoughtful film and very, very well made, especially considering its microscopic budget.
I:9509;257;First off, the entire movie is just brilliant.
I:9509;258;The movie operates on many levels and succeeds on all.
I:9509;259;The soundtrack of oldies but goodies throughout this intelligent, but tense, whodunit entertains on its own level, and seems surrealistic at times as it rides herd on some of the most graphic violence ever put on film.
I:9509;260;edge dialog and menace from the men is brilliant on another level.
I:9509;261;All of this and more, either individually or collectively, would recommend the movie, but the most brilliant scene of the movie takes place at the very first, even before the credits role, while this group of seven men are having breakfast in a diner.
I:9509;262;This alone is brilliant: I mean, how often do you imagine that seven, white, middle.
I:9509;263;I won't go into the various pro and con responses, but I tell you true, you will not ever hear a more enjoyable and thought.
I:9509;264;Good Price for a Blue Ray.
I:9509;265;I bought this for a Christmas gift and It was below my spending limit so I bought another one.
I:9509;266;written, directed, and acted film is about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of each man's suspicions.
I:9509;267;Harvey Keitel is wonderful as tough but compassionate Mr. White(Each man is given an alias name, no one's real name is used), Michael Madsen is cool and psychotic as Mr. Blonde, Sean Penn delivers a strong performance as Nice.
I:9509;268;The really great performances definitely go to Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi.
I:9509;269;For Roth(Mr. Orange), this was a breakthrough role in which he spends a good deal of the movie drenched in his own blood and in his screams of pain never once goes into an over.
I:9509;270;It's right on the money.
I:9509;271;Buscemi is dripping with attitude and gives one of his best performances until FARGO in RESERVOIR DOGS.
I:9509;272;see for anyone who enjoys lotsa suspense, catchy dialogue and music, and some great action scenes.
I:9509;273;Hands down, my favorite movie.
I:9509;274;There is just something so cinematically beautiful about this movie that speaks worlds to me.
I:9509;275;Great direction by Quentin Tarantino, great acting by Steve Busemi and Harvey Kietel, and unrelentless violence make this film a masterpiece to many and hated by some.
I:9509;276;It's a classic and is definately some of the best work Tarantino has ever done.
I:9509;277;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:9509;278;The action, the story line, the ending, the SOUNDTRACK, gees, how much greater could this movie get?
I:9509;279;You must be a Tarantino type of person to truly appreciate this flick.
I:9509;280;The guys who made this movie were having so much fun that I stopped listening to the commentary when an actor complained about sweating.
I:9509;281;Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino at his finest.
I:9509;282;Watching this movie you can see what makes Tarantino so stylistically great.
I:9509;283;The music, dialogue, camera work and visual style all hint at what he will become.
I:9509;284;The story is great, and is probably my favorite of his after Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;285;If you're a fan of Tarantino, or crime flicks, you should enjoy Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;286;If you like Tarantino, you will love this movie.
I:9509;287;Action packed, violent, and funny in places.
I:9509;288;The opening dialog is fun but I had to really crank the volume to hear it.
I:9509;289;The video is very good.
I:9509;290;This is Tarantino's first film and it was one of the best movies of the year, and the Academy awards and Siskel and Ebert should both be caned by a group spitfire Asians for snubbing it.
I:9509;291;The characters are all extremely likable, even crazy sadist, Mr. Blonde, and the dialogue is hilarious.
I:9509;292;I'm the type who watches the extras once so I was happy to pass my 10th anniversary edition to a friend and replace it with this one.
I:9509;293;Nice, plausible twist at the end.
I:9509;294;constructed modern movies I've seen in recent memory.
I:9509;295;If you already own it, watch it again!
I:9509;296;Once you understand how he tells a story you begin to appreciate how he lays out the background, pulls detailed characterizations from the actors, and integrates the music to emphasize the mood.
I:9509;297;The story is good, the cast excellent, and the directing superb.
I:9509;298;got this for my bro in law for an xmas gift and he was thrilled to have it in his hands!
I:9509;299;Not only was the packaging unique and hip.
I:9509;300;I gave this as a gift and it was received with a huge smile.
I:9509;301;"Reservoir Dogs served notice that a new auteur was on the scene, but though a good first effort for Quentin Tarantino, it was just a taste of things to come
I:9509;302;it seemed very fresh and original at the time, but it may be getting a bit stale now, past its sell.
I:9509;303;Back in 1993 when this movie come first out, I can clearly remember my first impressions.
I:9509;304;It's a brilliant opening sequence .
I:9509;305;It was witty, engaging but above all original and the rest of the movie follows in a similar style.
I:9509;306;The humour, the tension, the gritty action and many complex subtleties make this movie truly one of the greatest thrillers of all time.
I:9509;307;Also, the extras are a must.
I:9509;308;Best of this is the review of the movie by various people.
I:9509;309;All the people interviewed are all big fans and their views are all right on the button, pointing out details of the film you make not have picked up when watching.
I:9509;310;These people all love this movie, and are enthusiastic for it and in their interviews are (possibly) more articulate that your average filmgoer.
I:9509;311;hit wonders whose quirkiness has the audience smirking with each opening notes, and secondly how each song selection fits with the story without being the same as the story.
I:9509;312;but in terms of intelligent thrillers this one set the grade and will surely be regarded as a classic for years to come.
I:9509;313;The entire cast gives wonderful performances, making the film seem very realistic.
I:9509;314;Quentin Tarantino's dialogue flows crisp and smooth through the whole film.
I:9509;315;Sadistic violence and long bloody scenes make this film powerful and worthy to be called cinema.
I:9509;316;I hope you enjoy this film!
I:9509;317;As I'm sure you know, this is an amazing film that is still influencing films of today.
I:9509;318;ray] and what I received is Of Gods and Men (Two.
I:9509;319;The cast speaks for itself and you can see throughout the film they really had a great time making it!
I:9509;320;i also liked it how the director did the flashbacks, showing all the scenes leading up to the crime, showing how all these strangers came together to perform one perfect crime, only to have one of them screw it all up for everyone.
I:9509;321;For example, when Mr. Pink started making a big fuss that he got Pink for his color as his code name.
I:9509;322;It has crime, mystery, and a nice plot.
I:9509;323;Infused with clever dialogue, this is one of my favorite Tarantino films, alongside Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;324;The guy is a genius and he has the greatest presentation method going these days.
I:9509;325;Superb cast, brilliant writing and directing.
I:9509;326;This was a great movie!
I:9509;327;But what do you excpect with a great cast great writer and great director.
I:9509;328;"The acting was great in this movie take for example ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" what a distrubing but great scene that was!"
I:9509;329;Tarintino wins big with this movie about crimanals and what can happen to them in a messed up situation.
I:9509;330;The dialouge that they use is another one of the great things in all his films.
I:9509;331;And as I said before in my Pulp Fiction review they way he narrates all his stories is great!
I:9509;332;Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS is a masterpiece, reaching far past any other film in the crime drama genre.
I:9509;333;His use of unique camera angles and flashbacks not only qualify it as a great film, but as a fine example of cinematic art.
I:9509;334;From the first minute of the film, he has you guessing as to who these men are, and what their intentions are.
I:9509;335;His perfect development of characters helps portray the seriousness of the situation, as we soon learn to understand the conflict at hand.
I:9509;336;Newcomers Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth acted exceptionally, resulting in their being recognized as talented up.
I:9509;337;Because RESERVOIR DOGS is guaranteed to bring the viewer onto a roller.
I:9509;338;High Definition improves the experience of that's possible.
I:9509;339;the story is simple really, a well planned but fataly bungled jewel heist takes place.
I:9509;340;The movie got a perfect cast among others Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel(and Lawrence Tierney in his best role since forever).
I:9509;341;sometimes you get a feeling that there is no script but that the actors make up what they say themself, and that they really ARE having a good time.
I:9509;342;It seems that the interaction between the actors are perfect in this gem of a movie.
I:9509;343;This probably makes it harder to view a more raw and brutal film that started his legacy as an homage director/writer, but this film is still solid.
I:9509;344;Viewing it forces you to look for what isn't there as opposed to what is there in the shot or the script.
I:9509;345;The flashbacks work well enough and we see the beginning of the three act feel he employs in later films.
I:9509;346;That's great, Sherlock, how long did it take you to figure that one out?
I:9509;347;I first saw Reservoir Dogs on video, and I remember very vividly that first experience of seeing such a fascinating story told in such an original way.
I:9509;348;style, that one of the members of the heist team is really an undercover agent, meant to disrupt it.
I:9509;349;watchin these men turn on each other as they try to figure out who was the plant, how to save Roth, and how are they going to explain this to the boss makes for a story that has surprising depth and twists.
I:9509;350;Tarrantino is a MASTER with dialogue, and this was the film that set his bar extremely high.
I:9509;351;the casting for this was impeccable as well.
I:9509;352;(Keitel also was so impressed with Tarrantino's script that he was the driving force in getting the financing, and took a serious pay cut to have the film made) Chris Penn also has a terrific turn as the thug.
I:9509;353;Also, the extras are really better than you would expect on a film this old.
I:9509;354;an excellent brew of action/comedy.
I:9509;355;i loved the use of dialoge, and how all the events fell into place.
I:9509;356;Some of the most quoted lines in cinema history and some of the most nototrious scenes belong to this film, one of Tarantino's best.
I:9509;357;This is a film about killers .
I:9509;358;it is a cartoon sort of film with cartoon dialogue spoken by cartoon characters.
I:9509;359;It is loved by cartoon characters who relate to the cartoon characters in the film.
I:9509;360;It was a decent movie.
I:9509;361;very violent and quite comic book in style, this film is better paced and more genuinely funny and shocking in places than the vastly overated and sluggish Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;362;"Wanting to give films more recognition than they would've done otherwise, he helps get more attention to films by giving a ""presented by."""
I:9509;363;credit such as on absolute pieces of.you know for Hostel and actually for a really good movie with Hero.
I:9509;364;Will people love it as much as Pulp Fiction?
I:9509;365;type conversations with his witty dialogue.
I:9509;366;"Some of it doesn't work (I still don't find the theory behind Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"" funny) but then in other cases, it's extremely funny."
I:9509;367;the casting is quite spot.
I:9509;368;However everyone else, especially Harvey Kietel work perfectly.
I:9509;369;I'll also say Tim Roth does a good job but people might find his high.
I:9509;370;heist stuff, such as meeting Mr. Blonde and Mr. White or Mr. Orange telling a story in a bar.
I:9509;371;assurance that I love here.
I:9509;372;While lately it seems his name is everywhere but not new movies, it's still good to see one of the 90's better movies.
I:9509;373;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:9509;374;Trust me, you'll love this movie if you life Quentin Tarantino work.
I:9509;375;This is movie that is a must see.
I:9509;376;My take was that two thirds of it was a very good, interesting film, but a third of it was just self conscious direction with a lot of the hip ultra.
I:9509;377;top melodrama of the three.
I:9509;378;top and, in my opinion, indulgent groaning, moaning and spluttering of Keitel at the end?As I said, I found about two.
I:9509;379;thirds of the movie pretty good.
I:9509;380;Every phrase, every sentence, every word wrapped around one another to provide the most intelligent, witty dialogue any one movie has ever produced.
I:9509;381;Add the stellar performance of a number of Hollywood pros and Resevoir Dog's will flatten you.
I:9509;382;I FLAT OUT love this movie.
I:9509;383;If you enjoy peering into the dark underbelly of humanity you will enjoy Tarantino's film.
I:9509;384;He then wrote this one and luckily it found its way into the hands of Harvey Keitel.
I:9509;385;reservoir Dogs is about a powerful mob boss and his son.
I:9509;386;They both hire four perfect killers for the perfect crime.
I:9509;387;beautiful acting, great camera work and a real gangster like atmosphere.
I:9509;388;Graphic violence and pervasive language can make it a little intense.
I:9509;389;important role in a movie you're directing when you can afford to hire actual actors is incredibly egotistical.
I:9509;390;I like the dark humor that' part of many of Tarantino's movies.
I:9509;391;there are some good things like the use of flashbacks and some good dialog.
I:9509;392;"Well the ""Mr. Blue"" stuff comes from that great old movie, The Taking Of Pelham 1,2,3."
I:9509;393;And thanks for the Madonna explanation, Quentin, you're a classy guy.
I:9509;394;this movie is to film noir what Jim Carey is to comedy.
I:9509;395;One of the best movies all time.
I:9509;396;It's a tipical Tarantino movie, little twisted, but really entertaining.
I:9509;397;"I have always loved this movie, it is definitely a great movie if you are a fan of ""pulp""ish movies."
I:9509;398;called, and I gotta say, I feel SO MUCH like I've (still!)
I:9509;399;"in Richard Linklater's ""Slacker,"" there's an instance ."
I:9509;400;mo, see all the details .
I:9509;401;"okay, so: the sequences involving Roth all seemed to be done ""in one take""
I:9509;402;I really did wonder (marvel?)
I:9509;403;"at how Roth was able to give such a ""realistic"" performance ."
I:9509;404;I love Pulp Fiction, so I thought this must be a great movie, too.
I:9509;405;This movie has a great cast but a simple plot.
I:9509;406;Bloody, violent and masterfully crafted.
I:9509;407;Much of the elements that make Pulp Fiction a classic are present in this earlier work.
I:9509;408;Look closely and you'll see a cameo by Steven Segal!
I:9509;409;This is an excellent, brilliantly written and acted film.
I:9509;410;The characters are so believable and the situations they find themselves in are so realistic they border on the obsurd.
I:9509;411;Man this movie is great.
I:9509;412;Tarantino fan to the core so I'll always enjoy anything he releases, but this is just a classic.
I:9509;413;the first couple times you see this great classic, you'll be dazed, but sooner or later it'll hit you, as it has me, that the screenplay for Reservoir Dogs might be some of the best writing ever done in Hollywood.
I:9509;414;Quentin Tarrintino's ability to produce such fresh and genuine dialog is unparelleled!
I:9509;415;This movie is in a word, cool!
I:9509;416;"From the opening breakfast scene which is fantastic to what is probably one of the greatest scenes in movie history the infamous ""ear scene""!!!"
I:9509;417;qT's debut film is a powerful crime drama with images vivid enough to sear holes in your brain.
I:9509;418;Few directors who have been at work for decades can match the ferocity, passion, and sheer intensity found in Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;419;It is an unforgettable experience, whether you ultimately like the movie or not.
I:9509;420;rate, as usual with a Tarantino film.
I:9509;421;The dialogue is funny, obscene, insightful and instantly recognizable as QT.
I:9509;422;As a thriller, this is one tight little number.
I:9509;423;Reservoir Dogs was a great place to start, and as a writer and filmmaker, QT has improved tremendously.
I:9509;424;Of course I loved it.
I:9509;425;It is used both to shock the audience and to make them laugh.
I:9509;426;An excellent, moody, disturbing piece of work.
I:9509;427;But that's the price for breaking new ground.
I:9509;428;Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is an American ganster classic.
I:9509;429;It's clever and well written, nicely acted and intense and even a bit funny at times.
I:9509;430;The film's cast includes an ensemble of fine actors including: Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink along with a small role from Tarantino himself.
I:9509;431;in 1992, Tarantino stunned many with this fine acheivement in filmmaking, working from his own screenplay.
I:9509;432;One of the gansters among them is more deceptive than he seems and the intensity is at its highest.
I:9509;433;tarantino soon went on the road to stardom making bigger movies,including the amazing Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bill films, Vol.
I:9509;434;If you want to see an excellent debut from a great director, see Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;435;writer/Director/Actor Quentin Tarantino serves up some great dialogue and plot twists, and the Actors (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi) are all at the top of their games.
I:9509;436;But if you can suspend the disbelief for 90 minutes, this IS a great film.
I:9509;437;This movie will forever remain a piece of 1990's nostalgia.
I:9509;438;Reservoir Dogs gives you that distinct vibe throughout.
I:9509;439;This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again.
I:9509;440;It takes at least 2 viewings to fully understand and appreciate this gem from Quentin Tarantino.
I:9509;441;It broke new ground and surprised you at every corner.
I:9509;442;It has a brand new remastered anamorphic video transfer which is greatly improved over even the 2002 addition.
I:9509;443;Plus, a new 6.1 DTS audio track.
I:9509;444;OK movie overall but not great.
I:9509;445;It moves at a much faster pace than Pulp Fiction does, and it's a far more interesting movie!
I:9509;446;One of the robbers is killed, and another critically injured.
I:9509;447;These guys want the money, they want it quick: they're willing to shed ample amounts of bled and skin and flesh and bone for it, for chrissakes.
I:9509;448;Reservoir Dogs isn't fancy: that's it's glory, really: it's pure pulp fiction, brutal, so brutal, frankly, you can just about taste that warm and caustic summer.
I:9509;449;dropping performances, solid, good, blazingly cool because you forget they're performances.
I:9509;450;edge to the dulcet dancing toe.
I:9509;451;I love Terantino's movies, by far my favorite being the Kill Bill movies.
I:9509;452;"But I totally recommend it for Terantino fans who want to see it in a better format and the ""Blu."
I:9509;453;"This is my ""favorite"" movie/story next to NBK's By writer/director Quentin Tarantino flick altogether!"
I:9509;454;Between the characters dialogue and personalities, as well as their behavior given the situation(a heist/ambush, gone crazy) bodes for an amusing(to say the least)gangster flick with a great cast.
I:9509;455;"In contrast to Quentin Tarantino's more polished and more elaborate later work, ""Reservoir Dogs"" pales in comparison."
I:9509;456;Considering that, this film is a smashing success.
I:9509;457;The dialogue that Tarantino has written for his characters is priceless, the tension he ratcheted up is palpable, and the performances he's gotten from his actors is top.
I:9509;458;They work as a true ensemble, like an efficient machine.
I:9509;459;Tierney was a real character and it is lovingly related in this tribute.
I:9509;460;This is a classic . . . a classic Tarantino.
I:9509;461;This was 5 bucks, and blu ray and already a movie that i loved.
I:9509;462;I dont see why the directing is so amazing, I just loved the story.
I:9509;463;Its one of those movies that keeps you guessing the whole way through, and your still suprised when you get to the end.
I:9509;464;It was boring at parts, but a little while in, it gets real good.
I:9509;465;and come the end, its pure suspense.
I:9509;466;A great early effort by QT, but he got a lot better with his later movies, particularly Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill 1&2 and Inglorious Basterds.
I:9509;467;I'm sure it's fun and rewarding for him, but good lord he sucks as an actor.
I:9509;468;Reservoir Dogs is one of the best movies I have seen.
I:9509;469;"I rank it with great movies like
I:9509;470;I found it to have great character development, and great interaction between the characters.
I:9509;471;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9509;472;, but for now this will have to do.
I:9509;473;Doesn't have that many extras, but is still probably the best version around.
I:9509;474;Tarintino may be a jerk in real life, but boy is he good at his job.
I:9509;475;anyone who knows the director knows that this movies would be (and is) filled to the teeth with excellent dialogue and time shifts that hieghten the suspense.
I:9509;476;also with great acting, neat cinematography, and one of the most gut wrenching scenes ever, RESERVOIR DOGS is a truly wonderful film.
I:9509;477;The dialogue is quick and snappy and in some parts extremely funny.
I:9509;478;this movie is ultimate cool and there are scenes that you will never forget, ie.
I:9509;479;my favourite film of all time.
I:9509;480;A classic of Tarantino violence with several interesting sub.
I:9509;481;when historians do look back they will surely take a gander at this film, director Quentin Tarantino's celebrated breakout cult classic.
I:9509;482;Anyone reading this has already seen the movie or certainly knows about its content.
I:9509;483;The behavior of the men while superficially realistic is actually stylized in the extreme.
I:9509;484;It can be said that Reservoir Dogs appeals primarily to young men and teenaged boys, who are preoccupied with coming to grips with violence because it represents an important part of their lives, and how they might relate to violence is an essential part of their self discovery.
I:9509;485;Even given that there is still a male bias on the web, this is an extraordinarily high rating for the first film of any director and for such a low budget enterprise.
I:9509;486;letting and the macho posturing, but in a story well told, well.
I:9509;487;plotted and of characters well.
I:9509;488;drawn and especially the indelible acting performances from most of the cast.
I:9509;489;This technique allows Tarantino great freedom of expression and emphasis.
I:9509;490;And all those stylized speeches!
I:9509;491;Seeing it in my middle years leaves me a little cold.
I:9509;492;incidentally I agree with those who say that this is a greater artistic achievement than the Hollywoodized Pulp Fiction (1995), also directed by Tarantino.
I:9509;493;One of my favorite Tarantino movies!
I:9509;494;Classic story line, bloody, great cast, just an all around good movie!
I:9509;495;There are a lot of flashbacks to the planning stages and the various participants, and even flashbacks to the getaway.
I:9509;496;It gets quite graphic and intense.
I:9509;497;Quentin Tarantino assembled an excellent cast with a dynamite script to deliver a fresh, bold, stark, graphic picture of the classic jewelry store heist that is truly one of the best pictures ever made!
I:9509;498;As I said, I'm not a big fan of cops and robbers flicks, but this is just a terrific movie!
I:9509;499;Quentin joins a cast that features Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Christopher Penn and Steve Buscemi in a dark, bold and very graphic portrait of some very nasty people!
I:9509;500;And Lawrence Tierney is fabulous in the role of Joe, the boss who arranged the robbery.
I:9509;501;I even enjoy comedian Steven Wright's voice used as the disc jockey for the background used of the robbers' favorite radio station.
I:9509;502;It was an interesting way to hold the whole package together.
I:9509;503;I very highly recommend this film!
I:9509;504;I got this for my brother as it's one of his favorite movies!
I:9509;505;I liked this movie because i like these kinds of movies.
I:9509;506;So go watch it for your self and rate it.
I:9509;507;It hasn't dated a bit since its release 10 years ago (though that's because of its almost vintage look to begin with) and still packs a wallop, remaining a bold, exhilarating, unique masterpiece, with all of the energy and fresh creativity of a movie.
I:9509;508;Tim Roth's comments on his own work are always wonderfully insightful, and I would have loved to hear Harvey Keitel talk about the film, given his crucial role in getting the film financed.
I:9509;509;A terrific surprise is cinematographer Andrzej Sekula's commentary.
I:9509;510;Another surprise commentary is by Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers, whose insight into this film's use of music is very convincing.
I:9509;511;An ingenious job in marketing, perhaps, but the bonus materials somehow left me unsatiated.
I:9509;512;"disc issue of Traffic, for example
I:9509;513;easy story line to follow plenty of action and humor also!!!!
I:9509;514;This is a terrific movie.
I:9509;515;The acting is stellar, the action is great, and the story is riveting.
I:9509;516;"This is the third frickin' time I have bought this movie because this is the new ""Special Edition""."
I:9509;517;access to free classic movies.
I:9509;518;I've heard of this one for years and may have seen bits and pieces of it before, but it was a real pleasure to watch the entire movie on my Kindle.
I:9509;519;I like action and drama movies the best.
I:9509;520;I like a movie that gets my attention from the start.
I:9509;521;My Son in Law loves this movie and he recommended it It was drawn out and I didn't think it actually got interesting until the end.
I:9509;522;Looks fantastic the transfer is great and this movie holds up well over time.
I:9509;523;This has to be the best robbery movie ever made.
I:9509;524;at times funny and at other times graphically brutal, it's a must see for fans of Quintin Tarantino, Elmore Leonard.
I:9509;525;A very good and clever film by the great Tarantino.
I:9509;526;Widescreen picture is an added bonus.
I:9509;527;This movie holds up to repeated veiwings and it gets better each time.
I:9509;528;"The film is advertised on Amazon as a special edition coming in unique ""special edition"" packaging."
I:9509;529;This was a great debut from one of today's greatest directors.
I:9509;530;I didn't like it the first time I saw it but after I watched it a few more times I really started to see how great of a movie it was.
I:9509;531;What really made this film great was the actors.
I:9509;532;The whole cast was great in their respectable roles.
I:9509;533;He does a good job of portraying a man who tries, unsuccessfully, not to let his emotions get in the way of his job.
I:9509;534;It's a great performance but not the best in the movie.
I:9509;535;tim Roth: Roth probably gives the weakest of the movie's performances but it's still a good one.
I:9509;536;What makes his performance so good is that he doesn't play it over.
I:9509;537;top as a lot of actors would.
I:9509;538;chris Penn: This is probably Penn's best performance as Nice Guy Eddie the son of Joe, the man who set up the job.
I:9509;539;His performance is up there in the top three with Madsen and Buscemi.
I:9509;540;lawrence Tiereny: Tiereny is very good in his role as Joe Cabot, the tough old crime boss who set up the job.
I:9509;541;all in all this is an actor's movie where the performances, more than anything else drive the film.
I:9509;542;If you like this movie I would also recommend everything else Tarantino has directed which is: Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Volume's 1 and 2, and of course Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;543;Tarantino's inimitable genius lies in his ability to simultaneously build up and destroy film cliches.
I:9509;544;each characters personality oozes from every word he speaks.
I:9509;545;However other writers appear to have reverted to their old lazy selves and it will take another Tarantino to come along and shake everything up again.
I:9509;546;Very good acting and thank god it was just acting couldn't wait for the movie to end.
I:9509;547;Quentin Tarantino's classic American gangster movie, my favorite gangster movie.
I:9509;548;Reservoir Dogs was one of my first Quentin Tarantino movie, I watched it and liked it more than Kill Bill.
I:9509;549;This movie has excellent acting too with Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Harvey Keitel and others.
I:9509;550;"The ""Ear"" scene is also very powerful."
I:9509;551;Great movie, I highly recommend it.
I:9509;552;I was so happy to finally get the 10th Ann.
I:9509;553;The extras on this release are just awesome, and are worth the price of the disc alone.
I:9509;554;The Mr. Brown keep case, from what I've been told, is the most rare one.
I:9509;555;Either way, enjoy this film.
I:9509;556;This is a great movie about a robbery gone wrong.
I:9509;557;Quentin Terantino's great dialogue brought this movie together with his great skill in directing.
I:9509;558;This movie is very special because unlike much other bank robbery movies, this doesn't focus on the reward(example: money).
I:9509;559;It's like reading in between the lines, but Terantino gives the viewer the image.
I:9509;560;This new kind of image creates a brillant film, which i thought had one of the most creative endings.
I:9509;561;that was just some top notch dialogue.
I:9509;562;A very good edition of this great film, in a beautiful metallic box simulating a really incredible gasoline boat and the package where the disc are simulating a matchbox, a very good version with many extras and good sound in the film.
I:9509;563;A wonderful by Tarantino with great actors!
I:9509;564;5 Highly recommended for those who love real drama!
I:9509;565;I can watch this over and over again and I love it every time
I:9509;566;I would encourage the director to produce a work of art.
I:9509;567;Excellent movie, directing, acting, and casting.
I:9509;568;What makes Quentin Tarantino movies so good is the character development.
I:9509;569;I would highly recommend this movie along with any other Tarantino movie.
I:9509;570;No crazy CG special effects, just good solid performances and Tarantino's signature over.
I:9509;571;A simple and nice way to do movies, Tarantino its just a great film maker, no big efects but an awesome realism and a very elaborate history in a cool twist.
I:9509;572;Let it first be said that I think Quentin Tarantino is one of the best living directors we have.
I:9509;573;He is so good, indeed, that he has developed on one hand a fan base that is fanatically devoted to him and an equally passionate crowd of detractors who think he's insufferable and can't stand him.
I:9509;574;There's rarely a middle ground to rest your feet on with Tarantino, because his talents are so undeniable that when they do not inspire adoration, they inspire jealousy.
I:9509;575;He has made four films in fifteen years, and yet his body of work as of today is enough to place him in any conversation about the most skilled muses of our generation.
I:9509;576;bending slice of LA sleaze (and a terrific comedy of manners), Jackie Brown was a wonderfully well.
I:9509;577;crafted, heartfelt crime film, and Kill Bill was an epic meditation on just about everything there is to love about film.
I:9509;578;But Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was a skillful throwaway that is consistently entertaining but never compelling.
I:9509;579;The most sympathetic character in the movie is the cop.
I:9509;580;He just wants us to admire how neatly he's set everything up.
I:9509;581;Every role is acted well, and every character comes to life in his limited capacity.
I:9509;582;well, you get the idea.
I:9509;583;Tarantino's first film was a well.
I:9509;584;It has all the emotional content of a billiards game, and proceeds just as geometrically.
I:9509;585;"This is a spectacularly good idea
I:9509;586;Quentin Tarantino is just simply brilliant.
I:9509;587;He's coming out with special editions of all of his films.
I:9509;588;I just think Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the 90's.
I:9509;589;I think he pays attention to the best music and puts it on his soundtracks.
I:9509;590;I also hope to see more good movies from him.
I:9509;591;Every now and then comes a new director in the entertainment industry that awakens us all with his work.
I:9509;592;mimicked style of filmmaking in the nineteen.
I:9509;593;This man is not only a terrific actor but director, too.
I:9509;594;"He has yet directed two exceptional films entitled ""Trees Lounge"" and ""Animal House"", and one of the most popular adult television series that can actually be majored to such others as The West Wing, being what else but The Sopranos of course."
I:9509;595;seven, that features a harsh and realistic look of prison life.)
I:9509;596;the actors had truly done an amazing job together and were very believable, except for Michael Madsen, who's never really capable of keeping a straight face when needed to, and yet I see him starring in more and more films nowadays despite the fact that he's not even a very good actor to begin with.
I:9509;597;The bond between Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel's character, whose presence in a melodrama is like a sanction, was terrific.
I:9509;598;"As you watch such distressing sequences, watch him bleeding to death, sobbing when not unconscious and pleading to be sent to the hospital when such a move would be impossible if not wanting to be locked behind bars, there is no doubt that Roth will completely take your breath away
I:9509;599;well, you would think that as all this goes on inside that warehouse that just happens to be set within a neighborhood, that someone, some nearby citizen would become aware of all the screaming and gunshots that were being fired.
I:9509;600;time director, I'll let that go by.
I:9509;601;i was pleasantly surprised by this feature film debut of Quentin Tarantino as writer/director.
I:9509;602;as it turns out,it was a pretty good film.
I:9509;603;smooth transitions from one scenes to another.
I:9509;604;true romance is much more blood soaked than Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;605;Great movie that will have your attention throughout the whole movie.
I:9509;606;The Movie was pretty interesting but seriously, Hollywood, we need to have a talk.
I:9509;607;I know the success of the recent Batman, James Bond, and Lambchop movies have taught you that gritty reboots are the way to go.
I:9509;608;Very good,a classic film that shows the gritty down under belly.
I:9509;609;americana at its best .
I:9509;610;A well written, well acted creation which allows writer.
I:9509;611;"boy"" type allows us to see a side of society that is not often witnessed first hand, in this way we believe we acquire a knowledge of crime and we are satisfied with good entertainment."
I:9509;612;"quentin Tarantino' ""Reservoir Dogs"" surely brings to us a highly entertaining, crime movie."
I:9509;613;also included in this 2 disc set are a widescreen version and a standard version (i find having 2 formats useless) many interviews, many commentaries, many special features, with a cool menu (all of Tarantino'sfilm have cool, interactive menus).
I:9509;614;This movie provides great entertainment and an insight into human behavior.
I:9509;615;"regardless that Tarantino used other films for his inspiration
I:9509;616;and is viewed today .
I:9509;617;as one of the very best films of the 1990's.
I:9509;618;it combines high frequency cinematic adreniline and strangeley thoughtful character study.
I:9509;619;Dogs meets and exceeds Pulp in many ways.
I:9509;620;the plot construction is a landmark, the acting absolutley brillant, the directing well done, the cinamatography appropritaley simple, and everything came together very well.
I:9509;621;five stars is literally every respect.
I:9509;622;well maybe not the best (close enough) but what a terrific movie.
I:9509;623;Proves that mobsters are really funny.
I:9509;624;One of the best movies ever, can watch it over and over again.
I:9509;625;I've always enjoyed Quentin Tarantino movies and Steve Buscemi is one of my favorite actors.
I:9509;626;This is a totally sublime must watch!!
I:9509;627;Reservoir Dogs is absolutely one of the best movies Quentin Tarantino has ever made and one of the best movies of all.
I:9509;628;Reservoir Dogs is one of those movies you just have to see.
I:9509;629;There are some special features, such as interviews and alternate scenes.
I:9509;630;It is a classic movie.
I:9509;631;what can i say, its a classic must have in your collection kind of movie with an all star cast!
I:9509;632;It is a MUST HAVE for Quentin Tarantino fans!
I:9509;633;If you loved Pulp Fiction, you'll love Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;634;This is Tarantino's first and shortest film, and yet it can't help but blow everyone away.
I:9509;635;This is the one film by Tarantino where if he had the chance to go back now, and change anything he wanted to, he would change nothing, this is perfect as it is.
I:9509;636;second, I'd like to mention the amazing performance by none other than Mr. Steve Buscemi, who in my opinion is just the greatest character in the film, and the other person who could ever fill that role of Mr. Pink, who's ending is just the greatest of them all, I would love to see a tv series spin.
I:9509;637;off or another movie entitled Mr. Pink, since his story was the one that really didn't recieve as much attention as it should have, not including Brown and Blue of course, plus Steve Buscemi is just amazing.
I:9509;638;To those of you who compare this with Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction go get Jackie Brown, and be delighted.
I:9509;639;It has everything that makes for a great guy flick.
I:9509;640;It has action, an intriguing story and tons of bad language.
I:9509;641;The acting in the film is just what I like.
I:9509;642;Tim Roth does excellent as Mr. Orange, and you really believe he is in pain the entire time.
I:9509;643;Steve Buscemi is the sarcastic Mr. Pink that provides a little of the comic relief of the film, even though he is being serious the entire time.
I:9509;644;"For a debut film from an unknown director at the time, Quentin Tarantino does a remarkable job in front of and behind the camera
I:9509;645;It is very interesting and informative, but you can't really take it to heart since it feels more like speculation instead of real facts about the characters.
I:9509;646;finally got it, and man was worth it!
I:9509;647;Omg best movie ever .
I:9509;648;The movie attracted considerable critical acclaim, and it deserved it.
I:9509;649;Most of the movie is pure dialog which took place at a limited number of settings.
I:9509;650;It's complicated, but thought provoking.
I:9509;651;The movie was a very interesting study of character and the tension built to a catastrophic climax.
I:9509;652;It was an exceptionally well done movie.
I:9509;653;The acting was absolutely first rate!
I:9509;654;It's worth the effort!Gary Peterson
I:9509;655;This is where it all started with Quentin Tarantino, and I got to say that it could have not started any better!
I:9509;656;rarely have I seen such intensity and humanity in one action movie.
I:9509;657;The genious use of flashbacks create a background for the characters, making it easier to identify with them.
I:9509;658;It also makes sense when we think about the plot.
I:9509;659;Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi give a breathtaking performances, and Tarantino helps the plot progress smoothly.
I:9509;660;hero, is worth of respect.
I:9509;661;Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie and it proved right away that he was a genious.
I:9509;662;he is an extraordinary writer, perfecting the dialogue and details of every scene.
I:9509;663;He takes Mr. Pink and Mr. White to get rid of their cars to get rid of evidence.
I:9509;664;He leaves Mr. Blonde to look after the passed out Mr. Orange and the cop.
I:9509;665;The cop is pleading for his life.
I:9509;666;Great directing, great writing and most of all great dialogue, just as in Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;667;his ability to write what people would actually say and putting the right dialect on it and everything.
I:9509;668;But overall a must see movie.
I:9509;669;Quentin Tarantino's first movie is so good that it should be almost impossible to make a better (or to some, on par) movie after it.
I:9509;670;Of course we know he did that with `Pulp Fiction' but here Tarantino already shows us how great he is.
I:9509;671;The direction from Tarantino is extremely sharp, Michael Madsen is pure evil and Buscemi, Keitel and especially Roth give fine performances as well.
I:9509;672;Another great thing is the soundtrack from The George Baker Selection with Little Green Bag to Harry Nilsson with Coconut.
I:9509;673;A great first movie from a great director.
I:9509;674;ok, the torture scene is intense, but still a great piece of flimmaking.
I:9509;675;steve buscemi is my favorite actor, and thought i won't give it away, he has the best part.
I:9509;676;Pointless and artsy, but wuth a great cast.
I:9509;677;Is it a rite of passage to hip.
I:9509;678;WHY is this movie so popular.
I:9509;679;dressed with a gun and a New Yawk accent.
I:9509;680;production movie I've ever seen, I'd rank this right up there with Kung Fu Shuffle and Big Momma's House.
I:9509;681;This film definitely demands a major aquired taste.
I:9509;682;fest I have ever seen.
I:9509;683;"I bought this after loving ""Pulp Fiction"" to pieces, and had to see what all the hype was about."
I:9509;684;In every one of his films, he puts in a few highly memorable yet disturbing scenes that rule the cinema.
I:9509;685;"For example, the syringe full of adrenaline in ""Pulp Fiction."""
I:9509;686;It is extremely intense and very sad.
I:9509;687;"this is basically the good version of a ""chick flick."""
I:9509;688;The end is very powerful, the perfect thing to end a movie with.
I:9509;689;I wouldn't be eating while watching this, it's a film you need to pay much attention to and has you glued in.
I:9509;690;i got the Mr. Brown version because it was signed by Quentin Tarantino and because he is the creator, even though he has a small role in the film.
I:9509;691;Some of my favorite actors .
I:9509;692;I actually enjoyed this movie.
I:9509;693;I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing.
I:9509;694;The cast and their performances are unparalleled.
I:9509;695;This is a real nail bitter.
I:9509;696;Great character studies hold your interest throughout despite the implied graphic violence.
I:9509;697;Resovoir dogs is the first attempt of a man destined to conquer and rock the movie world forever.
I:9509;698;With its wit, naturalistic dialouge, and twisty curvy story, resovoir dogs had me hooked and paying attention within the first 2 minutes.
I:9509;699;The real highlight of Tarantino's style is his novelistic way of telling a story on film.
I:9509;700;It's more like a bunch of short stories, all put together to make one super story.
I:9509;701;the cast of resovoir dogs is dynamite, and they all fit and work together very very well.
I:9509;702;cooker movie, complete with perfect dialouge and qoutably cool scenes.
I:9509;703;My personal favorite of all Tarantinos films.
I:9509;704;I love this film because you can see all of Tarantino's potential as a filmmaker seeping out of every corner.
I:9509;705;Kind of like looking at someone's baby pictures.
I:9509;706;He has always had an amazing ability to choose soundtrack material, and this movie is no exception.
I:9509;707;The cast is perfect, although there are no female characters.
I:9509;708;(Forgivable considering the plot, and he has more than proved his appreciation for the strong leading woman in subsequent films.)
I:9509;709;All are truly unique, at varying levels of likability, and there is never a dull moment with the lot.
I:9509;710;Of course, I bought this movie because I saw that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino.
I:9509;711;I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
I:9509;712;This movie is very good.
I:9509;713;it has a high level violence and i like it.
I:9509;714;I'm Telling you, this movie is pure Tarantino!!!!!!!!!!!
I:9509;715;This is ANOTHER classic movie from the 90's.
I:9509;716;This is one of his better movies.
I:9509;717;I liked the way it told the story and the relentless violence plus the ending is a total mind blower.
I:9509;718;This was just a great movie.
I:9509;719;I love this film and thinkit's one Tarantino's best.
I:9509;720;disc set hasnice picture and sound plus neat extras.
I:9509;721;I had good expectations for Reservoir Dogs since I really like Kill Bill, both volumes.
I:9509;722;When I saw this film, I really liked it.
I:9509;723;It was visceral, interesting, and unforgettable.
I:9509;724;So, is it still good?
I:9509;725;Yes, you should see it once or twice, but don't expect to resonate over the years like great films usually do.
I:9509;726;The sound is fine, yet .
I:9509;727;I found myself constantly fiddling with the colour, contrast and brightness buttons.
I:9509;728;Easily one of the best films of the nineties, if not the best.
I:9509;729;Half film, half theatre, with some of the best dialogues one can imagine, the best one.
I:9509;730;, this is a rare all male movie .
I:9509;731;Tarantino is good with gangsters, real or imaginary, never mind.
I:9509;732;They speak cool, act cool (special mention here in this film for Harvey Keitel of course, and Steve Buscemi).
I:9509;733;Man, what a film, what a director!
I:9509;734;"You have such great actors like Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Penn
I:9509;735;A lot of blah blah blah.
I:9509;736;It is about time this noirish gem received a first.
I:9509;737;Gritty characters, kaleidoscopic technique, architectural design, and numerous hysterical lines make this signature film the rich classic that it is.
I:9509;738;top hijinks, in my book.
I:9509;739;"frame design, Dogs is spiritually closer to ""The Killing"", another heist."
I:9509;740;bones and pure than Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;741;"look a bit more closely at ALL the objects in the background and you will see just what kind of ""warehouse"" it is."
I:9509;742;Great collectible edition of this, whether you're simply a Reservoir Dogs fan or a Quentin Tarantino fan in general!
I:9509;743;thing is i bought and lent it to my uncle, so i havent seen it yet.
I:9509;744;All these years later, all those cool films, yet the first one is still my favorite.
I:9509;745;The mythology (for want of a better word) behind Tarantino's early work is interesting.
I:9509;746;Little connections among early drafts of many of his works fascinate me.
I:9509;747;This gets the 5 stars cause it's worth watching and also has a great cast which is common in Tarantino's films!
I:9509;748;Perfect example of a movie with a great cast and garbage for plot and production.
I:9509;749;In Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino amazingly shows his creativity and directing.
I:9509;750;still, everything seems quiet and peaceful, in the next scenes, however, the film showes its real face, full of violence.
I:9509;751;Further Tarantino plays in an impressive way with camera.
I:9509;752;all in all Reservoir Dogs is a masterpiece of a gangsterfilm and absolutely recommendable.
I:9509;753;If you haven't seen it yet, go and get it!
I:9509;754;"upsmanship between Vick Vega and 'Nice Guy Eddie
I:9509;755;"The curt way in which death occurs emphasizes the difference between this genere and the martial arts/action genere showcased in the later 'Kill Bill
I:9509;756;developed your character, all it takes is one gunshot, and it's over.
I:9509;757;The symphonic structure given by Tarantino obeys to one of the most ancient traditions of the Italian spirit: the undeniable musicality.
I:9509;758;this surprising first Opus of Quentin Tarantino is an admirable testimony the Noir Film is far from dying.
I:9509;759;"The First Movement is the initial dialog around the table
I:9509;760;The table is the most important place meeting of the gangsters: the succulent food allows to boast, dream and establish the ideas without restrictions.
I:9509;761;the rest of the story runs for you: and here is the great match point of Tarantino.
I:9509;762;tarantino made possible to materialize the best American noir film of the Nineties.
I:9509;763;one of my personal cult movies in any age.
I:9509;764;it's a compelling and dramatic film about a heist that ultimately goes south.
I:9509;765;featuring some stand out performances from Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen, this film is one of Tarantino's best.
I:9509;766;great having it on Blu.
I:9509;767;"How Quentin Tarantino managed to pull off such an awsome cast for his first film is beyond me
I:9509;768;The style Tarantino uses is clever.
I:9509;769;He often goes back in time, to the time of the robbery and beyond, which sometimes shows us the background of the characters.
I:9509;770;That's just an example of a lot of the very entertaining dialouge throughout the film.
I:9509;771;He plays a great Mr White, and one of his buddies, Mr Orange (Tim Roth), is equally cool.
I:9509;772;Mr Pink is entertaining .
I:9509;773;him being so anxious and paraniod is great, Steve Busemi suits this role to the bone.
I:9509;774;reservoir Dogs has a great ending as well.
I:9509;775;If you are the person who can get past the layer of rough language and violence in a film, Reservoir Dogs will keep you watching to the end, then leave you thinking 'That was a good movie.'
I:9509;776;"Its a case of ""honour amongst theives"" and as the tension rises the film becomes more enduringly compelling, packed with attitude."
I:9509;777;laced and sharp, fast dialogue and some outstanding performances from its array of stars.
I:9509;778;Each star bites into its character with a venegance and carries it off with style, displaying, raw, gritty and instinctive realism.
I:9509;779;slashing Mr. Blonde, whilst Harvey Kietels Mr. White displays a more two dimensional chaater.
I:9509;780;Particularly outstanding is Tim Roth as the ill.
I:9509;781;The film is packed with surprise twist and turns and each scene is played out too utter perfection.
I:9509;782;The harrowing climax is essentially effective, whilst th film also holds many other brutal, stomach.
I:9509;783;A must see as its an absolute masterpiece that will have you glued to your seat from beginning to end!
I:9509;784;i can definitely say it's a gem among sh*t.
I:9509;785;the majority of all movies are complete garbage, so it's crazy to find such a great movie from a new director.
I:9509;786;so all i can really say is if you're interested in seeing a Shoot em' up flick that actually has good writing and actual unique cinematography.
I:9509;787;Reservoir Dogs, written by the incredible Quentin Tarantino is basically a robbery gone wrong.
I:9509;788;"One of the proposed ""professionals"" is actually a cop undercover working the group and set up the heist."
I:9509;789;Most of the action in this movie takes place inside a warehouse and involves great typical Tarantino dialogue.
I:9509;790;Great performances are given by: Steve Bucemi, Harvey Keitel, Micheal Mann, Tim Roth and an awesome cameo from Quentin himself makes this one of the best acted movies made in the 1990's.
I:9509;791;I watched it and loved it.
I:9509;792;Then she let me borrow Jackie Brown, which I also loved.
I:9509;793;In a time where a new breed of sensitive actors are all the rage, Reservoir Dogs stands alone as being one of the few films brave enough to stick with the tough.
I:9509;794;Quentin Tarantino is the mastermind behind this gem of a movie, which is in turns hilarious, disturbing, fierce, and ultimately heart.
I:9509;795;With the help of brilliant actor Harvey Keitel, who both supported the film financially and found the perfect cast, Tarantino has provided us with the most influential film of the 1990s.
I:9509;796;The acting is realistically gritty, the dialogue is delightfully crisp, and the soundtrack is one to die for.
I:9509;797;If you love movies, this is an essential view.
I:9509;798;even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.
I:9509;799;The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities .
I:9509;800;Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life.
I:9509;801;While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes).
I:9509;802;The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit `Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.
I:9509;803;tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise.
I:9509;804;Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out.
I:9509;805;Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him .
I:9509;806;The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch.
I:9509;807;"Tarantino is a picky director
I:9509;808;This is a good movie even with the F word tossed around quite a bit.
I:9509;809;i recommend everyone watch it.
I:9509;810;it's still a great movie though and definitely worth owning.
I:9509;811;This is one of the classic caper movies of all time.
I:9509;812;The movie boasts a strong set of characters played with with panache by a sterling group of actors.
I:9509;813;The arresting dialog sets this movie apart from the rest.
I:9509;814;The fact that they also discuss more humane topics and laugh and kid around with each other only serves to make the violence within them much more chilling.
I:9509;815;This movie also features a fantastic soundtrack that weaves among the segments, complementing perfectly the mood of each scene .
I:9509;816;This film was a stunning achievement when it was first released and stands today as an example of an honest, brutal movie.
I:9509;817;This movie was a good movie and great start for Tarantino directing life.
I:9509;818;It had a great script and the beginning for the film was very funny with them in the resturant.
I:9509;819;If you have loved more recent movies such as Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds, you will love Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;820;Classic gangster at its best.
I:9509;821;Resevoir Dogs was a knockout!
I:9509;822;I thouroughly enjoyed its creativity from the very first scene on.
I:9509;823;Quentin Tarantino's clout is so noticeable in all of his movies, but he really hit it big with this one.
I:9509;824;The movies that he writes and directs (True Romance, Jackie Brown) all have such dynamic characters and actors that portray them.
I:9509;825;It is truly fascinating to watch a Tarantino film.
I:9509;826;Tim Roth also did a fantastic performance.
I:9509;827;It was just an amazing movie that is probably most enjoyable (as all Tarantino films are) in a college group of friends.
I:9509;828;Its R rating reflects strong graphic violence and pervasive strong language.
I:9509;829;If you can overlook that however, you're in for a real treat with Resevoir Dogs.
I:9509;830;Yes, but it is highly humorous and deeply barbaric.
I:9509;831;There is always an intelligent wolf in a pack of wolves.
I:9509;832;A perfect exercise in studying what losing control of reality means and what being alienated to your own rules can become.
I:9509;833;Does it speak of real life for real ordinary people ?
I:9509;834;This is, and continues to be one of my favourite films.
I:9509;835;This film will stand for all time as a classic.
I:9509;836;Tartantino is a very gifted and creative man.
I:9509;837;They shot this whole movie in like 3 locations and it's a masterpiece.
I:9509;838;A must see again if you have.
I:9509;839;The acting, expecially by Tim Roth, is about the best you will see in any movie.
I:9509;840;These actors got into the characters and played them out exactly the way they should be played.
I:9509;841;With this being Tarantino's first big break in movies, you can see why they call him one of the best directors to arrive to cinema in decades.
I:9509;842;This is truly one of the greatest independent films ever made, let alone one of the greatest movies made period.
I:9509;843;this is the movie that made a video store employee working for minimum wage into one of the greatest figures in movie.
I:9509;844;through premier film displays his true talent for writing.
I:9509;845;It just goes to show how successful a high.
I:9509;846;The dialogue comes right off of the page and onto the screen.
I:9509;847;Some of the best acting I've seen in a movie.
I:9509;848;The speech flows completely naturally and like most of QT's films carrys the plot entirely.
I:9509;849;But when you think of the best movies of the nineties, Reservoir Dogs certainly comes to mind.
I:9509;850;But if your looking for a solid, fun.
I:9509;851;"The cast is amazing
I:9509;852;I loved the 10th anniversary edition so when I saw this one I wasn't sure if it was a trade up or not.
I:9509;853;The packaging is really cool and the actual movie itself seems to have been improved upon from both previous versions.
I:9509;854;Those are the positive aspects of the disc.
I:9509;855;The negative are the new special features.
I:9509;856;All in all if you're a big fan of the movie, having both versions is probably the best bet because of the new transfer.
I:9509;857;"day popular culture: he serves as a ""mirror"" reflecting the state of our increasingly."
I:9509;858;Reservoir Dogs is an appropriate example.
I:9509;859;"Incredibly, these are the very people who hail Tarantino as a ""great artist"" and who look forward to his ""uping the ante"" of blood and violence."
I:9509;860;Instead, find a film that will UPLIFT you.
I:9509;861;This film may have been overshadowed by Pulp Fiction, but it still is a classic in its own right.
I:9509;862;Trust me, despite how good Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were, this is Tarantino's best film.
I:9509;863;Mr. Pink is also great.
I:9509;864;Truly great, and not as encreadibly graphic as everyone says.
I:9509;865;You see blood, but a lot is in the distance.
I:9509;866;This is one of my favorite movies and I am so glad it is on blu ray (don't know what is taking Pulp Fiction so long).
I:9509;867;first of all, the movie itself looks and sounds a lot better.
I:9509;868;I thought the audio was more than passable, and it's in pro.
I:9509;869;The video is given a good solid transfer this time and looks great.
I:9509;870;the big improvement over the last release is the wealth of special features.
I:9509;871;There are so many interviews it's unreal, and they are all entertaining.
I:9509;872;Most of the cast members are interviewed and gie their own unique insight on how the movie was made, memories etc.
I:9509;873;The making of is a good story in and of itself.
I:9509;874;It's actually kind of inspiring when you get the whole story from the interviews and the commentary.
I:9509;875;There was some hilarious stuff in there.
I:9509;876;It's not as good as Pulp Fiction, but it's a great movie.
I:9509;877;There is no one to trust in this perfect emulation of classic film noir, and most end up lying on the floor of a blood.
I:9509;878;In a clever use of film art, Tarantino lets Mr. Orange recite this story as his physical self travels from his bedroom, to the performance in front of a cop, to the bar in which he tells it, to the actual imaginary scene itself where it finally ends.
I:9509;879;This film is entertaining as well as thought.
I:9509;880;provoking, and I'm glad it is so well rated.
I:9509;881;I don't know why it took me so long to get my hands on this but I got to it last night.
I:9509;882;Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done, but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast.
I:9509;883;Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his characte, and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie.
I:9509;884;His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particularly outstanding.
I:9509;885;Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White.
I:9509;886;Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the way the cast works with each other.
I:9509;887;Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has.
I:9509;888;"It's this mindset that, I think, has made ""Dogs"" the classic it is today."
I:9509;889;"An ideal would be to watch ""T&L
I:9509;890;"They are two great actors, and they deliver. """
I:9509;891;"Resevoir Dogs"" is a great film to watch,and for those who enjoyed Madsen in this will also like ""Kill Me Again."""
I:9509;892;This is by far my favorite movie ever made.
I:9509;893;My favorite thing about this film is the brilliant dialogue, almost every line is quotable.
I:9509;894;The whole casts performances are outstanding especially Michael Madsen as the vicious Vic Vega.
I:9509;895;This movie is intense and powerfull.
I:9509;896;The script is what classic is from and the angles and shots are great.
I:9509;897;The cast was unbeleaveble like Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blound.
I:9509;898;QT is a slick smart and powerfull writer.
I:9509;899;I cant wait to see Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;900;While this is a remorselessly vicious movie with some of the worst specimens humanity has to offer, there is something tremendously moving about it.
I:9509;901;A must for any lover of film.
I:9509;902;Stuck In the Middle With You will always make you perk your ears up after seeing this movie, in a manner of speaking.
I:9509;903;Quentin Tarantino is a master at making simple conversations between characters funny, interesting, and thought provoking.
I:9509;904;"The cast seems to fit the characters to a ""T""."
I:9509;905;I discover new dialog and scene inuendoes every time I watch.
I:9509;906;Quentin loves to surprise and SHOCK so if you dont enjoy blood and violence to enhance your viewing pleasure, maybe you should look elsewhere.
I:9509;907;Watch it with a friend or friends, and see what kind of conversatoinal craziness will ensue afterwards!
I:9509;908;This is a spectacular film and at.
I:9509;909;Reservoir Dogs is a classic.
I:9509;910;3/4 the special features from the 2.
I:9509;911;Quentin Tarantino jump starts his career with this exciting, funny drama about a jewel heist gone wrong.
I:9509;912;Unique, brilliant story telling style like no other.
I:9509;913;Us fans are definitely die hards.
I:9509;914;1992's Reservoir Dogs was an excellent start for Quentin Tarantino, who will later do two more impressive works of cinema, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown.
I:9509;915;Filmmaking was fresh and exciting once again with Reservoir Dogs, and Tarantino would follow his classic up with the breakthough masterpiece Pulp Fiction, a tagteam one.
I:9509;916;Like other movies, this had several flaws, but still a powerful, unique experience and the start of Tarantino's movie arsenal.
I:9509;917;i didn't see this movie when it debuted because I was too young to know about it at the time, but I agree, I've heard it around and seeing the movie myself justifies that it is cult classic.
I:9509;918;up credits sequence start it off with a bang.
I:9509;919;aliased characters and the backdrop 70's music are unforgettable.
I:9509;920;it's amazing how Tarantino interwines the right songs for the most interesting scenes in his movies.
I:9509;921;The focus on the characters was the beauty part.
I:9509;922;It was an inspirational start for many young directors, and had a big impact on the way movies were to be made in the 90's.
I:9509;923;This it one entertaining movie.
I:9509;924;The plot is great and the cast develops each character perfectly.
I:9509;925;there is a twist in it that will have many show.
I:9509;926;Great movie for any Tarantino fan.
I:9509;927;this film was perfectly cast.
I:9509;928;This film has it all and will grip you to your television from begining to end.
I:9509;929;The film is presented in wide and full screen.
I:9509;930;It was NOT that good.
I:9509;931;When I first saw this movie, I figured it was about a bunch of these mafia.
I:9509;932;This isn't one for the faint of heart, and it's sheer rawness makes it undeniably great.
I:9509;933;Watch this and experience the cult classic that is Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;934;This has to be 1of the best movies of all time.
I:9509;935;A great crime thriller told throught flashbacks of the various stars.
I:9509;936;"A brilliant, brutal heist film focusing on the before and after rather than the act itself, Tarantino's darkly funny ""Reservoir Dogs"" was the most auspicious debut of the 1990s, brought to life through the efforts of Keitel, who was impressed with the unconventional script."
I:9509;937;Great use of `70's period music as well.
I:9509;938;I like the film, the extras are pretty good, but something's very odd about the transfer?
I:9509;939;aside from that, it's a nice package.
I:9509;940;great Movie with extras in this anniversary edition.
I:9509;941;This is one of the best Quentin Tarrintino movies ever.
I:9509;942;It has great actors in he film.
I:9509;943;This is an allstar cast.
I:9509;944;All the acrors deliver a very powerful performance.
I:9509;945;This film has great lines in it and delivers some very funny dialogue.
I:9509;946;The action sequences are also done very well.
I:9509;947;The film is very suspenseful.
I:9509;948;Tarrintino's odd style of filming making this movie very cool.
I:9509;949;what also is cool about the film is how quentin shows you that it is okay to root for the bad guys.
I:9509;950;This is a classic and a movie everybody should have.
I:9509;951;Definately give this one a shot.
I:9509;952;I love gritty crime dramas and I wasn't dissappointed here.
I:9509;953;The writer definately did a good job.
I:9509;954;For example, Mr. White is a noble thief while Mr. Pink is a soullessly logical thief.
I:9509;955;Pay attention while you watch, and you'll notice their distinct personalities.
I:9509;956;A movie worth watching and re.
I:9509;957;I did not see it, but it must be real good if it's one of his favorites, so I recommend it as well.
I:9509;958;The acting's brilliant all around, and the script/dialogue is smart and natural and so, so funny it'll just kill you!
I:9509;959;there's never a boring moment and it's perfectly well directed.
I:9509;960;You'll enjoy the suspense in finding out who the rat is among the robbers.
I:9509;961;The main subjects: our stars.
I:9509;962;Raw acting and good performances all around, I would definately give it 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who can stomach it.
I:9509;963;A classic put out on blu ray.
I:9509;964;This is an outstanding film.
I:9509;965;generating movie machine, it is exciting to see that still there are good American directors with a full sense of what the movies should be and what mixed emotions the movies should generate on the public.
I:9509;966;tarantino was smart enough to reach new heights based on a very stringent budget .
I:9509;967;With a very strong, attractive set of dialogues, and with the help of a bunch of very talented actors.
I:9509;968;Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are at their best.
I:9509;969;The opening scene at the restaurant is superb, with smart and fine irony.
I:9509;970;The scene on which Mr. Blonde is engaged on the project is great.
I:9509;971;The scene on which names are given is also great.
I:9509;972;I remember saying to myself: Oh God, Please don't make him suffer any longer!
I:9509;973;definetely, one of the best American movies ever made.
I:9509;974;Quentin Tarantino's shocking but nevertheless fluid thriller set the stage for him to become one of America's most original directors.
I:9509;975;There is something compelling and original about all the violence and destruction in this film that separates it from other thrillers like it.
I:9509;976;It's hip and cool but it also has the same artistry that made The Killing such a successful film.
I:9509;977;Keitel is great and he has a good cast to give him back up.
I:9509;978;The language is coarse and bracingly authentic.
I:9509;979;everything the Amazons write about the movie is true, even though it is an old one: Vintage Tarrantino.
I:9509;980;Worth every penny, every minute.
I:9509;981;that was fifteen years ago and the amazing thing is that it is still going strong.
I:9509;982;The movie itself stands up beautifully, but the details and general.
I:9509;983;ness of it continue to amaze me.
I:9509;984;this is just a long way around to say that this movie has artistic legs that have carried it through almost twenty years now with amazing strength and that, in my opinion, it will continue to have relevance and artistic merit even after twenty more years have passed.
I:9509;985;Especially if you enjoyed pulp fiction.
I:9509;986;the story line is to keep one quessing and then it punches one right in the nose.
I:9509;987;the acting from all of the characters is super.
I:9509;988;the ending is unreal and sure tops the cork.
I:9509;989;one is totally focused on the characters with a few surprises along the way.
I:9509;990;i would watch again just to enjoy the acting taking place.
I:9509;991;This is a great Guy Film, to watch alone or with a buddy and, preferably, with a giant pizza and a few glasses of beer.
I:9509;992;It features a terrific dialogue.
I:9509;993;driven plot, a few enjoyable action scenes, and some great background music.
I:9509;994;It's an excellent story and is very compelling to watch.
I:9509;995;I can't believe it's 15 years old, but it still holds up.
I:9509;996;This is also a great transfer.
I:9509;997;Sure, the extras are a little lacking, but it's the film that matters and if you're looking to update your collection, this is a good bet.
I:9509;998;You take them for what they are and you run with it.
I:9509;999;That is what makes them special.
I:9509;1000;Time goes by and this movie is still incredible.
I:9509;1001;I am happy with the product.
I:9509;1002;This debut of Quentin Tarantino in the 10 years since it's release has become a cult film.
I:9509;1003;I on the other hand saw the film on its initial release and could only remember a decade later that I enjoyed the film, found it shockingly violent and knew that I would like to view it again.
I:9509;1004;The second look revealed the great humor, the unique time.
I:9509;1005;shuffling (which is surprisingly easy to follow), and the individuality of the anonymous characters, their unique personality traits, and their varied relationships with mostly strangers bound only by their profession.
I:9509;1006;rode my goal orientations and I was drawn to Mr. White rather than Mr. Orange.
I:9509;1007;The commentary is insightful, the professional reviews are revealing, details of how the film came to be made are enlightening, and trivia abounds.
I:9509;1008;"Not to be missed is Tarantino's hilarious tale of the events surrounding the initial screenings of the film at Sundance in 1992
I:9509;1009;You can renew your interest in who shot Nice Guy Eddie.
I:9509;1010;The new interviews with the actors portraying many of the vari.
I:9509;1011;captioning feature of my television.
I:9509;1012;This is a raw, gritty film shot in a manner to match the content.
I:9509;1013;It is a unique, riveting film that deserves to be seen in a new light or for the first time by anyone who considers themselves a fan of great cinema.
I:9509;1014;There is no better way to accomplish this feat than by purchasing the anniversary issue and immersing yourself in all facets of this film.
I:9509;1015;This is one Special Edition that truly deserves the description: 'Special'.
I:9509;1016;The cinematography in this film is superb!
I:9509;1017;The acting is right on and the story line is amazing!
I:9509;1018;It such a good action and gangster film!
I:9509;1019;Great story with realistic characters.
I:9509;1020;other than that, I loved the movie!
I:9509;1021;He has a way of always surrounding himself with outstanding acting talent, and it's often been said that everyone wants to be in his movies because of the freedom he gives the performers and his stunnning vision.
I:9509;1022;by far my favorite Tarantino flick, this is a total classic and was very inexpensive.
I:9509;1023;screen virtuoso displays of an indie enfant terrible, there is a subtlety of filmmaking and rich thematic development that emerges here and reaches fruition in the mature, less heavy.
I:9509;1024;It is worth noting the staged pieta that concludes the film, and the double.
I:9509;1025;rate filmmakers of this decade.
I:9509;1026;It reminded me of how much I enjoyed it the 1'st time I watched it.
I:9509;1027;That's all I have to say.
I:9509;1028;I will add my thoughts though.
I:9509;1029;What Tarantino has done is truly a masterpiece.
I:9509;1030;First of all, let me start off saying I love this movie with all my heart but, what's with the box set.
I:9509;1031;Quentin Tarantino's first major film is a very promising start for one of the most eccentric filmmakers of the last decade.
I:9509;1032;"the cast was great too
I:9509;1033;I can't give it 5 stars only because I've seen it once, but it is definitely worth watching.
I:9509;1034;and hearing young men in the audience laughing like it was a Woody Allen comedy.
I:9509;1035;Quentin tarantino at his best.
I:9509;1036;Great story and very suspenseful.
I:9509;1037;A great all around movie, though not for the kids .
I:9509;1038;It puts a new twist on the old cops and robbers theme.
I:9509;1039;If you like this, you'll also love Killing Zoe, Ronin, and Heat (this movie is in a class of its own).
I:9509;1040;This is the most viscious movie I've ever seen.
I:9509;1041;I thought that Pulp Fiction had some interesting and innovative elements, but was vastly overrated.
I:9509;1042;Now I have seen this, his earlier film, and it is even more overrated .
I:9509;1043;i think customer reviews are a wonderful idea .
I:9509;1044;Love all of Tarantino's flicks there is always good action mixed in with drugs, curse words, sex, and chases.
I:9509;1045;You gotta love Tarantino for his ability to combine extreme violence with humor.
I:9509;1046;The closing scene when all of the slime balls gun each other down is priceless.
I:9509;1047;It showcased his deceptively simplistic approach to his script, and his masterful non.
I:9509;1048;He plays a grizzled veteran at the heist game who is a fatherly.
I:9509;1049;reservoir Dogs is epic, if you can handle the subject matter.
I:9509;1050;One of the better movies of all time.
I:9509;1051;Funky visuals and subject matter beautifully manicured .
I:9509;1052;"Pulp Fiction is a good popcorn munching movie
I:9509;1053;So happy this is on AIV.
I:9509;1054;The ensemble cast is perfection.
I:9509;1055;this is one of the most awesome movies of all time.
I:9509;1056;, but what makes this film unique is in the way that it is handled.
I:9509;1057;I love the first scene where they are in the diner.
I:9509;1058;this is a line of conversation you might have with your friends at breakfast.
I:9509;1059;The acting is awesome, and everything seems so realistic.
I:9509;1060;listen to the dialogue, listen to the music, which is fantastic, kick back and enjoy.
I:9509;1061;They all dress in suits and never use their real names so as to keep their real identities hidden.
I:9509;1062;linear which really keeps it interesting and the movie really makes you keep on guessing about who the undercover cop is which is really good storytelling.
I:9509;1063;So overall an excellent plot that works very well in the film.
I:9509;1064;all of the actors do a stupendous job here in each of their roles.
I:9509;1065;Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White and does a great job at getting sympathy, professionalism, and the ability to do what is necessary without needing to be pushed.
I:9509;1066;He seems incredibly calm and professional around others but once they leave he really seems like a loon which means that he does a good job in his role.
I:9509;1067;Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange who is injured throughout the majority of the movie (all of the after the robbery scenes) and he works really well too with how someone would act when they are injured like that.
I:9509;1068;And we also have Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink who isn't crazy or very professional either but he is smart and plans everything out.
I:9509;1069;Just like everyone else in this movie he does his job perfectly.
I:9509;1070;So we have some excellent acting here from the entire cast.
I:9509;1071;when it comes down to the special effects they are quite good for the time period and budget with some very realistic looking injuries and wounds plus some great looking gunshots and just about everything else.
I:9509;1072;The music has a lot of 1970s songs in it and it works surprisingly well for the movie.
I:9509;1073;The soundtrack is iconic and memorable which really helps get the film off the ground.
I:9509;1074;overall, this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best film but it is still incredibly entertaining.
I:9509;1075;It is incredibly violent and has some very course language but if you can sit through all of that then you'll really see a skilled filmmaker just beginning to master the craft.
I:9509;1076;linear storytelling is rarely used in films which really keeps the audience thinking and with such an incredible story, stupendous acting, and some decent production values this one is worth a watch.
I:9509;1077;"Nothing enthralling about this unless you want to watch men argue about who could be the ""rat"" when the movie already tells you who it is."
I:9509;1078;This is an awesome movie, I already own it.
I:9509;1079;I bought it again because I wanted the collector's case, that looks like a gasoline container.
I:9509;1080;I new this was a good movie when I bought it, and I received what I expected.
I:9509;1081;It's one of my all time favorites and keeps you guessing until the very end.
I:9509;1082;Qeuntin Tarantino's crime classic Reservoir Dogs is eqaully hasgood and entertaining as Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1083;This film is a perfect example of great, modern, cinematic storytelling.
I:9509;1084;The entire film pulsates with energy, excitement and a sense of overwhelming interest.
I:9509;1085;It has developed a large cult following and I am proud to say that I am a member of that cult.
I:9509;1086;This film always holds a place on my favourite films list.
I:9509;1087;The film is mostly dialogue, with characters arguing, accusing and fighting with each other at any chance, but there are scenes of action as we see various characters making their getaway from the crime.
I:9509;1088;the acting is great with Tim Roth's performance being my personal favourite.
I:9509;1089;The rest of the cast is great too, especially Harvey Keital as Mr. White, Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink.
I:9509;1090;It has quite an ensemble cast but they are rarely all in a scene together.
I:9509;1091;"this is Tarantino's first film and it really shows his potential as a great modern director and, of course, ""Pulp Fiction"" confirmed it."
I:9509;1092;"I consider ""Reservoir Dogs"" to be the better of the two films though because it is more raw and more exciting than Fiction."
I:9509;1093;They are both great though and that is because of Tarantino.
I:9509;1094;He brings great energy to every scene and he certainly knows how to use the camera to help tell the story.
I:9509;1095;He also picks perfect music for the film.
I:9509;1096;"You will never be able to hear ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" the same after seeing this and ""Coconut"" ends the film on a perfect note."
I:9509;1097;a great film with a great cast and I recommend this to anybody who likes a good bit of storytelling.
I:9509;1098;I honestly love this movie!
I:9509;1099;"This movie is a true classic, and all you need to know if the line ""Why do I have to be Mr. Pink"" which has become used often (at least among many of the people I know and I have seen it in a commercial when visting a friend.)"
I:9509;1100;This is the movie that put Taratino on the scene and we are introduced to elements and themes he will use later on in his story telling as he piecces the items together of what went wrong.
I:9509;1101;Keitel, Buscemi and the others are just great.
I:9509;1102;The way the plot works itself out is ingenius, the suspense is second.
I:9509;1103;the entire movie unfolds as, really, a two hour dialogue between Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and Mr. White .
I:9509;1104;It comes with a fullscreen and widescreen edition, as well as lots of special editions: trailors, posters, picture galleries, etc.
I:9509;1105;One of the best values I have in my collection!
I:9509;1106;Fanally, after years of struggle, he breaks out with Reservoir Dogs, a smart and exciting look a strangers involved in a diamond heist.
I:9509;1107;Steve Buscemi, is quick and smart as mr. pink, adding always a little comic relief.
I:9509;1108;This Film, which I rate in my top 20 favorites, has never looked better.
I:9509;1109;The soundtrack is wonderful, and you can now catch all the words.
I:9509;1110;And those rotten 70's music soundtrack is perfect.
I:9509;1111;Quentin Taratino is a genius.
I:9509;1112;This is a great movie!
I:9509;1113;He seems to be able to discuss his ideas intelligently (and his insistence upon writing his own material tells me that he is not much interested in our disposable aesthetic of popular movie distribution) and he is much interested in film history (it seems).
I:9509;1114;I'm actually awaiting the time when Quentin abandons directing movies and starts to write more film literature works.
I:9509;1115;Because I think he is of more value as a historian.
I:9509;1116;He is going to be best at introducing moderns to the older ways of exploitation movies and cinema obscurities more so than he is mapping a new future for movies.
I:9509;1117;Reservoir Dogs is still a strong kick in the gut of a movie.
I:9509;1118;i really do enjoy it on some levels, but am repulsed by it more so on many others.
I:9509;1119;1 and 2, which to me represent the real 'follow.
I:9509;1120;Reservoir Dogs represents a clever bit of thievery and nasty.
I:9509;1121;minded dialogue that some call brilliant , and others call repulsive.
I:9509;1122;The performances are fine, but the content is tough to take in.
I:9509;1123;As stylish and as interesting as the mayhem can be at times, the picture as a whole is still rather empty (but there are a few good moments in here nonetheless).
I:9509;1124;I really liked the extras (including the great Tarantino interviews, and the cast interviews), and the multi.
I:9509;1125;slicing' scene is particularly interesting for film enthusiasts.
I:9509;1126;Tarantino, now very much rich and world famous, has been given an amount of power which he can use to further cinema history studies and build a deeper enthusiasm for more unusual (and exploitation) cinema.
I:9509;1127;I hope that he one day makes his mature masterpiece before he retires to focus upon writing alone.
I:9509;1128;This 1992 film by Quentin Tarantino is creative, brilliant and has the force of a bullet at high speed.
I:9509;1129;Their real names are secrets.
I:9509;1130;the actual opening scene of the film is with Harvey Keitel driving a car with a wounded Tim Roth in the back seat.
I:9509;1131;There is much confrontation, more bloodshed.
I:9509;1132;the dialog is fast and brilliant.
I:9509;1133;The flashbacks are quick and come at just the right time to enrich the story.
I:9509;1134;But it's the character development that is what is really important.
I:9509;1135;The acting is uniformly terrific.
I:9509;1136;These extras were enjoyable, interesting and enriched my experience of the film.
I:9509;1137;this is a groundbreaking work with the hint of genius.
I:9509;1138;I therefore highly recommend this film for anyone not afraid of copious amounts of make.
I:9509;1139;One of my favorite movies.
I:9509;1140;Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job for a first.
I:9509;1141;Madsen is actually a decent looking guy with amazing blue eyes.
I:9509;1142;and, probably most importantly, I noticed how Tarantino uses language to great effect in Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;1143;He also has a black boss who he respects.
I:9509;1144;overall, it's a great film.
I:9509;1145;I am happy I saw it young, before I saw all the films it influenced, so that it still felt fresh and innovative.
I:9509;1146;Classic Tarantino movie with what has now become the default dream.
I:9509;1147;team cast of such things.
I:9509;1148;I have to say this man is a genius.
I:9509;1149;The whole idea of the robbery and the using of colors as names was pure genius.
I:9509;1150;You take my advice rememeber what happened in this movie and I promise you, you'll feel better.
I:9509;1151;Stop reading this scroll up and hit play and watch a damn good movie.
I:9509;1152;This initial release is subpar at best due to the non.
I:9509;1153;I definitely could not out guess it I liked that aspect very much movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I:9509;1154;this is not only a good crime/gangster flick, but it is also a fantastic drama of psychological proportions!
I:9509;1155;this is the best example of a modern classic!
I:9509;1156;great cast, great story, great movie!
I:9509;1157;The movie has quite a cast and lot of real dialogue about nothing.
I:9509;1158;But the energy in this film is amazing .
I:9509;1159;The standout performance in this one is Harvey Keitel ( Red Dragon, Little Nicky, The Piano)and Tim Roth (Planet Of The Apes, Pulp Fiction, The Musketeer)This is not for the whole family and only for those who can get into some graphic violence and language that you would literally only hear in the streets.
I:9509;1160;I liked it but I do have my reservations.
I:9509;1161;The cast is phenomenal, especially Tim Roth and Daniel Baldwin.
I:9509;1162;Quentin Tarantino is a legend.
I:9509;1163;Probably my favorite producer nexts to the man James Cameron.
I:9509;1164;Excellent special features, an ingenious package that make remember to mr. Blonde in action.
I:9509;1165;This motion picture are part of my list of top ten favorites , high recommendable, two thumbs up!!!
I:9509;1166;Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's best, in my opinion, even though I know many people will contest this affirmation.
I:9509;1167;With all its awesome acting, especially from Harvey Keitel, its excellent twists and non conventional situations, it's the best film of its kind.
I:9509;1168;And that's perfect, because the humor in Pulp Fiction was there to seem cool.
I:9509;1169;The scenario is pretty well written, even though the use of the F. word is excessive.
I:9509;1170;because of its intensity, and of course, realism.
I:9509;1171;so the criminals suspect one of them for being a cop.
I:9509;1172;because it is funny, in some way.
I:9509;1173;and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a pretty good movie too.
I:9509;1174;Overall, great acting, interesting and surprising story twists, fine directing, and a very good movie.
I:9509;1175;What I had remembered were the names(Mr Pink, Mr Orange, etc), the crime, the Ear Scene and the amazing dialogue from the Diner Scene .
I:9509;1176;ResDogs is now one of our Family Movies ( we have a film fan family of sorts) and has earned a spot on my Top 10 as well.
I:9509;1177;This is an absolutely amazing, ground breaking film and I adored it!
I:9509;1178;Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker)One of those eight men is a traitor .
I:9509;1179;For a majority of them this is the last day of their lives.
I:9509;1180;the twists of the scenario are another trick Tarantino used to the maximum.
I:9509;1181;And that it is a rare, precious thing in modern cinema.
I:9509;1182;this film had of course descendants even if, thanks God, nobody had the brilliant idea to make a sequel, prequel or spin.
I:9509;1183;First, because it is a masterpiece and second, because it changed the history of cinema.
I:9509;1184;I loved this movie its well acted,directed,and written some people mite not like it because of the violence and profinity it can get pretty extrem towards the end of the movie.
I:9509;1185;There was plenty of online debate when the disc came out as to the worth of it.
I:9509;1186;This new transfer remedies all of that, the picture is anamorphic, with rich colors, making the film look exactly like what I saw when I used to watch it in the 90s.
I:9509;1187;The 10th edition has a documentary interviewing most of the key players in the film as well as some priceless footage from Tarantino's filmmaking lab workshops at Sundance where he (poorly) played Mr. White(!)
I:9509;1188;There are a couple of retrospective documentaries discussing the film's impact on the cinema world.
I:9509;1189;core fan of the film, especially with the superior transfer.
I:9509;1190;Oh, and if you're into packaging, this is the best packaging I've ever seen.
I:9509;1191;To a degree amateurish, but to an equal degree compelling and original, Reservoir Dogs is a stylistic, gritty look at the gangsters of Quentin Tarantino's imagination.
I:9509;1192;The strong points, however, are many.
I:9509;1193;"Each character has a terrific, interesting voice
I:9509;1194;Pulp Fiction is superior in every respect, but it's a treat to see its progenitor.
I:9509;1195;Resevior dogs is a great film.
I:9509;1196;The dialogue is whitty, hte scenes are well shot, and the whole film oozes with style.
I:9509;1197;Still it's a great film and one that is definatly worth seeing.
I:9509;1198;It's just the way we talk to each other.
I:9509;1199;The way Pulp Fiction was funny.
I:9509;1200;First of all, I agree with some of the other reviewers with regards to the casting and the editing of the movie.
I:9509;1201;Superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi.
I:9509;1202;Overall, I found it to be an good debut by Tarantino.
I:9509;1203;"As far as I'm concerned, ""Pulp Fiction"" was his first big break, and the best thing he did until the Kill Bill series."
I:9509;1204;The Reservoir Dogs changed the way of gangster films of the 90's forever,and is the best right next to Pulp Fiction,and the plot can be confusing but still understandable.
I:9509;1205;Very good film, being Quentin Tarantino's film debut.
I:9509;1206;The director himself makes a few apperances as Mr. Brown.
I:9509;1207;I can't imagine what goes on in Quentin Tarantino's mind but the outcome is always pure gold.
I:9509;1208;it's is amazing how he develops characters in only a few minutes of dialog.
I:9509;1209;I absolutely love this movie.
I:9509;1210;It has great actors as well as a good amount of action.
I:9509;1211;What makes the movie is the interpersonal dialogue, and how SANE and CLEAR everyones thought process is.
I:9509;1212;Tarantino proved himself a true genius of cinema by making up an arbitrary topic and having his characters discuss it in an often times hilarious manner.
I:9509;1213;By having all these criminals discuss simple topics like the true meaning of Madonna's song Like a Virgin , Tarantino gives these characters a touch of humanity that has never existed in any film preceding it.
I:9509;1214;the film is a tremendous accomplishment by a first time director and while not on par with Tarantino's other masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs certainly is in a league of its own.
I:9509;1215;The dialogue is so unforgettable linked with the music that I can remember every scene and most of the lines.
I:9509;1216;The Actors were superb and had a connection rarely achieved in real life, let alone a movie.
I:9509;1217;The most successful Independant Film Production of all time for a reason.
I:9509;1218;Just a great action crime movie.
I:9509;1219;As I said great crime flick gritty and real.
I:9509;1220;This is one of the best movies ever seen, this is just my opinion.
I:9509;1221;The alternate takes of the ear scene make it almost worth the price itself.
I:9509;1222;At times their stories are funny and amusing.
I:9509;1223;This is a must have for any fans of great movies out there
I:9509;1224;And I really enjoyed seeing that movie but when a few years later I discovered this movie was a carbon copy of the HONG KONG movie CITY ON FIRE (starring Chow.Yun Fat) which was made in late 80's/early 90'S, I felt cheated.
I:9509;1225;Don't get me wrong, I still love RESERVOIR DOGS but I love it because of its narration.
I:9509;1226;Awesome effort by all involved.
I:9509;1227;the plot of the movie is pretty basic: A group of guys team up together under a crime boss and plan to rob a bank to get their hands on some priceless diamonds.
I:9509;1228;Harvey Kietel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, and other big name actors enter this movie and each one in my opinion is a great actor.
I:9509;1229;These actors are so well in this movie that you can feel the emotion that their onscreen counterparts are potraying and it's very refreshing to see such good actors in this movie.
I:9509;1230;so if you're a fan of other Tarantino movies then by all means pick this one up.
I:9509;1231;Well written, and worth watching if you can handle this type of movie.
I:9509;1232;Such a sleek and stylish build of characters in an intense supercharged plot of a bank heist gone horribly wrong.
I:9509;1233;and the detail of what happens to each member and how their distrust of each other spirals out of control is edge.
I:9509;1234;seat terrific!Full of classic Taratino lines.
I:9509;1235;Although the only problem with the film is that Tarantino is in it and at the beginning gives one of his typical self indulgent idiotic monologues Once you get past that the movie is a gem!
I:9509;1236;Better than Pulp Fiction at times.
I:9509;1237;It's gory, it's well written, it's twisted, and o yah, it's gory.
I:9509;1238;the story line in this flick makes it one of his best.
I:9509;1239;The creativity used in unfolding the story is so unique that this movie gets stuck in your head for years to come.
I:9509;1240;Certainly one of the top ten robbery movies ever made.
I:9509;1241;the acting is phenomenal as well.
I:9509;1242;Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi give performances that are worthy of awards.
I:9509;1243;Quentin does a good job limit his role as well.
I:9509;1244;from the opening scene to the closing scene you're constantly entertained.
I:9509;1245;A lot of twists and turns in plot.
I:9509;1246;I remember alot of great directing shots, but there's nothing to really look into.
I:9509;1247;But this is an entertaining film, and I recommend it to Quentin Tarantino fans.
I:9509;1248;Anything by Quentin T. is definitely worth a look.
I:9509;1249;This movie was wild, crazy and over the top!
I:9509;1250;If you watch it, you`re in for a wild ride!!!!!!!
I:9509;1251;Reservoir Dogs is another one of my favorite movies.
I:9509;1252;Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.
I:9509;1253;Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue.
I:9509;1254;Because the characters talk like real people.
I:9509;1255;In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing.
I:9509;1256;His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.
I:9509;1257;Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role.
I:9509;1258;But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie.
I:9509;1259;The picture is remastered in high definition, which really makes it clear.
I:9509;1260;Ten times better than the other version.
I:9509;1261;The sound is also much, MUCH better.
I:9509;1262;budget film, the movie looks and sounds amazing.
I:9509;1263;and there are tons and TONS of extras that will keep you more than happy.
I:9509;1264;Way too many for me to list, but the ones I liked the most were the interviews.
I:9509;1265;That has to be one of the funniest interviews I have ever seen.
I:9509;1266;Just trust me and watch it!
I:9509;1267;This is one of my favorites, and proves just how talented Quentin Tarantino is when it comes to writing and directing.
I:9509;1268;I also checked the hyperlink and re.
I:9509;1269;After the success of 1994's Pulp Fiction , Quentin Tarantino fans scrambled around to find Reservoir Dogs .
I:9509;1270;rated director who cobbled together a decent story for Pulp Fiction , and was lucky to not butcher jackie brown , which was based on a good Elmore Leonard novel.
I:9509;1271;Does anyone honestly care what happens to these guys?A better question is this.
I:9509;1272;of course, I've since seen a lot more movies, including Tarantino's most recent Kill Bill series.
I:9509;1273;Indeed, the actors must, you know, ACT and tell us the story that we don't see on screen.
I:9509;1274;we never see the actual bank heist, which is part of the fun.
I:9509;1275;things are complicated by Mr. White's loyalty to Mr. Orange, who has been shot in the stomach.
I:9509;1276;A thief with honor, Mr. White treats Mr. Orange like his child, and it's only through deleted scenes that we discover Mr. White has been horribly betrayed before.
I:9509;1277;It is a tribute to Roth's acting ability that he makes it look so painful.
I:9509;1278;And through it all, Mr. White does his level best to save Mr. Orange, a man he barely knows.
I:9509;1279;The final twist in the end reveals who played who and in Shakespearean fashion leaves just about everybody dead.
I:9509;1280;the acting in the movie is superb.
I:9509;1281;Keitel, who produced the movie, knew what he was getting into and is the star of the show.
I:9509;1282;He expresses a full range here, from that of a sniggering thug to a fatherly protector to a weeping brother.
I:9509;1283;Madsen is cool as ice and puts his cold.
I:9509;1284;speak, see Uma Thurman in Kill Bill).
I:9509;1285;Still, the dialogue is engaging and amusing, and it established a distinct narrative voice that has marked all of Tarantino's films.
I:9509;1286;It is Quentin Tarantino's true best film and has excellent talent.
I:9509;1287;You have to wade through the rough language, but the movie is such a classic of its genre that it should be watched.
I:9509;1288;It was just a good film.
I:9509;1289;There are some flaws within the story but otherwise it's solid.
I:9509;1290;The dialogue is great, the characters are interesting.
I:9509;1291;It's definitely the underrated film of Tarantino's career
I:9509;1292;Aside for this movie being so great, the special edition is awesome.
I:9509;1293;This is very smart and helpful for people with no wide screen TV sets.
I:9509;1294;The asset I liked the most was the deluxe packaging remembering the galon of gas that Mr. Blonde tried to use over the captured policeman.
I:9509;1295;In addition, inside beautiful discs into a matches digi pack look and feel.
I:9509;1296;Its a decent movie and story, however its Quite Confusing, as it goes Back and Forth.
I:9509;1297;I enjoyed it, but think its a Bit Overrated.
I:9509;1298;Must have for anyone who love action movies.
I:9509;1299;This is worth the movie over and over again.
I:9509;1300;If you love Tarrintino his movies are always amazing on Blu Ray.
I:9509;1301;This is without a doubt, one of the best movies i've seen.
I:9509;1302;Now that the kids got me started, I'm very impressed.
I:9509;1303;I'm not a movie critic, and these are some great stories.
I:9509;1304;bad edition,but good movie though!
I:9509;1305;tarantino is one of the greates film writers that we have today and his talent really show with this script.
I:9509;1306;the dialoge is fast paced yet perfectly timed the camera movements are fluid yet interesting and the characters are classic of course who can forget Mr. Blonde in the scene involving the cop and his ear (those who have seen this film know the scene I mean)with the violence over the top and the profanity at the max this has to be one of the greatest films of all time.
I:9509;1307;The majority of the film involves introducing us to the characters and showing how they came to be involved, as well as flashbacks and flashforwards taking us through the day to watch the events unfold.
I:9509;1308;Reservoir Dogs marked the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and I must say that it has to be one of the best film debuts that I have ever seen.
I:9509;1309;The cast picked for this film was absolutely perfect.
I:9509;1310;They all offer outstanding performances, and the film could not have succeeded without them.
I:9509;1311;The main reason this film succeeds, is that it shows what ordinary crime films keep out .
I:9509;1312;The soundtrack to this movie is outstanding as well, and each song used fits each scene perfectly.
I:9509;1313;overall, this is one of the best crime films that I have ever seen.
I:9509;1314;The film is shot brilliantly taking us back and forth over the day of the robbery.
I:9509;1315;This provides for tons of violence, a hard to solve mystery, and outstanding dialogue between the characters.
I:9509;1316;Now you get deleted scenes, interviews with all of the cast, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, and much more.
I:9509;1317;I know people who loved it, and if you enjoy the genre, it's as good as it gets.
I:9509;1318;this is a fun movie, and when i ordered it it was six bucks.
I:9509;1319;Honestly, this is a pretty good movie, but the interviews are better.
I:9509;1320;Tarantino tells one of the funniest stories you could ever imagine about the old actor who died shortly after the movie.
I:9509;1321;Simply one of the best movies ever!
I:9509;1322;Quentin Tarantino is one helluva director/writer/actor.
I:9509;1323;Nothing but great dialogues, great acting and a great plot.
I:9509;1324;Oh wait, it's got a great soundtrack too.
I:9509;1325;A very black and clever movie with fantastic acting from the entire cast and brilliant scripting and directing from Tarantino.
I:9509;1326;Reservoir Dogs is a thoroughly entertaining and gripping movie that I would have to reccomend unconditionally to any Action movie fan.
I:9509;1327;It's intense throughout, as soon as the opening credits are over the grisly reality of a foiled robbery begins and Quentin Tarantino leads us on a suberb ride trying to find out who the rat in the Dogs is.
I:9509;1328;All play there roles with intensity and enthusiasm unmatched in any Action film of it's time.
I:9509;1329;They all do a extremely fine job in the ending, with Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth putting in a splendid performance.
I:9509;1330;this movie is a landmark in Crime films and is the film by which all other Crime films that followed should be judged upon.
I:9509;1331;A classic, in every aspect.
I:9509;1332;The best characters in the movie Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) Mr. Blonde(Michael Madsen) I have always liked him and Steve.
I:9509;1333;"As in Pulp Fiction the dialogue is fantastic and is really what makes the movie great
I:9509;1334;among tarantino's works definitely worth owning along with pulp fiction and true romance (screenplay).
I:9509;1335;It is a twisted film as well.
I:9509;1336;Has a really dramatic ending.
I:9509;1337;This movie is an excellent film Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and ground breaking film that pushed independent films into the main stream.
I:9509;1338;with the help of his son Nice guy eddie they want to pull off the job of a lifetime.
I:9509;1339;the movie just gets crazier and crazier as the movie goes on with a heratbreaking and startling ending.
I:9509;1340;this movie is a gripping tale that shows there is no loyalty among criminals.
I:9509;1341;this is one of the best crime films.
I:9509;1342;best films period, that I have ever seen.
I:9509;1343;The film is shot in a incredible way taking us back and forth over the day of the robbery and The planning of the robbery.
I:9509;1344;This provides the viewer with alot of violence, a difficult to solve mystery, and outstanding dialogue between the characters and outstanding performances by the actors.
I:9509;1345;what gripped me about this movie is how real his performance is , harvey kietel gives a heartbreaking incredible performance as well.
I:9509;1346;Kietel is one of the greatest film actors ever.
I:9509;1347;Had to be a cheap movie to make, but it is very entertaining and well written by the master Q. t.
I:9509;1348;Reservoir Dogs holds to the hallmarks of solid drama and dialogue.
I:9509;1349;driven plot so well, that this movie could easily transfer over into an enthralling play.
I:9509;1350;what are the criminals going to do now.
I:9509;1351;makes the speech of the characters all the more gripping.
I:9509;1352;Because if you listen carefully to the words of Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue and the other criminals, you actually hear introspective dialogue.
I:9509;1353;as you can see, Reservoir Dogs offers an encyclopedia of ways to study this one film.
I:9509;1354;I wish more films were made with the utter cinematic genius and simplicity that Tarantino used here.
I:9509;1355;I applaud the art form Tarantino has put forth and hope that other daring filmmakers and directors will make all and more of the cinematic heresies that he did.
I:9509;1356;"write ventures to serve up ""Reservoir Dogs"" at the local Shakespeare theater, I will most certainly come and delight in this mesmerizing display of intrepid directing and competent acting and would advise you to do likewise."
I:9509;1357;Say what you will about Pulp Fiction being Quentin Tarantino's finest film, and then forget everything you think about that once you lay eyes on Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;1358;I got this movie because it was very cheap and I really liked it, Tarantino is great, the package was a bit too big!!!
I:9509;1359;Quentin Tarantino is a director that brings real life violence to the big screen.
I:9509;1360;This is his first film and I have to say, bravo.
I:9509;1361;It is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten.
I:9509;1362;That's what made this film so great.
I:9509;1363;Add together the elements of Quentin's ear for dialogue, a wonderful cast, great acting, and unforgettable scenes of ultra.
I:9509;1364;violence and you have a film that you'll talk about long after having seen and experienced it.
I:9509;1365;It pays homage to them, yes, but it also has a contemporary feel to it.
I:9509;1366;the movie is really fast.
I:9509;1367;And it also takes place mainly in a garage.
I:9509;1368;It's almost like Mean Streets (best film ever), and the acting is superb.
I:9509;1369;Lawrence Tierney has the best role ever, and acts it out like a true pro would.
I:9509;1370;Six perfect killers are hired to pull of the single perfect diamond heist.
I:9509;1371;Quentin Tarantino's first and possibly best movie to date.
I:9509;1372;Includes the infamous ear scene, Steve Buschemi's convincing lecture about tipping, and award worthy performances by both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth.
I:9509;1373;It's wonderful that he finally got this chance to direct a film the way he wanted.
I:9509;1374;It's not part of the original movie but fun nonetheless.
I:9509;1375;everyone that reviews a movie should actually put thought into the review.
I:9509;1376;What you are telling a possible viewer is that this film is deserving of the lowest possible rating available.
I:9509;1377;Keep it to yourself and quite watching films because you obviously do not understand film making or the industry.
I:9509;1378;I hope next time you think about what you are watching a film and planning to write a review.
I:9509;1379;the intricate story of the film involves a jewelry heist gone wrong.
I:9509;1380;The originality factor of the film strikes when the audience learns, early on in the film, that the men do not, in actuallity, know each other so as if any of them get caught the rest of them are safe.
I:9509;1381;good so far?Now, QT likes to direct films based on stories that are more interesting when taken out of context .
I:9509;1382;Flashbacks occur quite often, and in this movie, they occur for the sake of introducing the cast through who they REALLY are.
I:9509;1383;sooner or later, the someone's a snitch approach hits the screen and everything hits the fan.
I:9509;1384;At this point, the film should concern itself with the style and approach to solving the caper.
I:9509;1385;needless to say, the movie includes trademark graphic violence, artful cinematography, and moments of pathos.
I:9509;1386;conscious, full of dialogue both relevant and random.
I:9509;1387;The recognizable cast fit their roles perfectly, from Michael Madsen as the crazy Mr. Blonde to Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie, son of big shot Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney).
I:9509;1388;reservoir Dogs is recommended viewing for Tarantino fans and one of his funniest and most emotional pieces.
I:9509;1389;This is one of the best movies of all time in my opinion.
I:9509;1390;Quentin's first remains one of his best, even better than Jackie Brown.
I:9509;1391;Interesting dialogue, great acting, cool camera work and an intriguing plot.
I:9509;1392;"But you have to get the anniversary edition
I:9509;1393;All Tarantino dialogues sound like something a high school kid came up with.
I:9509;1394;This film actually involed the audience this time, and asked them to think.
I:9509;1395;This is a great movie and enjoy watching it.
I:9509;1396;The extras aren't that great either, but I'd still recommend getting this on blu ray.
I:9509;1397;the movie keeps entertained the whole time and you don't even see the heist, and again, the story.
I:9509;1398;telling really adds more enjoyment.
I:9509;1399;A great movie, ever present on the shelf of a fan of movies.
I:9509;1400;But the package is pretty basic.
I:9509;1401;Harvey Keitel is a dynamic force, but he only achieves his best performances when the director or fellow actors in ensemble help him bring out his humanity and restrain his macho tendencies.
I:9509;1402;But putting this fact aside and judging only the movie, not the man behind the cameras, you'll see this is a good movie, although violent and exaggerated.
I:9509;1403;The acting is very good, the budget is low (and this is a merit for Tarantino).
I:9509;1404;This and pulp fiction are his best.
I:9509;1405;The cast is soo cool.
I:9509;1406;Great dialouge as is usual with tarantino movies.
I:9509;1407;Tarantinos direction is top notch for the most part, occasionaly bad camera placement but the movie is still amazing.
I:9509;1408;Plus everything is just cool in this movie.
I:9509;1409;Lots of dark humor interspersed as well.
I:9509;1410;Overall one of the 90's best and most innovative films.
I:9509;1411;Every performance is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi as the 'professional' Mr. Pink.
I:9509;1412;Quentin Tarantino makes the best debut by a dirctor in a long time, and the fact that he also scripted it just adds to his brilliance.
I:9509;1413;This is the remastered version with special features, commentaries, etc. etc.,.
I:9509;1414;great gangster/robber/bad cop/undercover cop movie.
I:9509;1415;Tarantino is entertaining for another generation at our house.
I:9509;1416;One of the best movies of the generation.
I:9509;1417;A must see for everyone who loves movies.
I:9509;1418;Great performance by all of the actors
I:9509;1419;This is a very cool movie hard to follow at the beginning but when they go back to the rest of the characters and tells the story of how they got to be part of the team.
I:9509;1420;It was a great moive.
I:9509;1421;Quentin Tarnatino's directrorial debut shines with inspiring wit and pulse pounding suspense, as this story of 6 robbers involved in a messed up diamond heist.
I:9509;1422;The action becomes more intense as they realize they have a police informant within the group.
I:9509;1423;This stands out from most modern day action films because it has it's own unique style of story telling, and the blood and action isn't gratuitous or just there for flash.
I:9509;1424;I would recommend this title for any fan of good movies, and good dialogue.
I:9509;1425;The movie, of course, was excellent, as it was when it was released.
I:9509;1426;What a way to start off one of the most intelligent and best scriptwriters and directors of the past two decades.
I:9509;1427;The way that Tarantino sets the film in the rendez vous, where other films would only give this section 5 or 10 minutes, is genius.
I:9509;1428;The script is sharp, the paranioa and the secrecy inside the gang is electrifying.
I:9509;1429;Their are also some possible career best performances from Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel.
I:9509;1430;SSimply, this is one of the best films ever made.
I:9509;1431;Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs is a brilliantly written, unique film that paved the way for Mr. Tarantino's breakthrough film, Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1432;Mr. Tarantino has keen eye for detail and the opening scene in a diner in which the crooks are discussing everything from what Madonna meant in her song Like A Virgin to 70's songs to tipping contains some of the sharpest dialogue in years.
I:9509;1433;Mr. Tarantino also uses music to great effect and he overlays scenes with the voice of comedian Steven Wright as host of a radio show K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's.
I:9509;1434;Reservoir Dogs is a tremendous debut film and introduced Mr. Tarantino as a force.
I:9509;1435;The extras are good, but just the overall better sound and picture is worth purchasing this version if you already own the first.
I:9509;1436;It was a great movie cause look what i rated it.
I:9509;1437;Ask me i thought it was gross, but a great movie.
I:9509;1438;To me this is one of the most memorable set of characters in cinema history.
I:9509;1439;Because they all played off each other so well in this movie.
I:9509;1440;All this makes for a very interesting movie that puts the viewers nerves on end and eyes glued to the screen.
I:9509;1441;While this is by no means a comedy film it does spare us a few moments where we can safely crack a smile.
I:9509;1442;All in all this is an excellent film with great acting and enough quick witted dialogue to last as long as the length of the movie, and then some.
I:9509;1443;On the other hand if you don't mind, then I recommend this movie to anyone who's got about an hour or two to blow.
I:9509;1444;Starting the movie with a pleasant conversation about the Madonna song 'Like A Virgin' and Mr. Pink's views on tipping at a resteraunt then going straight into the bloody massacre that occurs after a robbery goes wrong, this movie gets your attention from start to finish.
I:9509;1445;The concept of having flashbacks explaining character backgrounds or scenes from the robbery add greatly to the effectiveness of this movie.
I:9509;1446;With a well executed plot and the great acting, this is one that will be remembered.
I:9509;1447;Quentin Tarantino popped out of nowhere to become one of Hollywood's best directors.
I:9509;1448;This was the film he first introduced the world to.
I:9509;1449;I'll let you watch the movie.
I:9509;1450;It is a bloody film though, I'll tell you that.
I:9509;1451;quentin Tarantino is famous for using loads of dialogue in films, and the dialogue in this is quite cool.
I:9509;1452;i thought the characters were cool, with the likes of Mr White, a very cool guy, a bit tuff, but cool.
I:9509;1453;Mr orange, a bit soft, young but cool.
I:9509;1454;Mr Blond, a complete psycho, but very cool.
I:9509;1455;Mr Pink, a bit irratating, yes cool.
I:9509;1456;And Nice Guy Eddie, starnge guy, goes from nice to horrid, not so cool.
I:9509;1457;The actors who played these guys were great.
I:9509;1458;Quentin always knows who's best for his roles.
I:9509;1459;Michael Madsen plays Mr Blond, he's a great actor and he makes the character scary.
I:9509;1460;well he's only in about five minutes of the film.
I:9509;1461;so, a great film all together.
I:9509;1462;This movie is a close second to Pulp Fiction on the best Tarantino movies.
I:9509;1463;The dialogue in this movie is top notch, as is always common in Tarantino films.
I:9509;1464;If you haven't seen this I don't know why you haven't it is a five star tour de force.
I:9509;1465;I say serious, because most of his films always have a sense of irony and humor under evry theme.
I:9509;1466;It is also very hard to view at times (more or less because of what you don't see, as oposed to what you do see), yet it is always very striking and potent.
I:9509;1467;Violence is glamorized, but it is also given as a very realistic fact of society.
I:9509;1468;The film does seem to drag towards the end, but it still is a very excellent debut from an obviously promising director.
I:9509;1469;Tarantino has written and directed a minor masterpiece.
I:9509;1470;Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn are equally effective in their roles.
I:9509;1471;Even the voice of Stephen Wright as the radio DJ is perfect.
I:9509;1472;It's hard to believe that a debut film by an unknown (at the time) director could pack this much wallop and star power.
I:9509;1473;'Pulp Fiction' is a great film but it still can't match this one for sheer power and energy.
I:9509;1474;Two formats, great sound, and extra goodies makes it a worthwhile addition to your collection.
I:9509;1475;Soon after, Tarantino's other films such as True Romance, and especially Pulp Fiction, put his films on the map of must see movies.
I:9509;1476;The dialogue, the directing, the plethora of memorable and classic scenes, etc.
I:9509;1477;the witty dialog never seems to stop.
I:9509;1478;wrong movie with great characters and star performances check this one out.
I:9509;1479;This is an intelligent cross between mobster and typical gangster movies.
I:9509;1480;Unlike many where the people are too drunk, stoned or incompetent, this is much more realistic.
I:9509;1481;The cinematography and editing are great.
I:9509;1482;The sound is great, especially the soundtrack.
I:9509;1483;Probably in the top 50 of my 2000+ films, perhaps in top 25.
I:9509;1484;I loved the overall style of the film and thought Tarantino did great with the budget he had.
I:9509;1485;One of my top ten favorite flicks.
I:9509;1486;I love movies that take a simple story and turn it into great entertainment.
I:9509;1487;(Q. t.'s the master) Micheal Madson, in my veiw, is what really made this movie great.
I:9509;1488;The ear scene, with that great background song, is one of the best ten minutes of film I have ever seen.
I:9509;1489;one of best Tarantino movies yet, well written, directed and superb entertainment.
I:9509;1490;aside from that words can't truly describe keep up the good work sir,
I:9509;1491;First let me set this clear this a great movie but i ordered this new off of amazon and when i first got it i thought it was new but once i took off the plastic wrapping and stickers the case looked smudged and used.
I:9509;1492;Watch if your a Tarantino fan.
I:9509;1493;Movie keeps you in suspense every second.
I:9509;1494;So Joe assigns each team member a name, Mr. White, Mr. Black, Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue.
I:9509;1495;This film, in terms of script, dialog, casting, acting,and the level of violence and dark humor set an entirely new standard for gangster movies that followed and I still see it's imprint on movies today.
I:9509;1496;I also love the parallels and associations between this movie and Tarrintino's later films.
I:9509;1497;The Vega brothers, Tim Roth in the diner and the always impeccable Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi.
I:9509;1498;Also a special shout out to a great performance by Lawrence Tierney.
I:9509;1499;It makes you think while keeping you very entertained.
I:9509;1500;Considering that it only had a budget of $900,000 they did a darn good job.
I:9509;1501;We have some great sequences, great performances, a little bit of violence, and a lot of blood.
I:9509;1502;This is a large improvement from the original release.
I:9509;1503;The covers are kinda neat too, and it doesn't matter which one you get.
I:9509;1504;You should also see: Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Jackie Brown.
I:9509;1505;hero, gory gangster movies, you'll love this.
I:9509;1506;This movie was recommended by a friend as one of the best movies of all time .
I:9509;1507;Though the structure of the story is somewhat unique, there are better techniques for telling this story.
I:9509;1508;One of the best Tarantino movies .
I:9509;1509;right up there with Pulp Fiction but without the parallel universe story.
I:9509;1510;Buscemi rocks the house here as well.
I:9509;1511;The product was shipped very fast and in perfect working condition.
I:9509;1512;It came new and sealed as if I bought it straight from the store.
I:9509;1513;Big time Tarantino fan a classic styling plot is ever shifting good raw gritty styling.
I:9509;1514;One of my favorites from this director.
I:9509;1515;Even though I sometimes dislike the time jumping that Quentin uses in his flicks, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this storyunfold.
I:9509;1516;Great cast, couldn't have picked them better myself.
I:9509;1517;Must see in my book!
I:9509;1518;quentino is an awesome writer, director, never been anything short of happy with any of hus flicks, a must see
I:9509;1519;The dialog in this movie is top notch.
I:9509;1520;Steve Buscemi is great as Mr. Pink.
I:9509;1521;opera prima of Tarantino, mix dialogues with soundtrack and unknow supporting actors.
I:9509;1522;the best final scene ever.
I:9509;1523;RESERVOIR DOGS is a classic movie.
I:9509;1524;"Right around the same time that every home in America seemed to have a VCR, these ""little"" movies came out, tacking daring subjects in a daring manner."
I:9509;1525;And while they got little attention in traditional movie.
I:9509;1526;Cool camera moves and great use of music.
I:9509;1527;Cool male actors encouraged to yell and overact.
I:9509;1528;Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are all great actors, and they're pretty darn memorable in this film.
I:9509;1529;Therefore, I still say it's a classic, BUT, not always a classic that thrills with repeated viewings.
I:9509;1530;PULP FICTION, all these years later, still tickles me and excites me.
I:9509;1531;however, if you HAVEN'T seen it, I still recommend that you do!
I:9509;1532;Could have been a great film but I had to take stars away because of these two items.
I:9509;1533;Quentin Tarantino may be the most overrated filmmaker of the last forty years .
I:9509;1534;The plus of the film is a decent ensemble cast that could have been given so much more with a script that had more character development and less blood and gore.
I:9509;1535;A more talented filmmaker, like the great Martin Scorsese or Stanley Kubrick, could have made this a good film.
I:9509;1536;As it stands, it has moments of interest but the blood.
I:9509;1537;Reservoir Dogs is tarantinos best film.
I:9509;1538;It tells the story about a perfect robbery by a perfect gang wich has the leadings of harvie ketel,Tarantino,michal madesin and more.
I:9509;1539;Soon you'll find out and over all it was by far one of the my most favorite films.
I:9509;1540;Its a gangster movie so what can you say huh!It will forever be tarantinos best film than pulp fiction.
I:9509;1541;it shows in this movie that who can you trust and who you cant.
I:9509;1542;I recommend it to alldeleted scences and ectget it.you wont be dissapointed.
I:9509;1543;"I think that this is a great movie and any one who is a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" knows that ""Reservior Dogs"" is the precursor to that movie."
I:9509;1544;I think that this is probably my favorite movie that he's made, even though I think it's one of his first.
I:9509;1545;But on a second level, it is also about honor among thieves which does exist here.
I:9509;1546;On a third level, it's a story about simple friendships and trust.
I:9509;1547;this is an amazing film filled with powerful performances, especially from Harvey Keitel and Steve Buschemi.
I:9509;1548;All the performances for that matter are great.
I:9509;1549;Q. t. has given us an unusual, and unusually humorous, look into the world of men who happen to be criminals, and into the world of criminals who happen to be friends.
I:9509;1550;This movie is really good lots great actors and lots shooting action.
I:9509;1551;The bad guys are once again totally hip .
I:9509;1552;All of the actors do a great job and the storyline is great
I:9509;1553;I liked this movie .
I:9509;1554;The impression I got was that the scenes were so real , The actors gave the appearence of actual experience .
I:9509;1555;I loved the ending when it appeared that good prevailed over the bad
I:9509;1556;making, but it all pays off in this 1992 classic, starring an all.
I:9509;1557;star cast (Keitel, Roth, Penn), and having a plot so simple its brilliant.
I:9509;1558;coded nicknames (Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange)for each of them, blocking even their idenities to each other.
I:9509;1559;packed with tons of rememberable moments, smartly crafted by the great Quentin Tarantino.
I:9509;1560;This is why I give it 5 stars.
I:9509;1561;lasting impact in the human psyche deserves a place at the top.
I:9509;1562;With his knack for picking unique yet logical situations and exploding them onto the screen, he deftly takes us through the events that occur immediately after a failed heist.
I:9509;1563;Both elements are crafted with equal fervor in this film as in all of his others.
I:9509;1564;kilter plot coupled with masterful (and unique) execution.
I:9509;1565;The locations are few, and the fact that all of the really important events occur on one set gives the movie a very 'tiny' feel.
I:9509;1566;roving as Kill Bill , but it has its own charm nonetheless.
I:9509;1567;memorable moments include Michael Madsen dancing enthusiastically as he brutalizes a young cop, Tarantino himself analyzing Madonna's music, and the stunning Hamlet.
I:9509;1568;esque conclusion which leaves you with a decidedly bent mind.
I:9509;1569;despite its smaller scale, this is still a fine Tarantino picture and well worth the price.
I:9509;1570;a feature called the 'Pulp factoids viewer' is included which made me rediscover the movie, a lot of information on the movie appears on screen while you watch it, the Tarantino references to Scagnetti, the snake charmer (Bill from 'Kill Bill') as well as fun and technical facts were fun to read while watching the films.
I:9509;1571;Great cast and I really like the music choices in this film
I:9509;1572;It is a good movie and easy to follow the story line.
I:9509;1573;It is a joy to watch and it keeps you interested.
I:9509;1574;Quentin Tarantino has done an amazing job at taking a very low budget, and using a unique method of story telling and raw dialogue to turn it around.
I:9509;1575;He was also lucky to get a great cast much like Pulp Fiction did.
I:9509;1576;This film creates a new genre, because his un.
I:9509;1577;chronological and very raw vision will be and is being copied all over the world.
I:9509;1578;Some great performances are had too, for example Michael Madsen.
I:9509;1579;"I love this movie
I:9509;1580;The acting and filming are great and so is the soundtrack.
I:9509;1581;ray one on a great deal for $7.8.
I:9509;1582;Video and audio are solid for the price.
I:9509;1583;Film is great and features a great cast.
I:9509;1584;If you can get it for the right price, you owe it to yourself to give this film a shot.
I:9509;1585;It tells a good story of a ban heist gone bad.
I:9509;1586;It also shows, how the main characters got involved with the heist.
I:9509;1587;well if you love movies with suspence in it, or a good mystery trying to be solved then this is the movie you should look at.
I:9509;1588;It was Tarantino's first release and I wondered how he was able to get this great group of actors together.
I:9509;1589;If you like Tarantino's other films, this one will make you see where it all started.
I:9509;1590;The guy knows how to get good performances out of his actors.
I:9509;1591;This is a must see film it has all everything that makes for methe best film I have ever seen.
I:9509;1592;Although it is viloent it does notdeserve all the mad press that it got when it came out.
I:9509;1593;The acting in this film is outstanding with a list of stars that just add to the films greatness.
I:9509;1594;The directing is also fantastic giving the film a sense realism not food in many films.
I:9509;1595;How can one go wrong with a quentin tarantino film this one is no exception the acting is great, the story is awesome and the characters are pretty funny.
I:9509;1596;hero of this movie is the ruthless Mr. Blonde, perfectly portrayed by Michael Madsen (recently seen as Budd in Kill Bill).
I:9509;1597;Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is also a huge presence in this flick .
I:9509;1598;it's not Pulp Fiction and it's not Kill Bill, but it's definitely worth the watch.
I:9509;1599;it makes all the difference.
I:9509;1600;I totally love this flick.
I:9509;1601;I'm no Tarantinite, but I do respect his original and, I must say, ballsy work.
I:9509;1602;An outstanding cast including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi (whose Mr. Pink is, in my opinion, the standout of this film), an interesting and creatively done storyline and lots of gratuitous violence and language, Reservoir Dogs is certainly worth the great praise given by critics and fans alike.
I:9509;1603;But if you can take it, watch it!
I:9509;1604;this is what brilliance looks like.
I:9509;1605;This is a really, really good movie, one of my favorites.
I:9509;1606;The entire cast is a who's who among great actors.
I:9509;1607;I'd encourage all true movie fans to see this must.
I:9509;1608;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:9509;1609;I'm not a huge Tarantino fan, but this one is pretty good.
I:9509;1610;The extras are pretty much the same as the ones on the 10th, although the 10th has a little more.
I:9509;1611;if you enjoy action thrillers then this will be a treat.
I:9509;1612;The now legendary scene of the dogs walking down the street while that music plays is a movie landmark.
I:9509;1613;steve Buscemi proves he can be serious and still be funny.
I:9509;1614;It is a film you have to see to believe.
I:9509;1615;While opinions seem to vary widely on this movie (and the entire QT catalog for that matter), Reservoir Dogs is certainly a movie that comes up when you start talking about films that changed the rules and challenged the audience.
I:9509;1616;"style"" storytelling to it at all."
I:9509;1617;but it is still an essential film for those who consider themselves film junkies.
I:9509;1618;very dissapointed with this product.
I:9509;1619;Was sealed and in perfect condition.
I:9509;1620;Finally got Tarantino's first movie ive been a fan of his work since Pulp fiction but could never find this excellent movie, thanks
I:9509;1621;It's an excellent piece of artwork with the right quantity of additional material in a beautiful metal cast case that's looks like the gas can of madman Mr. Blonde
I:9509;1622;I luckily saw this when it first came out in the theatre and I like the others felt we witnessed something very daring and YES original.
I:9509;1623;Its not necessarily the overt language or the violence but a real palpable feeling that these characters are capable of doing anything at any moment.
I:9509;1624;This film was a true watershed along with other great smaller films that came out at that time.
I:9509;1625;Its a film made by a director who was hungry to put his ideas on film.
I:9509;1626;In 1993, I still remember the night my buddy showed up at the barracks with a VHS tape in his hand, and a sly grin on his face.
I:9509;1627;Ya gotta see this movie.
I:9509;1628;i watched Tarantinos little masterpiece twice that night, stopping it the second time as we went along in order to rewind and watch great (now classic) moments again and agin.
I:9509;1629;"from the absolutley brilliant opening scene at the diner, ""Let me tell you what 'Like a Virgins about'."
I:9509;1630;First off, Reservoir Dogs is a wonderful movie.
I:9509;1631;It's funny, smart and entertaining.
I:9509;1632;The dialogue is superb, as is Quentin Tarantino's other masterpiece Pulp Fiction, but the characters in Reservoir Dogs are just great.
I:9509;1633;Even though they're criminals, you can relate to many of their dilemmas and motives during the course of the movie.
I:9509;1634;The acting is also top.
I:9509;1635;The advertisements boast a booklet with many memorable quotes and photos .
I:9509;1636;The extras are good, but not really great.
I:9509;1637;"Reservoir Dogs has a lot of flashes of what's to come from Q. t. And for that reason alone, ""Dogs"" is worth a watch."
I:9509;1638;Probably what best illustrates this is the extended conversation between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) in the beginning of the film, regarding who set them up.
I:9509;1639;rate cast, and it pays off.
I:9509;1640;Lawrence Tierney, as the tough mastermind, is wonderful.
I:9509;1641;(I love how Q. t. brings back actors from the past.)
I:9509;1642;He may of stole the film.
I:9509;1643;"Another winner, is Steve Buscemi's argument with Joe (Tierney) over his designation as ""Mr. Pink."""
I:9509;1644;Very funny, in an Elmore Leonard sort of way.
I:9509;1645;You sense this director is a cut above most others.
I:9509;1646;I'll give the director this much: few films have ever gotten me thinking so much about why I dislike them.
I:9509;1647;"There's a lot to dislike about ""Reservoir Dogs""."
I:9509;1648;The film's violence is legendary, as is its potty.
I:9509;1649;The stage is set in the diner scene, as the cast takes turns mouthing cleverly.
I:9509;1650;Although the psychological element of fear is much stronger than anything you actually see in this film, there are a couple of gory scenes that will scar your memory forever once you see them.
I:9509;1651;tim Roth's performance is definitely the most piercing.
I:9509;1652;A song I once really liked still gives me the willies each time I hear it.
I:9509;1653;I don't care how many times you watch this movie, you see something new every time.
I:9509;1654;It's a great movie and made a great gift to a great friend.
I:9509;1655;I enjoy all of Quentin's movies, if nothing else they are very entertaining
I:9509;1656;This movie stands the test of time, and laughs in its face!
I:9509;1657;One of my favorite films of all time.
I:9509;1658;"a great movie,full of action,cool characters,an intresting story,some humorous dialouge and a killer soundtrack.You can tell this film was shot on a pretty small budget,but thats one of the things that makes ""Reservoir Dogs"" so great."
I:9509;1659;if you haven't seen this movie before,then I highly recommend that you do.
I:9509;1660;Reservoir Dogs is, in many respects, a precursor to the bigger and more sophisticated Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1661;However it's more basic, gritty style still highlights Quentin Tarrantino's directoral masterpieces.
I:9509;1662;All of the actors are among my old favorites.
I:9509;1663;Although the show is gruesome to some extent, I believe it portrays a lifestyle in a timeframe that is very realistic, and the actors performed it like they were living it.
I:9509;1664;"Somehow, in his first film, Tarantino arrives as the complete filmmaker
I:9509;1665;the film opens with a wonderful scene in a coffee bar, where the gang are meeting.
I:9509;1666;This is a classic Tarantino moment.
I:9509;1667;Essentially nothing happens except for an argument about a tip, but thats the whole point, its very real, and it is marvellously well written.
I:9509;1668;after the Coffee bar scene the opening credits role and Tarantinos trademark use of music hits you.
I:9509;1669;Its that sort of thing, and somehow Tarantino makes it work.
I:9509;1670;worth mentioning that the late Chris Penn appears in the film as 'Nice Guy Eddie', and there is one scene where he is in a car on a mobile phone.
I:9509;1671;but remember this was filmed 16 years so the mobile phone is the size of a brick!This is a great film.
I:9509;1672;This is a great movie and one of the highlights in my collection (and I have quite an extensive collection).
I:9509;1673;Mr. Quentin Tarantino can write dialogue so well.
I:9509;1674;Tarantino makes the audience feel as if the words that are coming from the screen would actually be something a person in that situation would say in real life.
I:9509;1675;Also, I believe Tarantino made an excellent choice in not choosing superstar actors who charge big bucks and the who demand a Star sticker on their door.
I:9509;1676;By the way, many credit Harvey Keitel for the excellent acting in the movie, but actually, I believe that Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi were absolutely awesome.
I:9509;1677;They are truly great actors.
I:9509;1678;Quentin Tarantino makes his motion picture debut a memorable one.
I:9509;1679;Tarantino is clearly a fan of the movies.
I:9509;1680;The acting is top notch.
I:9509;1681;Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are all outstanding in their roles.
I:9509;1682;Some movies you watch for entertainment, some for social commentary, to make you laugh or cry, to FEEL something.
I:9509;1683;There is NO social redeeming value to it and I join others who say: What was the point?
I:9509;1684;The casting, I must admit, is outstanding, (sans Tarantino who is a freak), Keitel is awesome, as he always is.
I:9509;1685;Many who see Resevoir Dogs think QT is a genius because the plot seems so 'original.
I:9509;1686;dogs is the first film by Tarantino that paved the way for his second and most successful film to date, the revolutionary Oscar winning Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1687;the movie features extraordinary performances by the entire cast, especially Madsen in his most sadistic role to date as the crazy Mr. Blonde (the torture scene where Blonde cuts off the cop's ear and pours gasoline all over him has become one of the most memorable scenes in motion picture history).
I:9509;1688;But what makes Dogs, and all other Tarantino films, an exciting film is the realistic and funny dialogue.
I:9509;1689;funny at times,But it is a dark,brutal film aboutbrutal dark people.
I:9509;1690;but all of the charactors are cool in theslick criminal kind of way.
I:9509;1691;It firmly established him as a director while still early in his career and he has made many great movies since.
I:9509;1692;the transfer of the video is very clean with strong colors despite a muting of the entire color grading throughout the film.
I:9509;1693;Contrast is excellent and details, even some of the very small ones, are clearly defined.
I:9509;1694;The audio soundtrack is beautifully spread across the front sound stage and the stereo separation of the typical Tarantino soundtrack is simply great, however, there really is no use of the rear sound stage for anything other than some light ambient echo which is barely discernible.
I:9509;1695;Also a Criminal Minds type profiling of the members of the gang that I found psychologically interesting.
I:9509;1696;I discovered this feature after I had finished watching the film.
I:9509;1697;Easily among the top ten most overrated films I've ever seen.
I:9509;1698;formed, and complete film I think it could have been.
I:9509;1699;it's easy to see why Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's first film because it has hints of what makes later films so great.
I:9509;1700;This movie has great acting, great dialogue, great performances and alot of twists and turns that will make your head spin.
I:9509;1701;Color is much improved, and blacks are darker.
I:9509;1702;great movie to watch once and awhile, enjoyed seeing it again and still like the twists in the story line.
I:9509;1703;Casting of the movie was great.
I:9509;1704;Tarantino is a genius and his method of stories within the story and his character development is unmatched by anyone in the land of neurotic, self absorbed, superficial Hollyweird.
I:9509;1705;Director Quentin Tarantino is one of the most passionate filmmakers I have ever seen.
I:9509;1706;length feature and it contains most of the elements we have come to expect.
I:9509;1707;That doesn't stop it from being a superb film, but it's interesting to see how he perfected his craft in later efforts.
I:9509;1708;if you have ever seen a Tarantino film, you'll know that his dialogue is distinctive.
I:9509;1709;It's clever, funny and logical, and it says a lot about the character.
I:9509;1710;this approach is present in all of Tarantino's films and it's so refreshing.
I:9509;1711;Tarantino's characters become more real because they talk about anything that comes to mind.
I:9509;1712;Orange was shot in the belly after the robbery and White and Pink are discussing what to do.
I:9509;1713;tarantino loves to pause the story to explain the origin or background of his characters, and he uses that technique in Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;1714;my favorite characters are Mr. White and Mr. Pink.
I:9509;1715;His final actions fit his character perfectly.
I:9509;1716;Keitel's character is the most complex.
I:9509;1717;Although he's a criminal, he has his own sense of honor.
I:9509;1718;His choices are somewhat brave under the circumstances.
I:9509;1719;Like Hitchcock, Tarantino allows us to imagine the events rather than see them.
I:9509;1720;You have to realize that Tarantino's films are dark comedies and that humor is present in almost every conversation or situation.
I:9509;1721;It's intelligent humor, but it's there.
I:9509;1722;As a result, I'm able to watch the violent scenes knowing that they are tongue.
I:9509;1723;reservoir Dogs is a fascinating and original look at events after a robbery.
I:9509;1724;I highly recommend Tarantino's unique style.
I:9509;1725;It's like watching a football game .
I:9509;1726;To protect things, nobody uses their real names.
I:9509;1727;"I don't usually like graphically violent movie, but I thought the infamous ""ear"" scene was very well done."
I:9509;1728;Tarantino told you up front exactly what happened, then he worked backwards to show what led up to it, then it concluded with the famous Mexican Standoff at the end.
I:9509;1729;"The sharp dialogue was also very creative, making this one of those ""quotable"" movies that are so much fun to watch, over and over again."
I:9509;1730;This collector pack is a MUST HAVE for the Quentin Tarantino fan!
I:9509;1731;"You get a great collector package and 6 shot glasses that have each of the main characters
I:9509;1732;One fatalistic line spoken by the Police take.
I:9509;1733;the story line is very good, the dialog excellent, but if you haven't got a strong .
I:9509;1734;"Everybody but ""Mr. Pink"" is satisfied with their color."
I:9509;1735;my rating is refection of my enjoyment level these movies all have great story line great actors and the right amount of depth and action to keep me interested all the way through.
I:9509;1736;It gets better each time.
I:9509;1737;Very graphic and bloody, but edge.
I:9509;1738;One of the best movies of all time.
I:9509;1739;Tarantino is one of the best directors.
I:9509;1740;I highly recommend this movie.
I:9509;1741;This is Tarantino at his best.
I:9509;1742;A strong dialogue driven character piece that involves amazing actors in outlandish situations.
I:9509;1743;The dialogue is crisp, the direction astounds and the story involving.
I:9509;1744;There are scenes that make you squirm and there are scenes that make you laugh.
I:9509;1745;"the opening shot alone with the ""dogs"" around the table discussing tips and Madonna sets the tone for an amazing movie to come."
I:9509;1746;"The disection of the crime and the organization that goes through it as well as many of the surprise twists keep you on your feet till the very last ""shot""."
I:9509;1747;a great debut for a great career.
I:9509;1748;Reservoir DogsA storyline that is so simple that when I tell it to you, you will be sure that you have heard it before.
I:9509;1749;Joe brings these criminals together to carry out a heist.
I:9509;1750;But we, the viewers, discover this well within the first ten minutes of the film.
I:9509;1751;This technique was groundbreaking in that it added an immense sense of realism for the viewer (you feel like you are right there!)
I:9509;1752;"For instance, the conversation pieces that take place in the cafe at the beginning of RD are hysterical
I:9509;1753;Indeed, these have become classics of cinema dialogue in their own right.
I:9509;1754;Difference 3: The SoundtrackEveryone loves to rave on and on about the Pulp Fiction soundtrack.
I:9509;1755;But, the RD soundtrack is equally superb.
I:9509;1756;"QT's films and his choice of music complement one another perfectly
I:9509;1757;A perfect example is the playing of 'Little Green Bag' to the criminals' Rat.
I:9509;1758;Mr Tarantino definitely knows how to get the best performances out of his actors (think John Travolta in Pulp Fiction).
I:9509;1759;"Indeed, you are unlikely to come across a better performance by Michael Madsen in a long long time
I:9509;1760;difference 5: Reservoir Dogs is MemorableThe film has moments that will stick in your memory well after you have seen the film.
I:9509;1761;famous Ear scene' in the middle to the sounds of 'Stuck In The Middle With You''The Four.
I:9509;1762;i recommend that you leave this one.
I:9509;1763;Despite starring some of Hollywood's heavyweights, it is a true let.
I:9509;1764;"If you are looking for action, appropriate violence and a REAl plot, investigate Tarantino's masterful ""True Romance."""
I:9509;1765;Reservoir Dogs is one of QT's first films before his success with the Academy Award winner Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1766;He uses classic out of sequence story.
I:9509;1767;Reservoir Dogs is a must see for all QT fans and action enthusiasts.
I:9509;1768;This movie is a family favourite!
I:9509;1769;They finally got the black levels right with this one.
I:9509;1770;The picture is really nice all around and with the option to listen to the movie in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS.
I:9509;1771;That one focuses on the impact of independent cinema that year and all the directors that came out of that period.
I:9509;1772;The fact that he compares himself and his colleagues as the closest thing to the French New Wave of cinema from the 60's is enough to make one roll their eyes (almost, anyway).
I:9509;1773;dip but it's worth it.
I:9509;1774;i would recommend this movie to anyone who is yearning for something a little more than the normal hollywood action movie.
I:9509;1775;Ok, high caliber cast, lots of smart dialogue .
I:9509;1776;get my point?I will say though, i so appreciate the song Stuck in the Middle with you a whoooole lot more now.
I:9509;1777;If you've never seen this film but find yourself uttering the phrase Oh Tarantino's great, I loved Kill Bill!
I:9509;1778;"I'm not going to do a synopsis or anything since plenty of others have done it and Amazon does it as well, suffice to say that it's a well done movie
I:9509;1779;The way the story is told is cool too, since you never actually see the failed heist.
I:9509;1780;This movie is great, and you don't see the ear being cut off contrary to popular belief.
I:9509;1781;I say that because it's so well written, and the dialogue, in particular, is so good, that I found this movie got better the more times I watched it.
I:9509;1782;If you can stomach extreme violence, definitely see this film.
I:9509;1783;There is some great filmmaking here, though depending on your tastes, you might not see it at first.
I:9509;1784;From that point of view, this is a must see, just so one can appreciate other modern films.
I:9509;1785;This helps explain their relationship.
I:9509;1786;the film made great use of 70's music, my favorite part of the film.
I:9509;1787;He makes good movies and is developing his style.
I:9509;1788;Reservoir Dogs stand as possibly his best movie.
I:9509;1789;And those are the two things that make the movie great.
I:9509;1790;The performances are very good, especially Harvey Keitel as the doomed Mr. White, Michael Madsen as the pscyopathic Mr. Blonde, and Steve Buscemi as the nervous Mr. Pink.
I:9509;1791;as I said above, the dialogue is great.
I:9509;1792;The way the criminals talk is exactly how you'd expect them to, and they play off each other very well.
I:9509;1793;reservoir Dogs is a classic crime movie, and quite essential.
I:9509;1794;It's gritty action packed and plenty unexpected plot twists.
I:9509;1795;This is another great masterpiece from the great director Quentin Tarantino , great story , great acting , not as good as Pulp Fiction in my opinion but still a great movie and highly recommended.
I:9509;1796;"That is especially true if it's an action flick, but ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the exception proving that rule."
I:9509;1797;This violently taut film grabs you in the first instant and throws you rudely right into the middle of a story filled with suspense, wonderful acting, and superb dialogue.
I:9509;1798;This is one of the best movies of all time!
I:9509;1799;Happy to have it on Blu Ray.
I:9509;1800;I have always liked the movie and it looks great on blu ray.
I:9509;1801;The movie's storyline is good, the dialogue is drawn.
I:9509;1802;But for a small low budget movie, the special effects are good, acting is good, and the ending was pretty awesome.
I:9509;1803;The movie has a few memorable quotes and great plot, but's its distorted by those factors.
I:9509;1804;It's hard to appreciate the few funny moments and dramatic moments.
I:9509;1805;This film got Tarantino noticed, one of the greatest movie makers of our time.
I:9509;1806;Noticed for the plot, few humor scenes, and few memorable scenes.
I:9509;1807;Bottom Line: Was this movie important?
I:9509;1808;If you like Tarantino films and this is first movie that jumpstarted his movie career, yes it's important to your collection.
I:9509;1809;line, with a few funny and memorable moments, and extended, vacuous, unneeded dialogue, and some low budget actors you'll never see again, then you should like it.
I:9509;1810;Reservoir Dogs started a new trend in Hollywood with the unorthodox storytelling and rich dialogue.
I:9509;1811;The movie is a classic and is original.
I:9509;1812;the actors are all superb and the condensed time frame gives the film undeniable suspense,but beyond what is patently obvious there is nothing else to the film.
I:9509;1813;After I watched this I see just how great of a story teller Quetin really is.
I:9509;1814;He doesn't just tell you a story he pulls you in by showing the results then slowly answering the questions the initial scenes create The cinematography isn't as good as later pictures, but the story is definitely complex and interesting.
I:9509;1815;I'll keep you for only a minute.
I:9509;1816;For a discussion of this film's virtues/demerits, read other comments.
I:9509;1817;it's also one of the most riveting movies ever.
I:9509;1818;jawed after the opening scene, and stayed that way.
I:9509;1819;Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino, and I think this movie is great.
I:9509;1820;The second disc is just full of so much CRAP!
I:9509;1821;Quentin Tarantino's classic RESEVOIR DOGS is one of my favorite films .
I:9509;1822;worthy, entertaining, and dark, it is a flawless masterpiece.
I:9509;1823;see film, and must be seen to be believed.
I:9509;1824;You have to take this film as a black comedy, with style.
I:9509;1825;The plot is weak, just another robbery gettaway kind of thing, but the script is superb.
I:9509;1826;Each character is so perfect and compliments the others.
I:9509;1827;the film contains some of the most memorable moments in cinema history.
I:9509;1828;reservoir Dogs is certainly not for the faint hearted, it's brutal, visceral and best of all.
I:9509;1829;Resevoir Dogs, in my opinion, is one of Tarantino's best films, if not his best.
I:9509;1830;And if anything, what makes Quentin Tarantino's movies so unique is the way at the end he always gives you something that you never expected on seeing.
I:9509;1831;Whatever color you like this movie has a character named after it.
I:9509;1832;You will be on the edge of your seat watching the twists and turns.
I:9509;1833;Everything was perfect, I loved how it was a mixture of comedy and action all at the same time.
I:9509;1834;I love the way Tarantino directs, Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie of all time, and Reservoir Dogs is not far behind.
I:9509;1835;The characters were so well developed, even though you hardly knew anything about them.
I:9509;1836;its so neat how you follow blonde out to his car, and come back to the music still.
I:9509;1837;I always loved this movie.
I:9509;1838;ray movie I have gotten.
I:9509;1839;I hafta say this is one of the better movies I've seen lately.
I:9509;1840;Its still a good movie though.
I:9509;1841;My favorite performances are by Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink Tim Roth as Mr. Orange.
I:9509;1842;Everyone else does great as well!
I:9509;1843;Michael Madsen gives a frightening pyschotic performance as Mr. Blonde.
I:9509;1844;I loved the way Quentin put everything together most of all how he made you think, which you had to do.
I:9509;1845;If you like Quentin Tarantino movies you will like this.
I:9509;1846;Strange but interesting and gripping, Some great actors here and well directed action scenes, Not for the fainthearted or squemish.
I:9509;1847;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:9509;1848;A great group of actors who play their parts to perfection and keep you interested the whole movie.
I:9509;1849;It's a must see for all movie lovers.
I:9509;1850;Let's start with the good things about this movie.
I:9509;1851;First, it's got a great cast: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Quentin Tarantino among others.
I:9509;1852;"Secondly, the unconventional structure of the film is brilliant, enhancing the intrigue and suspense of the ""who dunnit (ratted to the cops)""."
I:9509;1853;Finally, the movie has some great dialogue.
I:9509;1854;The entire debate on tipping between Mr. Pink (Buscemi) and Mr. White (Keitel) at the beginning of the picture is classic and illustrates how witty the wordplay can be.
I:9509;1855;This movie was awesome I give it two thumbs up.
I:9509;1856;The director acting skills and everything else about this movie was absoloutley amazing!
I:9509;1857;Great actors and it's a Tarantino !!
I:9509;1858;I knew what was going to happen in the end and throughout the whole movie, I just couldnt understand why people love this movie so much.
I:9509;1859;Reservoir Dogs is an incredible movie by director/writer/actor Quentin Tarantino, it tells the aftermath of a diamond robbery gone bad and the hunt for a possible undercover cop in a group of 6 professional thieves.
I:9509;1860;the actors in this movie are truly amazing I couldn't think of a better cast!
I:9509;1861;Amongst the men one of the most talented actors had to be Tim Roth who played the role of Mr. Orange.
I:9509;1862;Tim never ceases to shock me with his incredible acting abilities.
I:9509;1863;Reservoir Dogs gives its characters life, instead of just a couple of guys running around blabbering about what happened each person seems real, the way they interact seems so true you could almost feel like you are watching a real situation.
I:9509;1864;overall I would give Reservoir Dogs an 5 out of 5 rating and it is most defiantly a movie to see as soon as you can.
I:9509;1865;On the good side, the performance by Madsen as the sadistic Mr Blonde is really good.
I:9509;1866;The movie starts off great and conitues to be good until thbe end.
I:9509;1867;The Script is very impressive for Tarantino's first time out, and all the acters do great jobs, and I think because the acting in Reservoir Dogs was very well recived Tarantino decided that he was going to make more of his well.
I:9509;1868;another thing about Reservoir Dogs is its very compelling.
I:9509;1869;This movie is amazingly awesome.
I:9509;1870;I'm a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies.
I:9509;1871;But never got around to seeing this one until a friend recommended it to me.
I:9509;1872;Just saw it and it's an amazingly tightly scripted and well acted movie that flies by with excitement.
I:9509;1873;I would recommend this to Tarantino fans and action.
I:9509;1874;There are many reasons why this movie is excellent.
I:9509;1875;Tarantino makes great use of flash.
I:9509;1876;i was also caught by the surprise unmasking, which really made me enjoy the movie more.
I:9509;1877;From one of the best and most influential directors of the 90's comes this brilliant crime drama.
I:9509;1878;This has got to be up there as one of my top 15 movies, and probably one of my favorites from Tarantino.
I:9509;1879;This edition is NOT perfect.
I:9509;1880;The original laserdisc transfer looks better than this.
I:9509;1881;There's MORE picture information on the sides of the frame than the previous widescreen transfer, so that's a plus.
I:9509;1882;"It sounds like interviews from cast and crew edited together
I:9509;1883;The genesis of QT's introduction to Hollywood is now the stuff of legend, as the one.
I:9509;1884;Keitel occupies the essential role of having to develop a working relationship with the actors playing the three surviving criminals.
I:9509;1885;He must be father figure to the dying Orange, debate opponent to the philosophical Pink and Alpha.
I:9509;1886;the film's cleverest and most engaging scenes deal with the married.
I:9509;1887;ending debate of rational thought versus emotional thought, as the cool and professional Mr. Pink knows to examine all angles and aspects, not trusting anyone, while Mr. White has faith in his gut, believing more of what he wants to be true.
I:9509;1888;the White/Pink debates feature the fresh, pop.
I:9509;1889;Characters also discuss Pam Grier films, the true meaning of Madonna songs and their new favorite radio program, K. billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies (which provides great buffer music for the film's chapters).
I:9509;1890;guys, irresistible dialogue and a storyteller skilled in bringing his audience along with just enough information to keep them guessing, Reservoir Dogs deserves as much attention and admiration as Tarantino's more famous creation, Pulp Fiction.
I:9509;1891;And with an entire generation of filmmakers wanting to make the next Reservoir Dogs (the opening credit sequence that has been parodied in everything from Swingers to The Simpsons), its cult status will eventually grow into mainstream acclaim.
I:9509;1892;Reservoir Dogs is a good movie at best.
I:9509;1893;Critics make this movie out to be some kind of masterpiece of cinema.
I:9509;1894;It's good dialogue, but again, not the verbal and linguistic masterpiece that the critics make it out to be.
I:9509;1895;Overall, it's a good crime caper movie, that's good for about three to five viewings.
I:9509;1896;This movie is the best illustration of that.
I:9509;1897;Fans of Reservoir Dogs would also enjoy other films by Quentin Tarantino such as: Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, Pulp Fiction, and Django Unchained.
I:9509;1898;Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino on a budget of one million dollars, Reservoir Dogs is one of the smartest, most realistic crime yarns ever.
I:9509;1899;An excellent movie with tour de force perfomances from Harvey Kietel, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, Reservoir Dogs is frequently funny but also mean and gritty.
I:9509;1900;all that said I feel the acting was superb and all involved did a wonderful job, sans Tarantino as he really didn't do anything.
I:9509;1901;I actually liked the counterpoint of some of the characters and it really worked well.
I:9509;1902;It was nice to see Buscemi in a non comedic character role.
I:9509;1903;It does, however, stand as a great example of how hype can exceed ability especially in movies.
I:9509;1904;and that pretty much sums up this film.
I:9509;1905;Classic film full of surprises, action and twists.
I:9509;1906;Quentin Tarantino's first film and first look at his unusual style of presenting mayhem on a large scale.
I:9509;1907;It's taken five films to make Quentin Tarantino an official directing genius.
I:9509;1908;The best bet is to start where it all began, with Reservoir Dogs.
I:9509;1909;From the start, the film is in real.
I:9509;1910;Seemingly a simple plot, Reservoir Dogs is intelligent film making at its pure best.
I:9509;1911;reservoir Dogs is packed to bursting with a tense and intriguing storyline for its whole 90 minutes.
I:9509;1912;It is a film that is so accomplished that it is able to give the viewer an attachment to the characters in such a short space of time.
I:9509;1913;Amidst the sharp, dark and insanely witty dialogue, you get a three.
I:9509;1914;dimensional insight into these criminals through Tarantino's sheer genius in scene structure.
I:9509;1915;There are a host of scenes that are accomplished in just a few shots .
I:9509;1916;one camera angle often holds for several minutes, but yet, Tarantino still makes it feel all the more cinematic and theatrical, showing off the talents of actors such as Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi.
I:9509;1917;The background stories of the characters are fittingly summarised and neatly slotted into the flow of the film without disrupting it.
I:9509;1918;the acting on show here is superb, ranging from an empathetic Harvey Keitel, to a sharp, mocking Steve Buscemi, to a loyal loudmouth Chris Penn, to the silent Tim Roth, and to top it off, a collected, psychopathic Michael Madsen.
I:9509;1919;They intergrate into the scenes perfectly, which vary from light.
I:9509;1920;reservoir Dogs is an experience that is worth going through more than once.
I:9509;1921;The first time, as with most times, you'll watch it and be entertained by it, but give it a few viewings and you'll understand and be entertained by it, which is when the realisation of this magic in film will hit you.
I:9509;1922;hearted, Reservoir Dogs is a cult classic, riddled with violence, sharp dialogue, hugely clever sequences, and plenty of expletive .
I:9509;1923;Not too many pepole think Resevoir Dogs is funny.
I:9509;1924;Joe (the boss) found 5 criminals to rob a jewerly store and steal this diamond.
I:9509;1925;Mr. blond, Mr. pink, Mr. white, Mr. brown, and Mr. orange, because no one was supposed to know they're real names.
I:9509;1926;All the others got away.
I:9509;1927;Every one shows up at the ware house including Joe, Nice Guy Eddie (Joe's son) Mr. pink, and Mr. white.
I:9509;1928;my favorite charactes are Mr. blond and Mr. pink.
I:9509;1929;Mr. blond is really mellow and just chills, not getting [upset] about any thing.
I:9509;1930;He plays his role really good, so does Mr. blond.
I:9509;1931;r. Watch it when the kids are away at summer camp) but it serves a purpose .
I:9509;1932;it keeps you from guessing the the identity of the police informant.
I:9509;1933;film editing works deftly with the numbers game.
I:9509;1934;"great picture although I'm not sure why it's called ""Reservoir Dogs."""
I:9509;1935;"I watched the movie at a time when ""The Fantastic Four."
I:9509;1936;Watch Tarantino's picture and see if you can spot the linkage.
I:9509;1937;a film with a wonderful plot and some redeeming value.
I:9509;1938;As this is the movie that supposedly started off his successful career, I figured this was a great place to start.
I:9509;1939;Still a great movie and worth adding to your collection.
I:9509;1940;because I see picture insert it.
I:9509;1941;The result is that I am one part pleased with this film and one part disappointed.
I:9509;1942;reservoir Dogs is probably one of the most unique films in the fact that it is a heist film without the heist.
I:9509;1943;It adds a greater depth to the film.
I:9509;1944;to speak of technical issues, we'll start with director Tarantino.
I:9509;1945;He does well, to say the least.
I:9509;1946;In a film where the most abundant action takes place in the wide expanse of a nearly vacant warehouse, he always manages to inflect the scene with enough momentum to keep the audience's interest.
I:9509;1947;Shots rotate and move with a spirit that never culminates in the onscreen action, but in the onscreen characters as they pace amidst their own anxiety.
I:9509;1948;Everyone seems to know their character very well, and really in a film structured this way, that is the most important aspect.
I:9509;1949;and moreover, as directed by a filmmaker of Tarantino's sort.
I:9509;1950;Beyond all this however, beyond the perhaps too somber and too pessimistic portrayal of criminal life, is a thoroughly entertaining film that.
I:9509;1951;will nonetheless entertain you with a world so far gone from the norm.
I:9509;1952;"I believe this film to be excellent, and while it may seem like the plot is thin, it really isn't
I:9509;1953;I really enjoyed the fact that the actual theft isn't shown, viewers only get some of the snippets occuring beforehand and then the main storyline afterwards.
I:9509;1954;It's extremely powerful, and leaves the viewer contemplating the movie for hours after watching it.
I:9509;1955;All in all, it's the perfect balance of satisfaction and a craving for more.
I:9509;1956;reservoir Dogs looks great in blu.
