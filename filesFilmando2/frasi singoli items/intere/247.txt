I:334;1;This horror flick is so good, while Hostel is so dull and pointless.
I:334;2;This film is very underrated by moviegoers.
I:334;3;Surprisingly, many critics actually enjoyed this film along with big.
I:334;4;name Hollywood directors Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson (In fact, Jackson loved it so much he stopped filming one of the Lord of the Rings films for a week just so he could take the entire film crew to go see it).
I:334;5;And that water leads straight to the cabin.
I:334;6;mUSIC: This film has great, creepy music that sets the mood very well.
I:334;7;It also gets to you because you realize that all these situations could very well happen.
I:334;8;This film will leave you on the edge of your seat because even if you view it multiple times, it will still disturb and horrify you.
I:334;9;aCTING: For unknown actors, they were actually really good.
I:334;10;Whether they were terrified or telling dirty jokes, they all performed their roles very well.
I:334;11;tHE GOOD: Plenty of blood and gore, good music, fun sick humor, great acting, and a fun throwback to the old horror flicks.
I:334;12;Some loved it to death, while others completely loathed it.
I:334;13;Needless to say, however, my opinion of this movie is a good one.
I:334;14;In fact, I LOVED it.
I:334;15;'Cabin Fever' pays homage to the great horror flicks of the late 70's into the 80's.
I:334;16;This movie's main asset is the love story between Paul (Ryder Strong, who has the best XXX name, ever) and Karen (Jordan Ladd).
I:334;17;touch hillbillies (one of them only appears to be racist) are rather interesting and make the movie that much more disturbing (I especially loved that Dennis kid with the mullet).
I:334;18;The subtle references to other, older genre flicks was a nice touch for a fan such as myself (a revised version of a song that appeared in Wes Craven's debut, 'Last House On The Left' makes it's way here).
I:334;19;"Watching ""Cabin Fever"" reminded me of the fun one could have while making a horror film."
I:334;20;produced, under talented, and quintessentially making the same mold over and over merely for cinema dollars.
I:334;21;Fear was created within the unknown, or more importantly, from what we knew but our characters did not.
I:334;22;was one of those moments that proved Roth's loyalty to the trade.
I:334;23;"Instead, it felt more like a homage, a brief ""thank you"" to Roth's mentor."
I:334;24;"With that said, the second scene that speaks volumes of Roth's talent is something that he has carried with him throughout his ""Hostel"" years."
I:334;25;toting locals arrive to the cabin, two have guns while one merely carries a box.
I:334;26;but the effect and conversation that follows with your peers is sublime.
I:334;27;"again, ""Cabin Fever"" wasn't the bee's knees of horror films, but unlike Roth's future endeavors it demonstrated his ability to take a small idea and blossom it into true fear."
I:334;28;porn, this is a throwback to a stronger era of horror moviemaking.
I:334;29;"One part David Lynch, one part ""Wrong Turn"", and one part ""The Stand"" (that's a lot of parts) ."
I:334;30;Roth proves that he can handle a camera, a story, and a crew whilst scaring us, grossing us out, and creating a world within a world.
I:334;31;vIDEO: The film is loose, an amateur outing with quite a bit of ideas that seem under developed and over exposed, but I loved it.
I:334;32;It showed talent coupled with intrigue.
I:334;33;Cabin Fever ranks as more original and enjoyable.
I:334;34;There were some great scenes that were filmed with strong angles and a keen eye for storytelling, but nothing spectacular.
I:334;35;Decent transfer that could use a strong upgrade one day.
I:334;36;sOUND: One of the key elements to this film is the sound .
I:334;37;eXTRAS: This simple disc is packed with stuff.
I:334;38;"The ""Family Friendly"" version of the film is hysterical."
I:334;39;Roth hams it up for the camera, a la a Disney introduction.
I:334;40;"o. vision"" is a great inclusion."
I:334;41;"I thought he was a director to watch, and I still think he has quite a bit of potential, but to be remembered merely for ""Hostel"" just doesn't cut it."
I:334;42;Cabin Fever is a great entry into the world of horror, creating genuine scares and following a predesigned structure (not a bad thing for this film) .
I:334;43;Cabin Fever remains a strong entry into the world of horror.
I:334;44;If you are new to Roth, I say start here .
I:334;45;go back and see this again.
I:334;46;It is good after that, but it shouldn't take that long.
I:334;47;It's just a very solid horror movie.
I:334;48;The characters are very underrated as well.
I:334;49;Dennis, the blonde mulleted boy outside the convinience store is somewhat of a standout in the film.
I:334;50;His 'pancakes' scene is rib crackingly funny.
I:334;51;The dialogue is, for the most part, entertaining if not hysterical.
I:334;52;and Officer Winston may well be the best County Sherriff ever protrayed on film, Everything is ok ma'am, just go inside and have yourself a nice 40oz .
I:334;53;Eli Roth knows what he's doing and he is taking his time developing into one the best modern horror directors so he can endulge is fun movies like this.
I:334;54;Personally, I thought this movie was well scripted and very well made.
I:334;55;I also believe it has more originality than people are giving it credit for, especially in the midst of vampire mania.
I:334;56;This is one of the best films I saw within the past year in any genre.
I:334;57;It is also a more satisfying film than 28 Days Later , which I thought was a good movie but one that could have been better.
I:334;58;This film is an excellent experiment in how people react in a hopeless situation.
I:334;59;As the story continues the mood changes, and the effect begins to set in.
I:334;60;the characters are believable and deep enough to draw general care from the audience.
I:334;61;i reccomend this film to anyone who can watch it with an open mind, strong stomache, and who can ask themselves, What would I do?
I:334;62;This movie is the funniest, and most creativly gory movies, I've seen in a long, long, time!
I:334;63;It is the Best claymation I have ever seen, and it kicks South Park in the face!!!
I:334;64;the idea of the movie is good and it had potential, but I was shocked at how bad it was put together.
I:334;65;But it is decent as an ookie gorefest and alternative to a teen slasher movie.
I:334;66;The director is a fan and protege of Lynch, and it shows.
I:334;67;But when you watch it for the funny film that it really is then you can start to appreciate the movie.
I:334;68;The cast of characters, especially those the five friends encounter, are so clich d and stereotypical it's unbelievable, but that's all in good fun.
I:334;69;the acting is decent, but then again the film really doesn't call for the actors to act.
I:334;70;Joey Kern is decent for what is required of him, as is Jordan Ladd.
I:334;71;Cerina Vincent is just utterly gorgeous, enough said.
I:334;72;so in the end `Cabin Fever' is not a film to take seriously but is a film that, when taken for what it really is, is sure to entertain.
I:334;73;Angelo Badalamenti (twin peaks, blue velvet) who chreographed the music effects for the movie added a bit of eerie classic excitement to the film.
I:334;74;at some parts of the film you can really catch yourself with your mouth wide open in shock.
I:334;75;and appreciated the cinematography, occasionally on.
I:334;76;Through most of the film, I was having a pretty good time.
I:334;77;this film has some strengths, as I mentioned above, and I wouldn't be surprised if this director goes on to make some very good films working with superior scripts.
I:334;78;This movie was a lot of fun.
I:334;79;It could have been REALLY bad, but the director made some very good choices, such as, not creating a villian the audience could hate or even sympathize with, especially one with an attitude and one.
I:334;80;Yes, it goes off the deep end several times with plenty of stereotypes, and it's generous with the gore, but that's what makes this style of film fun.
I:334;81;The fact that it's not your standard slasher flick makes it interesting, and somewhat more intense.
I:334;82;It wasn't perfect, but it was fun to watch.
I:334;83;"Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 corpses"" provides one cogent example, and this film another."
I:334;84;star Eli Roth hits all the right notes, but it's strictly a karaoke performance.
I:334;85;Good luck, but you're welcome to try.
I:334;86;It is funny and scary at the same time.
I:334;87;Rider Strong is in it, and I have always enjoyed his acting since Boy Meets World.
I:334;88;Rider Strong does well acting in this horror movie.
I:334;89;This is a really good movie.
I:334;90;But if you do, and are willing to go into it expecting a lot, this movie is amazing.
I:334;91;It made me scared, and every time something was tense and frightening, something hilarious happened and made my crack up.
I:334;92;I watch this movie on a regular basis, I love it so much.
I:334;93;A lot of guys think it's a chick movie, but I know a few who really enjoyed it.
I:334;94;Defiantly give this movie a chance.
I:334;95;And watching the special features makes it all the better.
I:334;96;This is a GOOD movie!
I:334;97;Sure it has a great amount of gore in it, a bit of a graphic sex scene but it has a good story to it.
I:334;98;Plus it has VERY good humor.
I:334;99;the funniest part is at the very end.
I:334;100;I love Cabin Fever 1 and 2.
I:334;101;hounds will definitely be pleased.
I:334;102;the cast and crew are composed mainly of unknowns.
I:334;103;liners, f. words, and obligatory sexual innuendos are a staple of the genre, and are given in mass quantity here, making the movie unintentionally funny at times.
I:334;104;The special effects are the payoff, however, with skin bubbling and melting, blood spewing, and plenty of gruesome dismemberments.
I:334;105;inspired, and are very well done.
I:334;106;"I haven't touched them, but the ""Beneath The Skin"" documentary (30 minutes) is fun to watch, consisting of interviews with the main cast and crew, while splicing in behind the scenes shots, including many of the effects pieces."
I:334;107;What makes is fun is that nobody involved seems to take the movie too seriously, and obviously approached it as more of a fun project.
I:334;108;i bet it was more fun to make this movie than to watch it.
I:334;109;a student film with top techniques.
I:334;110;That's how I see it.
I:334;111;the featured short wax cartoon about the rotten fruits is pretty good.
I:334;112;Director Eli Roth has fashioned a decent little tale of hemorrhaging horror with his CABIN FEVER.
I:334;113;At first I was worried because the kids were so detestable (too mean, too stupid, downright sociopathic at times), but this ended up adding to the overall fun.
I:334;114;Just a good ol' romp through the forest!
I:334;115;I love Peter Jackson's work.
I:334;116;Like a lot of others have commented the characters in this movie are people you have great difficulty in liking.
I:334;117;The extra star I'm giving it is for the story concept.
I:334;118;Without question, Cabin Fever is the best modern horror flick of our time.
I:334;119;esque films, it delivers a lot more scares and surprises at every turn, and DOES NOT just rely on the blood and gore.
I:334;120;(though there is plenty to be found here) It also has enough suspense and thrills that will definately scare the hell out of you!
I:334;121;The issues that the film uses with human paranoia, murder, and death are good examples of how society is today.
I:334;122;They all fit the dark, nightmarish atmosphere quite well too, bringing us back to the good ol' homemade origins of what horror movies used to be considered in the 70s 80s.
I:334;123;Not only that, but it also mixes the best of the old with the best of the new with good acting, campy humor, metal music!
I:334;124;The story believe it or not, is actually based off an actual disease which is very rare to catch, but the results are truly horrifying!
I:334;125;Which was the funniest part in the movie.
I:334;126;If you enjoy watching kool.
I:334;127;Its really funny if I may say, I thought it was a pretty weird/good horror movie.
I:334;128;I was ridiculous but it is one you should see!
I:334;129;This is even better than Smiths usual two or three.
I:334;130;one thing we learn from the many commentary tracks is the depth to which the director and cinematographer played around with the photographic techniques, using options which I am not surprised to find in major Hollywood works such as `Network', but which seem to be a remarkable dedication to craft from this very independent crew.
I:334;131;there is a `making of' documentary, the most interesting item on which involved the casting of the dog.
I:334;132;If you like the movie already, get it anyway, since the extras are worth the price of admission.
I:334;133;definitely a film to watch for horror fans.
I:334;134;"While some may view Eli Roth's Cabin Fever as ""just another teen horror flick"", the film is actually quite refreshing."
I:334;135;Cabin Fever's plot succeeds, with the perfect combination of horror, gore, and outrageous humor.
I:334;136;"Perhaps my favorite character in the film is Burt, played by James DeBello, from ""Detroit Rock City""."
I:334;137;"DeBello brings the majority of the humor in ""Cabin Fever"" with his goofy antics and rediculous stories about masterbation."
I:334;138;"to sum it all up: an original story plot, well developed characters, humor in all the right places (while at times extremely bizarre
I:334;139;The main characters are viewed similarly to the way they viewed the infected man in the woods at the beginning of the film.
I:334;140;Cabin Fever is fun and entertaining, with all of the necessary components to create such a film.
I:334;141;I myself thought that the way it was akin to all those great 70s and 80s horror movies was terrific.
I:334;142;Evil Dead IS NOT scary, but it is immensely enjoyable and fun.
I:334;143;Just thinking about this movie is making me laugh.
I:334;144;There is some funny stuff within this movie.
I:334;145;But then as you think this movie is just full of laughs that's when the terror begins.
I:334;146;Well, **SPOILER** all in all he is the last one alive but is shot during his celebration of being the last one.
I:334;147;I enjoyed this movie even more after watching both the Director's Commentary and the interviews with Eli Roth (Director)and cast.
I:334;148;A mysterious skin disease begins infecting them and this movie shows what happens when fear sets in and one by one they all turn on each other in order to survive.
I:334;149;this movie mixes in humour and quirkiness to make this a fun horror film.
I:334;150;Rarely are horror movies scary or interesting in their own right.
I:334;151;cabin Fever is not particularly scary, but it is definitely interesting.
I:334;152;the acting is above par for a horror movie, particularly given that I've never seen these actors in anything else.
I:334;153;there is also some funny, funny stuff in this movie that is legitimately comedic.
I:334;154;if you don't like horror films, you may be pleasantly surprised by this one.
I:334;155;If you do like horror films, you will probably like this quite a lot.
I:334;156;"There really was nothing about ""Cabin Fever"" that I could easily recommend to anybody."
I:334;157;Best:1) If you like lots of blood in your horror movies, this ones delivers big time.
I:334;158;budget movies.3) All the girl stars in the movie have nude scenes.4) There are special features including 3 commentary tracks, a couple of behind.
I:334;159;A good splasher film is fine if there's a reason for it, say as in Hostel.
I:334;160;I know however that every movie has it's fans, and some of those Hostel fans may be inclined to check out what else the director has done.
I:334;161;So,if you're here because you enjoyed Hostel and want to check out the director's early works, here's my advice.
I:334;162;The story is actually genuine and the acting was good IMO.
I:334;163;I really liked this flick up until the last 20 minutes or so.
I:334;164;It had a good beginning and solid story throughout but what sticks in my mind the most is the ending, which blew*.
I:334;165;I'm shocked that this movie was bought and distributed.
I:334;166;If you compared it to the original Evil Dead which launched Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, you see real promise.
I:334;167;beat shopkeepers in town and their pancake.
I:334;168;loving son to the party.
I:334;169;Despite its flaws, CABIN FEVER strikes an even balance between the dark humor and horror, while also offering clean cinematography and a unique twist on classic genre conventions.
I:334;170;if you like campy horror films filled with profanity, nudity, college kids and blood and gore then this movie is for you!
I:334;171;5 college kids are out to take a break from the stress of finals and enjoy their summer at a cabin in the woods.
I:334;172;I actually ended up laughing through this movie.
I:334;173;Something to make fun of with the people you're watching it with.
I:334;174;It has absolutely none of the redeeming values mentioned above.
I:334;175;Give me and a few of my fellow Amazon reviewers here a camera crew and a two week lesson, and I guarantee we can make a better movie.
I:334;176;The bottom line, the only thing scary about Cabin Fever is the amount of positive reviews it has received here.
I:334;177;Scary Movie was a clever spoof.
I:334;178;Every once in a while one hears alot of positive feedback about a film and then one sees it.
I:334;179;First and foremost, this film's picture is gorgeous.
I:334;180;Every frame looks like a beautiful painting.
I:334;181;The music deserves special attention as well.
I:334;182;On his solo commentary track, Eli Roth makes fun of Film School Pretentiousness which exists.
I:334;183;This is the work of man who grew up watching the early 80's sex comedies and Fulci/Cronenberg films and decided to mix it up with Evil Dead and others and see where it took him.
I:334;184;Alot of this film is fun and beautiful and sick, but that is part of its charm.
I:334;185;It's also copied without the least bit of irony and in a film school sort of way, that's charming too.
I:334;186;Now, Eli Roth has proved he has talent to bring images and characters to the screen.
I:334;187;Now lets see what he does with a new story.
I:334;188;Had all the elementts of good horror, well executed, not THE best acting, but pretty good.
I:334;189;I bought it knowing it was B horror, and was pleasantly surprised.
I:334;190;Some friends of mine had me watch it and I LOVED IT so much that I went right out and bought it.
I:334;191;This is one of the most hilarious movies i've ever seen.
I:334;192;It's silly, campy, and basically a completely delightful romp.
I:334;193;I love scary movies and this one has its moments, but it really is just funny.
I:334;194;So many gems in this movie.
I:334;195;Watch it, you'll laugh, I promise.
I:334;196;It's gory sure, but it doesnt make it good.
I:334;197;I really loved this movie, it started out kind of slow making you think it was just another teen 'slasher' movie, But then it picks up and it is really what real people would do.
I:334;198;IT was just so realistic if you laughed at it you're an idiot.
I:334;199;This movie had gore sure, but it was all in the right place, and it was pretty freaky.
I:334;200;this would have got one star from me, but a few topless scenes from one of the actresses gets it an extra star.
I:334;201;I had mixed feelings about this movie, but I found that I had more positive feelings and felt it was an eerie, funny little film.
I:334;202;It displays a familiar little story about a group of friends who embark on a vacation to a cabin (sound familiar yet?)
I:334;203;But then, director Eli Roth who also writes, comes up with a freakishly original idea of making the teens not be killed by a masked monster or eaten by a family of cannibals.
I:334;204;It's a highly original plot with a sort.
I:334;205;of familiar setting, and it shows that Eli Roth has talent.
I:334;206;The music is absolutely scary, with some offbeat scoring that has great effect on the film.
I:334;207;The acting is fair, often sappy, but usually pretty good and Bert is one great character.
I:334;208;Some of the shots are truly unique and give a great atmosphere to the movie.
I:334;209;"Cabin Fever has a weirdly unique place in the recent horror movies in that it's not completely part of that ""torture porn"" crop of movies that focus mainly on disgusting audiences than outright terrifying them."
I:334;210;taking the familiar theme of a group of teenagers into the woods, you'd think some mask.
I:334;211;making kids ever and in the horror genre, that's seriously saying something.
I:334;212;One character, the sweet guy, decides to fondle the object of his desires since grade 8.
I:334;213;Nothing at all redeeming about this film.
I:334;214;At one point you can actually see an appliance flap as the actor breathes.
I:334;215;well, Mom always told me not to mock others so let's just leave it at that.
I:334;216;cabin Fever may have lacked in a number of areas (cohesive script, likable characters, an even, forward flow of the plot), but the effort was there, along with a whole lot of blood.
I:334;217;If you're looking for exceptional scripting, memorable performances (actually, Giuseppe Andrews as the cop who loved to party was pretty memorable), non.
I:334;218;Marcy knows some interesting bedroom techniques.6.
I:334;219;Joey Kern and Rider Strong should be extremely thankful for their roles in this film as both got to hang with a topless Power Ranger with an amazing rack.12.
I:334;220;spooning up with Karen, who was quite the tease by the way.
I:334;221;There's a healthy inclusion of extra features including five, count `em five full length commentary tracks, a featurette titled Beneath the Skin: The Making of Cabin Fever, a family version and a Chick.
I:334;222;vision of the film, three episodes from Roth's The Rotten Fruit animated show, a karate demonstration bit titled `Pancakes!'
I:334;223;"Eli Roth's ""CABIN FEVER"" is one of the best horror movies i've ever seen!"
I:334;224;Its also one of the most original takes on the backwoods horror genre.
I:334;225;I loved it and i also think that director Eli Roth is a breath of fresh air to the horror world!
I:334;226;They praised this movie and it came with above average reviews.
I:334;227;This movie contains great gore, comedy and actors.
I:334;228;There is a lot of blood in Cabin Fever, and that's normally a good thing, but once you've seen some walking rotten corpse projectile.
I:334;229;worthy for the most part.
I:334;230;There is one exception to this, though, and this is the closest thing this film has to a saving grace of any kind: the very last scene is absolutely hilarious .
I:334;231;There was a good plot line untill about the last 30 mins it started to get confusing!
I:334;232;The fifth day of thinking about this movie I realised it is a classic.
I:334;233;The thing is It is very very funny.
I:334;234;The Orville Redenbacher Natural popcorn was very good.
I:334;235;even so, in the last third, Roth finally lets rip, delivering a couple of choice moments destined to linger long in the memory of even the most jaded gore hound.
I:334;236;Female viewers take note .
I:334;237;His final moments in the film, in particular, I daresay, are Oscar.
I:334;238;worthy, if those prudes would give horror motion pictures a chance.
I:334;239;"the writing's also quite nice, with the scenes of horror not standing alone, as the writers skillfully throw in ""small."
I:334;240;y quirks, such as police officer Winston, who is obsessed with parties and one awesome campfire tale about a bowling.
I:334;241;it's hard to define why this film works so well, but it does.
I:334;242;Nice pacing, good direction, just enough quirks to make this film it's own thing.
I:334;243;The couple sitting just in front of me got up and exited the theatre.
I:334;244;They were blanketed with compliments and a nice sustained applause.
I:334;245;great new horror flicks dealing with infection, 28 Days Later being the greatest followed close by Eli Roth's Cabin fever.
I:334;246;great effects, music, acting, edge of your seat, and good laugh's at some points.
I:334;247;His disease is spread through the lake water and into the cabin's tap!
I:334;248;It had funny moments, and a few scary moments also.
I:334;249;, Pancakes [you'll see what it is!]
I:334;250;, Beneath the Skin: Making of Cabin Fever, a family.
I:334;251;and to see the two actors from a good film like detriot rock city, have hit rock bottom when they signed on for this movie.
I:334;252;although ginger snaps was pretty good.
I:334;253;It said it was going to be scarey but actually it was quite funny.
I:334;254;If you think this is a scarey movie your wrong it's a comedy.
I:334;255;one crazy summer (the comic relief, an 80's teen flick)Mix them all together.
I:334;256;At least Wrong Turn had a discernable story, with a direction for the characters to follow.
I:334;257;Watching this movie is a lot like listening to Anti.
I:334;258;All it makes me think is that the writers should have been a lot less lazy in writing this script, and come up with some real funny lines and characters rather than rendering every single one of the five.
I:334;259;And the ending, while somewhat of an amusing gag .
I:334;260;The Evil Dead was often funny while being horrific, and thanks to Bruce Campbell's great presence and Sam Raimi's sympathetic handling, you cared about the characters in that cabin.
I:334;261;Tons of interesting possibilites, there.
I:334;262;so: how do we keep those Stupid Teens at the camp, despite the fact that they're being ravaged by a disease?
I:334;263;All I can really say is.
I:334;264;I can see influences but it is nice to see a first time director develop his own style, give the man some credit.
I:334;265;it was also nice to see some new actors with talent (the deputy).
I:334;266;dont nit pick, watch it, laugh and throw up when your done.
I:334;267;if you understand what kind of movie this is then you'll appreciate it.
I:334;268;for the type of movie this is, it's brilliant.
I:334;269;I won't quote his review, but Wiki cites the key sentences, so I refer you to that.
I:334;270;Of course, it was a considerable financial success measured by box office take as compared to cost of production.
I:334;271;I refer you to any of the five star reviews to explain why.
I:334;272;Disease is usually good bait for film directors trying to stay original in the horror genre, and there are plenty of good examples of films which depict disease to good results.
I:334;273;I loved Roth's Hostel movies, but still hadn't seen this one, where he got his main recognition.
I:334;274;I thought it was a great horror movie, with plenty of blood and gore.
I:334;275;'Cabin Fever,' to me, was a really good film.
I:334;276;Low budget, but very effective.
I:334;277;classic (or will be) due to the simple plot, tons of gore and characters you can relate to.
I:334;278;There is something visceral, almost primal, about the fear of disease.
I:334;279;but the oddest thing about this movie is that everyone, including the dog, has anger issues.
I:334;280;i really wanted to love this movie.
I:334;281;One of the group had seen a trailer for Cabin Fever and thought it would be a good laugh.
I:334;282;I'll admit to laughing a couple of times during the movie.
I:334;283;That whole thing with the Hanson kid and his pancakes was hilarious.
I:334;284;There were two good points in the film .
I:334;285;cabin Fever is a film where one gets the distinct impression that the writer/director is truly an enthusiastic horror fan that wants to pay homage to as many genre classics as possible, while also carving this film its own niche as a scary, funny gorefest.
I:334;286;And certainly, director Eli Roth gets much of the film right and has a strong handle when it comes to pacing and dreadful anticipation.
I:334;287;roth also smartly develops the characters first, which has been a surprisingly growing trend recently (Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake also attempted to flesh out their characters first).
I:334;288;dimensional characterizations at work here, but the protagonists are generally likeable, particularly Rider Strong and Jordan Ladd.
I:334;289;up, that of the teens having to deal with the disease, is a great one.
I:334;290;but for all the mistakes the second half makes, I still had a pretty good time.
I:334;291;We see so many horror flicks about zombies and serial killers (and while they are great) that it's refreshing to experience a new kind of horror.
I:334;292;i thought it was well.
I:334;293;and the funny points in the film were a nice counterbalance to the carnage.
I:334;294;Also, the extras are great.
I:334;295;"Its got deranged hillbillies a la ""Deliverance "" and the added ingredient of a lethal virus just to make things a tad more interesting."
I:334;296;It was one of the funniest movies i had seen in a very long time.
I:334;297;And it was funny in the way of, where the hell did that come from?
I:334;298;jokes about the rednecks are pretty funny.
I:334;299;The finale is pretty dissapointing though.
I:334;300;off (except that Raimi had cool demons possess the characters and had an amazing visual flair even at the age of 19 when he made the original Evil Dead.)
I:334;301;the acting was good, and the special effects were equally as good.
I:334;302;*CABIN FEVER* I remember seeing the commercials and thinking, this is going to be a great scary movie and it's that reason alone that I think many hated this movie after seeing it.
I:334;303;It's funny and for all the right reasons and at all the right times.
I:334;304;Oh and it will make you laugh.
I:334;305;i must say, it's really a good horror.
I:334;306;spoof if you go into it thinking it's spoofy.
I:334;307;The acting is very good, the gore is there and it has some great funny moments.
I:334;308;is it a good movie?
I:334;309;Oh yeah, especially when watching it with a group of like.
I:334;310;That said, let's take a look at it on its own merits.
I:334;311;because that is one thing it really is.
I:334;312;if you are actually past your teen years you'll probably look away from the screen as I did.
I:334;313;The key to making a good horror film is to make the world of the film believable.
I:334;314;"The filmmaker creates a very ""real"" threat (a skin."
I:334;315;some people are touting this film are having an edge or style, even saying that the director is the new Peter Jackson.
I:334;316;Thing is, the old Peter Jackson is enough for all of us.
I:334;317;Lots of strong language, some nudity and lots of blood.
I:334;318;Usually I find it hard to respect movies that have these adult themes, but it all makes Cabin Fever the great movie that it is.
I:334;319;I can tell you that Im a fan of stuff like strangers with candy, kids in the hall and The new texas chainsaw massacre from 2003.
I:334;320;If you like all that stuff, then give this movie a look.
I:334;321;An entertaining and surprising effort, Cabin Fever is one of the most refreshing horror movies of the last years, adding some new blood to a somewhat tired genre.
I:334;322;Still, director Eli Roth presents an intriguing and scary enough flick, providing a couple of suspenseful moments with many darkly comic situations.
I:334;323;crafted and the overall mood and atmosphere are very convincing as well.
I:334;324;Cabin Fever isn`t as good as Danny Boyle`s 28 Days Later , still it offers a lot of good scenes with some memorable and sinister details.
I:334;325;nothing wrong with wearing ones' influences on their sleeve,but some originality would be nice.
I:334;326;I see that they actually made a follow.
I:334;327;While Hostel was fun, Cabin Fever is simply just an amazing horror film!
I:334;328;It offers humor, horror and a classic storyline.
I:334;329;the acting is decent and the story is fun, so in the end `Cabin Fever' is a somewhat campy, fun and entertaining horror movie that is the best thing Eli Roth has ever done in my opinion.
I:334;330;This is definitely worth a watch!
I:334;331;I'm a huge fan of the horror movies from the 1970's and 1980's.
I:334;332;it's hard to hit on any good points involved in this film.
I:334;333;As a matter of fact the best part of this movie (besides the ending credits, because at that point mercifully it's over) is cenetered around the shotgun in the country store in the early going and at the end of the movie.
I:334;334;1 1/2 stars at best
I:334;335;I did, and I'll be ordering it right after this review.
I:334;336;Is this an academy award winning movie?
I:334;337;nudity, and humor to top it off.
I:334;338;These are the characteristics and important qualities in making an 80's horror movie.
I:334;339;Of course not, and in fact most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies have Freedy saying some pretty funny dark comedy lines.
I:334;340;This movie is a fantastic work of art of tribute to famous 80's horror movies.
I:334;341;If you are a fan, you will see the tributes and remember them from your favorite movies.
I:334;342;oh yeah and if anyone can explain what the point of those black guys rapping is please tell me
I:334;343;The ending is bizarre and stupid and I laughed at it.
I:334;344;It takes a special person to really enjoy this movie.
I:334;345;A sick twisted person with a love of satirical wit and an appreciation for the type of effort put into making a film such as this.
I:334;346;number one, The movie is Supposed to be funny.
I:334;347;to dispicable, then you get to see them get whats coming to them, it's great!
I:334;348;i recommend this movie if you have a sick sense of humor, are a fan of all aspects of the horror genre, like a lot of gore, and are just looking to be entertained for a couple of hours.
I:334;349;in that case, it will terrify you.
I:334;350;this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat within the first 5 minutes.
I:334;351;This is one I'll watch over and over.
I:334;352;And the substance (the meat) of this film is precisely along the surrealistic lines of David Lynch's style of direction .
I:334;353;"The film is very well done, very well scored, very well choreographed and shot
I:334;354;downplayed and reflective of these types of characters, even though NOT ONE is likeable in the least way, and will be the dominant reason you'll wish to stop watching the film.
I:334;355;'Cabin Fever' is the best film of its kind: a reflective homage to a few inspirational and highly popular 70s/early 80s independent horror films.
I:334;356;It's nerds like you that drive people away from genre work in the first place.
I:334;357;What I loved most about this film is that it reminded me of those drive.
I:334;358;I loved how everything in the movie was pretty much left open.
I:334;359;OK, maybe thats stretching it a bit, but I still found many of the scenes fascinating to watch.
I:334;360;The way the rest of the group subsequently turn on their infected friend says a lot about human nature, especially when confronted with the unknown.
I:334;361;But in that also lies it charm.
I:334;362;Once you suspend your disbelief (or even your own criteria for that matter), and get swept up in the ride, the film becomes a lot of fun.
I:334;363;There's so many funny scenes that just come out of nowhere.
I:334;364;The characters are great too.
I:334;365;To top it off, the movie got a rave review from Peter 'Lord of the Rings' Jackson, who got his start making incredibly over.
I:334;366;to appreciate this new spin on an old theme.
I:334;367;Proof positive that, with imagination, the classic horror template still delivers, bigtime.
I:334;368;About halfway through it hit me that this was a clever little spoof (albiet a subtle one), on woodsy horror flicks.
I:334;369;Decently amusing B. movie entertainment.
I:334;370;I heard just about everything that happened in the moive and I thought that this movie would be AWSOME!
I:334;371;The acting and production values are decent and the plot was able to keep my interest.
I:334;372;when he asks for help the teenager gets scared and shoots at the hermit again wounding him.
I:334;373;we see a dog who has been spit down its stomach and we can see inside its bloody body and blood squirts on a mans face.
I:334;374;this scence is kind of disturbing,but also kind of funny,and also has a nice deal of blood in it.
I:334;375;a man is hit in the face with a canteen which causes blood to start spewing from his mouth and he is killed.
I:334;376;a man is shot in the side with blood splattering everywhere,and is then speared in the back while trying to craw away.
I:334;377;its very good and brings something new and cool to the horror gerne.
I:334;378;It even pokes fun of the usual grind of black man = first to die towards the end in a truly humurous way!
I:334;379;The writing and acting are above par for one of these movies and the director has done an excellent job in all aspects of this movie.
I:334;380;This time around, the assailant is in the form of a flesh.
I:334;381;ridden hermit, thanks to Bert mistaking the man.
I:334;382;and, as we all know, water is an essential requirement for human survival.
I:334;383;jab to the gut, then he or she can anticipate a rich helping of what.
I:334;384;Given, this film is a lousy excuse for streaming entertainment, but, if nothing else, it does keep your eyes glued to the screen.
I:334;385;If you're into horror/gore movies then you'll definitely get a kick out of this.
I:334;386;i happened to enjoy this movie.
I:334;387;this movie has just the right about of gore and funny one liners to make it worth watching at least once.
I:334;388;This has to be one of the best movies of 2003.
I:334;389;The way in which the friends treated each other once they became ill did give us a glimpse into the way human nature operates, and it shows our tendency to revert to fight.
I:334;390;That aside, this is just a fun, great movie!
I:334;391;a lot of swearing, but hey, they're young adults.
I:334;392;if you like pretty good special gore effects, this is okay.
I:334;393;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
I:334;394;With the top down and the music up, they drive to a remote cabin to enjoy their last days of decadence after college.
I:334;395;Karen's skin starts to bubble and burn as something grows inside her, tunneling beneath her flesh.
I:334;396;One by one they turn on each other and the rest of the town.
I:334;397;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
I:334;398;I would recommend this movie to other people.
I:334;399;"Inside is a note, ""Welcome to Bunyan Mountain Getaways""."
I:334;400;Bert shoots at what he thought was a squirrel, but it is a man.
I:334;401;He gets inside Jeff's automobile and spews blood everywhere.
I:334;402;"And Dune, and many Godzilla movies, and way more movies than I care to mention (even ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"")."
I:334;403;See above, this movie just plain sucked, I love b. movies and horror movies, I even liked Killer Tongue.
I:334;404;anyone know?the only good part of the movie was the end, it was funny.
I:334;405;I initially expressed some measure of excitement when I learned about Eli Roth's Cabin Fever.
I:334;406;A whole host of reasons contributed to my dismay.
I:334;407;What a wonderful way to spend a weekend!
I:334;408;After the picture reaches its mid.
I:334;409;I recommend Cabin Fever only to those hardcore horror fans that simply must see as many genre pictures as possible.
I:334;410;Another example of the previews making the movie look like a real winner.
I:334;411;i give this movie 3 stars, because I laughed so many times.
I:334;412;graphics: (Death and gore scenes) 10/10: A VERY well done movie when it comes to the graphical nature.
I:334;413;comedy: 10/10: Read the above scenes.
I:334;414;originality: 9/10: A seriously f'd up movie, very original.
I:334;415;hop hoedowns on the front porch, or what either of the last two points has to do with the protagonists' encounter with the virus.
I:334;416;"It is in this technique that Roth excels, both here and in ""Hostel,"" the instant classic anti."
I:334;417;Roth is both cannier and more bold in his follow.
I:334;418;But for a cool two hours, it's fun.
I:334;419;It's not scary, it is not a horror, it's simply discusting and wonderful.
I:334;420;The rest of the casting was good also, the two members from Detroit Rock City help the film out too.
I:334;421;Cabin Fever is a good movie, but I would say that it appeals to veiwers who like gore more than horror.
I:334;422;another great thing about this movie is its unpredictable yet surpringly fitting ending.
I:334;423;this movie is very good in its own way, not now and never will be a classic just a good decent horror movie with lots of blood and a pretty creepy story.
I:334;424;$10 it is way worth it and a nice little piece to have in a horror collection.
I:334;425;a good story,good creepy feeling,a good amount of blood, well a lot of blood, a movie that I feel is viewable plenty of times and not a waste of money.
I:334;426;I personally loved the corny ending, and for me it redeemed itself immensely.
I:334;427;Does it show signs of hilarious comedy?
I:334;428;Horror movies are one of my favorite genres and I love when comedy is mixed into the bag.
I:334;429;I, like others, am not a huge fan of explicit gore, but this movie uses it to its full potential.
I:334;430;His directing was fantastic and kept everything at a fast pace, but gave us time to learn about our characters and who they were and what they did.
I:334;431;Also, the idea of your friends turning on you is an intense thing.
I:334;432;Yet, overall the plot was very good.
I:334;433;Rider Strong did an okay job as Paul.
I:334;434;Joey Kern did a great job as the mean.
I:334;435;I thought Cerina Vincent showed her acting abilities to the best.
I:334;436;She actually cried at one point in the film.
I:334;437;Either way, it was good to see that.
I:334;438;He is by far, my favorite of all rising stars.
I:334;439;As the film progressed, I really came to care about his character and what happened to him.
I:334;440;The pacing in the movie was very good.
I:334;441;"It isn't exactly as fast paced as ""Wrong Turn"" (you can see that review also), but it still was good."
I:334;442;You actually care about the characters and what is happening to them.
I:334;443;It makes you more interesting in the story and when the good parts start coming, you're glued.
I:334;444;An enjoyable experience that was too good to be true.
I:334;445;It was fun, gory, hilarious, corny, and intriguing.
I:334;446;If they do make one, they better take a lot of time and effort into making it really great.
I:334;447;Plus I really liked winston the police officer.
I:334;448;Campy dialogue, unbelieveble situations and characters and the usual body count.
I:334;449;With a movie like this, that is a must.
I:334;450;some kids who just got out of college go up to a cabin to have some fun.
I:334;451;much like the Scream series and similar, this harmless film has its moments of humour and self effacing jabs at the genre.
I:334;452;Watch them stumble about and croak slowly while turning on each other in suspicious fashion.
I:334;453;Surprisingly, he alone experiences a small amount of growth.
I:334;454;If you're true and honest to your craft you grow as you practice it.
I:334;455;Perhaps future endeavors will be better.
I:334;456;It is a good movie but not much for rewatch value.
I:334;457;In it's attempt at humor it laughs at itself.
I:334;458;this movie's not even good enough to use as a book end.
I:334;459;I agreed to watch this film with a friend after he said it was a pretty good movie.
I:334;460;I enjoyed it, but I can understand how a lot of people think it sucked.
I:334;461;this is definetly a comedy.
I:334;462;i laughed allot and it was pretty funny.
I:334;463;This movie starts funny and aloof, then it starts down a surprising chain of events that only a true fan of the genre could diabolically invent.
I:334;464;The end of the movie had me laughing out loud and jumping out of my chair with excitement.
I:334;465;A great story with many twists and turns, a lot of gore, laughs, and most of all, a little nudity.
I:334;466;Add that to great extras and you have a must own.
I:334;467;I first saw this movie on t. v. and I loved it.
I:334;468;There are too many jokes and funny moments for it to be taken too seriously.
I:334;469;I suppose that's why I enjoyed it.
I:334;470;"It's worth it for many laughs and a few, ""eew"" moments."
I:334;471;I stumbled across this movie on television one year around Halloween time and I only really watched it because I really liked Rider King Strong.
I:334;472;I must say that now, every year, it is a family tradition between my mom, brother, and I to watch this movie at Halloween time.
I:334;473;We must make fun of it and laugh at how 'scary' (not at all) it is.
I:334;474;That alone sets it above most Hollywood (and independent) movies, which depend on familiarity for response.
I:334;475;In addition, filmmaker Eli Roth generates some screen heat from both his good.
I:334;476;hearty giggle and wobbly bike mannerisms, is a stunningly good looking guy and who should have been nominated for an Oscar here for best scene.
I:334;477;"This is an ""Original,"" inventive, and well done movie."
I:334;478;To each their own, I highly recommend it.
I:334;479;this movie was meant to be fun and it was meant to be gory and it succeeds on both counts.
I:334;480;Of course it is, that's what makes it fun!This movie is very entertaining if you watch it for what it is, and aren't expecting some deep, psychological thriller.
I:334;481;most horror fans should find Cabin Fever enjoyable.
I:334;482;So glad I found it:) great cast and story my whole family loves cabin fever.
I:334;483;I wanted to know the origins of the disease, and I definitely wanted to see better actors.
I:334;484;, etc.) I just had to see it, well, being a big fan of horror movies and everything.
I:334;485;if you want to see a 'classic.
I:334;486;First time director Eli Roth exhibits true technical competence, a clear sign that he was weaned on this genre, but he actually proves to be too good for his own good in this 2003 film.
I:334;487;There are so many moments in Cabin Fever that show an understanding of true horror and are going to stick with you, that makes it clear the kid has got potential in this genre.
I:334;488;"One of the primary reasons I saw ""Wrong Turn"" was because I was familiar with, and liked most of the actors (or actresses) in the movie, and that was a similar with this movie."
I:334;489;James DeBello (Detroit Rock City, 100 Girls) has been hilarious in every movie I've seen him in, and Ryder Strong was on Boy Meets World, so you gotta love him.
I:334;490;with a very likable and funny cast, and interesting (but totally unrealistic) storyline, and plenty of jokes and wild rednecks running around to entertain you, you should definitely check this movie out if you haven't seen it.
I:334;491;Especially if you liked other movies or shows the cast has been in, you'll like this one.
I:334;492;well, I did to be honest, but I'm still here to talk about it.
I:334;493;gO out and get this movie ASAP, and write a great review!
I:334;494;intelligent when the times to PANIC came.
I:334;495;I read that the movie was about supernatural happenings out in the woods and that sounded intriguing to me.
I:334;496;I also find it funny that Peter Jackson saw the movie.
I:334;497;"As a horror movie fanatic, I've seen a lot of horrible movies, but ""Cabin Fever"" is undoubtedly in the top three."
I:334;498;and you've got this movie.
I:334;499;This movie is funny and scary.
I:334;500;Great mix for a horror film.
I:334;501;Honestly, I thought it was one of the best horror movies I had seen in years, and I'm a horror junkie.
I:334;502;I laughed through it, as they go through the typical 'teenagers in the woods' horror film scenarios over and over again.
I:334;503;Save your money and watch a good thriller, like SEVEN!
I:334;504;Walmart has to price match and they did just that!
I:334;505;The movie itself is great.
I:334;506;I seem to be one of the few that loved this movie !
I:334;507;In fairness, the photography isn't bad and production design works.
I:334;508;I personally liked this movie, I love horror movies.
I:334;509;It is scary in its own way.
I:334;510;up was great and looked very much like what the real thing looks like.
I:334;511;This movie is a change from the basic Jason or Michael movies.
I:334;512;James DeBello also pulls off a great Bert.
I:334;513;he is a great actor and I love him!!!!
I:334;514;Cabin Fever is a great movie and I WOULD recommend it.
I:334;515;This is one of the best horror movies of 2003, the other is TCM!!!!
I:334;516;headed looking enough and the chicks in the film always seem to keep that makeup and clean hair look even after days of torment.
I:334;517;massive amounts are spewed and shot and poked out of the kids and the local rednecks and even some animals.
I:334;518;great gory fun and there is even a sympathetic killing with a shovel of a poor chick whose face has been eaten off.Yeeee.
I:334;519;But what I have to add Is that this movie has more twists and turns than most good thrillers.
I:334;520;This Is well directed and acted.
I:334;521;well, I finally decided to give a shot, and I have to say this is by far and away one of the best horror movies I have ever seen!
I:334;522;Everything about this film works.
I:334;523;the cinematography is extraordinary, the special effects are brilliantly gruesome, and the musical score creates a tension that is beyond anything I have ever experienced during a movie (if you watch it a second time pay careful attention to the music and you will understand why this movie causes so much tension).
I:334;524;The acting performances are above average for a horror film, and the dialogue is unforced and natural.
I:334;525;The characters in this film are believable, which is more than you can ask for in this genre.
I:334;526;When a movie can draw you in and make you experience what the characters are experiencing.
I:334;527;"happy Bert (James DeBello) is so aggravating, relief is felt when his life finally ends (where, ironically, the hunter looking to shoots ""gay (!)"
I:334;528;If only his presence is the only thing that makes the audience cringe, but alas, most of the production does as well.
I:334;529;cat film of all these classics.
I:334;530;His performance as the doomed hero is both sharp and fresh, and so worthy of better projects.
I:334;531;The rest of the cast (including the uncredited acting part of director Roth himself as the pot.
I:334;532;smoking freak) goes from decent (first girl.
I:334;533;"the second half of the film is where the ""fun"" really begins and it is also where the plot really thickens, as we are treated to a no holds barred action/horror flick with surprising twists and turns."
I:334;534;reaction shot of the hiding.
I:334;535;But despite its many flaws, the film stays with you.
I:334;536;I really liked this movie.
I:334;537;It had me laughing throughout the entire flick.
I:334;538;I love the scene when the deer gets hit by the car and then its hooves beat inside the truck and it honks the horn a few times.
I:334;539;This movie is fun to watch.
I:334;540;It has a good amount of grossness and suspense allways wondering who is next .
I:334;541;take a chance with this one.
I:334;542;It's definatly worth a view
I:334;543;Cabin Fever was more of a funny movie then a horror.
I:334;544;Though the characters in it did great jobs acting.
I:334;545;I am giving this movie two stars because I enjoyed it, to a certain degree.
I:334;546;Not one believable moment of people acting like real human beings.
I:334;547;as a movie fan, it troubles me that people actually liked this movie, as there is nothing worthwhile about it.
I:334;548;I saw this movie at the theaters and I thougt that is was really good.
I:334;549;This movie is sooo good.
I:334;550;I thank that the caracthers are likeable if you think about what their going throught.
I:334;551;And I think the cabin looks really good.
I:334;552;this movie is really good.
I:334;553;i loved the fact Rider Strong was in it.
I:334;554;the concept of the movie was great but the writers didnt play it out well.
I:334;555;i really had high hopes for it.
I:334;556;This movie is a fantastic watch if you enjoy comedic horror.
I:334;557;This movie isnt scary and doesnt take itself seriously.
I:334;558;par acting that manages to captivate the audience.
I:334;559;"In spite of everything working against it, ""Evil Dead 2"" has a masterful mix of humor, heart, and terror."
I:334;560;"The way that the music works, and the way that the shots are set up (self admitted by the director) ""borrow"" from many other horror movies."
I:334;561;In other words, in my opinion, he played it safe.
I:334;562;If you listen to the commentary track, you know that the movie was an effort of love.
I:334;563;He loves the horror genre.
I:334;564;Speaking of the commentary track, if you are a young aspiring director, then even if you don't like horror, the commentary track is very informative.
I:334;565;"Though this movie is terribly flawed in the plot, it still has a few good scares, and works on a ""thriller"" level."
I:334;566;The gore effects are very decent, and the score is wonderful (almost too good, honestly).
I:334;567;Is it the best horror movie in the last 10 years?
I:334;568;Not even close, but it is pretty good for what it tries to do.
I:334;569;Aww, one last treat before he rots away on his hospital bed.
I:334;570;Giuseppe Andrews and James Debello steal the show here as they both did in Detroit Rock City.
I:334;571;this film (though it is entertaining at times)is WAY overrated.
I:334;572;The best things about the film are Angelo Badelamenti's (Blue Velvet) beautiful score and some of the random humor (i. e. karate and pancakes , shaving with a razor in the bathtub, and the mad dog.)
I:334;573;Supposed homage to past horror films lacks originality flavor, though it has fun with it's gruesome blood soaked flesh virus scenes.
I:334;574;*Why did they cast people like Joey Kern who couldn't act his way out of a strait jacket?But, the biggest bonus of this film is the beautiful love them written by the wonderful Angelo Badalamenti (TWIN PEAKS).
I:334;575;It's gorgeous and provides the film's biggest shock as Rider Strong plays touchy feely with Jordan Ladd.
I:334;576;or maybe just pleasantly distracted by Cerina Vincent's chest.
I:334;577;The Deputy Winston character is hilarious, and very quote worthy.
I:334;578;Oh, and the movie has the best ending of any other film hands down.
I:334;579;i recommend it for those who are age appropriate who want to find an unexpected source of dark humor in a horror film.
I:334;580;You have the hot chick, The nice girl, the hot guy, the nice guy, and the dumbass guy.
I:334;581;there is zero originality in the story line as well as the cinematography.
I:334;582;I just saw Eli Roth's new film, Hostel, on Friday and I thought it was a really good film.
I:334;583;This is actually a pretty unique horror film (flesh eating virus) and the location creates a nice atmosphere as well.
I:334;584;The acting is pretty good for the most part and the gore effects are top notch.
I:334;585;Hostel is a truly better film all around, but now I also enjoy Cabin Fever.
I:334;586;I don't have much to say as I'm tired, I just figured I'd contribute in getting this film's average score up, after all it was totally excellent.
I:334;587;At the recommendation of a fellow horror fan I decided to watch Cabin Fever .
I:334;588;It had such a funny twisted ending.
I:334;589;It will take you by suprise.
I:334;590;i recommend that you watch the 'making of featurette' before watching the film, it will clue you in on a few things, and will help you to appreciate the work the director and actors put into this film.
I:334;591;It isn't a life altering movie, but it is pretty fun for what it is.
I:334;592;director Eli Roth clearly knows his horror movies, because this movie plunders a lot of them.
I:334;593;campy fun, retro Evil Dead pastiche or straight horror.
I:334;594;I was recommended the movie by quite a few Evil Dead enthusiasts, so it would appear to work on that level.
I:334;595;Saying that, some of the gags definitely work, especially the anti.
I:334;596;The unknown cast are all great value for money, though you suspect that we'll probably never see them again.
I:334;597;There are also enough good moments to suggest that Roth could make a much more consistently good movie in future.
I:334;598;This movie is so incredible I don't know where to start.
I:334;599;grimm, Deputy Winston and Dennis are probably the best 3 written and acted characters ever in the history of moving pictures.
I:334;600;so expecting that, one can pick out great qualities.
I:334;601;this movie combines everything a present horror movie should have.
I:334;602;audience movies), a whole lot of laughs (the kind that may or may not of been intended, random, and plain old humor), and a bunch of twenty.
I:334;603;I saw this film a few years ago and wanted to see it again after watching Roth's later works in the Hostel films.
I:334;604;This one is full of blood and some good laughs, even though I would have liked it to have a more serious ending.
I:334;605;the cast is decent with a little nudity and lots of blood for good measure.
I:334;606;high school kids, the acting was superb and the story was excellent.
I:334;607;Even though it had a very unsatisfying ending (all of the kids contracting the plague and dissolving in red puddles of protoplams), the film was quirky, riveting and hugely entertaining.
I:334;608;It is basically a tribute to the horror genre from the 70's and 80's with intentional rip.
I:334;609;the story may sound simple, and while it is, it is entertaining enough to keep the audience engaged for 89 minutes.
I:334;610;i give the story 3 stars, the acting 4 stars and the movie making 5 stars.
I:334;611;This is the best example of outstanding movie making in a horror movie I have witnessed for a long time.
I:334;612;The cinematography is excellent, so is the music score and the editing.
I:334;613;Roth is right up there with Wes Craven and John Carpenter in the same genre in movie making.
I:334;614;The special features are also excellent with a good commentary, teasers and trailer, an entertaining 'making of', a Q session with Eli Roth, 3 animations and hidden features as well.
I:334;615;this is not just a movie for stoned teenagers, it will appeal to all fans of the horror genre, especially those who appreciate exceptional movie making.
I:334;616;Cabin Fever does have it's share of good points though: the performances from Detroit Rock City co. stars James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews are funny and help carry the film along, and there is plenty of blood and guts, and the scene where one of the girls who is contagious decides to shave her legs is gut churning.
I:334;617;Cabin Fever is still worth a look for older horror fans who enjoyed other recent Lions Gate horror films like House of 1000 Corpses, May, and Frailty, but don't go in with high expectations.
I:334;618;making it one of the more professional looking independent movies ever made.
I:334;619;Is it a fun horror flick.
I:334;620;An idea which actually came from a real.
I:334;621;easily the dumbest of the complaints.
I:334;622;the fact still remains, the basic plot is original, Roth just pays tribute to those that came before him throughout it in little ways.
I:334;623;It is just a matter of taste, I found it hilarious, my friend did not.
I:334;624;One thing that has to be said about the movie is the amount of Gross.
I:334;625;there are a lot of moments that will make you cringe.
I:334;626;overall I loved the movie.
I:334;627;A big fan of the genre?
I:334;628;In fact dont bother, it still wouldnt be worth it.
I:334;629;After watching this movie however I can say that I would highly recommend it, especially to fans of 70's horror.
I:334;630;This movie turns out to be a delightful mix of gore, dark humor, and fear of rednecks, c'mon who isn't afraid of rednecks.
I:334;631;A worthwhile film from a new director, give it a shot.
I:334;632;Watching this, it should be pretty clear.
I:334;633;there are plenty of throwbacks to the campy horror movies we loved or loathed in the past, but this is more of a parody on the genre, the perfect setup for an unstoppable gore fest that makes itself entertaining.
I:334;634;Contemporary and witty on its own right, I wouldn't recommend this to a lot of people.
I:334;635;There is probably a small audience that loves this movie, I can probably see why, but I don't connect with that reasoning.
I:334;636;You know a movie is in trouble when the trailer starts something like this: Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy says this movie is good!
I:334;637;Because you see, the Lord of the Rings was good.
I:334;638;Peter Jackson directed Lord of the Rings.
I:334;639;hey, I just thought of a new stunt they can do on Fear Factor next season.
I:334;640;each other!Eli Roth is going to be a good director.
I:334;641;It is one of the better horror around and IMO is a lot better than My Little Eye.
I:334;642;The movie is a good idea: a strange disease destroying the flesh of the people, it's in the water, and the starrings are in deep America.
I:334;643;I'm sure they will make a second part.
I:334;644;I will tell you what makes this movie so great:>>>Think about it.
I:334;645;>>>>The way they acted toward each other.
I:334;646;It was just so real how they turned on each other.
I:334;647;their mannerism toward each other was so realistic.
I:334;648;they throw her in a shed and lock her up and she basically rots away>>This part I really can't type it here so I will try to use proper words.
I:334;649;Funny but people in a state of panic would probably do such a thing.
I:334;650;he gets it in the end.
I:334;651;i am a horror movie fanatic and I just thought this was great all the way around.
I:334;652;This movie was filled with so much potential and scares and everything good needed to make a truly scary horror movie but it was all shot away when some unkown director HAD to add humor into the mix.
I:334;653;When you go to see a horror movie you go to get scared!
I:334;654;This movie had a good cast, a great score and a great idea.
I:334;655;this movie could have become a good movie quite possibly a classic but NO.
I:334;656;I loved this film it was surprising and above everything else it did disturb me.
I:334;657;I was shocked in parts and laughed heaps too.
I:334;658;It does remind me of such films as Evil Dead but its very clever and its more of a ride than a movie!
I:334;659;overall this movie has got the strings which will make you hover in the edge of the seat,even if not for the whole duration,for a sizable time frame.
I:334;660;if you want to experience a change from the usual flicks in which the hero or the heroine ,most of the times it is the heroine,tries to escape from the monster after all of her friends are massacred by the chasing predator.
I:334;661;here you can see how the human beings mercilessly treat one another when their lives are at stake.
I:334;662;"It's not a ""brilliant"" horror flick or anything but I was entertained the whole time."
I:334;663;If you like B. horror movies then you will like this one.
I:334;664;It has dark humor, enough blood and gore, decent enough acting and attractive characters.
I:334;665;One word Shower and you'll know what I am talking about.
I:334;666;This is a must see.
I:334;667;the laughs come not too often, and the seriousness of the situation brings a strange sensation for fear, when you realize.
I:334;668;great scenery, descent acting, better than most other zombie genre films.
I:334;669;I saw this film with a friend.
I:334;670;When it popped up on cable, I watched it again and liked it a lot more.
I:334;671;I think it is worth a watch.
I:334;672;"I found some pretty clever situations in an otherwise formulaic take on ""kids in the woods"" stories."
I:334;673;"core slasher freaks
I:334;674;"Creepy fun
I:334;675;This is a good movie.
I:334;676;"So what does she do she decides to ""enjoy"" herself with that geek from Boy Meets World (now they could have done without him)."
I:334;677;But more than that this is a good movie for a low budget one.
I:334;678;Cabin Fever (Eli Roth, 2002)In retrospect, I have to say this is the best movie of its kind I've ever seen.
I:334;679;"the best part about this movie is playing ""spot the homage."""
I:334;680;There's also a handful of fun special effects (Roth is from the Hideshi Hino school of gore, never a bad thing), comic relief, some decent acting from the cast of rising stars, gratuitous nudity and violence, and, in general, everything you want from a brainless horror film.
I:334;681;What makes this movie even more well scary is that the first half is actually funny.
I:334;682;Cabin Fever is actually smart, considering it concerns a bunch of college kids who party in a secluded forest location.
I:334;683;It actually makes sense, and the characters are actually [gasp] smart!
I:334;684;I know smart characters in a horror movie may seem strange, but it is one of the reasons why Cabin Fever is such a good movie.
I:334;685;This movie more than earns it R rating.
I:334;686;I enjoyed the blonde guy getting shot up, and when the dog ate the brunette I liked that too.
I:334;687;Also this movie keeps going on and on.
I:334;688;the suspense will be you guessing when it will finally end.
I:334;689;what makes this a good movie?
I:334;690;that is, it's completely unrealistic: it's for fun.
I:334;691;but overall the scenes are well shot with good suspense.
I:334;692;A creative look at horror where the bad guy isn't a killer but a disease, that starts to make the infected look like the bad guy.
I:334;693;It was fun, all the plot you need is beware of the sickness, each other, and run/fight/survive/argue!
I:334;694;then might as well be from the best in the genre.
I:334;695;the movie has a great set up, a great idea, and a great feel to it.
I:334;696;I will agree with most people.
I:334;697;This movie was absolutely dismal!
I:334;698;Nothing is more fun than sitting around and making fun of how bad something is.
I:334;699;The pancakes scene is so hilarious you won't stop laughing for hours.
I:334;700;This is a disturbing film with elements of dark comedy, but an otherwise entertaining movie.
I:334;701;the main characters turn on one another to keep from getting the flesh.
I:334;702;Horror fans will love this movie.
I:334;703;People who are squeamish will absolutely loath this movie.
I:334;704;But if you can stomache a little gore, Cabin Fever is quite entertaining and has so much to offer.
I:334;705;There was so much about this movie that did not make sense that in the end it is really quite beautiful.
I:334;706;I found it truly memorable.
I:334;707;up the sound in this film!
I:334;708;especially with the sheer amount of profanity used by many of the members of the group, which almost gives the film something of a parodical element.
I:334;709;The acting was actually quite good if you bear in mind when watching this movie that the actors are supposed to act cheesily because they are paying homage to horror flicks of the past.
I:334;710;The originality of this horror film's plot raises its viewing value.
I:334;711;Its subject matter would definitely hold a viewer's attention.
I:334;712;She seems to be melting.
I:334;713;cabin Fever was great compared to the second.
I:334;714;It gives you a sense of suspends that wasn't present in the second.
I:334;715;i really enjoyed Rider Strong performance.
I:334;716;He was the right choice for the lead character and the other actors gave great supporting performances too.
I:334;717;it most definitely was NOT good.
I:334;718;"a horror movie that had an awesome plot that I loved right away was ""The Ring""."
I:334;719;Cabin Fever is great and it has the elements of tense scary moments and also some funny ones too!!!!!
I:334;720;I think that Eli Roth did a wonderful job on directing this great horror flick and Rider Strong did a great job by keeping his shirt off twice in the movie!!!!!!!!
I:334;721;The special features are great watching too!!!!!!!
I:334;722;The kid that plays Dennis, the boy who bites, rocks out.
I:334;723;Its true that every time a unique and clever movie finally sneaks into theaters most people either ignore it or simply wright it off from a bad trailer.
I:334;724;For anyone who has been awaiting a modern day Evil Dead return, this is it!
I:334;725;The Writer/Producer/Director Eli Roth is truly a gifted filmmaker.
I:334;726;He took a recyled horror movie formula and added a whole new artistic even independent film feel to it.
I:334;727;for all you David Lynch and Twin Peaks fans this may interest you as well.
I:334;728;In my opinion Cavin Fever has finally done what movie fans have wanted for years.
I:334;729;This was an entertaining movies and parts were definately creepy and made you jump in your seat.
I:334;730;It even has chick vision so that the scariest scenes will disappear.
I:334;731;Instead of running around and selling himself as the new hope for horror films (the guys does four commentarys (!)
I:334;732;Cabin Fever is somewhat of a cult classic that has been floating around since 2003.
I:334;733;This film is also an early work of rising writer/director Eli Roth which lets you know it's going to be a very over the top gorefest, which we usually aren't crazy about, but figured it works well being the Halloween time of year.
I:334;734;Since they don't let him in Harry the Hermit jumps in the car and tries to steal it.
I:334;735;It was one of the most bizzare scenes but very hilarious.
I:334;736;The rest of the film is filled with laughs and confusion.
I:334;737;We can't give this one a strong recommendation but will say it may be worth it for some laughs.
I:334;738;If you're a gore lover you should really like this one.
I:334;739;This movie definitely belongs in the comedy section of horror movies.
I:334;740;It is definitely entertaining if you watch it with some of your best buds.
I:334;741;"It does not belong with the greats but it is just a fun film that may reach a cult status just like ""The Stuff."""
I:334;742;the movie had better potential than what it actually was on film.
I:334;743;At the same time, it was a great movie that I actually enjoyed.
I:334;744;One of the things that makes Cabin Fever a genuinely fun outing for horror fans is the cast and crew's obvious enthusiasm for what they're doing.
I:334;745;"Even without viewing the entertaining (if rather short on substance) ""Making of"" featurette, you can easily tell that the film was a labor of love with a game cast."
I:334;746;which would undoubtedly have made for a fascinating story.
I:334;747;the movie is (almost) enough of a delight to make up for it.
I:334;748;"cabin Fever takes pretty much every convention of ""classic"" drive."
I:334;749;in horror films of the 70's, and manages to make them look new again.
I:334;750;conscious winks to the audience, the walking cliches of Cabin Fever seem to enjoy playing their roles to the hilt, with performances that are as much tribute as spoof.
I:334;751;One of the most entertaining aspects of the film is that the lead characters, each a counterpart of a 70's.
I:334;752;Instead of counting on us to hope that the smug hipster, the ice queen, and the obnoxious jock manage to escape the killer's clutches, we can finally enjoy seeing them get what we thought they deserved all along.
I:334;753;the most striking thing about the film is its big.
I:334;754;The directing is confident, the performances are strong, the effects are convincing, and the photography is excellent (unlike most of its ancestors).
I:334;755;It belies its independent origins every step of the way, right down to the Angelo Badalamenti score (the composer's hilarious account of his involvement with the film is one of the featurette's high points).
I:334;756;Most highly recommended to horror fans with a sense of humor.
I:334;757;A pleasant enough addition, but they aren't really anything to get excited about.
I:334;758;commentary tracks could probably have been boiled down into just one or two, but their easygoing tone adds to feeling of good.
I:334;759;natured fun that went into the production.
I:334;760;I really disliked this movie.
I:334;761;There were good scenes with good makeup effects.
I:334;762;The movie is about a group of friends who go up to a cabin for a mini vacation.
I:334;763;Each one wonders who will be next.
I:334;764;Horrilble in every way possible.
I:334;765;If you like good films .
I:334;766;If, on the other hand, you don't mind a clever spoof of the genre then you'll find a well executed example here.
I:334;767;'This movie is utterly enjoyable as a comedy.
I:334;768;"of and commentary, plus a ""family friendly version"" (I kid you not) of the film."
I:334;769;the best movie of 2003.
I:334;770;not only the best horror movie, but.
I:334;771;Cabin fever packs a HUGE punch, a seriously funny/disturbing story line and delivers an insane/comedy/gory/action filled movie.
I:334;772;Go see it right the heck now (For your fathers sake).
I:334;773;it is fun and absolutely riveting in the way only a well made horror flick can be.
I:334;774;Sure it's gory, but in a much more creative and stylish manner than your typical teenage slasher.
I:334;775;horror movies that are this fun and engaging are few and far between.
I:334;776;fans to the classic true horror fans.
I:334;777;In the featurette, you see that this film is clearly a labor of love for everyone involved.
I:334;778;I can see potential though.
I:334;779;If he continues to do nostalgic, exploitation horror flicks, he could certainly crank out a winner.
I:334;780;This is probely one of my favorite movies.
I:334;781;it's a pretty scary movie and its funny too.
I:334;782;The point they're missing is that the entire movie is making fun of 70's cheezy horror flicks, if you watch the extras Eli Roth even says it himself.
I:334;783;I found myself laughing through most of the movie instead of being scared.
I:334;784;This is one of Eli's first releases that received actual attention in the horror genre and is what you can thank or blame (depending on your taste) on his continued acquisition of a budget for his films.
I:334;785;clearly a group of real winners.
I:334;786;It's a great mix of 80's slasher flick campiness and a good outbreak film.
I:334;787;Eli delivers in spades in this one combining humor, horror, and hillbilies .
I:334;788;even adding in a governemnt agency that helps to crack down on the outbreak.
I:334;789;But over all, I think this movie feels really fresh and I thought it was a hoot.
I:334;790;it is, and it's funny.
I:334;791;I loved watching these people self.
I:334;792;And the ending is just absolutely Bizzare and should have you laughing your a$$ off.
I:334;793;Check it out, it's worth a couple of viewings.
I:334;794;The only thing that saves if from mediocrety is its originality.
I:334;795;In my eyes this movie is 10x better than Hostel and many other horror films made around the last few years.
I:334;796;Its a fun, thrill you, make you piss your pants type film.
I:334;797;Just gory fun is the best way to describe it.
I:334;798;I really loved the effects in the film and the acting.
I:334;799;Its just a fun horror flick.
I:334;800;It succeeds as that very much.
I:334;801;I enjoyed it a lot.
I:334;802;Rider Strong from Boy in the World graced us with his first appearance since like 1994.
I:334;803;By the way, I remember seeing a womans name (Anna Jackson?)
I:334;804;It is an entertaining horror film that I thoroughly enjoyed.
I:334;805;Cabin Fever is a great thriller.
I:334;806;"None of the performances will garner the actors Oscar nods, but the producers main goal was to scare and shock the audience out of their seats
I:334;807;I laughed more than I jumped or was creeped out.
I:334;808;at the core, it's a disgustingly great fear the movie is working with.
I:334;809;Paranoia and fear tear the group apart as they start turning on each other.
I:334;810;"He infuses the story with very interesting characters like Dennis, the catatonic, bite you if you come too close, blonde kid, a cop who calls the main protagonist ""party man,"" the stoner who says ""ooooh, faced,"" and other equally funny characters."
I:334;811;"In fact, the movie becomes more of a campy fun ride than a ""serious"" horror film."
I:334;812;Also, Peter Jackson calls it the best horror film of the year.
I:334;813;and then I realized that Peter Jackson is also known for Dead Alive, a wickedly funny zombie movie that is one of the goriest movies I've seen.
I:334;814;we are constantly quoting it.
I:334;815;A masterpiece of the genre, it's not.
I:334;816;But, I'd recommend checking this movie out once more and give it one more chance.
I:334;817;"Look at it not as the ""scariest horror movie ever"" but as a campy fun time (with some genuinely disgusting moments) and I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
I:334;818;This movie is also really funny, and I wish the director would have kept going with this humour, as this movie could have been better than it was.
I:334;819;The comedy is the strongest parts of this film, as there is little or no actual scariness here, since the bloodletting is more humorous than anything.
I:334;820;the cast here is decent, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible.
I:334;821;door, the funny guy, the jock and the weakling who proves to be courageous by the end.
I:334;822;I'd heard a lot of good word of mouth about this movie and was curious to see it.
I:334;823;eating bacteria and the movie is creative about how this gory bug brings out the worst in its stock characters.
I:334;824;The script has fun with horror film conventions and the typical characters found in them.
I:334;825;or at least fun in the hands of these writers.
I:334;826;good acting, you'll be rolling.
I:334;827;gets an extra star cause u get to see a hot girls breasts a couple of times
I:334;828;The psychological aspect is well written.
I:334;829;The acting is pretty good, too.
I:334;830;The characters felt genuine because they were all squirrley.
I:334;831;All the small town people somewhere in the sticks get a good slice of reality, whether or not they face it.
I:334;832;The dialog was good, if a little overloaded with profanity.
I:334;833;It really hit a good nail on the head.
I:334;834;Again, the psychological aspect was well written.
I:334;835;i give the movie four stars because there are some really colorful characters involved.
I:334;836;the setting is really good, really perfect for the event.
I:334;837;But they did not deal with it well and honestly, I think that's pretty realistic.
I:334;838;Director Eli Roth deserves mention, too .
I:334;839;not for his direction, mind you, nor for his cameo appearance as a local stoner, but for seemingly having so much fun making the film.
I:334;840;If you haven't seen it, please do.
I:334;841;"The ""partying"" cop is one of the creepiest guys I've ever seen."
I:334;842;Bought this as a gift for my girl friend.
I:334;843;Shipping time was as expected, and overall it was a good choice.
I:334;844;cheek and meant to be seen by a group of friends (preferably a group of young men who have seen Evil Dead 2 about 100 times each) and just laughed at.
I:334;845;Ever since Scream the horror audience has become bigger and dumber.
I:334;846;It's just a fun, quirky, and independent horror film made to give pleasure to those who can truly appreciate a fun horror movie for what it is.
I:334;847;but even I have to draw a line somewhere.
I:334;848;Roth eventually delivers some memorable moments, such as the bloody bathtub shaving scene, but the serious gore seems to be a long time in coming.
I:334;849;bottom line, this movie has laughs, gore, and a story line that keeps your attention.
I:334;850;But if you're tired of boring sequels like Halloween Resurrection, this is well worth your time.
I:334;851;I liked this movie for all the wrong reasons.
I:334;852;Fratboy, in amazing violation of all movie cliches, figures it's not wise to touch the man slowly losing his skin.
I:334;853;But how they go, that's just delicious!
I:334;854;The two girls, slutty and precious, slowly rot until one is a skeleton and the other is devoured by dogs.
I:334;855;Because you see, the rifle really was for them .
I:334;856;The performances are satisfactory and the humour is piled on heavily which works well as a contrast to all the gore.
I:334;857;wall good horror with some humor.
I:334;858;breeding evident in the local town.
I:334;859;The part with the girl shaving her legs really makes me happy I have an electric shaver.
I:334;860;ewwwww!The townfolk hillbillies are great, especially little Dennis and the store owner.
I:334;861;it is the smart, unexpected humor and character development that pull this movie out of the crowd.
I:334;862;It was hyped by critics loving it and a lot of good word.
I:334;863;It is a kind of realistic and believable film.
I:334;864;The infection is natural and gradual.
I:334;865;But the acting is still top notch.
I:334;866;They do a pretty good job of acting being freaked out and seeing their friends become walking talking skinned alive beings due to the infestation of the virus.
I:334;867;Also an insane county policeman and an insane police kind of gives it that freaky unreal touch that the movie needs.
I:334;868;We get a pretty attractive female lead with an ample and athletic figure.
I:334;869;Eli always gets in a sex scene or two into his movies.
I:334;870;The very end of the movie is pretty funny though, i have to admit.
I:334;871;This is one of the funniest and most well.
I:334;872;done horror movies I can recall.
I:334;873;Not only does it pay homage to all of the best horror films that came before, but it does so with such humor and over.
I:334;874;top grossness that you can't help but laugh yourself silly.
I:334;875;Eli Roth has a terrific eye for detail(and a hilarious cameo, I might add) and does a great job with his strong cast of actors.
I:334;876;"i look forward to Eli Roth's next project with great anticipation
I:334;877;Aside from that, Cabin Fever had genuine scares and was quite fresh in its approach to the horror genre.
I:334;878;this movie had some strong points and a weakness!
I:334;879;and the casting, well, it's half movie weakness and half it's power both!
I:334;880;anyway I bought it cause it's worth for me and I can watch it occasionally, but for you, I can't recommand.
I:334;881;I had pretty high expectations for Cabin Fever.
I:334;882;Sound and picture are sharp.
I:334;883;I can't even recommend this movie to the most hard core horror fan.
I:334;884;Cabin Fever has become somewhat of a modern cult film due to its eccentricities and Roth's later notoriety.
I:334;885;The plot is good, as are other items, but the film leaves a lot to be desired, unless of course you're not looking for much intelligence or authentic horror and just want a fun, quasi.
I:334;886;I admit that the main reason I bought this disk is the beautiful Cerina Vincent.
I:334;887;"As good as she looks in ""Cabin Fever"" she's far more gorgeous in later films like 2006's ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and 2005's ""It Waits,"" where she's more curvy with a fuller mane."
I:334;888;The picture's eccentricities are enjoyable, such as the weirdo party.
I:334;889;"Don't get me wrong here because I actually prefer realistic cussing in the films I view
I:334;890;In light of this it's very rare that I would complain about cussing in a movie.
I:334;891;eli Roth directorial debut on the big screen.
I:334;892;asia Film Festival in 2003 (Eli Roth) and Best Make.
I:334;893;Thsi is honestly a very interesting movie.
I:334;894;it is a well made, run.
I:334;895;mill that got that extra bit of care that horror has been missing for so long.
I:334;896;The trick in any horror flick is that it must provide the audience with characters to care about so that when they eventually get killed, it adds more of an anticipation and suspense to the plot.
I:334;897;Its a wonder how bad movies get made but it is pure comedy.
I:334;898;It sucks but its worth a look.
I:334;899;The Ring received a great deal of hype and because of that it became just a decent to Average Film to those expecting more.
I:334;900;Friday the 13th eat your heart out!
I:334;901;"Cabin Fever is a good ""first"" movie for a director."
I:334;902;I think that is one of his strong points and I would watch any movie he puts out because of this.
I:334;903;It mixed horror with some comedy and that was it's strong points.
I:334;904;It has some funny quotes and the end was unlike typical horror movies.
I:334;905;On a critical film standpoint, I give Eli Roth the director props for a good looking film with some substance and I think he has potential for future movies.
