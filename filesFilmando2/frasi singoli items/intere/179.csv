id;spiegazione
1;I bought this film thinking it would be interesting .
2;and I love a mystery.
3;And that strange Halloween party with the cryptic performances .
4;Brendan is devoted to his love, Emily Kostich, and will do anything to protect her.
5;She is killed and Brendan finds her washed in a creek near an underground tunnel.
6;The young actors are so convincing that you get the impression that the high school they populate is one big, organized crime syndicate.
7;One sharp scene is where Brendan roughly negotiates with the school Vice Principal (Richard Roundtree of the first 'Shaft' film fame).
8;In the midst of the murder there are love interests and notes that provide clues in Brendan's investigation.
9;It is gripping and has all the anticipation of a whodunit with some violent, but convincing fight scenes.
10;It is an artful enterprise with editing and music that underscores the nerve.
11;'Brick' is an effective and often startling teenage murder mystery with a earnest cast and an intelligent script.
12;Rian Johnston deserves praises for his screenplay and directing skill.
13;Joseph is amazing in this unusual flick, between the angstrom teen parallel and the kitschy dark humor it is now one of my absolute favorites.
14;As someone who's actually read Dashiell Hammett, I found this movie fantastic.
15;Putting the classic 'mystery novel' language from Hammett's work into a film based in HIGH SCHOOL was so completely fun to watch.
16;I was surprised how much I loved this film when I first watched it, and now it's easily one of my favorite films to watch.
17;a twist on an old classic made modern by muttering teens .
18;to those who can get past any those will have a film that plays with the conventions it's handed and comes out pretty good, even though the ending isn't as detective.
19;Yes, Brandon is a convention of the story, but so is everyone in the story we call life.
20;Does he have realistic qualities to his character and is what happens to him possible for others as well?
21;I find the story realistic, high schools are battle grounds where violence can and does take place, both in the limelight and out.
22;It's funny, cleverly plays around the conventions and contains textbook noir performances which are more reliant on wordplay than expression, although a little more expression would be nice.
23;To sum up this entire review and how I feel about it: It's imperfect, but it works well.
24;I think it was an excellent movie about how childhood experiences can effect your entire life.
25;I love this movie so much.
26;The way they speak, the characters, the plot, everything.
27;The dialog made sense within the world of the film because that world is, as everyone has said, high school layered with Casablanca.
28;This movie is an excellent effort in an unusual direction.
29;The acting is surprisingly good, the characters are intelligent, and for the most part they're unusually mature for teenage characters in an American movie.
30;Not a perfect movie, but a great one.
31;`Brick' is one of those films that has aged very well with me.
32;I remember when I first say it and I really liked it a lot.
33;With dialog as fresh and sharp as the words expressed in `Juno', yet more residual thanks to the noir'ish themes, `Brick' just `gets it'.
34;i love the feel of `Brick'.
35;This is a film that knows what it wants to be.
36;It indulges in and totally embraces the thickly detailed atmosphere that makes it stand alone, apart from comparables.
37;Instead, it balances the absurd details of the surroundings by elevating the core themes, keeping each character believable as apposed to a cleverly inserted caricature.
38;rian Johnson is just, well, awesome.
39;taking place mainly on school grounds, `Brick' tells the story of Brendan, a curious teen who gets a message from his girlfriend claiming to need help.
40;Taking that message and running with it, Brendan finds himself deep in high.
41;levitt adds so much weight to the films premise, aiding Brendan with a subtle edge that makes him believable and relatable.
42;Megan Good and Mike O'Leary are also great
43;She was just outstanding, layering her characters mysteriousness with richly conceived moments that spark our interest.
44;thanks to a poetic script and a sharp directorial eye, `Brick' is the new age noir that understands how to pay homage without feeling like a cheaply disguised copycat.
45;No, this is not the best noir ever (as some presumptuous teens have tried to claim) but it is one of the smartest takes on the genre in years.
46;The noir is a hard genre to master, but `Brick' just oozes with enough charm and originality to take the cake here.
47;fascinating is a word that best describes this film.
48;It is so incredibly clever by blending noir with High.
49;It thus creates a sort of milk and cookies noir genre, which I find absolutely fascinating.
50;The story is intriguing and the script is airtight.
51;Try a whole two hours of chatter like that as fast as you can pronounce the words and understanding all the metaphors.
52;[It helped to put subtitles/captions on and watch the film more than once to catch/comprehend all the lines.]
53;The music is haunting and intoxicating, and the characters are as classical and perfectly cast as they are laughable.
54;But, this film has potential.
55;the SOUNDTRACK is a set of 40 pieces mainly composed by the artsy direction of (unknown to me) Nathan Johnson which includes the few potent tracks I really liked.
56;with its haunting cowbells and Laura's theme.
57;aka the smooth detective/seductress lounge music are among the best for both casual parties and background music for other films of this nature.
58;life, charismatic and virtually unstoppable protagonists, and both are propelled by fast, sharp, intelligent dialogue.
59;Although obviously conscious of the film's lack of realism the director never lets his guard down, and these extremely articulate, focused, serious and animally elegant teenagers remain strangely believable throughout.
60;There are a couple of buffyesque moments, like when the mysterious villain's mom prepares a nice snack for the boys and the noir mood just switches off for a few seconds, but the film simply returns intact to its previous intensity.
61;Incongruous and unbelievable as most dreams, the film has the same ability to hold the viewer's attention regardless.
62;This was a fascinating film.
63;This film would be one recommended to people who like British gritty crime dramas (see above).
64;As those are some I like very much, this was a film I really enjoyed seeing.
65;It is very very good.
66;Brick is a slick, stylized thriller about a young man trying to piece together the puzzle that's left after his love is killed.
67;levitt plays the lead and he does a fantastic job playing the Sam Spade of the movie.
68;The film has a lot of references to crime films of the 40s, including dialogue and characters.
69;The supporting cast does a great job, particularly Lukas Haas as Pin and the femme fatale of the movie.
70;If you like crime films, pulp movies, and detective stories, this is a movie more than worth the effort.
71;boiled noir genre to a high school setting is completely successful on its own terms.
72;there are a lot of things to savor in this film, but the main one is the dialogue.
73;(Be sure to turn on the subtitles to get their full flavor.)
74;For some reason, I loved the way that the high school seems perennially deserted.
75;But I had enjoyed myself so much up to that point, I was willing to forgive anything.
76;I found myself liking the movie immensely and being able to keep up with everything in spite of the jargon/slang.
77;A bit obsseive compulsive on my part but I wanted to get every wonderful word and nuance.
78;Exceptional acting with an exceptional musical score.
79;I must say that when I saw this, and probably still to this day, Brick was one of the most outstanding films I had seen in years.
80;gritty, violent, sometimes baffling, the film works better than I think anyone could expect and better than it has any right to.
81;unreservedly recommended to fans of film noir, detective stories and, yes, Veronica Mars.
82;The script, the directing, the acting, the music, the timing, the tricks.
83;Honestly, I thought it was fantastic and the story itself is great.
84;This is the way a startling percentage of the population of this country grows up.
85;The language is strong, forceful and brilliant, and the settings dark, drug.
86;Pulling heavily from noir films of old, this updated look and story has a unique place amongst the genre.
87;The level of sophistication is upped to extreme levels, showing us a danger and intellect amongst the teen population never before seen on celluloid.
88;the noir comparisons are the most fascinating.
89;There's even a piano playing portion that obviously pays homage to the Play it again, Sam lovers.
90;shot on location at San Clemente High School (the directors alma mater) and edited on a home computer, this amazing flick will win audiences over with its wonderful camera angles, dark themes and excellent script.
91;it has the feel of an inde film with the art style and moremoose
92;And yet, it really delivered the goods.
93;The script was fantastic, and the actors were as well.
94;Nevertheless, this is a really original movie that will appeal to anyone who likes a good story and a well.
95;The fact that the setting and style fit together so well ends up being quite a pay off and makes the story that much more intriguing and enjoyable.
96;levitt is excellent as loner hero Brendan Fry and perfectly fits the noir detective archetype
97;Brendan's character calls to mind a number of noir heroes, but perhaps most interestingly is an homage to the protagonist of Miller's Crossing in a series of scenes that hilariously feature Brendan taking beating after beating in very quick succession.
98;While most of the film maintains a slow, deliberate pace familiar to the genre, one scene in particular, in which Brendan is being chased by an unknown thug, is brilliantly directed and delievers a classic wow moment.
99;The conclusion also features the watermark of its influences as it is fairly easy to predict the who, just not the why.
100;A wonderful film that succeeds in nearly all respects, Brick is the most enjoyable detective film to come along in years and gives the world a new upcoming writer/director to watch.
101;This is a fantastic, unexpectedly well made crime noir drama that will keep you guessing what happened until the end.
102;This move is high tension and is slick in style and dialogue.
103;All of the actors are great and I honestly can't say one bad thing about this movie.
104;If crime movies, mysteries, or noir is your thing this is a must.
105;There is the central event of this film.
106;Despite this, the film remains an involving story, and well worth viewing again.
107;Originally made with a high school cast and written by a high schooler himself Brick is re.
108;casted with B actors who act well above the roles they've been given to this point.
109;A true throw back to noir while making the change of adding color and pulling it off Brick is an excellent movie all around.
110;In the end you will feel good about the adventure of the movie, despite its hard and dark edge.
111;Brick is a modern day film noir set in a high school in California.
112;Sure the characters speak in a way that's not like real life, but the true gem of this movie is it's brilliant storytelling with likeable characters that don't seem too far fetched.
113;The pin is the crimeboss with some quirky personality traights.
114;this movie is definately one worth watching just to see the spin that is put onto the characters, for instance: a scene that involves Brendan being treated to a meal by the Pin's mother just after he was beaten in their cellar.
115;It's an interesting idea and works incredibly well for the tone of the movie.
116;this is an excellent movie worth every amount of praise it receives, and I am personally looking forward to more from Rian Johnson.
117;But a good storyline and fast shipping though.
118;The best film of the year, with a powerful performance by Joseph Gordon.
119;Anyone who has seen this movie will agree, Joseph Gordon.
120;levitt steals the screen, and you can be sure you will be seeing him in A LOT more movies.
121;Props for a strong cast, including the always watchable Joseph Gordon.
122;I actually got suckered into seeing this movie in the theatre, but that only lasted about a half an hour.
123;That is the real mystery in this movie.
124;Brick uses a familiar style to tell a convential story, but it all unfolds in an unconventional way.
125;It provides an involving story with rich characters, but in a strange way, those aren't the aspects we pay attention to.
126;And for those not familiar with either of the previously stated, it will never be clear, but you'll have fun watching it anyway.
127;Brick tells it's narrative in the Film Noir style and the result is somewhere between 'Memento' and 'L. a Confidential.
128;Brick has been directed by Rian Johnson, a first time director who clearly shows a talent for evoking mood and energy on the screen.
129;There is a scene that demonstrates this perfectly when a character named The Pin has cookies and juice served to him by his mother as he has a meeting with Brendan about 'the brick' of the film's title.
130;there are shocking moments in the film that surprised me.
131;Brendan occupies every moment of screen time and we know just what he knows when he knows it.
132;I will not say, but finding out sure is fun.
133;And, Drop me off at school.
134;Brick, an independent movie written and directed by Rian Johnson, is part stunt, part style and part energetic riff on gumshoe movies.
135;Movie references are dropped like names but with more subtlety.
136;it's part stunt, part style and part energetic riff on gumshoe movies.
137;television in 1996, knows what he's doing.
138;serious crackpot tribute to old gangster movies.
139;It works so well not just because Johnson is unusually gifted and slightly off the wall, but because of Joseph Gordon.
140;talking, resourceful and relentless Brendan Frye.
141;This particular homage covers a lot of Thirties ground.
142;She calls him and pleads for help.
143;His only ally is The Brain, a super nerd and friend who knows a lot and sometimes can link unexpected dots.
144;Soon we meet Laura, a high school femme fatale who can afford excellent manicures
145;The Pin knows heroin pays a lot better than a community college Associate of Arts degree.
146;Her cookies look really good.
147;Well, Emily will always have a place in his heart.
148;levitt manages all this with complete assurance.
149;Those who saw him inThe Lookout(2007) know just how fine and authentic an actor he is.
150;Sure, it's something of a stunt.
151;movie grows on you, at first I wasn't thrilled, but now I like it.
152;Great noir humor packed into one.
153;On the other hand, Brick is very stylized, in a film school sort of way.
154;Rian Johnson's critically acclaimed Brick on a shoestring budget of less than $500,000 surprisingly delivers considerable bang for the buck.
155;In up and coming director Rian Johnson's film Brick, audiences are treated to a truly unique and memorable mystery film.
156;Inspired by the literary work of the great detective novel writerDashiell Hammett, who is best known as the creator of Sam Spade and The Thin Man, Rian Johnson set out to create a hip, contemporary noir film.
157;Though the highly stylized dialogue limits the commercial accessibility of the film, it is arguably what gives the story its refreshing flavor.
158;importance, which is truly remarkable in itself.
159;social and extremely street savvy high school senior, receives a distressed phone call from his ex.
160;He goes to his brilliantly resourceful friend, Brain, who seems to have the dirt on just about everyone in school.
161;As the intrigue is elevated so too are Brendan's troubles.
162;Who knew that was even possible?Another great strength of the film is its use of atmospheric and highly evocative music.
163;the film features a talented young cast including Joseph Gordon.
164;The cast also features Meagan Good, and in a cameo role, Richard Roundtree ofShaftfame.
165;The entire cast is really spectacular, especially when you consider the difficulty of delivering such strange, stylized dialogue with a sense of sincerity.
166;This movie is beyond good.
167;Rian Johnson's debut film Brick caused something of a minor sensation among critics and discerning cineastes earlier this year when it won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, the John Cassavetes Award for the best film production with a budget under $500,000.
168;much like the Coen brothers film Miller's Crossing, Brick adopts stylized noir slang but in this case, contrasts it with a contemporary look that works surprisingly well.
169;The cast is uniformly excellent and handles Johnson's stylized prose perfectly.
170;To his credit, Johnson makes some fascinating choices in how he frames scenes and uses unusual close.
171;It's a movie that constantly keeps us guessing, not knowing what to expect next but he displays enough confidence in his direction that we trust him to take us wherever he wants.
172;Brick is an amazing debut film with an ingenuous premise and such a novel way of executing it that you find yourself immediately drawn into this world that Johnson has created.
173;They are both excellent and it is obvious why they got the roles.
174;This is solid commentary track filled with lots of good observations and fascinating information on how this movie was made.
175;This is mostly due to the cast of young actors who play their parts with sincerity and caution, not to appear too 'high.
176;levitt) gets a message from his ex.
177;girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin) claiming to need help of some sort he finds himself delving deep into the underground ring of high.
178;I've been a fan of Joseph's for a while now, favoring his brilliant work in Mysterious Skin over unworthy Oscar nominee Terrance Howard last year, and with 'Brick' Levitt continues to prove his weight in gold.
179;Meagan Good also turns out a convincing conniving manipulative tramp in the form of Drama Queen Kara, and Mike O'Leary does a great job as Brendan's confidant and friend The Brain.
180;the script is also a major plus, creating an almost poetic lingo for today's teens, giving the film an interesting perspective and leading to some very interesting conversations.
181;Since there are a lot of those it's good to have dialog that grabs you and holds your attention.
182;Some of the best dialog is shared between Brendan and The Brain, the both of them spitting off line after line fluently and effortlessly.
183;As far as plot boilers go 'Brick' pulls no punches and it delivers 100% giving us something new, fresh and unique, something that if done wrong could have been disastrous, but with a brilliant script and acting to boot 'Brick' easily becomes one of the most fascinating and memorable thrillers in the recent years.
184;The most fun I've had in a theater in years.
185;The dialogue is fast and clever.
186;I heard great reviews from some of my friends, and I really like Joseph Gordon.
187;All the cleverness absolutely overwhelms the film.
188;one other oddity I noticed: it's rated R, and yet I'm fairly sure I heard not a single obscenity, something that even some PG movies have.
189;As for violence, the hero gets punched a lot, and there's one.yes, arty.
190;Yes I will agree that Brick is clever and engaging to a point, but what point?
191;Dubious of PK's choice of movie, I was surprised when Brick turned out to be one the best movies I've seen this year.
192;this debut film from writer and director by Rian Johnson, is a stylized and clever film noir, where the teenaged cast speak in the jargon of the classic black and white films of the 1940's.
193;set in present day, but using the Shakespearean talk.
194;a winner of a film.
195;The trailer was very intriguing, so I was excited to watch this movie.
196;The actors mumbled a lot, too.
197;The writing and superb adaptation drops you into the story just like the novella the movie is based on.
198;At times, the poetic dialogue makes you forget that these are just kids and the subtle reminders of this fact add to the clever comedic moments.
199;brick is an amazing movie.
200;Definately the best written movie I have ever seen.
201;This movie has it all, on paper at least.
202;A great premise, a talented cast, great shots plus all the intrigue and mystery of a great film.
203;while the some of the actors really suprised me with their great performances.
204;There is one aspect of this film, that seperates it from many others.
205;It is the very creative dialogue used.
206;The casting was very well done!
207;Oh, and did I mention the music score.
208;One of my favorite movies of all time.
209;A great story to follow and well shot movie to boot.
210;This movie a great watch and JGL is phenomenal in it.
211;In addition to such celebrated, award.
212;but I stayed because I was riveted by the sinister mystery plot and touched by the heartache under hero Brendan's tough.
213;the actors play it straight, inhabiting their roles with emotions that ring true in or out of a crime movie.
214;Everybody's excellent, though I was particularly impressed with Joseph Gordon.
215;This is an action packed movie.
216;This is a must see movie that keeps you the edge of your seat.
217;I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.
218;A seriously great movie, and also where Joseph Gordon.
219;johnson's approach seems innovative to the casual film.
220;viewer: replace mature actors with teenagers but maintain the overall spirit of the film.
221;The only difference is that Kumble (also a relatively young director at the time) created a fairly complex work.
222;The lives of these young people were genuinely engaging (no matter the viewer's age).
223;I find it revealing that Johnson would create a work with an adolescent target.
224;(This is common to many films within the genre though).
225;sniffers was as genuine as the photo of a hamburger on a fast food menu.
226;Sure this film is full of implausibilities and self.
227;cool stuff, mainly in the form of the central character who is kind of like the unlikely Nerd.
228;dracula resembling dope dealer is hilarious, as is his pumped up bodyguard.
229;camp a la David Lynch's old work, would be a good description of much of this film.
230;style film noir narrative techniques and place them in a contemporary high school setting, but first.
231;the movie's timeline jumps back and forth from the moment Brendan discovers Emily's dead body at the entrance of a concrete waterway tunnel.
232;Meagan Good also makes quite an impression as Kara whether looking like a Cabaret.
233;kilter cinematography, a major plus in adding to the moody atmosphere.
234;The plot twists can be clever but without true emotional resonance, and the various elements have not been connected in the most dramatically effective manner.
235;Wow, what a thrill to see a movie that delights in the visual and doesn't let the images just lie flat on the screen.
236;This movie is not an homage to noir, it IS pure, unrepentant noir.
237;The twisting dialogue, the complex plot, the gorgeous photography, the femme fatale with the flower in her hair, the amoral vixen, the gang war and even the clueless mother of the vicious gangster are all here .
238;joseph Gordon Levitt is the best thing about this movie.
239;He's completely believable as a high school gumshoe out to solve the murder of the dame.
240;The rest of the cast does a great job, notably Meagan Good as the girl who is Bad News and Lukas Haas as the Pin.
241;great movie that was all but ignored in its original run (did it even play theaters?)
242;i read about this in a Leonard Maltin book, it was pretty cool.
243;it was funny how tough this high school was :.
244;Heel it now, dig?BRENDAN .
245;I got all five senses and I slept last night.
246;If by reading these examples, you get a feel for how awkward the dialogue is, imagine hearing this dialogue from actors who don't seem to understand the dialogue either.
247;And I'm someone who loves a good mystery.
248;The writing is excellent, and for all that there's plenty of California sunshine, there's plenty of dark, brooding atmosphere.
249;Also consider the soundtrack as a great exercise in minimalist and modern music.
250;Great casting and excellent filming.
251;i was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.
252;I had really high hopes for this movie.
253;I love deep thinking suspense movies.
254;I had very high hopes for this film.
255;The best movie I've ever seen, claimed some.
256;The film gives teenage life the drama they THINK it had all along.
257;kids will love this film.
258;In about five years, they will probably be ashamed to admit it.
259;That's what growing up is REALLY all about.
260;This movie has really beautiful shots and I love the story!
261;But the cast was superb, and merit five.
262;I loved this film, perhaps a little too much.
263;The writing is incredibly tight and smarty pants.
264;The characters are detailed, vivid, and lovable.
265;Rian Johnson did good by this one, and it took him almost a decade to get this film made for $500k on 35mm.
266;It blew up at Sundance in 2005 winning the special jury prize for originality of vision.
267;At first, I enjoyed the hard.
268;This is a classic film noir with a twist.
269;It has all of the elements of a film noir.
270;And here is the twist: all the characters are in high school.
271;i think the reason this film works is that it takes itself so seriously.
272;The characters talk like they are in a film noir.
273;But that's precisely why it works.
274;It creates a whole new world that you have never seen and it doesn't back down for a second in presenting this world to you in all its gritty detail.
275;this film works and yet it knows that you are suspending a lot of disbelief and throws in a couple scenes to let you know that it is ok to laugh if you want to.
276;There is a great scene where the private eye and the pin meet at the dining room table of the pin's house and his mother serves them lemonade.
277;the actors are all top notch.
278;The camera work is great.
279;The plot is twisty and unpredictable.
280;Overall this was a very engaging and fun cinematic experience.
281;side note: If you are a fan of Film Noir see if you can pick up two direct references to The Maltese Falcon
282;Each frame is carefully orchestrated and composed to perfection.
283;The dialogue is metered and spoken with a contemporary Shakespearean beat.
284;Writer/Director Rian Johnson has created poetry with his first feature length film.
285;hard and piercing, yet on the verge of tears.
286;He stays low, nose clean, until an old love brings him into her world as it's spiraling out of control.
287;Johnson has flipped the genre on its head to brilliant effect.
288;Brendan, our medium into the story, is played to perfection by Joseph Gordon.
289;teacher conference, are delivered with straight faces and a piercing confidence.
290;The wit is there and you will laugh to the seeming absurdity, but the weight of the story holds strong.
291;placed humor helps you realize the gravity of everything even more.
292;levitt shines in the role and proves to be the best up.
293;perfect turns as a violent teen in the wonderful Manic and as a teenage hustler, vagrant in Gregg Araki's disturbing yet unforgettable Mysterious Skin, Levitt is making bold choices and continues a great run with Brick.
294;Also, the accompanying score of piano and brass jazz fits perfectly to the atmosphere, especially on a late scene close.
295;Brick is a stylish modern day noir which uniquely uses high school students as its main stars (although students aren't exactly going to class that much).
296;They keep the mood of a hard.
297;i. e. I've got knives in my eyes.
298;i really liked the effort that Brick makes to be a fresh take on the noir film, but over all, it was just so.
299;Brick is a daring piece of crime cinema that revolves around a certain subculture at a high school.
300;Beyond the school grounds, much of the story transpires in and around a few houses.
301;All in all, I enjoyed the movie.
302;while it might be hard to apply accept the premise, accept the bit to this film, its far.
303;on and cast of characters were nevertheless a joy to experience.
304;Brick is a refreshing entry into the murder.
305;It is stylish, very dark, and even funny sometimes.
306;Watching all the young actors playing noir archetypes talking the talk and walking the walk was amusing.
307;I liked a lot Joseph Gordon.
308;up Lucas Haas stars as a powerful drug lord who still lives with his mom.
309;not so sure but it was fun to watch.
310;Brick is very much a genre piece.
311;If you have a open mind, or at least realize what you're getting in to, you will discover a creative spin on a stagnant genre, some excellent performances (particularly Joseph Gordon.
312;levitt), and one of the best films in recent years.
313;this is a very well made movie.
314;a film noir mystery set at a modern day highschool.
315;the acting is excellent, the cinematography is great.
316;what i particularly loved was the banter.
317;levitt gives a great performance, playing the resourceful highschool rebel.
318;i would recommend this film to almost anyone, especially someone who appreciates film as an artform.
319;What more can you say than that this is the best, most masterfully executed translation of the classic noir genre into any other period?The script is breathtakingly smooth in its fully and unapologetically stylized manner.
320;The characters play their characters gorgeously, and the few moments where the noir facade is broken to point out that these are, theoretically, teenagers (when the mob boss' mother serves the protagonist a glass of milk before they get down to talking the business of drugs, crime, and espionage) work wonderfully to complement the mood.
321;It is completely and utterly stylized.
322;A classic I'm sure I'll re.
323;watch countless times as I make sure all my best friends have seen it.
324;this is a good movie other then the fact that there all in high schoolthis is way too much drama for high school, but thats what makes this movie funny.
325;This is a great film, very entertaining.
326;Any fan of film noir will get a kick out of this mixture of Dawson's Creek and The Big Sleep.
327;brick is one amazing film due to its heavy use of tough.
328;you laugh at the funny parts and are on the edge of your seat at the tense parts.
329;i give high praise to the director and the cast of Brick.
330;This film has a nonchalant style of its own, it has a pretty good plot setting start and from then on, I was utterly bamboozled and I don't even use the word.
331;The best thing about this confusing ride was the end.
332;For whatever strange reason, the artificiality of the dialogue and farcical nature of the proceedings works quite well once you give in to the conceit.
333;detective style and there are all the usual archetypes and manipulations.
334;Somehow they seem sort of fresh in the setting of high school.
335;And since most of us tended to discover detective novels in our teen years, it seems perfectly fitting to project their tropes out into that world, to imagine that high school is a microcosm of all the things one read about in pulp fiction.
336;so I'll take sides with the pro.
337;brick crowd
338;The characters were well written and acted.
339;Completely enjoyable and nice ending.
340;The acting was superb, the story was awesome and engaging, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen the entire time, and it is filmed and directed with care, which is rare in films these days.
341;While the film was obviously influenced by class Film Noir genre movies, Cache, Veronica Mars, and, yes, many mafia films, Brick is clearly an original piece, which is a great change from all of these Bread and Circus films that are plaguing mainstream cinemas as we speak.
342;cutter flashy trash that most young directors seem to grasp hold of, is truly refreshing and amazing to behold.
343;The plot itself is a bit of Hammett's Red Harvest (possibly his greatest work) and Chandler's The Big Sleep.
344;It's tense, a little convoluted, but breathtaking to behold.
345;The performances are all spot.
346;And being aware, you're already in on it and you take the ride and enjoy every minute of it.
347;Brick is a very ambitious attempt at hybrid yet derivitive indy type film making.
348;Such attempts can yield incredible results as in Slingblade, Pulp Fiction or Blair Witch Project.
349;It's a fairly original concept.
350;I'll even allow that the right treatment of Brick very well could have worked to some degree.
351;There is a machine gun cadence to the dialogue delivery that, at times is unintentionally funny.
352;It's a good thing people in the real world don't talk the way noir characters do.
353;I appreciate this aspect of the noir genre and have enjoyed it when done well in classic noir films.
354;His adversary (aside from the entire world) is a highly intelligent yet amoral and calculating crime boss with a gaggle of lesser minded goons in tow.
355;I am confident when I say that my divulging of these details does not in anyway constitute a spoiler.
356;the noir genre by definition is hinged upon extreme melodrama, quirky and intense dialogue and extreme machismo.
357;When depicted with a backdrop of plausible characters the formula can work very well.
358;The director and writer aimed high and should be commended for that.
359;This movie is just great, the characters are very intense and the story is a real pleasure for all thrillers and film noir aficionados.
360;It's an intriguing murder mystery with false turns, and an ending that, while you were kind of expecting it, was beautifully done.
361;The film is appropriately sparse given that the main character is a teenage boy, and shot wonderfully.
362;This movie was surprisingly good.
363;It's the type of film that you'd catch on cable.
364;The movie brings to life a genre which has all but disappeared from mainstream cinema, but also brings a refreshing feeling of originality through its use of unconventional characters.
365;Joseph G. leavitt was great in this film he has taken a lot of risks in the roles he plays .
366;Snappy dialogue, delivered at a rapid fire pace and flowery turn of phrases that you have to pay attention to decipher.
367;As a 1940's noir type film, it has the standard archetypes: the hero who is seeking justice, his brainy sidekick, the femme fatale, the gal with the heart of gold, the larger than life villain (played by Lukas Haas) and his dunderhead henchman.
368;At first, hearing these young.
369;this film is daring, brutal and at times actually fun.
370;What it turned out to be was wonderful neo.
371;It was as terse and well.
372;acted as anything of this genre that I've seen .
373;with several delightful twists I didn't see coming.
374;talking to him like he was a kid (which he was) while he is having a meeting with The Pin at the kitchen table .
375;the juxtaposition is hilarious, clever, and a needed moment of comic relief.
376;This movie is great because it can be watched repeatedly, and each time the viewer will learn something new!
377;It has an excellent dark mood, and it is fascinating how the filmmakers updated the film noir genre to a modern day high school.
378;I loved the way the characters talked in this film.
379;I recommend watching this movie once without subtitles to focus on the action and once with subtitles to uncover all the secret, twisting dialogue.
380;This movie will leave you with a lot to ponder for a week or two!
381;The movie has a great pace and a really interesting feel.
382;levitt, who has blossomed as an actor siince his time on 3rd Rock, did a spectacular job of taking the audience through the dark world of drugs and super hip and smart players as he tries to find a killer.
383;the dialogue takes a few minutes to adjust to but once you start emersing yourself into what the director has created you become part of it.
384;Because it is an alternate world.
385;But it was a lot of fun to visit.
386;Johnson's screenplay is consistent, superbly delivered and adds immeasurably to the uniquely strange atmosphere of BRICK, as we are eased into something more abstract than the ususal mainstream screenplays written for people who want to be spoon.
387;speak in that classic book/movie and no complaints worth a moment's notice.
388;G. vanSant's MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO with Shakespeare to boot, hailed as a masterpiece .
389;A clever concept: film noir in a contemporary L. a setting.
390;A for effort, less so for execution but definitely worth seeing.
391;Best film noir in years.
392;sharp tense story with a fantastic cast and beautiful locations and great music.
393;levitts best film and a triumph for writer/director Rian Johnson
394;boiled noir movies of the forties, and a cast of high.
395;mystery set at a Los Angeles high school is pure movie fancy.
396;But what a clever, fascinating ruse he's devised.
397;the plot itself is a mind twister worthy of Kiss Me Deadly.
398;And the acting, like the dialogue, is utterly sincere, even at its most outrageously hip.
399;Great support from Haas, Noah Fleiss, and Norah Zehetner give this Brick extra heft.
400;Good writing and good acting can't revive it.
401;I think you have to take teenagers a lot more seriously than I do in order to enjoy this movie.
402;This is a movie that I have been watching over and over again, everything about it is great.
403;noir, detective movie that is incredibly elabortate, surreal, and filled with really good.30s like dialogue.
404;The story jumps back two days and we see this same girls hand slip a note inside a locker.
405;The locker belongs to Brendan of course and the note gives him direction to go to a certain payphone and wait.
406;but it's a lot more elaborate than that.
407;Making a whodunit movie nowadays is hard
408;What happens as Brendan tries to figure out what's going on is actually really entertaining to.
409;This movie is very elaborate, so pay close attention to it.
410;If you like suspense, and mystery this is your movie.
411;The dialogue is hard to follow if you aren't familiar with the slang, but the cinematography, sound and music, coupled with some of the best indie acting I've ever seen, make for an experience that will change the way you look at movies.
412;Which was great in my oppinion.
413;don't see any Oscars here, but an entertaining and fulfilling flick for a Saturday afternoon .
414;when I first saw previews for this film I was entranced, the camera shots, style, jargon, and characters were spot on.
415;I don't quite know how to describe the genuis of the film, but it takes a somewhat novel if not seemingly misguided idea and twists it into one of the greatest Noir detective stories I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.
416;I had a lot of fun also picking up dialogue tidbits from other films.
417;There are at least a dozen more.
418;This is just as much about the love of cinema in general as it is an homage to one genre in particular.
419;This is a review of the well.
420;Smart acting and mental fencing.3.
421;smart dialogue and tension games.
422;It is one of my favorite modern films.
423;If you can transpose yourself into the realm presented, you will love it.
424;I'd also recommend The Big Sleep for those who haven't seen it (original with Bogart and Bacall).
425;cover edition has some excellent production commentary including expanded and deleted scenes, which was surprisingly good viewing.
426;(It can be viewed here on Amazon.
427;The online transfer is good with a clear and intelligible soundtrack .
428;The deleted scenes are good, and the two screen tests are ok.
429;The term is also sometimes used to describe a person who is very easily controlled, such as a yes man.
430;In the case of Brick both definitions are cleverly combined.
431;A ride in a car (as in pick.
432;To wield (as with a weapon)
433;An ace is the highest playing card, meaning 'high.
434;When Brendan strips Kara and says I'm showing your ace, he is saying that Kara's most valuable asset is her beauty, which she uses to manipulate people with (e. g. lap dogs, Dode, etc).
435;The deleted scenes are great, and the introductions are pretty good
436;Although this movie is one of the best films I've ever seen, and an auspicious debut akin again to Kevin Smith's Clerks.
437;This film begs for a good special edition.
438;The language, the dramatic flair, the perfect perversion of noir.
439;I do, however, feel compelled to offer a few thoughts.
440;i recommend the film with absolutely no hesitation.
441;The script is smart and engaging, the actors appealing and the conceit of staging a classic noir in a modern, brightly.
442;lit high school actually works.
443;it is absolutely the movie it wants to be, with no apology.
444;And trust me, I certainly know a couple of people who simply didn't get it.
445;as a lover of film, however, I love filmmakers that show a real knowledge and appreciation of the genres they work in.
446;I thought this was a decent movie.
447;I laughed out loud at the scene in the vice principals office, as if a vice principal and a student would actually act the way they did.
448;She dropped him when she started hanging out with the popular kids, and now she's missing.
449;They speak in a teen/drug code that is so unique I actually had to turn on the subtitles to understand it.
450;Once I figured out what the slang meant, it was a fascinating new language.
451;levitt has matured a lot since he was in3rd Rock From the Sun.
452;He carries the movie with his James Dean.
453;Lukas Haas gives a subtle, eerie performance as a club.
454;This is a moody, intense, and unflinching look at the teen drug world (and it's interesting that there are no curse words, no drugs are mentioned by name, and no drugs are taken on camera.)
455;the best movie i've seen all year, and probably the best i'll see all year.
456;It's just really interesting how the dialogue is throughout the film.
457;levitt plays Brendan, who is a high.
458;the dialogues throughout is just what made the film interesting.
459;Plus, the suspense factor helped.
460;The background music was wonderful and surely helped the buildup of suspense.
461;I'm sure some will find this movie interesting.
462;But that weird little experiment was not half bad and Brick is a lot more successful in trying to pull this off and is a lot closer to Sin City than to Bugsy Malone.
463;Brick won the Sundance Film Festival's Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision, and you have to grant writer.
464;The other half is listening to what these characters have to say, because the rhythms are Hammet's, but the glossary is often idiosyncratic and the dynamic is pure high school (My favorite is when Brendan is engaged in a conversation that has descended down to both parties saying Yeah a lot and he finally shoots back, There's a thesaurus in the library.
465;while for the most part this movie takes place in a Charlie Brown world where adults are absent, there are a few notable exceptions.
466;The illusion of this strange reality is maintained from start to finish, when Brendan confronts the guilty party in the middle of a high school football field.
467;At that point Johnson most clearly invites comparisons to The Maltese Falcon because at this point he knows that you have either bought the game plan here and will enjoy the more overt homage, or this would be the final nail in the coffin.
468;For me the results are certainly enough to warrant rounding up on this 2005 film and to hope that Johnson can find something equally creative for his next venture.
469;This movie is gripping and intelligent.
470;Joseph Gordon Levitt is amazing and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery.
471;Brick is an edgy, roughly cut film, shot on a shoestring.
472;Johnson's screenplay won awards from Central Ohio Film Critics Association and San Francisco Film Critics Circle.
473;Johnson was nominated as a promising director by the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and by the Sitges.
474;The film won a special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.
475;joseph Gordon Levitt was excellent in bothStop.
476;For those of us who laughed hard at TV's Third Rock from the Sun, it's wonderful to see his growth as an actor, perhaps poised to become a major star with the right film.
477;As Brendan, he carried his love on his sleeve as he seeks to find out the truth behind his girlfriend's murder.
478;She goes with a football star to enhance her status.
479;As Rian Johnson creates the role, we are always interested to see what face will next emerge.
480;It is a very interesting performance and treatment of the character.
481;noah Fleiss turns in an excellent performance as Tugger.
482;As Dode, Segun brings a childlike charm to a goth exterior.
483;His banter with Brendan is as bouncy as ping.
484;Meagan Good has nice moments as Kara, a stage chanteuse who enjoys Asian makeup.
485;in the beginning of the film, I found the fast.
486;As the film unwinds, we acclimate to a hip lingo that is often a cool shorthand that provides the missing pieces of the puzzle.
487;For example, he talks about having to re.
488;I enjoyed the film, appreciating how Johnson gives free reign to his supporting characters to shine.
489;This is worth an evening's entertainment.
490;This unique mixture of contemporary teen.
491;angst and classic noir sensibility is priceless and wonderful.
492;All the young actors rise to the occasion beautifully .
493;and it all works beautifully and with occasional well.
494;they're all there and entirely compelling.
495;It's a surreal and haunting work of art: the lighting, the faces, the music, editing, the Hammett.
496;Renews my believe in film as Art.
497;See it once, see it twice.
498;This will happen again, with BRICK.
499;In fact, Brick stayed in the top ten in the UK for weeks this spring/summer.
500;I suppose, given the concept and direction, they all do a pretty good job.
501;levitt does a fine impression of a teen.
502;In a way, the super.
503;While most teens in real life are a balance between cool and self.
504;conscious awkwardness, in Brick everyone exhibits flawless film version sang.
505;I heard about this movie from a friend who RAVED up and down about how deep, hardcore, and heart wrenching this film was.
506;I had seen the preview and was quite intrigued, this looked fresh and unique!Sadly, this film tried way too hard to be all the things my friend said it was.
507;I feel that the only people who will really enjoy this movie are indie high school kids who think very highly of their intellect.
508;levitt gets better all the time.
509;This was an interesting take on a murder investigation by high school student.
510;The hard boiled detective angle was excellent.
511;Brick is a fantastic detective story full of twists and turns and will keep you entertained the whole time.
512;levitt is phenomenal and amazing to watch.
513;Rian Johnson is a great director and writer.
514;Brick is like old film noir with a new twist.
515;With some great performances (including a slyer than ever Joseph Gordon Levitt) and slickly witty slang dialogue, Johnson takes a seemingly simple premise and adds some innovative flavor to create a deadly original yarn.
516;featuring crisp dialogue, atmospheric cinematography, organicly sparse music, and a downright cool style, Brick is a force to be reckoned with, and a refreshingly original take on the neo.
517;Focus Features has a way with making all of their products very well.
518;I think it provides a good look into the underworld that exists in many middle class American high schools.
519;However if you grew up in a high school with drug prevalence it will really resonate with you.
520;I felt that I could really relate to the movie.
521;The main character brilliantly brings down everyone who was involved in his ex.
522;The best revenge I've ever seen in a movie.
523;Ok, I really wanted to like this movie because I saw the previews on another movie and it looked very interesting.
524;The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars was for the acting which was very good.
525;I think such critics are engaging in a subtle hypocrisy.
526;Thus even the literalists among us can enjoy the classics of film noir.
527;Mr. Johnson is challenging us to enjoy it despite its absurdity, and indeed, to enjoy it because it is absurd.
528;It is both at the same time
529;But it is also subversive because it is poking fun at the audience and our expectations.
530;This movie has a dark tone to it.
531;The characters, especially the main character, Brendan, and his friend and confidant, Brain, use a very strange slang to communicate.
532;There grows a feeling of urgency in Brendan's situation, although we're not exactly sure what that is just yet.
533;it must be something important.
534;It was somewhat suspenseful and interesting enough to keep me watching.
535;The characters are also fairly interesting, even if only in their mysteriousness.
536;this is a pretty good flick.
537;I enjoyed the plot and how it all played out.
538;The female lead is intoxicating, however.
539;If you like either, though, you're in for a real treat.
540;Hammett would be proud, especially since some of the slang is encased in some truly witty dialogue.You have to like this sort of thing, of course, but if you do, it's surprisingly well.
541;highly recommended for fans of this sort of thing.
542;This is an interesting film, it tells the story of a college kid investigating the death of his ex.
543;What makes it stand out is that the film is presented in the style of film noir, with the teenager in the role of a gumshoe detective.
544;It's a nice idea and follows a similar plot to the investigations with a few twists and turns along the way.
545;everyone does a good job in their roles, in particular the lead.
546;Without the style gimmick it's a solid enough film, everyone plays their part and the story unfolds at a decent pace.
547;The style does set it apart, but also proves it undoing.
548;It's well filmed which does set it up a step higher than that, but still the impression remains.
549;While it does present an interesting juxtaposition it did hamper my enjoyment somewhat.
550;that leaves it as a film that's a bit tricky to rate, it's a decent enough film, but not as entertaining as it might have been.
551;Still it's not a bad watch by any means and it does stand apart from many other teen movies, so worth checking out.
552;it works like this:Think of a well used phrase (e. g.
553;Well, at least that has the Ramones in it!
554;Now That's some good writing!
555;levitt (so very good in Mysterious Skin) as a teenage Sam Spade with strong overtones of Dirty Harry and equally strong low tones of Holden Caulfield.
556;first time director Rian Johnson exhibits a strong sense of style and an amazing finesse with his young cast: they all come off as caring, thoughtful, emotionally stable or not human beings.
557;levitt's Brendan are refreshing, daring and astringent creations and as such are not to be missed by anyone interested in contemporary American movies.
558;I have to say it, Brick is probably the best movie I have seen this year so far, and I don't think I'll see another that will top it.
559;if you're unfamiliar with the approach to the movie, it's pretty much a detective.
560;whodunit movie with a catch
561;this film is extremely well done and well made, and that caught me off guard.
562;The film seems innocent and fun at a glance until you really get into it, and then you realize how dark and brutal it can get.
563;It's film noir at its finest, and it even pokes fun at itself a little here and there, but overall it's a pretty dark and serious movie.
564;What really sells the movie in the end is the great performances from the cast, especially the lead actor.
565;It stands out, and that's something that has to be admired to some degree.
566;Also, I recommend that you see it more than once.
567;As much as I liked it the first time, I really appreciated it for what it was more during the second viewing.
568;Brick took me for a ride and I have to say that I loved every minute of it.
569;It's an exhilarating and brilliant film that takes a lot of chances without apologizing to anybody in the end.
570;It's one you'll either love or hate, but I think it's definitely worth the time checking it out.
571;If you're looking for something that isn't typical or dull, then I highly recommend it.
572;It's high up on my list of favorite movies now, and that only took two days.
573;There is the cultist's favorite noir, the gritty suburban life of today, and the impasse teen flick that for some reason is stunningly original on a level not seen before.
574;the story, while complex in form, is at the core a simple mystery.
575;Levitt not only steals the film, but nails the character right smack into the skull.
576;heroes this century has seen thus far.
577;There is a mood to this film that is neither claustrophobic nor horrifying yet glides dangerously around those lines at all times.
578;inarguably one of the most exciting and refreshing pictures since 2004's experimental Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
579;Director Rian Johnson much like Michael Gondry paints a modern classic that is sure to have people spinning in and out of their seats.
580;it is a relief to have a breath of fresh air in an industry so heavily polluted with either the same thing or something less spectacular.
581;Rian Johnson's Brick won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Festival for originality of vision, and seldom has an award been more deserved.
582;This witty, breathlessly entertaining low.
583;The surprise is that director/screenwriter Johnson plays the story absolutely straight, and gets away with it, while at the same time touching on some uncomfortable truths about growing up in America.
584;levitt), whose delicate, poetic looks belie his limitless resources of toughness and courage, goes underground among his school's drug.
585;Brick is remarkably stylish and atmospheric for its miniscule budget
586;There are scenes of action and suspense here that put big.
587;levitt is quickly becoming one of the truly great American screen actors.
588;You'll probably need to see the film more than once to catch all the details, but, then again, you'll WANT to see it more than once.
589;what I like best is, despite the small budget, Brick is great to look at.
590;out California background, nice interior sets.
591;It has more twists and turns than Nascar and the best part is you don't need headphones!
592;This movie offers a fresh insight into the hierarchy of people.
593;I gave it 3 stars for the good acting.
594;It's smart and creative with a dark sense of humor .
595;a rarity at the box office these days.
596;The whole thing is a great twist on the classic film noir detective genre.
597;Once you accept that the premise is kind of a wink.
598;wink to the audience (obviously it's unrealistic but that's the point) you'll definitely enjoy the ride.
599;i found the movie very interesting and even riveting at times.
600;levitt is a terrific talent and has a very bright future.
601;I love documentary films because they deal in reality, and credibility ranks high upon my requirements for a good 'fiction' movie, at least a good crime or drama.
602;Give it a chance
603;schoolers being this sophisticated, or devious, but if you suspend your sense of credibility and let the story take you along, you might enjoy it.
604;It's an interesting premise, reminding me of River's Edge and Blue Velvet at the same time.
605;But the path from Point A to Point B is a twisted one full of quick dialogue and beautiful camera shots.
606;The way the movie bounces around and has several interesting characters reminds me of a Tarantino movie.
607;It's a strong film with a hardly.
608;All of the performances are solid and not put aside by a big.
609;and independent feel), a Tarantino movie (for its unique characters) and L. a. Confidential (for its crime and plot.)
610;I had seen a preview or two of this movie and was interested immediately, but it was only when I saw this movie listed somewhere as one of the top 20 high school movies of all time, in the same category as such classic as Heathers and Ferris Beuller, that I was now fully intrigued.
611;and to boot, this film also has the edge of making the world of this high school the setting of film noir.
612;With an informant named Brain, a classic geek who even works on a Rubrics Cube, Brendan delves into the world of the jocks, the beautiful people, and the burn.
613;There is, of course, a beautiful but possibly treacherous femme fatale, a Tolkein.
614;A bit of a score card is needed to keep track of some things, but a lot of this works out in fascinating ways, the plots within plots within plots led on by this tough plain.
615;A throwback to detective noir flicks from the 30's and 40's set in a high school, this excellent movie keeps viewers glued with snappy dialogue and a sturdy plot.
616;levitt is wonderful as the outcast protagonist , walking a fine line between brooding and witty as he investigates his ex.
617;I don't want to give anything away about this movie, it is one of those movies where the less you know, the more fun the ride is.
618;The writing is brilliant, the characters are interesting and compelling.
619;The style is reminiscent of the best film noire has to offer, while having a fresh, edgy style.
620;Before reading any other reviews that give away too much and ruin it, just watch this movie and enjoy.
621;One of my top favorite and now I have it in my hot lil hands!
622;The Bottom Line:All of Brick's pieces may not fit together when the story is done, but the movie is a fascinating attempt to fit a noir detective story into a High School and far more interesting than most teen movies: give it a shot.
623;It felt like a school play and people reciting their lines.
624;After she hangs up Brendan tracks her down and she tells him that she is fine and there aren't any problems.
625;The next day Brendan finds her dead and charges himself with the task of finding her killer.
626;the good: I was pretty hyped about this movie after viewing the trailer.
627;It looked cool and edgy.
628;The film noir concept for this movie was a good idea and I thought the concept of the movie was good.
629;It was a great idea with just so so execution.
630;This movie has the feel of a Raymond Chandler novel brought to the big screen.
631;Think about the The Long Goodbye with Elliott Gould, then turn the protagonists into high.
632;i enjoyed this movie immensely.
633;There are many scenes in which you just have to absorb the mood and the feel of the atmosphere, or the expression on the actor's face .
634;There are a lot of nods to old.
635;levitt made a good showing in the excellent 'Mysterious Skin' and he proves reasonably watchable here.
636;perfect hardboiled detective story straight out of the tradition of Dashiell Hammett.
637;I thought it was a very clever and entertaining piece of work.
638;What the creative team did was take a story that has essentially become clich in modern cinema and breathed new life into it.
639;What was unique to Brick was the high.
640;So get over it and enjoy the movie.
641;adult existence was well done and ultimately made the movie fun to watch.
642;This movie bricked in a big way.
643;This movie was a good attempt to be 'art'.
644;I saw this movie twice in the movie theater and I have already pre.
645;Crime Novels of the 1930's and 1940's), and it is easy to see how noir fiction became such a rich source of creative movie.
646;Brick is the latest in a series of great (Chinatown, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet) and very good movies (L. a. Confidential, Heist, The Grifters, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) that use the trappings of noir literature and earlier noir films.
647;The speech of the characters works because the teenagers are still kids, despite the serious themes and deadly consequences.
648;It's not so much a joke, as in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, that the main character gets himself beat up, but the humor comes from a tense confrontation between gumshoes and kingpin being interrupted by the kingpin's mom serving orange juice.
649;Much of the surreal where I eat lunch type of dialogue can be seen as a device to show how a lot of teens turn to dope and dope.
650;levitt's character and the school principal, played by the great Richard Roundtree.
651;the acting in this film is top.
652;notch and a great pleasure to see.
653;Compare this to another earnest film about high school, Elephant, and it's easy to see how professional actors and the elimination of background clutter makes for a better presentation.
654;It's also nice to see that Brick has a healthy number of passionate defenders on the Amazon page.
655;My only wish is that I could see it again for the first time.
656;I read great reviews about this film so I took it out from the library.
657;I was immediately drawn into it, mostly by the presence of the lead, Joseph Gordon.
658;levitt, a very appealing young actor.
659;well, I know it was Los Angeles, but still.
660;Charming and cute as he is, he didn't seem street.
661;smart and tough as I guess he was supposed to be.
662;(It's amazing that his glasses survived through all of the physical abuse he took.)
663;It is shot in sunny southern California, in brilliant color.
664;I did turn the subtitles on and it helped.
665;Anyway the acting is very good.
666;The transfer is wonderful, the film looks great and the sound is up to par.
667;One of the students there is a loner, with a best friend he meets in secluded places.
668;He name is Emily, she is pretty and elusive.
669;It is interesting to find out how lonely, socially excluded kid can find his way into a popular crowd and make sure they know he is determined to find out what happened.
670;movie goes back and forth between the events and dialog is smart and heartbreaking lots of times.
671;Definitely wait until the end, because that is when the entire story culminates.
672;Brick has to be Joseph's best performance ever on the big screen.
673;The witty dialogue and plot of this movie will make it a cult classic for years to come.
674;I would recommend Brick to film buffs who enjoy exploring independent art house films and unusual genres.
675;This is a fair movie.
676;The story is actually quite good, but there's a lot missing.
677;It has pretty good acting, but kids wouldn't really do this by themselves.
678;Her new status as a member of the recently.
679;He's the quirkiest of a quirky bunch, a drug kingpin (hence the nickname) who lives and works in his mother's basement, has a right.
680;And yet, somehow, Haas carries the role with an amazing amount of menace.
681;Go along for the ride, 'cause it's a good one.
682;Brick seems to be more than just a good movie.
683;Each of the components works and dazzles .
684;but all in the service of the whole.
685;I have watched this film several times simply to savor the competence and skill of the storytelling, neck.
686;neck with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang as the best.
687;innovation and outstanding dialogue, it's the tone and mood and story that pulls you in and pays off.
688;The amazing fact is, Brick's novelty genre.
689;imposed handicap and disadvantage which the movie easily transcends and redeems.
690;i loved the balls of this movie.
691;I loved the visuals, the dialogue, the plot, the pacing, everything.
692;But especially I loved the intelligence .
693;and the respect that the director/writer has for the audience.
694;Brick is well written film noir, with an excellent performance by Joseph Gordon.
695;The use of color in this genre was interesting and served the high school contemporary setting well.
696;The femme fatale was well written and overall, it was an enjoyable film.
697;who, in Mysterious Skin, delivered one of the best film performances of 2005 .
698;guy status conferred on them
699;This movie is incredibly original.
700;Rian Johnson is one of the greatest up and coming directors and his debut feature film tells us why.
701;JGL delivers a fantastic performance with some of the best dialogue in recent memory.
702;The cast is just incredible and the director is a awesome.
703;this movie is on the top of my charts.
704;an admirable attempt at updating the famous film noir genre, Brick is both entertaining and innovative (as much as a film can be that mimicks an older genre).
705;It is highly stylized and mapped out.
706;The main character is outstanding.
707;His acting is daring and had me yelling at the screen at least twice.
708;To say the least, I got emotionally involved in his circumstances.
709;see, so that I could watch it again for the first time.
710;I loved the characters, they seemed so complete.
711;The cherry on top of the cake was that the girl who played an important part throughout the movie was drop dead gorgeous.
712;Smart, cool and entertaining .
713;I watched it twice in a row, it impressed me so much.
714;The witty dialogue and believable performances actually made me have to keep reminding myself that these characters were high school students and not cynical thirty.
715;This is a great Sundance film.
716;As the mystery unravels it creates an emotional connection between you and the main character as he embarks on the tortuous task of unveiling who killed his x. girlfriend.
717;This film is good enough to keep your attention throughout and offers a twist in the end.
718;I caught this movie late at night and stayed up until 2 to finish it.
719;levitt and the kinetic pacing.
720;It reminded me a bit of River's Edge, another film that pulls you into its web.
721;levitt, his love for a girl that is unrequinted, the mystery surrounding her, and Gordon.
722;Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.
723;I thought my highschool experience was action packed.
724;levitt, and this film was great.
725;Creepy, funny, and amazingly well done.
726;dollar actors, special effects, and elaborate sets to create a compelling story?
727;The utter brilliance of this film makes it difficult to even write about it, and every time I watch it I'm more intrigued with the characters.
728;levitt really carries the film with his character Brenden's fearless quick.
729;wit and carefully crafted lines.
730;The whole cast, however, works together so well and the chemistry is as such that the exchange is so quick you really have to pay attention to catch all the wit.
731;Johnson created this tale in the tradition of classic hard boiled detective stories the likes of The Maltese Falcon (even quoting this film), but placing the events in a suburban Southern Californian high school, giving this a unique modern edge.
732;I don't really know if I can write anymore about Brick, you'll just have to discover this gem yourself.
733;Since I already used that title for a review, I didn't use it again for this review of Brick, but rest assured it fits.
734;old, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, Brick is easy to enjoy.
735;Brick is certainly worth checking out just to find out what the fuss is all about
736;This is an intense movie.
737;I like the fact that keeps you in suspense.
738;levitt gives a great performance.
739;BRICK is a noir story the likes of The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon .
740;lady love completely enthralled me.
741;The twists on the old form are interesting.
742;The movie seethes with a smart energy and the dialogue sizzles.
743;and even after you watch the first time, and the mystery is solved, Brandon's journey is so intense and swirling that it's great to watch over and over again.
744;the soundtrack and cinematography complete the package to make a slick movie that is both fun and dark.
745;my favorite scene is the one that (for me) best encapsulates the film's tone: Brandon gets pulled into the vice principal's office, where he is asked to rat out potential dealers on school property.
746;He then shouts that if the VP has a discipline issue with him write me up or suspend me!
747;this film is an original and interesting tale with beautiful camera work and excellent performances.
748;ish, 50's detective novel type tone abounds and is almost poetic throughout (I highly reccomend watching this with subtitles to fully appreciate the language).
749;The acting and directing and overall plot and character development are top notch as well.
750;A lot of people my have come here because they've heard about this movie and haven't yet seen it.
751;Seeing 1940's film noir, soaked in a teen centered tale of woe, works better than I would've ever thought.
752;rian Johnson makes a writing and directorial debut to rival most of his peers and mentors.
753;This film is enough to make the Gods tremble, hopefully he'll be able to follow it up appropriately.
754;calculating heroine is also a definite high point, and her career and longevity in films is assured.
755;this film could easily be theBlade Runnerof this generation.
756;Having lived in one of the most populous cities in the U. s., and then living in one of the most isolated, I can only see the universal truth in this film.
757;We face daunting challenges and it's films like this that can make us aware.
758;And even if you haven't, Rian Johnson's Brick, an homage to classic film noirs, is well worth a look.
759;while there's many parallels to Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon (even the item the title refers to is sort of a modern equivalent of the black bird), as well as Raymond Chandler's mysteries and other stories of the genre, Brick has more than enough unique twists and turns of its own.
760;He hides the body so he can bring the people behind her death to justice himself, at the same time making himself a suspect in her murder.
761;several of the classic noir hallmarks are there.
762;gorgeous femme fatales, cheerleader Laura (Nora Zehetner) and drama club member Kara (Meagan Good).
763;nathan Johnson's score is one of the highlights of the film.
764;Like the movie, the score has an Indie feel, a contemporary feel, and a retro feel, all at once, with a hint of jazz.
765;Reoccuring character themes lend dramatic emphasis to the film.
766;out performance is by Nora Zehetner, who is glamorous in the best old.
767;fashioned sense, and could definitely go places.
768;For those not in the know, I love lamp is a quote from another Brick, he of Anchorman fame.
769;A nice idea, if it weren't so knuckle.
770;Anyone?The director was obviously so in love with his outrageous gimmick that he forgot to add even the slightest personality into his characters.
771;A film written by someone with the slightest idea of what teenage kids are actually like would be a start, (one person in the entire school has a mobile phone, for example) but what there DOES need to be is an actual story, with characters that people can relate to or at least care about .
772;Film noir I can deal with.
773;Try The Proposition, and leave this well alone.
774;It's more believable to boot.
775;Film noir has to be one of my favorite genres in the realm of story weaving.
776;The best analogy I have for this film is being on a date with a woman who is beautiful and dripping with sex appeal yet has no depth or substance whatsoever.
777;I do appreciate the ode to classic noir by having our anti.
778;Technically, the framing and cinematography are breathtaking, as is the score.
779;on a positive note, the acting was very good.
780;levitt did a really fine job as our anti.
781;The mood was also very stark and bare, great for a film noir.
782;The lighting and cinematography was also on point.
783;I have a blockbuster movie pass and I watch up to 80.100 movies a year.
784;levitt's performance in Manic, and mysterios skin.
785;I know some people will not agree with me, but I see one of the best character actors in the making.
786;This movie is a little long, but I absolutley loved this movie.
787;But, when she opened it all was well.
788;the film has a number of strengths.
789;We see things as he sees things and realize he's intelligent, perhaps more intelligent than most people realize.
790;Even though it's not a typical high school world, we see the world from a high schooler's psychological perspective.
791;Fortunately the plot is compelling enough to maintain the viewer's interest so we wrestle with the complexities.
792;Still it's an intriguing film and well worth viewing.
793;This movie has a great cast, a seemingly good story, and a ton of eye candy, but even with all that it has going for it.
794;I was really impressed by this film.
795;I am a fan of old detective movies and found this movie to follow the serial perfectly.
796;It is set in a High School, which is a refreshing change from the other attempts to make modern film noirs, all of which take place in seedy places or at night.
797;This film instead relies on dialogue to progress the story and create the mood.
798;If you like mystery or just a clever movie you will like this film as well.
799;High school is such a perfect setting for a film noir, and though it may seem ridiculous at first, there's many parallels between the world of a teenager and a character in a 1940s noir, be it the battle between the police and the shamuses and the battle between the administrators and the students or the shady meetings under bridges and the shady meetings in the parking lot after school.
800;boiled dialogue, delivered at a startling pace by a talented young cast.
801;levitt is truly excellent, and he shows real promise should he be cast in the right roles.
802;Haas and Fleiss both play their roles quite well, but it's Meagan Good as a scheming drama queen (literally) who commands the most attention.
803;In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Gordon.
804;The protagonist loner with a rocky exterior and a noble interior, looking to do the right thing
805;powerful, ominous villain, usually an obsese fifty.year.
806;Much of the film's charm comes from consideration of its many allegories to adult noir tales.
807;Johnson is well aware of this, though.
808;It shows not only in the maturity and seasoned approach of his directing, but also in the stimulating photography and, especially, in the stunning editing.
809;Brick would make an excellent sample film to show young editors, since Johnson .
810;has done such a spectacular job, fashioning a seamless flow of jump cuts, point.
811;view shots, distorted lenses, and exposed film.
812;Supporting this is an inventive, unorthodox score by Nathan Johnson, comprised of some sort of naiive bells and the woeful trumpet which Jerry Goldsmith used in his music for Chinatown and L. a. Confidential.
813;It was unquestionably one of the best films of 2005.
814;I'd even go so far as to call it one of the top films I've ever seen.
815;Viewed as a film from an experienced director, it's a stellar film, but when viewed as Johnson's debut, it's a fantastic achievement.
816;Fortunately, Johnson seems to have received the attention he deserved from this film: his next project stars big.
817;levitt gets some decent roles, because he proves his acting prowess here.
818;It's films with the originality and effort of Brick that keep the industry going, and if you haven't seen it, don't hesitate to leap up and hunt for it like Sam Spade for the maltese falcon.
819;One of the best movies I've seen over the years the language sends me to movies of old, old detective movies!
820;This movie has so many twists that you will need to watch it more than once.
821;The vocabulary of street thugs is impressive.
822;Great movie for teenagers, many lessons to learn here.
823;This movie started off pretty good in the first half building up intrigue and suspense with a girl's murder and making you wonder what happened to her
824;I come into all movies with an open mind and give everyone of them a chance by watching them instead of going by reviews but.
825;levitt is one of my favorite actors.
826;Off beat and a little quirky like most of his movies with off beat quirky characters, it was a movie I liked.
827;It really looked good on it.
828;time director Rian Johnson's experimental, but entertaining crime drama.
829;It takes a while to get accustomed to the rhythm and mood of the film, and lots of slang too, but once you do, you find the film surprisingly engaging with the story of complicated mystery among a web of these eccentric characters.
830;Brick is perhaps a love.
831;Whatever your reaction might be, it is true that Brick is very unique nonetheless.
832;This is one fun movie.
833;I liked it best on my 3rd viewing.
834;It has a very cool and sortof sexy soundtrack that at first reminded me of the the one from Bladerunner, as it was so full of spaces.
835;The filming is nice if somewhat dark at times, but the Noir staging is Very nice.
836;The plot keeps you guessing and thats all I will say about plot because it is so fun.
837;Brick is a great homage to the noirs of the 40s, but with a modern high school setting.
838;levitt is a brilliant actor, and the rest of the cast is spot on too.
839;The script and camera work are awesome
840;The dialogue is interesting because it has sort of a 40s feel to it.
841;A few scenes are very funny, but mostly its a pretty intense drama.
842;Definitely worth seeing for anyone open.
843;After they broke up, Emily started eating lunch with a more popular, yet mysterious crowd (The Upper.
844;As he delves into their world, he finds a sickening subculture of drugs, double.
845;the movie is set in Orange County (San Clemente), and the movie's big hook is that it's an update of those terrific film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.
846;The dialogue is full of clever pithy lines and slang that went out with Eisenhower (Beautiful woman: Do you trust me now?
847;The directing is also terrific .
848;levitt makes a likeable protagonist amidst the crazy proceedings and characters, including a rather magnetic Lukas Haas as The Pin.
849;Although making the film in noir style is essentially a stunt, the tone helps make the movie deeper, more satisfying .
850;easily one of the most intricate teen dramas ever made.
851;Highly recommended for fans of film noir or sophisticated teen dramas.
852;What Brick brings to the table is perhaps the most refreshing look at the genre of Film Noir in years.
853;Rian Johnson is able to take the critical elements of the genre and transpose them on a fresh new locale.
854;The use of a Southern California highschool as the backdrop is beautifully done.
855;What is most amazing is how surprisingly real the film seems, despite the fact that yes .
856;Yet somehow Johnson brings in elements of real.
857;life high school drug culture, real.
858;life Southern California, and most of all real.
859;life fantasies about how to act when you are part of these cultures.
860;this was the best film I've seen in years, to be honest.
861;emergence of Film Noir, arguably one of the most interesting and conflicted genres of film (in my opinion).
862;Yes, there is action and violence, but the movie has a very intricate dialouge to follow, many words.
863;Very unique way of presenting a film, I believe pulled of nicely, with some great camera work as well.
864;A great independent film, if you like the Movie Kids, Requium for a Dream, or Spun, than this movie might interest you to see.
865;The movie was great and am very happy to have a copy.
866;Very intense dense plot with twists pulling attention.
867;among the best movies i have ever seen.
868;solid acting weaved into a modern version of the old detective movies.
869;this movie is great, beautifully written and well put together.
870;It is artistic and stylish without taking away from the movie and very well rounded.
871;I really enjoyed this movie and it grabbed me within the first few minutes.
872;top, but I saw this as being part of the parody.
873;Brick is a bit surreal, a bit noir, and a bit high school drama.
874;What makes the film interesting and gives it its twist, is that the story feels as if it was written for a cast in their thirties.
875;appropriate cast, though, it would have been more of a cliche whodunit mystery.
876;Instead, it plays out in an interestingly unique way.
877;He's still a strong actor and helps carry the film's emotional core.
878;Each character substitution for the classic detective story is here, and each one is well played.
879;the film wraps up cleanly and leaves the viewer satisfied.
880;Brick is definitely worth checking out, though.
