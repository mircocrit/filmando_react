1;The gun Kate Beck uses sounds like a toy gun.
2;Here's my opinion for why I think the Underworld series is infinitely superior to Twilight in every way.
3;So when Selene investigates why the Lycans are after Michael, both are pulled into a dangerous adventure full of hidden secrets, forbidden love, and a lot of intense, bloody action scenes.
4;The plot for the most part is good, but it doesn't seem to go as far as it could have.
5;mUSIC: The music in this film is great, and never fails to set the mood and entertain.
6;A true splendor of awesome bloody violence.
7;These actors are great, unlike the 1.
8;Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and pulls of her role as a vampire action heroine very well.
9;I have no gripes with the other actors either, as they perform their roles superbly as well.
10;This is an awesome action epic that both girls and guys alike can get into.
11;tHE GOOD: Lots of bloody mayhem, great acting, great music, and a fairly good plot.
12;The most notable is Michael's back story (for those of you who wondered who that girl was in the picture in his apt.)
13;Also includes great full length commentary with Len, Kate and Scott.
14;The acting is great and the story was well written, I can't say anything bad about this movie.
15;There is plenty of action and good strong characters in this movie.
16;underworld was a pretty good movie.
17;and i was impressed with most of the scenes from this movie.
18;There are certain genre conventions with vampires and werewolves.
19;At the beginning of the film she learns that the lycans are interested in a certain human, so the rest of the story revolves around her figuring out why the human is so important.
20;the characters of the movie made it though.
21;Michael, the human, was interesting.
22;Plus, yeah, he was a little attractive.
23;Lucian, the head Lycan, was my favorite, and when you watch the movie you will see why.
24;But this also gives the movie an Any.
25;so, as far as style, the movie has great mood.
26;Its hard to come up with something completly new.
27;I believe they were well chosen and did a good job.
28;Not really BIG name actors, so you could look at them and see their characters, and not *who* they are in real life.
29;the premise is actually interesting: Vampire and Werewolves are not friendly with each other.
30;Just walk into any Hot Topic store and feast your eyes.
31;Could it be that the dirctor Len Wiseman wanted Kate Beckinsale all to himself and that alone prevented a good movie from being a fine art film.
32;the allure of this movie ranged from the brilliant choreography, the fast paced action and excellent dialogue.
33;Guns blazing in tune with the riveting story only brings the point home.
34;You want to watch a good, fun vampyre movie?
35;This is a fine addition to the epic masterpiece.
36;"Yes the first reaction when seeing the preview was ""ok this will be a matrix clone in vision"" but still sparked my interest."
37;What was really great about this movie is the set up that is obvious of the huge back story that they will be able to elaborate on come the sequel.
38;up will be a fantastic success hopefully spawning more stories of the characters developed in this 1st installment.
39;If you are a fan of Vampires and Werewolves you will be very happy with the final turn out of Underworld.
40;The look, sound and over all feeling are well played out and a great treat to fans of this sort of genre.
41;all the blacks are deep and rich.
42;If you read the books you will like the movies.
43;great action movie with vampires, werewolves and KATE!!
44;I enjoyed this movie it's a keeper!
45;eating in favor of secret and well.
46;funded organizations hidden from human view, complete with high.
47;In this pic, the lovely and smoothly efficient werewolf.
48;Secret plots and ancient betrayals are revealed, Celine's vampire 'coven' is revealed to be led by a power.
49;hungry traitor, and she awakens the dormant master vampire to help deal with the situation.
50;What makes or breaks a picture like this is its ability to draw you in and excite you, and Underworld fails, but not by too much.
51;In good vampire movies and books, such as the Anne Rice examples, vampires are enthralling because of the nightmarish contrast between their godlike powers and their savage bestialty.
52;vampires, when presented properly, are very cool and menacing (I've never been at all interested in werewolves, but that's just me), but Underworld instead mostly gives us some dandies running around with guns.
53;This whole series is great!
54;Kate beckinsale is awesome and kicks ass.
55;I highly recommend this movie.
56;This is the type of movie you can watch over and over.
57;Worth the time and enjoyable for anyone over 16 due to graphic content with a great deal of violence.
58;With a beautiful lead actor as selene and a cute guy playing michael corvin.
59;I love this movie it is the end the very end!
60;Lots of vampire and werewolves, and very little love in the movie.
61;Michael sheen is in ths too his character is awesome I love this movie!
62;I recommend this to any who loves vampire or werewolves!
63;day metropolis, the story asks the true film noir question: what is the right thing to do, and is the price worth it?
64;the story is, at its heart, a story about consequences.
65;The female lead, Selene, is a vampire who serves her people without question .
66;Their supernatural qualities are used intelligently, to emphasize their humanity and hold a mirror up in front of our face.
67;real power of the Vampire overlords.
68;in the end, this is the true strength of Underworld.
69;with the setting, with the effects, with the characters, and with the story.
70;In doing so, he manages to make Underworld more than just the sum of its familiar action.
71;adventure components, and turn it into a film that makes you think.
72;While it is certainly not a classic film epic, it is a rock.
73;solid movie that easily deserves 4 stars.
74;"the whole thing is just so derivative, mostly of ""The Matrix"" trilogy but also to a certain extent of the ""Blade"" movies."
75;as the initially bewildered Michael, Speedman is one of the best casting choices.
76;He's actually in cahoots with him.
77;The scene is set for an all out war.
78;"Hard to believe that cinematographer Tony Pierce Roberts also shot Merchant Ivory's `Room With a View""."
79;it's a movie for teenage Goths who believe the key to horror monsters is to look cool and strike poses.
80;I was pleasantly surprized by the film.
81;i quickly stopped viewing this as a horror film and began seeing it as a who done it .
82;It is a good who done it .
83;Knew what I wanted all is fine.
84;This is one of a series that once again gives me the great pleasure in seeing the delectable Kate Beckinsale.
85;Oh yeah, the characters and plot has that classic feel of aristocracy and castes.
86;as well as the mayhem that a Vamp movies should project.
87;I've seen this movie several times and continue to be amazed and the plot and visual look of the movie.
88;I keep finding new subtle things in the movie overlooked in my first viewing.
89;This movie is the starter for a 3 movie collection.
90;Telling some of the history and moving forward with this story.
91;Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.
92;the story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves.
93;"This story focuses on ""a human"" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races."
94;A very impressive movie with stunning visual look.
95;Highly recommended and added to my list of favorite movies.
96;I thought they did a really good job considering the unbelievable plot that they tackled.
97;The graphics were excellent and the werewolves looked great.
98;This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.
99;The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled.
100;with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre.
101;A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled human touch portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles.
102;Even both of the Vampires movies had attractive characters even if only a few.
103;But the makers of this film make it their primary focus.
104;the acting is for the most part cheesy or bad, the actors are good looking, the plot has truck sized holes, and the it all has a slick and stylized look.
105;so they are looking for a solution in the form of an individual, the decendent of some special individual.
106;the movie has some good if improbable action sequences.
107;The costumes and the sets were spectacular.
108;ray] This is definitely on of the best movies combining Vampires and Werewolves.
109;The special effects are excellent and Kate Beckingsale is excellent as the lead.
110;I enjoyed and own both movies on Blu.
111;And yes, the action is great and so is the mood of both films.
112;Fresh, original, a movie worth watching over and over.
113;Underworld is a gothic and beautiful film with great acting and a fairly good script.
114;This is the film that started it all, and perhaps should have ended it all.
115;The film is dressed up rather nicely, with some really nice production and costume design (Les Wiseman knows his way around a set, that's for sure) but the start to finish production is just off to me.
116;This is the case with this movie as well.
117;if you like the gothic look and are a sci.
118;fi/action fan give this one a shot, butdon't expect an epic tale as it won't be had here.
119;This movie had so much potential but I feel that it never came through.
120;I love the idea and the atmosphere it provides is excellent.
121;It's hard to find a really good horror/sci.
122;I just hope that the extended edition has something more to offer.
123;I love this movie so to get more insight into the story by getting to see more footage is very rewarding.
124;There were a couple of parts that I could have done without but this one shows more story and a bit a skin.
125;The former being very interesting to me because I really dig the story and this one definitely provides more insight to the characters themselves.
126;I HIGHLY recommend this disc to anyone that's a fan of Underworld.
127;fic movies that presents vampires and were.
128;It is a great movie for anyone who's interested in that genre.
129;Totally worth it just for the comic book and sketch booklet alone.
130;the transfer, in my humble opinion, is absolutely lovely.
131;I especially love how much additional kick the blue.
132;ray player, this is the version I recommend you to get.
133;If you are just like me, who just plain loves the movie, then double dipping IMO is well worth it.
134;I love this movie for its thought out plot and amazing effects.
135;I love vampire movies in this is a great twist!
136;Nice setting to an interesting film.
137;what could have been an interesting take on the Romeo and Juliet syndrome turns into a tale of slaughter and deep.
138;seated hatreds, new species, and downright bloody action.
139;Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman portray their parts quite nicely, though, decent acting all around.
140;The writing was surprisingly good, though not great, but certainly keeping it out of the basement otherwise known as the B. movie category.
141;The plot twists and turns many a time in this tale, keeping you on your toes and bringing in new elements every step of the way.
142;In the end, you know what's going to happen most likely, it's how you get there that makes it worthwhile.
143;overall, sure I'll give it 4 out of 5 stars.
144;UNDERWORLD is original and entertaining.
145;While on the hunt she uncovers a powerful plot that will destroy the vampire elders and shift the balance of power.
146;It's intelligent with a strong plot and some new twists.
147;Finally a vampire/werewolf flick that delivers.
148;rAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful transfer.
149;ray really shines with a movie like this that is filmed with dark lighting schemes.
150;Maybe I should watch it in French some time, and see if they get more sounds.
151;something that in itself is more rooted in roleplaying games that actual history, is a film with Shakespearean and Copollan themes.
152;There is tradition, hierarchy, turf, consolidations of power, and treaties between enemies.
153;The lycanthropes are passionate and tempermental, and are savage in the way they fight and kill.
154;Contrast this to the vampires who are cool, aloof, distance.
155;what I enjoy about Underworld is the fast paced action and that aforementioned blend of vampire and mobster movies.
156;"I anticipated combat involving tooth and nail, literally
157;The pressures put upon Beckinsale and others because of tradition and habit are the kind that are found in Scorsese and Coppola crime dramas.
158;Rather, what you will get is a vampire film that takes itself seriously and strives for originality.
159;i remember and loved Frank Langella's Dracula back when it was a new movie.
160;So, I have my own expectations about vampire films in general.
161;I still found much to enjoy in this movie.
162;I also enjoyed the visual work of the film.
163;As a side note, those interested in seeing how color and light add tension to a film should see Mamoru Oshii's landmark film, Avalon.
164;convincing CG work done on transformed werewolves.
165;It's still better than what the previous decade of horror films brought, though I don't feel it stands up to An American Werewolf in London, and I certainly don't feel it measures up in the age dominated by films like The Lord of the Rings and the new Star Wars prequals.
166;This production really had a lot going for it.
167;looking production design costumes, and an interesting concept.
168;serious poseur of an action/horror film that brings in every already.
169;and touting them as anything resembling refreshing or creative.
170;I went to see this movie fully expecting a gothic, edgy, beautifully shot horror movie.
171;The scenery is OK when you can see it, the nicest scenes being in the Vampyre's lair.
172;I saw """"Blade"""" and enjoyed it, even if it was violent and a little dumb."""
173;i see a lot of movies and can appreciate a good flick.
174;couteur with vampires and werewolves.
175;There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath.
176;Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in.
177;Who knew that she could be convincing as an action.
178;spoken demeanor actually gives her ass.
179;appeal and both fuses well together.
180;degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular.
181;The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them.
182;Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth.
183;I am fan of vampire movies, well done of course.
184;I found the plot to be interesting and the characters well fleshed out.
185;It must the year of strong female characters, Kill Bill movies, Underworld, and Resident Evil: Apocalypse.
186;I say it is worth a look, who knows you might love the movie as much as some us did or you might hate it like some of the others, but see it for yourself and decide.
187;Still considering the budget they had to work with, it was impressive enough as a first film.
188;so I picked up the extended cut.
189;This movie is one of the best I have seen.
190;I am a true werewolf fan and these are some of the best I have seen.
191;And to some people's dismay, the werewolves are actually real people inside those suits.
192;Very little CGI in this movie which is what makes it great.
193;Kate Beckinsale looking hotter than ever in the leather also puts on a great touch.
194;This movie is by far one of the best I have seen as far as the transformations.
195;Nonstop action from the minute the movie starts.
196;Great movie to watch when you want someone to be scared and jump a little bit.
197;This film had a great trailer, and I've enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in other films, so I thought I'd give this a try.
198;"The film is gorgeous to look at, but by the end I really didn't care about any of these characters
199;sort of like a fantastic.
200;the film can be heard in English or French with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.
201;Now I know you may I'm crazy for saying that but it's my personal opinion.
202;Blade is good but Trinity although good it left me very disapointed.
203;The story line feels a bit more detailed and you get to know Micheal Corvin a litte better as well.
204;This is worth $20 bucks.
205;But as long as you get this movie your still smart and have good taste.
206;The fight scenes are ok, but it has some cool weapons and cars.
207;The acting is ok, and theres tons of blood, some badwords, and a suprise plot twist, that literally takes you by surpise, which I add is very interesting.
208;Its one of the few actully likeable scenes.
209;Another plot twist is when an another charater gets biten and has both vampire and lycan blood, another few likeable scence.
210;Would recommend to any vampire fan.
211;to see the whole movie!
212;Underworld is a sleek documentary on the plight of rats living inside a cave beneath Grand Central terminal in NYC, stated for demolition in 2006.
213;I found it not only humanistic, because it advocates adopting stray rats, but also very entertaining and I had tears in my eyes near the end when I walked out of the theater and found myself surrounded by gerbils.

216;This film is definatly a good marriage between rome and juliet and the horror genre.
217;good soundtrack and osme really intresting characters
218;Once I got past all Beckinsale dressed up in a tight.
219;fitting PVC catsuit (Every man's dream!)
220;I realized that this was a pretty well.
221;As the movie moved along, I became impressed by its level of creativity and invention.
222;And it's a beautifully styled film as well.
223;In the extended cut, we are treated to lots of extras, included a very entertaining audio commentary by the director, Beckinsale, and Scott Spedman.
224;In addition, the documentaries that are included in this set offer loads of information on the entire process of creating this entertaining movie.
225;the """"Buffy the Vampire Slayer"""" movie holds onto the left end of the bell curve with a death grip ."""
226;is matrix kind of action and good vampire movie I seems pass few years .
227;cheapest did find in Internet world was $23.00, But DAMN, still is high price.
228;I thought this movie was pretty entertaining overall.
229;There is a debate over whether the vampires should be going around shooting at werewolves (or lycans as they are called here) instead of hand to hand combat, but I found that a bit refreshing as the hand to hand can get a little tiresome after a while.
230;Scott Speedman was a surprise, in that I've never found him too alluring and here he was very sexy and I thought the chemistry between him and Kate was really good.
231;I hope that a certain head lycan will come back too, as the actor was very good and his charactor the most intriguing.
232;Really, I had to work up the courage to watch this one.
233;Oh yeah, but cleverly the writers added the extra depth and dimension of.
234;Two, the silver injection for werewolves.
235;Great story, great action, it moves right along with never a dull moments.
236;It's thrilling and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
237;I thought is was a decent movie worth watching, but there was not near enough action scenes.
238;The action scenes and the special effects were good when they actual happened but the movie left alot to be desired.
239;If you are looking for a good movie, good storyline, or good scare.
240;tight leather, this is your movie.
241;Most of the fighting is done with high.
242;They make the change quite more often.
243;if you can put aside the predictability and the lack of Vampires being traditional Vampires, then this film will go over quite well with you.
244;It's a good story, though a bit contrived.
245;Dusk 'till Dawn was fun, but not great.
246;this movie was a solidly good one from an action movie standpoint.
247;i enjoyed the action and definitely enjoyed Kate Beckinsale running around in tight black Matrix.
248;Both of them are far more worthy of your time.
249;the special effects were pretty good.
250;well, actually I haven't even seen it, but it looks pretty cool.
251;the trailer for this looked amazing.
252;The lighting, the design, the actors and their clothes are all gorgeous.
253;People are executing incredible acrobatic displays all over the place and bullets are constantly flying.
254;I though that the characters were interesting, the acting was good, and the story compelling.
255;The feel and visuals were excellent and consistant through the film.
256;the creators have a wonderful vision and know what they want to show us, but this is a young crew.
257;Even so, it is a good movie that I will watch again.
258;copied) action sequences, and a whole lot of guns, guns equipped with magic sunlight bullets.
259;The main character is what's known as a death dealer, not sure what puts her above the rest of her clan, since they all seem quite capable of dealing death, but hey, the title is gothy and sounds cool, so we'll keep it.
260;Okay, sounds kinda neat, kind of a supernatural Romeo and Juliet.
261;But these characters, especially our heroine, should be above these things, but of course, you have to have the angsty I love you but shouldn't love you and now I'll betray my family story for unclear reasons.
262;Best:1) It's stylish, dark and gothic to the hilt (for people who love that kind of thing).2) The creature effects makeup, CGI rendering and fight action was outstanding.3) There's a complex story to go with the visuals and things happen that you won't expect.4) There's plenty of special features including 4 documentaries and 2 commentary tracks.
263;recommendation:If you really like vampire and werewolf movies, this film adds yet another twist to the old legends.
264;For its genre it's an exceptional piece of cinema.
265;I love Kate is this movie.
266;I love this whole movie cause nonstop action and has a really good story to tell about the werewolfs and Vampires.
267;I love the actors in this whole movie.
268;Yes there is kinda of a love story in this movie also.
269;This movie is my Favorite one that i can watch over and over again.
270;Oh boy i was dead wrong about me not liking this movie but i really loved this movie.
271;I love how Kate plays the vampire and saving the vampire race at the same time.
272;I love the action parts as well as the story.
273;I give this movie 5 stars cause its a really good vampire movie at there so far.
274;I LOVE this movie, I loved every second of it!
275;If you like the Blade trilogy, or even the Matrix trilogy but with a vampiric twist, you'll love Underworld.
276;great movie, and this Unrated cut is better in my opinion.
277;I have always enjoyed these Underworld movies since I am a little bit of a horror and science fiction nut anyway so I really like these movies.
278;It has a pretty good story and acting with great effects.
279;The dark mood of the movie is also very nice.
280;This film actually gets 3 1/2 stars in my opinion.
281;the one redeeming grace in this movie is the visuals.
282;Let's hope so, because the idea of these two warring factions is intriguing still.
283;After the previews, I was ready to really enjoy the movie.
284;The premise, though getting a bit old, still appeals to me.
285;I got the impression that she was trying to project her idea of what macho should look like.
286;if you are looking for a saturday night movie for background noise while you enjoy a night with friends, this is great.
287;the weaving of Nighy's and Beckinsale's history into the film grants a humanity that extends the scope of acceptance to viewers who are not intimately familiar or even remotely interested in Vampire or Werewolf lore.
288;"As well extending the plot beyond the baseless erradication of one ""species"" by the other to the bloodline experiment that results in the creation of a ""new"" creature is genius."
289;i own this movie because the writing and acting were phenomenal.
290;Though I grant that supernatural beings can combat each other without the aid of pistols and sub.
291;A good job of stretching the envelope on Vampire stories.
292;"It may not quite be up to the action in ""Blade"", but it certainly has a great storyline, interesting characters, good special effects, and hot music."
293;I couldn't pass it up since in my humble opinion there haven't been enough decent Vampires movies in the last ten years, and this is worth seeing again and again.
294;"This may not quite stack up to the first Blade movie, but it is better than ""Blade II"" or John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" in my opinion."
295;This movie grows on you the more you watch it.
296;"The first time I watched ""Resident Evil"" I thought it was good but it took multiple viewings to really appreciate it."
297;Each time I see it I pick up something new and develop more respect for the acting and directing.
298;Cool user menu graphics and interface.
299;Includes commentaries, making of, trailer, and other extras.
300;I chose the vampires all the way.
301;Kate Beckinsale, I have to say, gave the best performance of her career.
302;There is going to be a sequel because it is underway right now.
303;Good special effects, a quite decent concept, good actors, good sets and backgrounds, in general a great feeling to the movie, but the plot suffered a little.
304;This is an instant cult classic.
305;The acting for one is very nicely done and i eagerly awaited the second one and was so happy when I saw it.
306;The special features are a great watch because they go into such good detail on how they made the movie and the costumes that they used.
307;A must see film for the science fiction genre lover.
308;disc Unrated Extended Cut, and has a bonus disc.
309;great, GREAT cinematography and costumes.
310;I read a lot of vampire books, but finding a good vampire movie was extremely hard.
311;fast, weirdly believable, dark, and with a touch of romance.
312;I absolutely loved it and just had to get the extended edition, which adds much to the originally wonderful movie.
313;this vampire/werewolf horror story just oozes with unique twists, spectacular action, awesome environments, and mostly great acting.
314;beckinsale, as Selene, looked terrific, acted terrific, and really made the movie what it was.
315;She played her action scenes well and made it look like she was an veteran action heroine.
316;she played her parts with plenty of eye candy, flair, and grace to spare.
317;A truly awesome performance on her part.
318;her love interest, Scott Speedman, was also great and he generated a great deal of believable emotion and reality in his transformation parts and his 'what the f is going on' parts.
319;The fact that this movie had an intricate history and actual plot behind its characters made you side with its actors that much more.
320;I loved Lucian at the start when he was a 'bad guy' and i loved him even more at the end when he became a 'tragic hero' in his own little way.
321;And the ending, with its slow silent face to face shot and fitting background music, really hit the mark.
322;from its great plot that was ever surprising, to its beautiful settings, scenary, and gothic environments, and to the vicious, growling, and awesome looking werewolves, this was a fun movie to watch.
323;I have watched and owned it, but I got rid of it finally.
324;But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie.
325;It is a great movie with great heart.
326;, does a great job, as a kick.
327;On the other hand it's a very entertaining movie to watch and very nicely done all around.
328;The dark and modern time vampire world is blended in with werewolf's and made into the 2 main characters.
329;The movie is one to watch over and over again.
330;With a realization of, all this could be true, that you would only hope for.
331;The most fantastic,left on the edge of your seats, ending, and the best selection of music put together ever created.
332;A movie (my favorite movie)i envy for being so realistic, a movie i hope, and wish, they will make a sequel to.
333;and put up with some really poorly acted scenes (ie: every one that has a confrontation between Beckinsdale and the #2 vampire chick), but in the end, it's a fun movie to watch.
334;Combining supernatural with high tech, fang teeth with martial arts, 17th century elegance with rock music, and ancient evil with sexy Goth costumes, these films are as modern as modern can be, and thus succeed in transporting us to a supernatural dream setting that is nonetheless intriguingly familiar.
335;add to this the mix of terror and heart.
336;breaking beauty, as patented by Anne Rice.
337;girl appeal that is accentuated rather than diminished by the sexy leather outfit.
338;In the very few times she uses her hands (as in the final scene where she disables Lucien's bodyguards), she shows a kind of understated grace that is very much a Kate Beckinsale trademark.
339;while I am obviously a Kate fan, her Selene persona was so darkly serious that putting in a wily charmer like Erika (Sophia Myles) to share a few scenes with her was, I think, a neat counterpoint.
340;found love are going to survive.
341;A worthy addition to the body of vampire lore!I suppose the well.
342;And so is the acting.
343;The movie has a great look (and not just Kate Beckinsale in tight leather .
344;The special effects are fun and effective, something that doesn't always happen in movies like this.
345;for horror or vampire fans, it's worth a watch but I dare any true believer to accept Scott Speedman as being worthy of anything more than a walking blood supply.
346;I bought it the day it came out without ever seeing it first.
347;The lure of vampires and werewolves got me and this movie is all about it!!
348;That is totally unfair to us the consumers and proves how much money is the almighty ruler to them!!!
349;As I LOVE vampire movies, this sounded so promising.
350;style love story between a vampire girl and werewolve boy.
351;every cool movie of the last decade is mined here .
352;"work stunts and long leather coats of ""The Matrix"", the kick ass action of both ""Blade"" films, the vampire ""king"" from ""Interview with the Vampire"" and every Anne Rice novel ever written ."
353;"At least she looks great, wearing Michelle Pfieffer's catsuit from ""Batman""."
354;Underworld is the most successful.
355;What results is an exciting two hours spent delving into the underground and the rivalry between feuding clans.
356;If nothing else, the film is original and exciting.
357;It features strong leading women, as well as memorable male counterparts, which makes it appeal to female audiences.
358;underworld film series for its cluster of bloodthirsty fans.
359;I love the original movie and I'm looking forward to this extended version.
360;It is a cool movie with a unique style of its own and it rocks.
361;In other words, the acting is fantastic and intense.
362;This was an great story and it was backed with special Effects that was not over played.
363;the story line drove this movie quite nicely.
364;This was still an entertaining movie and one of the best films,in my opinion, of 2003.
365;The start of the movie starts with in your face action which pulled me in from the start.
366;The action is great and only stops for a little bit to make the story line cohesive.
367;the special effects of the transformation of the wherewolves where well done and not over blown.
368;The vampires did not have much to change but I felt that it was good enough for the feel of the movie.
369;I loved it and thought it to be pretty original in its own right.
370;Underworld is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time.
371;The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used.
372;The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.
373;I could watch it 100 more times and still find it fun and enjoyable.
374;Underworld is an excellent movie and i recommend it to any fans of the vampire/werewolf genre.
375;Kate Beckinsale plays selene perfectly.
376;The other cast members of the story play their parts very well and make this movie a very good movie.
377;I highly recommend this movie because it has a great story line.
378;I cant wait till the next one comes out it should be a great movie just as good as the first if not better.
379;This is a great movie and the blu.
380;The added footage helps with the story versus the theater cut.
381;Love the action, acting and adventure!
382;Best action movie in a while, the whole series is constantly entertaining and well done all around.
383;This is a slick film.
384;From the filming locations to the wardrobe worn by the actors, this film is definitely about style.
385;The plot centers around a beautiful female vampire named Selene.
386;She lives for the kill and hates them with a passion.
387;The Vampires and Werewolves in Underworld make good use of human technology to help them in their quest to annihilate one another.
388;This movie is similar to your common action film in that it is full of high tech firearms, computers, hip clothes, and fancy cars.
389;But it differs in that this one actually has an interesting plot.
390;Kate Beckinsale is very sexy as Selene.
391;She looks terrific in her black leather outfit.
392;I highly recommend this movie.
393;i love this movie because of kate beckinsale because she is god, and that is a fact you can take that to the bank.
394;throw her in leather and you have the perfect vision of beauty.
395;One of the few movies that you will want to watch over and over again.
396;There were many things that made this movie great (and highly underrated) when it first came out.
397;The soundtrack and special effects were fairly good, the fight scenes nice but reminiscent of the Matrix, the acting was decent .
398;The plot was unique .
399;The men (Speedman, Brolly and Sheen) and women are gorgeous: you should watch this movie if for nothing else than eye candy alone!One of the main things I liked about this movie was its originality.
400;"Bullets invested with silver nitrate, the idea of ""death dealers"", the mixed bloodlines and all it entailed, the costumes (especially the vamp ones: Amelia's outfit was excellent), the realistic feel."
401;Beckinsale's relationship with Kraven and Michael, Marcus' character/role, etc.
402;Underworld, has vampires and werewolves in the modern world, fighting each other with guns and special ammo.
403;The only good thing I could say about Underworld is that the special effects were good and the action scenes were well done.
404;Still holding true to the oldest forms of Vampires, they still require blood and are basically immortal.
405;Truly an enjoying watch for a myth buff.
406;This movie is one of my favorite movies.
407;I really like the trilogy they made.
408;"Boy was I surprised as ""Underworld"" turned out to be a really good movie."
409;"So much so that I bought ""Underworld: Evolution"" sight unseen."
410;beckinsale is wonderful, not just another pretty face, she actually has talent.
411;The rest of the cast is well cast and believable.
412;"sticking to the ""Rules"" governing Likens and Vampires, ""Underworld"" will pull you in for an exciting ride as these two sides race to end war that has been going on for centuries, but to what end?Definately worth seeing if not owning."
413;It's a very stylish `monster' movie, though .
414;beckinsdale plays Selene, our 'heroine' and the 'good' vampire.
415;all enhanced to target the specific weaknesses of the intended victim.
416;vampires are still stylish and pale, while the vampire clan still lives in an old.
417;hungry, also has designs on Selene .
418;As well as the updated weapons, werewolves .
419;or lycans, as they're known throughout the film .
420;As a result of the romance, she learns a great deal more about the origins of war and the night she was sired by Viktor.
421;this is a very enjoyable and stylish film, with some very impressive special effects.
422;Although technically, I suppose, it's a 'supernatural' movie, there's a strong thriller element to it, with plenty of gunfights, political intruige, treachery, twists and turns.
423;Absolutely recommended for those who love vampire movies.
424;loving aunt to start watching the Hammer films.
425;I had been looking forward to the release of this movie all summer long, and it was a great movie!
426;The werewolves have been researching their bloodlines and discovered a human who shares a common ancestor with both the werewolves and the vampires.
427;this aside, the movie was still pretty incredible.
428;The plot was exceptional, which is not necessarily always the case with most action movies, and the action kept me entertained throughout the movie's entirety.
429;The effects were great, and the creepy lighting added to the atmosphere of the film.
430;up and costumes were also outstanding, as was the acting.
431;This is a vampire/werewolf movie for heaven's sake!
432;It's sexy, stylish, gory and fantastic fun.
433;It's worth it just for him.
434;Watch this movie and you'll find out how.
435;The movie was very stylish and had above average special effects and decent action scenes.
436;They spent too much time making the movie look good and stylish.
437;fi/Fantasy blockbuster that came out this past year.
438;Who cares it isn't a remake of Dracula or any of the shlockey 1950's werewolf films it is its own creation and so they used what they wanted to use and made up new ideas that were creative and exciting.
439;LOL You are all taking a piece of fiction way too seriously and need to relax and enjoy the new ideas that these excellent filmamakers devloped for this film.
440;The movie was good, generally speaking.
441;The pacing was acceptable and it had everything on it, action, romance, a good plot and all.
442;Still I highly recommend the movie if you are looking for a variety of events.
443;It starts out really great.
444;the transformations of the werewolves was good the first time, when it was done mostly in the dark.
445;Kate Beckinsale did a beautiful job, and I would still say it's worth seeing in the theaters for her role, but maybe only a matinee ticket.
446;The music was good without being distracting, the dialogue was structured well, but not always delivered well.
447;If you like unique vampire movies.
448;It's well worth the money.
449;Oh yes this good and I love the series.
450;The other film was just better but this one has its high points also.
451;The Fight scenes were well done, the Plot is cool and its like a video game with all of its activities.
452;Because Len Wiseman knows how to make a great movie.
453;All I have to say is she's great at it, and heck, she looks hit doing it.
454;Anyways, the film has a great flow, not a total action packed picture but it carries your interest and the whole air of the film is just stunning and dark and worth the time to take the ride so take it.
455;watching this a 2nd time, I have to say that this film was well done and the combining of two genres (vampire/warewolf) was a great idea!All in all, very entertaining.
456;It has all the style, effects, and cinematography of these films with nothing new to offer.
457;Underworld somewhat reminded me of(atleast as far as subject content) two great Japanese anime films called Vampire Hunter D and Vampire Hunter D. bloodlust which I highly recommend instead of this film.
458;I also recommend seeing Dark City, which was the best film to come out of this genre.
459;Even though I didn't like The Crow and Blade, I recommend them above Underworld.
460;we can all imagine our own take on the vampire story, especially if you have ever played magic games, read ann rice, did live and online role playing, or even spiced up your celebration of the day of the dead.
461;matching some of my own personal colors and imagined faces and interactions in fantasy.
462;wanting to know more, wanting to do more, on a mission .
463;to enjoy and relish the visuals and new take on this story.
464;This director has a following for his work.
465;it helps that the screen play worked too.
466;See this film is entertaining, it's not horrible, but it's not great either.
467;fan for the last thirteen years I have had my level of expectations for vampire movies and literature raised so high that even White Wolf themselves can't always meet the expectations because so much of their past work has been beyond excellent.
468;There's more than enough material to go on there, you could even make a 13 volume movie series based off the clan novels, I mean really they're great!
469;be vampire movies and go for the real thing!
470;Though the plot of the film is rather incomprehensible, the film has enough style to be atleast watchable.
471;Director Len Wisemen who is recently engaged to Beckinsale) creates a nice setting to the film, with the appropriate tone.
472;The action scenes are pretty good, as well the visual effects which are passingly cool including the transformation of humans into werevolves.
473;Scott Speedman plays a human who has been bitten and has transformed into a lycan.
474;worthy acting in a film like this.
475;i thought the action was great with the small bit of love in and the story line was amazing.
476;The movie is very intersting and keeps you glued.
477;The emotions and attitudes of the characters are believable.
478;The computer graphics are obvious but they look good.
479;"And by the end of ""Underworld"" you get #2 as well."
480;hulk (right down to its one.
481;"hunter kitbag, ""Underworld"" finds its groove, and serves up a bloody two hours of unabashed techno."
482;photoelectric magnesium charges (perfect for giving that oncoming vamp a little taste of Club Med sunlight).
483;and finally, mixing it up with our fanged.
484;The movie looks gorgeous: whether it's the gloomy red.
485;Underworld also gets the most out of its talented stable of actors.
486;The Lycan overlord Lucien (the gifted Welsh actor Michael Sheen) steals every scene he's in, and brings complexity and command to a role that could have been a throwaway in lesser hands.
487;Finally, there's the Vampire King Viktor, played by the great Bill Nighy (who also played Shaun's Jag.
488;The sets, the costumes, and the music (all in errie and bass thumping 5.1 dolby digital .
489;I first saw this movie years ago with a friend who loved it.
490;I got a little bit more than half way and abandoned it.
491;This film kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end, and I wanted it to last longer.
492;I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face.
493;But that was part of the appeal.
494;It reminded me of Blade, The Matrix, The Crow, Queen of the Damned, and a few other movies I can't remember right now.
495;And Kate Beckinsale was so hot in this film, she was absolutely perfect!!
496;This was a fun movie, I hope they make a sequel, and I hope this one makes some money to justify it.
497;I am a huge fan of vampire, werewolf, dark side movies and this one has a great atmosphere and completes the story while leaving it open for the whole series.
498;It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.
499;There is this huge back.
500;story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.
501;There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.
502;She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.
503;It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.
504;This movie would make a great television or comic book series.
505;Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.
506;If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.
507;it seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level.
508;i longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.
509;I wanted cool action sequences, but I also wanted some compelling characters and interesting story developments.
510;I thought this was an outstanding take on the Vampire Werewolf genre together with great action and cinematography and good acting.
511;well, she's always worth watching, right?
512;Kate Beckinsale was the best in this movie.
513;A well thought out movie with lots of a action sequences mostly gunfights.
514;The stunts Kate did were really cool.
515;This is an awesome movie.
516;i love this movie the actors are awesome, the story is awesome and the action is awesome.
517;kate beckinsale is beautiful and awesome.
518;this is a great movie.
519;and i like how they cobine cgi and practical effects looks great.
520;Good story and great special effects.
521;I was always both wary of it due to scathing reviews, and yet curious about it due to its subject matter.
522;I simply want to state that this film is destined to become a cult classic.
523;"cGI Lycans (even a scene where Lycans are running toward the camera on the walls of a corridor was done with stunt men and digitally erased cables)
524;She was certainly as entertaining if not more so than Tank Girl or Stripperella!
525;If you enjoy watching black leather.
526;Worth seeing for a number of laughable sequences, including one in which Beckinsale expends about 1,100 rounds from two handheld automatic pistols to create a Looney Tunes.
527;For not being a big budget movie, they did well with what they had.
528;all in all I thought it was a well done movie, and you would never know that it was made with a fraction of the money spent on the Matrix's second movie!
529;It has a wonderful additional special footage.
530;The extended scenes are fabulous!
531;Ten times more the action, ten times more suspense, and ten times more romance.
532;The good news is that I do think the picture is visibly better.
533;This also helps some of the dark scenes (many in this movie) with more visible detail.
534;Compare this, for example, to a movie shot in digital and you'll see what I mean.
535;so, in the end I'd say that Superbit is great if you really love a movie and want the best PQ you can get for it.
536;Don't usually watch this type of movie, but this is so well done.
537;fi/action masterpiece released Sept 19 of that year.
538;day weaponry and very believeable scenarios makes this the thriller of the year.
539;the film's shining star is in fact, the screenwriting and directing"
540;time ambience and the subtle but convincing eerieness of the entire plot.
541;plots along with the main story, making this a 'see it again' classic.Yes, Matrix and Terminator sequels are great.
542;underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.
543;A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.
544;With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.
545;It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!
546;She is an amazing talent.
547;When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.
548;With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.
549;I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film.
550;this is an excellent movie!!
551;I was at first against this movie, but after seeing it i really enjoyed this flick, i love werewolves and this had great transformations and gore effects, and am amazing plot twist!!
552;This is by far the best vampire movie I have ever seen.
553;It is intense throughout the entire movie action all the way!!!
554;"The whole idea of werewolved versus vampires is a very interesting concept and I had some high expectations for the release of 2003's ""Underworld""."
555;The special effects are really good and so are a lot of the action sequences.
556;The acting is decent though.
557;I've seen it before, it's a new classic.
558;The action sequences are great.
559;I'll watch it many more times and I won't grow tired of it.
560;I've been a fan of comic book heroes and herorines since I was old enough to read and Kate Beckinsale's character was the classic comic book heroine.
561;"I rate her character right along side that of Ellen Ripley ""Alien(s)"" etc, and that is high praise for a first outing in strong action heroes."
562;Ms Beckinsale is strong, sexy, smart and wow, what an outfit.
563;She also give a classic style gothic character portrayal of a woman not to be babied or toyed with.
564;The concept was fresh also.
565;Speedman was an incredible portrait of a combination Lycan/Vampire that was powerful, sleek and handsome.
566;The special effects and makeup departments worked over.
567;Instead of a lot of CGI creatures, I was very excited by the return to the human influence in the creatures.
568;The suits and animatronics added a 3.
569;This just might be the best of this type movie that I have ever seen.
570;"As good a Spiderman, better than the ""Hulk""."
571;It's okay, though: the film moves fairly fast, and Kate Beckinsale looks great in all those tight leather/vinyl jumpsuits.
572;That is a revelation in itself, as most adaptation of the two monsters don't have them at odds in warfare with each other.
573;'Underworld' is a nice twist on the old vampire and werewolve stories.
574;this movie also borrows from other sources, and blends them quite well.
575;There is a getaway scene in a car that is reminiscent of 'Terminator 2,' a showdown in the later stages of the movie that brings 'Aliens' to mind, and some early action scenes that are clearly inspired by 'The Matrix.'
576;On the upside, these influences create a movie that is visually exciting in terms of action and very suspenseful at points.
577;as for my gripes about the movie, I'll start with the similar appearance of many of the characters.
578;In addition, while the movie does a great job of being mysterious in the beginning, some of the revelations are a bit of a let down in their timing throughout the movie.
579;overall, its a very enjoyable movie.
580;This movie is geared much more towards action, story, and suspense.
581;I was forced to go see this movie when it was first released and I laughed through the whole thing.
582;go see a Hammer Studios vampire flick, such as Taste The Blood Of Dracula.
583;If this movie is taken at face value and simply enjoyed as a violent, gothic horror story, then it is very entertaining.
584;The movie is just the most beautiful thing to look at.
585;This is assuredly not a movie for everbody.
586;Those of you who look at movies for the occassional mindless entertainment, or for great technique, then this is for you.
587;I stayed because of a friend.
588;My favorite scene was when some vampire jumps on top of a car and sticks a knife inbetween the driver and passenger side seats, like he thought someone might be there.
589;if you like action and a forrbiden love story in between this is the movie for you.
590;Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, sets his sights on a mortal named 'Michael' to be transformed into this champion for them.
591;viktor wages elegantly with the furious amalgamated warrior, and in an unexpected twist, Selene goes sword to sword with Viktor, ending with a most interesting strike.
592;the film is repleat with enjoyable dark environments, leather.
593;clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action.
594;"adventure {not horror},, in a general ""Buffy""/VanHelsing."
595;I found this movie amusing.
596;I love the Matrix clothing, and I love vampires, and though it was light in the plot, I didn't think it was a waste of my time.
597;I actually enjoyed watching it, and will no doubt watch it again, and see the sequel.
598;and much of it can be traced back to folkloric beliefs.
599;Underworld is a stylish, gory, action filled horror movie, based on three premises.
600;it's all Matrix, from the costuming to the choreography, the cinematography, the lighting.
601;superbly done, but blatantly stolen.
602;The real interest in Vampires vs. Werewolves would be how they physically matched up.
603;and when the film did develop this, it was really unique, with Vampires more agile but incapable of flight or shapeshifting, and Werewolves slower but vastly more powerful.
604;,Plotwise, though, the Vampires vs. Werewolves idea worked well, and was developed in an interesting and unexpected fashion.
605;Acting was quite good, with a touch of overacting to be expected from such a topic, and the casting excellent.
606;anyway, in spite of its flaws, it's certainly entertaining and worth watching, at least once.
607;It is about as interesting as a game of stickball between eight year olds.
608;First off this was a good film.
609;"(So the watcher never got those cool ""matrix"" shots.)"
610;He got shot in the back.
611;Okay the good guys win.
612;If you can get over that it had a vary good story line, and some cool morphs between humanoid and wolfish.
613;The commentary is fantastic though, from the director, and 2 writers.
614;the black guy with very cool and deep voice.
615;The vampires got reflections in mirrors, and they didnt show parts when they actually killed people to feed.
616;And it kinda go slow at some parts too, but I cant blame them since its the first of a trilogy, and the first movie usually takes more dragging parts to introduce the plots and characters.
617;, I think the movie got a deep story with a lot of twists and turns, and almost all characters have their own agendas.
618;which makes it so interesting and making you want to know what happens on the next installment.
619;I hope they will finally make real vampires!
620;There are two kinds of directorial debuts.
621;There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically.
622;acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like Underworld.
623;wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from Matrix .
624;lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps.
625;And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy.
626;Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant.
627;I liked this movie very much, being a fan of vampire movies and books, I got this movie as a present and really enjoyed the visuals, action and the goth.
628;and using the film to explore race and social issues in a vampire/werewolf context was very interesting, good movie for a rainy day.
629;The way the story was written is good.
630;there are some memorable moments filled with action,but ultimately these are seldom.
631;in my opinion the movie was enjoyable but not worth owning.
632;"This is the most unabashedly Gothic, ""graphic."
633;"Underworld is a look into the unseen world of the ""denizens of the dark"" (Vampires and Lycans) and their ""unseen"" war that have raged over 600 years."
634;like romance to make you feel for the main protagonist of the story.
635;And did I mention that Kate Beckinsale really brings a lot into her role and this movie (not least of which is the fact that she really looks very good as a Gothic, vampire.
636;it's really a lot better.
637;I look forward to seening the next come along action to vies.
638;I loved the original but the extended version is even better and filled with extras making it worth the extra $$.
639;say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.
640;This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.
641;the stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.
642;i really enjoyed this film on a visual level.
643;For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.
644;So, I waited for a really good sale.
645;It will be fun to watch around Halloween.
646;You've got art!Of course, vampires are enjoying a reasonable rebirth as of late.
647;As with the vast vampire subculture, there's plenty of blood here for good stories.
648;It's full of big ideas .
649;including Kate Beckingsale whose behind looks absolutely spectacular in leather.
650;I absolutely LOVE this movie, it is so awesome and I love how the first and second work off each so well.
651;This movie was a surprise.
652;I went and saw it in the theaters with a couple of friends on a Saturday night when we had nothing to do.
653;I thought the premise sounded cool I love Kate Beckinsale.
654;There is just something about the story, how it was shot, the characters, and the look style of the film that appeals to me.
655;the story of vampires vs. werewolves is an interesting one.
656;The special effects are done pretty well.
657;I found this to be a plus.
658;The storyline is quite interesting, espcially when Selene awakens Viktor, the oldest and most powerful vampire.
659;the acting here is decent, with Beckinsale doing the best job of the bunch.
660;It's about killer gunfights and looking good while in them.
661;This film has style and sleekness dripping from it.
662;I just hope they make a sequal.
663;The featurettes are ok, but nothing great.
664;Fun and entertaining first movie of a very fun and entertaining series.
665;This is the best dark movie I have ever seen for a long time now.
666;Truly amazing plot, action sequence and characters.
667;however I truly believe that Underworld is underrated.
668;It should get the credits that it deserved or putting such an excellent movie.
669;Worth adding to your library if you like this type of movie and especially if you are into the series.
670;Well good for you, (saw you in Van Hesling,) very good acting.
671;Very believable worked for me here in this movie and their in that movie.Yes, and we must leave room for romance, and this movie has that.
672;I love a good vampire movie.
673;"I'm not expecting Masterpiece Theater, I just want to be entertained, and entertained I was with ""Underworld""."
674;I loved the dark, moody atmosphere of the entire film.
675;I thought it was amazing how the werewolves were actually costumes as opposed to resorting to the cheesy CGI most movies relies on nowadays (which I think is way too much).
676;She reminded me a lot of Toni Halliday, the singer from the modern rock band Curve.
677;The film is very sleek and stylish.
678;"I can definitely see where the comparisons of the movie to other films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade"" comes in (like on the fight sequences) but ""Underworld"" still holds its own."
679;stop thrill ride for me.
680;Underworld is a fun, non.
681;"I especially dug the ""Fangs Vs. Fiction"" segment and watching the cast of the film talk about making the film."
682;I loved the outtake reel.
683;It is always interesting for me to see the actors goof up on their lines in movies.
684;I liked the 48 page comic book and the sketchings on the entire film.
685;This movie comes so close to achieving what both the Matrix and Star Wars did.
686;i swear I thought this was going to be the next classic when I saw the brilliantly well made shot where Selene throws her shurikens, it was just beautiful.
687;kate Beckinsale delivers an amazing performance with what could have easily been an otherwise one dimensional and boring character, it's a great credit to her talent and experience.
688;Some of the Cinematography is just awe inspiring.
689;There's plentty of other fantastic portions which make it more than worthwhile.
690;This is a great science fiction/Action film that you should add to your collection.
691;As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately.
692;There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled.
693;For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone.
694;Alas, she's still great eye.
695;On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well.
696;staged and filmed and reasonably exciting.
697;The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on.
698;screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London.
699;"It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing
700;crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere.
701;Maybe with more passionate performances, more well.
702;orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success.
703;One of the best vampire, werewolf movies to come out in a long time!
704;Plenty of action and acting that's decent enough to keep from ruining things.
705;I saw this movie a while back, and while it isn't the best movie ever, I do love the mood and theme.
706;And it's made much better in beautiful High.
707;This movie will never win any awards for acting or plotline, but for a modern day take on the classic """"horror"""" creatures it is entertaining."""
708;The commentary on the extended version with Len, Kate and 'Speedman' was quite funny.
709;This film has it all suspense, grate story line and plot, excellent speciall effects, Drama, Suspence and for those that love gothic love stories this one is right up there for you.
710;I had low expectations going in to this movie but was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was.
711;The Matrix's influence on the visual style was unmistakeable and.
712;no longer looks fresh and original.
713;the creature effects for the werewolves were very good.
714;A tight script yields a film that hits the ground running and pretty much never stops.
715;Regardless, it's worth checking out.
716;While Underworld may not be ground breaking, the sum of the parts add up to a fun evening in front of the home theater system.
717;The greatest injustice is the fact that the disc is bright RED, exactly the opposite of everything to do with the movie.
718;The costumes, the sets, the action, they all rock.
719;Kate Beckinsale will probably find more than one fan with her appearance in 'the body condom.'
720;As a work of art it isn't a masterpiece but it is definitely entertaining.
721;Before I watched this movie, I have a concrete impression about vampires in my mind.
722;this movie gives me a whole new image about vampires and their rival, werewolves.
723;Most of the time, vampires are villains and now they are the good guys.
724;He wants to fight back vampires because of revenge.
725;"kate Beckinsale is so cool in this movie, especially after watching her in ""Pearl Harbour""."
726;I can imagine she can play this character that well.
727;"Sometimes ""blending"" can make good movies."
728;The Matrix with vampires and werewolves.
729;I watched this movie last Sunday evening and found it entertaining.
730;Fine image, great soundtrack and the kind of gothic scenarios that I love.
731;Acting was good, and Ms. Beckinsale looked gorgeous in her Matrix.
732;Action sequences were fine, except for the effect of the very last sword coup, which I found hilarious rather than impressing.
733;For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning.
734;Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science.
735;filled with excitement, unraveling storyline, comic.
736;She's a soldier whose nation is threatened by the prisoner's allies.
737;So this soldier, who has always thought of herself as the protector of her people, tortures him.
738;She repeatedly twists the prisoner's wounded shoulder until the pain makes him talk.
739;what's going on in the world at the time you see a movie determines what you see in it.
740;underworld is more interesting than I thought it would be.
741;For one thing, the special effects and makeup are more believable than the cartoonish CGI in movies like The Hulk, Spider.
742;She's a very good actor.
743;the film might be saying that this decadent vampire society, which sees itself as more intellectual, more cultured, more human than the sewer.
744;bring on the guns and Armageddon.
745;Underworld was a very interesting film to watch.
746;Part horror/action film, this film manages to have a interesting and original storyline, fine cinematography and a good performance by Kate Beckinsale.
747;i liked the story, but this film just plays by the numbers.
748;Horror fans will be dissapointed with the lack of blood this film offers, but many may be glad with just the story, which has surprising twists and turns.
749;I felt sometimes this really was a low budget actioner, but it's still stylish now and then.
750;I loved this movie the first time i saw it, which was after i bought it, unlike the Blade movies which added a new spin onto Vampires this movie also adds a spin to werewolves.
751;adding substance to the plot.
752;i cant wait for the Sequel as i found this movie fantastic with it's skew on the supernatural, i thoroughly recommend it to anybody who likes films that take a new spin on sometimes cliched ideas.
753;I would recommend this product.
754;This movie was thoughly enjoyed.
755;Perched on a ledge high above a dark, rain soaked city, a woman and her companion watch and wait.
756;with the Lycans thought to be on the verge of extinction the vampires are preparing to form a new coven by merging with a powerful overseas clan.
757;The cast is good, but they do not display much emotional depth and this hinders the efforts of the audience to form a connection with the characters and care for their fates.
758;that being said, Underworld does a fantastic job with breathing new life into the vampire genre.
759;Director Len Wiseman bathes the viewers in images of eerie translucence that combine various color hues to create a look that enhances the action by surrounding it in an otherworldly ambience.
760;writers Kevin Grevioux and Danny McBride are to be commended for breathing new life into the genres as he gives us a tale that entertains yet expands upon the traditional lore of the creatures and if for nothing else, that alone makes Underworld pure entertainment and a must see film for fans of the genre.3 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach[.]
761;I still give it 5 stars, but I'm writing this review as a heads up for those who are looking for alot more in the actual movie itself, it's just not there.
762;"It's advertising campaign promised a ""Romeo and Juliet"" love story set among a war between werewolves and vampires."
763;off that is light on action, heavy on melodramatics, and big on style.
764;The stories of the two films are identical.
765;Between the blood and bullets, we are introduced to the various characters of the vampire and lycan clans.
766;"If anything else, ""Underworld"" makes for great eye candy."
767;And the wolves are the more formidable of the two species.
768;Still, the style of the film and some interesting characters save it from being a straight.
769;It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.
770;Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!
771;The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.
772;parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight.
773;the best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.
774;The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo.
775;It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.
776;It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.
777;It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.
778;Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.
779;Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.
780;This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.
781;The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.
782;She's a superb actress, emotes well, and has a face which would haunt the dreams of a Renaissance painter or sculptor.
783;"I've always been a sucker for vampire movies, and no matter whether the story is a deep, thought provoking one
784;Whether it becomes a mainstream classic or just a solid cult.
785;classic remains to be seen.
786;The story is very well written and as someone pointed out, it revolves around WHY there is a war between vampires and werewolves and less on the creatures themselves.
787;the acting is just about as superb as it can get.
788;the directing is just as superb.
789;The ending leaves the option for a sequel (which we now see is the case) and it keeps the viewer hooked for the next chapter!Highly recommened and will be a classic over the course of time.
790;It is really more of a fantasy, and as such it does quite well.
791;The story is complex and is set out effectively .
792;in conclusion, very entertaining with a nice well defined visual style.
793;The story it self has promise if it dropped all the automatics and sci.
794;she takes her job very seriously and has the clans best interest in mind.
795;untile she meets mike a human with very rare blood.
796;note this movie has many other subplots and story lines .
797;I could have loved this movie.
798;It looked great, had interesting characters and used a decent rehash of the old vampire vs werewolf story.
799;One of the great things about vampire or werewolf movies is that they are so hard to kill, allowing for great hand.
800;Underworld does indeed translate the background of Shakespeare's tragedy into sci.
801;an unexpected scene lasting under a minute .
802;for those of you who loved the style and swiftness of this movie but wanted more affection, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.
803;Bought it at another fantastic price offered by Amazon.
804;this movie is awesome on Blu.
805;The colors, the action scenes just everything is captured!The movie has a great cast, great storyline.
806;Kate Beckinsale has a powerful presence on the screen.
807;The opening scene is worth watching the movie.
808;Kate Beckinsale's stylish landing and rising is very impressive and kicks.
809;off the movie with finesse.
810;The motivations of the characters are fascinating.
811;The concept of Underworld, the Amazing Special Effects, sets and fast.
812;due to the special features, extended scenes, et al.
813;out as a must see and must see again film.
814;And a good storyline as well.
815;Good take on the whole vampire/werewolf thing.
816;I thorougly enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to.
817;Anyway, perhaps that's why it was a surprising treat to me.
818;I thought it was well done and far more enjoyable than the trailers or the poster makes one think.
819;This movie was made with a sequel in mind, just look at how it ended!
820;But I did enjoy this film, I liked the atmosphere and the characters and the story is pretty interesting (hard to follow??
821;That said, this is a really fun movie!
822;The characters are good and authentic (thanks to good acting), the story is good, the action is great.
823;What's even better: the last scene all but puts up a neon sign saying """"SEQUEL""""."""
824;SO, whether you get this extended version or the original, you will be satisfied.
825;But I came across this when i was in the mood for something that i could suspend my disbelief for and I was happy.
826;It works well with the other movies and some how adds depth when you see it after the others.
827;If you like The Matrix and Blade, then you'll love this movie.
828;It has the fight scenes and black vinyl from Matrix and a modern spin on vampires.
829;It's fun, don't listen to those other reviews!
830;Lost all my movies when we moved and this is one I had to replace and it was and is defiantly worth it!
831;I generally believe that this movie rocks.
832;well when I ordered this movie I was thin king it was going too be part 1 and 2 but unfournately not
833;I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it.
834;I really like the Blade movies and the plot seemed realy cool.
835;I was expecting a unique and god story and some awesome action and special effects.
836;The movie has a neat and cool opening fight and then.
837;And also, she seems to fire a lot but hits mostly the walls.
838;We've always keep the movies clean before playing it and the machine that we play it on but we did have some jumping.
839;roaring fanboy fun ala Riddick and Van Helsing (see my reviews).
840;off by the director's penchant for pretentious poses and making the camera linger so the audience can appreciate how cool his shots are (it is cool and has great lighting, in fairness, but does he have to be so obvious?)
841;The revelation that reveals the true relationship of vampires and Lycans was also interesting but somehow became anti.
842;climactic because of the numerous and heavy.
843;handed foreshadowings, to make sure the viewer gets it.
844;Oh, well, maybe my kids will find it cool when they turn 11.
845;There are some worthwhile concepts present, but all are never developed in a good fashion.
846;The build up is as suspenseful as slumber and the delivery is rehash.
847;creativity the entire film is an all out rip.
848;UNDERWORLD has both aforementioned creatures, and still ranks at the botttom of both catagories.
849;This movie is a great addition to any movie collection.
850;"packed, well done, and visually stunning
851;All I can say is WOW!
852;cast/Characters : Beckinsale is a tremendous actress, but not in this role.
853;Give her some Shakespeare and see her true calling.
854;story/Plot : I enjoyed the whole concept of the movie, that the battle has been waged for many years.
855;It's always good to have the bad guys duking it out.
856;Also making everything modern worked well, too.
857;Oh my!F/X : I enjoyed the special effects immensely!
858;The changing of man to werewolf was well done and even the fight scenes (though just a few too many drawn out) were well done.
859;That is what I ended up feeling about this movie.
860;It is good, tut, I however it confronted the judgement where I am better look at that in any case to those.
861;Actually, I must work with respect to the courage which looks at this one.
862;As for me you knew that it is possible.
863;the vampire and the wolf human!
864;And heaven' Because for s, don' T searches the efficiency of the wood from the lead actor with anything.
865;The wolf human of the lead .
866;He just a little was cool.
867;Fill of silver make for wolf human of 2.
868;What a wonderful leap from the normal rules of the genre.
869;This story jumps us right into the middle of a centuries old conflict and weaves it's way back into the past to bring the viewer up to speed.
870;The premise is unique and it works.
871;A refreshing break from the traditional genre that has been overworked to the point of boredom.
872;The twists of politically motivated schemes boil down to the same ole' motivation"
873;This movie is so close to being a new classic that could have built a franchise to rival any available.
874;Kate Beckinsale gives a performance that will convince anyone, like myself, who had doubts about her abilaties to carry a movie and play an antihero/villianess.
875;A must see feature for any fan of the genre.
876;confusion, an enormous overuse of digital grading.
877;strokes, and pays the price accordingly.
878;Her character is essentially her leather outfit, cute bob haircut, and twin firepower skills .
879;welcome dollop of humor to this bleak affair, while 'Kraven' tries to do the same and his howlingly.
880;i always give credit where credit is due: the film looks marvelous given its relatively measly budget of $23 million, and several of the core concepts were initially promising.
881;This movie is mostly an effects and popcorn driven thriller , much like van helsing, only it tries to be serious.
882;it's got a good solid premise, a war between supernaturals, which could be far more interesting than most movies where one supernatural wins out, but it never goes anywhere with it.
883;i give it two stars out of generosity.
884;it's got a nicely dark, moody and gothic atmosphere and sets, good for setting mood.
885;"it is still a very ""Sweet"" movie."
886;Nothing here is going to illuminate the human condition or discuss any sort of heavy philosophy that much of good science fiction is renowned for.
887;It will be interesting to see if an audience develops for this film.
888;If it had just a little more going for it then we might feel more confident about it achieving a kind of cult status.
889;wHO SHOULD WATCH:For those of you looking for more excitement and less deep thought, Underworld is a fine, fine choice.
890;This is a movie of real worth that delivers given the limitations of the super.
891;It feels much more like The Crow than anything else and people who enjoyed that film we feel will like this a great deal as well.
892;This is the sort of movie that improves with a couple of beers to urge along the suspension of disbelief and allow for that immersive joy that some action movies are able to deliver.
893;There is a certain formality and decadence to the culture that reminds one of decaying Rome, which is a strong selling point to the overall plot and should've been explored more, but that is the only similarity to those pulp.
894;Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this.
895;It has a great DTS soundtrack (wow, now can really appreciate the mind.
896;And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super.
897;Will give it 4 because of the thrills
898;"Underworld (Full Screen Special Edition)Arrived ahead of time
899;On the other hand, the story and the acting are more than adequate, and that means more to me.
900;It is exciting all the way through.
901;The plot is intriguing yet somewhat predictable.
902;It's pretty hard to care for any of the characters in this film.
903;There is something in it for everyone: science, revenge, mystery, thrill, horror and of course love.
904;The 3 stars are for a great story that could have been acted better.
905;It's also a much better film overall.
906;The storyline is much more intriguing and the characters have much more depth.
907;This is a great movie, and it was shipped to me fast.
908;Excellent Job, and Thank you.
909;It was refreshing and a twist in the plot had me going.
910;underworld has a story line to it, unlike Matrix Reloaded (which I still enjoyed, BTW).
911;In many respects, it reminded me of The Crow and the first two Batman movies, giving a Gothic feel to it, which sets the tone for the movie.
912;For me, that is such an integral part of the Vampire lore, but I can overlook it in this case.
913;It's actually ingenious with the types of ammo they came up with for this movie.
914;Better to use the technology at hand I say to give yourself an advantage.
915;Characters reflected in other character's sunglasses04.
916;The extended cut really expanded on this.
917;It's the best thing to happen to Vampires since, well, immortality.
918;the StoryThey actually did a nice job of trying to keep it fairly believable.
919;I have to give credit here.
920;There is a vulnerability and a sense of things going on behind the eyes with Trinity that makes her an intriguing character rather than the mindless video.
921;Michael Sheen as the lycan leader and Shane Brolly as the vampire leader were very good.
922;Underworld to me was a great horror movie with lots of potential for more movies.
923;I can honestly say I am a major fan of these movies and hope they can make more of these movies.
924;I enjoy watching all things with these movie and wasn't disappionted.
925;So if your looking for some good vampire wearwolves movie then pick this movie up and enjoy some good blood gore and much more from both sides of the fighting.
926;Beckinsale as the assassin Seline is the most human of the groups, and her conscience leads her to some startling discoveries as she attempts to save Michael Corvin (Speedman) from both the vampires and the lycans.
927;The ending has a satisfying conclusion, while leaving us with a tease that there will be a sequel.
928;it was great to watch this movie in the theatre.
929;ultraviolet bullets and silver shurikins.
930;This one tells more of the story and is just well made.
931;My favorite vampire hero of all time.
932;Selena is so awesome that I even decided to name my daughter after her if it's a girl
933;Apart from the comic trip look and feel of this film, apart from the special effects both on the side of the vampires and on the side of the werewolves, apart from the impossible love affair between a vampire girl and a werewolf boy, at the beginning qt least, soon to become something else, this film is decadent in all possible ways and somewhere kind of paranoid.
934;And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple.
935;and underworld is a very good example of the genre.
936;As I have seen the movie twice there are lots of little details that made the movie even more enjoyable the second time.
937;There maybe more love interest in the sequel.
938;There is definatly enough depth to this world and enough loose threads to make it worthwhile.
939;Go see the movie but don't expect epic romance expect a heroine who's world is about to turn upsidedown
940;the movie is good popcorn entertainment.
941;It was nice to see the beginning of the Underworld series.
942;I saw this after watching Rise of The Lycans, and the movie made a lot more sense after seeing the first Underworld.
943;The visuals in the movie were pretty good for a nearly 10 year old movie, good sound too.
944;I thought I would not like it, but in fact I loved it.
945;Action scenes are pretty good as well (enter the Matrix).
946;it was a sleeper hit last October and it continues to draw crowds of viewers.
947;I particularly liked the documentary called Fangs or Fiction which touches on the history of Vampire, Werewolf Myths and Legends and even has an interview with a real Werewolf as well as two real Vampires.
948;I give it 5 stars, and look for a sequel or even a prequel in the next year or so.
949;Underworld is a fine example of such a film.
950;Kate Beckinsale's character Selene moves in such a way as to guarantee that her full length leather coat will billow and swing perfectly.
951;Her hair dangles in her face in a perfectly planned but seemingly accidental fashion.
952;He has an amazing intensity and an elegant speaking voice.
953;Whereas you might expect the leader of a pack of animals to be rough and barbaric, Sheen's Lucian is steady, controlled, and often soft spoken.
954;this is a very enjoyable film with a fairly original premise.
955;Filled with action, great effects, good story line, and fast paced, """"Underworld"""" put a stake right through my heart!"""
956;"Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, ""Lucian,"" feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans."
957;ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.
958;A centuries old war waged between vampire and Lycan has boiled to epic proportions, and only modern technology will determine the champion.
959;packed thrill ride with wrenching plot twists that will blow away your understanding of the genre.
960;science and ancient legends collide, turning full circle the vampire's story.
961;I really wanted to like this movie, a lot.
962;"First, it has Kate Beckinsale, who I have loved and followed ever since she appeared in ""Cold Comfort Farm"" (hopefully my wife understands)."
963;She's pretty, personable, and, in this film, very sexy looking.
964;Her curiosity causes her to come into conflict with the present leaders of the vampires and to, naturally, meet and fall in love with Speedman.
965;the film is beautifully shot in a blue tint, but for some reason, its almost constantly raining throughout the film.
966;Speedman appears to be a med student and works at a hosptial with other Americans.
967;But that's exactly how I felt while watching this movie.
968;still, the film is worth viewing for the excellent cinematography and Kate Beckinsale.
969;This is an absolutely incredible film.
970;This movie delivers with the action around every corner.
971;Kate Beckinsale does a phenomenal job in this film.
972;I would recommend that anyone and everyone give this movie the chance it deserves.
973;And at least Glitter was good for a few laughs.
974;I really enjoy horror movies (The Howling, Evil Dead, etc), and I enjoy a good bit of entertaining action (Blade), but this movie was neither scary nor entertaining.
975;The special effects are great, and in response to another reviewer who said they were bad, they are awsome.
976;If you view this with a home theatre system you will be reaping some serious rewards.
977;And by the way, the acting is very well done.
978;i won't go into the whole story in detail (because it's obviously been covered in other reviews), but I found it a very good adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.
979;Throw in some intrigue, some betrayal, good special effects and great action, and you have a really great movie.
980;ray]This first installment of the series is still the most fully realized film of the bunch, although there are some nice sfx in the sequel as well.
981;The establishment of the world of Underworld is well executed, and it's always a joy to watch Bill Nighy do almost anything (don't miss his incredible turn in The Girl in the Cafe), and Kate Beckinsale is never better.
982;The series is due for another installment to wrap it up.
983;When u first see it predict whos goin to win Vampires or werewolves.
984;This movie is absolutlly great from the opening scene to the end, full of action and sci.
985;To start the gunplay is good but the sound puts it over the top every time a bullet would go off you would here that thump in your speakers alot like a real gunshot other movies (most) have been unable to produce a good bass effect with gunfire this one does it great.
986;Instead of using stealth, cunning, and teeth they fight with lots and lots of guns.
987;"In addition to being immortal and having superhuman strength, the werewolves (called ""lycans"" in the film, short for lycanthropes) have the ability to change their form regardless of whether or not the moon is full."
988;lots and lots of guns (in human form).
989;so basically UNDERWORLD takes a really cool concept, removes everything cool about it, and gives us a standard issue post.
990;Other than that this film earns a big SO WHAT?
991;The film is stylish and highly entertaining.
992;Kate Beckinsale gave a stellar performance in this movie.
993;besides many included extra, this Blu.
994;Wiseman very capably directed this film, based on a good script with some intriguing twists on the legends of vampires and werewolves.
995;Seeing the Widescreen really made it more impressive than a first viewing on satellite TV.
996;the plot moves quickly and tells a old story with some really enjoyable and intriguing twists on vampires and werewolves.
997;The story is suspensful, as you work to figure out who is good and bad, but the twists are also logical which makes them all the more fun.
998;Overall, I thought this was a good blend of action, horror and suspense.
999;My wife and I have shown it several times to friends, and we enjoy it more and see more details each time we see it.
1000;We really hope that a sequel does appear, because this movie was a lot of fun.
1001;done action or horror movies, but want a thoughtful plot and good acting, you should enjoy this combination of good actors and direction, with crisp editing to keep the story rolling and you on the edge of your seats.
1002;It is all about look and style and fashion and precious little about story and plot/character development.
1003;Blue filtered, gothic high fashion, high octane fun.
1004;Lots of Kate Beckansale, debatable the most underrated actress of her generation, at least in the colonies, doing her shoot em up ultra cool girl vampire thing.
1005;It was entertaining, stylish and fun.
1006;I for one am glad to see a well crafted bit of Saturday afternoon hokum played out so well.
1007;for those who enjoy the role playing genre of horror games you will unmistakable note similarites between this movie and White Wolf studios games like Vampire: the Masquerade Werewolf: the Apocalypse.
1008;I owned the first edition of this movie, but this one kick it all the way.
1009;superb, excellent use of full and clear surround soundextras.
1010;First off, Underworld is a four star movie.
1011;it was longer, I noticed that.
1012;but the package is way cool.
1013;It's just an elaborate promo for the movie.
1014;I hope they have a really good explaination on the commentary track.
1015;It looked interesting, lots of action, maybe some romance.
1016;Like the story or not there is no denying that this is a beautiful film to look.
1017;The overtones and the cinematography make watching the film like looking at gothic art.
1018;Kate Beckinsale is great in this movie.
1019;This movie came to mme in perfect condition and arrived 2 days early.
1020;this completed my set and its just fun to have a underworld movie night.
1021;Underworld was a suprisingly good movie.
1022;All Four of the Underworld flicks are awesome, action packed, and a great story line, even the way it was shot is pretty cool, sort of a surrealism
1023;I loved when he cracked that scientist' skull because.
1024;So I liked it for that, and I liked that it was sorta short and way gothy.
1025;She was so excited as she had wanted it for a long time.
1026;The incredible storyline of intertwining Vampires and Werewolfs is incredibly well done.
1027;This movie was beautifully shot in a dark tone with a gothic city as its backdrop.
1028;I have watched it about 4 times now and everytime I pick up something new.
1029;realistic, and way over used in movies.
1030;Using real people as the creatures make them that much scarier.
1031;Underworld was a surprising and refreshing break from all the romantic, too.
1032;sweet vampire movies out there.
1033;world backgrounds, this movie was a pleasant change from the vampy norm.
1034;I have to say this is one of my all time favorite movies and series.
1035;If you love vampires or werewolves this one has them both in spades!
1036;Add a ton of action and yes romance thrown into the mix and you have Underworld.
1037;Both have major strategic strong points and weaknesses the werewolves are strong and viral, the vampires are equally strong and with increasing weaponry tech seem to be slowly gaining the upper hand on the werewolves.
1038;This truly is one that is both thrilling, romantic, and just an all around great action packed fun ride.
1039;I loved it from the first time I saw it, and it remains one of my all time favorites that I find myself re.
1040;if you haven't seen this one yet I highly recommend it!
1041;I'm a fan of sy.
1042;fy, so this fits into my likes.
1043;It's one of those movies I'll watch again and again.
1044;At least this movie looks great.
1045;It moves fast and sometimes it's hard to follow but for about 2 hours, it's worth the look.
1046;She's just like some edgy, model.
1047;The hero is a real babe!
1048;I love all the underworld movies but this one is by far my favorite.
1049;The action is fantastic and the story line is addictive.
1050;Super cool special effects a la Matrix.
1051;style and an interesting story line make this one of the better movies I've added to my collection.
1052;the story line is an interesting twist of the family feud genre.
1053;The story is compelling enough to hold up under the over.
1054;style effects are cool, they are becoming generally overdone in Hollywood as a whole.
1055;action/slow motion and more kick.
1056;It's hard for Hollywood to get the look of a werewolf right, so these guys were actually farily good compared to some.
1057;overall, the film was a fun ride and I look forward to the next installment.
1058;the main word that sprang to mind after seeing it was.
1059;The trailer, surely one of the most enticing for a long time, remains a vision of what this film could have been .
1060;I have never seen anything so sold as having a major romantic element, and so absolutely shying away from the subject.
1061;still, there's fun to be had in spotting the movies that director Len Wiseman liked in the past few years.
1062;Kinda cute, in a way.
1063;Jumping off tall buildings gracefully and firing guns are pretty much all their talents, but the Lycans get to do all that and way, way more.
1064;Great actor, the only character with any depth, and a joy to watch.
1065;"It's damn good to look at most of the time (it may help if you turn your brain off during most of the plot exposition
1066;Entertaining take on the vampire mythology.
1067;This movie is one of the ultimate in fantasy movies.
1068;The story of the vampires, lycans, and human sides of the war is an interesting plot.
1069;I love how the story brings together each world vividly and how the war effects them.
1070;Had seen this movie years ago, have seen all four movies and by far this one is the best with evolution being second.
1071;This is not the sort of film you should try to analyse but just go with the flow and you are bound to enjoy this excellent Blue.
1072;Underworld is a great looking movie that has a similar look and feel to it as films like the Matrix and the Crow.
1073;Still though Kate Beckinsale surprisingly is in strong heroine form and it's impressive since she's been in basically only romance movies before this.
1074;Anyway I always wanted to see a vampires vs werewolves movie and we get that with Underworld.
1075;Yes they shoot at each other but I'd rather see more of them actually fighting.
1076;It's still pretty cool though.
1077;Underworld is a fun movie that you'll enjoy more if you just sit back and let the action wash over you.
1078;Very sleek stylized action with a very beautiful female lead.
1079;Kate Beckinsale definitely enters the role of Selene like a perfect fit.
1080;I have to admit, the film seemed to have a relatively solid plot.
1081;Finally a vampire movie with an intriguing story to tell.
1082;The idea of vamps fighting werewolves was a fresh and especially interesting concept.
1083;This is definitely a good one to own, and I can't wait until the sequel comes out.
1084;Is there anything else worth mentioning.
1085;All three are the very best there is in this genre.
1086;The movie is more style than substance, and while style is good, it can also ruin a movie if you don't have anything to back it up.
1087;Kate Beckinsale and company do their best with what is giving but even their best efforts can't hide the fact that the story feels like it was written on the fly, and rush into production with out a good rewrite to help punch up the script.
1088;fi, action, fighting and/or vampire type movies, this is a great movie to add to your collection.
1089;I bought them both at the same time and think they are great movies.
1090;This is definately one of the best actiton movies to come out in a LONG time.
1091;The special effects are amazing, and the acting is great.
1092;The little details are so perfect, and the story is Awesome.
1093;Anyway, this movie rocks, and you should check it out!
1094;The movies are well made and very enjoyable.
1095;My son and myself really enjoyed watching this movie.
1096;Although the real plot is more complicated than that, thats it in a nutshell.
1097;I really thought the storyline was interesting all the way through, and the acting was pretty good.
1098;If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level.
1099;I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.
1100;It wants to be the Next Great Vampire/Werewolf Movie.
1101;what it _is_ is a pretty good (and fairly novel) film in the gothic.
1102;But that's all it is.
1103;the idea here is a perfectly good one.
1104;the whole thing is fairly well handled (including the special effects), and it's at least fun to watch even if the characters are rather one.
1105;guns goth wetdream, this is a good choice.
1106;The look is excellent and the production values are high, but it's mostly surface gloss: there is, let's say, a high style.
1107;engrossing, interesting, and alot of fun to watch.
1108;thrusting the viewer into the midst of a centuries.
1109;rich with gothic lore and posessing enough twists to keep you interested, Underworld is well.
1110;worth the price of admission.
1111;I saw the trailer for Underworld in the beginning of the summer and marked my calendar to see it the day it opened.
1112;I enjoyed the trailer so much that I downloaded the 33M full screen version from the Underworld web site.
1113;I was surprised how much of a story was included.
1114;I hope the movie does well so the studio feels a sequel is a good investment.
1115;I definitely recommend this movie!
1116;Kate, please come home to England and British film.
1117;in other words, the things that make a film look good.
1118;Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*!
1119;The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires.
1120;all of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film"
1121;And there will be a sequel.
1122;the hybrid concept was terrific .
1123;For that reason alone I'll see the sequel.
1124;I won't give anything away, but you should really see this movie.
1125;The fact that they run around with guns may seem hokey at first, but once you see the whole story you'll appreciate it a lot more.
1126;well written, well paced, good plots lines and character development.
1127;lots of classic themes from Romeo and Juliet to Hamlet.
1128;werewolf vs Vampire is an homage to all the vs movies and they pull the two together with decent plausibility.
1129;underworld is'nt terrible,but it's is'nt mind blowing fantastic either.
1130;they try hard at trying hard,and the effects are good enough to pull it off,and the underlying story pulls through in the end.
1131;One of the best new movies in quite a while.
1132;This film takes a new angle on the world of vampires and werewolves.
1133;But stick with it and watch it a second time if you must.
1134;While it's an action film at its heart, there is enough thought put into this to be intelligent.
1135;really worth the time to see it at least once.
1136;My wife and I both loved it and enjoyed the sequel (which features one of the hottest love scenes ever).
1137;Things really heat up when one of the vampire elders is awakened and has to deal with the changing situations.
1138;But this is an action.
1139;With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.
1140;Ok, so I've just finished watching Underworld and I have to say, I love it!
1141;as for the movie, a brilliant combination of storyline, not too much special effects, and a brilliant set layout.
1142;This movie is a pretty interesting, fast paced action ride about vampires fighting werewolves.
1143;Also, the gothic air in this movie is very entertaining, as it supports the whole vampire theme.
1144;It walks on the fringes but overall it's a good movie.
1145;In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun.
1146;Underworld drops you into this story without so much as a compass to guide you.
1147;are drastically modified, which is fine it itself.
1148;Her motivation for hunting the Lycans (and please note the spelling kids .
1149;the movie partially redeems itself with the finale, which is clever and sometimes even original.
1150;bottom line: As a B. grade monster/action flick, it's actually pretty good.
1151;Its one of my favorite movies in the entire world and I bought it immediately when it was released many months ago.
1152;I am disappointed but its a great movie.
1153;Vampires versus Werewolves is an intriguing concept.
1154;And the movie has plenty of style.
1155;The movie Underworld was a good movie, granted not the gothic Blade meets Romeo and Juliet that it was billed to be, but it had solid action, a decent story and great effects.
1156;This movie really looks great on Blu.
1157;ray with an AVC encode and the PCM lossless audio is excellent.
1158;First of all, this movie made the vampires suck.
1159;I know that werewolves are strong and everything but dam!
1160;The vampires in this movie aint worth shiat so he didnt get much power from them.
1161;And whats up with vampires and werewolves using weapons.
1162;points about this movie that the story line sucked.
1163;I like vampire movies and this is very good with the plot twists.
1164;I enjoy movies that have a lot of intrigue in them.
1165;"long into the fray with 2003's surprise hit ""Underworld""."
1166;Now, we are presented with vampires decked out in sleek, leather outfits, packing modern.
1167;day weaponry and martial arts influenced fighting styles.
1168;One thing is for sure, these are supernatural beings and monsters for the new, post.
1169;For the most part the story does a terrific job in balancing the plot with the action, interspersed with brief tidbits of the history between the two races.
1170;that being said, in the end those moments are overshadowed by the fact that Danny McBride did an excellent job of crafting a story that introduced us to a complicated war between supernatural beings.
1171;"While the director, Len Wiseman (""Live Free or Die Hard"") skillfully guided the story to cinematic life complete with style, an eerie atmosphere that blended the familiar with the supernatural, and a terrifically cast group of actors and actresses."
1172;also, seeing a female vampire doing a majority of the action was an interesting change of pace for this type of film, but a welcome one at that.
1173;Kate handled herself in the action sequences in such a strong, confident manner that she quickly solidified her character as one not to be messed with.
1174;"actor Scott Speedman (""Dark Blue"") was good in the role of Michael, the human that the lycans are focused upon."
1175;Even so, acting wise I don't believe he is up to par with some of the other, more accomplished cast members.
1176;of course, the fact that a vampire/werewolf movie actually has acting that was good enough to set standards for the entire cast is surprising in itself (at least in my estimation).
1177;This film's cast actually seemed to take pride in getting their characters right and making them interesting to the audience, while still holding true to the archetypes being portrayed.
1178;His layered performance elevated the character of Viktor from being just another one.
1179;dimensional despot to a complicated being that was very real despite his supernatural disposition.
1180;"His performance was laced with such subtle malevolence, so that whenever his character would snap and unleash the inner beast it was almost startling
1181;with such generally strong performances, fast.
1182;paced action and stunts, and solid storytelling, """"Underworld"""" is without a doubt an excellent monster movie in every sense."""
1183;The film successfully brings a centuries.
1184;old war between supernatural beings to life in a way that is interesting and above all, entertaining.
1185;But I've seen this movie several times by now, and it always holds my interest.
1186;Looks good, plenty of action, only a few small areas where the story lags, but overall a fun movie you can rewatch again and again when you need an adrenaline injection and something otherworldly and fun.
1187;It was a great concept and story to begin with.
1188;I really liked the movie.
1189;Now, the werewolves may have an edge as they discovered a way to combine the genes of both species to create a half.
1190;The action sequences were amazing.
1191;The reviews I've read both pro and casual pretty much sum up my thoughts, this is a very good transfer in both image and sound.
1192;Instead it's a world of darks and grey with a touch of gothic appeal.
1193;And this is where this movie shines above all others.
1194;It has a great blend with surprising detail in this contrast especially with Kate Beckinsale dressed in black leather, with pitch black hair and a pale skin face.
1195;"But it's all thruout the movie from the buildings, stone, chains, the rainy weather
1196;I was really surprised how well the DD 5.1 track did on this.
1197;Most will say, """"oh well it's a gun battle here and there and what do you expect""""."""
1198;Sound wise a excellent choice for those who enjoy action and want it loud.
1199;I love good Vampire or Werewolf type movies and Underworld fits the bill nicely.
1200;"The movie is solid for what it is
1201;Kate Beckinsale does awesome and in the movie.
1202;Loking forward to watch the rest of the movies in the series.
1203;packed from the get go"
1204;speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.
1205;"The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it
1206;The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene.
1207;The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.
1208;And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous: gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin.
1209;even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.
1210;It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.
1211;so, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?
1212;And something bigger and badder than both.
1213;Hey, this is eye candy, pure dark fiction.
1214;A few reviewers were dissing it so far, but I happened to enjoy it.
1215;also the lycans (werewolves) looked really cool, big raw cats, and the transformatin you got to watch was really some oscar worty special effects.
1216;I love the stylish production.
1217;When Selene, the female vampire of a coven somewhere near 1700 years old, finds a human and realizes the vampire's arch nemesis, Lucian is alive when she had been told all of her life he was dead (the rules are strict about delving into the past in Selene's world) she very much wants to know what the Lycans want from him.
1218;I am a great fan of Kate Beckinsale and I think she plays a brilliant part in a sometimes complex, but well directed movie.
1219;The story, as I said is not just brilliant, but there is a beautiful love story between Lucian and his vampire wife, Sofia.
1220;These movies are the story of the development of both races and the thrill of living a little bit inside their cruel, dark worlds.
1221;But the powerful love story was simply done brilliantly and it is my second favorite in the series.
1222;This is true """"adult"""" entertainment."""
1223;All movies send you on a fantastic thrill ride as the twists and turns just keep coming.
1224;There have been countless movies about vampires and/or werewolves but this manages to offer a fresh take and not just rehash old stories.
1225;the star of the movie is Kate Beckinsale and she is just great in the lead role.
1226;"Having seen her before in romantic comedy type parts (""Serendipity""), it's a pleasant surprise that she (and her stunt people) are so good in a straight action part."
1227;Fans of action movies will enjoy this movie.
1228;There are some extended scenes in this version.
1229;Great Movie, great effects, Kate Beckinsale!
1230;If you like these three thing, you must see both.
1231;It's a great movie filled with action and suspense.
1232;It is filled with vampires and lichens.
1233;She enjoys her job until she meets Michael, a human recently turned into a Lycan.
1234;michael is a human hunted by the Lycans for his unique DNA.
1235;Selene uncovers a possible betrayal of the coven when she discovers that Lucian is very much alive.
1236;Lies, betrayal and forbidden love all come to an explosive finale.
1237;i really enjoyed this movie because I thought the story was good, creating an intriguing myth for the relationship between Vampires and Lycans.
1238;Underworld moved along at a fast pace, keeping the viewer interested.
1239;The look and feel of the movie was dark and gloomy, which fit perfectly with the story.
1240;developed characters dominate the screen, breathing life into ancient mythic creatures.
1241;What I also liked about her character is that her hair was messed from the rain and all the fighting she was doing, which is realistic.
1242;I would have loved to see more romance develop between Selene and Michael.
1243;I highly recommend this movie to fans of dark fantasy and vampire and werewolf lore.
1244;Maybe it's the exquisite hedonism.
1245;Maybe it's just the beautiful makeup effects.
1246;I thought this movie was awesome, great special effects and if you love vampires and werewolfs then youll love this movie, with action packed battles of the two breeds.
1247;This movie has great action, acting, killer stunts, special effects, and a kick ass soundtrack.
1248;This is her finest acting yet.
1249;This is one of my favorite movies of the year.
1250;One star for the always sexy hot/good looking Kate Beckinsale is all I can say about this movie, and I mean.
1251;spectacular feast for the eyes found here either, I can also say that perhaps the 'other' good thing about this movie is that the acting is just ever so BARELY above average.
1252;Lucian is discovering how to create a hybrid werewolf/vampire.
1253;this is an excellent movie.
1254;In a world full of half baked horror/action movies, underworld shines brightly.
1255;A great cast, story, and awesome intensity shoot this film to the top of it's respective genre.
1256;Underworld is the first vampire film that really caught my attention.
1257;i loved the roles played by Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman as Selene and Michael.
1258;this film is a must.
1259;see for all horror film fanatics.
1260;Underworld is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci.
1261;Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.
1262;"The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from ""Fight Club"" in the city's subway tunnels."
1263;It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.
1264;Performances and camera angles are superb.
1265;ROL IS perhaps the best story in the series.
1266;I found the movie watchable especially for the special effects and the costuming.
1267;For example, it was quite cool when the elder vampire gradually became more human looking as the blood regenerated.
1268;If you're expecting a great storyline or surprising twists, you'll be disappointed, but vampire and lycanthropy efficiandos will enjoy the film.
1269;Nobody really does a vampire movie these days with a well written plot and good acting until now.
1270;It had good twists and people who enjoy vampire and werewolf fiction will enjoy this film.
1271;over all the plot was good, the creatures, so.
1272;It's a good movie, though a little cheesy in some spots for me.
1273;I honestly prefer the second movie to this one.
1274;, she is a much better female hero of the movie than say, Angelina Jolie runnning around in the Tomb Raider movies.
1275;the effect as far as the battle between vampires and werewolves was excellent.
1276;be sure to watch the bonus features to see the making of the werewolves.
1277;and the plot unwinds at a good pace, actually making you wait until the end to have it all reveal itself to you as you're caught up in all the action, horror, and fast paced scenes.
1278;It's the best movie I've seen in a long time.
1279;But I have to admit, I loved this movie.
1280;I loved the dark world setting, the powerful music, the movie's pacing, and the plot twists at the end.
1281;The bullets of silver nitrate and sunlight were.
1282;I thought Seline as the conflicted werewolf hunter was very believable.
1283;The funny outtakes, featurettes and comic book are worth adding to your collection.
1284;Great plot, characters, special effects, weapons, action.
1285;Very addictive movie that you can watch repeatedly.
1286;Watch the other movies, too.
1287;All the vamps look good in leather and they always live in a castle, classy!
1288;It has good moments, cool gadgets and a sequel with better looking were.
1289;Fun movie with a unique plot.
1290;Not sure about the others in the franchise but this is a decent way to pass some time.
1291;I'm a big fan of this movie, and the extras that come with this version are nice, but I wish I had of chosen the theatrical release.
1292;The extra footage that you'll find in this version is quite good, and does a better job of explaining some of the plot points and character motivations, and I did enjoy having the director and both main characters doing the commentary BUT the footage that was cut was cut for pacing reasons and as a result this version tends to drag on.
1293;let's hope that the sequel will have a bit more thought.
1294;Underworld is an ambitious movie, but to appreciate it one needs to understand that it is the first installment in a trilogy.
1295;Also, and this is important, Underworld tells a story.
1296;I suspect that this will be a better story when all three parts of the trilogy are filmed and can be viewed in one sitting.
1297;barred battle between Lycans and vampires, waged sometimes with stylish modern weaponry, sometimes with tooth and claw.
1298;"dealers, give us a glimpse into the Lycan culture
1299;it succeeds in several interesting ways.
1300;It is, though, very satisfying from a storytelling and character perspective.
1301;It enhances Underworld's replay value, makes a second or third watching of the movie more interesting because characters we know from the first hour are more fully developed by the end of the film, and more interesting for it.
1302;Underworld is several stories: a love story, yes, but more than that it is several characters' efforts to resolve an ancient conflict between Lycans and vampires, each in their own way.
1303;By the end of the film, Underworld has given us a glimpse into the true nature of the conflict and the true character of its principals.
1304;in sum, what weakens the first film is what may make the trilogy interesting.
1305;final note: Casting was quite good with each character (Beckinsale's Selene, Speedman's Michael, Viktor, Lucian, et.
1306;al.) delivering a performance that matched their character nicely.
1307;Special effects were also quite good.
1308;Underworld is an outstanding, sleek action thriller with extremely dark undertones that I highly enjoyed watching.
1309;Outside of that minor detractor, this films scores on all points, from the overall dark atmosphere to the story telling and to the acting.
1310;while I've seen and read that the professional critics and many others have pretty much panned this movie, if you've not seen it yet, I urge you to give it an open minded try as I believe you will be as surprised by it as I was!
1311;As far as stories go that involve vampires and werewolves, """"Underworld"""" takes a completely new, intriguing and compelling approach that will hopefully spawn a sequel."""
1312;Her performance as the lead in an action film of this magnitude is, to say the least, incredible.
1313;She is an extremely gorgeous woman and given the makeup and costumes she's wearing in this film, they only serve to greater enhance her beauty.
1314;Her future performances are definitely to be looked forward to with anticipation.
1315;i highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films from this particular genre.
1316;This new spin on the Vampires and Werewolves mythology and Kate Beckinsale's performance makes this film an instant classic in the genre!
1317;"music Video: Finch: ""Worms of the Earth""."
1318;"bonus Trailers (Within these bonus trailers it's wonderful to see that we will be treated to ""Resident Evil 2"" sometime during this coming year!)"
1319;Seeing the trailer many times before the movie came out, it looked like one of the strongest movies in atmosphere in past couple of years.
1320;The vampire vs. lycan story and entertaining and there is rarely a slow area in this action packed film.
1321;I found it interesting how they have a hybrid of the two races.
1322;The background story while explained some in this film is more detailed in the next film.
1323;For anyone who loves watching vampire movies, this one is awesome.
1324;Combining a story about vampires and lycans (werewolves) was a great idea.
1325;This one has a lot of familiar looks and action.
1326;it could have had a little more original style and costumes, but it was still a good movie.
1327;Guns, kicks, cars, phones, gizmos, leather outfits.
1328;in terms of pure ability, the werewolves definitely outclass the supposedly superior vampires.
1329;maybe the reason other people that wrote reviews for this movie enjoyed it more than me was because they were capable of making sense of about 1/8 of it which is more than i could say for myself.
1330;Kate Beckinsale played her role of Selene with mesmerizing and witty balance.
1331;Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin did an excellent job as well.You have to pay close attention to what's going on.
1332;The end wraps up very nicely with no flaws (that I saw anyway).
1333;Music video director Len Wiseman made a great film debut.
1334;A huge dissapointment from a very promising concept.
1335;The movie is well done with entertaining special effects, and the plot is fairly creative.
1336;I did enjoy Kate Beckinsale's portrayl of a dark action hero.
1337;I would give this movie 10 stars if I was allowed, this is my favorite movie!
1338;The lead character is selene, a strong, smart and sexy vampire, she is one of the best female characters I have seen in years.
1339;i love the characters, the mystery, and the cultures created around these two enemy races.
1340;The sequel wasn't quite as good, but was still enjoyable.
1341;It is definitely a cross between Blade and the Matrix.
1342;Great costumes, cinematography, action and special effects were wonderful.
1343;It was a good idea to have vampires and werewolves going at it.
1344;The casting was also good, but would have preferred Bruce Payne playing the part of Victor.
1345;The ending leaves it open for a sequel and I certainly can't wait for part II.
1346;It really makes you think.
1347;So muckh better than Van Helstink!
1348;If that title makes you think you know what to expect from this movie, you should actually watch this movie before passing judgement.
1349;I saw the preview and thought it looked interested, so when time came for it to be released, I found myself at the AMC 24 checking it out.
1350;Underworld was more than a pleasant surprise, and in turn became one of my favorite movies of 2004.
1351;If you're into action, love stories, vampires, werewolves, or all of the above, then this movie was made for you to enjoy.
1352;The goal of both the Lycans and the Vampires, is to exterminate the other side.
1353;Start to finish I found the movie very interesting, especially the fight scenes and special effects.
1354;There's plenty for action and horror fans a like to find in this movie, and that's why it's a recommended must see to any of those people.
1355;The Unrated extended cut is the essential version of the movie, as it further develops characters in the movie, and has an extended final fight sequence.
1356;The ending is kind of a cliff.
1357;If you didn't catch it in theatres, then this is a great opportunity to get a great movie.
1358;I highly recommmend it to fans of action or horror.
1359;Definitely if you're a Resident Evil fan this is worthy of checking out.
1360;Kate did an amazing job, and I think this movie is way underrated.
1361;I bought this for my son.
1362;He had the other ones so he wanted this one to go with it.
1363;underworld is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.
1364;, Bill Nighy, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.
1365;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
1366;The acting was pretty good as were the special effects.
1367;Move over, Blade: there's a new girl in town.
1368;Although she is a member of a clan, she doesn't really feels she fits in, and spurns the affections of the young and handsome next would.
1369;Supercool, with great acting, gorgeous sets, and KB in a skintight leather suit with kool boots, Underworld is a classic that I am proud to own.
1370;That is what I liked most about it.
1371;Theres action, a catchy story, awesome actors, cool effects, and just the perfect movie.
1372;I'm a fan of a lot vampire movies like queen of the damned blade 1 2 dusk till dawn and a whole lot more.
1373;The effects in here make you feel like you are in the movie.
1374;Tight leather outfits, gothic look, lots of automatic weapons and just enough vampire lore to make it all fit.
1375;The look of the movie, the costumes, the sets, the special effects are fabulous, but the acting and the STORY is what makes this movie special.
1376;if you can get by the few ridiculous moments then you should be fine with this.
1377;If you can manage to suspend your disbelief this movie is quite a treat.
1378;underworld has some nice fight scenes and made full use of special effects for its time.
1379;The story is well thought out.
1380;Although so much of the world has to be explained as well it is amazing the story is as well done as it is.
1381;And in my opinion the acting worked well for the overall movie.
1382;the director added in a lot of sound effects that give the sequences more emotion.
1383;The moody music and loud sounds help gluing you to the screen.
1384;This movie is great if you get pulled into it and laughably bad if you are sitting on the side lines pointing at strange visuals.
1385;Had a good time watching.
1386;UNDERWORLD was a fun and fast.
1387;And that by itself in this day and age, is saying something.
1388;that's a good thing!I think Len Wiseman did a commendable job for a first.
1389;this movie was full of action and eye.
1390;The cinematography and overall look and feel of the movie was awesome.
1391;Sure there could have been a myriad of things done better, but look for that in the sequel!I knew right off that this movie was going to be enjoyable.
1392;The idea alone was a great concept.
1393;I for one will be going to see the next movie and read the next book.
1394;They fun even though they are violent.
1395;The extra footage helped explain a few things and put a little more color into the movie.
1396;There isn't much great acting here, although the scientist guy is sort of a kick and actually Lucian was pretty good in his lead Lycan role.
1397;The female lead is strikingly beautiful and reminds me of Liv Ullman, but she spends almost all of the movie scowling or with some dour expression on her face.
1398;But the stylishly dark film noir cinematography looks great and sets the mood appropriately enough.
1399;like scientist guy doing a great send.
1400;Overall a pretty good movie with some great special effects and enough action to make you forget to eat that stale, over.
1401;salty, overpriced popcorn that they foist on you these days.
1402;Ever since we learned that vampires aren't the slow, lurching beasties of Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee films, it's been a film genre that guarantees some good eye.
1403;wrapped babes, and extremely expensive cars/guns/computers.
1404;so, on the dork front, this movie's a winner.
1405;And Underworld looks very nice most of the time.
1406;Cool stunts, neat effects, decent sets, solid (though cliche) costuming, and all the guns you could ever want.
1407;I have read most of the reviews written about this movie and i would just like to say i think that this movie rules!
1408;it was well filmed and the acting was okay.
1409;the effects were amazing and i think the director did a wonderful job.
1410;as for the script, i found it very interesting.
1411;the topic of the death dealers vs. the lyken was a unique topic.
1412;The cinematography is dark blue.
1413;New bonus features, it boasts.
1414;"I am not the biggest ""Underworld"" fan, either, but what this version had to offer seemed intriguing."
1415;"pleasure in the vein of ""Ghosts of Mars""."
1416;"Those fans of ""The Crow"" will undoubtedly love this cooler."
1417;And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.
1418;Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up.
1419;And everyone else has to appear sinister.
1420;even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view.
1421;The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel.
1422;So get your popcorn, and watch the movie.
1423;Enjoy the vampire genre, this one has a more detailed and imaginative back story for the characters, I found it very intriguing.
1424;I am a huge fan of monster movies, in particular the vampire and werewolf variety.
1425;Underworld is easily one of my favorites of all time.
1426;Despite a limited budget ($30 mil) and the daunting task of cramming a thousand years of vampire/werewolf history into two hours, Wiseman and company still managed to make it believable and interesting.
1427;Anyway, if you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, monsters, or Kate Beckinsale, I highly recommend this movie to you.
1428;It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.
1429;Stunts and costumes are excellent .
1430;the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects .
1431;in the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human .
1432;in essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.
1433;While the acting is generally competent .
1434;Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders .
1435;'Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast.
1436;paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.
1437;The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.
1438;the extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.
1439;I love this movie it is one of my favorites.
1440;As for the love story part i cant really see much love exept in the extended edition.
1441;But still a great vamp flick
1442;the extended cut has some new added/recut scenes and, although I would've loved for it to be longer, I felt that it did add more dimension to some of the characters.
1443;the new special features are also a big plus.
1444;I enjoyed Fang vs. Fiction and the entertaining commentary by director Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, to name a few.
1445;It's simply the kind of action film that you could watch over and over again.
1446;kate Beckinsale as Selene is simply mesmerizing.
1447;The rest of the cast is also outstanding and the story is completely engrossing.
1448;She is loyal to Viktor, the sleeping leader of her coven.
1449;underworld moves quickly enough that the sheer silliness of the plot doesn't impede the action, and Kate Beckinsale is eye candy enough to make compelling viewing.
1450;If you are into goth and if you liked The Matrix or the Blade movies you will probably like this movie.
1451;Hollywood has clearly run out of ideas and this movie proves it.
1452;Come up with something original!!!!
1453;Star Kate Beckinsale looks very stylish in various tight shiny black outfits and if you had to choose between her Selene or Carrie.
1454;I find Selene a more interesting character.
1455;"There are also some ""super."
1456;The movie looks pretty good and the story, while basically a Vampire.
1457;Vampire and werewolf movies usually come in two flavors: one has great special effects with minimal character development while the other is the reverse.
1458;When Bela Lugosi hammed it up in DRACULA, his rich, Hungarian cadences resonate even today.
1459;In UNDERWORLD, director Len Wiseman presents a milennia long epic struggle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) in what should have been a riveting tale of a blood feud heightened by some truly outstanding special effects.
1460;One can always tell when this balance is out of whack.
1461;If at any time, the viewer has a hard time distinguishing between one set of species and another, then he is pretty sure that the intent of the film is to dazzle the eye rather than engage the mind.
1462;Beckinsale and Speedman are attractive actors who were clearly instructed by the director to vent their inner demons in over the top gravity defying leaps and bounds.
1463;UNDERWORLD promises to be the kind of movie that will initially do well at both the both office and the video market.
1464;The video has a great plot, good script, and good dialogue.
1465;The graphics on the werewolves, good work, but needs more fur.
1466;All because of passion and love, since both are undead creatures, they almost mirrored Romeo and Juliet.
1467;i've seen a few vampire vs warewolf movies in my lifetime and i have never really liked them.
1468;with this movie i got a good look at modern vampires and warevwolves going at it.
1469;This is a unique movie, not in terms of gore and blood,but in terms of the subplot.
1470;absolute power corrupts absolutely .
1471;is spellbinding enough on its own.
1472;"The idea of a vampire falling in love wiht one of the few humans that is left is patronizingly dull, but it works becuase the human is transformed via a wolf bite
1473;this movie deserves a sequel.
1474;By choosing to do so, she will discover a vast conspiracy, the truth about her past, and a forbidden love.
1475;if you are fond of unconventional action movies, and don't think they need to be realistic, you are likely to love this movie.
1476;Not my cup of tea, but my boyfriend loved it.
1477;This is a great film, it makes you want to watch the others.
1478;This is a great film that makes you respect what love can do
1479;The acting is superb, along with the screenwriting, special fx and music.
1480;If you like films like """"The Matrix"""" """"Van Helsing"""" and """"X. men"""" you're going to love this film."""
1481;The character interaction between Michael and Selene is simply beautiful, (and very well conceived.)
1482;Movies are always a good choice as a gift, and this happened to be on my stepdad's list of things he wanted.
1483;He really liked the movie, it was in great condition, but I have yet to watch it.
1484;Man, this woman is simply gorgeous!!!
1485;And gorgeous in a natural, simple way, and not a silicon.
1486;"But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called ""Pearl Harbor"")."
1487;"She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of ""fuel"" (Carrie Ann."
1488;She and her fellow Death Dealers are armed with machine guns that fire silver bullets.
1489;She also discovers a lot more about her own history, the history of vampires and lycans, Lucian's plans, and the leading vampire in which she places the greatest trust, Viktor (Bill Nighy).
1490;though the plot of Underworld is thin, it is unique in its portrayal of the relationship between the two popular mythological creatures of vampires and werewolves.
1491;screen fights, special effects and action are entertaining, and the dark and nearly achromatic cinematography used nearly throughout the film's 121 minutes maintains an infernal atmosphere.
1492;human abilities that the vampires and werewolves have.
1493;overall, I rate Underworld with 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars.
1494;From the film's ending, it is easy to deduce that a sequel may be in the works.
1495;UNDERWORLD is visually impressive, with its dark, dark underworld and the lack of real color in the film.
1496;Lots of flashy special effects and imaginative camerawork.
1497;The movie has no real likeable characters, as if one should like a vampire or werewolf, and there is such disregard for human or other life that it left me feeling vacant and unaffected.
1498;The funniest seen is when a group of vamps is peering into a dark corner trying to see if there is a wolf in their.
1499;arn't they wise and minipulative due to their long lives and experience?
1500;It seems a little far fetched for my taste but the story line is very good.
1501;If you like action, vampires, and werewolves then this movie is for you.
1502;The idea of vampires forming small groups to try and stave off the onslaught of werewolves, who really are more powerful in the World of Darkness (from White Wolf games) is quite traditional.
1503;the movie builds the world of vampires and werewolves very well.
1504;"It shows both the ""beast"" and the human sides of these creatures (the thing that makes it most fascinating I think), so that one can relate to them more as ""real"" characters."
1505;"It is quite nice how the movie shows some science behind vampire and werewolves
1506;It is one of those movies that really engages you and allows you into its world.
1507;It could very well become a classic.
1508;It has a matrix style and story mixed with Interview with a vampire.
1509;suits, you may have found a replacement, or at least a companion for her.
1510;One, I enjoyed the movie.
1511;Gun battles, great special effects, and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.
1512;Being a fan of Whitewolf I enjoyed parts of the movie and can understand why they sued Sony.
1513;Hooked is another good word to describe my reaction to it.
1514;the creators of this film have done a wonderful job of taking the conventional Vampire/Werewolf mythos and twisting it around, taking a fresh new approach.
1515;There are sunlight and silver bullets.
1516;though Len Wiseman and co. have given the theme a scientific twist that is convincing and consistent.
1517;Many may dislike this new direction, but to me, it's a breath of fresh air.
1518;to his credit, director and co. writer Len Wiseman made the decision to go with less CG for the creature and special effects, opting for the tried and true method of using prosthetics, make.
1519;The results are, for one example, werewolves that have a more tactile and real look to them, where computer.
1520;often are never quite convincing enough.
1521;budget film with very high production values.
1522;The sets are great and the whole movie really maintains the dark and gritty feel that its title evokes.
1523;Many others here have already done a fine enough job in their reviews.
1524;I will say the story is another aspect of this film that, for me, elevates it far above being just another supernatural slasher/horror flick .
1525;it's intelligent and is conveyed via well written and delivered dialog.
1526;the casting and acting in Underworld also receives high marks.
1527;For one, Kate Beckinsale (Selene) delivers an absolutely stunning and intoxicating performance.
1528;She's perfect in this role and, by the way, looks incredible.
1529;for their part, the rest of the cast deliver a solid performance as well.
1530;Every actor commands their role skillfully and adequately and I found myself caring about what happens to each one.
1531;if you want to see a slick, stylish and all around well.
1532;done movie, you'd do well to see Underworld.
1533;It was a good story and pretty good cast.
1534;But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star.
1535;the cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience.
1536;Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light.
1537;sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie.
1538;Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops.
1539;Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film.
1540;The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original.
1541;Now it is up to Selene to keep Michael safe from the werewolves so that both Michael and her species can survive.
1542;The best thing about this film, is that it offers the one horror battle that we have always wanted to see .
1543;The reason the film pulls you in, is because both sides have valid reasons to be angry.
1544;The action and special effects in this film are first rate.
1545;outs, and state of the art special effects to make the werewolves look rather terrifying.
1546;Scott Speadman and Kate Beckinsale are especially good as well, and bring the classic Romeo and Juliet element to the film.
1547;They have very good chemistry together.
1548;watching the two groups of classic movie monsters fight it out, really makes Underworld a terrifying thrill ride that will leave you begging for more after the film has ended.
1549;Every element of this film was great, from the outstanding plot and special effects, to the awesome action sequences and the forbidden love between a vampire and a werewolf.
1550;If you are a fan of either action films or horror films, you are sure to enjoy Underworld .
1551;While this movie has an interesting/cool concept and a cool, sexy main character"
1552;I enjoyed watching it though.
1553;Let me explain as best I can.
1554;You see, this movie builds up this ever.
1555;impending fight between the vampires, in particular the ancient vampires, and the werewolves.
1556;I'd love to see all the powers that such a creature would have in it's arsenal.
1557;The head of each group have been at each others throat forever and now the fight is more important than ever.
1558;The lykens are searching for a human that holds the blood that can be used to mix both species to create a very powerful beast.
1559;Thats most of the plot right there.
1560;The rest of the movie looks to be a way to show off special effects and just how many times they can open the double doors with one motion (which is a lot!)
1561;The movie was tottaly Awesome, it was exactly what i have anticipated, the story line was unique, the actors were amazing and took it to another level.
1562;I wont tell you the whole story because it had been already described.
1563;I enjoyed Van Helsing even more than I would've because Kate was so beautiful as Queen of the Gypsies.
1564;onto the positive: The film has an interesting premise though it doesn't really explore any new ground with it.
1565;But there are some cool action sequences, a nice gothic feel, and solid acting.
1566;I don't mind a few dangling plot threads, but this movie pretty much stops in the middle of the story.
1567;I would definitely recommend getting this if you like the movie!
1568;This is absolutely the best Goth movie ever made.
1569;the acting, the sets, the costumes .
1570;is as good as it gets.
1571;Kate Beckinsale kicks ass, and Scott Speedman is just glorious.
1572;Best film since The Crow, light years ahead of Van Helsing (ugh).
1573;I thought Underworld was the best vampire movie ever made.
1574;They picked the perfect cast for this film, especially Kate Beckinsale, she is perfect in these types of films.
1575;The action was top notch with a few good special effects.
1576;The storyline was confusing the first 10 times you watch, but after you watch it about 20 times, the story makes perfect sense and after I got what it was all about, I thought the storyline was great.
1577;I was very impressed with this film and I loved it.
1578;good film to add to my collection.
1579;as a final note if you enjoyed this movie you must see 28 days later, Dog soliders and finaly Brotherhood of the Wolf.
1580;So is everything good you've heard.
1581;listed major problems, there are some genuinely fun moments, to laugh at if nothing else.
1582;I enjoy the esthetics of the show along including the action.
1583;underworld has a lot of suspense in it.
1584;Love between the vampire and lycan species was forbidden by vampire laws.
1585;The vampires feared a blend of the species.
1586;the action scenes in Underworld are stunning.
1587;The part with the most action and over all best graphics would be when the hybrid, Michael changes for the first time and fights the vampire, Viktor.
1588;underworld is a great movie and highly recommended for fans of werewolves and vampires.
1589;The creators of the movie did a great job bringing the fictional characters to life.
1590;They added a few of their own details but managed to stay true to the overall image of the creatures.
1591;Everything was built up perfectly and the movie got better and better as it went along.
1592;There were some intriguing plot twists and it was suspenseful just trying to figure out who the real bad guys were and who the good guys were.
1593;this is the kind of film to watch several times and really get into it which makes it very well worth owning in my opinion.
1594;I am a huge fan of the Vampire and Werewolf genera.
1595;This is a great movie.
1596;I'm not sure it is one of the best movies of this type ever made, but it is VERY good.
1597;it starts out by prefacing the war between the Lycans and Vampires over the centuries and brings you into the modern day world.
1598;There appears to be some hope in combining the blood lines of each species to create a super species, stronger together than each alone.
1599;There is enough action to keep it moving along nicely.
1600;This movie stands on its own and it's well worth the two hours and you'll leave wishing you had either of the powers shown in the movie.
1601;with all joking aside, this movie was done very well.
1602;Len Wiseman did a fantastic job at giving the audience a belivable movie.
1603;If anything else this just gives werewolves a greater edge than what they had before.
1604;First of all I really enjoyed Underworld, and I think that the plot is a good.
1605;There are twists in the plot and an interesting story line.
1606;Also, the performances by the actors/actresses are good.
1607;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the Blade movies, the Crow and Frailty.
1608;The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, which was very cool, including some very nice use of filters creating a dark but polished look.
1609;this movie is the best of vampires YET.
1610;but this one is really cool.
1611;good action, good terror, godd effects.
1612;It was a gift for a very particular friend.
1613;He really liked it and said it was good!
1614;That is a huge endorsement from my friend.
1615;fairly tired subject matter gets a nice boost in this movie.
1616;great show and great special effects.
1617;Underworld is just plain good, utilizing some seriously creative ideas, one of which I have never seen or expected (the idea of mixing a vampire with a werewolf, oh yeah, I felt the love too).
1618;On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use.
1619;A few years ago I caught a late.
1620;"While Underworld doesn't pretend to be anything more than a ""ride"", it's the best movie of this type that I've seen in a while."
1621;It doesn't treat the audience like kids, it has a unique vision well executed, and it has some fine performances (Michael Sheen in particular is a nice find).
1622;The story is an interesting update on the horror archetypes, with emphasis more on action than horror.
1623;(The special bullets are a surprisingly neat idea.)
1624;There are a couple of weak performances on the vampire side, but Beckinsale, Nighy and Sheen are good, and Speedman is okay in a part which doesn't have much depth written into it.
1625;There are a couple of misjudgements in the direction of the performances, but these are small things that most people won't notice, and it's still damned impressive for a first.
1626;The critics hated it, but I loved it.
1627;time director Patrick Tatopoulos did a terrific job (he did FX on the first two movies).
1628;The result was very dark, intense and claustrophobic, but enjoyable because of the production value and the acting.
1629;In particular, it was great to see Nighy and Sheen back and chewing the scenery.
1630;"top (""You have betrayed me."
1631;, and as for Sheen, wow, is that really the same guy who played Tony Blair?
1632;Underworld is a movie about an invisible world within our very midst.
1633;underworld is a visual journey, short on action, shallow in its character development, but otherwise beautiful to look at.
1634;kate's hot, the cinematography was pretty, and we are familiar with enough movies like this that were good, alien 1.3, terminator, matrix, batman, the crow, that it would be easy to say yes i liked.
1635;viruses to make you turn into a giant monster and back again violating conservation of mass and energy both times.
1636;dressed all in black with a black leather trench coat, she's so snazzy!
1637;"The protagonist is Selene, a gorgeous and very athletic female vampire who is a Death Dealer
1638;Along the way, he, and then she, discover the truth about this immortal war, and who has really done what to each other.
1639;The action scenes are a mix of hand.
1640;This is no matter though as the movie is quite entertaining and moves along at a quick pace.
1641;This movie has awesome ambience and action.
1642;time movie that you'll want to watch over and over!
1643;it actually stands on it's merit, with another concept.
1644;Besides that she is confident in the action department, with the token twin handguns on display.
1645;I like the plot of werewolfs feuding with vampires,the twist is good for what it's worth.
1646;at the end of the day order a Pizza and drink a couple of Budweisers and enjoy the show!
1647;the only people who are going to REALLY like this movie are well, people who like movies like this.
1648;thank god for director's cuts.
1649;the inclusion of extra footage and deleted scenes into the original movie has completely changed it.
1650;Not only does it look great, but it made the story great.
1651;The characters have a history that is understandable and interestingly written.
1652;It was a real movie instead of just a stylish goth fantasy.
1653;I'm hopeful about the sequel.
1654;They film the techincal bits in a way that's actually interesting to watch, which can be a challenge.
1655;The Fang vs. Fiction special is a hoot to watch.
1656;One of the best horror films in years.
1657;it has great photography,sets,costumes,special effects,and excellent Marco Beltrami music.
1658;it also has a good script and solid direction that keepthings moving,create a genuinely creepy mood and atmosphere,andreally work up quite a head of suspense.
1659;and the cast is excellent.
1660;derek Jacobi and Bill Nighyare terrific,Scott Speedman is very good,and best of all KateBeckinsale is a knockout!
1661;The movie climatically was wonderful and a good cast of new faces provided a surprising pleasant performance.
1662;A good idea for anyone to see it, as I highly recommend you do, and for those of us who have already.
1663;But I hope it simply raises the bar.
1664;About a day ago, I managed to see """"Underworld"""" at the theater, and this is what I think about the film."""
1665;Underworld has so much action, unrelenting suspense, and mind.
1666;"blowing special effects that make ""Blade"" seem like a walk to grandma's house!"
1667;With intense direction by first.
1668;"time director Len Wiseman, ""Underworld"" has an excellent cast led by the lovely Kate Beckinsale (""Cold Comfort Farm"", ""Pearl Harbor"") in what is sure to be one of the best performances ever in her career."
1669;"She exists solely to slaughter a band of werewolves known as ""Lycans"" that her clan has been battling for centuries."
1670;"in conclusion, ""Underworld"" has it all!"
1671;Great action, a powerful storyline, and a pulsating soundtrack that is sure to please just about anyone looking for a spectacular action film.
1672;"There's a new girl in town, and her name is Kate Beckinsale!"""
1673;this could have been a cool, gothy flick, with fans applauding any shameless MATRIX ripoffs.
1674;The neat thing about the first MATRIX was that you were in on a secret while society.
1675;kate Beckinsale is a fine actress, and works hard to carry this thing, but in the end the overly.
1676;What they do need to do is get a good script team in there.
1677;so, it's vampires versus werewolves in an ultra.
1678;The werewolves were the best part of this film.
1679;, but they also have the ability to change into their wolf form at will.
1680;They also came across like true warriors fighting for their own personal honor.
1681;I also liked the twist surrounding the Lycan leader that sort of balanced both sides.
1682;the Vampires: You know, I kind of laugh when I think about the motives behind the filmakers regarding how they handled the vampires.
1683;In MY opinion, this movies actually TRIES to make fun of vampires and the whole neo.
1684;One of my favorite scenes was when he took on a Lycan bare.
1685;underworld makes a strong attempt at neo.
1686;I love love love this movie and the second one too.
1687;Underworld is a beautifully crafted movie about Selene (a vampire) who tries to help a human that the Lycans (wherewolves) are after.
1688;She finds herself liking him and goes on to help him even though it's forbidden to do so.
1689;She soon learns that her human, Michael, is someone very special.
1690;It is hightly specific for a certain kind of audience.

1694;the warewolves live underground and constantly beat eachother up.
1695;I thought the story managed a unique twist on an old theme.
1696;But hey, all the fighting poses were sleek and elegant.
1697;If you enjoy vampire stories.
1698;There was so much potential with this movie .
1699;people may start to be able to enjoy the movie!

1702;he works at a hospital, and his hair's all over the place!
1703;In a movie with a strong lead role, strong story, or *some* kind of strength somewhere .
1704;i'd like to add that this movie had really great special effects.
1705;work on the vampires was not only well done, but i'd even go as far as saying they were terrific!
1706;But let me tell you .
1707;As a main stream, vampire/werewolf movie this was nice.
1708;they did lay some nice ground work for a second .
1709;and very likely superior .
1710;This is a great story and has a lot of action going on.
1711;There were some places I squinted my eyes but I really enjoyed the story.
1712;this one is action packed.
1713;Then, how some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes theyve made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting.
1714;arcade like movies, this one actually has a story line.
1715;There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of love story novel cover type objects of affection.
1716;You want me to write the whole story?I was entertained.
1717;This one earned its #4 by pure excitement and entertainment.
1718;There's a big final punch.

1723;You don't really care who wins as long as there is damn good fight.
1724;"The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original."
1725;"Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years."
1726;She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint.
1727;"Pour this tight little body into a reflective rubber suit and you have something to anchor your movie""."
1728;the film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story.
1729;Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie.
1730;Well Blade or Blade II is certainly leaps and bounds ahead of this one.
1731;par and underestimated what audiences expected to see.
1732;I bought the movie thinking it was going to be a great action movie, YEP, it isn't.
1733;This movie is first off, one of the best vampire movies I have watched recently.
1734;Kate Beckinsale is an absolutly amazing actress.
1735;That takes a great skill.
1736;This human, Michael, is bitten by a werewolf and begins to see flashbacks of memories of the strongest Lycan.
1737;(For a good laugh, look at Lucian's face when Michael has his flashback at the Lycan's dwelling!)
1738;Underworld is a sleek, stylish action/horror flick that did pretty well at the box office.
1739;It touted an appetizing lead and promised mucho action, slow mo movements, and an intriguing tale.
1740;don't get me wrong, sleep directing and beautiful cinematography usually go hand in hand with a good movie, no matter what the genre.
1741;This is a good nod in the movies direction.
1742;Much like the Matrix and Blade, the film focuses primarily on kicking skills over chilling skills.
1743;If you have vampires and lycanthropes in the mix, it's always a good idea to attempt some fear too.
1744;Selene, who is the beautiful vampire assassin, finds out there is going to be an attempt by the sneaky werewolves to kidnap Michael Corvin, a human.
1745;the story itself sounds good on paper and could have looked terrific on screen.
1746;We gets hints here and there of this and that, but nothing in the face that shows us how truly valuable the love is to either.
1747;as with any movie of this form, weapons are galore.
1748;Our eyes get treated with supernatural critters being slayed with silver blade and bullets filled with such yummy substances as silver nitrate.
1749;"The action sequences were fine as they stood
1750;Some of the scenes were heart racing and visually strong, I must give the movie credit for that.
1751;As an assassin that's determined and strong, she comes through here with shining colors.
1752;Lucian was the best of them all, as he had more character development and was someone I actually gave a damn about.
1753;He had a purpose, a motivation, and reasoning behind this was fulfilled.
1754;Bill Nighy as the resurrected ancient did his role very well.
1755;The film has a purposeful blue hue cast over it, painting it a gorgeous gothic shade.
1756;Doom and gloom is easily felt during each frame.
1757;Werewolves looked most convincing, without using much CGI.
1758;The soundtrack is strong and pleasing to the ears, a great match.
1759;Great story, fantastic special effects and awesome action scenes.
1760;having said that, I have to say this:When I first heard about the movie, I thought Now that's a great idea.
1761;The film has this I've.
1762;like gadgets) and keep on loudly blowing everything that comes in the middle.
1763;Received the item in the condition it says and received the package within reasonable period.
1764;Of all the series of the """"underworld"""" movies I like the first and the second one the best"
1765;If you like vampire and werewolf movies, these are the best movies to watch.
1766;it turned out to be a love story.
1767;Part one of a love story.
1768;Now as for the movie, I thought it was great.
1769;to me Selene is an awesome character and personally I liked her better than Trinity.
1770;This is one fan who will be eagerly waiting in line with his ticket the day it is released.
1771;It's dark, it's cool, and at times, it can be rather cloudy.
1772;the basic plot is straightforward.
1773;on the positive side, this movie looks cool.
1774;The background, costumes, scenery, and music portray a dark, gothic world.
1775;The weapons are also sleek and stylish.
1776;This turned out to be a fairly entertaining movie.
1777;It takes the classic Hatfields and McCoys story line and substitues vampires and lycans(werewolves) for the two families.
1778;"Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance as the central ""death dealer"" of the vampires."
1779;the effects and sound of the movie are great.
1780;at the end of the day, what you have is a moderately interesting movie with nice special features.
1781;"The ""Underworld"" franchise exists for one reason: to punch you in the face."
1782;And just when I thought we were in for an interesting twist, they dropped it and didn't mention it again for the rest of the damn movie.
1783;Well, in the second installment it goes further, and fast.
1784;I'll tell you what did make me feel something: when he came back to life.
1785;But, I found Underworld to be an exception.
1786;Great looking film (with focus as sharp as a tack), especially well done considering that it is night throughout most of the movie.
1787;Except for the dialogue often being buried and hard to understand without blasting your ears into deafness, the sound mix is, otherwise, fantastic.
1788;Everything swirls and crashes and clinks its way around you.
1789;Great detail and really special special effects, I really fall in love with the beautiful MS Beckinsale in this movie very well done.
1790;But once again, Kate is sooo cool and hot that she literally carries the movie on her back.
1791;A fantastic movie, largely under appreciated, with a superb storyline and amazing action!
1792;Blu Ray transfer looks great and the PCM sound is likewise, especially if you have a good surround system to give it extra life.
1793;Kate Beckinsale, tight clothes, incredible eyes, and a vampire?
1794;A totally new and innovative look into the lives and times of the creatures of the night.
1795;Great plot, great acting, just enough violence to be suitable for young teens as well.
1796;This is a great movie that inspired a new perception about the world of Vampires and Lycans.
1797;disc Unrated Extended Edition also comes with a booklet that gives you a glimpse into the comic work of the Underworld.
1798;cutted with more details added and time sequence rearranged.
1799;the storyline was pretty decent, too.
1800;Loved everything about this movie, in fact, except .
1801;"Get your *own* look, please!Lastly, to the people who ""laughed"" through the entire movie and wrote a review to emphasize to everyone else how very sophisticated you are."
1802;Underworld is, after all, just a movie.
1803;the filming is very attractive.
1804;The movie has a gothic look to it .
1805;from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting.
1806;The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie.
1807;And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch.
1808;It works perfectly within this movie.
1809;The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45.
1810;"minute documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"", which talks about vampires and werewolves."
1811;The first kind having a thorough and well thought out plot.
1812;The 4th kind of movie actually manages to bring the plot backwards, so there is absolutely no hope in ever being entertained.
1813;Sweet movie if you like werewolves and vampires.
1814;Great movie and pretty interesting.
1815;Besides having an incredibly attractive vampire in leather, it also has a pretty good story to it.
1816;The graphics are great and the action just keeps going.
1817;One of the things that made this movie so good was the time and craftsmanship they spent on the werewolf outfits.
1818;I love all of the Underworld movies.
1819;First one is my favorite.
1820;After this one, you'll probably want to see the whole series.
1821;I have never been much of a vampire movie buff, but I truly enjoyed this one.
1822;"I've never read the comic strip, so I can't say whether or not the movie sticks with the strip
1823;series, the director masterfully and mercifully edits the story and footage"
1824;one of the great things about this movie is that it has a dark, Gothic feel to it that pervades the cinematography of entire movie, which provides the perfect setting for a vicarious ride into the Underworld.
1825;now for the story: the Lycans are werewolf rebels, the Vampires are immortal overlords and there is a great deal of lamentatious history between the two of them.
1826;"seline (Kate Beckinsale) is jaded and nonconforming
1827;But the Lycans know, thanks to the dark master of the Lycan horde, Lucian.
1828;But he is a power hungry, aristocratic vampire with ambitions of securing a place of power within the hierarchy vampire elders"
1829;For some, this has the making of a cult classic, and I think I may just be one of them (and I do not particularly like this genre).
1830;I had seen this one before, so you know I liked it in order to rewatch it.
1831;I caught it when it was out in theatres last summer and really liked it.
1832;but I was happy with the overall movie.
1833;Underworld is a great source of inspiration for those who enjoy role.
1834;Let me say right up front, I love monster movies, and I'm very forgiving of their flaws.
1835;If you're like me and you love supernatural critters onscreen, then this is the flick for you.
1836;That said, there are some refreshingly unexpected plot twists, and the line between protagonist and antagonist often becomes blurred .
1837;Horror fans will also be happy to see a mummy of sorts and another supernatural predator later on which can only be described as incredibly geek.
1838;stealer, what with his slight frame, arm sword, and ability to simply spit out silver bullets by flexing.
1839;Trust me, he's a fun character.
1840;this is a popcorn flick, people, and a fun one.
1841;It is Terribly underrated for starters.
1842;You souldn't watch this movie if you aren't interested in vampires or in Goth but if you are then it is the perfect movie for you.
1843;i have allready seen it twice in the cinema and i just wanted to come back for more.
1844;I love this movie and you urge you to see it.
1845;"There are three essential items you should have in order to fully enjoy this movie to the max:1) A big screen TV, preferably widescreen
1846;have these three things, and you will absolutely love this movie.
1847;The action scenes are quite intense, and the special effects are really something to behold.
1848;Yet, I was hooked by the surprisingly interesting plot to this movie.
1849;The visual and sound effects are still quite good even on a normal TV (like what most of us have), and so I still enjoyed it in other ways.
1850;overall, I recommend this movie for action/special effects enthusiasts.
1851;Also, I recommend this movie if you do not like Lost in Translation (I did a review on that, also), it is a huge change of pace from that movie and it will keep you entertained in a way that most people can enjoy.
1852;And in that sense, it works well.
1853;Kate Beckinsale does good work, decked out in black leather and steel mini.
1854;gun, and fits beautifully into the deliberately desaturated, color.
1855;an effort is made to provide scientific origins for the supernatural, something also done in the recent Blade franchise, and to do more practical stunts than the CGI.
1856;It doesn't always hold together, nor service the story, but the strength of the overall vision is enough to hold interest.
1857;It is definitely a bold movie taking you into the world of darkness where now, vampires are at war with the lycans.
1858;the story is intertwined with love and blood feud like one of those shakespearean plays.
1859;it's definitely action packed and I'm sure a sequel is to follow.
1860;I enjoyed the plot twists though the love.
1861;The characters are definitely interesting.
1862;The movie does a good job in not progessing into a gory horror show, but rather keep it to the action genre.
1863;It's definitely worth the watch for both story and good action.
1864;I thought it was a great """"dark action"""" movie."""
1865;i thought the premise was enjoyable, the sets apropros' to the film.
1866;The fight scenes are great.
1867;i think it's wonderful to see a female lead that kicks butt and takes no prisoners.
1868;finally, face it, there are never enough cool werewolf movies!
1869;"if you're willing to sit back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy a ""thrill ride""."
1870;Underworld is a RARE gem!!
1871;It's an action thriller that combines kick ass action sequences with great writing, stupendous acting and MIND.
1872;After seeing this movie, I felt like I got my money's worth, and I think you'll feel the same way.
1873;Love this one, in fact the whole series is good.
1874;The movie itself is good and the special effects are top notch.
1875;The whole concept of Licantropes vs. Vampires is very interesting.
1876;alike types of the characters (except the wonderful Beckingsale).
1877;With the only plus of a couple of good ideas.
1878;Raking it in from fans who expect and want more.
1879;This is a great movie with lots of action.
1880;I would recommend it to any vampire/werewolf fan.
1881;I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series.
1882;This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films.
1883;Even Underworld is a love story at heart.
1884;And not only is the lead sexy, but the co. stars are two of my favorite British actors.
1885;I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing.
1886;Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well.
1887;Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.
1888;the finale in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion.
1889;I do happen to love werewolves as well.
1890;They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history.
1891;I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least.
1892;That said, I still enjoyed the R&J.
1893;the story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals.
1894;The gothic look was used perfectly.
1895;The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece.
1896;I can say that for the entire film actually.
1897;The pacing is great, and the lack of quick.
1898;I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them.
1899;I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves.
1900;Yes, it's very easy indeed.
1901;Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience.
1902;This is a film that certainly should stand as an example of style over substance.
1903;All the actors (except Scott Speedman)run around obviously feeling very cool and stylish in their dark costumes, but they forget to invest any real feeling into their performances.
1904;She's got a lean body and the right features for the role.
1905;But she's really pretty light.
1906;the film gets two stars (rather than one) for the costumes and for the great special effects when an ancient vampire (played by Bill Nighy) is brought prematurely back to life.
1907;He puts on layers of himself and we get to see the gory transformation.
1908;The main thing you need to know is that a human medical student, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), gets in the way.
1909;Action packed modern twist on vampire and werewolf competition.
1910;Almost totally believable, just suspend your powers of disbelief.
1911;This is very ambitious film about vampires and werewolves.
1912;story is the best part of the movie.
1913;day adaptation of these creatures .
1914;In some respects this is interesting, since if these creatures did exist they would probably adapt in this way.
1915;and an interesting twist involving who the real bad guys are.
1916;Destined to become a cult classic I thought this movie about vampires andwerewolfs was great!
1917;I had watched this movie the first time right when it came out but I just watched it again and decided this is a movie to speak on.
1918;day vampire movies, average is a great compliment.
1919;day viewers love, a whole lot of weapons and fast movement and loud noises that will leave you deaf.
1920;Kate Beckingsale was actually quite good in this film compared to her paper.
1921;feeling vampire and she fought well.
1922;The others actors were fine as well, but Kate Beckingsale is truly the only one who shines.
1923;But for the main body of vampires and werewolves it's just a main battle for power and dominance.
1924;That's fine with me though, but when they say there's a romance I expect to see something brewing!
1925;overall nonetheless, it was worth seeing once, and at least this movie respected the myth of vampires and werewolves, unlike so many other films.
1926;That much alone gives the film a solid three stars.
1927;Except, this is also a tale of vampires and werewolves.
1928;Mind you, it's a fine movie.
1929;It's fun, it's got good action scenes, it's got good f/x, but there's something missing.
1930;"The acting is another thing
1931;the look of the film is quite good.
1932;the movie's ending lets the door open for a sequel, and talks are supposed to have been going on about not only one but two new movies, one of them being a prequel.
1933;But I recently viewed the """"unrated extended cut"""", and I gotta admit."""
1934;"For 2+ hours, I bought into the idea of the ""Underworld""."
1935;i enjoyed it for what it was, and I'll definitely be checking it out again (as well as the Underworld sequel, whenever it's released).
1936;These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.
1937;top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.
1938;Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore.
1939;Kate Beckinsale was great, action from beginning to ending of the movie.
1940;seriously, though, it's a great movie.
1941;packed, and with some good acting.
1942;Having said that it was great fun to watch.
1943;Kate Beckinsale makes every scene she is in deep, dark and wonderful.
1944;Even when she is posing gun forward, dodging bullets that seem to kill everyone to the left and right of her she is fabulous.
1945;She manages to pull off the perfect combination of badass and vulnerable that every great tough chick heroine needs.
1946;The look and feel of the movie is comic bookish and alluring, and holds up even though this movie is a few years old.
1947;Look, this movie was exciting.
1948;"You end up wanting to know more about this world, how these vampires and lycons interact with ""normal"" folk like me, and certainly, what happens AFTER the events in this movie."
1949;The action is great, the acting is not too shabby (look tired and thin, but ready for action), and the sets really are interesting, even with the hanging chains and dripping ceilings.
1950;"According to Wikipedia, ""Lycon can refer to one of two persons."
1951;"Second, a fellow by the name of Lycon was involved in the trial of Socrates, and acted as one of the three prosecuters."""
1952;It is definitely worth seeing if you like sci.
1953;You pick up something new each time you watch it.
1954;Appropriate age range and rating.
1955;So why did you give it 4 stars?
1956;It's definitely an interesting idea combining two of the best horror species and the movie allows for some definite eye candy moments.
1957;Given that I believe, as I do with many movies, that it is best not know too much about the story so as not to build up any expectations.
1958;Even with that I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't too much of a love story (thankfully!)
1959;I've been a fan of good Sci.
1960;INCREDIBLY good and will amaze you that the plot is actually very REMARKABLE.
1961;And Kate still looks hot.
1962;This is a must watch, especially for folks into the White.
1963;This is best seen in widescreen, on a 60 inch DLP with Dolby 5.1 surround.
1964;It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is.
1965;It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator.
1966;It would make a good pc.
1967;This is just like a great pop video, lots of special effects and cool looking characters .
1968;costumes are great, settings are very gothic, the technology is really cool (they heavily borrow here from the TV series Ultraviolet).
1969;The idea seems good, Vampires Vs Werewolves.
1970;I was expecting the best of Blade Meets an American Werewolf in Paris.
1971;And, for it's budget, it had some really well done special effects.
1972;This is best sounding Blu.
1973;Picture qualty is great too.
1974;But alas, when you make big promises you have to follow through with a big delivery.
1975;the fact that these unique, legendary creatures would have to resort to a non.
1976;It's dark and it has a great plot in my opinion.
1977;I think this is an excellent movie to watch.
1978;action packed, fast paced and all the elements of storey telling, certainly not a academy award winner,but good value for your buck !
1979;He rescues her after she hits her head on the windshield and gets knocked out, pulls her from thewater, gives her CPR, after which she coughs out a little water and comes to.
1980;And after all this, Selena tells Kraven He saved my life.
1981;The acting was actually verye good.
1982;It is a visually stylish movie as far as dress and scenery.
1983;I liked the idea of vampires and werewolves descending from one anscestor.
1984;I thought that Viktor's tomb was very cool, and the visual effects of the awakening of Viktor were pretty slick.
1985;The action was surprising entertaining, and the film was shot beautifully (I LOVE the lighting!)
1986;The theme is also something I've never seen dealt with prior to this movie.
1987;Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires.
1988;"The werewolves from ""The Howling"" 20 years ago had better make up."
1989;I was greatly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.
1990;The character of Selene was thoughtfully brought to life with Kate's performance and I believe it was this that made the movie a success.
1991;It was very wise to focus a lot of the movie on Selene's character growth.
1992;underworld proves that a movie with a modest budget can still delight fans with excellent characters, particularlly Selene, and a well constructed story.

2002;up to a series, and it takes some serious confidence if you believe that you are guaranteed a series of big.
2003;Kate Beckinsale is stunning in this .
2004;The effects are decent, but nothing ground.
2005;The premise of werewolves fighting vampires is cool, but a more involving plotline would've been even cooler.
2006;All in all it got the level of acclaim it deserved and nothing more.
2007;I thought it would be great to see an original movie where they had battles.
2008;This is mainly for the diehard Vampire (or Werewolf) fans.
2009;"All in all, this is one of those movies that you watch if you're a fan of 'Dracula 2000'(yes, it
2010;The beginning of the movie was great.
2011;The story was very good at first.
2012;They had several twists and shocking discoveries which made things interesting.
2013;Point is, it is a good movie until the conclusion.
2014;This is one of those movies that could have been great.
2015;the story line is wonderful, but for the first thirty min.
2016;although the concepts between the two waring factions in the film were wonderfully contrived, the fight scenes .
2017;See it if you are bored.
2018;Follow up with the 2nd movie.
2019;this is a great movie and one that I am very happy to own.
2020;It has a lot of vampires, werewolves and a lot of action.
2021;If you like vampires and werewolves I think it will be well worth your time to check it out.
2022;This is a great movie!!!
2023;So be sure to check it out
2024;For what it is, and what it has to work with, it is a very good title that will, for the most part, keep you entertained from start to finish.

2028;Good Vampire vs. Lycon flick, I enjoyed them all pretty much.
2029;Story is okay action is great and drama and suspense is in there a bit as well.
2030;This is quite a good first time movie from the director and co. screenwriters.
2031;the Vampires are decadent, the Werewolves gritty and their conflicts both high.
2032;But if you liked Blade, The Crow and the first two Alien movies, you'll probably like this one.
2033;It's possible to see several influences in Underworld but it has enough fresh material to be a very new on the Vampires vs Werewolves battles.
2034;Played wonderfully by Kate Beckinsale, Selene is driven, ruthless, tough and more vulnerable than she knows.
2035;awakening and a changing of the world for the Vampire and Werewolves Clans.
2036;There's a good mix of background, lots of action, great characters and a premise that hangs together.
2037;The mythology is well described and seems to be thought out very well.
2038;It's definitely worth a look.
2039;This is a great movie.
2040;Not the best I've seen in the genre but worth spending the time watching as it was free with Prime.
2041;This is an other great port over into the Blu.
2042;The resolution and flow of the movie technically is very good.
2043;This may not seem like a big deal to those who are used to watching fullscreen films, but to those who aren't (and cannot bear to watch them like myself) please do yourself a favor and get the widescreen edition instead, in order to fully enjoy the feel of the movie as to it's theatrical counterpart.
2044;If you want to see gun blazing action between werewolves and vampires, Underworld delivers.
2045;The visual effects of their transformations are awe inspiring.
2046;The beautifully sculpted Beckensale is hypnotic to watch in her skin.
2047;She does a good job acting the part and leading the film but she needs to play paintball a few times to learn how to move her hands like a real experienced gunfighter.
2048;They're fully automatic and can blast away for about a minute without a fresh magazine.
2049;all in all, it's a decent action vampire film with good visual effects.
2050;This is an interesting film which maintains a fine dark gothic feel, blended with elements of the modern thrown in for good measure as well.
2051;Yes it has plenty of action.
2052;one clear influence is The Matrix.
2053;That said this does have a considerable amount of style and I will be quite happy to watch this again.
2054;On the second viewing, a few things caught my attention.
2055;well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no?
2056;packed thriller about this war called Underworld.
2057;the effects are great in this flick.
2058;key words: a couple) protecting that key.
2059;all in all a very well done story that will likely spawn many more modern day Vampire versus Werewolf movies to come.
2060;underworld: Evolution!The sequel holds much promise actually.
2061;That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).
2062;It's definitely a keeper for those into the genre.
2063;This is one of my favorites and best vampire movies.
2064;But that can be over looked with cool scenes and a great story line.
2065;If you watch the film with very high expectations, then yes, you may think of it that way.
2066;timers Len Wiseman and Danny McBride, and give it some leeway, it can be very entertaining.
2067;She is excellent as the vampire Selene, and she looks really hot in the tight leather outfit.
2068;the action scenes in the film are amazing.
2069;The film really is very good, despite what many critics have said.
2070;The key to enjoying this movie is to not expect much from it.
2071;A worthy plot interwoven with action scenes galore make this film an excellent addition to the genre.
2072;This film is full of action, and I like it when a movie is full of action.
2073;This movie has a lot of the action.
2074;If you enjoy a good action movie, with some awesome special effects, then this is the movie for you.
2075;selene is a beautiful vampire who has a major dislike for the Lycans (the werewolves).
2076;She spends a great deal of time tracking and killing them.
2077;Now he will become a Lycon, but Selene is drawn to him, and feels she must help Michael.
2078;what I enjoyed about this movie is the use of the advanced technology used to during the fights.
2079;They use high tech firearms, computers, and fancy cars.
2080;I have a weakness for handsome black men with bald heads, and deep voices.
2081;one of my favorite scenes is of Selene jumping off the building.
2082;I watch that scene about a 100 times because it's so amazing to me.
2083;I enjoyed the movies plot twist, the dark themes, the action, this is a very stylish film.
2084;this is an excellent movie, and the ending certainly left room for a sequel.
2085;After watching the film, you have to watch the extras.
2086;The Making of Underworld, Creature effects, stunts, and Sights and Sounds.
2087;I agree with many of the people giving good comments about this movie.
2088;The movie feels a bit shallow but it is very entertaining.
2089;By the way, Kate Beckinsale was charming and played beautifully (better than the Matrix's Trinity.
2090;And I've no doubt that Kate is a very talented actress).
2091;Fast paced action with a good story line and you end up with the Underworld series!
2092;Visually, it's a feast of inspiration and a story that is literally told from a visual standpoint as well as a literal standpoint.
2093;Bearing in mind the director has taken an age old concept and shaken it up a bit.
2094;What we see in Underworld is a story of the persecution and the revelation of what real truth is.
2095;Most just see a movie like this as a simple action flick with really cool special effects.
2096;This story is so much more than that.
2097;Much of this story shows how truth is often betrayed and manipulated over the cost of stepping out of the boundaries to a brave new world.
2098;If you go into this movie thinking the female vampire and the male lycan are in love or have a steamy romance, you're far from the mark of this movie.
2099;There's more truth to this story than what appears.

2109;A comic book will also be included in the packaging.
2110;This movie has some great special effects and not the cheap ones you see in so many movies.
2111;If you like thriller movies, this will please you.

2115;I really enjoyed this movie.
2116;Twice you see blood going into Viktor, once to awake him and once to regain his physical appearance.
2117;But this film looks interesting.
2118;"I think that Kate Beckinsale is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood (why they didn't choose her for ""Tomb Raider,"" I'll never know), and she looks extremely sexy in this one!"
2119;To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects.
2120;intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.

2122;stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho.
2123;"He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and ""The Matrix"" ever to be truly engaging in its own right."
2124;Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.
2125;It was entertaining and fun.
2126;A unique look at vampires and werewolves that was enjoyable to go along for the ride.
2127;A lot of action and good special effects.
2128;This is Mr, Wiseman's first directorial outing, and it shows all over.
2129;The day I got back from seeing Matrix: Reloaded, I was itching to see another action film, hopefully one even better than Reloaded.
2130;On the edge of my seat, biting my nails as I eagerly waited to hear news about the third Matrix movie, or maybe the second Resident Evil, I saw a trailer for Underworld.
2131;they discover he's a Lycan, and he has to escape.
2132;all in all, this is an amazing movie.
2133;Worth your time, I assure you.
2134;A great story, amazing special effects (I adore the werewolf transformations .
2135;, and plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.
2136;Underworld is a great movie.
2137;I love their clothes and how the people turn into wolfs.
2138;This movie is so awesome.
2139;This was a great movie!
2140;this is an ACTION film!
2141;The trailer told you what this film was about.
2142;It has guns, fighting and a love story subplot.
2143;Underworld has nice visual ideas and it is easy to find yourself taken in by this world.
2144;The characters take themselves seriously and the short dramatic scenes that are there are fine.
2145;"crafted masterpiece that ""Interview"" was, but this is an ACTION film."
2146;"When you go see ""The Mummy"", are you expecting the acting calibre of ""A Beautiful Mind?"
2147;Underworld was a great story.
2148;every time i am hung over i will watch this and enjoy it.
2149;if bill nighy is in something, you watch it, you love him and that is that.
2150;"while Selene is helping to keep Michael alive and out of ""harms"" way, from both Lycans and vampires, She and Michael form an unlikely bond."
2151;And, For myself, that is when this movie got extremely interesting when Lucian ( Michael Sheen ) was on the screen.
2152;Michael Sheen had the standout performance in this movie, as the character Lucian.
2153;All and all, Underworld was surprisely, a good movie.
2154;Except for the over use sometimes of the characters resolving their issues with the use of their guns, instead of just using their brains for once, and thinking of a better way to do battle with one another, The movie was very interesting to see.
2155;This makes a Jhon Grisham book sound good.
2156;The Trailer was inspired, the posters were eye candy, the concept was brilliant.
2157;cinematography: Everything is pretty much soaked in this blue.
2158;You must care for all of these characters for one reason and for one reason alone: they look really cool in black.
2159;Much like the Matrix Reloaded we are merely teased with the prospect of a true supernatural war of fantasies most inventive creations.
2160;The action scenes never become exciting.
2161;"kata"" which made it very enjoyable to watch."
2162;Vampires symbolize ageless, immortal power, sensuality, and dark gracefulness.
2163;They are that element of human nature that is dark refinement, ageless refined, sexually eloquent power.
2164;So it's very cool to have a movie playing off the symbolic equivalents of the differing psychologies of the audience members.
2165;it's a great ride, too, with very Matrix.
2166;"esque action sequences that pull you along at great speed, catapulting you into this ""underground"" world."
2167;still, it sure is fun, and a good action ride!
2168;movie comic book, all in cool case with sleeve.
2169;overall, a definately good flick for vamp/werewolf lovers (with pretty darn good effects!
2170;The scene with Michael in the back of the cop car was spectacular).
2171;Go in with no expectations, and it'll undoubtedly be a hit.
2172;Go in expecting superb acting and romantic chemistry between the hero and heroine, and look for another movie.
2173;Together with Underworld: Evolution, two great films.
2174;"packed, fast paced, great photograhpy and special effects
2175;A must see for action/vampire film lovers.
2176;This the first film to see.
2177;Then see Underworld: Evolution, to keep the story straight.
2178;All and all I do hope for the next movie and hope for better then the 2.5 stars I would rate this one!
2179;I really love to watch these mvies.
2180;This is a thriller with a brain.
2181;Overall I have to say even though you could pick Underworld apart it was very enjoyable.
2182;The whole idea of this movie seemed to be create the perfect combination of The Matrix and Dracula .
2183;In some ways this works, as there are some really good action scenes here, as well as the expected dark and rain that comes along with a movie like this.
2184;All this is quite interesting, as is the history of the war, and the way the vampires are ruled in shifts.
2185;the acting is good here, and Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful, but it is not enough to make you forget that there is something missing in this movie: wall to wall action and a couple of hours of entertainment.
2186;This movie has a great premise.
2187;The performances are adequate enough and the action is watchable, though not very original.
2188;the art direction is good and Kate Beckinsale in a catsuit is always worth a look, but it could have been so much better.
2189;Thank you for this gift.
2190;I have seen a lot of movies like this and this series is one of my favorites.
2191;Thats pretty much how I got thru this movie.
2192;I really wanted to like this movie and had hope after the exciting opening scenes, but eventually I found all the betrayals and double.
2193;a lot of cool special effects so early on made the film peak too soon and the middle section sags with hardly a werewolf transformation to be seen.
2194;the morphing scenes from human to werewolf are pretty cool.
2195;out, spartan romantic connection between the main female and male protagonists.
2196;The plot story was great, acting great.
2197;I liked it so much I got the two disc version.
2198;I hope they make a sequel.
2199;Shane, my good man, I sincerely hope your poetry is better than your acting.
2200;If you're a regular person (meaning not an indie film twit) who enjoys a good horror / gothic / action flick, this is the best one of the year.
2201;The costumes are incredible, Kate Beckinsdale is delicious.
2202;reloading thing, but I can forgive one friggin' oversight), the gothy cinematography is superb even if it does resemble a cologne commercial at times, and I absolutely love how they managed to give the city in this film that whole """"generic dark gothic city in Europe"""" feel."""
2203;It works and works well.
2204;I have a thing for gothic mansions, and that's one of the best ones I've ever seen in a movie.
2205;i love this film despite the could.
2206;I think the story is great, and I highly recommend it.
2207;It may not be original, but it is enjoyable.
2208;If you see it and hate it, you can join a class.
2209;a lycanthrope is a person inflicted with lycanthropy.
2210;It is the best horror flick I've seen come along ina long time.
2211;I'll let you discover all the surprisesfor yourself.

2213;Oh, and yes, it does have a good plot.
2214;If you think this looks cool, go see it.

2218;One of my all time favorite stories, not to mention Kate Beckinsale one of Hollywoods most beautiful actresses, thanks for filming the movie sguys !!!
2219;Yes the actions scenes are slowed down while a dark blue tinged, protruding, picture carries you through a film of gunfire, some martial arts, and rain.
2220;despite the comparisons, watch with an open mind, because the concept is very unique, and the story is intresting and smart.
2221;Wow, a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves.
2222;After the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought perhaps that I was in for a treat.
2223;the only redemption for this movie is that Kate Beckinsale is stunning as the vampire death.
2224;the original pleased me immensely,but it had me wanting to see more.
2225;I love this movie and I was able to find it on Amazon and they delivered it in no time.
2226;As always I am please with the service I receive from Amazon.
2227;Visually Stunnig with excellant sound,good movie to forget all your problems and escape in to.
2228;While there is not much I have to add to the other reviews, I will say that this is a phenomenal movie, as are the others in the series of Underworld movies.
2229;Not only do vampires and werewolves make for interesting and entertaining protagonists and antagonists, but they also make for some pretty cool and imaginative fight scenes.
2230;if you enjoy action films with great fighting, but not really all that much blood, gore and guts, this would be a great film to pursue.
2231;paced, the cast is attractive, and the special features are very interesting, all at a great price.
2232;fi, action, vampires or forbidden love, this is the movie to watch.
2233;Speaking as an fan of action, this movie is visually appealing.
2234;The camera work adds to the adreniline on the action sequence.
2235;Where as, Michael plays an excellent girlfriend.
2236;Nothing really ground breaking here, but a solid action movie, don't think too much about the plot although they did try to give it some depth it comes across as somewhat predictable.
2237;ray Give This Movie Serious Consideration.
2238;it Will Most Certainly Be A Movie I Watch Many More Times Then Once.
2239;Ms. Beckinsale does a great job as usual.
2240;The plot is good, the acting is acceptable, and the action is good.
2241;"Things aren't as they seem, or so Selene soon discovers
2242;UNDERWORLD belongs in the rows of horror wonders.
2243;The direction is terrific and occasionally artful"
2244;The story is also an awesome idea and is brought out well.
2245;There's also a very cool Lycan transformation scene reminiscent of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.
2246;UNDERWORLD is one delicious bite of horror cinema that you'll be howling about for days on end.
2247;Well, first off, if you are interested in vampires, this one is going to entertain you.
2248;now onto the more particular info.
2249;i have always had an interest in vampires, gothic subjects, etc.
2250;This movie does a great job of getting into the inner workings of a mythical/created vampire sect (coven) and makes the journey of discovery interesting.
2251;Also, the weapons employed in the movie, the special effects, and the soundtrack are also deserving of mention.
2252;I haven't seen the Hollywood remake, but the original was amazing.
2253;If you can free yourself from your Hollywood expectations of how fast stuff should happen on screen, the Solaris remake is very good scifi.
2254;This is a great movie, especially for those who enjoyed Van Helsing and Constantine.
2255;The effects were complete and amazing throughout the entire production.
2256;There is a deep sense of emotion in the film, but no crappy love scenes with vampire or werewolves.
2257;I applaud the film makers for keeping this film above.
2258;It will go down as one of my favorite films of all time.
2259;she loves high octane action flicks with fancy camera work gothic settings and a strong female lead.
2260;i can understand the elite or the general public hating it but this movie was built around a fanboys super geek id!I know because I am a cynical super geek myself and despite Underworlds faults they still managed not only to make a really cool looking flick but they also did something new with the idea of both vamps and wolves while still having an even further amazing plot and backstory!!!!
2261;Loved the movie, full of action and a great storyline.
2262;It was a great mix of action and dialogue that keeps you watching for more.
2263;recommend for the Vampire fanatics, or casual movie fan.
2264;The gun fights, the action, The effects all great!
2265;Kate Beckensale is mesmerizingly beautiful in this role.
2266;This is every Vampires/Warewolf fans dream come true.
2267;I love the whole underworld thing.
2268;the film on its own is a winner.
2269;than this extended cut came and made it even better.
2270;it also containes the best special features i've seen to date.
2271;i especially liked the Fang Vs Fiction Documentaries based on the werewolf and vampire lore through the ages.
2272;Not only does this movie have style , but it also has some of the best action sequences in a vampire movie, as well as one of the best storylines, which is sometimes hard to find in a vampire movie.
2273;So please, do yourself a favor and get this movie for your PSP.
2274;"Underworld has two great things in it
2275;we got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest"
2276;Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.
2277;But in this case, the original is much better than the new version.
2278;he is also the huge Black guy with the incredible voice who plays a Lycan).
2279;It also has a technical commentary that I haven't listened to yet.
2280;it just has extra scenes in it.
2281;The entire movie is paced this way.
2282;Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.
2283;There are so many ways of writing a story like this and I believe a good job was done in the making of the movie from the settings, (being so dark and gloomy .
2284;"Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade"" to forge a bullet."
2285;packed from the outset, this darkly.
2286;For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra.
2287;"actor Kevin Grevioux, former ""Stargate"" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself."
2288;strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex.
2289;naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose.
2290;Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him.
2291;"million production so that ""Underworld"" can compete with the films that inspired it."
2292;"Although it cannot compare with ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld""manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production."
2293;Underworld is a film that continues to water down vampires as most of us know them.
2294;climactic final confrontation I have seen in recent cinema.
2295;So if you want a somewhat fun action movie this show is for you, but don't be expecting anything new, or for that matter even anything all that entertaining.
2296;As an Action movie Underworld is good, the battle sequences between the Lycons (Werewolves) and Vampires are spectacular.
2297;The transformations for the Werewolves are also cool and one of the better ones (using CGI of course).
2298;However with the spectacular action and better than average acting (there is no campy characters) this is definetly a good movie.
2299;The underworld series in one of the best movies series I have had the pleasure to watch thank you producers
2300;In fact, I read plenty of professional reviews trashing this film prior to seeing it.
2301;"And to that effect, ""Underworld"" succeeds extraordinarily."
2302;It's true that oscar material it ain't, but damn was it entertaining.
2303;"Underworld is the quintessential ""guilty pleasure"" movie."
2304;regardless, Underworld sports some of the most stylish cinematography I have ever seen in any movie.
2305;The action sequences are all taut and well done.
2306;the movie provides some good new ideas for the vampire and werewolf mythologies.
2307;I especially loved the idea of vampires using laptops, cell phones, and automatic weapons to keep up wtih times.
2308;"drinking nature of vampires in general, which was so central to films like ""Interview with the Vampire"" (the greatest vampire flick of all time)."
2309;chic costumes that makes her a delight to watch.
2310;This is certainly a whole other side to Kate compared with Serendipity.
2311;She makes a very satisfying action hero.
2312;"power"" action heros that I actually like."
2313;I'll take her over any of those Charlie's Angels any day, that's for sure.
2314;Yes, Underworld is overflowing with them.
2315;The plot is indeed woefully convoluted, but includes many clever twists to keep the audience guessing and amused.
2316;"brain"" supernatural rollarcoaster, Underworld is a pretty good bet."
2317;This movie set a new approach along with the Van Helsing of the supernatural themes of wolfman and vampires.
2318;Sexy and thrilling with Great special effects, cinematograohy and soundtrack.
2319;Kate Beckinsale's acting is amazing and her clothes, I must say, simply gorgeous.
2320;Scott Speedman plays his part well, the only debatable part of his character being that he turns into a strange erm.
2321;The special effects are excellent.
2322;The storyline is good, though there are parts of the movie which are questionable, judge for yourself.
2323;combination of hot woman, action, and thrills.
2324;a must see if you are into vampire movies.
2325;this is a must see.
2326;a true modern classic vampire werewolf film.
2327;This tale of cross species lovers has elements that borrow from Shakesphere.
2328;"When I went back to watch it again with a a friend I really enjoyed ""Underworld"" for what it is."
2329;"stylish and well directed by Len Wiseman from a story conceived by Wiseman (a former art director on ""Stargate SG1"", writer Danny McBride (""The Outer Limits"" and a stunt co. ordinator/actor on many film projects) andactor/stuntman Kevin Grevioux (who also appears in the film as a Lycan), ""Underworld"" may borrow its look from ""The Matrix"" but the themes in the story are as old as the Greek tragedies."
2330;"Combining the story, stunts and a sharp visual sense makes ""Underworld"" more than the sum of its influences."
2331;Featuring a new commentary track with stars Beckinsale, Speedman and director Wiseman, this edition is closer in final form to the film Wiseman wanted released.
2332;the transfer of the Extended Edition looks marvelous.
2333;Once again, it appears to be a high definition transfer and, while there's is occasional edge enhancement and halos, the overall look of the film is terrific.
2334;The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound will give your speakers a work out as well.
2335;"Overall, ""Underworld"" is quite an achievement for a first feature film."
2336;This is the best of the set!
2337;I hope they make a couple more.
2338;Usually when the lead of an action flick is female she's showing a lot of skin along with her skin tight clothing.
2339;because it's a pretty good vampire vs warewolf flick.
2340;This is a cult movie in the making.
2341;I love movies that keep you thinking, that have strange twists and that are not predictable.
2342;I thought the story was great, acting was good, special effects good, and the ending awesome.
2343;I can't wait for part 2 and yes, it will be one I actually go the theater to see.
2344;For me, that is saying something.
2345;My kids were sleeping while we were watching this and I wanted my 4 year old son to be able to see this later.
2346;werewolf lover, this is the best flick in the last 30 years.
2347;Will see the next film.
2348;Horror buffs who watch this film like myself, can cry over how great the film could have been, given that there is so much potential behind the material.
2349;one could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story.
2350;There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches.
2351;If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.
2352;underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it.
2353;The unrated edition adds about 12 minutes of footage to the film, but honestly, I did not notice a huge difference, a few extended fight scenes.
2354;Some great fighting seqences, and Camera/computer work as well.
2355;And Kate beckinsale, excellent choice for the character.
2356;One wonders, is there some Underworld 2 in store?
2357;The transformation of the werewolves were good and realistic and they looked good not pathetic namby pamby dogs some movies portray them to be.
2358;The scene in which you see Viktor come back to life is good as well.
2359;however its a worthwhile fare overwall.
2360;This has got to be the best movie ever.
2361;the acting is amazing, the combat is crazy, the lycans, vampires, and hybrids look super real and Kate Beckinsale is the hottist woman alive.
2362;I really, really liked the theatrical release of Underworld, so when I finally got a Blu Ray player I picked it up on blu ray pretty quickly.
2363;None of it was relevant or really entertaining.
2364;The rest of the extra footage was pretty much the same.
2365;There were bits and pieces of scattered throughout, but it really all belonged on the cutting room floor.
2366;Instead I got a movie with very good action scenes but, more importantly, a very interesting plot.
2367;The entire weaving of the gothic structures and modern city.
2368;but in few movies so well as in this one.
2369;and I am definitely keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel!
2370;I liked the original Underworld but to the degree of it being a 3 1/2 versus this version, which does a much better job at maintaining continuity and fleshing out the storyline so that many questions from the original were answered, and one backstory made the character's intentions much more viable.
2371;the good news is the increased depth in characters.
2372;Adding, removing or editing a more concise segment or two can make the film vastly more enjoyable past the bullets and blood.
2373;Thankfully for screengoers both actresses aquitted themselves nicely, Beckensdale even more than Bonham Carter, as Carter's role was a scene stealing, tremendous character.
2374;The film has the gothic, European look with characters that work until you hear SoCal actors subtracting from the mood.
2375;In the Director's cut, Speedman's character is given 3 dimensions and the film benefits, but they whole unknown town theme is lost by the hodegpoge of three or four English speaking styles.
2376;the new version proves, at least to my satisfaction, that good old filmaking skills are required beyond special effects, be they physical or CGI.
2377;great cast, overworked premise and literally, hijacked film.
2378;Underworld Directors Cut is a better film than the original.
2379;There is considerable extras from the original release's already generous extras.
2380;if extras motivate you, there's plenty new mateirial to enjoy.
2381;my rating is not quite a five star film, but it's a steady 4, perhaps higher as I watch it more.
2382;edited and original?Be that the case.
2383;It's actually an entertaining romp that is mostly eye candy but does have some interesting acting in it.
2384;His children inherited that trait.
2385;savingly good job of representing the various packs of night critters involved.
2386;The lycans impressively shape shift into massive, combat.
2387;bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries.
2388;There are some great action sequences, a lot of fine back stabbing, and generally a great deal of enthusiasm on all sides when the fur starts flying.
2389;grab some popcorn and just enjoy the ride.
2390;If you've ever heard of them, you may be interested in this film as well.
2391;It's really a fun movie and the whole Amazon Prime free viewing really improves my ability to enjoy cool B action SciFi flix.
2392;So what do we expect a good story awesome graphics, and taking an old remdeial story of Romeo and Juliette and putting it in modern age might make this a sure hit.
2393;I find it should be exciting and action packed to the max.
2394;So what should everyone do find the piece of the story everyone will enjoy and go see this movie, looking great.
2395;This version is fine, but the original version would have been fine as well.
2396;Cut the running length in half and I might recommend it as a bit of brainless eye candy.
2397;If you don't own the original, it's up to you.
2398;I got this thanks to a gift card and will probably be selling it as soon as I've shown it to a friend.
