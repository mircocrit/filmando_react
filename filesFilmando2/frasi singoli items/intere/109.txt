I:8873;1;A touching story about coming to terms with money and brotherly love, Rain Man is one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:8873;2;most people are too condescending to get into this touching tale.
I:8873;3;its also very emotional in many parts.
I:8873;4;shes extremely sexy!tom has many better movies.
I:8873;5;i honestly dont know how you can stand to be yourself if you'd make fun of something as serious and hurtful as autism.
I:8873;6;I've loved this movie since I was a child.
I:8873;7;My son saw it recently (he's 12) and he loves it as well.
I:8873;8;Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job!
I:8873;9;The savant Raymond is probably in the top five, best performances in film or stage, ever.
I:8873;10;Dustin Hoffman is outstanding, a talent in class by himself.
I:8873;11;"Actor Tom Cruise is becoming more and more an interesting fixture on the American media scene
I:8873;12;True freak of natural capacity somewhere in them.
I:8873;13;It has a great cast .
I:8873;14;And once we ignore the cliched 'a road trip is a metaphore for emotional journey' and 'at first I wanted the money, now I want my brother', the message is nicely laid out.
I:8873;15;This is one of Dustin Hoffman's best roles ever.
I:8873;16;Rain Man starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman won many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor for Hoffman.
I:8873;17;Hoffman's performance is pretty amazing but I felt Cruise should've won too, I never thought of Cruise as an actor with incredible range but he is flawless in this film.
I:8873;18;Good film even after all these years, enjoy!
I:8873;19;viewing it the way audiences may have seen it in theaters .
I:8873;20;"is ""Rain Man"" that wonderful of a film, or we just all taken."
I:8873;21;aback by the intense performance by Dustin Hoffman?
I:8873;22;Hoffman deserved the Oscar for this film, but again, looking back .
I:8873;23;video markets, but with Hoffman and Cruise headlining, there is more of a mass appeal.
I:8873;24;For the first moment that we see him, he is this fast.
I:8873;25;our film changes from this family plight to this road movie .
I:8873;26;going all over our great nation to demonstrate brotherly love.
I:8873;27;We are glued to Hoffman on the screen, and thus Cruise can get away with anything (slipping in and out of character within scenes) because are eyes are focused on one man, and one man only.
I:8873;28;There is so much that I like about him as a director and there are moments in this film that he pulls your heartstrings hard .
I:8873;29;and with the greatest of ease.
I:8873;30;leading moments, but instead he pulls the rug and gives us honesty and truth.
I:8873;31;I appreciated that and adored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work.
I:8873;32;Hoffman's performance kept the over two hours worth the viewing, but I don't think I could watch this again.
I:8873;33;Rain Man is a mediocre film fueled by one great performance.
I:8873;34;Rain Man did sweep the Oscars that year, giving everyone that feeling of joy .
I:8873;35;This story is as funny/sad/important/wonderful as I remember.
I:8873;36;Tom Cruise did his best bit of real acting in this movie.
I:8873;37;Perfect pairing with Cruise and Hoffman.
I:8873;38;The movie deserved every award it won.
I:8873;39;Will be a classic for many decades.
I:8873;40;Definitely recommend watching if you are 16 and over.
I:8873;41;Comment: This is one of those movies that you kind of stumble into.
I:8873;42;You see on the box that it is associated with 4 Academy Awards.
I:8873;43;just a good story about brothers.
I:8873;44;A GOOD story about brothers, enjoy.
I:8873;45;This is a good movie for anyone who does not understand autism.
I:8873;46;It is shown in a compassionate way and will help people assist someone with this problem.
I:8873;47;dustin hoffman is great in this one.
I:8873;48;this was my first time watching this movie and I loved it.
I:8873;49;I found it hilarious as well on certain parts.
I:8873;50;Dustin did a great job playing that role.
I:8873;51;One of my favorites of all times.
I:8873;52;Will probably watch it again some day.
I:8873;53;This kind of movie is a REAL movie!
I:8873;54;, This kind of movie has the real meat and potatoes of life!
I:8873;55;Tom Cruise in one of his more emotional roles and Dustin Hoffman giving one of his best performances ever.
I:8873;56;i watched this recently with my macho 16 year old son and even he sat riveted to the set and was moved close to tears by this touching road trip .
I:8873;57;Hoffman portrayed an Autistic man superbly.
I:8873;58;It is amazing that 25 years later there has been more awareness.
I:8873;59;Nothing about autism is funny.
I:8873;60;This is a great movie.
I:8873;61;It brings me to tears every time I watch it.
I:8873;62;`Rain Man' is an easy film to love.
I:8873;63;From that angle, the film can be delightful.
I:8873;64;It sports some fine performances (both Cruise and Hoffman are effective, Cruise actually developing more character than Hoffman, who isn't asked to do much) but other than that the film rests in the middle, giving us mundane in a semi.
I:8873;65;I must admit he is a superb mathemetician.
I:8873;66;He has difficulty communicating and learning.
I:8873;67;They play blackjack and win a lot of money.
I:8873;68;In one of the final scenes,a private hearing takes place regarding Raymond.
I:8873;69;Levinson took home a Best Director Oscar,Hoffman took home a Best Actor Oscar,and best screenplay.
I:8873;70;The story, best Oscar film in 1988 or 1989 is very touching.
I:8873;71;The story of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt, one a rich yuppie with a hot Italian girlfriend, and the other a simple, honest idiot savant.
I:8873;72;is one of Hollywood's finest films of it's kind.
I:8873;73;Boosted by excellent cinematography and Hans Zimmer's first Hollywood score (and it is incredible), not to mention Cruise's slick performance and a stunning, Oscar winning role by Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;74;The movie speaks for itself.
I:8873;75;Very easy to use and free with Prime.
I:8873;76;This was a huge hit in the day, and some of the scenes are still great.
I:8873;77;I was able to watch the whole thing.
I:8873;78;Rain Man (Raymond) is a movie that is both entertaining and serious at the same time.
I:8873;79;it is a wonderfully executed movie with star.
I:8873;80;studded performances by both Hoffman and Cruise, that makes you laugh at times and feel a lump in your throat at other times.
I:8873;81;Very touching and shows how we need to have compassion for everyone.
I:8873;82;Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as the high.
I:8873;83;what happens along the way is both funny and sad, but the upshot is the brothers get to know one another.
I:8873;84;Raymond gets to have some experiences he would never have had at the hospital, but eventually Charlie recognizes what's best for Raymond and allows the doctor to take him home to the hospital.
I:8873;85;dustin Hoffman does a brilliant job of portraying Raymond, which is a boon to those who have autism in their families, and would rather people had a positive image to promote compassion.
I:8873;86;That is, compassion for the autistic individual and for the family members who must find ways to cope with their needs.
I:8873;87;I watched this because it looked like a good movie.
I:8873;88;What I got was a great movie!!!
I:8873;89;The ending really touched me and gets into your real self.
I:8873;90;This was reportedly one of princess Diana's favorite movies to watch.
I:8873;91;YOu have to have a heart to enjoy this movie.
I:8873;92;I rate this movie 8/10.
I:8873;93;Dustin Hoffman nails his character of an autistic brother of the always interesting Cruise.
I:8873;94;Hoffman got the Oscar for this performance.
I:8873;95;The movie is touching, but also funny.
I:8873;96;This scene is very funny, really funny.
I:8873;97;Also, when Hoffman wants 8 pieces of fish (instead of 4), Cruise finds a very easy and funny way to work that out.
I:8873;98;"Hoffman, besides being an ""excellent driver"", can ""gamble"" really good."
I:8873;99;it's a really good movie, very entertaining, and very interesting.
I:8873;100;Very inspiring in that sense too.
I:8873;101;'Rain Man' is the kind of film where we know we are watching a formula movie, but we are so enraptured by the story and the premise and captivated by the brilliant performances by Cruise and Hoffman that we can't help but let ourselves go and fully enjoy what this unique film has to offer.
I:8873;102;Taut direction by Levinson and a well written screenplay also helps.
I:8873;103;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 9!
I:8873;104;"Exciting, dramatic, emotional, funny and no clue as to resolution
I:8873;105;There is an overarching theme of the sins of the father and how they may be overcome.
I:8873;106;This was a fantastic movie.
I:8873;107;Dustin Hoffman has earned a whole new level of respect from me.
I:8873;108;His acting was incredible, and the storyline was well developed.
I:8873;109;Despite being somewhat of a drama film Rain Man is one of the most entertaining films of all time.
I:8873;110;headed salesman perfectly and Dustin Hoffman is outstanding as the autistic brother he never knew he had.
I:8873;111;Rain Man successfully combines hunmor and drama and is a meaningful experience.
I:8873;112;The effects of Cruise's character's poor relationship with his father is portrayed well, and this type of relationship betweeen fathers and sons is all to common in real life.
I:8873;113;the quirks, habits, routines, and great memory.
I:8873;114;He does a magnificent job, too.
I:8873;115;It's wonderful to see him work, and Cruise, who grows to love Raymond (though he loses him back to the institution again), is excellent too as a self.
I:8873;116;The movie is based on a true story (with some falsities added in).
I:8873;117;Dustin Hoffman portrayed his character with perfection and even was able to mimic some of the smaller ticks beautifully!
I:8873;118;Tom Cruise plays a terrific jerk who pulls it together and becomes the loving brother Raymond needs.
I:8873;119;I highly recommend the movie and seller.
I:8873;120;Received this movie right on time, it was in good shape and I was very pleased!
I:8873;121;This is a great movie.
I:8873;122;Dustin Hoffman's character is so sweet.
I:8873;123;I had been looking for this every where and found it on Amazon for a pretty good price.
I:8873;124;Shipping was fast and accurate as usual!
I:8873;125;time hasn't changed this movie still a great movie with two great actors I give it now what I gave it then 4 starsfor those of a newer generation goooo see it
I:8873;126;A great movie but mediocre special edition.
I:8873;127;A Great movie with great acting but I honestly don't think this should be called a special edition because you slap on a few commentaries a quick deleted scene and an old 7 minute promowhatchamacallit.
I:8873;128;A great movie with outstanding acting, especially by Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;129;Worth watching again after 25 years.
I:8873;130;A great one is LAST WORD about a social misfit who writes poetic suicide notes for other people for money.
I:8873;131;Dustin Hoffman is just great on this one.
I:8873;132;Great Duet with a young Cruise.
I:8873;133;Worth the time to watch it.
I:8873;134;Forgot how much I loved this movie.
I:8873;135;It is one of those that no matter how many times you see it, you enjoy it.
I:8873;136;everything about this classic movie is great.
I:8873;137;direction,screenplay, casting, background score to name a few.
I:8873;138;In the last few years, this was one of the few Oscar winners for best picture that was not a ponderous three hour history lesson.
I:8873;139;Charlie takes Raymond on a drive back to L. a. to await a hearing on custody of Raymond, and the film is, in effect, their cross country journey.
I:8873;140;He is very confident and sure of himself, and holds his own against Hoffman.
I:8873;141;Even at the climactic hearing, he speaks shortly to Raymond, and their final scene after the hearing, where Raymond leans his head on Charlie's, is wonderful.
I:8873;142;hoffman deserved the Oscar for best actor.
I:8873;143;the screenplay is wonderful, despite a troubled history and multiple endings.
I:8873;144;Levinson uses overlapping dialogue to a wonderful extent, with Cruise always talking and trying to find a way out of a jam.
I:8873;145;His scene where he keeps repeating his inheritance, the rose bushes, to his father's lawyer, while the lawyer tries to talk, is funny and a foreshadowing to Hoffman's Raymond.
I:8873;146;Here, it is very natural.
I:8873;147;hans Zimmer provides an incredible score that is not used often enough.
I:8873;148;Rain Man is a great film, and one that deserves a fresh look today.
I:8873;149;this is rated (R) for some physical violence, strong profanity, brief female nudity, some sexual content, and some sexual references.
I:8873;150;He did an excellent job on this character.
I:8873;151;Gotta love him in this movie.
I:8873;152;I highly recommend watching Rain Man if you enjoy experiencing a wide range of emotions.
I:8873;153;Had to watch it for a class, but it was worth it.
I:8873;154;tom Cruise was kinda sexy in 88.
I:8873;155;loved this when it first came out, still loveit.
I:8873;156;Classic Both main actors are fantastic will see it again no doubt
I:8873;157;And I think he deserved it .
I:8873;158;he gave a great performance as the most complex character he's ever shown onscreen, the sleazy Los Angelino Charlie Babbitt.
I:8873;159;Eyes Wide Shut, Collateral, and all of the rest don't even come close.
I:8873;160;I think it's a believable premise that's executed brilliantly.
I:8873;161;Rain Man deserved its accolades and is an exemplary film on many levels.
I:8873;162;It's a much better film than Steven Spielberg or many other Hollywood A. listers has ever made.
I:8873;163;Hans Zimmer did an amazing job as well .
I:8873;164;A classic must see about what we think matters in life and what once we discover and learn really matters.
I:8873;165;Hoffman and Cruise were at their very finest acting in this one.
I:8873;166;This is a great movie to have!!
I:8873;167;I would recommend this to anyone in the world.
I:8873;168;I loved this movie when it cam out ands still think it is one of the best movies!
I:8873;169;In a psychiatrist office Charlie learns about Raymonds ability's with numbers.
I:8873;170;i chose to watch this movie because Ray reminded me of friends I have.
I:8873;171;I feel Rain Man is one of the most important films in history.
I:8873;172;That is all thanks to Rain Man, a great movie.
I:8873;173;i would recommend this movie to anyone that has a sense of humor and would not find it offensive to laugh at a person with a disability.
I:8873;174;I laughed, cried, and identified with all the characters!
I:8873;175;It is both educational and entertaining.
I:8873;176;If you have never seen, it is a must watch.
I:8873;177;Several recent movies have also shown men and fathers in a much more humane light.
I:8873;178;"The Academy Award winning ""Rain Man"" though publicized in a way which seemed a deliberate attempt to make certain that it did not appeal to men, is actually a very interesting story about two brothers."
I:8873;179;Dad would enjoy this movie.
I:8873;180;Great movie, a must see!
I:8873;181;Excellent acting by both main characters.
I:8873;182;A movie that will truly speak to you in many ways, `Rain Man' hits all the right chords over and over again.
I:8873;183;As Raymond Babbitt, Dustin Hoffman truly deserved that Oscar for he evokes so much emotion from the viewer it's almost impossible to keep from tearing up.
I:8873;184;there are two scenes in particular that really got me, both involving a dance.
I:8873;185;so, in closing, `Rain Man' is a movie that is meant to inspire, to move and compel others to open there hearts, and to that effect it truly works.
I:8873;186;peeve with this film is that at the end when his brother is on the bus Charlie doesn't TELL him that he loves him) and that transformation is just so emotionally moving.
I:8873;187;Thanks in a large way to Dustin Hoffman's brilliant Oscar winning performance, and even to Tom Cruise's development of character (I will admit he was convincing as a jerk who leant a lesson, as much as I despise him) `Rain Man' pays off in the end as a wonderful cinematic experience that EVERYONE should and can enjoy!
I:8873;188;It was one of my late father's favorite movies, and I nowimitate Raymond's peculiarities the way he did.
I:8873;189;It's also a movie about driving across America which has a romance all its' own.
I:8873;190;did it desearve 4 oscars and best picture.
I:8873;191;lined drive of the institution from which Charlie was springing his autistic brother, and in its stead appeared a country road underfoot and a beautiful blue sky towering above them, stretching forever and ever.
I:8873;192;films communicate their stories through the metaphors they contain.
I:8873;193;Once you can understand the metaphors, you can understand the movie.
I:8873;194;By realizing that autism is the vehicle and Charlie's change is the tenor, we can finally get the story's meaning the right way around.
I:8873;195;Most films' appeal is a character with strong emotions who changes.
I:8873;196;The main metaphor is autism, more than the car or even the journey.
I:8873;197;Ray's immutability is the yardstick that allows us to savor all the more Charlie's transformation into a feeling human being.
I:8873;198;And we hope that if we could just give them enough love they might somehow be released from their condition.
I:8873;199;And a brilliantly controlled performance by Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;200;This script plays out very nicely, as we are drawn into the world of Raymond and Charlie Babbitt and their cross.
I:8873;201;This is a film to watch and enjoy over and over again!
I:8873;202;It MUST be viewed more than just once!
I:8873;203;And remember to fly Qantas whenever possible.
I:8873;204;Along the way, there were some scenes that showed remarkable detail.
I:8873;205;Truly worthy of the best picture Oscar.
I:8873;206;Great tale of discovery and maturation with humor peppered throughout.
I:8873;207;Very touching, love the relationship between Dustin and Tom.
I:8873;208;A classic for all time.
I:8873;209;One of Dustin's best acting jobs.
I:8873;210;But it all comes together in the end.
I:8873;211;Tom Cruize and Dustin Hoffman both did outstanding work in this movie!!
I:8873;212;One of my all time favorite movies!!
I:8873;213;This one is a classic and so good!
I:8873;214;It's such a touching story with lots of does of humor throughout.
I:8873;215;Getting it as a special edition was a plus!
I:8873;216;this movie will make you cry and make you laugh.
I:8873;217;Tom Cruise and Dustan Hoffman are the ones that make this movie so good.
I:8873;218;Dustin Hoffman is absolutely perfect in this movie.
I:8873;219;His portrayal of an autistic savant is spot.
I:8873;220;on and is entirely believable.
I:8873;221;Though Tom Cruise's character is less likable initially, he does a great job portraying the confusing nature of the situation.
I:8873;222;This is one of those movies that everyone must see.
I:8873;223;It leaves you both laughing and crying.
I:8873;224;A great job of collaboration!!
I:8873;225;Thanks so much for having it in stock!
I:8873;226;Barry Levinson's name is well.
I:8873;227;known these days mostly as a producer but he has directed a good number of films that people are familiar with.
I:8873;228;"the film which was budgeted at $25 million, earned over $354 million (the film was the highest grossing film of 1988) and would win four Academy awards including ""Best Director"", ""Best Picture"", ""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"" and a ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" for Dustin Hoffman."
I:8873;229;"While for ""Rain Man"", the film does show its age in terms of film stock used, this is the best looking version of the film to date."
I:8873;230;there is a good amount of grain in this film but there is much more detail and edge enhancement can be seen at times.
I:8873;231;If anything, the clarity and detail is much more evident in the Blu.
I:8873;232;"otherwise, if you love the film, ""Rain Man"" on Blu."
I:8873;233;driven film, it also sports a solid musical soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.
I:8873;234;If anything, you do hear some ambiance at times but for the most part, this is a center and front.
I:8873;235;You do get a scene where you watch Charlie and Raymond driving through a bridge and you can hear the wheels going over the bridge and sound coming through the surround channels but this is pretty much a dialogue.
I:8873;236;"(22:07) A featurette on the making of ""Rain Man"" and features interviews with director Barry Levinson and writers Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass."
I:8873;237;what I enjoyed about the film is the fact that you get to see Charlie's arrogance directed towards his brother and to see this character change as he becomes more acquainted with his brother.
I:8873;238;While some may feel the character of Charlie to be repulsive or overly cocky, the performance by Dustin Hoffman is magnificent.
I:8873;239;The timing of the words and the motions that went into Raymond's character was well.
I:8873;240;done by Hoffman and I enjoyed how the conflict begins at the beginning and slowly works itself towards the end.
I:8873;241;climactic but for what it's worth, I did not want to see a mushy ending.
I:8873;242;The ending fits right with Charlie Babbage and everything worked out.
I:8873;243;"overall, ""Rain Man"" is still an enjoyable film over 20."
I:8873;244;"So, if you enjoyed ""Rain Man"" a lot, then I definitely recommend upgrading to Blu."
I:8873;245;The screenplay, the acting, the message .
I:8873;246;it's all brilliant!So many movies age and are disappointing to view after a while but this is a wonderful example of an ageless classic.
I:8873;247;This was an interesting movie.
I:8873;248;I really liked the way they bonded after a few days of hanging out.
I:8873;249;Funny, and sad at the same time.
I:8873;250;This is a great movie, and great acting by Hoffman and Cruise.
I:8873;251;I don't like Tom Cruise too much, but he did a great job in this movie.
I:8873;252;Hoffman is clearly one of America's greatest actors!
I:8873;253;"where every single scene in which they interact makes you go, ""Wow!"""
I:8873;254;I've seen this movie several times (and hope to see it several times more) and walk away with a new appreciation for what Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman were able to accomplish with each viewing.
I:8873;255;Again, this is a journey of discovery, and it is Charlie who discovers some very important things. . . about himself.
I:8873;256;Hoffman and Cruise gave masterpiece performances, and RAIN MAN deserved all the accolades and awards it received.
I:8873;257;If you haven't seen this movie, please, please do so.
I:8873;258;very touching tale of lost love, and heart wrenching compassion for a condition not well known even today.
I:8873;259;Dustins character interpretation is abs olutely flawless and incomparable.
I:8873;260;This is a very Good all around movie.
I:8873;261;I really loved this movie as much this time as the last time I saw it in the theater thanks for making it available.
I:8873;262;This is actually excellent movie.
I:8873;263;I think every family should watch this movie Dustin Hoffman played this so well.
I:8873;264;It's funny, heartbreaking, tender and complex!
I:8873;265;I can see why it won 4 academy awards including best picture
I:8873;266;We also see how a genuine bond develops between Charlie and RaymondFor the most part this is a very serious and poignant movie, although there are some humorous scenes, such as when Raymond counts cards for Charlie at a blackjack table in a Las Vegas casino and wins for him $40,000 in a single evening of play.
I:8873;267;moving movie and is a believable portrayal of autism.
I:8873;268;Both Tom Cruise (Charlie) and Dustin Hoffman (Raymond) do an excellent job of acting their respective characters.
I:8873;269;You'll laugh and cry watching this movie.
I:8873;270;I enjoyed the movie and thought the story and acting were great.
I:8873;271;It is one of the best movies of the 1980s', and it has without doubt, one of the best performances ever seen on film.
I:8873;272;He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly.
I:8873;273;Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen.
I:8873;274;It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in.
I:8873;275;This is a film to be cherished for generations.
I:8873;276;I highly recommend Rain Man.
I:8873;277;The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor(very well deserved!)
I:8873;278;, and Tom Cruise are outstanding.
I:8873;279;I believe this to be one of the first films that Cruise had a real substantial character with depth to him.
I:8873;280;This is an excellent story of greed revenge and the power of brotherly love winning out over all.
I:8873;281;personally never seen it but it arrived quick and in great condition.
I:8873;282;A man who thought he had everything learns he has a brother after his father's death and kidnaps his brother to get his brother's share of the inheritance but has a change of heart after he gets to know his brother.
I:8873;283;This is one of our favorite movies.
I:8873;284;Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman did an amazing job in this show.
I:8873;285;"Very funny and heartwarming movie about a ""special"" condition, one told with great grace and learning is not low in this movie."
I:8873;286;tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman are great in this movie of two brothers who just met, one with a very short temper and one with a pretty unique view of life through a mental illness.
I:8873;287;An old movie that is worth watching again.
I:8873;288;Dustin Hoffman is wonderfully talented as the savant and Tom Cruise plays his best role ever.
I:8873;289;Both were great in this movie.
I:8873;290;Barry Levinson has proven again what a fine director he is.
I:8873;291;rAIN MAN delivers quite a punch as a human drama and sort of a buddy picture, with some humorous moments.
I:8873;292;tom Cruise is excellent in this movie.
I:8873;293;Dustin Hoffman is great too.
I:8873;294;The reason why I found this film is so enormously moving and tremendously satisfying is that at one moment Dustin Hoffman's behavior pulled out laughter from me, and at the next moment, or even the same moment, my awareness of his mental illness pulled out tears.
I:8873;295;ray rivals that of VHS.
I:8873;296;otherwise, the movie itself is great.
I:8873;297;This is a timeless movie that I enjoyed and remembered from many years ago.
I:8873;298;I enjoyed sharing it with my Granddaughter and her husband (In their 20's).
I:8873;299;They loved the movie and we all enjoyed the conversations it sparked about relationships.
I:8873;300;excellent back in it's day and even now after 25 years it's still worth watching at least once a year.
I:8873;301;Great character development in Charlie Babbit.
I:8873;302;Excellent portrayal of autism in Raymond Babbit.
I:8873;303;Tom Cruise is at his best here.
I:8873;304;Dustin Hoffman is a great actor as the Rain Man, and demonstrates incredibly well how an autistic person reacts towards certain things as well as changes in his routine life.
I:8873;305;He captures autism in such a way that you could actually believe in his performance.
I:8873;306;tom Cruise's role (Charlie Babbitt) was equally as brilliant, who is the villain of the story who undergoes such a sharp change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end.
I:8873;307;furthermore, the directing of the film was beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done.
I:8873;308;"I also believe that ""Rain Man"" portrays many aspects of autism quite well."
I:8873;309;The movie is an introduction to autism for most people who see it for the first time.
I:8873;310;The two begin a long road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other, and I believe that this trip across the country was the start in the relationship between the two brothers.
I:8873;311;this movie was very emotional at some times, and had it's funny moments as well.
I:8873;312;"I believe that ""Rain Man"" is truly a work of art, and a film that everyone can watch, understand, and enjoy."
I:8873;313;Dustin Hoffman plays a superb role as the autistic brother of Tom Cruise in this heartwarming and touching video of two brothers coming to terms with the existence of each other that was unknown up until the death of their father.
I:8873;314;One of my favorite movies.
I:8873;315;great performances by Dustin Hoffman,who plays Raymond,a servant with a gift for numbers,and his brother,Charlie,Tom Cruise.
I:8873;316;charlie finds out after 30 years that he has a special brother who is in a home caring for his special needs.
I:8873;317;the movie shows the very special challenges this creates for Charlie,and the special bond that is created when Charlie finally finds what a very wonderful person Raymond is.
I:8873;318;very unusual in light of some of their recent efforts.
I:8873;319;I've enjoyed this movie since the first time I watched it many years ago.
I:8873;320;Great mix of tenderness, comedy, and genius.
I:8873;321;Dustin Hoffman did a brilliant job in his role.
I:8873;322;"An outstanding movie from the eighties that took four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Actor), ""Rainman"" is about the arrogant, selfish and materialistic hotshot car."
I:8873;323;Charlie takes up contact with Raymond, and because his real motive is to obtain his dad's millions, he kidnaps Ray and holds him for ransom.
I:8873;324;Charlie comes to realize that Ray's brilliant memory and extraordinary ability with numbers has great potential in a casino.
I:8873;325;Their journey on the run is as much a journey of discovery for Charlie as it is for Ray.
I:8873;326;"Charlie undergoes a dramatic transformation in character: ""I felt like giving you a hug."""
I:8873;327;"but ""Rainman"" is also a sensitive look at people with mental disabilities, showing their strengths and weaknesses, and showing how they are as loveable as the rest of us."
I:8873;328;This is heightened by some brilliant acting from Dustin Hoffman in particular, who produced an outstanding and convincing performance as autistic Raymond.
I:8873;329;Hoffman's Academy Award winning performance is enhanced by a brilliant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and stellar directing which makes you see life from Raymond's autistic point of view (for instance his bewilderment as they drive across a bridge).
I:8873;330;there are also several delightful moments of warm humor .
I:8873;331;But if you can overlook the excessive amount of offensive content, this is a memorable movie that has the potential to change you as it changed Charlie .
I:8873;332;The members of our family (even those with handicaps) are truly of more value than the money in our bank.
I:8873;333;I love Dustin Hoffman in this classic movie.
I:8873;334;If you have never seen Rain Man, it is worth watching.
I:8873;335;This is a great film.
I:8873;336;Dustin Hoffman delivers a performance worthy of the many accolades he received.
I:8873;337;He is simply unforgettable as his role of Raymond.
I:8873;338;He immerses himself into the character, and is completely believable.
I:8873;339;Tom Cruise is quite good also, and even refrains from his usual fits of over.
I:8873;340;He gives a fairly restrained performance, and his character 'softens up' nicely at the end of the film.
I:8873;341;Always fun to watch, Rain Man is a film that should be seen more than once.
I:8873;342;Impecable performance by Dusitn Hoffman.
I:8873;343;Tom Cruise shows his greatness again.
I:8873;344;In 1988 this film won 4 Academy Awards .
I:8873;345;Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay.
I:8873;346;The growing love and connection between the two brothers, who were separated through no fault of their own, is moving and touching.
I:8873;347;Also, to see the extraordinary abilities of an autistic savant is just amazing.
I:8873;348;In the film the music is outstanding and some of the scenery in the Western USA is just great.
I:8873;349;This is a movie that you can see again and again.
I:8873;350;The story is well developed and captivating.
I:8873;351;This is a pretty good movies, sometimes funny, sometimes sad with great acting by Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise also.
I:8873;352;A film for all the family.
I:8873;353;A good lessons about values in life.
I:8873;354;The story is very unique, great that made this movie win an oscar, but the main thing is the acting Hoffman produces which is so real, so touching, that it made this movie so believeable, not just a shelf throw back.
I:8873;355;Really enjoyed watching this older movie.
I:8873;356;Dustin Hoffman did an incredible job.
I:8873;357;Tom Cruise was type casted very well.
I:8873;358;It is a heartwarming movie.
I:8873;359;Acting from both actors is superb.
I:8873;360;Love the story line and how it was develop.
I:8873;361;Great acting by both guys.
I:8873;362;The movie story is simple yet attractive.
I:8873;363;Overall a great movie thanks to the two actors!!
I:8873;364;Wonderful movie Oscar winner, well deserved award winning film
I:8873;365;this is one of the finest movies out there about brotherhood and family .
I:8873;366;One of the Best Pictures that actually deserved the Oscar.
I:8873;367;hoffman is at his best!
I:8873;368;Now he is absolutely believable, I didnt think for one second that he was puting on an act and thats the way it should be.
I:8873;369;funny enough as it might seem it is Cruise that holds the film together.
I:8873;370;His character development is impressive and surprising.
I:8873;371;such a great movie to watch, with one exeption, with the whole family.
I:8873;372;It was an amazing movie!!!!
I:8873;373;I use it in my psychology class when we discuss certain personality themes especially the humanistic theory and we focus on self actualization
I:8873;374;I wanted my 14 year old to see it and It always delivers.
I:8873;375;Tom Cruise was excellent and what can you say about Dustin Hoffman's performance .
I:8873;376;rAIN MAN won several Academy Awards for this touching portrayal of two brothers coming to terms with each other.
I:8873;377;Dustin Hoffman was Best Actor for his role as Raymond.
I:8873;378;Hoffman shows his amazing talents and clearly deserved his Best Actor award.
I:8873;379;There is a true beauty in this film as we see Charlie grow and mature in front of our eyes.
I:8873;380;A nurturing instinct is slowly arises as he develops a clear affection for his brother Raymond.
I:8873;381;it's a bittersweet and heartwarming story to watch.
I:8873;382;Though he will have to go back to the institution, his brother will keep the possibility to meet him and take him under his responsibility regularly.
I:8873;383;This is still somewhat behind our present time, but it was a tremendous revolution in our way of thinking nearly twenty years ago.
I:8873;384;Two great actors Tom Cruise as the brother and Dustin Hoffman as the autistic son.
I:8873;385;I've seen this for the third time and still enjoyed every moment.
I:8873;386;I would think this role would be very difficult to pull off but Hoffman is very convincing!
I:8873;387;Dustin Hoffman has created an inspiration for me.
I:8873;388;"Because I have a rare Autistic Spectrum knownas ""Asperger's Syndrome"" and my abilities are similar to Raymond's in terms of math,games(Video Games+Yu."
I:8873;389;Therefore,being that I have such a rare Autistic Spectum.
I:8873;390;Watched it for the first time in 20 years.
I:8873;391;Cruise and Hoffman are both incredible in this movie.
I:8873;392;The supplier did a wonderful job in shipping it a satistfactory time.
I:8873;393;This is a great movie with two excellent actors, you will not be disappointed.
I:8873;394;Definitely, definitely, recommend yeah, definitely recommend.
I:8873;395;Rain Man is one of those rare films that is equally touching and moving as it is humorous.
I:8873;396;A true labor of love for those involved, particularly its producers, director Barry Levinson, and star Dustin Hoffman, it remains an undated and compelling work, since its release sixteen years ago.
I:8873;397;on portrayal of an autistic savant, winning an Oscar in the process.
I:8873;398;His is a very underrated performance, one that reminds how accomplished an actor he can be when given the right dramatic role.
I:8873;399;Equally good is Levinson's direction, smartly exposing the humor on what could normally be viewed as overly sentimental material.
I:8873;400;In the end, the greatest strength of this package is the movie itself.
I:8873;401;Whether it was indeed the best film of 1988 is a point of debate.
I:8873;402;Absolutely wonderful acting, great storyline, fantastic plot.
I:8873;403;A great movie, watched with the entire family, all enjoyed immensely.
I:8873;404;Very funny in parts yet very educational also.
I:8873;405;Charlie (Tom Cruise) and Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) do an excellent job of acting in this movie.
I:8873;406;Even though Charlie loses his patience's a lot with Raymond, they learn very valuable lessons of life.
I:8873;407;This is a must see movie that portrays the many trials and tribulations that are solved by two brother's unconditional love.
I:8873;408;A great film,love every minute of it.
I:8873;409;dustin Hoffman always seems to make me smile and laugh through the portrayal of his character.
I:8873;410;the movie it's self looks great in blu ray,the sound is crystal clear.
I:8873;411;the deleted scene was funny!
I:8873;412;it's a long movie but so worth the money.
I:8873;413;Along the way they use Hoffman's incredible math skills to win $ 80,000 in Las Vegas, and Cruise is beginning to understand that Hoffman is a true genius in some ways, a helpless panic during crises.
I:8873;414;i just loved this movie.
I:8873;415;Best movie portrayal of autism yet.
I:8873;416;Tom Cruise's best ever performance.
I:8873;417;Dustin Hoffman's best ever performance.
I:8873;418;Would recommend this movie to anyone as it is both entertaining and educational.
I:8873;419;This movie is a classic.
I:8873;420;I am so happy to have it on my Kindle so I can watch it anytime I want.
I:8873;421;This movie had some really good acting by Cruise and Hoffman.
I:8873;422;I give this movie a 5/5 for good acting, accurate representation, and an interesting storyline.
I:8873;423;Cruz is surprisingly sensitive and Hoffman is just amazing!!
I:8873;424;For all matters of story line, script writing, photography, acting, and such, it is a perfectly fine movie.
I:8873;425;But it is primarily entertainment, as opposed to being a documentary about autism spectrum disorders.
I:8873;426;The previous release, that is now out of print, contained both full screen and widescreen format to view.
I:8873;427;I guess for the Special edition you should have a special TV, like a widescreen 40inch plasma screen and call it theatre.
I:8873;428;kilter road picture is also genuinely moving, offering a warm.
I:8873;429;hearted, humane look at disability.
I:8873;430;The actor is totally credible as an idiot savant with unexpected life lessons to impart to his younger brother, and this bravura performance earned Hoffman yet another Oscar, while the movie itself won for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay.
I:8873;431;Amazon had the best price and delivered within 5 business days, even during the holiday season.
I:8873;432;Dustin Hoffman's acting was exceptional.
I:8873;433;I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well written and well acted movies.
I:8873;434;One of the great movies of our time.
I:8873;435;Dustin hoffman and Tom cruise make a great pair in this movie.
I:8873;436;That is why it is so well know.
I:8873;437;Hoffman and Cruis are perfectly cast, believable, touching.
I:8873;438;Everybody should see this at least once.
I:8873;439;Rain Man is a very touching movie, Dustin Hoffman does a great job as do tom Cruise.
I:8873;440;anyhow, you have to see the movie.
I:8873;441;The Movie Features A Beautiful 49' Yellow Buick Roadmaster Roadster in most of the movie, and In the beginning we learn Cruise' Character is an Importer For Lamborghini.
I:8873;442;It is a really good movie.
I:8873;443;This is a classic movie that everyone should watch at least once!!
I:8873;444;it is an excellent movie!
I:8873;445;Great characters and believable acting.
I:8873;446;The portrayal of autism is done respectfully and while it might be misunderstood by some characters, eventually it brings everyone together.
I:8873;447;Great actors for both men, good story about family.
I:8873;448;My mom watched it and said, this shows you that your family is all you have in life, so cherish it.
I:8873;449;Rain Man is a classic movie.
I:8873;450;must admit my surprise that he absolutely loves it.
I:8873;451;this is a reality show that features an amazing autistic young man named Chad.
I:8873;452;chad is our favorite part of watching the show.
I:8873;453;A timeless film, the performance of Dustin Hoffman it is just brilliant.
I:8873;454;I have always enjoyed the movie, now I can watch it whenever I want.
I:8873;455;After viewing this film numerous times, I finally decided I must own a copy.
I:8873;456;I just like watching his acting in this movie honestly more than anything.
I:8873;457;Hoffman and Cruise do an excellent job in this movie classic.
I:8873;458;i highly recommend this movie, you won't be dissapointed.
I:8873;459;It seems like for every worthy, challenging Academy Award.
I:8873;460;winning movie like AMERICAN BEAUTY there's something like RAIN MAN (which won four major Academy Awards in 1989): a safe, conservative, old.
I:8873;461;well, perhaps I'm being too cynical here.
I:8873;462;It's an entertaining and occasionally illuminating drama about how an initially selfish jerk (Tom Cruise) becomes a better person after he spends a lot of time on the road with his autistic.
I:8873;463;And the two performances by Hoffman and Cruise, really, are very good.
I:8873;464;As for Hoffman, who won an Oscar here, he obviously gives the more flashy performance, but he uncannily succeeds in drawing our sympathy for this wholly self.
I:8873;465;Overall, RAIN MAN is an enjoyable and sometimes genuinely touching movie about a man's change of heart.
I:8873;466;Raymond Babbitt is a subject that could have made a truly remarkable, shattering cinematic exploration about how autism affects its victim and/or people around him, and what do these filmmakers do instead?

I:8873;468;The filmmakers blew an opportunity to truly make us understand autism and how it affects people.
I:8873;469;look, I am perfectly capable of being truly moved by this kind of uplifting drama.
I:8873;470;and it was truly touching to boot.)
I:8873;471;I'm sure a lot of people will watch this movie and love it on its own rather un.

I:8873;502;This movie is a classic.
I:8873;503;and is certainly a must watch.
I:8873;504;I am thrilled that Dustin Hoffman won the academy award for this master piece.
I:8873;505;I laugh from beginning to end.
I:8873;506;The acting in this movie is flawless, Dustin Hoffman is at the top of his game.
I:8873;507;Its the touching story of a man who finds out he has an autistic brother and how his relationship with him helps him learn how to look outside of his own selfish life and pursuits.
I:8873;508;Now I know why it won the Oscar for Best Picture and why Dustin Hoffman received an Oscar for best actor.
I:8873;509;One of the best movies ever.
I:8873;510;Now that our kids are getting older, we are introducing them to some of the classics, particularly movies that are often quoted in our family.
I:8873;511;Wanted to watch this movie that I watched as a kid.

I:8873;517;I loved this movie when it came out, but since I only owned the VCR tape, and our player is broken, I wanted my Granddaughter to see it, so I got it from you.
I:8873;518;I had bought this as a gift for a friend because I couldn't find it in any stores around here.
I:8873;519;I was a bit upset with the price, but I'll survive I guess.
I:8873;520;I have aways loved this movie and I can watch it time and time again.
I:8873;521;Great acting that will bring out alot of emotions.
I:8873;522;I suggested he watch Rain Man, it has funny moments and interesting look at how someone's life can change.
I:8873;523;After watching it again I got much more out of it.
I:8873;524;I have loved watching this movie again and again over the past twelve years.
I:8873;525;Dustin Hoffman is a genius in the film.
I:8873;526;The realism of autism brought out by Hoffman and the writers is spot on.
I:8873;527;I have a cousin who is an autistic savant, and the similarities are incredible .
I:8873;528;This is honestly a good film.
I:8873;529;Love the casting and acting in this pic, always have.
I:8873;530;Dustin Hoffman shows an amazing talent for method acting.

I:8873;532;i thought this was such a good movie and every part of it was great a good movie to see.
I:8873;533;Slow to get started but towards the latter part finally turns into an emotion stirring movie.
I:8873;534;Hoffman's portrayal as an autistic man is excellent.
I:8873;535;It's a heart felt story about how life is like for autistic people.
I:8873;536;I enjoyed every minute of watching Charlie and Raymond get to know each other.
I:8873;537;This is the best movie I have ever seen.
I:8873;538;Rain Man is a classic film with global appeal but certainly the one that propelled awareness of autism into the mainstream.
I:8873;539;Cruise and Hoffman are outstanding in this film and the story of the opportunistic and image conscious Cruise contrasted with the 'what you see is what you get' Hoffman is gorgeous.
I:8873;540;If you have never watched this movie, it is one that shall move you emotionally.

I:8873;549;Dustin Hoffman is so good in this, it has to be seen to be believed.
I:8873;550;this is not my favourite Tom Cruise performance, as he acts like a complete SOB in this, but it's great the way his character changes throughout the movie, and by the end, I like him a lot more.
I:8873;551;For the amount of time between the original release, and the special edition, they could have come up with a lot more.
I:8873;552;The cover is also not the most inventive of covers I've ever seen.
I:8873;553;i definitely, definitely, definitely, love this movie, and I do tend to get a bit teary by the end of it, because I think Ray should have been allowed to stay with Charlie.
I:8873;554;or bring tears to my eyes.
I:8873;555;What a wonderfully gifted actor Dustin Hoffman is
I:8873;556;Hadn't seen the movie for quite some time and I really enjoyed it.
I:8873;557;man), who in the end realizes that his often ignored brother is more important than his schemes.
I:8873;558;This is one of the best all time movies.
I:8873;559;It is a must see!!
I:8873;560;Dustin Hoffman is awesome as Raymond.
I:8873;561;This is not a new movie, but I enjoyed sharing it with my daughters.
I:8873;562;This is one of those movies that you end up throwing quotes from all the time in everyday life.
I:8873;563;Dustin Hoffman did an amazing job!
I:8873;564;Rain Man is a great, emotionally moving experience which everyone should see.
I:8873;565;I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and it still continues to move me everytime that I watch it.
I:8873;566;The performances by Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman will live forever in the hearts of those who have ever loved somebody so dearly as a brother.
I:8873;567;here (as usual) mathematical genius.
I:8873;568;What you're good at, you're good at, disabled or not.

I:8873;570;A Beautiful Mind) are almost certain to be disappointed.
I:8873;571;Can we please be a bit more realistic?
I:8873;572;Cruise and Hoffman are both so great in this movie.
I:8873;573;Gen X. Love love love love it
I:8873;574;I think it was harder for Hoffman to pull off playing a woman than an autistic savant, but this is a great film and another incredible performance by Hoffman.
I:8873;575;Tom Cruise in an early dramtic role stands toe to toe with Hoffman and does an excellent job as his self.
I:8873;576;It grows on you more with each viewing and has become one of my favorite films of all time.
I:8873;577;You will laugh again and again throughout this movie and find yourself repeating lines from it.
I:8873;578;I love, love, love this movie.
I:8873;579;So, it is true, there are people like Raymond.
I:8873;580;so, this is a love story in the making and a heroic one for that matter.
I:8873;581;It is a love story where two brothers win over obstacles (Raymond's autistic traits).
I:8873;582;I was really young when I first saw this movie, but it made me feel compassion for people with special needs around me, and made me a lot some sensitive to the subject of handicaps.
I:8873;583;tom Cruise was very good in this movie.
I:8873;584;it was worth the money.
I:8873;585;It's called the special edition which you have to admit is pretty hilarious.
I:8873;586;Cruise then takes Hoffman on a cross country roadtrip, where he bonds and finds love for this special person.
I:8873;587;A movie with some hilarious situations and some to make even the stone hearted teary eyed.
I:8873;588;One of the best acting performances I have ever been privalaged to have seen.
I:8873;589;A true film of the soul!
I:8873;590;A movie based on personal growth and love.
I:8873;591;Great acting by all those involved and has a great storyline that with make everyone fall in love with the movie.
I:8873;592;A must see for everyone.
I:8873;593;Raymond is autistic, and it is the coming together of the brothers that is the narrative of this film, which is highly engaging and entertaining, as they learn more about each other whilst travelling across America by car, to Charlie's home in California.
I:8873;594;This is the film that confirmed Tom Cruise as a highly capable drama actor, and Dustin Hoffman deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a leading role, for his superb performance as Raymond.
I:8873;595;It is an enlightening movie that will forever charm audiences.
I:8873;596;The moment this movie came out it was a classic, filled with humor and emotion plus a great plotline.
I:8873;597;In this movie, we see 2 brothers, one of them is not really normal, but he has kind of a special gift.
I:8873;598;With this special edition, I revisited the movie once again.
I:8873;599;One thing that stood out in my recent viewing is the incredibly sympathetic and accurate portrayal of autism.
I:8873;600;This is my all time favorite 80's movie.
I:8873;601;It continues to help me appreciate persons with disabilities in every area of life.
I:8873;602;I remember this movie being so good even though I saw it so long ago.
I:8873;603;Its touching and relates to my 5 year old who is Autistic.
I:8873;604;It's a great movie and it's fun to watch.
I:8873;605;Dustin Hoffman did a great job acting.
I:8873;606;ray should have a full frame aspect ratio.
I:8873;607;This movie brings out the best in both actors.
I:8873;608;But, no mistake, amazing the first time you see it.
I:8873;609;My daughter and I love it.
I:8873;610;I gave it to my daughter, and she was really happy.
I:8873;611;Rain man really captures the developmental disability, autism.
I:8873;612;I enjoyed seeing the bond grow between Tom cruises and Dustin Hoffmans character.
I:8873;613;I enjoyed every one of their interactions, with the practice sessions right before Vegas being among my favorite scenes.
I:8873;614;I also really liked Valeria Golino as Tom Cruise's girlfriend and I'm glad the filmmakers dropped their idea to make the character a blond from Malibu or somewhere like that.
I:8873;615;Having a foreign character like this woman only enhanced the plot.
I:8873;616;This film is sweet, touching, and enjoyable without ever overdoing anything.
I:8873;617;It's ending is sweet, but far from generically sweet.
I:8873;618;Congrats to the filmmakers on a job well done!
I:8873;619;Eventually, Charlie softens up and grows to care for his brother and gives in to his routines, but also helps Raymond break some of them.
I:8873;620;Dustin Hoffman won his second Best Actor Oscar for his role as Raymond and Tom Cruise gave his first serious and critically acclaimed performance as Charlie.
I:8873;621;The film won three other Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Barry Levinson and Best Original Screenplay for writers Ronald Bass Barry Morrow.
I:8873;622;The film can get a little tedious and cloying spots and while Mr. Hoffman's performance is clearly genuine and heart felt, but he sometimes falls into an almost cartoon character with his mannerisms.
I:8873;623;That being said, Rain Man is a highly entertaining film that will make you laugh and cry.
I:8873;624;Dustin Hoffman plays a very convincing role as a man with autism.
I:8873;625;And, Tom Cruise is always good.
I:8873;626;If you've never seen this movie, it definitely worth your time.
I:8873;627;She was skeptical at first, but really enjoyed it as well.
I:8873;628;watched again with my grandkids.
I:8873;629;good humor, easy to follow, top notch actors.
I:8873;630;Good character play and story .
I:8873;631;nice to see the development of the interaction of the two main characters and how they finish
I:8873;632;Rain Man is my favorite film ever.
I:8873;633;its touching, sweet, and mesmerizing.
I:8873;634;Dustin Hoffman gives the best performance of his career.
I:8873;635;he makes you love Raymond just like his brother does.
I:8873;636;which takes you on a journey that make the connection between movie and mind even more powerful.
I:8873;637;Also the sound makes this breathtaking score even greater.
I:8873;638;I recommend this movie to just about everyone I talk to.
I:8873;639;everyone in the world needs to see this movie, not just because its good entertainment, but because of the message and ideas in the story.
I:8873;640;Fast download and looked great.
I:8873;641;Definitely downloading movies to my kindle in the future!
I:8873;642;I think I bought it twice and was charged two times for a movie I never watched.
I:8873;643;They converse, in a fashion.
I:8873;644;Tom Cruise should have won an Oscar for his little brother character to the autistic older brother Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;645;A favorite movie of our whole family.
I:8873;646;The acting is excellent from Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;647;"With films like ""The Graduate"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Little Big Man"" (my favorite film of all."
I:8873;648;time), he just has a way with characterizations that make movies memorable.
I:8873;649;"And ""Rain Man"", a film about two brothers reunited after years of separation, Autism, and so much more, is no exception."
I:8873;650;Well deserved Oscars for Best Film and Actor of 1988.
I:8873;651;But the emotional rollercoaster of mood changes Mr. Cruise was called upon to portray, was just as worthy a performance in my opinion.
I:8873;652;His best work to date.
I:8873;653;"And so I ask once more
I:8873;654;great film making by director Barry Levinson.
I:8873;655;What a fun journey through every human emotion imaginable.
I:8873;656;Charlie kidnaps Raymond from his residential home and begins a long journey and discovery that will forever change both their lives.
I:8873;657;Rain Man is a completely moving, emotional, funny, and unforgettable movie.
I:8873;658;Dustin Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and plays his most memorable role as well as Tom Cruise, who gives a great performance that helped a lot in launching most of his career.
I:8873;659;The direction by Barry Levinson is stunning and of course, his best yet.
I:8873;660;Overall, the film is a timeless classic that moves me in every way.
I:8873;661;This is definitely one of the best films of the 80's and one of my all time favorites.
I:8873;662;I'm a big fan of Dustin Hoffman and the part he played in this movie was one of his best characters.
I:8873;663;I can watch this movie over and over and it still brings tears to my eyes.
I:8873;664;I highly recommend this movie.
I:8873;665;I definitely think it is one of Dustin Hoffman's best.
I:8873;666;Even though I had seen it before, I was just as entertained as I was the first time.
I:8873;667;Dustin Hoffman gives a performance that simply astounds us.
I:8873;668;Both of these actors deserve awards for such a touching film about how to treat our family even if we dont understand.
I:8873;669;This proves again that I should never put my confidence in Oscar winners ever again.
I:8873;670;This is one of the best dramas of all time.
I:8873;671;Everything about the movie is funny, dramatic, and heartwarming.
I:8873;672;He brings the authenticity of the disorder.
I:8873;673;Tom Cruise is the perfect person to play the annoyed brother because he can make the biggest jerk sympathetic.
I:8873;674;All in all this movie is great.
I:8873;675;"what can you say except ""most excellent."
I:8873;676;a true classic with a heart.
I:8873;677;Oscar worthy performance by Dustin Hoffman.
I:8873;678;This item came in very good condition.
I:8873;679;Great actors, great job of storytelling and subject matter!!
I:8873;680;And Cruise is at his best.
I:8873;681;Very young and beautiful and without the anger he shows in his more recent films.
I:8873;682;I hear they are making a sequel but I've got this one which I play to my heart's content.
I:8873;683;What matters is the fact that this movie was well written and acted.
I:8873;684;It is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8873;685;Of course great service as always from Amazon.
I:8873;686;"The seminal classic needs no introduction, but among the beautiful lessons I've learnt in the seven times I've watched it with rapt attention:(1) A character incapable of emotional development ironically teaches a ""sane"" man to connect."
I:8873;687;(2) The power of surprising ourselves by changing just that little bit.
I:8873;688;a splendid tale of spiritual transformation and acceptance, of getting in touch with things that transcend materialistic trappings.
I:8873;689;an invaluable possession for every serious collection.
I:8873;690;classic movie that a person never really gets tired of watching and it is a movie that is interesting to show to the younger generation
I:8873;691;Can't believe how excellent D. Hoffman's performance is, as well as T. Cruise and all others.
I:8873;692;So many funny quotes and mannerisms of the characters.
I:8873;693;Arguably Dustin Hoffman's pinnacle achievement as an actor.
I:8873;694;The story is wonderfully told and the film is extremely well directed.
I:8873;695;Overall, however, a masterpiece and one of the best movies of all time.
I:8873;696;i liked the way how dramatic and funny moments go together in the movie making the audience cry in a moment,then giggle.
I:8873;697;the story was good enough to make me realize some things at an early age(As far as I remember when I watched the film for the first time I was 11.12 years old).
I:8873;698;now,I am 18 and still come back to it very often.
I:8873;699;a very good performance by Tom Cruise(I am not a huge fan of his,but still I admit he can act).
I:8873;700;when it comes to Dustin Hoffman the only comment I can make is he is one of the best actors of all time.
I:8873;701;his performance is SUPERB!He is one of my favourite actors and I have seen many of his films.
I:8873;702;i have to go now,so I can't write all the things that I want to write,but I am quite sure you got the general idea.
I:8873;703;and boy does it move SLOWLY!
I:8873;704;and worth watching in this part but that's about all there is in this movie.
I:8873;705;The only reason I didn't give this excellent movie 5 stars is because I do have other favorite movies that I find better than Rain Man and they got my 5 star reviews.
I:8873;706;Dustin Hoffman delivers an exceptionally wonderful performance as Raymond Babbitt, the autistic savant and Tom Cruise delivers a good performance as his younger brother Charlie.
I:8873;707;It's no surprise that Rain Man won Academy Awards for it is a very touching story.
I:8873;708;Great from beginning to end.
I:8873;709;Rain Man will always remain one of the best movies of all times.
I:8873;710;I was very happy with my video.
I:8873;711;It was in very good condition, and it played well.
I:8873;712;It was a great character.
I:8873;713;We both enjoyed the conversion of Cruise's character from a grade a price to a loving brother.
I:8873;714;At its core, this is a story about family secrets, personal discovery, and reconciliation.
I:8873;715;the two performances at the heart of Rain Man are flawless.
I:8873;716;Cruise is great as the fast.
I:8873;717;I remember this great movie from back in the day.
I:8873;718;But I do now, because I work with autism children.
I:8873;719;It is amazing how their mind works.
I:8873;720;RAIN MAN is an excellent film that came out in 1988 when autism was relatively unknown.
I:8873;721;Though no one person on the autism spectrum is likely to exhibit all the traits Raymond Babbitt does Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of him is humane and relatively accurate.
I:8873;722;Tom Cruise is also excellent as Raymond's handsome self absorbed brother, Charlie, and I had almost forgotten what an appealing actor Cruise was as a young man.
I:8873;723;The plot is not too realistic but the movie is so well acted and the setting as the two men drive from Cincinnati to LA so well realized that it is difficult not to be absorbed in this good hearted film with a message.
I:8873;724;Dustin Hoffman is Fantastic in this movie and definitely supports the entire film.
I:8873;725;breakthrough communication between his autistic brother and himself.
I:8873;726;rainman is the most amazing funny movie ever, tis one of my favs.
I:8873;727;dustan hoffman is the best.
I:8873;728;i love all his movies
I:8873;729;remarkable and incredibly well played.
I:8873;730;go for it, you will love it
I:8873;731;This son, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), is autitstic, and Charlie decides in order to get his hands on the inheritence he will pull Raymond from the home and take of him himself.
I:8873;732;What follows is a touching story of the acceptance and understanding of people who are challenged, yet special, as well as a story of changing one's outlook on life as Charlie is forced to examine his own personna and to drop his conniving ways to care for his brother.
I:8873;733;This piece of work is some of the best Cruise has ever done and it's the best film Hoffman has ever acted in.
I:8873;734;It was no surprise the film became a huge boxoffice hit and garnered four Oscars, including Best Actor for Hoffman, Best Screenplay, Best Director for Barry Levinson (who has a cameo in the film), and Best Picture of 1988.
I:8873;735;There are three commentaries, one with Levinson who offers his thoughts on the making of the film.
I:8873;736;"Still, ""Rainman"" is an excellent piece of film work and one that holds up 21 years later."
I:8873;737;It is truely a masterpiece with performances of Hoffman Cruise.
I:8873;738;This was not my personal favorite, but it is a good film.
I:8873;739;I've seen better performances by both Hoffman and Cruise, and the direction felt a little slow and sloppy at times, but you have to credit it overall.
I:8873;740;It's a touching, human story that could have been told a little better.
I:8873;741;found brother and very special person.
I:8873;742;And even if Charlie is easy enough to snub for his superficiality and materialism, his frustration at his inability to communicate with his brother feels genuine and is something we can empathize with(albeit perhaps inadmittedly).
I:8873;743;"As such, his achievement with Raymond Babbitt is breathtaking indeed
I:8873;744;and even among Dustin Hoffman's spectacular performances, this one stands out in particular.
I:8873;745;"(He did, of course, win both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for this movie
I:8873;746;"In addition to Hoffman's awards, ""Rain Man"" received the coveted Oscars for Best Movie, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director (Barry Levinson, who also played the psychiatrist called upon to evaluate whether Raymond is fit to stay with Charlie), plus a number of other American and international awards."
I:8873;747;For once, the industry collectively got it right.
I:8873;748;But even if this movie hadn't received a single award, it would still remain one of recent film history's greatest and truly unforgettable moments .
I:8873;749;also recommended:The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night.
I:8873;750;This movie is great for restoring faith in human beings.
I:8873;751;Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise each give the performance of a lifetime to generate a whale of a movie.
I:8873;752;This is more than entertainment, this is art!!!!
I:8873;753;Dustin Hoffman is at his best, and this is probably one of the best roles of Tom Cruise.
I:8873;754;It is a great movie to see what it is like living with someone with autistic traits.
I:8873;755;The brotherly bond that is established is priceless.
I:8873;756;Just a great movie plain and simple.
I:8873;757;Some adult content and language but still a great movie.
I:8873;758;Excellent movie, back when this came out was the first I had ever heard about Autism.
I:8873;759;Amazing what a difference there is now.
I:8873;760;i would recommend this movie for an enjoyable evenings viewing.
I:8873;761;I enjoyed ordering items that can and will be a blessing to others I am for sure that every person will enjoy a small gift of appreication.
I:8873;762;country trek of pure love and understanding that these two both have.
I:8873;763;"Trying to put the reason that ""Rain Man"" is so great into words is simply impossible."
I:8873;764;Great acting from both leads.
I:8873;765;I would definitely watch this movie again!
I:8873;766;It also gave a pretty accurate portrayal of a Savant during that time.
I:8873;767;One of my favorite movies ever.
I:8873;768;Brilliant performances by Hoffman and Cruise.
I:8873;769;This is what a Oscar winning movie should be.
I:8873;770;Exellent and touching every time you watch it with no disappointments.
I:8873;771;"rays were being released in full frame format
I:8873;772;Taught me about how special life really is and we all need family in our lives.
I:8873;773;I would share this movie with friends.
I:8873;774;When you want to see what love can do.
I:8873;775;Will still bring tears to your eyes.
I:8873;776;I saw the movie on tv and wanted to see it again.
I:8873;777;This clearly sheds the light on Tom's selfishness.
I:8873;778;the story, character selection and the screenplay make it a definitely a worth watching movie!
I:8873;779;This is one of my favorite moives of all time.
I:8873;780;Rain man is a delight to watch.
I:8873;781;It manages to hold up very well, though, due to the touching story/acting combination between the principle characters.
I:8873;782;Cruise is always solid, and Hoffman turns in the kind of special performance that I now almost exclusively associate his name with.
I:8873;783;take with each other is priceless and provides some iconic cinema moments that will last long into the ages.
I:8873;784;overall, Rain Main is a dramatic gem that will forever hold at the very least a niche in Hollywood lore for its unique performances.
I:8873;785;It's an all time classic.
I:8873;786;What can I say, you have to see this movie to judge for yourself.
I:8873;787;It's a movie about love between two brothers, one is much younger and very successful in life (Charlie Babbitt, played by Tom Cruise) and the other is the autistic older brother (Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman, he got an acadamy award for this one), who is institutionalized.
I:8873;788;For a special edition re.
I:8873;789;release it still kind of sucks.
I:8873;790;this is a masterpiece of a film, and it should NOT be missed.
I:8873;791;rain man is one of the exceptions.
I:8873;792;it has a good story told w/o too much of the schmaltz hollywood usually likes to pile onto feel.
I:8873;793;cruise, otoh, was very convincing, first as the hot.
I:8873;794;i was impressed by the transformation.
I:8873;795;but i was genuinely impressed.
I:8873;796;so, the film that started the stampede to films about emotionally disabled people still holds up well.
